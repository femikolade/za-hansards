<p>Whether any provision is or was enforced at the University College for Indians prohibiting students from making personal contact with white students; if so, (a) when and (a) by whom was such provision introduced</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_indian_affairs" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>In terms of Regulation 82 (8) of the regulations promulgated under the Extension of University Education Act, 1959, students of student bodies must obtain the approval of the Rector of the University College, Durban before meetings other than that of approved student committees are held within the precincts of the College.</p>

<p>During 1961 the Rector was approached by N.U.S.A.S. with a request to make contact with the students of the University College. N.U.S.A.S. was informed that its request would be considered if it was prepared to co-operate with the University College in all respects and recognized the Rector as the Head of the College.</p>

<p>In the course of 1969 a request by the Student&#x2019;s Debating Society for Mr. Peter Behr, a member of the Executive Committee of N.U.S.A.S. (which body had not responded to the Rector&#x2019;s conditions as laid down in 1961) to address the students of the College on the subject of &#x201C;Organizations and Responsibilities&#x201C; was refused by the Rector.</p>

<p>Bakeries are registered with the Wheat Industry Control Board to bake bread and confectionery but confectioneries are registered to bake confectionery only.</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) The opening of new bakeries and confectioneries is controlled by registration in terms of section 29 of the Winter Cereal Scheme. Registration certificates are not granted on a per capita basis. Applications for new bakeries are granted at centres in which the urban development and growth in population warrants the granting of further bread baking units in the particular bread delivery area. The Cape Town delivery area comprises the area covered by the above districts excluding Malmesbury. Application for new confectioneries are granted more freely in order that consumers can readily obtain good quality confectionery within reasonable distance.

<p>In pursuance of this policy new confectioneries are granted upon application in new suburbs and in shopping centres provided such confectioneries are not situated too close to one another.</p></li>

<li>(3) In 1969 one new bakery for bread and confectionery was refused in Bellville and one in Malmesbury because the Board was of the opinion that further bread baking units are not warranted at present in Malmesbury where there is one existing bakery in town and two further bakeries in the district of Malmesbury. The application for a bakery in Bellville was refused as this centre is situated in the Cape Town delivery area which is adequately served by established bakeries.

<p>In Cape Town five applications for new confectioneries were refused during 1969. These applications were refused as the proposed confectioneries would be situated too close to existing ones who were supplying good quality and service.</p></li>

<heading>Steps taken by S.A. Defence Force as a result of Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report on Stores Accounting</heading>

<question by="#morrison" to="#minister_of_defence">

<num>*25.</num>

<from>Dr. G. DE V. MORRISON</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to certain remarks by the Controller and Auditor-General in his Report for 1968-&#x2019;69 as a result of stores inspections in the Department of Defence;</li>

<li>(2) whether he has taken any steps in this connection; if so, what steps.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#morrison">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) Yes, continuous attention was given to the matter. It is a problem which must be viewed against the background of the tremendous expansion of the Defence Force since 1961. Hon. members are aware of the reasons for this expansion. Since 1961 the total value of main equipment and its accessories increased by R660 million to its present level of more than R2,000 million, which entails approximately one million separate accounts. Another contributing factor was the divided control over the stores-administration of the Defence Force which existed prior to the abolishment of the Defence Secretariate. After discussions with me, the Commandant-General tackled the problem systematically by appointing, in the first place, an experienced senior Officer and a departmental stores inspector to identify the extent of the problem and to make recommendations as to how the situation could be braved. The Committee found that the situation with regard to stores accounting in the Air Force and the Navy was, due to the smaller extent of the task, reasonably satisfactory. As a result of the committee&#x2019;s report it has been decided, as a first step, to concentrate on the Army with preference to the Permanent Force depots as the Citizen Force and Commandos hold only minimal stores in comparison with the Permanent Force. Consequently the following corrective measures were taken:

<ol>

<li>(a) Experienced Army quartermaster personnel in posts not directly connected with stores administration, were withdrawn and grouped in teams to examine and rectify unit stores accounts.</li>

<li>(b) The departmental stores inspectors were ordered to assist unit quartermaster personnel to to rectify faults during their inspections.</li>

<li>(c) Instructions were issued that redundant, obsolete and unserviceable equipment in unit stores were to be returned to main stores depots to make space available for items in use.</li>

<li>(d) Establishment tables were expanded to make provision for sufficient stores personnel on all levels.</li>

<li>(e) Salaries and career prospects of stores personnel for both other ranks and Officers&#x2019; ranks have been improved to retain experienced personnel and to stimulate recruiting. As a result hereof, a marked improvement in the stores personnel position has already set in.</li>

<li>(f) Training of stores personnel has been rationalized with a view to better training for their task in a shorter space of time. Special courses were introduced for unit commanders to qualify them properly for their task as supervisors over stores under their control.</li>

<li>(g) The provision of suitably equipped and safe stores for equipment and under-cover accommodation for vehicles was allocated a higher priority on the building programmes. More than R7 million was spent on this over the past three years. Nearly R13 million will be spent during the next 5 years.</li>

<li><span class="col_1527-1528" refersTo="page_0777"/>(h) A comprehensive guide on stores administration was compiled and issued to unit commanders and quartermaster personnel of the Army.</li>

<li>(i) One of the most serious problems is the identification of technical stores. Consequently, the codification of stores accounts in accordance with the well-proved NATO-codification system and the automation thereof have been stepped up.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>The steps which were taken to bring about an improvement, of course, needed time before the effect thereof became noticeable. [Interjections.] This is my reply to the allegation concerning abuses made here by the hon. member for Yeoville yesterday. Definite signs there of was already noticeable in the financial year in question as was substantiated by the departmental chief inspector who reported, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows in his annual report for 1968/69:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;I am pleased to report an all-round improvement in Army Stores Accounting as will be evident from the following details setting out the position at the seven inspector at areas.&#x201D;</block>

<p>With certain reservations and exceptions it applies to:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Witwatersrand Command.</li>

<li>(b) Western Province Command.</li>

<li>(c) Orange Free State Command.</li>

<li>(d) Eastern Province Command.</li>

<li>(e) Natal Command.</li>

<li>(f) North Western Command.</li>

</ol>

<p>Northern Transvaal Command is the only command where no progress had been reported and special attention is now being given to this.</p>

<p>Although the situation is not yet entirely satisfactory it is, thanks to the timeous and drastic steps, not as un-favourable as it is portrayed in general terms in the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s report. The corrective steps are pursued energetically and there is no reason to believe that a slide back will take place. I am convinced that the report for the 1969/70 financial year will be even more favourable. The position in the Air Force and Navy is satisfactory and under control.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<li>(1) That notwithstanding the provisions of the resolution adopted on 2nd February and of Standing Order No. 22&#x2014;

<ol>

<li><span class="col_1543-1544" refersTo="page_0785"/>(a) the hours of sitting from Monday, 23rd February, to Thursday, 26th February, shall be:

<p>2.15 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</p>

<p>8 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.</p></li>

<li>(b) Saturday, 28th February, shall be a sitting day;</li>

<li>(2) that the provisions of Standing Order No. 23 (Automatic Adjournment) shall be suspended with effect from Friday, 27th February;</li>

<li>(3)that on Friday, 27th February, and Saturday, 28th February, the House shall meet at 10 a.m., business being suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 2.15 p.m.; and </li>

<li>(4) that the provisions of Standing Order No. 49 (Stages of Bills) shall be suspended with effect from Monday, 23rd February, for the remainder of the Session.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Government regards Orders of the Day Nos. 1 to 15 as essential measures which must be dealt with by the House before Parliament adjourns. It is therefore necessary for the House of Assembly to sit for longer hours as from Monday in order to enable the House to dispose of all these various Orders of the Day. We are hoping that the House of Assembly will be able to adjourn by the end of next week, but this of course depends on hon. members. If they restrain themselves a little in discussing certain of the more contentious measures, the House of Assembly may be able to adjourn earlier, but that is completely in the hands of the Opposition. I also want to say that if it is absolutely essential. Parliament will have to sit in the following week as well and then the nomination date will simply have to be postponed for a week, but if hon. members co-operate, we can adjourn at the end of next week.</p>

<p>Legislation by exhaustion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to register the protest of this side of the House to the motion before the House. To our mind this motion is unnecessary, and it is unnecessary because much of the legislation that the Government desires to put through need not have been introduced during this short Session of Parliament. All that was really necessary was to pass the Part Appropriation and Additional Appropriation Bills to run the various services of the country. An opportunity would obviously also have presented itself to pass a certain amount of legislation. In fact. if that had been done the House could have risen to-day. That could have been the position. We have, of course, spent some time on legislation. Moreover, some of this legislation is of a controversial nature. I do not think that the House does itself justice in agreeing to motions of this type. I think the reaction of the public outside is this: If Parliament wants to do its business in this way, it seems to be foolish, but let them get on with it. They do not approve of this manner of passing legislation in Parliament. When this sort of thing happens there is a tendency for debate to cease on some of these measures because what happens is that Government members do not participate in the debate, in order to get the legislation through; Opposition members put forward their points of view and the various measures are not fully debated. I do not think it is in the interests of Parliament to have such a situation arising. The test, the barometer of the success of a session, seems to be how many Bills Parliament can churn out. If it passes a record number of Bills, then it has been a wonderful session. Sir, I believe the test is just the opposite. The test of a good session of Parliament is how few Bills it has been necessary to put through in order to govern the country. More and more in this country we are creating a situation where the test has been how many Bills have been passed during a session. I do not think that is a good thing. I think sometimes it is a very bad thing and on occasions it is almost a disaster for the country.</p>

<p>Then in regard to the last tag of the motion, i.e. to do away with the right under Rule 49 of three members to object to the stage of a Bill, I regret that the hon. the Leader of the House has seen fit to put this forward. It may be argued that this is a temporary alteration, but it is an alteration of a rule that caused a great deal of discussion when the Rules were altered, and they were altered by agreement. Prior to that, it had been possible in this House for one member to object to a further stage of a Bill. I can recollect very vividly that the then member for Illovo. Mr. Marwick. took it upon himself time after time at the end of a session to object to the next stage of a Bill when it was quite unnecessary to do so. This resulted in a great deal of expense because the reprinting of a Bill costs a great deal of money.</p>

<p>Others did the same thing, and therefore it became necessary to give consideration to the alteration of this rule. But, Sir, there has not been a tittle of evidence of abuse of the present rule&#x2014;not on any occasion. The Opposition has been most responsible, and I may say&#x2014; and I think it is the right thing&#x2014;that we have been able to arrive at agreement as to when the various stages of Bills will be taken. Over the last few years a spirit has grown up which is all to the good from the point of view of Parliament and its workings. We have been able to come to an understanding with regard to the business of the House. There have been differences, but generally speaking there has been agreement and there have been no real difficulties. Here this right to object to the next <span class="col_1545-1546" refersTo="page_0786"/>stage of a Bill is being taken away from the? Opposition.</p>

<p>I may say, Sir, that there are still some very controversial Bills on the Order Paper. Does the Leader of the House intend, in the case, of Bills which have been partly disposed of and others which have not yet been taken, to force them through in all their stages, one after the other? I do not think that should be done in this Parliament. This motion makes it possible for the Government to do so. My experience has been that taking a Bill through all its stages at once, has, with rare exceptions, been to the detriment of the House and Parliament. I have never regretted having held up the next stage of a Bill but I have regretted allowing a Bill to go through all stages at once, for the very reason that representations are made to the parties in the meantime; different points of view are put to members, and things that you never thought of crop up after a Bill has been given publicity 3t one of its stages.</p>

<p>If a Bill is not put through in all its stages on the same day, you then have an opportunity of putting forward those points of view, if they are sound and valid ones, and of having them discussed in Parliament. This motion deprives Parliament of that opportunity, and I do not think that this is in the interests of Parliament. This motion seems rather innocent, but it nevertheless seems to savour a little of the guillotine mentality the Government shows from time to time. They display a readiness to take an opportunity, or threaten sometimes, to alter the Rules because some occasion which has arisen has perhaps caused those Rules to be not quite to their advantage. Mr. Speaker, the Rules of this House are for all members of the House of Assembly and for all parties, and not for the one side of the House alone. I feel that when such proposals are made, the most careful and serious consideration should be given to them before they are put before this House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the House has told us what legislation has to be passed this Session. He said that items 1 to 15 on the Order Paper had to be disposed of. That is quite a considerable legislative programme. Even in the case of Bills which one may call agreed measures, it is not a bad thing for a point of view to be aired in this House, so that the country may know what the legislation is about. I believe that this sort of resolution does not make that possible. Therefore, this side of the House protests.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to reply to two points raised by the hon. member for Von Brandis. In fact, he made only two important points. One is that, in his opinion, the Government intends to proceed with legislation which is not important. I think it is a tradition in this House that the Government itself decides which legislation is important to it and which is not. The Opposition may as well leave it to the Government to decide about it in this case too. The Government will know best which legislation it wants passed and which not.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised a second point, with reference to the proposed suspension of the provisions of Standing Order No. 49, which will dispense with the practice that objection may be made to two or more readings being taken on the same day. I want to ask the hon. the Chief Whip whether he knows why Bills were originally submitted to Parliament for several readings. Originally, several readings of a Bill were taken because members of Parliament were, by tradition, unable to read. It was customary for the Speaker to appoint a person to read the Bill that was before the House, from beginning to end. [Interjections.] Sir, it seems to me as if there are hon. members on the opposite side who still cannot read to-day. It was customary for the Speaker to order the Secretary or the Clerk, who was in actual fact a priest, to read the Bill. Members of Parliament at the time could not, however, remember for such a long period, and the Bill therefore had to be read again the following day in order to refresh their memories. In earlier times Bills were in fact read as many as eight times. As recently as 1946 a British Bill was inadvertently read four times. Only when it appeared later on that the several readings were being used to delay Bills was a decision taken that there should be a fixed number of readings. Indeed, that was when the number of three was decided upon, on account of the sacredness of this number in the Bible. That is why Bills have been read three times ever since. The principle of the matter is that Members of Parliament have the complete Bill before them to-day, as from its first reading. A Bill need no longer be read out to a member to remind him what it contains, because he has it before him all the time. He can make a study of it, and when it has been read a first time he can already decide precisely what his attitude is going to be. During all the readings he can consult the Bill again. That is why this practice has in fact fallen away. It is a tradition which has no meaning any more for us in the modern world, where Members of Parliament can read and write. I think it is something which is completely old-fashioned, something to which Parliament need not really be tied down, and Parliament will not collapse if we do away with it temporarily. As a matter of fact, as hon. members know, this rule does not apply strictly in the Other Place any more. In other words, Parliamentary tradition itself has already watered down the rule to a large extent. I therefore think the hon. the Chief Whip is quite wrong in saying that we are breaking down a tradition or a convention of Parliament, and that it will encroach upon other Parliamentary customs as well. I do not, however, begrudge him his objection. It is his privilege to raise it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I shall be very brief. I should just like to place on <span class="col_1547-1548" refersTo="page_0787"/>record the frustrating of the Opposition in connection with this motion. I also want to express my concern at the kind of argument which the hon. member for Middelland used, because it is indicative of an attitude to the procedure of this Parliament which gives rise to deep anxiety. Apparently the idea in the mind of at least one of the Whips on the Government side is that the rules of this House should be curtailed even more, and that it should be done on a permanent basis.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the impression one gets, but I do not want to go into that. This whole action is contrary to the attitude adopted by the Opposition and the Government when, under the late Dr. Verwoerd, it was decided to simplify the rules of the House so that the proceedings could be expedited. The Opposition made great sacrifices at the time, because the aim was to achieve unanimity. It was decided that nothing would be altered unless it could be done by a unanimous decision. The Opposition made the sacrifices, but now it still happens every session that the Leader of the House proposes a measure which is contrary to that gentlemen&#x2019;s agreement. I just want to register my protest at this. I also want to point out that it is not worth the trouble to ask Parliament to accept this curtailment of its rights merely for the sake of the kind of legislation which the Government regards as essential. Except for a few Bills dealing with pensions, virtually all these Bills are unnecessary. Many of them are controversial and ideological measures which could just as well wait until July. There are few measures on this Order Paper which are really to the benefit of the ordinary citizen of South Africa. If these measures were aimed at providing real benefits to the citizens of South Africa, the Opposition would still have cooperated, but, with two exceptions, all these Bills are ideological ones. Therefore we want to protest most strongly This step is unnecessary. It is not in the interests of the people, nor is it in the interests of Parliament. It is arbitrary and it definitely does not enhance the prestige and the status of our legislative institutions.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I naturally anticipated that the Opposition would object. If they had not objected, they would not have been worthy of being an Opposition. That goes without saying. If I were in the Opposition, I too would object to any curtailment of rights. I just want to say, however, that the suspension of the provisions of Standing Order No. 49 is nothing new or nothing unusual. It was done in 1960. It is only a precautionary measure which is taken. It does not mean that it will be applied as from Monday, or that all the stages of all the Bills coming before the House will be taken forthwith. It is merely a precautionary measure, because the position to-day is quite different from what it was before. We cannot allow three or four members to object to certain stages on the last day, when Parliament must adjourn, so that Parliament would then have to sit the following week. This is therefore a precautionary measure which will perhaps not be used.</p>

<p>Just take the legislation to which hon. members are objecting so strenuously. Except for two of the items on the Order Paper, they support all the measures. The hon. member for Yeoville has probably not read any of these Bills.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know that hon. member. He is so superficial that he never studies anything properly. He never does his homework. All these Bills are in fact important measures. The two which are controversial relate to Bantu. There has never been a Bantu Bill before this House which the Opposition did not oppose. The moment we mention the word &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; they are up in arms immediately and then they talk about it for weeks. They intend to do the same in the case of this legislation. After all, I saw what happened in the Committee State of that one Bill yesterday. If hon. members tell me that there was no unnecessary talking yesterday and that there was no unnecessary wasting of time, I do not know what wasting of time is. I have been in this Parliament for many years, and I know when time is being wasted and when deliberate attempts are being made to delay the business of the House. These two Bills must go through. Let us consider a few of the other Bills. The hon. members are constantly complaining about the manpower shortage. This is one of the main themes of all their speeches. With the Industrial Conciliation Amendment Bill an attempt is being made to do something in that connection, but they say that it is unnecessary and that it need not come before the House this Session.</p>

<p>Let us take the next item on the Order Paper, the Anatomical Donations and Post-Mortem Examinations Bill. All the medical practitioners are asking for this. Then there is the National Monuments Amendment Bill. This is a simple little Bill which all of them will support. Then there is the Wine and Spirits Control Amendment Bill, which the agricultural industry wants very badly. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also wants this Bill to be placed on the Statute Book. Or does he not want it?</p>

<p>My colleague the hon. the Minister of Agriculture must really not allow any delay in doing this. He must go and talk to the Leader of the Opposition about it, because then it will have a speedier passage through the House. Mr. Speaker, I can continue in this way. As I have said, there are only two controversial Bills. I just want to point out that the next session will be devoted mainly to the Budget. There will not be much opportunity for legislation. Besides, the Bills which are not passed, will then have to be introduced anew. Those hon. members say they are going to come into power. Then they can, after all, arrange the Order Paper as they think fit in July. They can then drop the Bills which they do not like. In any case, it will be a short session and there will not be much opportunity of dealing with legislation, and therefore as much as possible of this important legislation must go through this Session, as was done in 1966. In 1966 we had to deal with one of the most controversial of Bills, namely a Suppression of Communism Amendment Bill. That Bill went through and it was discussed thoroughly. Although the Opposition objected strenuously to that Bill, they did not waste time. Then there is another thing. I think they are far keener to return to their constituencies than we are, because they have to fight for their lives; they are on the defensive, while we are on the attack. They will have to defend for all that they are worth so as not to lose their seats.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this House is being asked to accept the excision of certain scheduled land, known as Reserve No. 6, near Richard&#x2019;s Bay, and its replacement by another piece of State-owned land bordering on Mozambique.</p>

<p>We are not opposed to the excision of Reserve No. 6, which, as I have stated, lies near Richard&#x2019;s Bay. We realize that it will be required for the development which is to take place there. But what we are worried about in the first place, is what is to happen to the Bantu living in that reserve at present. When the Select Committee considered this matter, we were unable to get details from the department as to where these Bantu were to be placed. The only information we received, was that at the moment they are concentrating them in a certain portion of this reserve, but ultimately they may go to Reserve No. 5 and Reserve No. 10. But it was not thought that any of them would go to the land which has been exchanged. We feel that before an excision of this nature takes place and the House gives its permission to the excision, we should know what is going to happen to the people who are occupying the area which is to be excised. As I say, we have been unable to get that information.</p>

<p>Our main objection to this measure is that the land which is to be exchanged, is at present State-owned land which borders on Mozambique. In doing this, approximately 12 miles of our frontier on the boundary between Mozambique and South Africa, will with the Government&#x2019;s stated policy of giving the reserves independence ultimately, eventually become part of a sovereign independent Bantu state. We will be handing over our boundary to a foreign state. We are opposed to that. I know that the Minister will probably say that the land alongside Reserve No. 14 already abuts on the State of Mozambique, and that it is therefore nothing new. But I submit that because that is so, it is no reason why we should give up more of our boundary to what will eventually become an independent state. We should rather go the other way and try and retain the whole of the borderline under the control of the Government of the Republic. Alongside of the Ingwavuma land, which is to be exchanged, is the Ndumu Game Reserve, which the Government of the Republic will be keeping out, for the time being at any rate. We feel that the line should go from the Ndumu Game Reserve further along and right across down to the coast, and that that land should be retained as part of the Republic. Because of these objections we will oppose this proposed excision.</p>

<speech by="#torlage">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Transkei only raised two points here. In the first place the hon. member wanted to know where the present residents of Reserve No. 6 were going to. In the second place he expressed his concern about this, as he called it, 12 mile international boundary which is thereby being created. I immediately want to say that I do not believe that there will be any difference of opinion between the hon. members of the Opposition and ourselves on the basic point that Reserve No. 6 as such must disappear. I think that hon. members opposite and ourselves will agree that, with the new development that is going to take place at Richard&#x2019;s Bay, it is necessary for Reserve No. 6 there to disappear. We shall not quarrel about this. Nor do I believe that hon. members opposite are going to quarrel about it, because it is a new development that is coming and that is going to be applied for the purpose of industrial expansion. It will also be applied for the establishment of townships. It is an altogether new development that will take place here. Whoever the inhabitants of that area may be, they would have been hit by this new complication. It so happens that in this case there are Bantu living in the area. At present there are 647 families living there. This represents a total of 5,579 individuals. At present these people in that reserve own 2,568 items of large stock and, in addition, about 400 items of small stock. But we must <span class="col_1553-1554" refersTo="page_0790"/>now bear in mind that these 5,579 individuals are not all employees. They are not all working units. Only a percentage of these people are in employment. I now immediately want to add that in the Richard&#x2019;s Bay complex there are at present about 200 Bantu employees. New contractors arrived there with Bantu from elsewhere. In other words, these Bantu living in Reserve No. 6 still have the prospect of new employment opportunities which are going to be created for them as a result of the new project. I want hon. members opposite to weigh up this new work sphere against the removal of the Bantu from Reserve No. 6. But now I want to state immediately that the present inhabitants of Reserve No. 6 will not necessarily be shifted to the land that is being offered to them as compensation. In fact, the present inhabitants of Reserve No. 6, who already work in the Richard&#x2019;s Bay complex and want to work there, or who, as a result of new employment opportunities that are developing, would want to work there, may for residential purposes as the hon. member for Transkei said, be resettled not only in Reserves No. 5 and 10, but also in No. 9, where a township is also being established. But new townships will also be established in Reserves No. 5 and 10. In other words, in the Richard&#x2019;s Bay complex where this new project is in progress, there will be more opportunities for the establishment of townships into which these people can be assimilated. Here the people will be able to obtain houses. I now want to say that the Bantu Commissioner consulted the interested parties. In consultation with these people this entire matter was explained to them. The expected complications and the development associated with it were explained to them. These people understood this. Their reaction was favourable when they heard of these new developments; they realized the implications of the developments. They only had one request, i.e. that they should obtain a job at the new project. This will mean that many of them who have to go and work elsewhere at present, for example on the mines in Johannesburg and in other towns throughout the Republic, will now be in a position to obtain work there, near their families. This is something altogether new to them and they accept it in that light. They were promised that they would be assimilated into those new jobs when the jobs came along.</p>

<p>Why were we not told about that in the Select Committee?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#torlage">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>It was given to hon. members in a nutshell by officials of the department. But, in addition, any intelligent person ought to know that these are the prospects for those people. Had the hon. member for Transkei only given it a little thought yesterday or the day before, he would have joined me in realizing that this was the position, because he already accepts it now. These people were also informed that, apart from this new employment which is going to be created for them and which is in the offing in this area, there is also compensatory land available which will be given to them. I want to emphasize that the State land which is now to be included is not the poorest of agricultural land. On the contrary, parts of it and also parts of the adjoining reserves are relatively good agricultural land. We cannot get away from this fact. The industrial and mining potential of this land is not known and has not been investigated. Neither is it at all relevant at this stage. As hon. members are aware, section 3 (b) (i) of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, provides that the compensatory land should have a pastoral or agricultural value at least equivalent to that of the land that is being excised. It is an important point at this stage. The intention behind this is simply to prevent the Bantu homelands from decreasing in pastoral and agricultural value as a result of excisions and inclusions. It is a protective measure. The State land which is now being offered is not necessarily compensatory land for the Bantu now living in Reserve No. 6. Neither is this land calculated in order to determine the quota of Trust-acquired land. I want this to be very clear. During the meeting between the Bantu Commissioner and the Bantu Captains and their followers it was common cause that people who would decide to go to the Bantu townships would not be able to take their livestock with them. Furthermore, it was explained that if someone wanted to take his livestock with him, and if he did not want to work in the vicinity, his case would be considered on merit. An open authorization for the removal of livestock or for their placement in other areas can therefore under no circumstances be given, particularly not at this stage. This goes without saying, because the reserves are full. Consequently all cases must be treated on merit as they submit applications.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of the international borders. This is the second point raised by the hon. member for Transkei. At present it is the custom for the department to grant grazing rights right up to the border, even though it is an international border. For the purposes of occupation the department ensures that a strip of between two to three miles from that border is left unoccupied. This is for security considerations, patrolling, etc., to which thorough consideration is given. It is also important to keep the families away from the families on the other side of the border. If this is not done border arrangements with our neighbouring states are simply hampered. In respect of the provision of labour and the movements of people to and fro across the border we have arrangements with Mozambique, Rhodesia, Malawi, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho. Passport control posts have been established for this purpose. I want to make it very clear now that a great deal could be said about the control of international borders. We could argue about that for a very long time. It goes without saying that there can be various standpoints in respect of international borders. However, I want to plead for the <span class="col_1555-1556" refersTo="page_0791"/>question of principle in respect of international borders not to be linked with this case. Because why should this be done? We have hundreds of miles in the rest of the Republic of South Africa where there are already international borders. Why should the question now be linked with this specific case of a mere 12 miles?</p>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>It is a very bad position and does the hon. member now want to increase it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#torlage">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, only 12 miles. I want to adopt the standpoint that if this question of international boundaries must be discussed, it should be discussed as a matter of principle. I simply cannot understand why hon. members specifically want to link it to this case. If this were to be done the entire nature of this case would change. This goes without saying, and I therefore feel that we should not link it with that. The fact is that we have similar cases throughout the country, and why do hon. members specifically want to link it to this case? Is it not because hon. members opposite agree that it is right, accept that the people of Reserve No. 6 must disappear and because they accept that the development entails this, but then they want to add that it cannot be done for certain political reasons. To justify this they now jump around and look for loopholes in order to start arguments. I say that this does not belong here and I cannot, under any circumstances, see that it does.</p>

<p>I now want to conclude by saying that in my opinion we must bear in mind that according to international law it is not possible for a State to negotiate with another subordinate state without the permission of the sovereign state. This is a policy question we can discuss in respect of all the areas where we have international borders. However, we cannot link it to this specific case where it is a question of about 12 miles. I think we all realize how far-reaching this question could be, and I therefore want to express the hope that it will not be linked to this particular case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened with pleasure to the swan-song of the hon. member for Klip River. I am sure we will miss the hon. member in this House. The hon. member for Klip River says we are opposing this matter purely for political reasons. I want to remind the hon. member that he has told me repeatedly, and other hon. members on this side, that there are no votes for us amongst the Bantu. I want to remind the hon. member of those words. We are not opposing this for political reasons. We want to see fair play done. The hon. member knows that on the Select Committee we were presented with a half-baked scheme. He knows perfectly well that on the Select Committee the hon. member for South Coast made it perfectly clear that we agree that Reserve No. 6 must go. We agree that Reserve No. 6 must go, but let us have a scheme for the handling of the people who are resident there to-day. The hon. member told us that there are 5,579 souls in that area.</p>

<p>They do not have a scheme according to which they will deal with those people. We were told in the Select Committee&#x2014;and that hon. member confirmed it just now&#x2014;that they are now being temporarily moved to some corner of the reserve. He said that these people were voluntarily moving into a corner of Reserve No. 6, farthest removed from where the development is taking place until such time as some plan can be made for their accommodation. When it was asked where they would be accommodated, the answer was: &#x201C;We do not know at this stage. We anticipate that a township will be built in Reserve No. 5, which is about five miles away. Another township will be built in Reserve No. 10, which is between eight and ten miles away. These will be built in the future. Possibly these people could be accommodated there.&#x201D; A question was put directly to the Secretary of the Department as to whether these people can be accommodated in the reserves in the vicinity. He replied that that would not be possible because they are full. That hon. member confirmed it now when he spoke. They just want to take these people away.</p>

<p>Let me say that they are acting fully in terms of the letter of the law. The letter of the law, as the hon. member pointed out, lays down that the Trust must get compensatory land of at least an equal pastoral and agricultural value. Let us have a look at that. We have the position where 4,800 hectares, a little over 12,0 acres, of a pastoral value of R1,020,533, which works out at R210 per hectare or R80 per acre, are being excised from the Trust land and being compensated for with 30,354 hectares or nearly 100,000 acres, an excess of 90,0 acres. The pastoral or agricultural value of this piece of land is around R1,026,540, R7 more than the other, but it is almost nine times the size and works out at R28 per hectare or R11 per acre. I want to place on record that from my own knowledge of the area, Reserve No. 6 is grossly undervalued and the State land which is being given to the reserve is grossly overvalued. The hon. the Minister knows that that land has already been condemned by the Veterinary Department when it comes to the keeping of stock in that area. He knows that it is white sandveld and that there is no grazing on it. He knows that it has been condemned by the Department of Agriculture from the point of view of irrigation. The most damning point of all is that he knows that that whole area is already occupied by Bantu. In fact, one could say that it is already overstocked with people.</p>

<p>The hon. member has made the point that the Department does not necessarily have to give the Bantu removed from the piece of ground to be excised, that portion which is to be added. I accept that. But what are they going to do with these people? We do not know what they are going to do with them. <span class="col_1557-1558" refersTo="page_0792"/>The Department does not know what they are going to do with them. They perhaps have plans for the future, if these people are put into these townships which may be developed in these reserves, what will happen to their stock? The hon. member gave figures in this regard. He spoke too quickly and I could not quite catch the figures he mentioned. However, these figures indicated that there are some thousands of head of stock in that area at the moment. These people have led this type of agricultural and pastoral life. What will happen to their stock if they are moved to the townships? Are they going to be permitted to keep their stock? Where will they be permitted to keep their stock?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Klip River said that the Bantu Affairs Commissioner had consulted with the people in this reserve. I wonder how that consultation took place. I accept that they were consulted and were told what the Government&#x2019;s plans were. The hon. member said that their attitude was favourable. &#x201C;Gunstig,&#x201D; was the term that he used. We put this question directly to the Secretary of the Department in the Select Committee. That is not the answer that was given by the Secretary. The answer given by the Secretary was that they had accepted it &#x201C;tacitly&#x201D;. When we questioned him further on this tacit acceptance, he said it was tacit acceptance because they were moving their kraals to this corner of the reserve where the Department intends to concentrate the Bantu. Was this once again a case of departmental officials being instructed to go to these Bantu and tell them what is happening and once again a case of the Bantu saying: &#x201C;umtetho ka uHulumeni,&#x201D; this is the law of the Government and we accept it. These are law-abiding people and they are being pushed around. They are being pushed around here in a half-baked scheme. This whole Government has gone off half-cocked in the development at Richard&#x2019;s Bay.</p>

<p>We do not oppose this development. We want to see the development. We have said this reserve must be excised if it is in the road of development. We accept that it is in the road of development. However, let this Department and this Government come with some idea of what they will do with these people before they ask this House to approve such a motion. The hon. member said that the Bantu would be settled in the adjoining reserves. He made the point that there was good agricultural ground in those adjoining reserves. But he knows that they are overstocked, not only with animals, but with people as well. He knows that there are more people than those reserves can carry. There is another question which arises. Are these people in Reserve No. 6, a tribe on their own? Are they a section of the tribes in reserves Nos. 4, 5, 9 or 10, or are they all part of the same tribe who are living in separate units? This is something which has to be considered. We were told in the Select Committee that any of these Bantu who wanted to move to the land on the boundary at Ingwavuma will be permitted to do so. The hon. member is aware of conditions in Zululand and he knows that those people will never move up there because of the factions. The one lot are uSuthu and the other are Mandhlakazi. They will not mix.</p>

<p>Has the hon. the Minister consulted with the hon. the Minister of Agriculture on this question of the international boundary? I believe he controls the State land. I know that other negotiations have been taking place in connection with portion of this land which it is proposed to now be handed over to the Bantu Trust. In connection with those negotiations, this whole question of international boundaries has been considered. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has been consulted. Has he agreed to the handing over of this land to the Bantu Trust? Can the hon. the Deputy Minister tell us?</p>

If this is to become an independent state, it means that our South African international boundary will be in the hands of this Bantu government.</p>

<p>To summarize, we are not opposed to the excision of Reserve No. 6; we are not opposed to development in the Richard&#x2019;s Bay area, but all that we ask is that before we approve this excision, the Department and the hon. the Deputy Minister must come to this House with some definite concrete plan of what they intend to do with these 5,000 odd souls in that area.</p>

<p><span class="col_1559-1560" refersTo="page_0793"/>The two speakers on that side of the House, who spoke about this matter, made fairly superficial allegations. I want to make the assertion that, since we are here dealing with the removal of Bantu from the scheduled Bantu area of Reserve No. 6 and giving certain other compensatory land in return, we are, in fact, engaged in the policy of separate development. Irrespective of the development at Richard&#x2019;s Bay, we are here dealing with a separate reserve which would, in the future, have had to be removed in any case in terms of our policy. That process is only being hastened. But because hon. members on the other side of the House realize that the removal of these Bantu are in line with the execution of our policy, they are opposed to it. I should like the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) to listen now. I want to make the prediction that within a month or so that hon. member is going to get onto the platforms in Natal, particularly in Pietermaritzburg, and tell the people that they must be careful because a Bantustan is developing five miles from their City Hall.</p>

<p>Exactly. Those are the stories they will tell. Their basic motive is their opposition to the policy of separate development. Just to frighten people those hon. members are once more going to ask the question: &#x201C;Where will the borders be?&#x201D; Here we are specifically indicating to them &#x201C;where the borders will be&#x201D;. Reserve No. 6 is being removed and transferred to another place with a view to the consolidation of areas.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Let us now pursue this argument in a logical fashion. Reserve No. 6 lies between Richard&#x2019;s Bay. where the new harbour is going to be built, and the small town Empangeni, i.e. precisely where a white urban area with a large industrial concentration is going to develop. Hon. member are not happy about the removal of Reserve No. 6. in spite of the fact that they know that it is going to be a large urban complex. If Reserve No. 6 were to be left in its present position many Bantu would have to be housed there. Hon. members opposite would then be the first to say that it is the Government that is allowing all these Bantu in a white urban complex. This is precisely what they are now doing in respect of other cities. The Government is now removing the possibility of a large concentration of these people within a white complex.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is that the attitude of hon. members borders on hypocrisy where they are supposedly pleading &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw the word, Mr. Speaker. Those hon. members&#x2019; motive is something quite different. What is actually upsetting them is the execution of the policy we are dealing with here. It is now being said that this is a half-baked scheme. In the Select Committee the hon. member had the amplest opportunity, and made use of it, to put questions to the officials about this matter. All the information he wanted was given to him. This is not a half-baked scheme. It was put to him very clearly&#x2014;and this also serves as a reply to the hon. member for Transkei&#x2014;that, in respect of what is being proposed here, the process will be a gradual one. Those hon. members apparently do not understand this. A start cannot be made with the removal of these Bantu before the measure has not first been approved by both Houses of Parliament. The gradualness of the removal of those Bantu lies in the fact that, whereas they are now dispersed over the entire Reserve, they will first be drawn together into one spot. Had hon. members been familiar with the local circumstances, they would have known that at most there are 1,000 labour units in the total Bantu population. As a result of the development already in progress, all those labour units have been assimilated. They are already working there. The extensions to the harbour have not even been started yet. When the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) is making a plea on the grounds of the agricultural basis of their previous existence, he must realize that while they were previously agricultural people, they will now become industrial people. The hon. member must understand this.</p>

<p>I would have come to that point, but I shall now deal with it immediately. Negotiations had been taking place for a long time between the Bantu Commissioner at Empangeni and these people. Nothing is being done against the wishes of these people. The hon. member is shaking his head.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member should rather confine himself to his affairs in Pietermaritzburg (District). In every possible newspaper that hon. member does his utmost to set himself up as the authority and expert on conditions in Zululand&#x2014;one of these days he may possibly do so in the Friday <i>Times</i> as well. If the hon. member has the time one day he must really come along so that I can point out the deeper-lying facets of the region to him. He is no authority on Zululand. The hon. member must please not pretend to be one.</p>

<p>It is said that the Bantu areas in those regions are full. The point I have already made is, firstly, that we are going to have a shift from agricultural people to industrial people. This is the first important point. But there is other State land in that area. I am now referring particularly to the Mfuli area. The Government is busy settling people here. There is still a great deal of available space for those who want to practise agriculture. As far as that is concerned there is nothing to fear.</p>

<p>I want to correct another blunder. If hon. members had looked at the sketch accompanying the memorandum concerned, they would have noticed that the western boundary of the compensatory land, which is now becoming a Bantu area, borders on the Pongola River. That hon. member now wants to make the House believe that this is a poor type of land and that it is not irrigable. The banks of the Pongola River are pre-eminently those stretches of land which are going to come under irrigation from the J. G. Strydom Dam. If the hon. member wants to go and drive around with me on the plains one day, I would gladly go and point out the A1 and A2 or the B1 and B2 types of land to him. This ground is indeed irrigable and it is not sandy. If the agricultural value of the land being given here in exchange is taken into consideration, I would sooner think that too much compensatory land was given.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now come to the last point dealt with by the hon. member for Transkei. It is an argument that the Opposition frequently seizes upon, i.e. the question of our country&#x2019;s borders which are becoming Bantu areas. The hon. member for Klip River has already pointed out that the addition of more or less 12 miles to the Bantu area in the north, up against the Portuguese border, is not actually important because Reserve No. 14 already borders on Portuguese territory. There is also Reserve No. 16 which is already a Bantu area. In how many other areas in South Africa does a Bantu area not border on another international state? For example, the whole of the Tswana area borders on another country.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<p>That is why we are against your policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that when necessary the South African forces will enter that area for the defence of the country. They will enter the area and do their work there for the defence of the country, as, in fact, we already have to do in Reserve No. 14 and No. 6. Actually the argument holds no water and I think we must reduce this matter to its basic principles and then come to the conclusion that this measure will probably not be supported by the Opposition because it is very clear to them that it forms part of the implementation of our policy. This is precisely what they do not want to support. There is little else to be said against this measure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to-day we once more had the strange phenomenon of the hon. the Opposition coming along here and saying that they support the excision of Reserve No. 6 for various reasons, but, at the same time, that they have objections to it. Three objections were levelled against it. The hon. member for Klip River has already replied to two of these objections. One of the objections was that there would now be an additional 12 miles of international border under Bantu Control. The hon. member for Transkei says that we have increased the portion of the international border under Bantu control, i.e. that of Reserve No. 14. He is, of course, speaking about the area from Oro Point in a westerly direction up to the State land. He says that the Ndumu Game Reserve will then form the border. However, I doubt whether the hon. member will ever get there. One must be able to hold one&#x2019;s own if one wants to go driving around there. I have already done so. I do not think he will get there, but, if he cannot manage to do so, let him simply consult a map. I invite him to come to my Office and there he can see that Reserve No. 16, which just lies to the west, is identical. Then the hon. member could also give some thought to how Swaziland borders on Mozambique. But since when has Mozambique become a terrible danger? Let the hon. member also take a look at our northern border and there he will see how a large portion of our territory borders on Angola. It is simply a lot of nonsense to come along here now and to make so much of a fuss about an additional 12 miles of border.</p>

<p>The second point that was raised here, and to which my hon. colleague also replied, is the question of whether the Bantu were consulted. <span class="col_1563-1564" refersTo="page_0795"/>While replying to this question I also just want to reply to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District), who acts as if he is such a great expert on the Bantu. He wants &#x201C;fair play&#x201D; in respect of the Bantu. In Act No. 18 of 1936 provision was already made by the legislators, because they knew that this kind of exchange would rear its head. The Act made provision for parts that were scheduled or released, to be exchanged or interchanged. In this case valuations were made. The Bantu were consulted, and I just want to say that not all the Bantu in Reserve No. 6 will trek away to live in the compensatory area. Some of those Bantu are just as anxious for Richard&#x2019;s Bay to be developed as the Whites are. The Zulu people, for the greater part, are going to benefit by the development of Richard&#x2019;s Bay. The Bantu will actually benefit as much as the Whites from the development of Richard&#x2019;s Bay. Knowing that there is going to be development at Richard&#x2019;s Bay, the Bantu of Reserve No. 6 want to be near the development when it begins to take place. The chairman of the Bantu Affairs Committee rightly said here that the people, who had moved temporarily and who say that they know that Reserve No. 6 is necessary in the planning of Richard&#x2019;s Bay and for the industrial development which must take place there, can be given the assurance that one township will shortly be under construction. I speak of townships under construction, because in my opinion a construction of a town is never completed. For example, the construction of Cape Town is surely not complete yet, and therefore it is also still under construction. The people can surely go to Ngwelezana, which is under construction in Reserve No. 7B. In Reserve No. 5 Mseleni is under construction. The hon. members opposite know that the planning of the maximum development at Richard&#x2019;s Bay also includes a large Bantu township in Reserve No. 10.</p>

<p>In No. 10?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in Reserve No. 10. The hon. member must wait for the information and not simply draw his own conclusions. These people are still going to work in that area. Why, then, can they not be taken there? It is a fact that we cannot provide immediate accommodation for them, but they are surely not going to be moved to Reserve No. 6 immediately. Only the legal steps are now being taken in that connection, as is required of us in terms of Act No. 18 of 1936. In Act No. 18 of 1936 it is provided that we should give compensatory land wherever we expropriate land. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) also asked whether the Minister of Agriculture had been consulted. All of a sudden he is now very concerned about that. Does the hon. member now think that this department would go along and excise State land on behalf of the Bantu Trust without the permission of the Minister of Agriculture? My Minister would no more give permission for such a thing to be done than the Minister of Agriculture would allow Trust land to be excised without his permission. It is a measure that has been agreed upon. To ensure that we comply with the leal requirements of Act No. 18 of 1936, the valuation of the land was also done by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. This now automatically brings me to the hon. member who wanted to create a smoke screen here this morning by saying that the Bantu of reserve No. 6 were being tricked and that he wanted to see &#x201C;fair play&#x201D;. He said that he knew that that soil was all sandy, but I can tell him that I know that that soil is not all sandy.I have, in fact, been there and I have good reason to wonder whether he ever has. I shall now give the hon. member the valuation. This valuation was made by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. Does the hon. member have confidence in them? Does the hon. member have confidence in the valuations of the Land Tenure Board? When I have to make offers, and I am frequently criticized about those offers, I am dependent upon the valuations of the Land Tenure Board. According to their valuation there is 1,038 morgen of good irrigable land in that area which has already been valued. In this same list I am in-formed that this land is being valued cheaply. However, hon. members must remember that we are coming to a basis upon which the valuations of the two areas are virtually equal. They value it here at R300 per morgen, but they say that it would easily be worth R600 per morgen; but the canals have not yet been completed and the deforestation has not yet been done, and therefore it is only being valued at R300 per morgen. And who is going to build those canals and do that deforestation? Do you see how these people are being benefitted by the receipt of 1,038 morgen of land under the Josini Dam, land they do not have in Reserve No. 6 at all? According to the valuation I have here for Reserve No. 6, it is good forestry land, but here they are obtaining 1,038 morgen of good irrigable land, and then another 772 morgen of irrigable land, poorer in quality than the other. Then there is another 763 morgen of irrigable land, and this is probably what the hon. member was speaking about, but he forgets about the other 1,800 morgen of land. But one would have to place these 763 morgen under spray irrigation be-cause, as a result of its sandiness, one cannot apply gravitational irrigation. The hon. member is on that Select Committee, I am not. Why did he not take the opportunity of gleaning this information and of asking about the valuations? No, hon. members on the other side are afraid to say that they are opposed to the excision of Reserve No. 6. They now want to pretend that they are also in favour of it because they know that the development of Richard&#x2019;s Bay cannot he planned for and continued with if possession of the entire area is not obtained, as the Planning Committee has already recommended. But then they come forward with the argument that there is something <span class="col_1565-1566" refersTo="page_0796"/>wrong with the compensatory land that is being given. Sir, my department could have allocated compensatory land in any other place in Natal and it would not have been the right land either, because they are essentially opposed to the consolidation of Bantu areas and the implementation of Government policy.</p>

<p>I welcome this report of the Committee and I want to tell you that the Ministery supports it in full, and we ask both Houses of Parliament to accept it as such.</p>

<heading>BANTU LAWS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage resumed)</summary>

<p>Clause 7 (contd.):</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 7 amends section 18 of the Urban Areas Act. I just want to ask the Minister a question or two in regard to the effect of this amendment. As I see it, the effect is that where alternative accommodation is to be provided as a result of a Bantu township being declared unhealthy or unfit for habitation, the alternative accommodation need not necessarily be in the area under the control of the urban authority concerned. It appears to me that this amendment very radically affects the section 10 rights of the residents of those Bantu townships. I understood the Minister to say that he does not intend to take away the rights conferred by section 10. but it seems to me that he will have a situation in some of these Bantu townships where they become unhealthy or unfit for habitation as a result, possibly, of neglect by the urban authority concerned. It may also be that the urban authority has difficulty in raising the finance required to rebuild the township, and so the residents of the township find themselves in the position that they are penalized and possibly moved to another area not as the result of any default of their own. I think that somehow or other the Minister should reconsider the matter to protect these rights, and I also think the hon. the Minister would make it clearer to us if he quotes a couple of examples of where this might well happen. He has spoken about the removal of Bantu from Windhoek and Harrismith, but are there any other villages where he contemplates a similar state of affairs arising?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The position in regard to clause 7 is just this, that where a medical Officer condemns a Bantu house it is being provided here that the Minister can order that adequate accommodation is not necessarily granted only in that prescribed area where the house has been condemned. but that it can also be in a Bantu homeland, that is all. This clause has nothing to do with the removal of a Bantu town, or any other type of case. It deals solely with the case of a medical Officer condemning a house. I want to say at once that very few cases like this occur where Bantu houses are condemned by a medical Officer for health reasons. Therefore I am quite unable to share the view of the Opposition in this regard that section 10 is involved here. This was what I was explaining to the hon. members when the House adjourned yesterday evening, and I do not think I need cover that ground again. Suffice it to say that it is not the intention here to involve Section 10 cases. In any event, the cases which occur where medical Officers are compelled to condemn houses for health reasons, are few and far between, and therefore I do not think that the dangers which the hon. member for Walmer who has just spoken sees in this clause, exist.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Last night I put questions to the hon. the Deputy Minister and I think, with your leave, Sir, I should remind him that he did not answer the questions. I asked about the responsibility of providing accommodation and why now, when it was not the responsibility of the Bantu people themselves to provide suitable accommodation when these Bantu find themselves in the position, through no fault of their own, of having to live in houses which have been condemned by the medical Officer of health, they should now be removed from the urban area. I want to react further to the statement the hon. the Deputy Minister has just made now that we must accept that this provision, if it is applied, will not affect the rights of those people who qualify under section 10. I want to disagree with the Deputy Minister entirely on that, and I want to refer him to section 10. Section 10 (1) lays down that no Bantu shall remain for more than 72 hours in a prescribed area. This gives the Bantu the right to remain if he qualifies under certain conditions and subsection (b) refers to the Bantu who has worked continuously in such area for one employer for a period of not less than 10 years, or has lawfully resided continuously in such area for a period of not less than 15 years and has thereafter continued to reside in such an area. Now, he does not provide his own house. The house is provided by the local authority. Due to the dilatoriness of the local authority, or due to the fact that the Minister of Community Development and the National Housing Commission will not make funds available, that house falls into disrepair and it is condemned by the medical Officer of health. In terms of this provision, the Minister can remove that Bantu from the urban area and compel him to live in some other township outside of the area of jurisdiction of that local authority, in which case his rights under section 10 are lost. That is why the hon. member for Transkei, accepting the <i>bona tides</i> of the Deputy Minister. has moved this amendment to protect those particular people to whom I am referring now. I want to make it clear to this Committee that we are not only worried about <span class="col_1567-1568" refersTo="page_0797"/>those persons who have rights under section 10; we are also worried about all the law-abiding Bantu residing in these townships. But it is apparent that this Government intends to push this through and it is apparent that the main object behind all this is the removal of the Bantu from the white areas, and because of that we are powerless to defend those who do not have the right, but provision does exist in the legislation for the protection of those who qualify under section 10. Once again I want to ask the Deputy Minister to accept this amendment. Let us at least protect those people and let us show the Bantu people of this country that the Whites at least have some charity towards them.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p></p>

<p>I want to point out again that this clause relates only to houses which are condemned by a medical Officer. From the nature of the case, scheme houses, in other words, houses built by the local authorities, do not fall under this at all, for of course there is a fund, called the maintenance fund, which the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) ought to know about, for those scheme houses. This type of case therefore does not occur at all, and if he now wants to accept my word that it occurs very rarely that a medical Officer is compelled to condemn a house, it would not be necessary for me to explain further, for the only type of house which is involved here is the self-built house. To reply now to the question he put to me, as to who supplies that house, I have already replied to him by implication. Where it is in a prescribed area the local authority provides the House. If the House is in a Bantu homeland Bantu Trust supplies the house and then my Department is involved. That is therefore the reply to that. Lastly I want to return to the question the hon. member has once again asked in regard to section 10, the position is simply this, that if such a Bantu whose house has been condemned by a medical Officer is employed, properly and legally registered in employment, then there are four possibilities open to such a Bantu if his house should be condemned by a medical Officer. Now, you must remember that this category is already a very minor one, because this is merely a self-built house. There are four possibilities open to him if he is therefore in registered employment. The first is that he can go and live in a hostel, and then the local authority is the body which effects this.</p>

<p>If he has a family there, other adequate accommodation can be made available to him by the local authority if he is in legally registered employment. That is the second possibility. The third possibility is that such a Bantu can take lodgings, and the fourth possibility is that the local authority can allocate an erf to him and a house can be built for him there. Those are the four possibilities if he is working.</p>

<p>Under the ordinary location regulations, the position under the ordinary location regulations is this, and this is the reply to that, and there is no other reply to it, because these are the facts. This deals with Bantu if they are employed, and surely I have now indicated to the hon. member and to the Opposition that in this category, as far as my Department and I can judge, section 10 is not in any way involved. Now we are left with one type of case, and that is the Bantu who is not working and whose house has now been condemned by a medical Officer. I want to ask the Opposition whether they are arguing that a Bantu who is not in service and whose house has been condemned by the medical Officer for health reasons must under all circumstances simply be offered adequate accommodation in that prescribed area. This is all we are doing in this clause and this is all that this clause provides. In cases of that nature, which of course&#x2014;I want to amplify this again&#x2014;will occur very infrequently and which occur infrequently in practice, in other words, the case of a Bantu who is not working there and who can in any case be picked up under Section 29 of the Urban Areas Act if he on the other hand is an undesirable person, or under section 14 of the Urban Areas Act. what is wrong with inserting a clause here which provides that he should not necessarily be offered adequate accommodation in the prescribed area, but that he can be offered, at discretion, adequate accommodation in a Bantu homeland.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I object to this clause. During the second-reading debate I mentioned the reasons for my objection and I should like to repeat them to the Committee now. Sir, as I understand it, the Urban Areas Act provides that an urban local authority&#x2019;s Bantu beer account shall be chargeable only with the costs incurred in the manufacture of the beer and, secondly, any service, expenditure or grant which may be certified in writing by the Minister as being calculated to improve the social or recreational amenities available, to the Bantu residents within the area of the urban local authority, or otherwise to promote the social welfare of such residents. That is how I read the existing provision of the Act.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the balance of the unused profits can be expended to subsidize housing or any service or expenditure or grant certified in writing by the Minister as being in the interests of the Bantu, irrespective of Whether or not it relates to that urban authority because that amount has gone into the General Municipal Bantu Revenue Account; so two-thirds of that amount can be expended on housing, etc., if the hon. the Minister approves of the expenditure. There was an amendment introduced in 1964, I think, whereby that expenditure does not have to apply only to the urban areas but can also be used to subsidize amenities, etc., in the homelands.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says: &#x201C;So far so good.&#x201D; Now here is the rub. Sir: What does the hon. the Minister propose now? In his White Paper he has given us one of his usual, what I call, smooth explanations. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proposed amendment gives the Minister wider powers in regard to the expenditure of funds in the Bantu Beer Account. The principle is already contained in section 19 of the Urban Areas Act as regards the two-thirds credit balance of the account mentioned, and it is now proposed to also include the other one-third of the account.</block>

<p>Well, that is all very well, but, of course, much wider powers are now being taken in regard to the expenditure, because what it means, as I interpret this&#x2014;I may be wrong, but I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister will not hesitate to tell me if I am wrong&#x2014;is that any part of the unexpended profits which used to be reserved for use only in the local area concerned, can. at the discretion of the Minister, be expended on the homelands. In other words, he is taking charge of the lot except for the cost of producing the beer. In other words, he is grabbing the lot. He is not allowing part of it to be used only and exclusively in the urban areas concerned; he wants to be able to debit to the Bantu Beer Account any expenditure incurred in the homelands for housing, recreational facilities and better social amenities. So far we are on common ground.</p>

<p>No, I do not think I am. The explanation he gave us in the second-reading debate was that this was only fair and just because after all who were the consumers of Bantu beer in the urban areas but the migratory workers who came in from the homelands.

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>One could carry this argument to its logical conclusion. Does the <span class="col_1571-1572" refersTo="page_0799"/>hon. member who is asking me this question realize that of the African mineworkers and the Africans in the municipal areas, who are large consumers of beer, more than 50 per cent come from outside South Africa? If one carries this argument to its logical conclusion, some of the money should be sent to Lesotho, Swaziland, Rhodesia or Portuguese East Africa, or to any country from which our foreign mineworkers come. That is therefore not a very sound argument. What worries me in any case is that the migratory workers who buy their beer in the urban areas, spend 11 / 12ths of their working lives inside the urban areas anyway. Therefore that is where most of the money should be expended. I may say that we are not dealing with pin-money in this regard.</p>

<p>I shall be told very quickly if I am wrong, but my information is that the sales are reaching the neighbourhood of R1 million a week in Soweto. That is what is being realized on the sale of beer. That is a very considerable amount. If we now give the hon. the Minister the power to take as much as he likes from the urban local authorities and then spend that money on recreational and housing facilities in the rural area, the townships are going to be left with very little, bearing in mind the official policy of the Government. This is the important thing. We must remember that their policy is that as many people as possible should be returned to their homelands, so I see this money being spent on housing in the resettlement areas in the reserves. Already the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, the present Minister of Community Development, spoke about it being wrong to provide the urban African with luxuries. I think his words were: &#x201C;We must not spoil them.&#x201D; When one sees the facilities these people have, one realizes that they are the bare minimum.</p>

<p>Yes, he did. He said that it was quite wrong to spoil them and provide them with luxuries. I shall fish out the exact reference for the hon. member if he wants me to. I am not wrong. This matter was raised last year, and I am raising it again now. I know perfectly well that the hon. the Minister will be grabbing as much as he can of the beer profits and as little as possible will be spent in the urban areas where that money is in fact gleaned, and as much as possible will be spent in the rural areas. For all these reasons I am dead against this reallocation of the profits on the sale of beer. The Deputy Minister is now appropriating part of the additional one-third of the profits for himself in terms of this clause, and I therefore intend to vote against it.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Houghton started off by giving a very fine exposition of the various aspects of this matter, but then she started misunderstanding things and went off the rails. That is the point at which I shall start. All that is concerned here is surpluses in the beer account. As hon. members know, there is a two-thirds beer account and a one-third beer account. The two-thirds beer account remains absolutely unchanged. It is still statutorily guaranteed, as is set out in section 2 (c). That position remains the same. In terms of this section, as paragraph (c) reads, the position under the present circumstances is that, if a local authority has a surplus in its two-thirds beer account, that local authority can, if it wishes, donate a part of its surplus to the Bantu Trust so that that money can be used for the development of the homelands. In terms of the present position, a local authority cannot use the surplus, should there in fact be a surplus in the one-third beer account, for any other purpose at all than that provided for in the Act. In other words, if a local authority has a large surplus in its one-third beer account, it cannot, in terms of the present provisions of the Act, use that money for productive purposes or as a gift to the Bantu Trust for the development of the Bantu homelands. All we are doing now, is to create the necessary statutory measures so that a local authority which has a surplus in its one-third beer account, may, after applying it to the purposes in its area to which it may be applied, make a donation to the Bantu Trust, in the same way as it can already do in the case of the two-thirds beer account. We are therefore merely enabling a local authority to make such a donation if it wishes to do so. Nothing more is envisaged in this regard. I am not trying to be smooth. I am trying to state a fact. Nothing more is involved in this.</p>

<p>Sir, if I have explained this properly, I have already said that this only concerns surpluses in the one-third beer account. But a number of other important facts follow from this. The first important fact following from this is that the initiative for the donation to the Bantu Trust comes from the local authority. It would only come if there is a surplus in the one-third beer account. It cannot come in any other way. We are not going to grab that money.</p>

<p>We are not going to take it either. Those moneys will come to us on the initiative of a local council, if such a local council wishes to grant the money, this can only happen in the event of such a local council having a surplus in its one-third beer account. That is all there is to it. Anybody who reads anything more into this provision, is definitely completely off the rails. I can assure hon. members of that.</p>

<p>There is one last point I wish to make. It is obvious that my department does not wish to assist local councils to spend unnecessary funds on social luxuries in the European areas. The <span class="col_1573-1574" refersTo="page_0800"/>hon. member is quite correct. In terms of our policy, that is so. This is so not because we are unfair, but because those luxuries should properly be provided in the Bantu homelands. That is the point I was trying to make in my second-reading speech.

<p>Yes, but I submit that the White Paper puts the position more correctly than the Minister does. The White Paper says that the proposed amendment gives the Minister wider powers with regard to the expenditure of funds in the Bantu beer account. Why did the White Paper not say that this is to enable municipalities to make donations to the reserves for social developments. This is in fact what is going to happen: The Minister will refuse the council permission to build &#x201C;social luxuries&#x201D;, as he puts it, and then there will of course be a surplus in the fund. The Minister will then merely take that surplus. The Deputy Minister says that they will take the surplus in the one-third beer account.</p>

There will be surpluses and what will happen to that money? The hon. the Minister is not merely going to allow it to lie there.

<p>Now they are unnecessary. When the hon. the Deputy Minister spoke he used the same tone and the same language as his predecessor, the present Minister of Community Development. The reason he gave then was that the reserves should be made more attractive. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister says that he agrees that the reserves should be made more attractive. Why, he asks, should they therefore have luxuries in the townships? But what about the Bantu who are permanently resident in the townships? Why should they also not have luxuries? What about all those people who are protected by section 10? Why should they not have luxuries? Why should it only be the Bantu in the reserves who can have luxuries? If the hon. the Minister wants to give luxuries to the Bantu in the reserves, why do they not develop the reserves so that there will be money to be spent in the reserves for luxuries there? Why not give the Bantu who are living in the urban areas and working there, who are getting a service from the municipalities and from their particular locations, luxuries to enjoy while they are working there? They are spending their money there. Why should they not have swimming baths, to which the hon. the Deputy Minister objects?</p>

<p>That is quite correct. But this is a responsible Government which is supported by responsible officials. They are not a lot of children who waste their Saturday morning pocket-money. That is the position. These hon. members only want to retain the money for the urban Bantu because they are as scared of section 10 as can be. In the case of every clause section 10 is dragged in. Why do hon. members not take a wider view in these matters? Surely they know what happens in the urban areas. They see which sports fields are being developed there. They see the theatres and the libraries. They see the transport services there. They see all the services there. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Houghton knows these things very well. But where must the unproductive Bantu of these areas be cared for? Where must the urban Bantu get holiday amenities? In case you are not aware of it, Sir, I want to point out that the urban Bantu are asking for holiday resorts in the Bantu homelands. This is only one undertaking for which this money can be used, namely the development of holiday resorts in the Bantu homelands. The urban Bantu are also asking for something else. They ask: &#x201C;Provide housing for us in our own areas where, for example, our aged can be settled&#x201D;. Municipalities are keen to make donations, amongst other things also for this kind of development in these areas. The urban Bantu ask us: &#x201C;Help us to establish our towns which are here, in our homelands&#x201D;. In case those hon. members who come from Johannesburg and other urban areas are not aware of it, I just want to tell those hon. members that I myself have had discussions with the leaders of urban Bantu. They asked for this and said: &#x201C;Help us to transfer this town of ours to our own territory. Help us with transport services in that territory&#x201D;. This does not mean that the hon. the Minister is now going to take all this money and spend it there, but there are such fine things which can be done for the development and uplifting of these under-developed peoples. In spite of this, the hon. members on the other side want to leave these surpluses lying unproductively, because how much money do we need to spend on luxuries? If one has a surplus of R1 million, one cannot spend it just for the sake of spending it. This is what the argument of the hon. members on that side amounts to. I really think that we should take it amiss of the hon. members that they adopt such a negative attitude while we are dealing with an important matter here, namely the uplifting of these under-developed peoples who are not settled in urban areas only. The interests of the urban Bantu are just as much in the homelands, because they have direct links with their homelands.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. the Deputy Minister knows, I quarrel with the remarks he has made. In the first place, I wonder why there should be a surplus at all in any of these municipal accounts. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister has paid a visit to some of these municipalities. These people are not merely short of luxuries, but short also of some of the basic necessities of life. Let me mention a few of them. I do not know whether schools, for instance, would fall under something which would promote the social welfare of such residents in terms of the definition in the Act, but if they do not they certainly should. If any amendment should be introduced, it should be one to include schools among the needed social amenities or anything which contributes to their social welfare. One has only to go into a Bantu township at the beginning of the school year to see the thousands of children that are turned away from the doors of the most inadequate schools in the country. This is just a little suggestion I wish to make. The existing schools are all woefully short of all basic equipment, such as desks. Their libraries are a disgrace except where private donors have contributed towards them. One could go on indefinitely giving examples. Let me mention the example of cr&#x00E8;ches for the children of working women. There are some creches run through public benevolence but they are desperately short of facilities, such as buildings, all the necessary equipment and money to pay for staff to look after the small children of the women who go out to augment the very low incomes of those families. There should not be a surplus of one penny lying in the municipal account. All that money which comes from the Africans themselves should be expended on these essential welfare services. I have mentioned only two such services but there are others I could mention, such as recreational and sports fields. Some of that money should be diverted to providing foot bridges at the stations so that there need not be the terrible accidents, seeing that the South African Railways seem unable to provide them. If anything is needed, it is an amendment to broaden the scope of the uses to which this money can be put. That is my first point. There are no unnecessary luxuries in the townships.</p>

<p>To talk about spending money in the European areas, which is the phrase the hon. the Deputy Minister used &#x2026; What does he mean by &#x201C;European areas&#x201D;? I know that Soweto <span class="col_1577-1578" refersTo="page_0802"/>technically speaking lies within the Johannesburg municipal area but can the hon. the Deputy Minister honestly say that that is a European area? Between 600,000 and 750,000 Africans live in that area. I may point out that that is nearly two and a half times the population of Lesotho.</p>

Since the hon. the Minister is busy swopping black spots all over the place, he should swop this very large black spot and he would get out of a lot of his difficulties.

He never reads a Bill and he never knows what he is voting on. I am therefore not going to waste my time arguing with him. I want to come back to this other point. The hon. the Deputy Minister has said that the municipalities are dying to spend these surpluses on facilities in the homelands. Some of the municipalities over which he may have some influence, no doubt, by gentle persuasion have already made their donations. I wonder what he uses for gentle persuasion and what he promises them in exchange if they only add to the coffers that he is building up in this respect. He is very proud about it. One remembers that in the no-confidence debate he gave us a long list of the donations that have been given to him by the municipalities for expenditure in the reserves. He wants to add to that. He wants to be able to come to this House next session and say to a11 of us &#x201C;Look at the millions that I now have!&#x201D; Donations, my eye, Sir! I wonder what he says to those municipalities when he makes them hand over their shekels so willingly. I should like to know what this gentle persuasion is.</p>

<p>I say that there are no unnecessary luxuries in the townships. I do not think hon. members ever set foot in a township. It would do them the world of good to do so. If anything, the scope of expenditure of the one third unused profits&#x2014;and there should not be any unused profits&#x2014;should be widened so as to include amenities such as schools. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister can tell me whether he objects to the money which is to be spent on schools?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Transkei said that this clause gives wider powers to the Minister. This is quite correct, as the White Paper also states. But the question to be asked is what those wider powers are. As I have explained, it simply means that, if there is a surplus in the one-third beer account and a municipality wants to donate some of that surplus to the Trust, they will now be given the opportunity to do so, while in terms of the existing legislation they are not able to do so. These are the wide powers, and there are no others.</p>

<p>I have also been asked &#x201C;What are luxuries?&#x201D; I do not intend to try to give a definition here about what constitutes &#x201C;luxuries&#x201D; and what does not, but, as the hon. member for Potchefstroom indicated, hon. members may even go to visit the Bantu townships in the white areas. Then they will see that, where there are profits in the one-third beer account, trouble is really taken to satisfy the needs of those people. That hon. member is quite correct. There are libraries, sportsfields, swimming baths, etc. These are regarded as essential facilities which must be provided there. Surely this is only fair. But if a municipality wants to build a five-storey house, I would very definitely regard it as a luxury.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>If certain basic, uniform costs in connection with the provision of housing are exceeded, then I would say that it becomes a luxury while there is a great need for houses. This is the position for the simple reason that, in terms of our policy on this side of the House, a Bantu who is in a white area is still there as a visitor who has come to work there, as a person who is there in a temporary capacity. His home and the place where he should have all his civil rights and all his other rights, is in his own homeland. That is our policy. Those hon. members differ with us, as does the hon. member for Houghton. It is a basic difference <span class="col_1579-1580" refersTo="page_0803"/>and nothing which I shall say from this side will convince those hon. members of this standpoint, because their standpoint is directly opposed to our standpoint that a Bantu in the white area is only working here temporarily. Therefore he is entitled to only a fair <i>modus vivendi</i> here. I think the <i>modus vivendi</i> we provide is a very fair one. The local authorities do their utmost to provide it as fairly as possible. This clause is not at all intended, and no further attempt is being made at all, to withhold that basic, fair <i>modus vivendi</i> from any Bantu. All we are doing here, is to create a channel through which surpluses can be applied in the homelands.</p>

<p>As far as the schools are concerned, the same argument applies. I honestly do not think it is quite relevant to this clause, but I promised that I would reply to it and I want to do so now. By means of a separate Bantu education account, we are trying to establish the necessary school facilities for the Bantu throughout the Republic of South Africa. We have made excellent progress in this regard. But our policy in regard to this matter is that in the first place the accent must fall on the Bantu homelands. Therefore I do not think it is relevant here to ask whether this profit will be used for that purpose. In certain cases it can and is in fact being done, but what is primarily involved here, is not the provision of school facilities from the one-third and two-thirds beer accounts.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we asked the Deputy Minister to tell us what these luxuries were that he objected to. What did he say is the luxury he objects to? A five-storey house. Now who is going to build a five-storey house? One cannot build it in terms of section 19 as it now stands, which reads &#x201C;calculated to improve the social or recreational amenities&#x201D;. How can a five-storey house be a recreational amenity for the Bantu? The Minister still has not told us what these luxuries are to which he objects.

<p>Mr. Chairman, previous legislators in this House in their wisdom provided that one-third of the excess profits on the Bantu Beer Account must be used for the amenities for the Bantu resident within the area of the local authority. They did this in their wisdom. They did it with a reason. The object was to keep those people happy. I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that to-day the situation is unchanged from what it was then.

I am sure that the hon. the Deputy Minister is prepared to concede the point that I have made, but he now speaks about &#x201C;unnecessary luxuries&#x201D;. He cannot tell us what unnecessary luxuries are. I want to ask him, is there any place in South Africa where he can point out any such unnecessary luxuries? Is there any local authority in South Africa who has not spent all the money which it has been allowed to spend on the provision of amenities for these people?

<p>Clause 7 (contd.):</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when this Committee adjourned for the lunch interval I was asking the hon. the Minister or the hon. the Deputy Minister if they can tell us of any instances or if they will advise this Committee whether they have at any time refused to give a local authority permission to spend that one-third of the balance of the beer profits, which is set aside for that purpose, on the provision of amenities within the area of jurisdiction of such a local authority. I am asking that particularly in the light of comments made by the hon. member for Potchefstroom where he asked the question: Why let the money lie idle in the coffers of the local authority? I want to put it to that hon. member that if the hon. the Minister took a realistic attitude and if he was not so hide-bound by the ideology of this Nationalist Party which considers these people to be temporary sojourners in the so-called white South Africa, there will be no need for any money to lie idle in the coffers of any of these local authorities. If the hon. the Deputy Minister will allow local authorities to spend this money on necessities, and as the law stands to-day, on &#x201C;social and recreational facilities,&#x201D; and I would like to add schools because I am sure they will be covered by this definition, this money will not lie idle. The hon. member for Stilfontein has been interjecting right through this debate and said that these people have no rights and that they are only here temporarily. I am serious because I feel it is pertinent to this particular debate, when I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if he can tell us whether he, the hon. the Minister or the department, has at any time refused permission to any local authority to expend money in this way.</p>

<p><span class="col_1581-1582" refersTo="page_0805"/>The hon. member for Potchefstroom said that he felt this money should be used for the development of holiday resorts. He pointed out that these holiday resorts should not be in what he calls white South Africa, but that they should be in what he calls the homelands. I will agree that the development of holiday facilities for all the Bantu peoples is an urgent necessity, and I want to agree that they should be developed. But I have said before in this House, and I want to say it again, that if the development of these holiday resorts, and particularly at Umgababa on the South Coast was turned over to private enterprise amongst the Bantu people, we would get somewhere. If all the money that this Government has collected, and all the money it has collected from donations for the development of just such a project as Umgababa, is taken into account, I want to ask what they had done. At Umgababa there is nothing. I think there are only five holiday cottages that have been established there. Some have been established in the disused buildings of a mining enterprise, but this Government has done nothing. If one looks at the report of the Controller and Auditor-General one sees that donations from local authorities made to the department totalled R281,400 in the year 1967-&#x2019;68. When one also sees how much of it this hon. Minister has spent, one realizes that it is no good making these donations because the Government is not spending it any way.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member has asked me whether we have at any time refused to allow a local authority to spend one-third of the amount of its profit account. The reply to that question is that as far as we know, permission has not been refused in one single case. I am grateful that the hon. member put this question to me. It gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to local authorities for the exceptional sense of responsibility they display as regards these matters, and one is highly appreciative of and pays tribute to the manner in which they are doing it.</p>

<p>I now want to make a most important point, in my humble opinion, which is directly concerned with this question. In saying this, I think I am dealing with the fundamental reason why this clause is contained in the Bill. We have here in the Cape Province divisional councils which have one-third profits at their disposal but which do not have any Bantu villages or locations. They have that money at their disposal while they are not in a position to use it. I do not want to mention the names of such places if it is not necessary, but I have in mind divisional councils with, for example, contract workers. There is no location there, but beer is sold to those people. There is, therefore, a one-third profit account and, as the Act reads at present, they cannot use the one-third profit in that area at all because the law does not make any provision for them to use that money.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 11:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister will know that our main objection to this Bill is the provisions of this particular clause. As we have stated during the second-reading debate, and also in the motion to resume the debate on this Bill this Session, we object to the dictatorial powers which are being given to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The hon. the Minister can, through these powers, control not only the lives of Bantu throughout the country, but also the future of all other races, for example, our industrialists and in fact our whole economy. The powers that we propose to give the hon. the Minister in this clause will enable him to control the whole future economy of South Africa. The hon. the Minister has quite blatantly told us that the objective of this clause is to stop integration; to stop work flowing from white hands into black hands. He said the object of this Bill was to prevent that. We point out that there are other Ministers who have powers to control this. The hon. the Minister of Labour by means of job reservation can stop work going from white hands to black hands. That is the whole object of giving that hon. Minister his powers under the Industrial Conciliation Act. In that Act the hon. the Minister of Labour has powers to reserve occupations for certain racial groups. The reason given then was to stop work flowing from white hands to black hands. Where we questioned why this hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development had now taken over this task, we asked if he had lost all confidence in the hon. the Minister of Labour. I see <span class="col_1583-1584" refersTo="page_0806"/>that the hon. the Minister has now, in reply, put an amendment on the Order Paper which has not yet been moved, but which I take it will be moved. This amendment will oblige the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to consult with the hon. the Minister of Labour before he advertises a restriction of employment regarding the Bantu. I want to know why it is necessary in this clause to insert that the hon. the Minister must consult. Was he not going to consult in any event with the hon. the Minister of Labour? Why, if he is going to consult with the hon. the Minister of Labour, can he not leave it to the hon. the Minister of Labour to handle the matter, because after all it is a labour matter? We know why it is. The simple reason is that before the hon. the Minister of Labour can reserve any work an industrial tribunal has to investigate the matter at a public hearing. They can hear evidence from the interested parties and only after all that, can the tribunal make recommendations to the hon. the Minister of Labour.</p>

<p>In terms of this Bill which we are now considering, the Minister of Bantu Administration of course can act on his own. He does not have to have any enquiry, he does not have to consult any of the interested parties, he can merely on his own by publishing in the <i>Government Gazette</i> limit the work of a Bantu, not only to special types of work, but also in specified areas or to specified employers. I know the hon. the Minister will say that another amendment will be moved later allowing the Minister to amend any such notice. He can amend it and exempt certain employers from the operations of his notice. This is again government by exemption. This Nationalist Government keeps on passing laws to show that it is carrying out the policy of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; in restricting the Africans from doing certain work or from being in certain places. What does it do then? It then grants exemptions. In this case by merely giving the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development these powers, we are bringing general uncertainty into the lives of all Bantu. Every African, whether he has been born in that area or whether he has acquired rights under section 10 or not, will not know what his position is from the time this Bill is passed. He will never know when he will be stopped from doing his work, the work he has been taught to do, the work he has done all his life in an urban area. Industrialists and other entrepreneurs and employers will never know when they might be stopped from employing a Bantu. Not only a Bantu in a specified class of employment, but also a specified employer may find himself banned. I say that this is going far too far. No other Minister has asked for these far-reaching powers. Other Ministers have wanted powers and have taken them, but no other Minister has come forward with a Bill of this nature to give him such wide powers which will enable him to control the whole economic future of the country and the lives of every Bantu working outside the Reserves. Therefore we will oppose this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s amendment makes no difference whatever to the operation of this clause. He has to consult but then he need take no notice of the consultation. After that he is on his own. He has all the powers already mentioned by the hon. member for Transkei. They are powers that exceed the powers presently held by the hon. the Minister of Labour, because he at least has to have an enquiry and give reasons. They are also beyond the powers held by the hon. the Minister of Planning, because he also has to give the employers the opportunity of putting their case before him and cannot cancel existing contracts.</p>

<p>The real authors of this clause are not in the House to-day. The real authors of this clause sit here on the benches immediately to the right of me. I call this the Herstigte clause because that is what it is. It is only since certain members have complained that white women were being displaced in certain occupations which the hon, the Minister specifically mentioned in his Second Reading speech that indeed it has been necessary to inject this absurd type of job reservation into our laws. There have been complaints that African women have been serving behind counters, have been acting as clerks and typists in Offices and that these are displacing white women. Of course, there has been a question on the Order Paper this Session asking how many white women have been displaced. And the Government out-Hertzogs Hertzog in this case. Therefore it must go ahead with this sort of legislation so that from the week after next onwards it can rush around the countryside from platform to platform proclaiming that it is protecting white women. That is the whole objective of this ridiculous exercise that we are indulging in here to-day. One cannot get <span class="col_1585-1586" refersTo="page_0807"/>an answer from the hon. the Minister as to how many people have in fact been displaced by African women. How many white women have lost their jobs as a result of African women taking jobs as clerks, typists and shop assistants? In any case, is it not very likely that the sort of women who have taken these jobs are highly efficient, that they are doing good competent jobs and that they deserve to be left entirely where they are? I see no reason for legislation to protect inefficient white people. That is all that the Government is trying to do with this legislation. I say that the white women who can be employed in South Africa, who want to be employed in South Africa are employed in South Africa. There is no unemploment among white women in South Africa. The only people who do not get jobs are the ones who cannot get jobs because they are inefficient. For us to come in 1970 with this sort of legislation to protect inefficient white workers is the height of absurdity. That is the one point I wanted to make.</p>

<p>The other point is that this clause states that white occupations in white undertakings in white areas, etc., are to be reserved for white people. But the implication is, of course, that African women can get jobs in their own areas. I want to point out two aspects. The first is that there was a departmental circular a few years ago that was sent to local authorities and precluded the granting of licences for shops, etc., in the townships if the requirements of the Bantu, as the circular said, can reasonably be supplied in the adjacent white towns and cities. So the Department of Bantu Administration is not assisting African entrepreneurs to set up in the townships and thereby provide employment for African clerks or African shop assistants. Quite the contrary. It is blocking the further extension of African trade in the townships which, as I say, looks after hundreds and thousands of Africans who are living there on a permanent basis and who are not there on the temporary or migratory basis that the hon. members would like them to be.</p>

<p>The other point I wanted to make is in regard to the question of border industries. I understand that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, the present Minister of Community Development, stated some years ago that he intended to take steps to stop Whites from putting up shops in the border areas so that the people employed in the border areas would spend their money in shops in the Reserves. I want to know from this hon. Minister whether he followed up on this suggestion of his predecessor? Is it his intention to try and prevent the setting of shops in the border areas so that Africans would spend their money earned in the border areas in the Reserves? I, of course, do not treat this as a justification for the introduction of this clause. As far as I am concerned, this clause is absolute nonsense. In this day and age we should not be contemplating a further extension of a job reservation law which cannot be put into practice anyway. We have job reservation under section 77. The hon. the Minister said it requires too many inquiries and time-consuming investigations. That is why he is going ahead and introducing this clause. He wants it for specific occupations. He also wants to be able to apply it swiftly in any specific district. I want to point out to him that the wide powers given to the Minister of Labour under section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act cannot be applied. As we all know, blanket exemptions are given in practically every single occupation in South Africa for the simple reason that the white workers for whom those jobs are meant to be reserved, are just not available. The same position will apply here. The hon. the Minister will single out a number of shops which happen to be situated in a peculiar &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; stronghold. He will say that in such and such a shop in Benoni or Brakpan, white women only can serve behind counters. I know the hon. member for Brakpan is specially keen on this clause. The hon. the Minister will do this so that he can rush around Brakpan and say &#x201C;There you are, we saved white South Africa. We saved it from a fate worse than death. We have saved the Whites in South Africa from having to be served by competent black hands.&#x201D; This is an absurd clause. No matter what explanation the hon. the Minister has given in his White Paper and despite everything he had to say about this clause in the Second Reading debate, I certainly am going to object to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman I can quite understand that the hon. member for Houghton adopts the attitude she is adopting here now. As far as we are concerned, we understand her policy and we know what her policy is. The hon. member for Houghton makes no secret of the fact that the policy of the Progressive Party is an out and out one of integration. The hon. member for Houghton and her Party accept the fact that South Africa is a country for the approximately 20 million people who are living here. The hon. member makes no secret of it. We differ radically from her. What the hon. member for Houghton said here this afternoon, was not really meant for local consumption. It was meant for foreign consumption. That is no concern of mine. If the hon. member wants to serve her mother country in that way, she may as well carry on doing so. She and her Party have been doing this all along. The result of that was that we are held in contempt and mistrusted by the rest of the world. Something I fail to understand, is that the United Party is opposing this clause with all their might, as we have just heard from the hon. member for Transkei. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that the provisions of this clause would be applied in a just and fair manner and after consultations with the Minister of Labour. The hon. member for Transkei has now found fault with the fact that the Minister of Labour will be consulted. During his Second Reading speech the hon. the Deputy <span class="col_1587-1588" refersTo="page_0808"/>Minister said that this provision was supplementary to the Industrial Conciliation Act. The hon. member for Transkei knows full well that the administration of the Industrial Conciliation Act falls under the Minister of Labour. Since this provision is of a supplementary nature, it follows that consultations and discussions should take place with the Minister of Labour. I find this astounding and it surprises me that the United Party can blow hot and cold in this way.</p>

<p>I have here an article which appeared in <i>The Cape Times</i> this morning and which was written by Mr. Hamilton Russell. In this article he attacks the United Party candidate in Sea Point, Mr. Jack Basson. The slogan of this candidate in that constituency is: &#x201C;Keep Sea Point white&#x201D;. I agree one hundred pet cent with the attitude adopted by the United Party in this connection. What are we trying to do here? We want to go further. We do not merely want to keep Sea Point white. We want to keep the whole of white South Africa white. We want to reserve white South Africa for the white worker. I am sorry the hon. member for Sea Point is not in the House this afternoon. I said I would be discussing this matter. I want to know from the United Party and from the hon. member for Sea Point how they are going to succeed in keeping Sea Point white when they do not have the provisions and means contained in this specific clause? How are they going to keep Johannesburg white when they do not have this clause? One need only look at the shops in our major cities and in Sea Point to see in whose hands the distribution trade is to-day. It is in the hands of the non-Whites. This kind of thing is taking place on a reasonably large scale in the industrial areas in Johannesburg, Benoni and other parts of the country. This is why we need this provision. It is to stop this sort of thing from happening.</p>

<p>I want to mention a specific case to-day, that is the case of the United Party City Council in Johannesburg. Is the United Party taking up the cudgels on behalf of those people? I want to accuse them of being the worse culprits in this respect. I have seen with my own eyes what is going on in the Johannesburg City Council. In the mayor&#x2019;s Office in Johannesburg a Bantu delivery clerk is sharing an Office with two white typists. I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton, who also has a sense for finer things, whether she will allow her daughters to share an Office with a Bantu clerk?</p>

<p>What about the servant and employer relationship?</p>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>This is employee and employer relationship. Does that hon. member wants this to be a parallel case? The United Party has now admitted by implication here that they have no objections to integration and that we should simply throw open our distribution trade and clerical jobs throughout the country to Whites and non-Whites working together. This was said by the hon. member for Rosettenville and confirmed by the hon. member for Transkei. What is happening in the Office complexes in Johannesburg and in industries to-day? These people are working in the same Offices there. Are there separate toilet facilities for those people? Are there separate rest room facilities? Are there separate eating facilities? There are cases where such facilities simply do not exist. The United Party has become so blunted as far as racial feelings in South Africa are concerned, that it no longer cares about this sort of integrational mixing which is taking place between the various races. We on the other hand, welcome this measure. We are looking forward for this type of measure even to be extended at a later stage and that the position as regards the other race groups in South Africa be rectified as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Prime Minister made a plea yesterday that racial feelings should not be exploited in this House and in the election campaign. However, the very first thing we heard was a leading hon. member opposite making an attempt of that kind. I want to remind the hon. members opposite that in countless spheres of our national life Whites and non-Whites are working alongside. They are working alongside practically in equal numbers in the Army of our country.</p>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>That is not so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>They are working alongside practically in equal numbers in our Police Force. Indeed, I believe that the non-Whites at present outnumber the Whites <span class="col_1589-1590" refersTo="page_0809"/>in our Police Force. They share a van when they go after criminals and they share in risks and dangers, endeavouring to curtail crime and so forth. They are working alongside each other in countless spheres. As has been pointed out, Whites and non-Whites work together in the most intimate places, namely our homes. There we get non-Whites working alongside ourselves and our children. I suggest that it is a resort to the most blatant form of racialism to be hammering on this type of case at every possible opportunity. This is more particularly when we consider the fact that the hon. the Prime Minister has made a plea not to exploit racial feelings.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni says he is surprised that the United Party is opposing this clause. The new section 20A will empower the Minister to prescribe by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> that no Bantu labour is to be employed in any particular area, or any particular category of employment or by any particular employer of class of employer. This is really where the fundamental difference between this side of the House and that side of the House comes in, We say that ever since the beginning of time in South Africa the Whites have been the leaders and have had the leadership of the country. We are opposing this provision because we believe this is one of the measures which will help to undermine that position. I quite concede that hon. members opposite can take a different view. They believe that by refusing work opportunities and thereby causing unemployment in other spheres they are going to achieve what we believe should be achieved here in the interest of all. We most sincerely believe that measures of this kind will have the reverse effect. We say that if South Africans are to retain leadership, and nothing is needed more badly than that the Whites should retain the leadership, it is most essential that we should be strong economically so as to be able to support our forces to cope with outside interference and thereby enabling us to work out our problems ourselves. Secondly, it is most essential that we should have rising standards of living. There is one thing that the hon. members opposite must surely accept and that is that there should be no unemployment in this country. No less a person than the hon. the Prime Minister has stated quite categorically that it is the policy of the Nationalist Party to ensure full employment, ft was also stated quite categorically not so long ago by the hon. the Minister of Transport. He said that whatever else the case may be, they wish to ensure full employment. A measure of this kind is undoubtedly going to cause unemployment.</p>

<p>Nonsense!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>An hon. member says that it is nonsense. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education proudly got up in this House and said that in the course of the first year of the Physical Planning Act about 6,000 morgen have been denied to be developed for industry. As a result approximately a j million Bantu were no longer able to obtain employment. If the hon. the Minister is correct in stating this figure, I say there are at least a &#x00BD; million Bantu without employment at this very moment. Hon. members opposite live in a dream world if they think that those people are sitting happily in their huts in the Transkei and other homelands. That is not so. Those are the people of whom the Herstigtes are taking pictures in order to embarrass the Government. Those are the people who illegally infiltrate these so-called White parts of South Africa and they are the people who double up in the houses of friends in the townships. They are also the people who double up with servants who are working for White people outside the Native townships. It is an absolute myth to think that because you prevent these people from coming into decent employment they thereby sit peacefully in the Reserves. They cannot afford to do that. They have got to live and therefore they force their way in here. I am sure many of the hon. members attend the Native Commissioners courts regularly where one sees hundreds and hundreds of Native people who are being prosecuted because they have entered the urban areas illegally. It is so much a habit nowadays that they literally come in here in their scores and when they have saved up RIO they go about freely until they are caught. When they are caught they pay their RIO and they carry on as before in this way. If hon. members think that by denying employment to these people they are going to keep South Africa White, they are absolutely wrong. They are just going to have an ever-increasing number of Natives in the so-called White areas on an illegal basis. The United Party will admittedly retain influx control so that the number of Native people bears relation to the job opportunities and the housing available. However, we will most certainly not do what the Government is doing and that is artificially cause unemployment and keep a shortage of houses for the Natives in this country. In regard to the shortage of houses I want to make a serious accusation against the department. They thereby hope to force them back with the result that these people flock to the White townships where they find it more convenient to stay.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I have a very short time at my disposal. I should like to answer his question, but I still want to make several other points. I want to stress again that there is no White unemployment, there is no Coloured unemployment and therefore no Whites and Coloureds are going to suffer when some of these people are taken up in their work. Indeed, the whole experience of the hon. the Minister of Transport is, and he has said so, that the Whites rise in the work <span class="col_1591-1592" refersTo="page_0810"/>that they do. These are some of the reasons why we oppose this measure. I have no hesitation in saying that South Africa cannot afford to put brakes on its economy. I want to read to the hon. members what Mr. Jan S. Marais has said in a recent speech on the country s economy. Under the heading &#x201C;Rate of private investment dangerously low&#x201D; he says:</p>

<block name="quote">For quite some time now our rate of private investment as compared with our own past has been lagging much too far behind.</block>

<p>You only have to put enough discouragement in the way of industrialists and they just will not build their factories. When the Government prevent opportunities in established areas, the hon. members on that side hope that everybody will go to the border areas. However, that is not the way an industrialist works. They are discouraged and eventually they are so frustrated with regulations, prohibitions and difficulties that they just will not invest their money. Here, a most respected person, Mr. Marais, says that our rate of private investment is dangerously low. What does it mean if our rate of private investment remains so dangerously low? It means unemployment and under-employment. Even the words of the hon. the Prime Minister were that it is a basic aim of his policy to ensure full employment for no lesser reason than the fact that it is essential for the peacefulness of the country. Everybody knows this is the case. In order to have a contented population, there must not be unemployment and perhaps a suffering from not having sufficient money to buy food, etc. Consequently, when we oppose a measure like this we want the economy, within reason, to be set free. By the end of the century we will have a population of 40 million Blacks in this country, leave aside the 8 million Coloureds and 6 million Whites and Indians. We are going to have a big population and we have a big population already. The figures already show that far too many people are living below the poverty datum line. If hon. members think that when people are below the poverty datum line they are more likely to be peace-loving than if they are well to do, I disagree with them. I therefore say that in the interest of the things the hon. member for Benoni and other hon. members opposite want, which is that the country should go forward under White leadership, we believe that we have a duty to the whole country.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands made a terrible fuss, but in my opinion he was not hitting the mark. This clause does not deal with unemployment or with brakes on our economy. This clause deals with the protection of white workers in the white areas. This seems to be the point on which there is some misunderstanding. The Minister is taking wide powers so as to enable him to take certain steps when it is necessary to do so, and this is an anti-integration measure. But the hon. member for Pinelands made great play here of the attitude the hon. the Prime Minister adopted here when he said that we should not disturb race relations. The hon. member said this clause would disturb race relations, but does he not understand that the very reason for including this clause is to preserve race relations. There is danger of a certain degree of integration and a certain number of non-Whites is being taken into certain jobs and trades; unfair competition is taking place. Work reservation is the accepted policy of this side of the House and this side of the House has undertaken to protect the white workers in their own areas. Now the hon. the Minister is taking these powers to protect the type of worker for whom no provision has been made in the work reservation legislation, and the very reason for taking these powers is to make provision for that as it takes a considerable time to implement the procedure laid down in the work reservation legislation. I think the hon. member is taking a completely wrong view of this position. I can understand their being opposed to this, and I shall say why this is so, but before proceeding to do so, I just want to say that the hon. member for Houghton has become the protector of the Hertzog Party. She accused us of having introduced this clause because of that party, but she is wrong. That party is not important.</p>

<p>This clause is a logical consequence of our policy, and this Bill was drafted and introduced last year, before that small party even existed. She should not hold any brief for them, because they are as extreme in the one direction as she is in the other. I can understand why the hon. member for Houghton will vote against this legislation, because she advocates equality. She is not interested in the Whites nor is she interested in the non-Whites; they should compete against one another, and the devil takes the hindmost! But the United Party will also vote against this measure because it is not interested in either the Whites or the Bantu. Their interest in the Bantu goes no further than the Bantu being an employee in and an appendage of the economy of the Whites. They want to use the non-Whites as cheap labour in order to fill their own pockets at the fastest possible rate. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>After all, they speak of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;. They do not care if non-Whites come into the white areas and work more cheaply than the Whites do. They are simply concerned about the economy, no matter what that might lead to. [Interjection.] They do not want to protect the Whites. But the National Party has introduced this clause, as well as this measure, for the basic reason that the protection of the Whites is its policy and because the National Party admits that the Whites are the only ones who have any right to be in the white areas and that non-Whites who come into that area cannot come there with demands. This, i.e. that the non-Whites <span class="col_1593-1594" refersTo="page_0811"/>may be present there, is a concession made by the Whites.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly, because that is our policy, and during the coming election you will hear a great deal more from us about the attitude you are adopting in this regard. This is why you have lost one election after the other and will lose this one as well. You get angry when we say that you stand for integration, but what are you doing now? You are voting against an integration measure. [Interjection.] In other words, the Opposition is in favour of integration. The Government will see to it that the white workers will be protected against unreasonable and unfair competition, and these people we are dealing with now are people who are sorely needed for promoting the development of their own areas.</p>

<p>As far as I know this clause is not going to be applied in the border areas. Some of these people are already employed in those areas, but this clause will be applied in the heartland of the Whites. As I have said, this Government will proceed and will carry this clause through, and this clause will stand as another foundation of our policy. If we cannot carry this through, we may as well drop our policy, but we are doing this because of the mandate we received in 1948. We are still building.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg made a very revealing comment at the end of his speech. He said to this House that the Government is introducing this measure in fulfilment of the mandate they got in the 1948 election. Then why on earth has it taken them 21 years to carry out this mandate? You see, Sir, the chickens of the Nationalist Party are beginning to come home to roost. The &#x201C;volk daar buite&#x201D; are beginning to realize that the Nationalist Party made a whole number of rash promises in order to get into power in 1948, and although they have been in power for 21 years these promises have not been fulfilled and their policies have not been carried out. If the hon. member for Pietersburg wants to use our opposition to this clause and to this Bill in order to stir up racial feeling against the United Party and to make propaganda to the effect that we are an integrationist party, he is welcome to use this sort of propaganda in spite of the fact that his Prime Minister urged him and other hon. members of this House not to conduct the election campaign on this basis. But if he wants to do it on this basis, he is welcome to do so, and we are not going to follow him because the &#x201C;volk daar buite&#x201D; are going to show this Nationalist Party on 22nd April that they are sick and tired of this type of propaganda in this day and age. The Nationalist Party still thinks that the voters are a lot of cattle who are unable to think for themselves and who cannot see how this Government has been misleading them for the last 21 years. They are going to show this Government at this election that they are not going to be bluffed any longer.</p>

<p>I propose to do so now, Sir. Now, in order to appreciate this clause in its full effect, it is necessary to see it in the context of what the Nationalist Party has been trying to do for the last 21 years. One would have thought that after 21 years in Office, with year after year amendments to the Bantu laws of this country, the Nationalist Government would like the country to believe that at this stage it has completed, or at least almost completed, its apartheid blueprint.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I am just trying to put the clause into its right context. We find that just about all the legal and administrative machinery to carry out separate development exists, but in practice what do we find? That it is not working, and the more it does not work, the more it fails, the more there is a continuing physical presence of urban Bantu in what the Nationalists like to refer to as white South Africa, the more desperate they become and the more far-reaching and wide powers they take; the greater the conflict between the theory of separate development, the theory of apartheid, and the continuing inter-dependence of the South African economy on white skills and capital on the one hand and black labour on the other, the more that conflict takes place, the more uncompromising the Government tries to get in its legislation and in its attitude in order to try to make something of its ideology. So we have this latest example of madness on the part of this Government. That is the only way it can be described, as madness, when you consider that one Minister, the Minister of Bantu Administration, is taking upon himself the power to control completely the Bantu work force in this country in every possible sphere and in every possible comer of this land. This is what the amendment in this clause is going to do. It is giving the Minister such far-reaching powers, and the hon. the Deputy Minister will not deny that. His own <span class="col_1595-1596" refersTo="page_0812"/>White Paper says that this is to empower the Minister to prescribe by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> &#x2014;now he is going to change this by saying that he will give a month&#x2019;s notice, but he will still do what he likes whether he gives notice in the <i>Gazette</i> or not&#x2014;that no Bantu labour is to be employed in any particular area. He can prevent any single Bantu from being employed in any particular area, and a particular area can also refer to a complete province, if he wishes to do so. He can prevent the use of Bantu labour in any category of employment, which means in a particular industry, or by any particular employer. He can tell a specific employer, &#x201C;I am not going to allow you to have a single Bantu in your labour force&#x201D;. Finally, he can prevent any class of employer from employing a Bantu. Sir, I doubt very much that this House has been asked to grant to any one Minister more far-reaching powers than these.</p>

<p>It is clearly intended to use this power. Despite the way in which the hon. the Deputy Minister in his Second Reading address tried to show this House that this was a very mild measure, the White Paper says that it would be possible under this clause, for example, to prohibit the employment of Bantu typists or receptionists outside the Bantu areas. &#x201C;Outside the Bantu areas&#x201D;; that means in the whole of white South Africa and outside the border industrial areas. Sir, it is all very well for the White Paper to speak about Bantu typists and receptionists because there are probably not very many of them, but if this clause goes so far as to empower the Minister, as indeed it does, to prohibit the employment of Bantu typists or receptionists outside the Bantu areas, it also gives the power to the Minister to prohibit the employment of for example, Bantu domestic servants or Bantu building artisans or Bantu tractor drivers anywhere outside the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>Sir, it is conspicuous that two successive speakers of the Opposition wanted to hide behind the hon. the Prime Minister. They wanted to look for assistance from the hon. the Prime Minister, hut yester day the hon. the Prime Minister asked this House in an extremely responsible way not to incite racialism amongst the Whites and racialism towards the Bantu. But the hon. the Prime Minister has already set the example for us on this side of the House in three powerful speeches of how we are to make short work of the United Party and the people between that party and the hon. member for Houghton in the course of our campaign for the coming election. The hon. the Prime Minister has set that example for us in this House and that is what we are going to do with hon. members opposite, including the hon. member for Houghton. It is a great pity that one never finds the opportunity to enter her electoral division.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Houghton also said a very important thing here, something which illustrates the basic difference between her party and our party.

As the hon. member for Benoni said here, this is the very issue on which our policies differ as far as this section is concerned.

<p>There we have the other basic difference I want to point out, and I am sorry to see that the hon. member for Pinelands is not present at the moment. I take it that he has left the Chamber for a few minutes only, but I cannot wait until he returns. The hon. member for Pinelands wanted to make a very great issue of the United Party allegedly standing for white leadership and for the protection of white leadership, also in the field of labour. But what do we find in this booklet of theirs. &#x201C;You want it, we have it&#x201D;? From this booklet it appears that that can never happen. It is stated here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party recognizes that White and non-White depend upon one another for economic advancement.</block>

<p>This all sounds very good&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It accepts the advantages that flow from this &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is what interests that party most, i.e. the economic advantages. As soon as a debate is conducted in this House on any matter which may affect the economic advantages of the <span class="col_1597-1598" refersTo="page_0813"/>people whose interests that side of this House wants to promote, we have the kind of tirade we had here this afternoon. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; namely the development of our country and the creation of job opportunities for non-Whites and Whites on a scale impossible if non-White labour is restricted or totally barred.</block>

<p>In other words, the United Party is opposed to the restriction of non-white labour; this is what it amounts to. They are opposed to the restriction of non-white labour; that is their policy, and that is what the whole problem is about. Now I should like to put the following question to hon. members opposite: If one reads this policy of theirs correctly&#x2014;one need not even interpret it&#x2014;i.e. no restriction on non-White labour, how do hon. members opposite expect, with the numerical ratio we have in South Africa, to protect the white man as leader in this field of labour?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton likes to make the statement in this House that we as Whites should feel inferior for some reason or other, and the question is posed whether we do regard ourselves as being inferior? I want to tell the hon. member for Houghton that the danger of inferiority is not involved in this at all. She likes to say that the verkrampte members on her right are the cause of this, but, Sir, in my town there is no verligte or verkrampte people&#x2014;that is for the hon. member&#x2019;s information. There are positive people in my constituency and I can tell you, Sir, that everyone in my constituency, supporters of both the National and the United Parties, welcome this measure. The members opposite and the hon. member for Houghton are the only ones who are making such a fuss about this measure. We welcome the support which is being given to the measure, because what this measure deals with is not something verlig or verkramp; it deals with positive people who have their feet firmly on the ground, who realize that one cannot allow labour integration on such a scale in South Africa. With regard to labour integration, I want to tell the hon. member for Pinelands that he need not point out to us the fact that Whites and non-Whites are working together in the Police Force. Of course we recognize traditional fields of labour. In this case, as the hon. member for Benoni said, the basis is completely different; this is a field of labour in which employers-employees&#x2019; relations exist. But this side of the House is prepared to protect certain traditional fields of labour for the Whites. This side of the House is prepared, as far as certain traditional jobs are concerned, to ensure that the White man will be able to go on doing those jobs in South Africa for many, many years to come. There is no point in asking us, &#x201C;Who is looking after your children; who is working in your gardens and who is working in your kitchens?&#x201D;. It is nonsense to argue in that way. What we are concerned with here, is employers-employees&#x2019; relations on the broader basis as against labour integration. The fact of the matter simply is that hon. members opposite are only interested in the economic aspect. As long as they are able to obtain non-White labour in excess at the cheapest rates at which they can obtain such labour so as to fill their own pockets in that way. the matter is of importance to them, but when other matters are at stake, we get the kind of thing we have been getting here to-day. I think it will do hon. members opposite a great deal of good if they will bear in mind the following paragraph that was written by the editor of <i>The Friend</i> in April, 1966. To my mind this is the basic difference between the two parties. With reference to the National Party he said &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The magnet that attracted this support, the National Party, cannot be regarded in orthodox political terms because it is not an orthodox political party. It is the catalyst of a powerful developing cultural movement; it is a people on the march.</block>

<p>Sir, this party is also inspired with the cultural aspects of our people, with the entire cultural way of life on which it is intent&#x2014;economically, politically and otherwise&#x2014;but hon. members opposite cannot realize this. They cannot experience <span class="col_1599-1600" refersTo="page_0814"/>these things, because it is too nice to look at pounds, shillings and pence. That is what this whole thing is about. Hon. members opposite should begin to see this matter in its wider context. I do not want to discuss the development in the border areas and in the border industries and the challenge that awaits us there; perhaps this may be discussed later in the debate, but this is where the basic difference is to be found, and this is the reason for the opposition of the other side.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to return. Sir, to the passage that I was reading out of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech. He said (Hansard, Volume 27, column 8478)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I stress that the idea is not to prevent, by means of the new provisions, larger number of certain categories of Bantu workers from being employed in any particular job. That is not the intention.</block>

<p>Sir, if that is not the intention, then why is the clause drafted in this way? Because this is precisely what can be done in terms of this clause. Why make the clause so far-reaching if this is not the intention? I want to emphasize the following passage, because this is completely contrary to what is stated in the White Paper. He goes on to say (Hansard, Volume 27, column 8478):</p>

<block name="quote">Recently an allegation of this nature was made, i.e. that the Minister would prohibit Bantu from, for example, driving lorries or from doing any work in the Western Cape.</block>

<p>This is exactly what can be done. The White Paper even says so. It says that Bantu can be prohibited from being employed in any particular area. Such an area could be the Western Cape. They can also be prohibited from being employed in any particular category. Such a category can include lorry drivers. Bantu can therefore be prohibited from doing any work in the Western Cape. So what the hon. the Deputy Minister says this clause cannot do, or was not intended to do, is precisely what the White Paper says the clause is presumably intended to do, because this is what it says the clause means. If it is not intended to do that, why do we have the clause at all? In his speech last year (Hansard, Volume 27, column 8478), the hon. the Deputy Minister continued to play down this clause, and said:</p>

<block name="quote">The number of cases to which the prohibition will be made applicable will, in terms of the above-mentioned circumstances, be relatively negligible.</block>

<p>Sir, this is typical of the Nationalist Party. It takes far-reaching powers to control the lives of millions of Bantu in order to deal with circumstances which the hon. the Deputy Minister himself describes as &#x201C;relatively negligible&#x201D;. Sir, this House cannot be expected to pass a law on this basis. The key to this extraordinary measure is of course to be found in a new subsection which the hon. the Deputy Minister wishes to introduce. How does this new subsection read? It is very curious. Subsection (3) of the new section 20A will read as follows (Hansard, Volume 27, column 8479):</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1601-1602" refersTo="page_0815"/>The Minister may, by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, amend or withdraw a prohibition referred to in subsection (1) or may grant exemption from such a prohibition to a specified employer or specified class of employers.</block>

<p>I ask you, Sir, who are the employers who will get these exemptions? It is quite obvious that the persons who have been getting exemptions from this Government in the past will get them again. They are the Nationalist supporters and persons who are prepared to pay money to this Government. They are the ones who will get these exemptions. That is exactly what is going to happen under this far-reaching measure. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Everybody is very hot under the collar. Perhaps I can infuse a little sweet reasonableness into the Chamber. You know how soothing I am, Sir. The hon. member for Benoni is probably the hon. member who interests me most in this House. He made the allegation this afternoon that he had witnessed the scandalous sight of two White typists working together with an African clerk. They were sharing an Office with an African clerk. Imagine that in this day and age! What a shocking thing, when you come to think of it! I do not know what one is supposed to do at this revelation. Is one meant to throw up one&#x2019;s hands in horror, or just say that after all South Africa is a multi-racial country. There are 3] million White people living here, and about 17 million non-White people. The chances are that in every single walk of life we are going to find Africans, Coloured people, Indian people, and White people sharing what this country has to offer by way of employment, facilities, and everything else. Whatever laws this Government has passed, that in fact is still the pattern in South Africa. The hon. member would like to retain a master-servant relationship. Apparently that is all right. As long as there is a relationship of White man equals master and Black man equals servant, the relationship between those two can be as intimate as one can imagine. There can be intimacy in the home with a Black servant caring for White children, caring for the White mistress and caring for the White master. That is all right. A Black labourer can work under the most intimate circumstances with a White apprentice or White journeyman. That is all right, but the minute this contact takes place at any level of human relationships, at the level of equality, that is wrong. &#x201C;Equality&#x201D; is the hideous word. This is the word that turns all Nationalists grey. This is what the thought of equality between the races does to them. I have news for these hon. members It is now 1970. The world has outlawed race discrimination. Even the speech yesterday of the President of the United States, who is not known to be a wild liberal, shows quite clearly that the official stand in America is against racial discrimination <i>per se</i>. Sooner or later, unless this country wants to be completely isolated at the tip of a Black continent where something like 300 million Black people live, we are going to have to fall into line. The sooner people begin to adapt their philosophy and their psychology to the simple facts of life in the world in the 1970s, the better. I want to tell the hon. member quite frankly that I do not get upset at the idea of my daughters sharing an Office with non-Whites. It does not worry me in the slightest. [Interjections.] They have the choice. I would not force them into it if they did not want to do so. If they objected to something like that, they would net have to do it. Will the hon. member for Benoni tell me why those two White typists do not leave the Johannesburg Municipality? Are they shackled to their desks, in chains? There is a shortage of trained clerical workers in Johannesburg and those two young ladies, if they wanted to, could get a job to-morrow anywhere else they like. Presumably they do not mind. Why should the autocratic member for Benoni decide that they have got to mind? This is what I want to know. By virtue of what does the autocratic member for Benoni and the hon. member for Potchefstroom, Potchefstroom which after all is a metropolis, as all of us know, and the hon. the Deputy Minister take unto themselves these autocratic powers to decide that people must mind. Let them choose for themselves. This is after all meant to be a democracy of a sort. Therefore it is not up to this Government to impose its narrow-minded bigoted philosophy on everybody else in this country from above. That is my first point. Incidentally, not one of these members has been able to offer one single explicit example of racial friction as a result of this. Perhaps some old lady ran into the residence of the hon. member for Potchefstroom and complained bitterly that she had been served by a Black woman. Perhaps the hon. member can tell us whether this was what happened.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, it did not happen. He cannot tell us about this. I will tell you, Sir, when the lady will come running into his Office and that is when she cannot get any service at all. That is when you will find the White ladies complaining. It is when they cannot get any service in the Offices of a municipality, the Civil Service and even of private enterprises. That is when the complaints come flying in and that is when job reservation goes out of the window. It interests me that nobody can give me any example of racial friction under this so-called economic integration that has got to be prevented. Nobody can. Yet whenever anybody talks about racial friction, the first person who has got to suffer is the non-White. It is never the White who has got to give way, it is always the non-White who has got to give way. But interestingly enough nobody has given us one single example of racial friction. This is all a lot of nonsense. I want to tell the hon. member for Benoni and the hon. member for Potchefstroom that jobs that 10 years ago were considered White jobs, to-day have all been taken over by non-Whites. There is no such animal as a traditional White job anymore, for the simple reason that there are not enough White people to do these jobs that used to be done by White people. There is one excellent reason for this too and that is that South Africa, thank heaven, has an expanding economy. As the cake grows bigger, <b>all of</b> us are getting bigger slices and not <b>smaller</b> slices and all of us are even getting a few of the crumbs. The transition that has taken place, has taken place to the advantage of every single person in this country. Everyone benefits as the <span class="col_1605-1606" refersTo="page_0817"/>non-White becomes a consumer, as the non-White is able to produce more and as the non-White is able to spend more.

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister will have the power in terms of clause 11 to cancel contracts with the stroke of a pen. This is a power far greater than that of the hon. Minister of Planning. He cannot cancel existing contracts. He can stop the extension or expansion of existing businesses but he cannot cancel existing labour contracts. But that hon. Deputy Minister crouched in his corner over there has taken unto himself this power. I want him to give me one concrete example of where the racial friction that he talks about has been brought to his notice. If he has such an example, is it the sort of example of which an intelligent person ought to take any notice or is it the sort of bigoted nonsense that one would expect from the super verkramptes who sit on my right. [Interjections.] They are not here at the moment. In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Deputy Minister said: &#x201C;This is a precautionary measure against White-Bantu labour integration&#x201D;, a precaution, something like a Nationalist pill. It is a precaution against something which if it is happening, has not caused any racial friction at all, and if it is happening, is happening for the simple reason that South Africa is expanding and that her economy is demanding that more and more people be gainfully employed. There are not enough Botha babies being produced to meet the needs of the country. The hon. the Minister looks very dejected about this.</p>

<p>In reply to a statement made by the hon. member for Potchefstroom, the hon. member for Walmer said that they did not find it necessary to protect the white worker.

<p>They are not prepared to protect the lazy people. The hon. member did, however, use the word &#x201C;efficiency&#x201D;. In any event, it means that if that is the only criterion, they can see no reason for protecting the white workers against integration in industry. I challenge them to deny that this is a logical deduction. The noisy back-benchers are keeping quiet now. I ask them to reply to my question. I say again that this is a logical deduction from their opposition to this clause and from their interjections about &#x201C;efficiency&#x201D; as being the only criterion, that they do not reesrd it necessary to protect the white worker against integration in the industry. They are keeping quiet now; they are not saying a word now. We therefore have to deduce that this is <span class="col_1607-1608" refersTo="page_0818"/>in fact the case. I have an interesting document here which reads, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The application of such a colour bar will be essential in order to protect the higher standards of living of the more advanced white man against the impact of the non European who could otherwise displace the white worker as a result of unequal competition.

<p>This clause is essentially of a positive nature and that is that it creates the climate to protect the position of the white worker from being threatened. For that reason the Opposition should support the clause. But they are not going to support it. Furthermore, it will enable us to canalize the labour which is returned to the homelands and to create an infra-structure there. That is another reason why the Opposition should support this clause. But they have a policy which is based on a chance to escape through a backdoor.</p>

<p>He was completely wrong, with respect to the hon. member. He was completely wrong. He took completely out of context something which was written in that book. He also took completely amiss a statement made by my friend, the hon. member for Walmer. He did not accept the word of that hon. member that he did not say what the hon. member for Bloemfontein (West) said he did say. Because of that, I am afraid we cannot accept anything that he has said. It is impossible to accept it. I hope the hon. member for Umhlatuzana does not run away, because I want to speak to him. He is not important but there is something I want to say to him anyway. If the hon. member had taken the trouble to read that book, &#x201C;The Answer&#x201D;, intelligently, if that is possible, he would have seen that we will protect the white worker. [Interjections.] Now really and truly, what is going on? Oh. there is the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. He is terribly nervous of losing his seat on the 22nd April. I will speak to him in a moment. He must just wait his turn. His turn is coming. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (West) knows perfectly well that we would have known, had he read the book and had he been able to understand what was written, that it is our intention to protect and to do so by the only equitable method in which all workers can be protected, namely the application of the rate for the job.

<p>We have here a clause about which I can imagine a visitor to this country would say, &#x201C;This must be one of the most wonderful countries in the world, because it must have over-employment&#x201D;. A clause such as this, where a Minister takes power to limit the spheres in which certain people can be employed, can only be presented in circumstances of over-employment of all the people in the country. Is this the position in South Africa to-day? Is there full employment in South Africa to-day? The hon. Minister of Labour perpetually says &#x201C;No&#x201D; when we ask this question. But when we ask for statistics on the number of Bantu who are unemployed, he is unable to give those figures. When we ask the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development for those figures, he is unable to give us those figures.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Up to now we have not been able to get figures of unemployed Bantu in the White areas. In the absence of any such figures, perhaps this clause could be justified, if we were satisfied that there was no unemployment. But we were given figures by the hon. member for Nelspruit last week that there were 30,000 unemployed Bantu males and 420,000 unemployed Bantu females within the White areas. Surely, Sir, this must have a bearing on this particular clause. If there are 450,000 unemployed Bantu in the White areas, why does this hon. Minister want to take the power to further reduce the employment opportunities available to these people? He went further than that. I asked the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development if he could tell us how many registered work seekers there were in certain areas of the country to try to establish whether or not these powers are essential to this Government or not, whether they are in the best interests of this country. What was the reply of the hon. the Minister? He replied on the 10th February as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">A reply can only be furnished after return has been obtained from all tribal labour bureaux, which is not considered justified in the circumstances. It is therefore regretted that the information required cannot be given.</block>

<p>Is this hon. Minister satisfied that there is no unemployment? Does he think that there is over employment of Bantu in this country? Is that why he requires this legislation now, namely, in order to remove Bantu who are employed? Is the hon. the Minister able to provide them with suitable alternative accommodation when he has removed them? During his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister said that this would enable him to prevent Bantu being used as drivers. I want to ask the hon. the Minister the direct question whether he has been able to solve the difficulties of the Johannesburg City Council in regard to bus and lorry drivers? Is the hon the Deputy Minister introducing this clause for the express purpose to enable him to compel the Johannesburg City Council to desist <span class="col_1611-1612" refersTo="page_0820"/>from using Bantu as drivers of buses and of lorries. Mr. Chairman, I see you are looking at the clock and I presume my time is running out. I will resume my seat now and I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will reply in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) said nothing at all. What he said, was of minor importance. He made one statement, however, and that is to imply that our people are lazy and that we were afraid of the Bantu. That hon. member may in his heart be afraid of the Bantu because of where he comes from, but I do not know of anyone who is afraid on this side of the House. This clause is a very important one. I find it interesting that the hon. member for Houghton, in spite of the filthy <i>(liederlike)</i> statements she makes, for example, that she does not mind two White typists working with a Bantu clerk, is at least honest &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#bodenstein">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw that word. The hon. member for Houghton makes wrong statements, but she is at least honest and says what she believes. However. I do not <b>like the smokescreen and the egg-dance of</b> hon. members on the other side. Why do they not rather mention the positive aspect of this clause? I want to say that this clause is one of the most important clauses regarding Bantu laws ever to have been piloted through this House. The hon. the Opposition is aware of this and that is why they say there are so many unemployed people among the Bantu. The hon. member for Hillbrow is in and out of this House all day because his whole policy of economic integration is at stake. It is very interesting to see what the hon. the Opposition is most afraid of. We are dealing with three Opposition parties now. One of them consists of a lady who is not afraid of airing her opinions, although I am completely put off by her. She forms the smallest opposition party. The second smallest party displays so little interest in the future of the White man in South Africa that not one of them is in his seat. They are busy intriguing in the dark again. That is characteristic of them. My greatest enemies, however, are still those of the third group, that is the United Party. [Interjections.) The hon. member for North Rand is a blue-blooded U.P. man. Those hon. members know that this particular clause in the Bill will ensure the success of the policy of distinctive development. This clause will exercise the control. The hon. member for Houghton knows that economic integration is possible to-day because it is possible for two White typists to work with a non-White typist. The hon. member mentioned her own daughter, and said she could <b>do what she wanted to</b>. Surely, the hon. member knows that she is leading a protected life because she is financially strong. I do not think the two white ladies in the Johannesburg municipality she mentioned are in the position financially to tell their employers: &#x201C;We refuse to work with a Bantu.&#x201D; The hon. member, however, is protected at her social parties and in her other associations with the Bantu. She can always protect herself by means of her money. The people of South Africa object to and repudiate any concept of integration, whether economic or social integration. Economic integration leads to social integration, and that is why I say that clause II is a very important one. We shall make great play of the objections of the United Party in this respect during the coming election. Hon. members on the other side are throwing up this smokescreen about unemployment. Has the hon. member for Pine-lands not read Dr. Rautenbach&#x2019;s report? Has he not read of what is being done in connection with border industries? Has he not seen the employment prospects of the Bantu in border industries and in their homelands? The hon. member for Hillbrow is on his way out again, and so it will continue, but on 22nd April this liberal tendency will be finally repudiated by the people of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, for more than a year now this clause has received a great deal of attention in the Press and once again in this House today. This clause is of cardinal importance to this side of the House. Why? Because this clause perpetuates labour apartheid. That is why it is so important to us. I want to say at once that what is at stake now, is by no means a new principle. In 1951 a certain piece of legislation was passed in this House, the so-called Building Workers Act, which prohibited Bantu building workers from building in White cities. Hon. members in this House are all aware of this. Therefore, this is no new principle. A great deal has been written about this clause, and as regards what was written I can say that I have seldom had to do with a matter in respect of which there has been as much misinterpretation as has been the case in regard to this specific clause. I have here a thick file of these misrepresentations with which I would be able to take up the time of the House, but I am not going to do so now. To-day some of those misrepresentations were once again heard from the Opposition. However, what are the real background and facts in regard to clause 11? In the light of the misrepresentations that have been made, we are obliged to know precisely what this is. Most of what I am going to say was said in the course of the Second Reading debate, but judging by the arguments advanced by hon. members opposite, it has still not been grasped. The first is that what this clause seeks to do&#x2014; for social reasons, not for other reasons&#x2014;is to exclude Bantu from professions where their employment in this White part of South Africa <span class="col_1613-1614" refersTo="page_0821"/>gives offence and where it threatens to disturb racial harmony. This is the object of this clause. I replied to the question whether all the prohibitions now contained in clause 11, could not in any case be dealt with by the Department of Labour under the work reservation provision of section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act. The answer is no, for the simple reason that we are dealing here with two separate matters. In section 77 one has to do with competition in the sphere of labour and how to eliminate it, i.e. to eliminate competition in the sphere of labour, not only between Whites and Bantu, but also between Whites and non-Whites in South Africa. That is what is involved under the Industrial Conciliation Act. However, this clause does not deal with that at all. This is not a so-called job reservation clause. What is more, I have already said this and it has also been recorded in Hansard, column 8477 on 18th June, 1969. At that time I said very explicitly that this clause was not a work reservation clause. And I said that it does in fact follow that this was complementary to the section on work reservation, section 77.</p>

<p>I also want to make a second point to indicate why, in terms of section 77, which falls under the Department of Labour, we cannot put a stop to this labour integration which we want to stop. The provisions of section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act apply to all trades. In terms of this section every specified trade has to be gone into. This is a lengthy and cumbersome process. As I have already said, it applies to all non-White races. Consequently it cannot possibly comply with the objects of this clause. For that reason my Department and I had our first talks on this question as far back as 1963. These have developed in the wording of clause 11 as it reads to-day. The question that may now arise, is what do we envisage with this clause 11. As I have already put it before, our aim is to stop up small cracks which are appearing in the wall. In the categories where male and female Bantu workers are working along with Whites and giving offence and disturbing racial harmony in that process, we want to intervene so that Bantu may be prevented from working in those specified categories. I want to name these categories of employment. Those specific hair-cracks which are appearing in the wall&#x2014; those who have travelled all over the country have probably noticed them already&#x2014;are. for instance, Bantu typists employed in White Offices. For social reasons the Whites in South Africa are not content with this. There are many Bantu who are not content with it either. Why does this have to be the case? I want to emphasize that only Whites and Bantu are involved here. We want to put a stop to this in good time, since we are absolutely convinced that if this is not done&#x2014;precisely because of the arguments the Opposition has often advanced here, i.e. that there is a manpower shortage&#x2014;it would have far-reaching consequences. In this manner, in 1951 for instance, skilled Bantu building workers were forbidden to work in the White area. Who can rise herp to-day and say that this was not done for the benefit of the Bantu? If we had not done that, we would never have been able to provide the Bantu housing that has in fact been provided. In this case we want to do precisely the same thing. By preventing, in good time, Bantu typists from working in White Offices, we want to prevent friction between Bantu and Whites. This would, in addition, only be to the advantage of the Bantu. I am being very specific in my explanations. I do not want any misunderstanding, because many wild allegations have been made here about this Bill and about clause 11 in particular. I do not think this is in the interests of South Africa. I want nobody to be under a misapprehension in regard to this matter. Nor is there any need for anybody to be under a misapprehension if he has ears to hear and the intelligence to understand.</p>

<p>The second category of employment which is involved here, is that of counter-assistants. In this case we are once again doing it for social reasons and for no other reasons. By these means we want to eliminate racial friction where Bantu counter-assistants are increasingly being employed in the private sector for the purpose of serving Whites. There are many Whites who are not content with this. Similarly there are many Bantu who are not content with this, either. All we seek to do is to put a stop to it. We cannot do this in terms of any section of any other Act. That is why this legislation is necessary.</p>

<p>The third specific category in respect of which we seek to eliminate racial friction, is the category where Bantu women are employed in the reception rooms of doctors and other organizations for the purpose of receiving Whites there. This does, of course, cause racial friction. It does, of course, cause social problems as well. We want to put a stop to this in good time.</p>

<p>The next category of employment which we specifically have in mind here, is where Bantu are employed as barmen. I could easily have asked hon. members on that side of the House whether they are content with Whites being served by Bantu typists, Bantu counter-assistants and Bantu barmen, because before long we might have the case of a Bantu woman standing behind a bar counter and serving liquor to the White men present there. In order to put a stop to such a thing in good time, we need clause 11.</p>

<p>The fifth category I want to mention, is the category where Bantu telephone operators are employed at hotels and other public places for the purpose of serving Whites. I want to repeat that this has caused a great deal of embarrassment. Hon. members will notice that the actual number of Bantu involved in these six categories of employment I mentioned, is from the nature of the case very small at this stage. That is why I say that we want to stop up in good time the hair-cracks appearing in the wall. Let me say with great emphasis that at National Party congresses resolutions Were <span class="col_1615-1616" refersTo="page_0822"/>passed in regard to this matter. Resolutions in this regard have also been passed by other organizations, and requests have been made to the Government to place such a measure on the Statute Book so that a stop may be put to this by these means. That is why I find it so astonishing that hon. members on that side of the House object so vehemently to this legislation in terms of, as they put it, their policy. I simply cannot understand this. I have already said with great emphasis that the statements made in newspapers on this clause and also the way hon. members represented it here to-day, do not reflect the true state of affairs. At times my hair literally stood on end when I read how this clause was represented in the newspapers. According to the newspapers and those hon. members, the hon. the Minister will now have the power to exclude large numbers of Bantu from employment here in South Africa; he will have the power to regulate the life of every Bantu in South Africa; he will have the power to control the economy of the country and to paralyse it. But the accusations which are now being levelled, are not acceptable to a reasonable person, particularly not if they are viewed in the light of my explanation of what is being envisaged with this legislation and why this clause has to be placed on the Statute Book. In order to add emphasis to this point I just want to say that this kind of statement which has been and is being blazoned forth into the world and has once again been made by hon. members on that side of the House this afternoon, is definitely not aimed at promoting racial harmony in South Africa. I notice that the hon. member for Pinelands is not present. But he became eloquent here as a result of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s having said here yesterday that racial harmony should have priority in South Africa and be maintained at all times. We endorse every word of that. But the statement made on that side of the House to-day is precisely aimed at disturbing racial harmony. If the Bantu outside are really to believe what the hon. Opposition is saying here, namely that this side of the House is now going to turn Bantu out of their employment and cause large-scale unemployment in South Africa and paralyse the economy of South Africa as a result, then, surely, friction will be caused. Surely this will not go down with the Bantu. We viewed this in a serious light, and last year on 25th April I addressed roughly 40,000 Bantu at Meadowlands. That was after the Second Reading had been passed here. This is what I told those Bantu at the time [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sometimes the newspapers cause misunderstanding, and you should not and may not believe everything you read in them. You will, for instance, have seen that the newspapers say that the Government is introducing a law, the Bantu Laws Amendment Act, in terms of which, so they say, the Government intends to rob the Bantu of their <b>employment in White areas. This impression is</b> being created in regard to section 11 of this Act. I deal with that Act. And I am telling you here and now that this is not true at all. We do not have such an intention, nor is this the object of this Act. Where there are certain Whites &#x2026;</block>

<p>Bear in mind that I was addressing 40,000 Bantu&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; who employ Bantu in positions where they stand behind counters serving other Whites, which causes friction and embarrassment to both Bantu and Whites, the intention is to put a stop to that thing in good time before it goes too far, that thing which as yet has only been cropping up in a few places and which involves only a few Bantu as yet, that thing which is making and will make trouble for the Bantu; it is for that reason, and for no other reason, that we are placing clause 11 on the Statute Book. That is all that is being envisaged. No more, and through this Act you will therefore not be robbed of your employment. You may therefore reject the stories about this matter, for now you know the truth.</block>

<p>This is how simple the whole position is. However, a few other statements were made as well. The hon. member for Houghton has asked me and expects me to mention a string of examples of racial friction caused as a result of this state of affairs in South Africa. I am very grateful that I am not able to do that. If I were able to do that, it would have amounted to this Government&#x2019;s having neglected its duty shamefully. I am grateful that I am unable to do so. I am also grateful that it is possible for me to introduce this clause for the very purpose of putting a stop to that sort of thing in good time. If we do not put a stop to it now, I shall perhaps in one or two years&#x2019; time have to come to this House with a long list of instances of racial friction.</p>

<p>It shows, therefore, how timely this legislation is and how absolutely essential and urgent this legislation has become. I think I have replied in general to all the points raised by the hon. members on that side of the House. Therefore I do not consider it necessary to reply further to specific questions. I therefore want to content myself with saying that it is absolutely wrong to make the statement that by means of this Bill uncertainty will be caused amongst the Bantu and amongst the White employers as well. I submit that the opposite is true. By placing on the Statute Book this clause along with the amendments which have now been moved, certainty is precisely what is going to be created amongst the Bantu workers. They will know that it will not be possible for them to obtain work in certain categories of employment. <span class="col_1617-1618" refersTo="page_0823"/>It will also bring about certainty amongst employers as they will now know that they wilt no longer be able to place Bantu in specified categories of employment. I want to emphasize once again that every individual determination made, has to be tabled in this House. This is done by notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. If a determination is made in respect of any category of employment, it will be possible to discuss it in this House and call the Minister in question to account if it should have any adverse effect. This is a timely and important measure. It is a measure in respect of which I have received numerous telegrams and letters of support throughout the country. It is being welcomed as a mighty step in the right direction by the National Party towards establishing in South Africa properly regulated labour conditions as far as the Bantu are concerned, and to quash labour integration. That is what we are doing here.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to keep this Committee very much longer. I have said all that I really wanted to say. But I do want to say one or two things in reply to the hon. the Deputy Minister. He tells us that he cannot give us any real examples of racial friction caused by the employment of African typists, receptionists and counter hands but that he is stopping the cracks as they appear. He is preventing widespread racial friction. Does it not occur to the hon. the Deputy Minister that over the last 20 years there has been a tremendous transformation in the entire labour field in South Africa when so many jobs that used to be done by white people are to-day being done by African people? Does he know that there has not been any racial friction as a result thereof? There might have been times when the white trade unionists were protesting. They sooner or later gave way because the force of economic circumstances were too strong for them or because they got higher wages as a result of relinquishing certain jobs out of skilled categories and allowing them to be reclassified into semi-skilled categories. This is happening all along the line in every branch of our economy. It will happen even in the service industries which the hon. the Deputy Minister is now hoping to protect from a change which in fact has been nothing but beneficial for South Africa. I was interested to hear the hon. the Deputy Minister quoting the building industry of all things as an example of success. He could not have chosen a more unfortunate example. As a result of the Building Workers Act which prevents African skilled building workers from doing jobs in the white areas, the entire building and construction industry in South Africa is semi-paralysed. Every single major building and construction employer in the country, every single one, has uttered on this over the last year or two. They have been complaining bitterly that they cannot supply the bricklayers, plasterers, painters and electricians. And as a result of all this they cannot supply the houses that South Africans so badly need. The houses they do supply are far more expensive than they ought to be. Does this not occur to the hon. the Deputy Minister? Is he so blinkered by this overwhelming job that he is trying to do that he does not see these things? And I dare say that he too, will pass on to another portfolio, leaving some other poor man to pick up the wreckage just as his predecessor did, who having made a lot of rash predictions and promises rapidly moved off into the night before he could be called to order. This same hon. Deputy Minister is going to find all his hopes crashing in ruin about him because he is trying the impossible. He is doing a Canute. King Canute of course had enough sense to know that he could not hold back the ocean. What he tried to do was to demonstrate to his foolish followers who thought that he could hold back the ocean. This hon. Minister honestly believes that he can hold back the ocean. Fancy choosing the building industry out of all the unfortunate examples to show how successfully integration has been prevented in South Africa. That is the one thing.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister and one of the other hon. members here said that there were resolutions at their congresses asking for this. I am quite sure that congress took place before the Herstigtes walked out or were kicked out, whatever you want to call it. I am quite sure that most of those resolutions were inspired by super verkramptes of whom many hundreds of thousands are left in the Nationalist ranks. Is it not the duty of politicians and of members of Parliament to lead their people rather than to be pushed in a foolish direction by them? I remember that there was a resolution at a Nationalist congress asking for shop apartheid. No less a person than the Prime Minister himself said that thus far they could not go. He said we cannot have shop apartheid much though we may like it because what would happen if you wanted to send your black servant to the shop to buy a loaf of bread. I must admit that he did not say that we cannot have shop apartheid because it is an utterly repulsive thought anyway. No. He had to give this other rather racialists explanation. But never mind, he at least stopped this movement. Why did not the hon. the Deputy Minister stand up at the congress and tell his people who were pushing for this sort of absurd thing that it was not the sort of thing that he could possibly implement without damage to South Africa&#x2019;s economy. Because this is the case. There are not the white typists and receptionists that he wants to place in the jobs which African women are now holding. There is another point that has struck me and I wonder whether it has struck anybody else. The hon. the Minister in his Second Reading speech mentioned only three categories. He mentioned shop assistants, receptionists and typists. Those were the three categories that he has mentioned. Now he has been very careful to assure us that this is not a job reservation clause, and that he does not want to use it extensively. Not six months have <span class="col_1619-1620" refersTo="page_0824"/>passed and the hon. the Minister has already added two more categories. Did anybody notice that? This afternoon he added two more categories. He suddenly thought of African barmen and barmaids. He never mentioned those in his Second Reading speech six months ago and he never mentioned those in the White Paper.</p>

<p>Naturally, that was six months ago. Six months ago he did not think of them. Who knows what he will think of in six months&#x2019; time. And six months after that we will have categories numbering dozens. The hon. the Minister will suddenly have to stick his busy-body thumb in the cracks that are appearing. He is the little man on the dyke wall who sticks his thumb in the cracks, but unfortunately he has not got enough thumbs to fill the cracks in this particular regard. He will not be able to fill all the cracks because we have a shortage of labour in practically every single solitary occupation in South Africa. I want to make one final point. Has it ever occurred to this hon. Minister that he is in his position in order to safeguard the interests of the Africans by any chance?</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that he is very conscious of that fact. All I can say is that every single piece of legislation which has been introduced by the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, in whose tender care the destinies of millions of Africans are placed, has been a law which has been to the detriment of the people of whom they are supposed to be the guardians. Such has been the case ever since I have been a member of this House. I think it is a disgrace. The hon. the Minister comes to the House to-day with a law which is specifically aimed at throwing out of jobs decent, hard-working, competent and efficient African workers. That hon. member is the Minister of Bantu Administration, and it is a disgrace.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister made a point and I am grateful to him for bringing the debate back to the clause, apart from some wilder implications and ramifications. He made the point that any reasonable person would agree with him that this was not a job reservation clause and that it was not a clause which made the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development the commissar of the economic development of South Africa. I again want to refer to the words of the clause because I want to put to the hon. the Deputy Minister the paradox with which he is faced. The words which stand in the clause and which he has said reflect the intention under which he will act and the spirit in which the Bill will be interpreted say that the Minister may prohibit employment or continued employment of a Bantu in a specified area, in a specified class of employment, in a specified trade or in the service of a specified employer or class of employer. Any single reasonable person who looks at the power which is given to the hon. the Minister by this clause, must come to the conclusion that this is a total power. It is a total power because he can prohibit or exclude the employment of the Bantu in any one of the categories listed. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that it is intended to limit only five categories of employment.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has mentioned the five, but he has not given us an undertaking that there will not be more. We must understand that there are going to be more. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that this is being done in order to fill up the cracks. The cracks in what? The cracks in the apartheid wall; the cracks in the apartheid of labour? He pretends that this is something which is essential and vital to the continued existence of the white man and the white worker. If he says it is essential, will he tell us why he is introducing an amendment which will allow for exemptions?</p>

<p>He said the clause was introduced in order to protect the white worker. If this is to protect the white worker or to prevent social integration for the social reasons that the hon. the Deputy Minister has mentioned, why has he introduced an exemption clause? This proposal will enable him to exempt certain classes of people. If this is so vital that it has to be put into practice and that it has to be passed during this session, in spite of the urgency of the election work outside, why does this hon. Deputy Minister take powers to exempt any one of those classes of people in order that non-Whites may do a certain class of work? As the hon. the Deputy Minister sits in this House, he knows that he will not find white people to do that work. The only reason why non-Whites are being employed in that kind of employment is because there are not white people to do the work.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I am looking forward to an answer. I want to refer the hon. the Minister to the case of the Indian barmen in Durban. A great gesture was made by the hon. <span class="col_1621-1622" refersTo="page_0825"/>the Minister of Labour some years ago in order to protect the white barmen in Durban. He issued a declaration which said that in Durban the work of barmen shall only be done by white people. However, he promptly issued exemptions to every single hotel in Durban because there were very few or no white barmen in the whole of Durban. Here in this clause we again find that provision is made for the protection of white barmen. They are already covered by one of the determinations of the hon. the Minister of Labour. Why does the hon. the Deputy Minister mention barmen as one of the categories when white barmen are already covered by another provision? The hon. the Deputy Minister must not wave his paw at me; I beg your pardon, I mean the hon. the Deputy Minister must not wave his hand at me. Listening to the hon. the Deputy Minister, when he dramatically tried to prove his point, I have come to the conclusion that either this is a very real determination to take control of the total labour pattern of South Africa or &#x2026;</p>

[Interjection.] The question is relevant because the Minister says it is not only the White people who object to being served by Blacks, but the Blacks also object to being served by Whites. Now is he going to stop the White person from being served by a Black person in a shop; must the Black person then go to another shop where he can be served by a Black person, or can he be served by a White person? It is quite all right for a Black person to be served by a White person, while it is not right for a White person to be served by a Black person.</p>

[Interjection.] It is offensive, but if it is offensive for a White person to be served by_ a Black person, is it not offensive for a White person to serve a Black person? Surely it must be worse. I say that if the Government&#x2019;s policy is brought to its logical conclusion, then you must have separate shops where Black persons will be served by Black people, and White people can be served by White people.

<p></p>

<p>I should like to reply to those hon. members who have just spoken. The hon. member for Houghton made the point, and I found it very astonishing and regard it as a very irresponsible speech made by her, that the building industry was semi-paralysed in South Africa. This is an extremely irresponsible utterance, apart from the fact that what she said was absolute nonsense, because what are the facts? Last year, or rather year before last, the position was that in the building industry building plans amounting to R216.6 million were approved, and in 1969 it went up from R216.6 million to R263.6 million. Does this look like a building industry in South Africa which is semi-paralysed? Sir, I have respect for that hon. member and at times she can do her homework very well, but I have an intense aversion to the sudden fancies she sometimes takes to rise in this House and deliver herself of extremely irresponsible things which are blazened forth in countries abroad and are very detrimental to South Africa. The same applies to this point she made. That is not fair. And then she made another very irresponsible statement on which it would be possible for me to comment very sharply, for the very reason that that hon. Minister and myself and my department well and truly have the interests of the Bantu in this country at heart, since we regard it as our task and calling to ensure that racial harmony and racial peace prevail in this country. And it is not by chance that such racial harmony prevails in South Africa; it is because we, in our modest way, do our work properly, and I can only speak very highly of my officials for the way in which this has come about. We must also pay tribute to the thousands of officials who are employed by the municipalities and who are in the forefront as regards bringing about that racial harmony. But then the hon. member disparages this work by making the statement that all that hon. Minister and I have been able to do since she became a member of this House, has been to introduce here &#x201C;abhorrent Bills&#x201D; which are allegedly to the detriment of and damaging to the Bantu in this country. I want to tell the hon. member that I believe in this work which I pm doing in the Office I hold. I believe in the principle of separate development, and I find it a sheer pleasure to do this work, and I also find it a pleasure to be at the head of this development as far as the Bantu are concerned; and as this is such a pleasure and as it is so essential and important, and as one can really realize oneself in this work, I have no doubt that in this regard the seventies will bring to pass a very great deal of progress in the Republic, and that is why I loathe that kind of remark that was made by the hon. member.</p>

<p>Then she made a third point. She said that six months ago I had come forward here with three categories in respect of which clause 11 allegedly applied, and now I had come forward with five. That is quite correct. In the White Paper and in my Second Reading speech last year I referred to three, and now I refer for five. Which two did I add? One of them was barmaids and barmen and the other one I added was telephonists. And why? This explains&#x2014;and I am grateful to the hon. member for having raised that point&#x2014;why the wording in clause 11 reads as it does. You should not think that we did not discuss this wording very fully with the legal advisors. We do not want to create impressions which are not true, and <span class="col_1625-1626" refersTo="page_0827"/>we do not want to harm the country. I am not here to harm the economy of the country or to disturb racial harmony; I am here to benefit the economy and to promote racial harmony, and not to harm them, and my deeds ought to prove this to them. But for the very reason that it is not possible for me, and much less the hon. the Minister, to give the undertaking that these five categories I mentioned, will for the future be the only categories of employment in respect of which it will be necessary to put a stop to labour integration, and not to come to this House with a new law every time, but to make a law enabling us to do, in a proper and effective manner, what has to be done, it has been worded this way, and this explains why I had three at that time and why I now have five. But I want to ask those hon. members how many Bantu they think will be affected by the addition of bar assistants and telephonists. That is why I devoted my Second Reading speech last year to the fact that the Opposition was conjuring up spectres in regard to this Bill and this clause, and there is literal proof for this in every step-for-step discussion we have had at this Committee Stage up to now.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Mooi River said this clause was &#x201C;to protect the White worker&#x201D;. He said this was what I had allegedly said, but I never said that. In fact, I did explain that section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act sought to put a stop to competition in the sphere of labour. It deals with job reservation. I said this repeatedly, as you will see in Hansard, and this afternoon I once again said it here, i.e. that this is not a work reservation clause. I have repeatedly said that the object of this clause is to put a stop to labour integration, and I gave chapter and verse in order to prove to the Committee that its object was to put a stop to labour integration. Now I ask him where he gets this from, i.e. that I ever made the statement that this clause was &#x201C;to protect the White workers&#x201D;? This is not the case. As I have explained repeatedly, the one and only point at issue here is to put a stop to labour integration in the categories of employment which I mentioned and in the others which may be added, and no more. Then there is his statement in regard to Indian barmen. It was done by the Department of Labour at that time, not in respect of each and every hotel there, as he said, but only in respect of a few hotels, and it was only done as a temporary measure, because Whites could not be found to do that work. [Interjections.] And as far as the Department of Labour is concerned&#x2014;the Secretary for Labour is sitting here and he assures me that this is the case&#x2014;there has never been any question of forbidding, in terms of section 77, Bantu to work behind counters, because of the fact I explained here to hon. members a moment ago, i.e. that it is too cumbersome to do so in terms of section 77. I think I have now replied to all the questions.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Our original clause 11, as you will recall, did not contain those exemptions, but because of the newspaper reports which appeared about this clause, various organizations&#x2014;the names of which I could mention but shall refrain from mentioning since this matter is not so important&#x2014;throughout the country came to see us and had interviews with us on this clause. For instance, the Johannesburg City Council and the Chamber of Commerce and various other organizations came to sec us. What did they want? At the suggestion of various of those organizations, i.e. that provision should be made here for granting exemption if, on merit, truly sound reasons could be advanced as to why an exemption would be justified if in a category of employment this determination were issued, we thought&#x2014;since we wanted to cause satisfaction as far as possible &#x2014;that it would be wise to accommodate those people and to make that concession to them so that, if necessary, are might see once again whether, on merit, a substantial case could not be made out for it, and it is for this, and no other reason, that we introduced this amendment. It was done to satisfy those people and, by these means, to cope with the terrible way in which this clause has been described in the newspapers and used as a deterrent.

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>This clause is partly consequential and partly introduces a new principle. Sir, the new subclause (viii) which is being introduced here is consequential upon the clause which we have just dealt with, and this allows the Officer in charge of a labour bureau to cancel the employment contract of any Bantu who has been prohibited from performing a certain job in terms of the new section 20A which it is proposed to introduce. The new subclause (ix) has the effect that a district or municipal labour Officer may refuse to sanction the employment or the continued employment of any Bantu; he can also cancel or cause to be cancelled any contract of employment entered into with such Bantu if he is satisfied that adequate housing accommodation is not available to such Bantu. Let me say at once that we on this side of the House realize the necessity for influx control. We realize that you cannot allow people to come into the urban areas to work if there is no accommodation available to them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I hope that the Department of the hon. the Minister is not going to use this provision to keep people out merely because accommodation has not been provided. I want to repeat the point that I made earlier, that I consider it is the responsibility of the local authority concerned and of the Government to provide suitable and adequate accommodation for these people. But I also want to remind the hon. the Deputy Minister of steps which have been taken by this Government for the provision of accommodation for non-white employees by employers in so-called white areas. Sir, I have here a circular (ref. No. G.8/16/5) of the 20th August, 1965, issued by the Department of Community Development. It is addressed to all local authorities and regional representatives and begins as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The department has on various occasions been approached by employers of large numbers of Coloured, Indian and even Bantu employees with the request that they themselves be permitted to provide accommodation for the non-white employees in the latter&#x2019;s group area.</block>

<p>It then goes on to set out the circumstances under which the Government will allow employers to provide accommodation for their employees and it reads: &#x201C;The pattern which was followed in the few instances to date is to the advantage of the local authority and to the advantage of the employees concerned.&#x201D; They then quote a case in the Cape where one employer has erected plus-minus 60 houses for his non-white employees and another one in Pretoria who had received authority to proceed on a basis similar to the others, as laid down in this circular. The concluding portion of the circular reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The department would accordingly like to recommend to local authorities to make full use of the opportunity of rendering active assistance to large employers of labour where such employers are of a different racial group to that of their employees and thus precluded from owning land in the latter&#x2019;s group areas but who are prepared to provide housing themselves for their employees by making land available to such employers as outlined above.</block>

<p>Sir, here we have this new provision, which we have not had up to now. The Officer in charge of a labour bureau has not been allowed to refuse to register a Bantu for employment nor has he been allowed to cancel the contract of employment purely on the ground that there is insufficient accommodation available. We now have this new principle introduced, and I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to see to it that local authorities undertake their duty and that they provide sufficient and adequate housing for Bantu employed there, and, furthermore, to use his influence with the hon. the Minister of Community Development to see to it that the National Housing Commission makes adequate funds available to the local authorities at a low rate of interest to enable them to carry out his plans and, thirdly, to act in terms of this instruction of April, 1965, to encourage employers where possible to provide adequate accommodation for their employees, so that we will not have a situation developing where numbers of Bantu will be deprived of their employment because of the unavailability of adequate housing for them.</p>

<p>Sir, I want everybody to know that I am on the side of neither the hon. the Deputy Minister nor the hon. member who has just spoken. I do not know what he means by adequate housing; I do not think he has explained himself. Adequate housing, in terms of the Nationalist Party policy, is hostel housing, not housing on a family basis at all in the prescribed areas. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will admit that. He is making it extremely difficult, and the National Housing Commission and Government loans are not easily available to the municipal authorities for the provision of housing on a family basis. I do not know whether it is the policy of the United Party to make provision for housing in the urban areas. Do they make provision for hostel accommodation?</p>

<p>Well then, why are the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) suddenly in such complete agreement on this question of housing? It is very extraordinary, because the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) knows perfectly well that the Government, in terms of its policy, does not intend to provide housing in the urban areas on a family basis at all. They aim to provide hostel accommodation, single accommodation for married people who then have to send their children away back to the homelands. This is certainly not the sort of accommodation I would support. Furthermore, this clause obviously gives the Minister greater powers for the cancellation of existing contracts, and there are considerable consequences which follow from that. The consequences are in terms of an earlier measure passed by this House, which makes the endorsement out of people already in jobs a much easier matter, because if no accommodation is available, this is one of the factors whereby these people can be endorsed out. I am against this clause.</p>

<p>Sir, the purpose of the amendment to this section is to make an employer liable to pay a monthly rate in respect of a woman employee as well as in respect of a male employee. At the moment an employer pays only in respect of male Bantu employees. The object of this clause is to make that payment applicable to women employees as well. We are opposed to that. We say this is going to be an added hardship on the housewives who want to employ Bantu women. It will merely mean that their cost of living will go up further because they will have to pay the additional rate. We say that this is quite unfair. It is part of the Government&#x2019;s policy, I suppose, to make it as difficult for housewives as possible to employ Bantu women. That is contrary to our concept, and therefore we shall oppose this added burden on the Native women which this clause will effect.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to support all that the hon. member for Transkei said, but I want to add another point. Why is it that the hon. the Deputy Minister is making it more difficult for the housewives of South Africa to obtain domestic employees? I think one will find that 95% plus of the domestics employed in South Africa are females. Up to now the housewife, in order to register the employment of a Bantu female, has had to report once to the labour Office, which is very often situated at the other end of town, to have the contract of employment registered. All she had to do was to pay a fee which covered her until such time as the employee left her employment. Now we have the situation where, because of this minor amendment, namely the deletion of one word, &#x201C;male,&#x201D; every housewife in South Africa is going to have to go to the labour bureau once a month at considerable inconvenience and considerable expense to pay 20 cents in respect of her domestic servant. Why is it that the hon. the Deputy Minister is making it more difficult for the housewives of South Africa? Surely the hon. the Deputy Minister must have known that, with the election coming up, this is one way of losing the votes of the housewives of South Africa. Sir, I do not think that <span class="col_1631-1632" refersTo="page_0830"/>20 cents per month for the general revenue funds of the various local authorities is so important that we can cause this disruption to the housewives of South Africa.</p>

<p>There is another aspect as well. Has the hon. the Deputy Minister enough staff in his department, where this is administered, and have the local authorities got the staff to cope with this added influx of work they will now have to cope with? Most of these labour bureaus are really dreadfully understaffed. They are dreadfully overworked. They have a mass of regulations which they have to interpret and apply. Here we have something which I consider to be completely unnecessary. It is an inconvenience to the housewives and female Bantu employees, and it involves unnecessary extra work with which the labour bureau will have to cope.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the position in connection with this clause is that fundamentally the 20 cents per month that will have to be paid by the housewives who do have domestic servants will to be to the advantage of those very housewives. Hon. members will readily concede that 20 cents per month is not much. It is negligible. Hon. members may ask why this is going to be to the advantage of the housewives, and ultimately, to the advantage of all concerned, including the Bantu. I shall explain the advantages of this, and at the same time I shall reply to the second question put by the hon. member when he asked whether we had the necessary staff for administering this. The advantage is that the funds which will be collected in this way will be used to employ additional inspectors at the labour bureaux, on a local territorial basis, so as to enable those labour bureaux to do so much more efficient work. That is the position. As hon. members know, the labour bureaux exist to bring employers and employees together. As far as this is concerned, the public does not always realize the very important function our labour bureaux are fulfilling. If this had been realized more fully, also by the housewives, there would most certainly have been fewer unregistered and so-called illegal Bantu in our White prescribed areas. Actually the provision for the payment of this amount of 20 cents has been kept in obeyance for a long time. Consequently it will give rise to the advantages I explained to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District).</p>

<p>Perhaps I should just tell this House as a matter of interest that, according to what I was told after I had made enquiries, the 20 cents which will have to be paid by the Bantu women will, in a city like Pretoria, bring in something like R5.500 per month. In a city like Johannesburg it will bring in an amount of approximately R30,000, in round figures, per month. Hon. members will notice that these amounts are not really very considerable. However, it will nevertheless be an important contribution in the interests,of the labour bureaux.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to (Official Opposition and Mrs. H. Suzman dissenting).</p>

<p>Clause 15:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have a number of objections to this clause. Indeed, I think that after clause 11, it is the most important and the most objectionable clause in this Bill. I object to both paragraphs (a) and (b). The first part is of course introduced to try to rationalize the labour supply. From this point of view I can understand the hon. the Deputy Minister attempting to supply employers of labour, including building employers, with a more readily available and constant supply of labour. He is also hoping thereby to be able to reduce the number of additional labourers who have to come into the area, because he is hoping that there will be a transference of redundant labour to the next employer, who may at that time be requiring additional labour. In this way he hopes to keep down the overall number of labourers coming into the area. I object to the whole principle of labour being recruited in this fashion, because it does have the effect of keeping down competition and it does mean that there is a tendency for wages to be kept lower. If we had a really efficient system of minimum wages in South Africa based on an appreciation of the rising cost of living and an appreciation of the basic necessities of life, below which employees could not be taken on by employers. I would not object to this provision. We have had examples of recruited labour in other spheres, and there is no doubt that the very existence of the recruiter has had the effect of keeping down the wage level. So, from that point of view, Sir, I do not approve of clause 15 (a).</p>

<p>Paragraph (b) has very far reaching consequences indeed. In terms of the proviso to paragraph (u), which is going to be deleted in terms of clause 15 (b), the African migratory worker is going to lose the right that he has, as of right, to return to the same employer within a year, should he leave the urban area and return home. That is the effect of the proviso to paragraph (u), which is now going to be deleted. I want the hon. the Deputy Minister to know, as he must surely know, that this is a right which is deeply treasured by the migratory African worker. It gives him some security to know that he can go home, visit his family in the Reserves, and return to the same employer as of right. What is more, if that employer has already taken on some other employee in his place, he may be allowed to remain in the urban area to seek work. That is, of course, permissive. That is not a right, but it does exist in law and it is therefore frequently observed by the officials of the department. Perhaps I should say at this stage that all my sympathies are with the officials of the department, who have to administer these laws. I do not criticize the officials. When I earlier criticized the hon. the Deputy Minister and his senior Minister, I was not including the <span class="col_1633-1634" refersTo="page_0831"/>officials. I want to make that quite clear. My sympathies are with them because they have to carry out and administer the unworkable laws that are so blithely passed by this Parliament.</p>

<p>I doubt whether the hon. the Deputy Minister visits them as often as I do. Anyway, let us leave that to one side. The point is that this right, in terms of paragraph (u) of the existing law, is now being removed. I know that the Deputy Minister has told us that he is taking this right away because it is no longer necessary, since he is introducing the call-in card system. I understand that that is the explanation he gave. He said that under the call-in card system, the African who leaves his employer, will be able to return to his homeland and, by virtue of being in possession of a call-in card, he will have the right to return. Now there are many difficulties in regard to this call-in card system which I should like to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister. First of all. it is valid only for a month, so that the employee who goes home has to be traced by his employer, who then sends him a call-in card, if he can find him. I want to know how many employers keep <b>adequate</b> addresses of their African migratory employees. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, for instance there are thousands upon thousands of unclaimed amounts in the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund for one reason only, and that is the employers do not have any idea of where to find their employees. They not only do not know their home addresses, but they do not know their surnames either. They are John or Philemon and so on. Nobody ever knows the surname of the African employee. nor his address. I want the hon. the Deputy Minister to tell me how this call-in card system is actually going to work in practice because under this system we are going to have this vast turnover of migratory workers visiting their homes and returning again, trying to find their old employers and their old employers trying to trace them.</p>

<p>No, it is not already working. I asked the hon. the Minister a question in this regard and he did not know the answer. I have that question here somewhere. He said that he could not tell me in which areas this system, although I cannot really call it a system, was functioning properly. He said that he would need a proper survey to be able to tell me. But long before the hon. the Minister knows whether his system is functioning properly and long before any survey has been properly carried out, he does away with an existing right without ensuring that the administrative procedures for what is replacing the existing system are going to function properly. What sort of organization is this and what sort of effect will it have in practice? From the moment this law is promulgated the right that thousands of Africans think they enjoy, disappears. They then have to go on to a call-in card system which I do not suppose one employer in ten has ever heard of or knows how to operate. You can be sure that not one African employee in a thousand has heard of the call-in system. Who administers it? The headmen in the tribal areas have to administer it. How many such headmen have been trained to operate a proper call-in card system? Surely the hon. the Minister cannot be serious when he tells me this afternoon that this system is functioning properly already. I find that almost impossible to believe. I do not know how these tribal headmen have been instructed and I am sure that the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot tell me because he could not answer the question I put to him.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I actually put a question to him in this regard during this year. The point is that I cannot believe that this call-in card system is now functioning smoothly throughout the tribal areas. Why is there such a hurry in regard to this matter? Why can the hon. the Minister not let the system operate for another few years so that the difficulties can be ironed out by trial and error before he forces this measure through Parliament? I really do implore the hon. the Minister to do this. I have tried shouting at him but that does not work. I am now imploring him not to go ahead with the deletion of this subsection until he is absolutely sure that the system is working <span class="col_1635-1636" refersTo="page_0832"/>smoothly. I do not think he appreciates how much store the migratory African labourer sets by this particular right to come back to his previous employer and know that his job has been kept for him. It is very important and I foresee long lines of unemployed Africans queueing up in front of headmen who do not have the faintest idea of what they are really doing but who have to collect fees. Many of them are in any case probably not fully literate and they have to operate this most complicated call-in card system which has now been gazetted. I have here the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 3rd January, 1969, in which this measure was promulgated; it is very complicated. One needs to be fairly well trained to understand how the system is going to function. I want to say again what I said earlier on when we discussed the call-in card system. I think that it is disgraceful that the one person who should know what he is involving himself in, i.e. the labourer, the employee, is not given a copy of the contract of service. He is the only person who is excluded. The employer, the tribal authority and the Bantu Administration Office all get a copy but there is nothing in the law Which makes it necessary for the labourer himself, the employee, to have a copy of the contract of labour under which he is hiring himself out.

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are faced here with amendments to section 28 of the principal Act. Section 28 empowers the State President to make regulations, not inconsistent with the Act. about all or any of a number of matters. Clause 15 (a) provides for the substitution of paragraph (f) of subsection (1) and deals with the formation of groups of employers which in the past has been limited to those employers of Bantu who are engaged in agriculture. We on this side of the House feel that this is merely an extension of a principle which has already been adopted. The principle was adopted with regard to agriculture and now it is being extended to other spheres of the economy. We will therefore not oppose that particular part of the clause.</p>

<p>I now come to paragraph (b) of this clause which provides for &#x201C;the deletion of the proviso to paragraph (u) of the said subsection&#x201D;. Paragraph (u) of section 28 of the Act states that the State President may make regulations as to:</p>

<block name="quote">(u) the management and control of labour bureaux; the powers, duties and functions of Officers appointed for the management or control of any such bureau &#x2026;</block>

<p>All this is set out in great length in the Act as it stands at present, but added at the end there is a proviso which reads as follows;</p>

<block name="quote">provided that a Bantu shall not under any regulation made in terms of this paragraph be refused permission to re-enter an area after an absence therefrom of not more than 12 months, for the purpose of taking up employment, if a vacancy exists, with the employer by whom such Bantu was last employed in such area before leaving such area, or, if such vacancy has ceased to exist, and if the Bantu Affairs Commissioner has no objection, with any other employer in such area.</block>

<p>In terms of this proviso a right was bestowed upon the Bantu and here I agree with the hon. member for Houghton. But not only was a right bestowed upon the Bantu, there was also a right bestowed upon the employer. An employer derived from this proviso the right to say at any time within one year: &#x201C;That Bantu was employed by me and I want him to come back and work for me. I have spent considerable time and money in training him. He is someone who knows my business. He is one on whom I depend to run my business.&#x201D; I place particular emphasis on the latter sentence: &#x201C;He is someone on whom I depend to run my business and I want him back.&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, I know that you will not allow me to repeat all the arguments raised by the hon. member for Houghton in favour of the Bantu. I agree with the arguments raised by her.</p>

<p>I am afraid I do not know. After I came back from overseas at the beginning of this year I made enquiries in this regard and this is the result of my enquiries. I admit that they were made hurriedly but I found both extremes as far as the operation of this system is concerned. The point I want to make is that even if the call-in card system does work, this does not become a right. It does not mean to say that if an employer signs a card <span class="col_1637-1638" refersTo="page_0833"/>and says that he wants his employee back at the end of June, that he will get him back as of right because if this amendment to delete the proviso to paragraph (u) is accepted, that right will be removed. The call-in card system might work in practice but the employer will no longer have the right to get his employee back and the Bantu will no longer have the right to go back to his employer. For that reason I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very grateful to the Opposition for supporting paragraph (a) of this clause. I therefore do not want to elaborate very much on this now. The hon. member for Houghton does not support it. I am quite amazed that she does not do so. I think the reason she does not support it in this case is not any ideological one. I honestly think it is because she did not have a good look at what this labour pool really involves. She made what was to my mind a very surprising statement here, namely that this measure would not be to the benefit of that labour. For my own edification I drew up a list here of about 10, 11 benefits which we in fact think will result from this labour pool. I want to mention them quickly. I do not want to take up much time with them. These benefits will be: (1) the retention of Bantu for a specific category of work; (2) the elimination of official intervention; (3) more intimate employer-employee relations; (4) increased and improved utilization through elimination of lay-off periods; (5) greater mobility of labour within that area and within that category of workers in the same pool; (6) promotion of improved conditions of service within that industry for example, food, transport, housing, hours of service and wages could improve. When people pool together much better conditions of service can be offered to the workers, and surely the hon. member will know this, than a small hotel or builder for example can afford his workers. In this way I can mention many examples. I am therefore surprised at the hon. member&#x2019;s statement. A seventh benefit is the elimination of labour being lured away from the same type of industry. The eighth benefit is that as far as the labour pool is concerned illegal employment will be reduced and can be stopped entirely. The ninth benefit is that it will become easier to comply with departmental requirements, such as reporting of service. The tenth benefit is that a register of undesirable, or of proficiency can be kept up to date, which will be conducive to improve utilization of Bantu labour. Therefore, Sir, there are very considerable benefits, believe us, in regard to the labour pool. I honestly think the hon. member for Houghton did not do her homework well enough in regard to this point, because the only point she mentioned is that this would eliminate labour competition. I cannot concede that point to her either. I must say that it will not be easy for her to make out a case against these 10 powerful benefits which I mentioned to her here.</p>

<p>The next point she mentioned is in connection with the call-in card system. I have now dealt with paragraph (a), for the Opposition supports it and the hon. member for Houghton is the only one opposed to it. As far as paragraph (b) is concerned, I just want to say to the hon. member for Houghton first that the position is that according to our information the Bantu in the mines are very pleased with the call-in card system. The second point she made was not correct&#x2014;and I can understand why she made this point; but the fact still remains that she was not correct&#x2014;is that these call-in cards are only valid for one month. That is not correct. On page 2 of the document, which I have in my hand, in the second paragraph from the bottom, they talk about &#x201C;one month&#x201D;. Is that where the hon. member gets the information from? Then I can reply to her very quickly in this regard. This is merely a <i>pro forma</i> statement which is being made here. The position is that the employer can change at will that period of one month for the Bantu worker employed by him, but not for longer than 12 months. That is very clear. The hon. member can now accept my word for that. I expected this to be discussed. I have it here in my hand, because I thought it could give rise to misunderstanding. This is only a <i>pro forma</i> statement and it is not correct to accept that the period is only one month.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I am making it very clear that it is only <i>pro forma</i>. Within the space of 12 months the employer is given no time limit as far as the call-in cards are concerned. That is very clear.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton asked one last question to which I want to reply before I deal briefly with this entire question of the call-in card system, as well as the deletion of paragraph (u) with hon. members. She asked how many of these call-in cards have now been issued. As a result of ordinary practical circumstances and administrative problems I cannot furnish her with the precise number, but I can give her the assurance that thousands of call-in cards have already been issued in South Africa. It surprised me that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) should say this afternoon that there are places where this does not work. I must concede to him that he did make the point that in general it was working very well. When I asked him how long the call-in card system had been in force there, he was not certain. I want to invite the hon. member to come and tell me in private where these places are. I shall then go into it immediately. Our information is that the system is working <span class="col_1639-1640" refersTo="page_0834"/>very well as every place we know about. If I explain to the hon. member now what this comprises, he will see why there can be no reasons, of which I am aware, why the system should not work properly.</p>

<p>Now I should also like to make very clear a point made by the United Party in regard to the deletion of paragraph (u). We do not think that that paragraph gives the Bantu any right. What does paragraph (u) deal with? This paragraph provides that the Labour Bureau cannot refuse its consent to a Bantu who wants to return to his employer after an absence of less than a year. This implies very clearly, also in terms of legal advice obtained in regard to this matter, that there must therefore in fact be an application to the Labour Bureau for such employment. This does not imply therefore that a Bantu can simply, of his own accord, without the knowledge of the Labour Bureau, return to his former employer in the hope that he will find work there. What right is it now which is therefore at issue? I consequently find myself in the position that I cannot in any way agree with the hon. member for Houghton, or with any other person who argues as if this is a right. The position in practice, as well as according to what legal advisors have told us, is that the Bantu must go to the Labour Bureau in any case, in spite of paragraph (u). If the Labour Bureau does not give him the necessary leave to go to his former employer, then he cannot go. Consequently what right are the Bantu losing here? We think therefore that the Bantu are not losing any right whatsoever here. If hon. members are able to convince me to the contrary, I shall be quite open to conviction. I went into this matter very thoroughly and I can assure hon. members that there is nothing that I reject so much as that the feeling should exist that we are now rescinding rights here. This we do not want to do at all. If we are forced to rescind rights, it is only if we are convinced that we can put something better in their place. As I said earlier this afternoon we have the interests of the Bantu at heart and we want to maintain good relations here. Now I want to tell hon. members what the call-in card system really involves, and why we believe the system will work very well. There are two sorts of cases with which one has to deal in regard to the call-in card system. I do not think the hon. member for Houghton has a good understanding of this whole matter. I am saying this in all honesty. I began to realize this when she spoke in the Second Reading debate, as well as the other night on the motion. There are two types of Bantu which one has to deal with in regard to the call-in card system. This will interest hon. members in general because it is something with which they will have to deal in practice.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p></p>

<p>I shall furnish the hon. member with the regulation number in just a moment. I have done this on a previous occasion, but I shall furnish it to him again with the greatest pleasure. I shall try to explain it as simply as possible to hon. members. There are two categories of Bantu with which we have to deal in regard to the call-in card system. The one category is the Bantu in service with his employer who has reached the end of his contract period of 12 months in terms of which he <i>must</i> return to his homeland for a period which must not exceed 12 months. It is not specified when such a Bantu need return within that period of 12 months; the period must simply not exceed 12 months. What is the position now with the call-in card in regard to that category? In the first place, the employer and the Bantu working for him reach an agreement as to when that Bantu should like to take employment again with that employer. Such a Bantu must just not stay away from his employer and work for longer than 12 months. In the second place, the employer obtains a call-in card from the Labour Officer and he has this certified to the effect that the Bantu who is now employed by him is (a) registered and legally employed by him, (b) that he has accommodation available for the Bantu and (c) in the case of the Western Cape&#x2014;and only in the case of the Western Cape&#x2014;that Coloured labour is not available. Hon. members will see that so far it is still very easy for both the employer and the employee to act according to this system. The third step is that the call-in card, after it has been certified by the Labour Bureau, is handed over to the Bantu worker and he displays that card on the pre-arranged day, when he wants to return to his employer, at his tribal labour bureau where the new period of employment contract is attested. He then pays R1 in labour fees for that. That is all that takes place between the employer and the employee. The tribal labour bureau will then inform the other labour bureau, and when such a Bantu is again working for his employer, he will be legally registered by the local labour bureau. The system is therefore very simple and there is absolutely no reason why it should not work. I do not want to wax eloquent now on the advantages of the call-in card system; it is nevertheless very clear that there are a tremendous number of advantages attached to this call-in card system. Firstly, in this way unnecessary, so-called red tape is completely eliminated. Secondly, the employer-employee relationship can be a very close one and it will be possible for it to last the lifetime of such a Bantu or his employer. This, is also in fact the intention with the introduction of the call-in card system. This will enable the employer to train his Bantu worker so that he can, to an increasing extent, enjoy the improved service of that Bantu worker. Such an employer can keep a Bantu, in uninterrupted continuous service with him for 10, 20 or 30 years by means of a simple procedure. He and <span class="col_1641-1642" refersTo="page_0835"/>his Bantu employee must reach an agreement, and that Bantu must obtain a call-in card from his labour bureau. The Bantu can then take such a certified call-in card with him to his homeland and can in this way return to his employer.</p>

<p>That right exists under the present Act, does it not?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I am being charged that in place of paragraph (u) we are depriving them of a right, which I do not concede, and in reality we are putting in its place a very positive measure. For the information of hon. members I am just explaining what this measure is. Lastly, there is also a fourth category of Bantu, namely the Bantu who have already left their employers and who would then like to return to their old employers. In respect of them the procedure is equally simple. The only proviso is that such Bantu must return to their old employers within the space of 12 months. All that those Bantus have to do is to obtain a call-in card, and this can be done in one of the following ways. He can obtain it from his tribal labour bureau when he is in the homeland; he can also obtain it from a labour bureau if he is in a prescribed area. The Bantu&#x2019;s employer to whose service he wants to return can also obtain a call-in card for him if the Bantu writes him a letter stating that he should like be employed by him again. In such a case this same simple machinery comes into operation to supply such a Bantu with a call-in card, which is then proof that he can return to his employer without interference from any red tape.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind that this call-in card system is a very positive and a major improvement, as hon. members opposite as well as the hon. member for Houghton have already admitted. According to our information the Bantu who are already making use of the call-in card system and who have therefore become acquainted with it, are very pleased with the system. If we find that the system can be improved here and there or that some point can be eliminated, I now promise that we will do everything in our power to eliminate or to improve it immediately.</p>

<p>I just want to give the hon. member this reference which he asked me about. It is &#x201C;Bantu Labour Regulations, 1965, Chapter VIII. Regulation 21/4 and directives from the Director of Bantu Labour contained in labour information circular 16/-&#x2019;69.&#x201D; Since we have now apparently come to the end of the Committee discussion, I want to express my gratitude to hon. members opposite for having made the discussion so much easier.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must admit that I want to associate myself with what the hon the Deputy Minister has said, namely that it is pleasant to have come to the end of this debate in which we have discussed something positive and in which we have tried to meet each other. I agree wholeheartedly with everything the hon. the Deputy Minister has said in connection with this call-in card system, because it can work.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I can agree with all the hon. the Deputy Minister has said in regard to the call-in card system. I would like, however, to put something right for the sake of the record, and that is that I never alleged that no application was necessary under the proviso to paragraph (u). I agree that an application is necessary. That proviso gave Bantu the right to go back and also gave employers the right to take a former employee back into employment. When I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister the authority for this system, I knew all about the regulations that have been issued. A regulation is, however, issued under an authority, and an authority is given under some law or other. There must be some statute or other which gives the department the authority to issue this regulation under which this particular system has been introduced. Is the authority for this system not this proviso? Is this particular proviso, which the hon. the Deputy Minister has now moved to delete, the authority for this very system? In terms of this proviso no Bantu shall under any regulation be refused permission to re-enter an area after an absence of not more than 12 months for the purpose of taking up employment with his previous employer. I want to put it to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he can accept our amendment, retain this proviso and still retain his call-in card system. I want to put it to him that it would be better to retain both the proviso and his call-in card system from the point of view of both the Bantu and the employer. I want to put a hypothetical case to him which might be extreme, but being a hypothetical case it will illustrate my question.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if a Bantu has received a call-in card from his employer, and is for some reason or other due to ignorance on the part of an official, refused permission to return to his employer, if the proviso to paragraph (u) is deleted, has that Bantu or the employer any legal right of appeal? I would submit that they would Have no legal right of appeal should the proviso be <span class="col_1643-1644" refersTo="page_0836"/>deleted. This proviso gives a right both to the employee and the employer to take the matter further. If the Bantu is refused permission to return, either the employer or the employee can go to court, and can obtain an order of the court overriding that official who has refused to give the permission for his return. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister in this time when we are removing more and more rights from more and more people in this country, to leave this proviso. It will not interfere with his system. In fact, I maintain it supports and is complementary to his call-in card system. I appeal to him to accept our amendment to delete paragraph (b), in other words, to retain in the Act the proviso to paragraph (u).</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should very much like to do this, but it is not sensible and not the right thing to do what the hon. member has just asked me to do. I can explain to him why it cannot be done. Paragraph (u) without the call-in card system has already caused a measure of confusion. Why? It has caused confusion because some people assumed that it was a right they had, while in fact it is no right at all. Now innocent Bantu are being given the impression that they have a right here. What happens in practice? They are told that the Act allows them to return to their former employer and that nobody can refuse them that. I have already explained that in practice this is not true. In order to return to his former employer he must do so through his labour bureau. If he is a tribal Bantu then he must do so through his tribal labour bureau. I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member because I think it is quite imprudent, because what is happening now in practice? Such an innocent Bantu would then return to his former employer. In the meantime, however, his former employer has employed someone else or he does not need him any more. Then the Bantu finds himself in that area illegally and before long in gaol. And that is what that hon. member and other hon. members of the Opposition are opposing all the time and what the newspapers are always publishing long reports about. We want to try to prevent this as far as possible. Here is one brilliant method which we want to bring into operation in order to try to prevent that kind of situation. If such a Bantu should now return, happily under the impression that he has a right which he, so help me, does not have, and he is not employed by his former employer, he is here illegally; the police pick him up and consequently he becomes a burden to the State. Is that what the hon. member wants now? Hon. members must not think that I did not spend a long time thinking about and mulling this matter over, and that I did not give my serious attention to it. I did that. I should very much have liked to have complied with that hon. members request. If he had an argument, I would not have hesitated to do so. However, I cannot do so because it would be imprudent and unfair towards the Bantu, and because it would create a Babel-like confusion among the Bantu, The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) himself admitted how very well this call-in card system was working, and the hon. member for Houghton will still find how very well it is working. I explained here this afternoon how simply it actually works. We already have this call-in card system, which is simple, which has proved that it can work, and in connection with which several thousand cards have already been issued. It really cannot be expected of me to retain, together with this call-in card system, another measure which has caused considerable bother and confusion. I am very sorry, but that is why I cannot do so.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In regard to the question that was put to me, I can only say that section 28 (1) (u) without the proviso, will still be wide enough to authorize this call-in card system. Therefore, we will have no legal problems whatsoever, in that connection. We have gone into the matter and that is the reply given to us by the legal advisers. I think I have now dealt with all the points raised by that hon. member. I hope that I have convinced him and that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I feel that I have made a case that these two can run concurrently, that the proviso which gives the rights, can run concurrently with the call-in card system which has put it into practice. All that the call-in card system has done is that it put the provisions of that proviso into practice.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this House adjourned on 12th February, I had pointed out certain objections which the Opposition had raised, although it supported the principle of the Bill. It is a pity that the hon. member for Musgrave was sent out of the House this afternoon, because I should have liked to reply to certain of his objections. It is a fact that there has been tremendous economic growth in our country over the past years. The National Party deserves all the praise for that, because had it not been for this party, we would not have had this economic growth and prosperity. As a result of this economic growth, we have to contend with a shortage of trained manpower to some extent. This is a problem which we must not over-emphasize or exaggerate. The utilization of non-white manpower which is advocated by the hon. member for Hillbrow is not the only solution to meet that shortage. In the first place, this Bill is chiefly aimed at making provision for training schemes by organized industry with its existing industrial systems which have already been proved over the years. In the second place, it must also be noted that section 48 of the Act, which provides for the enforceability of industrial agreements, is being amended. The measure to which the hon. member for Musgrave referred and which was submitted by the Opposition last year, was a loose piece of legislation which hung in the air; it was not well-founded. It contained no enforceable provisions. This is the basic and a very important difference between the Bill before this House to-day and that which the Opposition submitted last year.</p>

<p>Yes, but it contains no enforceable provisions whatever. It is a loose piece of legislation.</p>

<p>The measure is also aimed at introducing a levy system in respect of training schemes. This levy system too will be compulsory, and will result in those employers who have never been prepared themselves to undertake training, or who have not been prepared to contribute financially towards the training of manpower, having to do their rightful share in future as far as the training of manpower in our country is concerned. The industrialist who has always merely bid on the labour market, and who has been enticing people away from the State and the public sector, which have provided the training, will in future have to do his rightful share.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this amending Bill will result in its being possible for agreements entered into by parties to be made applicable, in the first place, to the same industry in its own area over which such an industrial council has jurisdiction, and in the second place to the same <span class="col_1647-1648" refersTo="page_0838"/>industry in an additional area where such an industrial council has no jurisdiction. In this connection I want to give a very simple example. Let us first take the case where the industrial council has jurisdiction over a certain area. Let us take the building industry in the Transvaal, which exercises jurisdiction over the whole of the Transvaal. However, there are nevertheless building industrialists who are not parties to that agreement or to an industrial council agreement. The Act can now be made applicable to those parties as well. As a second example, we can take the building industry of the Transvaal. Suppose they put for-word a training scheme for bricklayers, for example. Now it will be possible to extend that agreement to the same industry, for example in the Port Elizabeth area, over which the industrial council has no jurisdiction. In terms of clause 2 (a) of this Bill, agreements can also be made applicable to another industry in another area. In this way we obtain coverage over organized industries in the different categories.;</p>

<p>Another important aspect of this legislation is that the system of collective bargaining which forms the basis of our existing legislation, is being retained. Each industry is in a much better position to judge what its labour needs are. It is important that that autonomy be maintained so that the industries will be able to decide about their own affairs. Therefore the whole of our labour legislation is organized in such a way that every industry has its own apprenticeship committees and industrial councils. If these bodies are not prepared to act in matters affecting their own needs, I should like to see how the proposed manpower board in the Bill of that hon. member would have managed it. That manpower board consisted of seven members. That hon. member&#x2019;s Bill did in fact grant the power to prescribe to industries, that is to say, on the advice of the national manpower board. It is obvious that all industries cannot be represented on such a board. Therefore they will not show the necessary interest. It is obvious that the necessary co-operation will then not be forthcoming either. What success can one therefore expect from that scheme? This Bill does not make provision only for organized industry. This Bill also makes provision for unorganized industry. These constituted the objections of the hon. member for Musgrave too. I did not find it at all strange when the hon. Leader of the House expressed his surprise this afternoon that the hon. member is the secretary of the labour group. It is obvious that he never studied this Bill. It was obvious when he spoke that he did not have the foggiest notion of the contents of the Bill.</p>

<p>In clause 3 provision is made for unorganized industry. It will be possible for all the provisions of the Conciliation Act which are applicable to industrial agreements to be made applicable to such agreements as well. In this connection the hon. member must take note of subsection 3 of section 48 (a). The hon. member also maintained that this Bill does not extend far enough and is limited only to industrial councils. Industrial councils are, after all, bodies which consist of employers and employees. Surely these people know what activities are being carried on. Therefore it is up to them to provide or attempt to provide in their own needs by concluding agreements in respect of categories where training needs exist.</p>

<p>It is very obvious to me that the hon. member for Musgrave does not have the foggiest notion of this Bill. It is also very clear to me that after this proposed legislation has been implemented, that part of the private sector which has not yet contributed its share in eliminating the shortage of trained manpower, will have to contribute its rightful share in the future. They will no longer be able to live on the public and Government sectors as far as the training of our manpower is concerned. Who is the greatest trainer of manpower in this country to-day? It is the State, the public sector. Examples are Iscor and Escom. There are others as well. The private industrialist who merely wants to bid and offer a higher salary in order to entice these people away, has never contributed his rightful share. They will in fact have to do so in the future.</p>

<p>Another important provision contained in this Bill is that the employee who also has a share in the negotiation of industrial council agreements, will be able to guard over his own future. He will be a co-planner. He will have a joint say in training schemes. He will be able to watch over dangers which can possibly arise. I want to refer specifically to one danger, namely the economic integration policy of that hon. member. The only solution they have is to meet the manpower shortage by employing non-Whites. That is the last thing we can allow. We are in favour of the employment of the Black man. We need the Black man in this country, but he certainly needs us as well. We cannot afford to disturb that balance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know why the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark who spoke the other evening and today adopted an aggressive attitude and said this side of the House is against every government measure and that we are planning to undermine the whole labour position in this country. He made some wild statements and asked us whether we understood the Bill and whether we understood the Industrial Conciliation Act. After listening to him this afternoon, I gathered that he had a fair knowledge of this Bill, but I cannot say that he understands the Industrial Conciliation Act nor am I sure that he has read it and knows what the basis of the whole Act is and what industrial agreements are. The hon. member did a disservice to this House when he started to bring colour into the debate. If he understands anything about industrial agreements as far as engineering, the motor industry and other industries are concerned, he should know that they make provision for both the White and <span class="col_1649-1650" refersTo="page_0839"/>the Coloured groups. When an industrial council introduces any scheme for training it does not only look after the one section, it looks after both. There is no suggestion that any Industrial Council itself is politically inspired or a supporter of the Government. Therefore I think it is wrong of the hon. member to try and make any political capital or major point out of this issue for the coming election. I do not think the workers will be too pleased either, because they take a great interest in Industrial Council matters and they know what is going on. From my experience of workers, I know that they take a very great interest through the trade unions in their councils; they know what is going on. The position, as far as the worker is concerned, is that he is sick and tired of politics being brought into his industrial relations with the Government. When he is dealing with the Government, he does not like to think that he is dealing on a political basis. Whenever that hon. member talks on labour matters he tries to bring in the political angle. The worker does not like the political angle, because the worker to-day, and every day, has to deal with the Government in power. Therefore he does not want to be an ally of this Government, nor will he want to be an ally of the United Party when it gets into power on the 23rd April.</p>

<p>This particular Bill is an important Bill, and I do not think that the hon. member has understood it fully. We in this country are faced with the necessity of training our youth and those people who are entering industry. They must be trained so that we can meet the high technological requirements of to-day. To-day we are progressing so fast in this field that the training, in order to keep pace with the world of industry, has to be of a very high standard. When the hon. member for Hillbrow introduced his private Bill last year, that was what he had in view. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark has only one thing in mind and that is the training of apprentices.</p>

<p>I think it is a good thing to give the Government side the background of manpower training in order to get away from this political influence that has been brought in by the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark. Under the Industrial Conciliation Act the industrial councils have been formed to negotiate agreements between employer and employee who have equal representation on both sides of the table. It was never at any stage suggested that the industrial councils should take part in the training of manpower. I want to give the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark the background, because I have had a great deal to do with this scheme. There is a shortage of money for training and the only available vehicle which you can use to collect money from the employer and the employee is via the Industrial Councils. There you have members of both sides of the industry, namely the employer and the employee. That is why this particular vehicle is being used. At the present moment the motor industry runs a scheme and so does the engineering industry because it was found that it was very necessary to do something about the training of our youngsters. The hon. the Minister knows very well that there seems to be an unbridgeable gap between labour and education. Labour is on the one side and education on the other. When you have an apprenticeship committee, you have educationists who serve in an advisory capacity, but labour is a separate entity altogether. Therefore the training of the youngster is really an educational matter and not one for the Department of Labour. That is why the Industrial Council is used only to get the employer and the employee together in order to raise the finance for this purpose. That is the only vehicle by means of which they can collect the finance to assist in this training. It is done in the absence of any other body in this country as suggested by the hon. member for Hillbrow. There is no other body that can do this particular work. The employers and employees realize that these youths require extra training and extra expenditure is needed in order to provide the equipment for technical colleges etc. Money has to be found to do all this, and the only way in which it can be collected is by the Industrial Council. The Industrial Council at no time laid down any course of training. This was done in conjunction with the technical colleges and the employers and employees. When one looks at Section 25 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, one finds that one cannot have outsiders on the sub-committees for which provision is made under this Act. The committee can only consist of employer and employee, and therefore the educationists are only in an advisory capacity. They have no real say in the committee. Therefore this Bill itself can only serve a temporary purpose. The employers and the employees felt that something must be done in regard to the education of our youngsters as technicians. This had to be done because the Government did not go ahead as far as the education of our youngsters in this field was concerned.</p>

<heading>BIBLE SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the year 1970 will not only be known as the Water Year, but will indeed also be known as the Year of the Bible, or Biblia 70. The reason is that this year, 1970, it is 100 years ago that the first Bible distribution organization was established in South Africa. I think it redounds to the great credit of South Africa and the Parliament of South Africa that the Bible Society has felt itself free to approach Parliament and to ask Parliament to give it (the Bible Society), for the reasons which I shall mention here, its own Act under which it may operate. The fact that the Bible Society felt itself free to address this request to Parliament, illustrates more than anything else that South Africa is in fact a Christian country and can lay claim to being one. This is also confirmed by the fact that Parliament was not only prepared to accede to this request, but indeed, has also set aside time, and in fact made time, during this short Session to give effect to this fine request made by the Bible Society.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the name British and Foreign Bible Society has been known to most of us since childhood as the name of the organization whose primary and sole task it has been to distribute the Bible in South Africa. In passing, one may just note that on 23rd August, 1820, 150 years ago, the South African Auxiliary Bible Society was established in Cape Town under the chairmanship of the then Governor, Sir Rufane Donkin, and that the name was later changed to the British and Foreign Bible Society of South Africa, as we have known it. This remained the position until 1965, when the South African branch of that Society became independent. But notwithstanding the fact that it had become independent, it was still left hanging in mid-air, because it did not have its own Act, and it was still regarded as a foreign company in the records of the Registrar of Companies. The purpose of the legislation now before the House is to grant the Bible Society its own South African Statute as a South African company or organization, whatever one wants to call it.</p>

<p>If one looks at the history of this Bible Society, one is struck by the fact that the Bible appeared in the Tswana language as long ago as 1857. That was the first complete Bible to appear in a Bantu language in Africa. Then followed the complete Bible in Xhosa in 1859, in Southern Sotho in 1881, in Zulu in 1883, in Northern Sotho in 1904, in Afrikaans in 1933, and it is interesting to note in passing that since 1933 no fewer than 6 million Bibles have been printed in Afrikaans and distributed. Then followed the Bible in Venda in 1936, in Ndonga in 1954, in Tsonga in 1957, and in Nama in 1967. One would also like to mention the New Testament which appeared in Herero in 1879 and the New Testament in Kwanjama in 1927, as well as the Bible in Braille for those citizens of South Africa who are blind. One also notes, Mr. Speaker, that the complete Bible&#x2014;that is to say both the Old and the New Testament&#x2014;is already available in 242 languages of the world, and that 81 of these languages are of Africa; i.e. African languages constitute one-third of the languages of the world in which the Bible is published. If one looks at the New Testament or sections of the Bible, one finds that these are available in 1,392 languages of the world, 435 of which are of Africa.</p>

<p>I have told you, Mr. Speaker, that the Society became independent in 1965, but that as a result of the problem that it is still a foreign company, that unlike other Bible Societies it has had no Act of its own on which it was based, it has become necessary to pass this legislation. It is a Society which does grand work, and I refer hon. members to clause 3 of the Bill, from which it is very clear that this Society was not founded and does not have as its object to publish any religious writings other than the Bible. It confines itself solely to the distribution of the Bible and the Bible alone. It makes Bibles available at exceptionally low prices, and one is surprised, if one sees the printing and the quality of the publications, that they can in fact be made available at these prices, and one is glad that there are so many private individuals, organizations and churches that are prepared to make large contributions in order to make the Bible available as cheaply as possible. If one considers the fact that last year alone the South African Bible Society made available no fewer than 11 million Bibles and portions of the Scriptures in South Africa alone in 71 languages, one realizes what a major task it is performing, and therefore it is fitting not only that this Parliament should set its seal on the Society by granting it an Act of its own, but also that every one of us should pray for the progress of this organization in order to enable it to perform its particular task to the glory of God.</p>

<speech by="#villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House will support the second reading of this Bill. This society has without doubt done magnificent work over a very long period, and it is most significant with what enthusiasm and what success it is carrying on its work at the present time. I note with considerable interest that it is distributing to-day nearly five times as many Bibles as it was 15 years ago. In South Africa we are distributing more Bibles than in any other country in the world with the exception of the <span class="col_1653-1654" refersTo="page_0841"/>United States of America and Western Germany; we stand third in the world, and I think that is due to the manner in which this society has undertaken its work. In the Western Cape alone its income has increased to and a half times over the last five years, which gives some idea of public support. When you have a society with an overall income of something like R668,000 a year, as it was last year, an increase of over R80,000 over the year before, then it is quite clear that it needs proper legal recognition. It can be asked: Why an Act of Parliament and not registration under the Companies Act? The answer is that overseas it has, I think, been incorporated by an Order-in Council because the provisions of the Companies Act were not suitable for an organization of this kind. Here in South Africa, for similar reasons, it is not something that could be incorporated under the Companies Act because there are no shareholders and its organization is of an entirely different kind. Therefore it seeks legal personality by means of an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>I feel that this is essentially something which should have our support and have our support particularly in this 150th anniversary of its existence in South Africa. Not only has it been responsible for the Afrikaans Bible in large print&#x2014;the first Bible, I believe, to have been entirely translated, printed, published and produced here in South Africa&#x2014;but the film with which the work of the Society is publicized, Living Waters, has received an enthusiastic reception not only throughout South Africa but in other parts of the world. In addition, Sir, it has emphasized the importance of accurate translations, translations not only making the Bible available in their own languages to different peoples and different races all over the world, but also keeping the language of the Bible up to date as the languages of peoples have changes. Therefore we see tremendous attention also in the work of this Society to modern translations of the Bible. I feel that the fact, as the hon. the Prime Minister said, that we can find time to deal. with this matter in this short session is a tribute not only to the Bible Society but to the general approach of people in South Africa to religion and religious institutions and the Word of God as spread through the Bible.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>We opposed the second reading of this Bill and all the objections we raised then are still valid, and after hearing the Minister&#x2019;s motivation in the Committee Stage on the different clauses, we are more certain than ever that this measure should not appear on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>We gave two reasons for opposing this measure. The one is that it will result in a deprivation of rights acquired by the Bantu in terms of section 10 of the Urban Areas Act, and secondly, that it gives dictatorial powers to the Minister to prohibit Bantu from entering certain employment. During the second-reading debate, the hon. the Deputy Minister took it amiss that we should even suggest that he or his Minister could deprive an African of the rights given to him and his family by Dr. Verwoerd in 1952. He took it amiss that we said that by taking powers under this Bill he could in fact remove them from an urban area. However, in rejecting our amendments which sought to ensure that those rights were protected, the hon. the Deputy Minister quite blatantly admitted that Africans enjoying rights under section 10 would be in no better position than any other African who happened to fall under the category of those who had to be removed from a particular area. If the section 10 Bantu lives in a location, a Bantu village or Bantu hostel which is to be removed at the wish of a local authority and with the approval of the Minister, or against the wish of the local authority on instructions from the Minister, that African could be removed at the request of the local authority or the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development and be given alternative accommodation wherever the Secretary deems fit. His section 10 rights mean absolutely nothing to him, and the Minister cannot deny that, nor does he in fact deny it. This removal need not be related or connected with health reasons, slum clearance or public safety, nor with the availability of suitable alternative accommodation within the area, or even the question of suitable employment in the area. It has nothing to do with the reasons for which the Minister can remove the hostel, the village or the location.</p>

<p>Clause 7 amends the existing law which obliges a local authority to offer an occupant of a dwelling condemned by its health Officer alternative accommodation in its area. It now gives the Minister the right to intervene and he can refuse to allow the removal to a place within the urban area and insist that the African, whether he has acquired rights under section 10 or not, be removed to an area outside the jurisdiction of the local authority. Now these measures are blatant denials of the rights earned over a long period and a betrayal of Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy to give the urban African some security in a life beset by so many Jaws and regulations that he can never know from day to day what his fate is to be. I say that Dr. Verwoerd in 1952 gave these rights purposely because of the various regulations which were being introduced in fact to interfere with the rights of the urban African.</p>

<p><span class="col_1655-1656" refersTo="page_0842"/>Then there is the job reservation clause in this Bill. Of course the Minister denies that it is job reservation, but in fact it has no different effect from job reservation. We say that this is even harsher than the ordinary job reservation because it can be applied at the whim of the Minister without any enquiry or consultation with the parties concerned, namely the employers or the employees. We all know that in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act the Tribunal has first to hold a public enquiry and consult with interested parties before it can in fact recommend that certain races be deprived of doing work done by the Whites. Now this Minister takes power in the widest possible terms to prohibit the employment of Africans in a specified area, in a specified class of employment, in a specified trade or in the service of a specified employer or class of employer. One area can be preferred to another and, worse still, one employer to another employer, and the Minister gave two reasons for this at different times. The one was that it was necessary to prevent work passing from white hands into black hands. That was the reason he gave during the second-reading debate. But I notice that he did not use that reason in the discussions in the Committee Stage. In the Committee Stage he emphasized that the reason was to avoid offence being given by one race to another. In regard to the reason that it was to prevent work passing from white hands to black hands, we pointed out that there were in fact sufficient measures to-day for the Government to control that, and this measure now introduced by this Minister is in fact a vote of no confidence in the Minister of Labour. The Minister of Labour is empowered, and in fact it is incumbent upon him, to do just what the Deputy Minister wants to do in this Bill. If the Minister of Labour has refused to intervene and he in fact recognizes the fact that there is a shortage of manpower and that it is undesirable to restrict labour in this way, why does the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development not at least take the same precautions that the Minister of Labour takes before applying this Act? Why does not he do what the Minister of Labour is bound to do, namely to have an enquiry where the parties interested can appear and state their case? If the Minister of Labour in fact is not prepared to intervene&#x2014;and we must accept that that is so, because otherwise this Bill would not be necessary&#x2014;then we can take it that if the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development prohibits the use of Bantu labour, Coloured or Indian labour can be used in the place of black labour, and the work in fact will not be kept in the hands of the white worker. The first object of the Minister, namely to protect the white workers, will not be achieved, and neither will his second object, namely to avoid offence being given to Whites who object to being served by Bantu or to work alongside Bantu, be achieved. So we must assume that apartheid is not white as distinguished from non-white, but only white as different from Bantu. If it is offensive for Whites to be served by Bantu, surely it must be more offensive for them to serve the Bantu. It all boils down to this; If the provisions of this Bill are applied, we will eventually have to have separate shops for Blacks and Whites.</p>

<p>Now one of the categories mentioned by the Minister of employees to be affected is the typist. Does the Minister realize that there is such a shortage of typists to-day that they can in fact state their own terms; and does he realize that there are more Coloured typists being employed than Bantu typists? The Coloured typists are certainly being employed on a large scale, but I do not think Bantu typists are employed on the same scale as Coloured typists. The Minister went on further and said that the main purpose of this Bill&#x2014;every time he speaks we get another purpose&#x2014;is to avoid Bantu and Whites working alongside each other. He said: &#x201C;Dit sal ook sekerheid by werkgewers bring omdat hulle nou sal weet dat hulle nie langer Bantoes in bepaalde werkkategorie&#x00EB; sal kan plaas nie.&#x201D; That means that there will be certainty for the employers because they will know that they can no longer use Bantu in certain specified categories of work, but how will the employer know it? He will only know it when he sees a notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, giving a month&#x2019;s notice. He will not be given an opportunity to appear before a Board or the Minister to state his case or to raise objection. All he will get is one month&#x2019;s notice that he can no longer employ Bantu. How does that help him if he has already built up his business on the employment of Bantu labour, especially in certain areas? The Minister shakes his head, but that is in fact so. There is no restriction on the Minister. The only thing the Minister has to do now, in terms of the amendment which he himself proposed in the Committee Stage, is to give notice in the <i>Gazette</i> that he intends doing it and that he will consult with the Minister of Labour. But I submit there is no protection for the employer. Now I want to know this from the Minister. Is there to be a general prohibition against Blacks working alongside Whites? If not. why is it objectionable only in certain instances? Either there is a principle that they do not want Whites working alongside Blacks and they do not want Blacks serving Whites at all, or there is no such principle. If that is not so, I say there is no consistency in their policy, if they are going to grant exemptions and allow certain categories of work to be done by Blacks where they can serve Whites or alongside Whites. Are the Ministers of Coloured Affairs and Indian Affairs going to follow the lead and the line taken by this Minister, or are they less willing to apply apartheid than the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development? I say again that if it is undesirable for Bantu to serve Whites or to work alongside Whites, surely then it must also be undesirable for Coloureds and Indians to serve Whites or to work alongside them. If we take this sort of argument to its logical conclusions, what are we going to <span class="col_1657-1658" refersTo="page_0843"/>have in this country? We will have only Whites working alongside Whites, Indians working alongside Indians and only Bantu working alongside Bantu. What will happen to the country? The country will come to a standstill. It is a ridiculous proposition. The hon. the Deputy Minister can say that he is going to give exemptions. This is exactly where the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy is falling down. It only works on exemptions and if there are to be exemptions, the principle is not being applied. I say again, if it is wrong for a white man to be served by a black man or wrong for a white woman to work alongside a black typist then the principle of working together must surely be wrong throughout. It cannot just be applicable in certain cases.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, towards the end the hon. member for Transkei obtained the assistance of the entire Opposition in an endeavour to complete his speech. It is clear that the hon. member, as well as other members of the Opposition, have never understood this Bill. The hon. member&#x2019;s speech is, then, also the clearest proof that all of them have failed to see the objects of this legislation. This morning the hon. member once more adopted the old Opposition custom of saying that this legislation would grant the hon. the Minister dictatorial powers. We have known the Opposition for years. If they dislike something that does not exactly suit their purpose, they claim that the Minister wants to usurp dictatorial or extraordinary powers for himself. This is an expression we hear whenever they oppose certain legislation. The hon. member referred to the Bill as a measure that merely wanted to bring about apartheid between Whites and Blacks, and he asked what the position of Coloureds and Indians would be. Hon. members opposite apparently do not yet know that this hon. Deputy Minister deals with Bantu, affairs. Hon. members must therefore simply curb their curiosity a little and wait to see what the position in connection with the other races will be. Then the hon. member also said that it was as a result of verkrampte pressure, exercised upon the Government, that this measure was now being implemented. Sir, surely that hon. member is fast asleep if that is what he is claiming, because he ought to know that this measure was introduced last year and that certain developments had then not taken place yet.</p>

<p>Throughout the Second Reading and the Committee Stage the Opposition raised the parrot-cry, i.e. that the Bantu would be deprived of his work as a result of this legislation, and that, in terms of section 10 of the Urban Areas Act of 1945. there would be no protection for him. The hon. member said so again this morning. This was the argument throughout. Despite the repetitions and the assurances of the Deputy Minister, the Opposition still hammers away at this same point. If this Opposition were open to any ideas they would have reconciled themselves and have accepted this positive measure.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the Opposition was also going to oppose this measure during the Third Reading. We accept that in many cases, and here as well, the Opposition is prompted by various bodies about when they should oppose a measure and when they should not. Thus they were, for example, prompted by the English language Press which was conjuring up spectres last year, and drawing far-fetched conclusions in connection with this legislation. Apart from the English language Press I shall also refer to certain other bodies. I am referring here to the South African Institute of Race Relations and the South African Council of Churches. Recently, from the Religious Societies of Friends, a circular reached us which also prescribed to the Opposition in connection with this measure, or at least promised them support. I shall come back to this in a moment and quote a few relevant pieces.</p>

<p>Clause 11 of this Bill is the clause about which the hon. member had a great deal to say in respect of work categories. This legislation <span class="col_1661-1662" refersTo="page_0845"/>proposes to prohibit white employers from employing Bantu in certain work spheres or categories existing in white sectors. Now the hon. member generalizes his arguments against this measure. There are, indeed, certain work categories affected by this legislation. This Bill also makes provision for the service contracts of Bantu already employed in such categories to be cancelled or annulled, and for sufficient time to be given to replace the Bantu. The employment of Bantu in the white work spheres or categories, conventionally and traditionally set apart for Whites, has been going on right before our eyes in recent years. There are, for example, the occupations referred to time and again in these debates. There are occupations such as those of shop clerk, counter clerk, typist, switchboard operator and even administrative clerk that are held by Bantu in white sectors. In my constituency a number of years ago there was even a case of a Bantu acting as an agent for a certain white person selling houses in a specific area. At the end of each month that Bantu went and collected the rent from Whites. This happened only a few years ago. As a result of this legislation such a thing cannot take place again. Fortunately that matter was investigated and an end made to the anomaly. As I have said, this situation, where Bantu are employed in white work spheres, developed right before our eyes, and has already begun to take on serious proportions. It is creating dissatisfaction and friction. The Government is now compelled to take these steps, as embodied in this Bill, to restrict these abuses that are occurring, before serious clashes and friction develop, which could seriously damage or endanger the existing labour peace which we are so happy about. Each of us is aware of the fact that the cheap labour of the Bantu lays the foundation for the greater employment of non-Whites, particularly Bantu, in jobs traditionally and conventionally held by Whites. In the circular of the South African Council of Churches an allegation was made which I should like to quote. I know that hon. members, and particularly the hon. member for Houghton will, of course, agree wholeheartedly with it. The following statement was made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu Laws Amendment Bill provides for unchecked and limitless power over the work opportunities of African people in South Africa &#x2026; It is moreover unjust and violates the conscience of Christians that persons who are as much natives of South Africa as White South Africans should be subjected to discrimination in employment opportunities on the grounds of race alone.</block>

<p>Sir, what a perverse view of the situation this is! Since when has the work of counter clerks, etc., in white work spheres, been an &#x201C;employment opportunity&#x201D; or a &#x201C;work opportunity&#x201D; for any non-Whites, particularly for a Bantu? These occupations in white work spheres, where Whites serve and are served, have always traditionally been occupations for Whites. It has always been a part of the &#x201C;South African way of life&#x201D;. These are words the Opposition is also fond of using, embodying an idea supposedly regarded with deference by the Opposition. Must what this legislation now wants to implement suddenly be regarded as a small apartheid? One can expect such pleas from the South African Council of Churches. This is, among others, a body which would want to remove every trace of apartheid from our Statute Book, if given the opportunity. In fact, this is also the standpoint of some members of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The argument that is raised, about there being insufficient white employees available to fill vacancies, does not sound convincing at all. If there is, in fact, a shortage of white employees in the categories I have just mentioned, it is an artificial or a fabricated shortage. Certain white employers must be blamed, to a large extent, for such a situation, because the wages they attach to those various posts are too low. The wage structure is still inadequate, and it is impossible for the white employee to work for those low wages. In these categories Bantu workers are very necessary in the homelands, where they can do this kind of work for their own people. One would expect serious objections and severe opposition to this legislation in certain business and industrial circles, particularly in respect of clause 11. These employers are only disposed towards obtaining cheap labour and making greater profits. These employers, who do not freely want to co-operate now in maintaining our traditional labour pattern, must not subsequently complain because this legislation is now being introduced and will be strictly implemented at a later stage. The United Party and the Progressive Party want to throw open all work spheres. They advocate &#x201C;labour on the best market&#x201D;. They are integration parties, because they want to create more employment opportunities for the Bantu in the white areas. They want to create a greater incentive in order to promote the policy of integration. After all, they are actually integration parties. The U.P. thinks it will solve the race problem by creating a single South Africa with a single integrated community. This Bill, particularly clause 11, specifically wants to prevent this. In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Deputy Minister rightly said that this was a precautionary measure against Black-White integration. The traditional work categories for Whites are also delimited by this Bill. This legislation is a logical consequence of the National Party&#x2019;s policy of separate development.</p>

<p>The various clauses of the Bill were discussed, particularly clause 8, according to which, with the approval of the Minister, the profits on Bantu beer could be applied in any sphere in the Bantu homelands for development there. I should like to state that this is a very welcome measure, because in this way it creates the opportunity for still greater ties between the Bantu of the urban and metropolitan white areas and his homeland, since he <span class="col_1663-1664" refersTo="page_0846"/>contributes to certain aspects of development there. We should see this homeland development as the task, not only of the Minister, one department and one city council, but of a nation. It is a national task. However, in the process the Bantu must be helped. Hon. members will say that the Bantu beer profits that can be ploughed into the homelands in that way are only drops in the ocean. Let us acknowledge that they are drops in the ocean, but at least they are large drops, particularly because the Bantu can also contribute in this indirect way. I believe that in time this money could also perhaps be applied to educational matters in the Bantu homelands. I am thinking of one aspect, that of Bantu hostels. There are many Bantu in the urban areas who would like to send their children to the Bantu homelands to be educated, because those Bantu would like to retain ethnic ties with the homelands. In this respect I believe that this legislation is going to serve a very good purpose.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the Government is directing its attention to economic development in the homelands, but at the same time it is also directing its attention to the spiritual, cultural and intellectual development and the upliftment of those Bantu, because this is as necessary as economic development. I see that in this legislation the opportunity is also being created for the realization of that part of the Bantu&#x2019;s development in the homelands. It is not so much a question of the place where the Bantu is born or where he lives, as it is a question of his origins. Even though a Bantu lives in an urban Bantu area, this Bill specifically affords him even more opportunities for ties with his homeland, or for becoming spiritually and politically rooted in his homeland.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it would not surprise the hon. members for Koedoespoort to hear that I disagree with practically everything that he has said. In the first place I want to tell the hon. member that he does not know what he is talking about when he talks about these traditional patterns of labour in South Africa as if they were a continuing and unchanging process. If he would only cast his mind back over the South Africa of the past 20 years, he might see that there have been enormous changes in the so-called traditional patterns of labour in South Africa. Jobs which 20 years ago were never done by Africans or other non-Whites, for instance, are now being done by them in every possible field. In every field of semi-skilled work in industry there are non-Whites working at machines. They have come into the machine-operative jobs because there are no Whites to do those jobs and because the Whites have graduated to the skilled jobs at higher wage rates. So he is absolutely wrong about that. 20 years ago there were no Africans driving heavy lorries but to-day that is a job performed almost entirely by Africans and other non-Whites. 20 years ago there was no such thing as a non-White postman but to-day there appears to be no stigma attached to receiving one&#x2019;s letters or telegrams from a non-white hand. Housewives do not faint dead away when a non-White postman comes to the door. The hon. member talked about the tragic circumstance of a non-white agent collecting rents from Whites as if something really horrifying had happened. I tell him that in 10 years&#x2019; time that will probably be the normal practice in South Africa, otherwise there will be nobody to collect rents. In Johannesburg there is at present a major row about the bus drivers. It took some considerable time before the Johannesburg municipality plucked up sufficient courage to employ African drivers on the African buses. There were no white people to drive those buses and eventually after great goings-on between the Government and the Transport Workers&#x2019; Union and the City Council which had a real cadenza over the political implications of this, African bus drivers were employed to drive the black buses.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It has everything to do with this Bill and I will tell the hon. the Deputy Minister why in a moment. We now have the same situation in regard to white buses. There are not enough white bus drivers and in Johannesburg one bus service after the other is being cancelled to the intense indignation and annoyance of white passengers who cannot get to work on time, who cannot get home from work and who find themselves being gravely inconvenienced. The solution that has been suggested is that Coloured bus drivers be employed to drive the white buses. There is a tremendous fight going on about this because, according to the hon. member for Koedoespoort, it is tradition that white bus drivers should drive buses carrying white passengers. What are we going to do when there are not any white bus drivers coming forward to provide the essential service of transport, not only for the lucky people of the northern suburbs of Johannesburg, but also for the southern, eastern and western suburbs where thousands upon thousands of Nationalist supporters live. Funnily enough, they need to get to work just as the other people do. Mr. Speaker, do you know what is going to happen eventually? They are going to accept the untraditional pattern of being driven into town by Coloured and eventually black bus drivers. Are the heavens going to fall? Is white civilization going to crash in South Africa? I suggest that it is not going to crash because these changes are taking place all the time. There is no such thing as a static economy. The economy is dynamic. Fortunately for all of us, it is dynamic. It is not at the cost of efficient Whites that these changes are taking place. The efficient white man always does find a job and it is usually at a better wage rate. The hon. member for Koedoespoort said that the reason why these changes were taking place in these traditional <span class="col_1665-1666" refersTo="page_0847"/>categories was that the wages were too low and that greedy businessmen were trying to make greater profits. There is an easy solution to this. Let us have wages fixed at proper rates, in other words at the rate that the job should carry. It should have nothing to do with colour and not depend upon whether the job is done by a white man, a black man or a Coloured man, but merely upon what the job is worth. Having fixed wages at that rate, our economy will function like that of any normal country.</p>

<p>Of course we will hever agree on that. Mr. Speaker, that hon. member knows nothing about economics. I am not sure what he does know something about but he knows nothing about economics.

They are even stronger than Nationalist bigotry, believe it or not, which is just as well for this country or it would not have advanced the way it has advanced over the past 20 or 30 years.</p>

<p>Let me say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he has not given us one solitary good reason for putting this measure on the Statute Book. He has given us a great number of bad reasons and all of them have to do with narrow-minded viewpoints. He and his party are being driven by the impetus of what has happened to their own party with the Herstigte Party. It is no good saying it is nonsense, because it is not. It is perfectly true that this Bill was introduced last year before the advent of these new developments, but hon. members will admit that this split in the party did not take place overnight. There were already considerable mumblings and bumblings between verkramptes and the super-verkramptes the whole of the last session. There are no verligte Nationalists, as I said a year or two ago, and I have certainly not changed my mind since then. There is no such animal as a verligte Nationalist.</p>

<p>I am trying to give the hon. the Deputy Minister the reasons for the introduction of this Bill. He has given us no good reasons. The reason is that the Government is so perturbed about what is happening in its own ranks, that it has to put up this fa&#x00E7;ade of extreme reactionaryism. The Nationalist congresses of last year were permeated by the influence of the super-verkramptes and led to the resolutions about white shop girls in Brakpan having to work behind counters with Coloured or African shop girls and the terrible consternation of the hon. member for Benoni. He still has not indicated to me why these white girls did not leave to find employment, probably at better wages, just around the corner.</p>

<p>I am not denying that he has the power to do this. But I want to point out to the hon. member that those two white girls were there of their own volition and that they could have left any time they did not like it. The answer is that they did not leave because they did not care. They do not share the hon. member for Benoni&#x2019;s bigoted views. That is the real truth of the matter. They have probably found that the African clerk with whom they are working is a very polite person. It therefore does not worry them in the slightest. They most probably find this person very efficient.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned before, the hon. the Deputy Minister is putting a measure on the Statute Book to the detriment of the people whose interests he should be looking after. African advancement is what has caused this Bill. African advancement in certain fields of work has been the major cause of this Bill. Instead of the hon. the Deputy Minister being glad that the people under his care have by efficiency and conscientious work managed to advance into categories where they will be earning a better living, all he does is to come along and put a damper on their hopes of advancement. I say it is a shame that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration should be responsible for a Bill of this kind. He should take pride in the fact that the people under his care are advancing. He has no business to stop their advancement by a legislative barrier which has absolutely no connection whatsoever with efficiency or anything else. He and not a single other member has been able to provide a single example of racial friction as a result of these very few cases so far of the incursion of Africans into these fields of labour. I challenge hon. members to produce one single example. The feeble reply will be that they want to prevent racial friction. What nonsense! There is no sign of racial friction in any of the jobs taken over by Africans.</p>

<p>I suppose that housewives objected to handing over their rents to African agents. They probably object to handing it over to white agents as well. Nobody likes to pay rent. It is as simple as that.</p>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that white people in this country have every advantage. They receive assistance from the Government in every single field. They receive generous maintenance allowances which Africans do not get. They undergo free and compulsory education which Africans certainly do not get. They also get very generous vocational training opportunities. I am all for that, but I do not like it being limited on a racial basis. White people get all the assistance possible. They also have the assistance of the vast customary colour bar, which the United Party is pledged to maintain. They are pledged to maintain the great barrier to the advancement of non-Whites to semi-skilled and skilled jobs. How they correlate that with their policy of complete utilization of all our resources, while saying they are going to maintain the customary colour bar, is beyond me. I leave it to them to explain on their party platforms if they can. Of course, they will not bother to explain that on their country platforms, because all one will hear on the platteland is the maintenance of the customary colour bar. It is only when they talk in the Parktowns, Houghtons and Sea Points that they talk of the full utilization of labour. I want to leave the United Party to one side. Let them try and reconcile their consciences with this utterly irreconcilable policy of the maintenance of the customary colour bar, which is <i>the</i> greatest stumbling block to the best use of manpower and not job reservation, and the full utilization of labour. Job reservation applies to only 2 per cent of the whole labour force. I say again that white people have all the advantages, namely free and compulsory education, good vocational training as well as the customary colour bar. No efficient white person needs the protection of legislative barriers to African advancement. If there are so many hundreds of thousands of inefficient white people I will be very surprised, because I doubt whether South Africa could have advanced to the degree of development which she has if she had this burden of inefficient white people who are unable to stand on their own two feet in competition with non-white people who start at such an enormous disadvantage from the beginning. I think therefore that it is flagrant nonsense to suggest that white people require further protection. As I have said, not one single good example was advanced by any member in this connection.</p>

<p>That hon. member lives in, shall I say, this isolated island, which is absolutely divorced from real life outside. He should step out of this Chamber and walk down Adderley Street and he will see what there is of the white way of life in South Africa. It does not exist. The integrated way of life in South Africa can be seen in every street, in every shop, every Office, every factory, every mine and on every farm. We have a multi-racial way of life in South Africa. I want to tell the hon. member that if by some chance every African took the advice offered to them by hon. members there and went streaming back to the homelands out of every Office, every home, every factory, every gold mine and every farm, this Government would call out the Army to stop them. That is what they would do. They would do it, because they know that South Africa would be paralysed to-morrow. There is no such thing as a white way of life in South Africa. We are all here working and living together, whether we like it or not. Hon. members are going to have to change their attitudes. It really should not be so painful. If they look back on what has happened in this country over the last 20 years, they will see that many things have changed which they or their fathers would not have dreamed about 20 years ago. In 20 years time their own children will have accepted things which they to-day cannot dream will happen in this country. Inevitably the ineluctable pressures of economic forces are going to make hon. members opposite change their minds. I leave them with the thought that they need not worry because it is not going to be too painful. In the end they may even find it very profitable to themselves. I want to end tip with one final word, to point out once more to the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is <span class="col_1669-1670" refersTo="page_0849"/>one thing to pass laws in this Parliament, and another thing to implement them.</p>

<p>Oh, no. I say that he will try and implement it. I have never had any doubt that they are going to try to implement it. They may not be able to do it, but in every case where they do implement it, they are going to cause a great deal of resentment from the Africans concerned. Because they are doing a good job, the Deputy Minister is kicking them out of that job. That is what it amounts to. Why does he think these people do not react as normal human beings? I wonder how hon. members would react if they were kicked out of their jobs while they were doing a good job? Of course, there is no danger of that. They are, however, going to be kicked out of their jobs quite soon for another reason. I tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that this call-in card system is going to cause anguish to Africans who do not understand this system. They are going to find themselves tied up in the homelands with headmen and other tribal people who do not understand how to operate the system. They are going to lose their jobs because of the inability of these people to control this vast system. I tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that this sending people back to rehabilitation centres which do not exist yet and leaving it to the homelands to decide what sort of job these people have to do when they are in detention, is without doubt the most impractical thing I have ever heard of. He has no idea of the amount of policing or anything else that any kind of system like this requires.</p>

This is why I did not blame the Police when the terrible tragedy of the van deaths was being discussed. I blame the system for it. Now the hon. member for Pinelands says the United Party is going to maintain influx control. What is he going to do with all the thousands of workless Africans in the reserves? Does he think simply by the United Party saying: &#x201C;We shall maintain influx control,&#x201D; it is going to be any easier for his party, if it comes into power, than it has proved to be for the Nationalist Government?

<p>I can show the hon. member the pamphlets. It certainly did not include white leadership without justice. There was always talk about &#x201C;with justice&#x201D; when I was a member of the United Party. That is one of the changes that has come about in the policy of the United Party since I left them. I cannot go into all the changes which have come about since I left. There was such a thing as a common roll for the Coloured people. The United Party is now a very different party from the one which I joined. But I am telling the hon. the Deputy Minister this will not be workable. The actual policing is not possible because of the tremendous pressure of poverty in the reserves. It is true that a number of people come into the towns because they like the bright lights and the gay city life. There is no doubt about that. But the vast majority of people come into the towns for one reason and one reason only. That is for the employment opportunities that the industrial areas of South Africa offer. That will continue no matter what the United Party does about influx control. They will have the same difficulties. Those same workless people will be sent back to the reserves. The same limited number of people will be allowed to keep their families with them. This whole thing is just unworkable. It is not handled in the light of the basic economic problem that we have to face. The only way in which we can really do this is by facing up to the fact that South Africa is basically an industrial country. We have to industrialize and that means urbanization. It also means we will have to make provision for housing for people on a stabilized family basis. It means that we will have to remove the restrictions on employment opportunities. It means that we will have to improve conditions in the rural areas as far as is possible. However, I do not for a moment believe that the reserves can ever absorb even their natural increase in population. The paper that was delivered by Dr. Riekert recently proves that beyond doubt. The reserves will never be able to cope even with their natural increase in population.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, he did not. He only takes cognizance of about 46 per cent of the African population. The rest he certainly does not provide for in the reserves. He does not even tell us what will happen to the natural increase in the towns. Certainly he does not envisage their going back to the reserves and being supported there. So this is the difficulty that we have to face, if it is a difficulty. If it is treated as an economic and not a racial problem the whole matter of course is different. Then one can see what can be done about improving circumstances on the white farms, where farmers should be made to pay far better cash wages so as to make conditions attractive on the farms for their workers. They should not be allowed to pay these low cash wages that they pay because they have this vast tied-up reservoir of labour that they can rely on. We can improve conditions as best as we can in the so-called rural areas of the reserves. For the rest it is an industrializing society. As I have said before, there is no reason that South Africa, like any other industrializing society, should not be able to cope with the movement of people from the rural areas to the urban areas. I can tell the hon. the Minister that this law will cause racial friction. It will not prevent racial friction. It is basically an unfair law. It will therefore be a cause of racial friction. He is not able just to push people back like chattels as he thinks he can do under other sections in this Act. He is not taking the necessary measures to accommodate and provide employment for those people. Therefore I say that this law, like so many other laws passed by the Government over the last 20 years which are designed to prevent economic integration, is destined to failure.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I devote a little attention to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, I want to say, as a representative of an area where large problems exist in respect of this matter, problems that will be corrected by this legislation, that it is really a pleasure for me to be able to say to this House that if there is one member who is really pleased that such progress has been made with this legislation it is the member for Harrismith. We have a problem there, and the hon. member who spoke here against the legislation, as well as the hon. Opposition, does not have the vaguest idea of the problems that can develop if a Minister, or a Government, does not have certain powers at his disposal which enable him to take certain steps. When hon. members now plead here for the retention of the old system, are they not aware of the fact that they are in reality pleading for a certain situation to flourish, a situation which is not beneficial to, and to the advantage of, the Bantu, or the Whites in that area.</p>

<p>Before I come back to the legislation, I want to correct a few references of the hon. member for Houghton. At the end of her speech she said: &#x201C;Farmers must be made to pay far better wages.&#x201D; I want to tell the hon. member that she displayed a great deal of ignorance in her speech, but this statement of hers can definitely be refuted because, if other factors are taken into consideration the wages are not so meagre at all. If one takes the cash wage into consideration, plus the privileges such as free grazing, food, clothing, free dwellings, free firewood and free water which sometimes cost the farmer quite a bit of capital, then I must say that the hon. member is really living in a state of the greatest ignorance.</p>

<p>I can understand this very well, and hon. members must allow me to give my own view, i.e. that that hon. member and her kindred <span class="col_1673-1674" refersTo="page_0851"/>spirits cannot actually infuse themselves into our &#x201C;way of life&#x201D;, to which she referred a moment ago. They cannot even assimilate with our Whites; how can they understand what the actual relationship must be among ourselves, who want apartheid, but who are also aware of our relationship with the non-Whites? I can understand why the hon. member thinks so, because she is extremely ignorant of the facts. I want to refer to a few of the aspects she mentioned here. She said that this legislation was the result of the pressure put on the National Party as a result of the establishment of the Herstigte Nasionale Party. This is, of course, absolute nonsense, because this legislation was already being prepared when they were still voting for motions of confidence in the National Party. This legislation can therefore not possibly be the result of those circumstances.</p>

<p>Those hon. members were here in the House when we were conducting the second-reading debate about this legislation. No one had anything to say against the legislation at that stage, either here or outside. From this the hon. member can see that this legislation is not before the House as a result of pressure on the Government. I should like to repeat this sentence in English, as follows: &#x201C;There was no pressure.&#x201D; Since I may not change over from one language to another I shall continue in the language in which I began my speech.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke of racial friction. But if conditions flourish as they do in certain of our residential areas, including Harrismith, this offers a good reason for the development of racial friction. This legislation provides for the empowering of the hon. the Minister to act in the case of a deproclaimed area, so that the inhabitants of the area can be removed to places which would be best for them. If this cannot happen racial friction will develop. There are numerous instances of employers refusing to employ people living in a deproclaimed area. We are aware of the fact that lawyers who are of the same mind as that hon. member have incited the Bantu in such areas, and that they want to handle the cases of the Bantu against the State, so that the Bantu could inhabit certain areas unlawfully, which cannot be to their advantage. That hon. member is under the impression that her pleas are to the advantage of the Bantu, but in this case, in opposing this legislation she is specifically arguing against the interests of those Bantu. She is arguing against their interests, because Bantu who are resettled in better residential areas where schools, churches, sports fields and other facilities are provided, are better off than those living in die unhealthy areas that have been condemned by health inspectors. The hon. member may indeed note that such residential areas are condemned by a health inspector and not by a Minister of the Government. The hon. member would do well to investigate the history of certain places and then she would not waste the time of this House.</p>

<p>I welcome this legislation and I am glad that, after our representations, the hon. the Minister prepared this legislation for us over quite a period of time, and that we can now discuss it in its final stage. The hon. member for Transkei also made a few statements. He referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to the fact that Bantu could be removed from a certain area without the necessity of consultations with the employee or employer.</p>

<p>The hon. member need not get so anxious now. It could in fact happen. When it is in the interests of the group living in that specific place or of those specific employees, the removal could take place, but it is also possible that the employer could be given the opportunity, by way of a permit, of employing those individuals for a further period. The hon. member&#x2019;s allegation, to the effect that the employee could then not be employed again by his employer, merely because he is being removed from that area, is untrue. It is not so; that hon. member tried to give the House a wrong impression, but I think there are other members here who know as much about this as the hon. member thinks he does.</p>

<p>Very well, I shall take the hon. member&#x2019;s word for that. But the fact remains that it is not detrimental to or humiliating for the Bantu to work for a white person. This has been our labour pattern throughout the country for many years. Our policy is one of apartheid, and I want to put this question to the Opposition: Is it not better for a good bus driver to drive a bus transporting members of his own race, and then preferably in his own homeland? As long as he sells his labour here in a white area he may surely do so; it is already being done. Is it not better for those people to transport members of their own race so that no racial friction can develop? Hon. members of the United Party are definitely against any form of apartheid. They are definitely in favour of integration in every field and sphere. This legislation is an instrument in the hands of the hon. the Minister for the making of sound and beneficial arrangements for all our race groups in this country.</p>

<p>Through the years it has been proved time and again by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, and by the National Government, that when removals of Bantu take place, as is now being made possible in terms of this Bill, proper housing accommodation is first made available for them. In the second place, it has been proved time and again that Bantu are not dismissed from service and taken to areas where insufficient employment opportunities exist for them. Through the years we have time and again stated this as our policy and it has been proved repeatedly when removals of Bantu took place. We had the privilege last year of visiting the areas to which Bantu were removed and to inspect the facilities there. It was wonderful to see the facilities provided for them there. Those of us who could speak their language chatted to them. If hon. members on that side of the House could speak to the Bantu in their own language they would find out how happy they are. Here, in their ignorance of the Bantu and their circumstances, those hon. members, who opposed us in every sphere and in respect of every Bill piloted through this House, showed the Bantu a great disservice and thereby created a situation here which could give rise to greater racial friction, and when racial friction develops the United Party&#x2019;s policy of race federation will simply not be practicable.</p>

<p>Sir, in conclusion I should like to say that the farmers of South Africa welcome this Bill. During the recess I had the privilege of visiting numerous farmers&#x2019; associations.

<p>I can tell you, Sir, that the farmers in the rural areas welcome this Bill because they are concerned about one thing, i.e. that for years now we have had a surplus of Bantu labour in certain areas of our country. Do you know, Sir, under what contracts Bantu were employed. They were employed under four and six month contracts, and after this period has lapsed they have to go and work outside. This Bill makes it possible for the committees and boards to ensure that the farmers have sufficient labour without having to be saddled with a surplus of Bantu labour on their farms. Sir, we can only realize our ideal if we can furnish every employer with sufficient labour, without having layabouts everywhere in the rural and urban residential areas. This is the only way to ensure proper labour arrangements.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Harrismith commenced his speech by saying that there were a large number of problems which were being solved by this measure and that he would proceed to explain them, but he failed entirely to substantiate that initial claim. Indeed, this particular Bill has singularly little application to farm labour.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say that in my opinion the recent period, as indeed previous periods, has been an extremely bad time for the Government&#x2019;s race relations policy in general and its Native policy in particular. In the course of this single year we have seen several new nails in the coffin of the Government&#x2019;s race relations policy. We have had the fact revealed that the estimate of numbers upon which the late Dr. Verwoerd worked, was out by something between 16 million and 24 million. He thought that there would be 19 million Natives at the end of the century; it now appears that there will be between 35 million and 40 million. We have seen a further failure on the part of an African state to manage its own affairs. We know that there has not been a <span class="col_1677-1678" refersTo="page_0853"/>single change of Government in an African state since the beginning of time which has occurred peacefully and constitutionally, and we have seen this process repeated again this year.</p>

<p>But, Sir, this Bill itself provides the clearest proof that in its own field Government policy is failing again. And when I say &#x201C;in its own field&#x201D; I speak of the field which is covered by the provisions of this Bill, as I shall attempt to substantiate. It is quite clear that this Bill contains extremely drastic measures to try to bolster up several aspects of their policy which are failing. Their initial policy was to draw the native peoples out of the urban areas by means of job opportunities in the reserves. This was the original &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; policy, which was part of the policy of &#x201C;groot apartheid&#x201D;. That, of course, has completely failed. What did we find? People were being endorsed out but that did not prove sufficient to halt the flow of Bantu into the urban areas. And now we have a measure which goes to the length of saying that Bantu, after being taken out of the urban areas, must be detained where they are and compelled to work there. This indicates the growing extent to which the Government is forced to resort to more and more extreme measures. But what is so interesting, Sir, is that for the success of this new measure the Government needs the co-operation of the Bantu authorities. I say that they need the co-operation of the Bantu authorities because the hon. the Deputy Minister said that it was these authorities who would supervise and control the places or institutions where the natives are to be kept and put to work after they have been endorsed out of the urban areas. He has made it quite clear that it is the Bantu authorities that are going to be asked to perform this task. Sir, what a doomed policy this is! We know that there is not a single Bantu authority that has as yet consented to attempt to carry out this policy. The Deputy Minister was unable to cite one Bantu authority that is prepared to accept this policy. Indeed, we know from the clear utterances of leaders in those authorities, certainly in the Transkei, that they are completely opposed to the policy of endorsing out their people. They are certainly not prepared to lend themselves to the policy of detaining their people in their own over-crowded reserves. [Interjections.] Sir, the hon. Whip over there fidgets uncomfortably, but this is a well-known fact. The Bantu authorities are completely opposed to the policy that they should accept in their own reserves people endorsed out of the urban areas. What they demand is that employment opportunities should be created there, and only then will they be prepared to consider the question of accepting back in the reserves people endorsed out of the urban areas. Sir, we have the incredible position that the Government solemnly comes to this Parliament to place on the Statute Book a provision which is absolute anathema to the very authorities who are being asked to ensure that this policy works. If you want a sure prescription for failure of this particular policy, then you have it in this case.</p>

<p>Sir, take the second aspect, clause 11, which allows the arbitrary denial of native labour to employers.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to say that the very fact that the Government comes with clause 11 provides the clearest possible evidence once again of the failure of Government policy. The hon. the Deputy Minister, in one of his speeches during the Committee Stage, indicated that this was designed to close cracks which were developing in the labour pattern. I think his words were that there were cracks developing in the labour pattern of the Nationalist Party. Of course there are. It is perfectly true that in the old days these jobs were not done by Bantu. In other words, notwithstanding all the apartheid policy we have had for 20 years, in fact we are finding that because there are no other people to these jobs in these various categories which he enumerated, the Bantu are being absorbed in them. Obviously, therefore, we are becoming more and more dependent, if one may use that word, upon their labour than has ever been the case, notwithstanding the attempts of the Government over all these years. Even in these five new categories in which he is now seeking power to prevent Natives from being employed, the Native people have been seeking employment, and now they are to be stopped by means of this provision. That quite clearly shows that they have been moving into further categories of work and obviously their numbers are increasing, both in the categories they have been in and in these new categories. So, I say, you have the clearest evidence in this provision that the Government knows that its own policy is failing. And let it of course not be inferred from what I have said that the Minister has power only to prevent employment in these five categories; the field is entirely open to him to prevent people from accepting employment and there is no limit upon it. The Minister justifies this by saying that it is preventing &#x201C;arbeidsintegrasie&#x201D;. Will he tell this House whether he intends to prevent Coloured people from taking these positions when they are surrendered by the Native people now in them? I ask the hon. the Minister before he leaves this House to make sure to tell us in his reply whether he is going to permit Coloureds and Indians to accept these jobs from which he says he is banning the Natives, or not, because <span class="col_1679-1680" refersTo="page_0854"/>if he is he must explain to me how it is &#x201C;arbeidsintegrasie&#x201D; in the case of the Native but not &#x201C;arbeidsintegrasie&#x201D; in the case of the Coloured and the Indian. And it will be very interesting to know whether the hon. member for Benoni, who was so upset at the present condition, will be equally upset of instead of finding a Bantu in the job to which he referred, he found a Coloured or an Indian. So the fact is that this clause, if and when it is put into operation, will not make a further extra white person available to take that employment. There is no unemployment among the Whites, nor indeed among the Coloureds, nor the Indians, as far as the figures show, but certainly not in the case of Whites and Coloureds. Consequently there will presumably be a vacuum, and what will there be then? There will be a contravention of this provision by people in sly ways, to which the hon. the Deputy Minister will turn a blind eye. This will continue just as much as there are contraventions continuing of all the other regulations passed by the Government.</p>

<p>I have here a report from <i>Die Burger</i> of a day or two ago showing that the number of Natives who are illegally in the Cape Town area has been increasing again by leaps and bounds, if one can be guided by the number charged with this offence. So, notwithstanding all the laws the Government has made, and the regulations, the contraventions are just becoming greater and greater. They are just bringing the whole question of law into disrepute. More and more people are just ignoring these regulations. I think it was the new Administrator of the Orange Free State who, before he left this House, said that the Native people did not have the vaguest idea of what all these laws and regulations are about and, if they did have, their only feeling about them was to try to circumvent them in some way. And we are now going to get these further regulations in regard to receptionists, telephonists and bar-tenders, etc., and I have not the slightest doubt that it will simply compel countless decent citizens, both White and non-White, to commit contraventions of these regulations in order that life can go on. It will be interesting indeed to see how the Government in fact uses this power. They have, of course, taken the power to grant exemptions. We know that in regard to job reservation they have granted exemptions until the original measure is quite unrecognizable. The hon. member for Hillbrow pointed out that in one category of job, which had been reserved exclusively for Whites, there were in fact, as the result of the exemptions, to-day only 6 per cent of Whites still in that category. I should certainly like to see, and we shall certainly probe very much, if it is still left to the hon. the Deputy Minister to control these affairs, how exactly he administers this measure; because one has a nasty suspicion that this is just window-dressing for the election, just to be able to say how the Government stands for apartheid in this respect and how the Opposition, who in fact have been bringing commonsense to bear upon it, do not see eye to eye with them on the point.</p>

<p>The third and last aspect of Government policy I want to mention is this one about home ownership and family life. It is well known that this party, in regard to the Native townships, believes that there is most definitely a place for home ownership and family life. In fact, this has been established in a place like Kwa Mashu in Durban. According to the Government, this is quite impossible, so what do we find? This self-same Kwa Mashu, while at present it is not in a Native area, is soon to be included in a Native area by changing the boundary and then, hey presto!, it will be perfectly legitimate under Government policy for those same people to have home ownership and family life. This is an absolutely crazy aspect of Government policy. They have to go to the lengths of carving out sovereign, independent states out of South Africa in order to give home ownership and family life in a place like Kwa Mashu to people who could have it perfectly happily and with no danger to South Africa without creating such sovereign, independent states. When one considers merely these three points I have mentioned, one realizes how this measure is doomed to failure. Perhaps just to avoid any misunderstanding, I should point out that the United Party certainly recognizes that there is a traditional division of South Africa; certain areas are reserved for the ownership of the Whites, and equally there are other areas that are reserved for the ownership of the Natives. This has been so from the beginning of time and it still remains United Party policy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I simply wish to say that the hon. members opposite are unfortunately using up the goodwill which exists between the races, and particularly between the white and the black races, by means of policies which have failed and are still failing. I do not know how long the people will tolerate a situation of this kind. I do not know how long hon. members opposite will still keep flogging a dead horse. It is well known that in the social, residential and recreational field the United Party stands for separation. It is well known, also, as I have indicated, that in regard to ownership of the land, the United Party stands for the Whites to have ownership in one area and for the Natives to have ownership in other areas. For hon. members opposite to suggest the contrary shows a complete misunderstanding of our policy. I am quite certain that South Africa therefore needs a change from this dead horse which is being flogged and flogged to a policy which will enable South Africa to go forward along sensible, commonsense lines. And I am hopeful that we will take a large step, or in the words of the astronauts, a giant step on 22nd April.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Before I come to the effect this legislation will have on the country, I should like to take the opportunity of congratulating the hon. the Deputy Minister on the very competent way he handled this <span class="col_1681-1682" refersTo="page_0855"/>legislation in the House. I want to tell him that I have discovered that he also has Job&#x2019;s patience, added to his other virtues, particularly with an Opposition that acted the way this one did during the Committee Stage. He displayed a great deal of patience and handled the Bill very skilfully, and to do so one most certainly needs the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon, not that they came to light with great pearls of wisdom, but you surely know that proverb of Solomon which you, Sir, would probably not allow me to quote or to apply to them. Therefore I say that the Minister deserves our sincere congratulations for the very competent way he has piloted this Bill through for us. However, I want to say that this Bill once more underlines a cardinal difference existing between the parties, a difference relating to the United Party view that we only have one nation in South Africa consisting of various races. This whole Bill has just brought that concept to the fore once more, a concept the hon. member for Houghton is not ashamed of and which she pleads for in public, for which I give her credit; but the United Party is extremely ashamed to plead for that concept when they get into the rural districts and the country outside, i.e. that they believe that we in South Africa are only a single nation with different races, and that there can be no discrimination or differentiation as regards that one nation. The United Party is extremely ashamed to admit that their policy is that we are one nation in South Africa consisting of various races. Correct? They are very quiet now. They say that in South Africa there is only one nation. That nation is, in fact, composed of various races and colours, but we in South Africa are only one nation. This party has another standpoint. This party states that we have one fatherland and that we are in the unique position that various peoples live here in South Africa in a common fatherland, and seen from that point of view this Bill was brought to the House of Assembly to once more arrange relationships between various peoples sharing a common fatherland. Now I ask the Opposition once more: Why are you opposing such a Bill when you do not have the courage to acknowledge and to accept this statement that I now made so openly? You believe in one nation in South Africa consisting of various races, and that that nation should be seen as a whole, and therefore governed under one type of legislation. Am I correct? Did I hear somebody there speak? No, Sir, you will not hear anyone speak. When one gets onto this subject those hon. members are as silent as the grave. That silence of theirs is still going to be their Party&#x2019;s grave; let me simply tell them that now.</p>

<p>Let me come back to a few of those hon. members and what they said. Let us listen to what the hon. member for Transkei said. With a flourish the hon. member said that he could not see why Bantu could not serve white people in all categories if they could do so in certain categories. To give an example, he sim ply cannot see why a Bantu cannot serve a white person across a bar counter when a Bantu man and a Bantu woman can serve a white person in his own house. Oh, Sir, how naive can adults not be at times, and adults, moreover, who do not live in a country where such conditions do not exist? I could still understand a person from England finding it strange for a Bantu to serve us in our houses and on our farms, but not across a bar counter. He may want to know whether it would then be such an unprecedented thing if he did, in fact, do so. I ask any thinking member on that side or, if I am flattering them too much, any hon. member opposite who ought to be able to think, whether they cannot see that there are various service categories and that the service relationship in the various work categories can differ? If hon. members opposite think they can get away with this kind of argument they are making the mistake of their lives; they are making a mistake if they think that our people will put up with their argument that if Bantu serve us in our houses and on the farms, they should also be allowed to do so in shops and in bars. There are many reasons why this should not be so, but unfortunately I do not have the necessary time at my disposal to go into it. It is actually ridiculous to enumerate reasons, and the hon. member for Transkei knows this as well as any of us.</p>

<p>We are trying to make it possible; this is the point we are aiming for. Since it is not possible as yet for Whites to serve Whites in certain categories, we leave a discretion and it is against this that hon. members opposite object so vehemently. As things become possible we leave it to the Minister and his Department to decide about that. But hon. members opposite want to have a fit about that. We are in the process of building out a pattern and everything cannot be done in one day. Hon. members opposite j cannot understand this. These things take time, I surely; it surely takes time to implement a <span class="col_1683-1684" refersTo="page_0856"/>policy in full. Here the Minister is requesting powers with which to do certain things in the course of time, as it becomes possible and necessary to do so. He is not coming along here with a measure that regulates everything once and for all, but with a permissive measure such as this.</p>

<p>I now come to a few things the hon. member for Houghton said. However, my time is very restricted and I must therefore hurry. The hon. member alleged that we are piloting this legislation through under pressure from the Hertzog group. But if the hon. member were to look at their benches she would see that there is not a single one of them present here. This shows what interest they have in this measure. They did not vote for this measure to be continued with &#x2026; oh yes, except one, and he only took part in the voting after we challenged him to take to his heels like the rest. But in the Committee Stage not one of them took part in any voting. Yet the hon. member said that we are piloting this measure through as a result of pressure from them. What absolute rubbish does that hon. member not speak at times!</p>

<p>The hon. member must be able to realize that if her allegation is true, members of the Herstigte Nasionale Party would at least have taken part in the discussion here, with a view to claiming some of the credit themselves for this measure. How childish can a person not be at times! It appears to me as if the hon. member has a very good, or a very incorrect, understanding of pressuring. We are not acting under pressure here. We are going ahead with this measure because we believe that it is in the interests of South Africa as well as the interests of each of the population groups. That is the only reason for this Bill. The hon. member also pointed out that we speak here of &#x201C;a way of life&#x201D; and she said that we should simply go out here and walk down the street to see what the true state of affairs is. Furthermore she said that in recent years there was no &#x201C;racial fiction&#x201D;, not that she was aware of. The hon. member for North Rand confirmed this. I now want to challenge him to accompany me to any mining constituency, for example mine. Let him go and ask the white people there what their standpoint is in respect of mixed labour. Of course there is friction. I also want to take him to the Coloured reserves so that he can find out what the Coloureds&#x2019; attitude about this matter is. The Coloured says that he believes in separate categories of work for the various population groups. If, then, the Minister now wants to remove certain groups of people from certain areas, this must eventually be to the advantage of the Coloured population. Thus it will also be in the interests of the Whites and the Bantu. That is the whole object of this legislation. And yet the United Party supported the hon. member for Hough ton&#x2019;s statements, as they usually do. In fact, when I asked him about that the hon. member for North Rand said that he did, in fact, assent to this.</p>

<p>There are quite a few points that the hon. member for Pinelands raised and about which I would like to have spoken if I had the time. But I do not have the time and shall therefore have to restrict myself to a few. He asked the Minister for an assurance that this measure would also be made applicable to Coloureds and Indians. But does the hon. member not know that this is the Minister of Bantu Administration and not of Coloured Affairs, and that it is his Department&#x2019;s task to regulate relationships as far as the Bantu are concerned? He must just have the decency to wait until the Minister of Coloured Affairs speaks here again; then he may ask him. The Minister will tell him that when the time is ripe and it is in the interests of South Africa, as this legislation is, he will also regulate relationships there. The hon. member surely knows this. This Government is solving our race relations in a peaceful manner. If the hon. member does not know this, I suppose I must tell him; I think he will believe me because he does sit in this House each day anyway. We are here dealing with the regulation of orderly race relations in South Africa. The United Party, on the other hand, understands nothing of that concept and never made it their own.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>That is not relevant at all. The Minister is engaged here in regulating relationships as far as the Bantu are concerned. When the time is ripe the hon. member may, with the greatest of pleasure, ask the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs what his standpoint is in this connection, and I am sure the hon. the Minister will give the <span class="col_1685-1686" refersTo="page_0857"/>hon. member a very satisfactory answer, one none of us will have to blush about.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the "arbitrary regulation of employment matters. He says that we act arbitrarily and that we leave it to the Minister to regulate these things. He thinks that people could thereby be without work. But the Minister is here taking both positive and negative steps. It is actually not relevant to this measure, but I want to point out that, on the other hand, the Minister is making arrangements for the Bantu to be assimilated into border industries and the Bantu homelands. Where the Bantu is too eager to follow the bright lights of the white man, the Minister will be empowered to say: &#x201C;No, steady on. You must rather go to those industries.&#x201D; He is definitely not going to throw them into the sea. Has that hon. member ever seen us act in that way? We surely always take both negative and positive action here in South Africa. And we always tackle the positive aspects first, before coming to the negative ones. This is surely the way this Government has always acted throughout the years. Surely this is not a United Party Government!</p>

<p>The question may be asked about what the effects of this measure are going to be on relationships in South Africa. This Government has worked out a race pattern, a pattern which is accepted throughout South Africa as the race pattern for South Africa. This legislation envisages the promotion of that pattern. Therefore we are proud to be able to vote for the Third Reading of this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Namakwaland made a rather interesting statement. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he agrees with what he said. The hon. member said that one of the most positive aspects of this Bill is to stop the Bantu going to industries. Sir, is that correct? Does the hon. the Deputy Minister agree? I shall be very interested to hear his point of view, because the hon. the Deputy Minister has not mentioned industries throughout the whole course of the debate on this Bill. He has tried to imply to this House that it is not going to affect industry. Now it appears that the cat has been let out of the bag. I wonder what the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to say to that?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Namakwaland also said that, for a Black to serve a White is very bad, but for a White to serve a Black is not so bad, and is permissible until such time as a solution can be found. But nobody on that side has said anything about what is happening on the other side of the counter, the public&#x2019;s side of the counter, where Black and White mix. Who serves which, or is the implication to be drawn from what that hon. member and other hon. members have said, that this is the beginning of apartheid in trade? I have asked this question before of the hon. the Minister of Justice, and of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, and they have denied that there is any intention on the part of this Government to introduce separate shops for separate race groups. If the arguments of these hon. members are taken to their logical conclusion, this is exactly what it means. It will mean that the Government is going to compel traders to have separate shops for separate race groups.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that in his constituency, which he claims to be a mining constituency, one will find innumerable cases of complaints or objections against what he called &#x201C;deurmekaar werk&#x201D;. Sir, I want that hon. member to mention to me one job, apart from that which we, in our privileged position in this House, enjoy, which is not integrated in South Africa. Do the miners not work side by side with non-Whites underground? Do they not help each other in emergencies? When there have been cave-ins and when there have been tragedies, have they not worked side by side as brothers to help each other? That hon. member must not make such statements. Every single Department of the Government service is mixed. In every single Office in South Africa the races are mixed. One does not find Whites only. Only we, in our privileged position here in this centre of South Africa, in Parliament, do not have a mixed community in the field of work we do.</p>

<p>Sir, what is the effect of this Bill going to be? It affects three statutes. We have had the discussion on the Bantu Trust and Land Act. The Government will now take over the townships in the urban areas. I want the hon. the Minister please to take note of my next point, because there is still some doubt as to whether the new provisions in clauses I and 2 are subject to the provisions of section 10 (2) of the Act, with regard to the question of adjoining land. I have had different opinions from different legal experts on this point, and I hope he will look into this matter. Of course, it does not really matter, because we already have the position where the Government will purchase a corridor &#x2026;</p>

If the Deputy Minister is right, and the provisions of section 10 (2) of the Bantu Trust and Land Act do not apply, where it is laid down that only land which is adjacent to land belonging to the Trust can be purchased, then it means that they can take any township for this purpose.

<p>The Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act is also amended, and it has become quite clear that the object has been the violation of the rights which Bantu enjoyed under section 10. Of course, we are now going to find that this Government will be in the position to use the excuse of slum clearance and &#x201C;threats to health&#x201D; to remove the Bantu from the urban areas. The National Housing Commission, the Department of Bantu Administration and Nationalist-controlled local authorities can now all escape their obligations, namely their duty to provide adequate housing, because that hon. Deputy Minister and his Department are going to provide the housing somewhere in some homeland.</p>

<p>We shall also find the position where a Bantu, who remains in a township after deproclamation in order to protect his rights under section 10 of this Act, can be summarily removed on the strength of a warrant issued by a Bantu Affairs Commissioner. That warrant will be issued on affidavits placed before him. It will be an arbitrary decision. The Bantu himself will have no opportunity of appearing to defend himself and to state his case. All provisions for compensation will of course have been removed as well. I say that this is autocratic and authoritarian. We also find that it is going to be made even more difficult to keep Bantu in the urban areas, and that it will be made more uncomfortable for them to remain there, because no longer need one-third of the Bantu beer profits be spent on amenities in the urban areas. What will the effect of this be? The Whites of South Africa will continue to allow the Bantu to come into the urban areas to keep the wheels of commerce and industry going. We know that we need them. We know that we cannot operate without them, but it will no longer be made comfortable for them. They are going to have to leave their families behind. They will not be allowed to have their families in the urban areas, and they will not even have any social or recreational amenities to entertain themselves at times when they are not working. That is the effect of this Bill.</p>

<p>That hon. member has not entered into this debate at all. It is no good his making remarks now. He knows nothing about it.</p>

<p>The Bantu Labour Act has also been amended. The Deputy Minister, when he introduced clause 11, told us that it was his intention to assist the economy and not to harm it. He told us that the intention was purely the prevention of labour integration. Then the hon. member for Benoni said that this applied only when Black and White work side by side in the same job. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister agree with that statement? Can a white shopkeeper in a white area employ only Bantu employees? Will he be permitted to do that? I want to refer to my own experience in this regard. For years we have had shops in white areas being patronized by both Bantu and Whites and having both Bantu and white staff. These shops provide separate amenities. For years we have also had supermarkets where Bantu and white check-out operators work side by side at the check-outs. Do the Bantu and white customers in those supermarkets automatically segregate themselves? Do you find that the white customers only go to the white check-out operators and that the Bantu customers only go to the Bantu checkout operators? No, Sir, this is not the position. My own experience is that they go to the most efficient operators, whether that operator is a white person or a Bantu, and this is how it should be allowed to continue. This is absolute nonsense.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I want to thank the hon. members for Koedoespoort, Harrismith and Namakwaland very sincerely for the positive contributions they made during this debate. While I am thanking them I also want to convey my sincere thanks to the hon. members on this side of the House who made their contribution during the Committee Stage, which was so long drawn out. I wish I could say the same to the hon. Opposition. As far as this Bill, and particularly as far as clause 11, which was supposedly so contentious, is concerned, the Opposition has without any doubt at all been taken in tow for the past 12 months by the integrationists, the liberalists and the Black Sash of this country. I shall <span class="col_1689-1690" refersTo="page_0859"/>prove this, but before I do so, I first want to deal with the three allegations which were made here this morning during the Third Reading of this Bill. The first allegation is that this Bill, and particularly clause 11, is allegedly a so-called &#x201C;vote of no confidence&#x201D; in the Minister of Labour. I want to deal with all three simultaneously. The second allegation is that we are now coming to light with this Bill shortly before an election and that it is supposedly an election expedient. The third allegation is that the Hertzog-U.P. forced us into this position. These are the three allegations I quickly want to deal with in one go. I want to quote to the hon. members from a letter from the Department of Labour. The House must remember now that we are dealing here with a so-called motion of no confidence in the Minister of Labour, that we have come to light with this measure before an election and that the Hertzog-U.P. has taken us in tow. I now want to quote to those hon. members from a letter from the Secretary of Labour to the Secretary of Bantu Administration and Development in regard to the Bantu Labour Amendment Bill. This was in 1968. The letter reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your reference numbers 113/49 of 28th October, 1968, refer. Arising out of more or less similar provisions which were contained in the draft stage of the Bantu Labour Act, 1964, this Department (the Department of Labour) indicated in its official letter No. CT1060 of 25th April, 1963 &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was seven years ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in reply to the Secretary of Bantu Labour&#x2019;s letter No. 1132/32 of 22 <i>idem</i>, that control over Bantu labour can best be handled by legislation which is administered by you (the Department of Bantu Administration and Development). Although there will be a degree of duplication with the work reservation provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act (Act No. 28 of 1965), no serious practical problems are foreseen in this regard. As a result this Department (the Department of Labour) has no objection to 7 (a) &#x2026;</block>

<p>This has now become clause 11 in this Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of the envisaged Bill.</block>

<p>Surely it is not possible for one to furnish a clearer, more adequate reply to the ridiculous allegations made on that side. But I can substantiate this even further. I have referred to the fact that questions were asked about this at congresses long before anything like a Hertzog-U.P. appeared on the horizon. In 1963 there was nothing of this ilk. In 1964&#x2014;I have the resolution here in my hand&#x2014;the following resolution was adopted at a congress of the National Party in the Transvaal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The congress requests the Government to apply apartheid more strictly in respect of Bantu women who must be prohibited from serving Whites behind counters. An objection must be raised to the fact that the practice of having Whites served across counters by Bantu is on the increase.</block>

<p>A similar draft resolution, with more or less the same purpose, was subsequently adopted by congresses on various occasions. Therefore, to make this kind of allegation here, simply does not hold water.</p>

<p>But now hon. members on that side of the House have gone much further than that. They tried to present this clause 11, to which I first want to confine myself now, in a ridiculous light. I want to say to this House this morning, and I mean this honestly when I say it, that I, who must accept joint responsibility for the Bantu and the interests of the Bantu in the Republic of South Africa and who must maintain good race relations here, have on more than one occasion literally felt grieved when I was forced to read and when I was forced to hear in these debates about the atrocious and irresponsible statements which have been made in regard to this matter during the past year and more. I just want to read a single example of this. It is dated 23rd March, 1969, deals with clause 11, and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Protest against naked power: It conferred power to control industry and commerce, power to close factories, power to terminate employment contracts and power to put an end to domestic labour. This Bill gives the Minister power to detain in rural settlements Africans who transgress the pass laws and power to subject them to forced labour. This grotesque Bill &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the word which has been used repeatedly during the past few months&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is the most cynical subversion of human beings into labour units that Nationalist power has ever produced.</block>

<p>This is not yet the end, because it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It depersonalizes and dehumanizes. It creates slave labour in the Republic of South Africa. It holds all employees in chains.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not think one can find words strong enough to condemn this kind of irresponsibility. And then hon. members on that side still have the temerity to accuse this side of the House in an acrimonious manner of marring racial harmony in South Africa with this Bill. Only yesterday, and with that I want to let what I have said in respect of this matter suffice, a report appeared in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> with the headline &#x201C;It&#x2019;s cruel&#x201D;. In that report the following passage appears, namely &#x201C;to deprive non-Whites in South Africa of their dignity; to reduce them even further in the official mind towards the level of cattle&#x201D;. With all the contempt <span class="col_1691-1692" refersTo="page_0860"/>I can muster, I reject this statement and take it extremely amiss of the hon. the Opposition for what they have tried to do in regard to this Bill and specifically in regard to clause 11. They did this after they had become conversant with what clause 11 really deals with, and why it is absolutely necessary to place clause 11 on the Statute Book. I consequently maintain that the hon. Opposition has been taken in tow by these extreme integrationistic, left-wing and liberal elements and before they could come to their senses they were brought up short by this Bill. It was no longer possible for them to go back and they were forced to go forward. After having explained carefully to them what clause 11 involved and what the effect of clause 11 was going to be, I can put the following question to hon. members opposite: Do they think that I will occupy this position in order to collaborate in slanderous things of this kind which we are so acrimoniously being accused of? Do they think that I will occupy this position in order to do something which would disrupt racial harmony? Do they think that I will occupy this position and will collaborate in doing something to make the Bantu here in South Africa dissatisfied or to do them an injustice? Do they think that I will occupy this position in order to do something which will harm Whites in this country? We pride ourselves on doing precisely the opposite. Now what are the facts of this matter? I do not want to humiliate myself by arguing on that level with hon. members opposite, but want to hurl, in their midst, without further ado, the question of what they would do if they should come into power. Will they then abolish work reservation? Will they, if they should come into power, after this Bill has been placed on the Statute Book, the effect of which will be that it will not be possible to employ a Bantu woman in a bar to serve white men, blithely allow this to happen? Is that what hon. members opposite want? Is that what hon. members opposite are advocating? It cannot be prevented under any other Act. That is why hon. members opposite have been kicking up all this dust. I explained very carefully to hon. members opposite that this clause is not a work reservation clause. This clause 11 has nothing to do, and the hon. member for Houghton made this assertion again this morning, with putting a stop to labour competition in South Africa. For that purpose we have section 77 of the Industrial Reconciliation Act. This clause deals with one matter only, i.e. to put a stop to labour integration where it creates social problems and where it can lead to racial friction. That is what the clause envisages, and nothing more. I have also proved this.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall reply to that further, but this is the first point which must be stated. The hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs has jurisdiction over Coloureds, and we have jurisdiction over Bantu. As far as the Bantu are concerned, with the multinational set-up we have in the Republic of South Africa in respect of Bantu, we must put a stop to this process in time, as I showed very clearly. Secondly, this measure is very definitely in the interests of the Bantu as well. If my criterion, i.e. since it can create social problems and since it can give rise to racial friction is correct, surely it is in the interests of the Bantu that this should not happen. I discussed clause 11 with Bantu leaders. I explained here in the House the other day how we discussed this <b>matter with Bantu very</b> frankly. I can give hon. members the assurance that the Bantu understand it. One is grateful for the fact that they do not believe the accusations being made by that side of the House against this clause. The hon. member for Houghton again said here this morning that &#x201C;we are going to kick them out of their jobs&#x201D;. But the Bantu know that that is not the case. They know that they are not going to lose their work as a result of this legislation on the scale hon. members gave out it would take place here. I now want to carry on with my reply to the statements made by the hon. member for Pinelands, and say that this matter is also in the interests of the Bantu. The Bantu in the various categories of work I mentioned and in respect of whom this legislation will be put into operation in the first place, are Bantu whose services are urgently required in the homelands, as well as in the border areas. We know this from experience. Therefore it is also specifically to the benefit of the Bantu. Those hon. members must not be so irresponsible as to bring the Bantu in this country under the wrong impression in this way in respect of what is being envisaged with this legislation, as they are doing at present.</p>

<from><span class="col_1693-1694" refersTo="page_0861"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have already told the hon. member that this is a matter which falls under the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs and other relevant Ministers. In this connection I want to refer the hon. members on that side of the House to a question which was put a short while ago during this short Session by one of the hon. Opposition members and to which the hon. the Minister of Labour and Coloured Affairs gave a specific reply. They know well what that reply was. His reply was that he had instructed his Department to investigate this question and that he was waiting on the results and findings of that investigation. I am prepared to go even further. That hon. member must not think that I am running away from giving a reply. [Interjections.] That hon. member is not giving me a chance to reply. I do not intend running away from his question. In my own mind I am quite convinced that clause 11 of this Bill will be applied with the necessary responsibility. In view of this and also in view of the investigation ordered by the hon. the Minister of Labour and of Coloured Affairs in regard to this matter I can only say that we will most certainly do everything in our power to ensure that owing to social reasons which may create problems and also owing to possible racial friction which could be created in the process no Coloured or Indian will be appointed to the position from which a Bantu has been removed. In co-operation with the hon. the Minister of Labour and Coloured Affairs, this will be our purpose and endeavour. Why are hon. members on that side of the House not croaking and clucking now after I have given them a very honest and very straight answer? What is wrong with that? We on this side of the House believe in separate development and we believe in apartheid. We want to apply this in an honest, just, fair and humane manner. Let there be no doubt about that. The discussions on this clause indicated irrefutably that that side of the House, in spite of what they may say and in spite of their, actions, do not believe in apartheid. That is why from the very outset&#x2014;and this has been for more than a year&#x2014;they have put up such a prodigious resistance to this clause. That is why they took so much trouble to go out of their way to try to present this matter in an absolutely false light and to try to blazon the most grotesque, if I may use that word, misrepresentations of this Bill abroad. That, we think, is very, very wrong.</p>

<p>I should now like to return to the Hertzog-U.P. in connection with this matter. I should like to state very plainly here this morning that we on this side of the House will not allow ourselves to be taken in tow by the Hertzog-U.P. as far as this matter is concerned. When this matter was previously being discussed and we were engaged in a fierce struggle with the Opposition in this House in order to get this Bill through, they were conspicuous by their absence. They were not even present in the voting. I want to repeat that we will not allow ourselves to be taken in tow by them. There is another matter I cannot allow to go unanswered. The hon. member for Transkei was most insistent here that an enquiry was necessary in regard to the provisions of section 77 of the Industrial Reconsiliation Act. I want to point out to him that we made provision to obviate the possibility of issuing a promulgation in no time at all and summarily. That is why clause 11 now reads, after the amendment which was introduced and accepted here, that the Minister shall give at least one month&#x2019;s prior notice of his intention in the <i>Gazette</i>. For what reason does the hon. member think I introduced that amendment?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Why did I insert it? It is being provided here that he shall give a month&#x2019;s prior notice of his intention in order to enable employers, if they have objections or problems, to come forward with those problems and difficulties. The hon. member wants to blazon the allegation abroad that we merely want to make a wild announcement regardless of whether it will cause difficulties in the country&#x2019;s economy, regardless of whether it embarrasses the Bantu, and regardless of what the results of that might be. We on this side of the House are responsible. We will not do things like that, and that hon. member must not make such irresponsible statements here in the House.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal, finally, with the contention made here by the hon. member for Houghton. I cannot let such a contention go unanswered. She contended that Dr. Rieckert in his lecture to the Institute of Race Relations had no hope that we would be able to keep in the Bantu homelands even the increase in the number of Bantu there. I want to refer the hon. member to page 21 of his lecture. He stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This would require that 24 per cent, 17 per cent or 5 per cent respectively of South Africa&#x2019;s industrial development (including construction) will have to be channeled to the homelands or border areas.</block>

<p>He then comes to the conclusion that we are reaching that point. I am quoting again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The point of time when the average of 17 per cent will be achieved will of course depend on the rate at which the implementation of the policy of decentralization progresses. Economic growth is of course always and in all countries a long-term process, but even the 24 per cent as an ultimate target does not appear to be out of reach in the longer run.</block>

<p>Therefore the hon. member&#x2019;s contention is devoid of all truth. I want to let this, then, suffice.</p>

<p>I just want to reply very briefly to the question which the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) put to me before lunch. I have, in fact, already replied to it. Section 10 (2) of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, is very clear; it deals only with the purchase of land adjacent to a Bantu homeland, and therefore clauses 1 and 2 of this Bill have no direct implications as far as section 10 (2) of the Bantu Trust and Land Act is concerned. The reply is therefore very clear in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to conclude by pointing out that the Opposition did everything in their power last year to present this Bill as a grotesque measure, as a measure which is going to deprive the Bantu of their employment here in South Africa, as a measure which gives dictatorial powers to the Minister, and as a measure which is going to have even worse consequences. In this debate they have tried to present this measure as a ridiculous one.

You see, Sir, this particular Bill deals with artisans and those people who come under the industrial councils. It does not cover a wide sphere. You will remember, Sir, that the Bill introduced by the hon. member for Hillbrow covered a very much wider field. But the fact that the Minister has introduced this Bill does show the necessity of having some measure on our Statute Book in terms of which we can have a board or some organization to undertake the task of training the manpower of our country to enable them to play their full part in this rapidly developing country of ours. As I have said, this Bill does not provide for a scheme of training; it only gives the power to the Minister and to the industrial councils to raise funds from employers and employees by means of collections. No provision is made anywhere in this Bill for any scheme of training; that has to be organized by the committees of the industrial councils. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether a new principle has not been imported into this particular Bill in clause 2 (a) (d), which talks about &#x201C;the establishment of a body to administer such fund and the appointment by the Minister of persons to represent on such body the employers and employees upon whom any provisions of the agreement are under this paragraph declared binding, in a notice published under paragraph (a) or (b) or by notice in the <i>Gazette </i>&#x2026;&#x201D;. Sir, that is a departure because under the Industrial Conciliation Act the Minister does appoint various commissions and so on but where you have an industrial agreement, the Minister does not appoint anybody to these committees; that is done by the industrial councils concerned under section 25. I do not therefore understand what the Minister&#x2019;s intention is here. This is a complete departure from the existing position because the Minister is now going to have some say in the appointment of the people who are going to administer this trust fund. That is all they are going to do; they are simply going to administer this trust fund. Under the restriction in clause 25 he can only appoint an employer or an employee, neither of whom may be an educationist; so this particular committee may not be the sort of committee that he wants. The people who are going to administer the trust fund must have the necessary knowledge and must be able to decide what course of training the apprentice must undergo. There is no doubt that while meeting a requirement, this Bill at the same time leaves a gap which the Government is not filling. On their own initiative SEIFSA and the motor trade, have over the years, with the co-operation of their employees, been able to raise these funds purely voluntarily in order to be able to provide this training. The Government have failed here. As I have said, we have this gap between labour and education. It seems to me an unbridgeable gap. Over the years I have never seen it bridged yet. But there is a necessity to have some committee or board which is going to take care of the training of our technicians and not only our technicians but workers in dozens of other spheres of activity in this country. But making use of the industrial councils, the Government does serve a purpose but I do not think that this is the correct vehicle for the fulfilment of this function.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the discussion of this Bill up to now there is one impression we gained, i.e. the very important fact that as far as labour matters are concerned the liberal wing of the United Party has taken over this section on behalf of the United Party. This is a fact which we must not fail to bring to the attention of the voters outside in particular. For what have we found in this discussion so far? The two speakers on the United Party side who participated in this debate sang the praises of the Bill which the hon. member for Hillbrow submitted to this House last year. In addition to all the things envisaged in it, that Bill has one important objective and that is to facilitate labour integration. I maintain that that is why the impression must remain that the United Party&#x2019;s liberal group have now taken over Labour on behalf of the U.P., and we must emphasize this.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Salt River, who has just resumed his seat, went a little further. He came to light here with all kinds of accusations such as &#x201C;The hon. member did this House a disservice when he started to bring colour in here&#x201D;, as he said on Friday. But what are the true facts? Who are the people who brought colour into this debate? If we look at what the hon. member for Musgrave, who opened the debate, said, we see in column 933 that he states that the Bill does not deal with all the workers; for example, it does not deal with the Bantu at all and a little further on he says; "&#x2026; a Bill which is aimed at the proper training of manpower for the future needs of South Africa should include the proper training of all workers (regardless of colour).&#x201D; Now the hon. member for Salt River comes along and states that it is the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark who dragged colour into this debate. But surely it is feat liberal hon. member for Musgrave who first tried to turn this debate into a colour debate. The hon. member for Hillbrow says the same thing. When it comes to labour matters he states in <i>The Star</i>, 27th May, 1968&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The manpower of all races should be developed to its full potential.</block>

<p>It is they who want to drag colour into this.</p>

<p><span class="col_1699-1700" refersTo="page_0864"/>The hon. member for Salt River said that the workers in this country were tired of politics in the trade unions. What did he mean by that? He ought to know that it is in fact this National Party Government which has always made a point of keeping party politics out of the trade unions, and the United Party cannot deny that. But what is in fact true is that the United Party are the people who try each time, here and elsewhere, to make out a case for party politics in the trade unions. We do not deny, as far as politics as such is concerned where it deals with the key to the survival of the worker and the Whites in this country, that this is a matter to which this side of the House has always given attention. I am emphasizing politics and not party politics.</p>

<p>But this legislation now before the House must be welcomed for it remedies an injustice because employers are now being compelled to contribute to the costs of training workers if they employ that specific category of worker, or if the employer falls into another category as that for which the training scheme was introduced, made provision for them. Even in the case of industries which are not organized under an industrial council they are now being afforded an opportunity of organizing training schemes on a group basis. This we have already indicated through the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark and this serves as a reply to one of the most important objections by the hon. member for Musgrave.</p>

<p>But then the hon. member for Salt River came to light and thought he was going to rub salt in the wounds his predecessor tried to inflict. He tried to make out a case, also on the basis of last years draft Bill of the hon. member for Hillbrow, that the industrial councils should not be encumbered with the training and education of manpower. But surely it was never the intention that this should be so. The truth of the matter is after all that these industrial councils are only instrumental in getting training schemes introduced and enforcing them, and that matter is being re-emphasized in this Bill. But as far as training itself is concerned, this Government is ensuring, and has been doing so over the years, that proper provision is made for the training of our people. I just want to illustrate this on the basis of a few particulars. It is interesting to note that in the past 20 years the number of technical colleges has increased from less than 10 to 26, and the total number of vocational schools from fewer than 20 to 81. In addition six technological institutes were established. Surely this is proof that it is for this Government a matter of great importance to supply trade and industry with well-equipped people. Where does the hon. member come from to try to make out a case here that this Government has overlooked those very important matters? Surely that is not so. To sum up therefore there is only one conclusion one can arrive at. It is that everyone who means well with the manpower in this country and who means well with our economic progress must support this legislation, and that is why it is for me a pleasure to add my support as well.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Springs will pardon me if I do not react to what he has said. It seems to me that he was just practicing for the election which lies ahead and he in no way discussed this particular Bill.</p>

<p>Those of us who are interested in manpower development and in the training of our workers of course looked forward with great expectation and interest to see how the Government was going to deal with this particular problem. Here we now have before us this specific instrument, this legislation, and I think it is our task to determine to what extent this legislation is going to comply with the requirements set.</p>

<p>Let me say at once that our approach is that this legislation is completely inadequate. After all the expectations which were roused in us we really feel that this is an anticlimax. Surely, the mountain conceived and bore a mouse. If this legislation is an indication of anything at all, it indicates that at long last the Government at least recognizes that a problem has arisen and that at long last here we have an attempt by the Government to try to solve the problem. I should therefore like to react to this legislation and to the matters submitted to us by the hon. the Minister, and since I am now the last speaker on this side of the House on this matter, I can do this more or less by way of summary.</p>

<p>The first point which is quite obvious to us is that when the hon. the Minister and the hon. members opposite who echo him talk about training it is clear that their horizons are extremely confined. When they talk about training they think chiefly of the training of apprentices. This is in fact the way the hon. the Minister motivated it for us when he put it to us; he said that he was concerned about the training of apprentices, that he had had the matter investigated and that he wanted very much to improve the training of apprentices. Here we now have the result in this legislation before us. I readily concede that apprenticeship training will be encouraged by this Bill, for it will bring just a little more money into circulation, and of course we welcome that. But our standpoint throughout had been that apprenticeship training forms a very small subdivision of our training problem. Surely we all know that the purpose of training is to increase productivity, and all the research which has ever been done in this country and elsewhere, indicates that where an increase in productivity is brought about, 80 per cent of such improvement in productivity stems from the management and from the technicians. It is the people who work with their heads rather than those who work with their hands who effect improvements in productivity.</p>

<p>As we see the matter, there is absolutely nothing in this legislation which is going to <span class="col_1701-1702" refersTo="page_0865"/>give us more managers and which is going to result in more highly skilled technicians. This is legislation which is chiefly aimed at improving apprenticeship training somewhat, and in this sense it is probably adequate, but as far as the overall South African problem is concerned, it is totally inadequate. Even when we think of apprentices, the skilled part in our industries, they are at this stage only contributing 13 per cent of the people who are economically active in South Africa. Artisans are of course only a small subdivision of this skilled group in industry, and apprentices are again only a small subdivision of this group of artisans. This therefore gives an idea of how far this legislation extends and what contribution it will be able to make here.</p>

<p>But as I have said, it is in fact on the higher levels, among our managerial corps, that we have such a shortage. Dr. Frikkie Meyer of Iscor recently made such a survey and he suggested that South Africa should have at least 500,000 people on the managerial level. When we examine the census figures for 1960 we see that we only just have 200,000, so that there is a tremendous gap which has to be filled here, and we see absolutely nothing in this legislation which is going to give us more managers.</p>

<p>But this legislation is only applicable to the industries, and we ourselves know that two-thirds of the economically active people in South Africa are completely removed from the industrial sphere. What about our service sector, and what about commercial life? Does the hon. the Minister not want these people to be trained as well? But even when we consider the industrial level, what about the mining industry? The mining industry, as far as I know, does not have an industrial council, and I accept then that they will fall outside the ambit of this legislation. What about the agricultural sector, which is one of the largest employers in our country? The agricultural sector does not have an industrial council, and as far as I can understand from this legislation they also fall outside the ambit of the measures which are being adopted here. I hope that when the hon. the Minister replies to the debate, he will indicate to us whether or not the mining and the agricultural industries fall outside the ambit of this legislation.</p>

<p>But we must not merely consider the problem as it exists at present; we must also look a little distance into the future. Here we are on the eve of tremendous developments in South Africa. We are being told that there are approximately 2 million people in South Africa who have had, or should have had, some kind of training or other. The indications are that by the end of this decade, in 1980, there will be at least 3 million people who should have had some kind of training or other. I hope the hon. Minister is listening to what I am saying now. There are then at least 1 million people who will have to receive some or other form of training during the next ten years. We also know that of all the different kinds of work which exist to-day, almost two-thirds will not even exist by the end of the century; it will be something of the past. Computers and all these tremendous changes in technology will change completely our different kinds of work. So here we are, on the eve of a great leap ahead, a new era we are entering, a new technological century, and we should have liked the Minister to have come forward here with a measure which would have been of assistance to South Africa in going forward to meet the future, but what do we find here? A piece of patchwork. That is what we have here. He has taken existing legislation and added on a piece. Then he sat back and is quite satisfied that he has now made a great contribution to the solution of this problem, but we merely have a piece of patchwork here. I stand amazed as hon. members opposite tell us how far ahead we are with our training and how good our training is, as that hon. member has just done. But do they not read what people like <i>Volkshandel</i> are saying? Six months ago <i>Volkshandel</i> said that instead of South African being ahead of the rest of the world as far as industrial training was concerned, we are a quarter of a century behind the rest of the world. What we needed here and what the Minister should have come forward with is a new kind of vehicle to push us ahead into the new century; he should have used a jet aircraft, or if that was too fast for him, he could have brought a helicopter so that we would still have had some mobility and could have shot forward, but now he is coming forward here with a horse and cart measure, for that is all we have here. In this debate it was frequently asked whether it is the Whites who must be trained or whether it is the non-Whites who must undergo training. I think we ought to go into this matter. Let me say at once that the training of White is absolutely essential. At the present stage the Whites represent only 20 per cent of the people who are economically active in South Africa. However, they are filling more than two-thirds of all the highly skilled positions. The burden resting upon the Whites and the contribution which they have to make is therefore already one of great magnitude. I think it is true to say that the human capacity of the Whites is already being stretched to such an extent that it is a cause for concern. This will become further aggravated for as I have just indicated, there is a continual change in our work setup. Let us take the top group, which is usually called the professional, technical or administrative group, as an example. This group at present comprises 5 per cent of the economically active people in South Africa. It is calculated with at within 10 years, i.e. by 1980, this percentage will be 7. The skilled group in our industries, which at present amounts to 13 per cent, will by 1980 be 20 per cent. From the nature of the case the Whites will therefore have to be doing more and more work of high calibre. We readily accept therefore that the training of our Whites must continually be expanded.</p>

<p><span class="col_1703-1704" refersTo="page_0866"/>I now come to the question of non-Whites. Each time we on this side of this House talk about training, we are charged with wanting to have the non-Whites trained. I therefore want to put a specific question to the hon. the Minister. Is it that he does not want non-Whites to be trained? Is the policy of this Government that non-Whites should not be trained? The hon. member for Turffontein, who from time to time comes to light as an asker of questions, asks whether we would be prepared to introduce legislation to restrict training to Whites. I am asking the hon. the Minister whether this is the policy of his Government, i.e. that only Whites should be trained? The hon. the Minister does not reply.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell the hon. the Minister what he said in the Other Place. The hon. the Minister indicated there that this Government was doing more for the training of non-Whites than any government had ever done before. That is what he said in the Other Place. He boasted with that, and he is of course quite right. That is what is so strange about the Government. When they sit here and are protected, they talk about the wonderful things they are doing for the non-Whites. But when they appear outside on a political platform we are charged with being the people who want to train the non-Whites. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Affairs recently indicated how much the Government was doing. He spoke about all the trade schools which were being built for the training of non-Whites. He set out a whole series of these things to indicate how much the Government was really doing. From the nature of the case non-Whites have to be trained. Let me put it like this. Training of non-Whites is taking place at the moment. Is it the policy of the hon. the Minister and that of the Government to put a stop to the training which is taking place at present, no matter how inadequate or spasmodically? To use one of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own phrases, it would surely be &#x201C;foolishness of the worst degree&#x201D; to propose something like that.</p>

<p>But let us consider this matter a little further. At this stage the non-Whites already represent 80 per cent of the people employed in our industries. It is generally accepted that even in the top group, to wit the professional, technical or administrative group, 40 per cent will in ten years consist of non-Whites. Is it the policy of this Government that under these circumstances non-Whites should not be trained? The Government remains indebted to us for a reply. But if it is the policy of the Government to train non-Whites, as the hon. the Minister said in his speech the other day and as was also said by his colleagues, why did he introduce this specific instrument with which to do so? We have here an amendment to the Industrial Conciliation Act. The principal Act, and hon. members will recall, de fines all the various groups. But when they come to Bantu they state that the Bantu is not an employee. What else a Bantu could be when he is employed by me and works for me, I really do not know. However, the Act states that he is not an employee. Oh well, we have very strange laws in this country. In the preamble, as well as in clause 3 of this amending Bill, it is provided that employees must be trained. However, according to the principal Act a Bantu is not an employee. Does this then not mean that in terms of the provisions of this Bill the Bantu in South Africa may not be trained, not in industries either? The hon. the Minister will have to furnish us with an explanation of this. If this is the case, this legislation is in fact so inadequate and so out of touch with the requirements of South Africa, that it really causes one great concern.</p>

<p>The instrument which the hon. the Minister is using is not the right one for the purpose he has in mind. I should like to motivate this in another way as well. The principal Act provides quite definitely that these industrial councils have been established to settle disputes, disputes between employers and employees. Anyone of us who has any knowledge of this kind of problem, knows that from the nature of the case one has people here who are absorbed into the process of negotiation. In the choice of people to serve on those councils one makes use of people who have knowledge of industrial legislation and people who will be able to participate in this process of negotiation. There is a specific atmosphere at the discussions of these groups, a specific ethos which sets certain limits. According to this legislation it is provided that these people should undertake the training. Here totally different capacities are being asked for. You need people who have knowledge of training, people who are aware of the latest developments in the field of training and who will know what is meant by programmed training and what teaching aids and all these kind of things mean. The kind of people who normally serve on these councils have no knowledge of this whatsoever. A task is now being entrusted to them which is quite beyond their scope. It is true that clause 2 provides that a body can be established in order to deal with the funds. Now I should like to know from the hon. the Minister who the people are whom he is going to appoint in accordance with the provisions of this Bill. Are they people who have knowledge of training, or are they a lot of accountants? Is it their task simply to regulate the funds? Are they going to make a contribution to the fundamental problem, that of training? Our standpoint is that when one has to deal with a training problem one must appoint people who have technical knowledge of training. When we put it in this way to the hon. the Minister he said that we merely wanted to apply a British method to South Africa which would not work in any case. How does the hon. the Minister know that it will not work? Has he ever been there? Has he ever sent any of his Officers across to <span class="col_1705-1706" refersTo="page_0867"/>find out what is going on there? Where does he get his information from to say that it does not work? I can inform the House that the British Government has told me that if they had not followed this kind of approach they would have been in a far greater economic difficulty than they are at present. I want to quote a section from <i>Volkshandel</i> of November, 1969, specifically from a leading article by the editor. I take it at least that this is an indication of what <i>Volkshandel</i> thinks. This particular article ends, in heavy black print, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This system &#x2026;</block>

<p>he is referring now to the British approach&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of expanding in factory training is already being applied with great success overseas and in particular in Britain.</block>

<p>I would much prefer to believe <i>Volkshandel</i> than the standpoint the hon. the Minister put before us, i.e. that it is not working in Britain. I want to ask the hon. the Minister who says this.</p>

<p>Wait just a minute. I shall reply to you. Just give me a chance. When this specific Officer thinks of training, he also thinks only of apprenticeship training. I went to all the British councils, such as the British Engineering Council and the chemical council and asked them whether they had ever seen the specific man, the Minister&#x2019;s expert there, and nobody in Britain had ever met him. I therefore do not know where he acquired his knowledge. He probably sat somewhere in an Office and then wrote his report. Here we now have an approach to the problem which is not only being followed by the British. The Dutch and Germans are doing this and now the Americans want to introduce it. Then the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark says to me that I am a copycat. I think that if one copies, if you know how to copy, it is not at all a bad idea. The hon. member, I think, will not even know where to begin. The hon. the Minister quoted from &#x201C;Industries in South Africa&#x201D; and, <i>inter alia</i>, told us that the British system was not applicable here, and that what had been proposed to him by SEIFSA was quite adequate for South Africa. I went into the matter, and it is so much rubbish. I went to ask these people what they meant by that, how they could say a thins like that. They then told me: &#x201C;We do not want to create the opportunity for the Government to interfere further in industries. If the Government were to be given the chance of constituting training councils, we know what kind of training councils they would constitute. We have knowledge of how they constitute these councils. It will simply give the Government a further opportunity to interfere in industries&#x201D;. They say that the devil one knows is better than the devil one does not know. Now the hon. the Minister has the political na&#x00EF;vete to come and dish up to us here what certain industries in South Africa say that is quite right, and that the whole world is wrong. Now what they are really saying, is: &#x201C;We do not give the government a further opportunity to interfere further in our industrial matters. If we give the Minister the opportunities of appointing councils, we know what kind of councils the Government will constitute.&#x201D; That is another point. The hon. the Minister put it to us in this way: &#x201C;If this is done now it will cause a new labour shortage for us, for just think of all the hundreds of councils which will have to be established. Each one of them will require more and more people.&#x201D; Sir, the hon. the Minister does not know what is involved here. The whole British Scheme, for example, is controlled by 15 councils. I do not think that there is one of them that has more than 20 members. Thus, 300 people are involved. They are responsible for the training of more than 20 million workers. When the hon. Minister said that this scheme had cost the British R100 million per year. Let us now get our standards right. This scheme as such is costing the British relatively little, for all the people serving on those councils, are doing so on a part-time basis; and they are not receiving any compensation for it. But when one speaks to the British Government, they will tell you: &#x201C;Our contribution to industrial training is R100 million per year&#x201D;, and they are proud of it. Now I want to put a question to the hon. the Minister once again. Let me say at once that we know the Minister. He does not reply to the questions put to him by this side. He always circumvents them, or he ignores them, or he says that we shall deal with them at a subsequent opportunity. However, if the questions are a little difficult, he ignores them altogether. I am now asking the Minister: &#x201C;What contribution is our South African Government making to industrial training?&#x201D; The Minister must not come and tell me now about trade schools, etc., for this is controlled by the Minister of National Education. It has nothing to do with him now. I want to know what contribution he and his department is making to industrial training in this country. If he can tell me that they are making a contribution like that the British Government is making, namely RI00 million, we will clap him on the shoulder, for then we will know that he is doing his work.</p>

<p>In a further aspect we think that this legislation is completely inadequate. The hon. the Minister now wants to introduce a system whereby certain levies can be made on employers. The emphasis in this kind of legislation must not fall on levies only, but on the way in which people are encouraged. The hon. <span class="col_1707-1708" refersTo="page_0868"/>member for Vanderbijlpark quoted the other day what I had said, and it was quite correct. I adhere to that. I said that, in this kind of legislation, there should be the minimum of compulsion and the maximum encouragement. Throughout the world it is universally accepted that this is true. Let the Minister impose a levy on employers. That we fully accept. Immediately after the expert from SEIFSA, whom the Minister sent overseas, returned, he said: &#x201C;As far as SEIFSA is concerned, we are not only going to impose a levy, they are also going to make payments to the people doing the training.&#x201D; He is of course quite correct. That is how it should be done. We would have liked to have seen the Minister making provision for that in this legislation, but he is not doing so.</p>

<p>I think that there is one further respect where this Bill is completely inadequate. According to what the hon. the Minister told us, there are approximately a hundred industrial councils in South Africa. Just think of that! Each one of these industrial councils is now going to begin with training. Each one is going to have its own standards. Each one will lay down its own norms. If that were to happen, we would have a strange situation. There would then be over a hundred bodies and each one will be engaged in training. Each one will lay down its own standard. Surely this will result in a tremendous confusion. We will be establishing a kind of economic tower of Babel. It is very clear that we need some or other kind of National advisory body. Someone must co-ordinate these matters. Someone must undertake the advance planning. Someone must, after all, ensure that duplication of the training of the various groups does not take place. We think that a co-ordinating is absolutely essential, a body which can cover this entire matter, otherwise we will have a hundred different standards and each one will go his own way. But the hon. the Minister is stubborn. He does not want to know anything about that. All he is doing here is to introduce a system of fragmentization. For the co-ordination, which is so essential, he does not want to make provision. Sir, since we have a hundred different councils which are each going to collect funds from industrialists, friction will arise. Some of our employers will say that the levies are too high. Others will find fault with the way in which the money is being utilized and spent. Who is going to settle all these disputes which could arise in this way? Are he and his Department going to do so? Is that the approach of the hon. the Minister? My experience of these matters is that one should establish somebody or other, with quasi-legal or juristic powers, in order to indicate how such differences can be dealt with, but once again the hon. the Minister does not want to accept our advice.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of finance. We have a hundred councils, and all of them are going to collect large amounts as a result of the levies which are going to be imposed. We are not at all satisfied that there is going to be proper control over the application of this money. It is true that the Minister has in clause 2 provided that certain persons can be appointed in consultation with these councils, but is it going to remain at that? How are these people going to report? Will reports ever be submitted to this House in regard to how much money has been collected, and what is being done with that money? I think that millions of rands will be collected in this way. I think that the machinery created by the Minister in this Bill for this purpose is once again completely inadequate.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to take this matter any further. I just want to say that the Minister here had an excellent opportunity of really giving South Africa a big push forward, as far as these matters are concerned, but his approach here is now so colourless and so unrealistic, and so economically verkramp, that one really cannot believe that this is the Government which must lead us into a new technological era. I will not vote against this legislation, because we support the training of our people. In that respect we will support this Bill, but we are really doing so with great reluctance. As I said here, there was now an excellent opportunity for the hon. the Minister, but he availed himself of it in such a colourless way that it really makes one feel that he does not have the foggiest idea of the actual problems facing us.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it does not surprise me that the Opposition is announcing that it will support this measure, for it would have been very strange if the Opposition had, after this discussion of a manpower shortage, lasting many months, had voted here to-day against a training measure which in fact envisages the improved training of manpower. What one found striking in the criticism of the Opposition was on the one hand their blissful ignorance of what is really happening in South Africa in regard to the training of manpower. They are blissfully ignorant of what the numerous industrial councils are doing on a large scale to train people. Apparently they do not know about the various schemes which are already in operation. Apparently they do not know about all the things the State is doing. Now I am being asked in a naive way what the Department of Labour is doing. They do not want to know what other Departments are doing. I can call it nothing else but a very naive question, for the training of apprentices is taking place in this country at our apprenticeship schools which fall under the Department of Education. This should at least by this time be common knowledge to any member of this House. It makes no difference whether the Department of Labour is undertaking the training or whether the Department of Education is doing so. What counts is that the State is doing something about it. Wien we come to what the State is doing, this Government can testify to a very great <span class="col_1709-1710" refersTo="page_0869"/>achievement. The achievements can be measured against the number of apprentices who are being trained to-day in comparison with the figure often or 20 years ago. It can be measured against the millions of additional rands which are being spent to-day on the training of apprentices and technicians as compared to a decade ago for example. Perhaps the United Party is not quite as ignorant as they appear to be from this silence they are maintaining. I think the major problem is that they deliberately do not want to recognize these facts. They prefer to conjure up the manpower shortages which have arisen as a result of our tremendous national development as a crisis. For after all this is the favourite term of the hon. member for Hillbrow: "We are now undergoing a crisis.&#x201D; That crisis story has only one objective, and it is a political one. It is a political objective in the blissful hope that it can force the Government to depart from its traditional labour pattern. Now we are also getting these references to non-Whites. The hon. member for Musgrave was very concerned because all workers will not be included. I want to tell him and the hon. member for Hillbrow that they need not be concerned about that. All that was needed was to have read this Bill, as well as the memorandum published with it. Apparently these two hon. members did not see their way dear to reading it, for if they had read the Bill and the explanatory memorandum they would have found that the new section 8 (1) (d) provides that these industrial council agreements in terms of which training can take place can be extended to Bantu workers. This is stated very clearly in the memorandum, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In terms of the proposed additional paragraph an agreement relating to a training scheme, may not be declared binding in an additional area or in respect of another industry, unless it is also declared binding on non-parties in that area.</block>

<p>Then it states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Section 48 (3) (a) of the Act provides that an industrial council agreement can be declared binding in respect of Bantu in the area.</block>

<p>In other words, this measure before us can also be extended to Bantu.</p>

<p>Here it is, as clear as daylight in the Bill. Why does the hon. member not read the Bill and the memorandum? Do I also have to come and give the hon. member lessons? One could at least expect him to have taken the trouble to read the memorandum Which has been lying on the Table for weeks. Then we get the other ridiculous question as to whether we do not want to train non-Whites now. This not something we need blench at. I keep on saying that we are training non-Whites and that we have trained more non-Whites than have ever been trained before. This is being done, but it is not being done in the pell-mell way in which the United Party wants to do it. It is not being done by means of an uncontrolled absorption of non-Whites into our traditional White avenues of employment. It is not being done by opening up the sluice gates. It is being done in a restrained manner. It is being done in the way which has also been discussed in this House, i.e. that Bantu will be trained in their own homelands to do skilled work in order to serve their own people there. Similarly Coloureds are being trained to do more and more work in these developing Coloured areas. But now I have to hear from the hon. member for Musgrave and also from the hon. member for Hillbrow that we have a &#x201C;narrow vision&#x201D; in regard to this matter. This measure is supposedly, in the words of the hon. member for Musgrave, &#x201C;inadequate&#x201D; and in the words of the hon. member for Yeoville &#x201C;ontoereikend&#x201D;. What is the background to this outcry against us? We are being crystal clear, straightforward and honest in regard to our objectives by saying that we as a Government are prepared to supply training facilities for the non-Whites. I have just referred to the Bantu. But we do not find the same honest candidness on the part of the United Party. With them one finds a continual chopping and changing in this regard. Here one finds a continual chopping and changing in order to disguise their actual objective in regard to non-White training. We are strengthened in this conclusion by the statement recently made here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. After all these years he stated very openly for the first time in this House that the United Party will abolish work reservation. I am very grateful to him for having, for the first time now, had a very clear statement from the United Party.</p>

<p>Section 77 deals with nothing else but work reservation. It is of no avail skipping about this point either. Section 77 deals with the machinery of work reservation, and if one were to repeal that section, one would be repealing the entire foundation of work reservation and the entire pedestal on which our White protection policy in South Africa is based. That is why we have been strengthened in our conclusion by the recent statement of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the United Party, with the row which it is now kicking up here about this training, is not being honest and open with us, the workers or the country as far as this matter is concerned. With them it is in fact an obsession that they want non-Whites trained in our skilled avenues of employment in an unrestrained manner. Let me say this to the United Party: By adopting that standpoint, regardless <span class="col_1711-1712" refersTo="page_0870"/>of whether it is camouflaged or not, they testify to the fact that they really have no understanding of our labour situation in South Africa, for if non-Whites were to be trained for skilled work in White areas, in an unrestrained manner, we are going to have nothing else but chaos in this country.</p>

<p>It is being done in a restrained manner. If the hon. member wants to attack anybody, he need not attack only the Minister of Labour. He may as well attack me as well for I have granted exemptions to non-Whites to do exempted work. If the hon. member wants to attack someone he may as well attack me as well. I am saying this to him now without beating about the bush, but it is being done in a restrained manner. [Interjections.] If Whites are not available, and if the White trade unions have been consulted in this regard, then those people are taken into consideration and that exemption is granted. The United Party is coming forward here with its manpower cry, which is clearly political. If it were to be carried through we would have chaos in this country, but we would also in fact have a decrease in the productivity of our manpower, for if the White workers in this country begin to have fears about their security, one is no longer going to obtain the productivity from them which we are obtaining to-day. So we find the United Party resorting to all kinds of trivial arguments in this House. Because they did not have the courage to say precisely what they wanted, we find here a trivial argument such as that of the hon. member for Musgrave, who started off here with the story of how long the first sentence in one of these clauses was. He had so much time that he was able to count the words! He did not have time to read the memorandum, but he did have time to count how many words that sentence comprised. Now I am being told that this clause is too long. This is a complicated measure. It is not a cribbed measure, as is that of the hon. member for Hillbrow. He got hold of the British Act and in parrot fashion copied it out in short sentences. This is a measure which is rooted in South Africa&#x2019;s circumstances and one which was drafted after consideration. It was drafted after thorough consideration. Its purpose is not only to make provision for apprentices. This measure is not simply going to encourage apprenticeship training, as the hon. member said. For example, we already have the development in the engineering industry at present, that has already worked out its training scheme. It does not make provision for apprentices only, but also for technicians in the engineering industry. That is precisely what this measure is intended for. Sir, the measure here before the House takes into account South African circumstances. There has been no imitation or cribbing as far as this measure is concerned. It was drafted after thorough consideration. The National Apprenticeship Board, on which the leaders of our industry, eminent employers in the trade unions, discussed all the pros and cons of this matter. It is true that SEIFSA sent their representative overseas. To-day he is being attacked by the hon. member for Hillbrow because he is no longer buttering up to that member. Now that representative of SEIFSA, one of the most important federations in our country, is being attacked. That representative was specially sent overseas. He studied the matter and returned with his report. He is not the only man who has knowledge of the British system. On that National Apprentice Board there are experts on this matter. They discussed this matter. When this Federation had finished discussing it, they said that they regarded this measure as being one of inestimable value for South Africa&#x2019;s conditions. But it is not only SEIFSA that said this; other important federations said the same thing. The Federation of Building Industries, one of the largest federations in the country, said in its annual report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federation welcomes the recent announcement.</block>

<p>That is, namely, the announcement that this measure was going to be introduced. They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the Federation sees it, the announcement implies that the manpower Training Bill will be shelved.</block>

<p>This is that hon. member&#x2019;s imitation business.</p>

<block name="quote">This approach has the unqualified support of the Federation.</block>

<p>It does not seem to me as if they are weeping over the &#x201C;shelving&#x201D; of that imitation Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member would do well to read it again. Perhaps we can argue about this in a future debate.</p>

<p>Then I want to mention to the hon. member still another important federation. The South African Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors writes as follows in their comment on the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors hereby wishes to state that it is in agreement with the proposed Bill &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is now the Bill before the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and that the said Bill conforms to and supports the views of the Federation on the <span class="col_1713-1714" refersTo="page_0871"/>question of training of our available manpower.</block>

<p>These are responsible bodies. These are not a lot of political agents writing these things. They are not people who state their case with ulterior motives, they are experts in regard to the matter. But now one has all kinds of trivial arguments, such as that of the hon. member for Salt River, for example, who is opposed to the fact that the industrial councils have Jo undertake the training. He finds that a terrible thing. Surely they are not training institutions, he says. But who is better able to judge the requirements of a specific industry than the industrial council in question? Surely these are the people who have most knowledge of the needs of artisans in the various directions. This is completely in line with the special committee of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Council which was established in order to discuss this question of manpower training. We also realize that as much as is practicable must be done. But in addition we realize that we, in order to have this succeed, must have the cooperation of private initiative in order to achieve what this measure envisages. But not only do we need that co-operation; we also want to give those industrial councils that take the initiative to supply training schemes the statutory power. We must make their schemes enforceable. We must also make it possible for them, just as in the case of any other wage agreement measure, which is contravened, to take the offenders to court and to compel them to comply with that agreement. That is what this measure envisages. This measure does in fact contain that machinery to enable the industrial councils to supply the training, but it is now endowing those industrial councils with the statutory power to make these training schemes enforceable on those employers who in the past simply lived on those people who had been trained by the willing employers.</p>

<p>This does not mean that we will not give proper attention to the training of non-Whites. We will train them, but subject to the restrictions to which I have referred, which means that it will be for the Bantu in their own areas, and that it will not take place at the expense of the Whites in their avenues of employment. That is why it is necessary for this measure to be placed on the Statute Book without delay, for in this measure we have the assurance that training possibilities are being established without any disturbance of labour relations. In this measure we have the assurance that it will be possible to supplement our manpower without disrupting our labour. We have in this measure the assurance that we will obtain the co-operation from our industrial magnates and that we on the part of the Government are going to strengthen their hands in the execution of this beneficial work. For that one does not need such a comprehensive and clumsy scheme as the one the hon. member for Hill-brow wanted to import for us from England. It is definitely not necessary, for for that we would in this time of a manpower shortage have had to find extra manpower; from where I do not know.</p>

<p>I am concluding by saying that this measure does not testify to so-called &#x201C;narrow vision&#x201D; of which I was accused. On the contrary, this measure testifies to a correct &#x201C;South African vision&#x201D;, if hon. members want to use the word &#x201C;vision&#x201D;. It testifies to a &#x201C;South African vision&#x201D;, because it takes into account the realities and the tradition of South Africa and because it has the humanity in it to afford the non-Whites opportunities of training, but not at the expense of the survival of the Whites and labour relations in this country. That is the basic difference between us and the United Party. That is what it is all about. That is why I am concluding by saying that this measure, which envisages training our workers in an orderly fashion in future is in a manner which is going to give encouragment, but is also going to have the added value that the training schemes can be enforceable, will ensure true progress for South Africa and will help retain our most precious possession, our industrial peace in this country.</p>

<heading>JUDGES&#x2019; REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Judges&#x2019; Remuneration and Pensions Act, 1959, is, as hon. members know, divided into three chapters. Chapter I deals with judges&#x2019; remuneration and pensions; Chapter II deals with judges&#x2019; widows&#x2019; pensions; whereas Chapter III contains certain general provisions. The Bill now before this House, contains amendments which relate to each of those chapters, but the amendments which relate to Chapter II are the ones which are of particular importance.</p>

<p>Clause 1 of the Bill relates to Chapter I of the Act, i.e. the remuneration and pensions of judges. Clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 relate to Chapter II, i.e. the pensions of widows of judges; whereas clause 8 relates to Chapter III, i.e. the general provisions of the Act. In fact, clause 1 of the Bill merely contains a consequential amendment arising from the provisions of section 19 (2) of the South West Africa Affairs Act, 1969. As hon. members know, in the application of any law in force in the territory of South West Africa in so far as that relates to any scheduled matter referred to in that Act, any reference to the Revenue Fund of the territory is construed as a reference to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, i.e. the Revenue Fund of the Republic. In terms of <span class="col_1715-1716" refersTo="page_0872"/>that Act the administration of justice is a scheduled matter. Consequently the salaries and pensions of judges of the South West Africa Division of the Supreme Court have been paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund since the coming into operation of the South West Africa Affairs Act, 1969, i.e. 1st April, 1969.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, the Judges&#x2019; Remuneration and Pensions Act was amended in 1968 to make provision for an increase of the non-taxable allowances and pensions payable to judges. Now the position is that the last increase in the contributions by judges in respect of widows&#x2019; pensions and the pensions payable to the widows of judges, was made on 1st July, 1965. At that time provision was made for a 50 per cent increase in the benefits and contributions due. Therefore, if one has regard to the decreasing tendency of the value of money, it is obvious that the time has arrived for reconsidering this aspect. The judges of the various divisions of the Supreme Court are unanimously in favour of increasing the contributions by judges in respect of widows&#x2019; pensions and the pensions payable to the widows of judges by 50 per cent. Consequently clauses 3 to 5, inclusive, of the Bill make provision for the increase of the contributions payable by a judge to the Consolidated Revenue Fund from R12 to R18 per month. Clause 6 increases the maximum amount a judge is allowed to contribute by 50 per cent from R2,880 to R4.320. In this regard I should like to mention in passing that the judges were prepared to make additional monthly contributions in respect of expired periods of service in order to make up the maximum contributions payable. However, in the case of judges there is no pension fund which has to be kept solvent actuarially or otherwise, and when the amount paid in by a judge has been exhausted by the pension granted, the pension thereafter has to be defrayed from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in any event. Consequently it was decided not to require of judges to make payments in respect of expired periods of service.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a) of clause 7 of the Bill deals with the pensions payable to the widow of a judge who had pensionable service. Here a corresponding increase of 50 per cent is being effected, which consequently increases the maximum amount payable to the widow from R1,800 to R2,700 per annum. Paragraph (b) of clause 7 makes provision for the deletion of section 13 (3) of the principal Act. That section provides that a pension due to a widow shall cease to be payable when she remarries. Now, Sir, hon. members will recall that section 13 of the Parliamentary Service Pensions Act, 1951, contained an identical provision. However, that section was repealed in 1962 by section 6 of the Pension Laws Amendment Act, 1962, and a similar provision was not reenacted when the Parliamentary Service and Administrators&#x2019; Pensions Act, 1965, which repealed the 1951 Act, was placed on the Statute Book. In this respect, therefore, the judges&#x2019; widows who remarry are being placed on an equal footing with the widows of members of the Senate and the House of Assembly. Clause 7 (2) regulates the position in connection with widows in receipt of pensions or persons who become widows of judges who retired prior to the coming into operation of the Amendment Act. In this regard the principle of the 1965 amendment to the Judges&#x2019; Salaries and Pensions Act is being retained.</p>

<p>As regards paragraph (a) of clause 2 of the Bill (in the Afrikaans version it is paragraph (b)), I need hardly say anything. This House is aware of the fact that last year we made history in the field of law when the hon. Justice Leonora van den Heever became the first female judge in our country. This necessitates an adjustment being made in the Judges&#x2019; Remuneration and Pensions Act; otherwise a female judge has to pay widows&#x2019; pension in respect of her own &#x201C;widow&#x201D;. Therefore, by means of this clause, we are keeping abreast of the latest development in our administration of justice. In terms of clause 9 all contributions already made by Justice Van den Heever are to be repaid to her.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a) of clause 8 merely contains a consequential amendment arising from the deletion of certain provisions by paragraph (b) of that clause. The subsections referred to in paragraph (b) of clause 8, relate to the payment of the salary, allowance or pension of a judge who has served in South West Africa, and these are being deleted in the light of the provisions of the South West Africa Affairs Act. 1969. In the final clause provision is being made for the coming into operation of the Act on a date fixed by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i>. In order to eliminate administrative problems, the aim is that the Act should come into operation at the beginning of a month.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House give this Bill our wholehearted support. I think one must remember at this stage what a tremendous financial sacrifice Judges make when they take appointments to the Bench from the Bar. They do this for various reasons, but mostly because it is their duty. I say mostly, because Judges are appointed when they are very much younger to-day, than they were appointed in the days gone by. It is therefore more a duty than security. They deserve security for themselves and their widows and the demands made upon them and the responsibilities they have to bear, I think, must make us all appreciate and support any possible benefits that can be given in the way of some security. Indeed, one wonders, while they are alive, whether more consideration should perhaps not be given by the Government to the salaries they are receiving having regard to the responsibilities which they carry. I hope the hon. the Minister will indicate whether any thoughts in this regard are being considered by the Government.</p>

<p><span class="col_1717-1718" refersTo="page_0873"/>This Bill improves the position for the widows of Judges. The provision that if they marry they do not lose their pension, is a very good one. So we are very pleased that in fact the old Bill was withdrawn and this Bill introduced in order that that might be provided for more easily. As the hon. the Minister has pointed out, it removes the anomaly that a female Judge should contribute to the Widows&#x2019; Fund as a result of the appointment of &#x2014;I do not know whether it has been decided whether a female Judge should be called &#x201C;Her Ladyship or Her Lordship&#x201D;&#x2014; Miss Justice Leo van den Heever. The only aspect of this Bill which gives us cause for concern, is what is not in it.</p>

<p>However, as Mr. Speaker has just pointed out, that is not under discussion. The Bill provides that widows of Judges shall in future receive a much higher pension and quite rightly so. The reason why this is done is that, having regard to the cost of living to-day, they cannot live properly on the pension as it is now. I asked the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions a question the other day, namely how many Judges&#x2019; widows are there at present. There are 17 only. It is a pity that they cannot be included under this Bill. I know that one of them receives only R50 per month. This woman has a standard to keep up. Her pension is only R50 per month. That is R15 more than an old-age pensioner would get who had made no contribution whatsoever to our national life. I think it is a disgrace. I hoped that something would have been done. We on this side of the House cannot do anything about it. Otherwise we would have given notice of an amendment. However, as everyone in the House is aware, only Ministers may amend Bills where extra expenditure is involved.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I merely wish to point out why it is that we are not going to move any amendment to this Bill. We will not move an amendment because it is not in our power to do so. As I have said, only Ministers may move an amendment which will entail expenditure by the State not envisaged by the Bill. I do not believe that the Judges Widows&#x2019; Fund is actuarially calculated. Will the hon. the Minister not give consideration to these 17 &#x201C;bestaande weduwees&#x201D; who are in this difficulty. He is the only one who can do it. We cannot do it from this side of the House. I would say that the cost of living <i>a fortiori</i> applies to the existing widows more than it does to the future widows. Subject to this point which I have mentioned and to which we hope the hon. the Minister will give his attention, because only he can do anything about it, we offer not only no objection to this Bill, but our wholehearted support for this Bill. If the hon. the Minister wants all the stages of this Bill at this stage, we would be very happy to support him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Opposition for their support as well as for the friendly offer that this Bill may be taken through all its stages now.</p>

<p>I just want to refer, in brief, to a few matters on which the hon. member for Durban (Point) touched. It is true that Senior Counsel do go to the Bench at a very early age at present. In most cases they do so at a stage when they are not yet completely independent financially. This is something which must be borne in mind. This fact is also mentioned in representations in connection with their emoluments which are being made to me at present. Therefore we bear knowledge of this fact.</p>

<p>As regards the question of the wives of already deceased Judges for whom no provision is being made in this Bill, I just want to say in passing that this always is a very difficult subject. We have a similar position in Parliament. The widows of previous Members of Parliament do not receive the same pension our own wives will receive. The widows of previous Prime Ministers who served in this House, do not receive the same pension either. That is how matters stand. It is a very unfortunate position. Once one starts pushing these things, one cannot say where the line should be drawn. This is the difficulty with which I am faced in this connection. It is <i>infra dig</i>, but if a widow is finding it very difficult to make ends meet, there always is the Committee on Pensions which she may approach. That is so. Unfortunately I cannot give the hon. member for Durban (North) any assurance at this stage that I shall be able to remedy the matter.</p>

All the same, I do feel that I should briefly explain the various clauses in order to make matters easier still.</p>

<p>As far as clause 1 is concerned, it is common knowledge that the Department of Posts is erecting a microwave tower in Johannesburg. It will be possible for the public to visit the tower after its completion, and as an incentive, restaurants, including a revolving restaurant, and other amenities are being erected at a great height in order to afford the public a view over the City of Johannesburg and in order to provide the necessary facilities there. The restaurants and the other amenities offered can serve as an exceptional medium for promoting the image of not only the Post Office, but also of the country.</p>

<p>The catering in the restaurants will be of a high standard and as the Department of Post is neither equipped nor keen to undertake it, the restaurant complex will be made available to private initiative on lease basis. Similar undertakings are envisaged in the other large cities as well.</p>

<p>According to the lessee, the restaurant complex will be unique and will be open during all hours of the day and till after midnight, in other words, the normal eating hours that apply in the case of other restaurants will not be adhered to. This tower should be a great tourist attraction and convenient liquor facilities in the restaurant will contribute towards making a success of this undertaking. It appears that the provisions of the Liquor Act in respect of a restaurant liquor licence, especially in regard to the hours during which liquor may be provided, will hamper the service proposed to be provided in the restaurants. Consequently representations were made by the Postmaster-General to the effect that the lessee of the restaurant complex be exempted from the obligation to take out a restaurant liquor licence. In clause 1 of the Bill provision is therefore being made for the granting of Ministerial authority for the sale of liquor in such a restaurant, subject to such conditions or restrictions as may be imposed by the Minister of Justice, and for exempting the holder of such an authority from the obligation to take out a liquor licence.</p>

<p>As far as clause 2 is concerned, the holder of a restaurant liquor licence in terms of section 75 (2) (e) of the Liquor Act may serve liquor to guests together with their meals only between 12 o&#x2019;clock noon and 2.30 p.m. and 6 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. However, liquor may not be sold after 9 p.m. on a Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday, Ascension Day or the Day of the Covenant by the holder of a restaurant liquor licence. It is well known that licensed restaurants generally maintain a high standard and that most of their clients are prominent persons. Lately, however, restaurants are toeing opened which are intended to be more exclusive in nature and designed to attract foreign tourists in particular. In this regard I may mention that, according to reports, the lay-out of a certain restaurant in Johannesburg cost Ry million. If one bears in mind that the corresponding closing time for a classified hotel in the last group is 12 p.m., it would appear that the closing time of 11.30 p.m. for a restaurant of this nature as far as the sale of liquor is concerned is too early. Instead of extending restaurant hours in general, the Minister is being empowered by clause 2 to authorize, upon application and on the recommendation of the National Liquor Board, the sale of liquor after 11 p.m. until such late hour as he may deem fit. This provision will grant the power to authorize extended hours only in those cases where the nature of the restaurant&#x2019;s business necessitates it.</p>

<p>The amendments in clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill are consequential upon the amendment in clause 1 and propose to extend the requirements in regard to the sale of minimum quantities by wholesalers to any person who sells liquor on the authority of the Commissioner of Police, the Commissioner of Prisons, etc., to sales by a wholesaler to any person who sells liquor by authority to a restaurant in a building under the control of the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>As far as clause 5 is concerned, the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, provides for the establishment of tribal, communal, regional and territorial authorities. As hon. members know, the boundaries of the respective territorial authorities are planned on a tribal basis within the specific ethnic context. In the determination of magisterial or Bantu Commissioner&#x2019;s district boundaries tribal or territorial boundaries have not necessarily been taken into account in the past and it happened that Bantu areas which geographically or by virtue of occupation by members of the same ethnic unit or tribe actually from one administrative unit for the purposes of Bantu administration, were sometimes divided between two or more magisterial districts. It happens that in some matters a Bantu has to approach the Bantu Commissioner of his territory, while in other matters he has to approach the magistrate of the district. This just leads to confusion among the Bantu and therefore it is considered necessary to treat the various tribal territories as units not only for administrative purposes and for the purposes of their own forms of government, but also on a district basis. Because tribal territories are not necessarily continuous areas, it is necessary to establish districts which also consist of noncontinuous areas. This is what is envisaged in terms of this clause.</p>

<p>This brings me to clause 6. Section 33 (2) (a) of the Hotels Act, 1965, provides that as from a prescribed date, which shall not be before 31st December, 1968, no person who conducts the business of supplying lodging or any accommodation, with or without meals, which is not registered as an hotel under that Act, shall use the designation or term &#x201C;hotel&#x201D;, <span class="col_1721-1722" refersTo="page_0875"/>&#x201C;motel&#x201D;, and so forth. The date announced in the <i>Government Gazette</i> as the prescribed date on which the prohibition is to take effect, is 1st May, 1970. Furthermore, section 14 (1) (a) of the Hotels Act provides that any person who conducts an accommodation establishment in respect of which an hotel liquor licence and a certificate of classification is held under the Liquor Act, may apply to the Hotel Board for the registration of such establishment as an hotel.</p>

<p>Section 53 (3) of the Liquor Amendment Act, 1963, provides, however, that if no certificate of classification was issued on or before 31st December, 1968, in respect of an accommodation establishment conducted under an hotel liquor licence, the renewal of such licence shall be deemed to have been granted in respect of a wine and malt liquor licence in respect of the premises concerned. But section 53 (3) also authorizes the Minister of Justice to grant an extension of time for classification in any particular case for such period and subject to such condition as he may deem fit. Now it so happens that various establishments failed to qualify for classification in time and were granted extensions of time, which vary from one case to another, in order to enable them to qualify for classification. In some cases the extension periods extend beyond 1st May, 1970&#x2014;the date upon which the prohibition on the use of the designation &#x201C;hotel&#x201D; will take effect. It appears that the establishments concerned are making positive attempts to improve their standards in order to qualify for registration as an hotel, and it is therefore equitable to allow them to continue using the name or designation &#x201C;hotel&#x201D; until a reasonable time after classification in terms of the Liquor Act.</p>

<p>This is envisaged with the amendment in the first paragraph of clause 6. At the Committee Stage I shall move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, in order to make provision for accommodation establishments in the Mount Currie district. These establishments have until the end of 1974 to apply for classification. The period of four months which is prescribed is necessary because the Hotel Board cannot immediately after the classification of an accommodation establishment register such an establishment under the Hotels Act, but must be granted time to examine and consider the application. Section 14 (1) of the Hotels Act, 1965, further provides that any person who conducts an accommodation establishment where liquor is not sold and where it is not intended to sell liquor may also apply to the Hotel Board for the registration of such establishment as an hotel. Until now, some persons conducting establishments of this kind have not shown great interest in having those establishments registered as hotels. Now that a date has in fact been determined after which the designation &#x201C;hotel&#x201D; may no longer be used, there appears to be an increasing measure of interest in improving standards and in applying <b>for</b> registration as an hotel.</p>

<p>However, time is required in order to effect the necessary alterations. I have already pointed out that the renewal of hotel liquor licences in respect of accommodation establishments which are not classified in terms of the Liquor Amendment Act, 1963, is deemed to have been granted in respect of wine and beer licences in respect of the premises concerned. Persons who conduct establishments of this nature may also apply for registration of the establishment concerned as an hotel. In such cases too it may be necessary to grant an extension of time. In order to provide for the various cases which may apply for registration as an hotel, it is deemed necessary to introduce a general amendment in terms of which the prohibition on the use of the name or designation &#x201C;hotel&#x201D; will be further postponed for a certain time. This is done in terms of the second paragraph of this clause.</p>

<p>Clause 7 seeks to empower the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa to make donations in respect of any matter within the territory and elsewhere. The law advisers are of the opinion that the South West Africa Constitution Act does not at present grant the power to make ordinances which authorize donations for purposes outside the territory, or within the territory in respect of matters which have been withdrawn from the authority of the Legislative Assembly. This amendment is being made at the request of the South West African Administration and is being given retrospective effect in order to authorize a donation in connection with an agricultural show which is provided for in an appropriation ordinance of the Legislative Assembly.</p>

<p>My hon. friend puts it very well. Last year the hon. the Deputy Minister in charge of the Bill said that there was nothing contentious in it and he was wrong.

<p>Yes, even the hon. member for Houghton is absent and the hon. member for Durban (Point) is not present either, which indicates again that there is nothing contentious in the provisions relating to hotels and to the liquor laws. He also is quite satisfied that the Bill is quite non-contentious. With regard to the provisions of those clauses dealing with liquor, I must say that after all <span class="col_1723-1724" refersTo="page_0876"/>the talk that we have had here about who is whose &#x201C;bondgenote&#x201D;, it is perhaps pleasing to hon. members of the Herstigte Nasionale Party to find that they may now have liquor sold with their meals when they dine in the Hertzog Tower. Perhaps it is also time that one should be able to have a drink immediately after one&#x2019;s meal so that one can have some liqueur, as is provided for under those circumstances under special authority.</p>

<p>But, Sir, apart from those provisions the only other provision which might cause some discussion and on which we would like some more information is contained in clause 5. Clause 5 provides that the hon. the Minister, when he defines the boundaries of the magisterial districts can now make provision that they may consist of various non-contiguous areas. The hon. the Minister has explained that this is because there are Bantu areas where a Bantu Commissioner is appointed who performs the same functions but who does this in respect of the Bantu areas. In the Transkei there is a sort of working agreement about this. The only occasion when any difficulty might arise, is where an offence is committed by, say, a White man in the Bantu area. Does he not then come within the jurisdiction of the Bantu Commissioner? We see that in the Transkei Bantu magistrates are being appointed, and indeed not only in the Transkei, but also in Durban; in the magisterial district of Umlazi there is a Bantu Commissioner who I performs the functions of a magistrate where the law contravened requires that he act as a magistrate and not as a Bantu Commissioner. We would like to know just what is involved, here. Who would then try a White man who has committed an offence in an area falling within the jurisdiction of a Bantu Commissioner. Because the jurisdiction of a magistrate is now being removed in respect of that Bantu area. Sir, the other point which the hon: the Minister could clear up is this: Where else besides the Transkei does he anticipate difficulties of this kind arising.</p>

<p>Sir, clause 7, the last clause of the Bill, deals i with the South West African Constitution, which is being amended again. It is perhaps the most amended Constitution after our own. The amendment is obviously a necessary one. There is nothing in the Bill to which we offer, any objection but we would like some more clarification about clause 5.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, by way of an aside, I want to point out that the hon. the Deputy Leader of the Hertzog Pary is not present. It is a great pity, because he has the opportunity here to support a very positive measure, a measure which seeks to encourage our expanding tourist trade, and which makes provision for longer restaurant hours, etc &#x2026; We noticed in the January edition of <i>New Nation</i> that the hon. the Deputy Leader of the Herstigte National Party is a connoisseur of food and drink. I say it is a pity that he is hot present to avail himself of this opportunity. Sir, I shall leave that matter now, and in reply to the hon. member for Durban (North), who has just resumed his seat, I want to point out that the provisions of Act No. 38 of 1927 are very clear in regard to this point. Section 9 of the Act concerned reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Bantu Affairs Commissioner may hold a court in respect of any offence committed by a Bantu and in respect of the area for which a Bantu Affairs Commissioner has been appointed, he and a court held by him shall for the purposes of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act and the Criminal Procedure Act, be deemed to be a magistrate and a magistrate&#x2019;s court, respectively, in connection with any proceedings relating to any such offence.</block>

<p>The words &#x201C;magistraat&#x201D; and &#x201C;magistraatshof&#x201D; in the Afrikaans version should of course, read &#x201C;landdros&#x201D; and &#x201C;landdroshof&#x201D;, respectively. In other words, this answers his question in regard to areas outside the Transkei. This will apply only in respect of an offence committed by a Bantu. As far as the Transkei itself is concerned, he supplied his own answer. Therefore, looking at the matter as a whole, Sir, we have no further reason to reply to any of the points which the Opposition raised, and for a change we are grateful to them.</p>

There are powers under the Bantu Administration Act of 1927 which make provision for a proclamation by which special courts may be established. This clause was inserted at the request of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and he assures me that provision exists under the 1927 Act for the appointment of a White magistrate to conduct the administration of justice in a Bantu area in a case in which a White person is involved.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as the subject of this Bill is concerned, the position is that prior to 1952 there was no statutory provision for the removal of tissues from the bodies of dead or living persons for therapeutic or scientific purposes. As a result of representations made by various bodies, especially the South African National Council: for the Blind, for statutory permission to use certain human tissues for therapeutic <span class="col_1725-1726" refersTo="page_0877"/>purposes, the Post-Mortem Examinations and Removal of Human Tissues Act was passed in 1952. The principal object of this Act is, subject to the savings provided in the Act, to legalize the removal of tissues from the bodies of dead or living persons and the preservation and use of such tissues for therapeutic or scientific purposes.</p>

<p>As a result of the most dramatic as well as possibly the most important development that has ever taken place in medical science, the existing legislation has become inadequate for meeting present-day needs. I am referring here to developments in the sphere of tissue transplantation, and in particular to heart transplantation, a sphere in which South Africa has led the world. The news that South African doctors had performed the first heart transplant, was flashed in messages to all parts of the world. This achievement by the South African heart-transplant team was regarded as being so important that for a considerable time it was given priority in world news.</p>

<p>In the course of time the South African success was followed by similar operations in America and subsequently in several other countries as well. In order to meet the manifold legal as well as practical problems which cropped up, the Americans drafted legislation which applies in respect of all states. We in South Africa have had the opportunity to study this legislation. With due regard to every relative factor, the legislation which is before the House at the moment and which, incidentally, is amongst the most modern of its kind in the world, was drafted. In this regard, Mr. Speaker, I should like to say that we are willing to make available particulars of this legislation to any country in the world which approaches us in this connection. I may add that inquiries are already being made from several quarters.</p>

<p>The Bill makes statutory provision in respect of the donation or transplantation of tissue, criminal and civil liability in respect of acts performed in good faith, trading in human tissue, the prevention of undesirable publicity in the lay Press, as well as savings in regard to the transplantation of certain organs which may have far-reaching legal, moral and ethical implications.</p>

<p>If it is borne in mind that in recent years no medical event has brought about as much disputability as did the developments to which I referred, the necessity of paying attention to the legal aspects thereof is obvious. The task of drafting suitable legislation was, in the first place, referred to the Advisory Council of the Department of Health. This council subsequently came up with draft legislation based on existing needs. This draft legislation was referred to the Medical Council, the Medical Association and the Provincial Administrations, and all of them, supported the proposals in broad principle.</p>

<p>This Bill was introduced in Parliament last year and, before the Second Reading thereof it was referred to a select committee of this House. The committee had at its disposal probably some of the best medical brains in the world&#x2014;nothing less than those of the heart transplant team of the University of Cape Town which performed the first heart transplant, as well as those of the transplant team of the University of Stellenbosch, which has also achieved major success in regard to very important tissue transplantation. In addition, the advice of the Medical Council and others of repute in the sphere of medicine was available to them. Without fear of contradiction it may be said that the Committee had at its disposal the best possible advice.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal in general with the broad principles contained in the Bill. In the first place, the Bill confines itself to the question of the donation of a dead body and tissue from such body for therapeutic, dental or scientific purposes. Such a donation can be made by the person concerned during his lifetime, or after his death by a spouse or a close relative, or by a district surgeon under special circumstances, i.e. when no relative of the deceased person can be traced and two medical practitioners have stated in writing that such tissue is urgently required for saving the life of another person. Provision has also been made in terms of which persons wishing to donate tissue, may ensure that this is in fact done by wearing an identity tag issued by an authorized institution. In cases where this is done, such persons shall, in terms of the Bill, be deemed to be donors of the tissue specified on the identity tag. This provision has been included at the request of, <i>inter alia</i>, the National Council for the Blind.</p>

<p>Provision has also been made in clause 2 for the donation of the entire body to have preference in the event of contradictory instructions having been given by the donor. Clause .3 contains two very important principles. Firstly, it prohibits the transplantation of gonads obtained from the dead body of any person into the body of another person, without the prior consent of the Minister having been obtained. This applies to all cases where it may result in procreation. The necessity for the care taken in this respect is obvious; consequently it is hardly necessary for me to go into the legal, moral and ethical implications thereof.</p>

<p>Secondly, clause 3 relates to the highly contentious question of the moment of death, something for which specific provision has not been made in the Bill. The Select Committee, after careful consideration of every aspect of the matter, arrived at the conclusion that this was a matter which should be left to the medical practitioners concerned. The Bill contains the important proviso that before any tissue may be removed from a dead body for use in a living person, the death of the person concerned has to be established hy two medical practitioners, one of whom shall have been practising as a medical practitioner for at least five years, What is more, these two medical practitioners may not be members of the transplant team.-However, in the Case of the removal of eye tissue, this, may be done if the <span class="col_1727-1728" refersTo="page_0878"/>usual death certificate has already been issued. This exception was incorporated at the request of the ophthalmologists, since eye tissue which has not been removed within four hours, but preferably within two hours, after the death of the donor, is unsuitable for transplantation purposes.</p>

<p>The Bill also authorizes post-mortem examinations where they are necessary for establishing the cause of death, or for a particular scientific purpose. Provision for giving authorization to medical practitioners and dentists for removing tissues from the bodies of deceased persons, has been made in clause 5. Whereas the procedure in this respect is, generally speaking, similar to that contained in existing legislation, unnecessary cumbersomeness has been eliminated. But every necessary saving has, however, been retained. The savings prohibiting improper removal have been strengthened further by the requirements of clause 6, which specifies the particulars with which the Secretary for Health is to be furnished in regard to authorizations for the removal of tissues.</p>

<p>As is the case in clause 3, clause 5 also contains a concession in regard to authorization for the removal of eye tissue.</p>

<p>The Bill, Mr. Speaker, contains two very important principles concerning the removal and use of tissues taken from the bodies of living persons. Firstly, it prohibits the use of any gonad, removed from the body of a living person, in the body of another living person, without the prior consent of the Minister having been obtained. The dangers and legal implications involved in uncontrolled transplantations of gonads, are innumerable and need hardly be specified. The related clause, i.e. clause 7, specifically excludes the transplantation of gonads from one spouse to the other, and quite rightly too, since no moral, ethical and legal dangers are involved in such transplants. This. I may add, includes artificial insemination by the spouse. However, the Bill does, for instance, prohibit artificial insemination by the donor.</p>

<p>The second important principle contained in clause 7, is the prohibition on the removal of tissues for transplantation purposes from the bodies of minors or mentally disordered or retarded persons. Matters such as the legal right to donated tissue, criminal and civil liability in respect of acts performed in good faith and the prohibition of the sale of human tissue, are covered adequately by the Bill, i.e. in clauses 8, 9 and 10.</p>

<p>The last of the important principles contained in the Bill, is the provision in clause 14, in terms of which the publication of the names of donors and recipients is prohibited unless prior consent has been obtained from the persons concerned. In this regard I may mention that the Committee gave very careful consideration to every aspect of this matter before arriving at a decision. The Committee was unanimous in their view that the right of the persons concerned to protect their identity, had to be respected, and I am in full agreement with this, Sir.</p>

<p>These, Mr. Speaker, are the main principles contained in this Bill, and I recommend without any hesitation that this measure be adopted as a matter of urgent public importance. In fact, the Government also realizes how urgent this measure is. Hence the priority which has been given to it during this short session, for I am convinced that we&#x2014;the Government as well as this House&#x2014;do not want to stand in the way of our medical practitioners, who can be compared with the best in the whole world, in alleviating suffering or prolonging lives or bringing joy as far as it is scientifically possible. But I think I should also add here that in regard to all the achievements by our scientists and the great achievements that still lie ahead, all of us, and I believe our scientists as well, are very deeply aware of the fact that these successes are only possible by the grace of God.</p>

<p>Finally I want to express my thanks to the Committee, the Select Committee of this House and members on both sides of the House under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Prinshof, Adv. Kruger, for the very thorough consideration they gave to this whole matter last year. They had a short time to do the work, and I think they themselves realized the extreme importance of this matter. Hence we have a situation where the Bill before us at the moment, was unanimously recommended by the members of that Select Committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I want to commence by adding my appreciation of the chairmanship by the hon. member for Prinshof of this Select Committee. I want to add my appreciation to that of the Minister. He had a very short period available and yet the Committee, under his guidance, managed to complete its work. This is a necessary Bill. The Acts of Parliament which dealt with post-mortems and anatomy in this country were passed before the era of the modern organ transplants and there can be no doubt that organ transplants constitute a health-giving science which will grow. When you consider that one body can provide spare parts for at least 17 different people, one sees how important this science is. There are enough organs for at least 17 different people whose lives can be helped and who in many instances need and will receive prolongation of their lives. This Bill meets all the problems which are to be met legally and scientifically. The one problem it cannot solve is that of the donor, of finding a donor, but that is a subject which can be discussed later. For many years surgeons have occupied themselves with helping dying or deformed people by transplants, by trying to remove one organ from one person to another, or by replacing parts which disfigure by metal plates, or bones from animals. In fact, almost everything conceivable has been used at some time or another in the effort to help the disfigured or injured person, but with only one success. That success <span class="col_1729-1730" refersTo="page_0879"/>is the invention of a metal called vitallium, which is a metal specially prepared and which lies inert in the human body and is not rejected. The most common transplant is, of course, human blood. When properly controlled and managed, it is a transplant which never fails, and under modern conditions it practically never gives rise to any complications. But it should not be forgotten that at the outbreak of World War I we were roughly in the position as regards blood transfusions in which we are to-day in regard to the transplantation of organs. It took many years from the first attempts to transplant blood before it was scientifically arranged and science had the knowledge to be able to say that this blood is suitable and that blood is not suitable, and if you use it it will be rejected, but if you use the other one it will not be rejected. We are in about the same position to-day with human transplants. Blood has the advantage that it is easily collected and it does not seriously affect the donor. It can be stored and it can be transported. All these are practical problems which face those doctors who are attempting to deal with the transplantation of organs. It is thanks to those scientists who carried out the research that we have such success to-day that really blood transfusion is almost taken for granted. But here, more than almost any other organ, it was found that ft was difficult to get donors. Donors were slow in coming forward and it was extremely difficult. There were times, as I personally can remember, when there was no blood available and it was urgently needed.</p>

<p>It took the Second World War to make the public realize the public duty of offering themselves as donors. It was during that war that most of this work was carried out. It saved many a life of both combatants and noncombatants during that war. There were occasional successes before of hetero-transplants, namely transplants from one human onto another. There were occasional temporary successes. There were, for instance, cases of a badly burnt baby from whom it was impossible to take skin for transplanting which was urgently needed to get the wounds to heal on account of there being no skin available. A transplant of skin from the mother to that child would then be performed to temporarily tide the child over a difficult period until an auto transplant could be carried out. Occasional transplants from twins were successful. But there were no other successful transplants before the advent of the present era of tissue matching. I have no doubt that the question of tissue matching will be solved. Nobody can however say when. Until that can be done, the question of the treatment of heart transplants is one which cannot be neglected.</p>

<p>The offer of a heart transplant is not an offer of a normal life. It is at best an extension of some months, or perhaps some years as it improves. to the life which faces the recipient. The recipient alt present is one who has had every possible treatment which the physicians can offer him. It is only after such treatment that it is finally decided that he must be offered a new heart as the only prospect of prolonging his life. It should not be thought that the recipient in a heart transplant comes to a hospital by hazard. The truth of the matter is that, particularly in a large teaching hospital, there are always recipients waiting on a graft. This is because the man Who comes to the hospital is usually under the care of the hospital doctors, on and off, for long periods of even years. Finally, the doctors who have studied this man and who understand his condition decide that the only our available is that of a transplant. Normally he would have had only a few weeks to live without such transplant.</p>

<p>This, therefore, means that the scarcity of donors is of the utmost importance. Many of these people die while waiting on a donor. The donor on the other hand is only found by chance when he or she is admitted to a hospital suffering from a serious brain illness or injury while the remainder of his or her body is still normal. The potential donor is admitted as a sick man and not as a potential donor. The question of a potential donor does not arise in any hospital until such time as the resuscitating teams or the teams in the intensive care unit who accept these people are perfectly satisfied that this man has no prospect of recovery. The decision is only then communicated to the transplant team that such a potential donor is available. Up till that moment the transplant team is probably not even aware that such a person is in the hospital. It is only after the highly qualified, highly trained and highly experienced people in that hospital who are detailed specially, not for transplants but for resuscitation and care of the dangerously ill people, are beginning to despair, that any word whatever will be sent to the transplant team. It is only at that stage that the transplant team will be put in a state of readiness but not necessarily called to the hospital. The resuscitating team consists of experts in resuscitation and in the care of people. They do their work under supervision of experts in the various areas where the injury lies, mostly injuries, damage or illness of the brain. The brain is entirely the deciding factor in death. It is only when the resuscitation team is perfectly satisfied that there has been irrecoverable damage to the brain that steps are taken to hand over the patient. The patient is kept alive by respirators, transfusions and oxygenated blood for a long period before that decision is made. Once those in charge of the resuscitation are satisfied that the patient is irretrievably dead and that his brain can never recover, two ordinary practitioners are called in to state whether or not the patient is alive. These two men will have at their disposal, firstly the team itself. These will give them advice. They will see the machines turned off. They can take as long as they like to make a decision. But they must make that decision and they alone with all the advice available. At that moment the decision is taken to make no more efforts to carry on with means of resuscitation.</p>

<p><span class="col_1731-1732" refersTo="page_0880"/>I stress this, because there is a widespread fear, not only in this country but also in other parts of the world, that donors who might have recovered or who are capable of recovery might be used. It must be remembered that these two practitioners are not there to hand over a viable donor. By viable I do not mean alive donor. &#x201C;Viable&#x201D; means capable of survival or physically able to survive, not alive. That can never take place in the case of the brain. Brain decides death. It is only when they are satisfied that the brain is dead that they will sign the certificates. There is not the slightest danger of donors being used before the brain is irretrievably dead. It is absolutely vital that, that shall have been certified by competent ordinary doctors. The public, lawyers and theologians are all worried about this. Life and death are not moments. The brain may die in a moment but the heart may take up to eight hours under careful treatment before it dies. The limbs will live for about eight hours under treatment, the nails and the hair possibly for longer still. The cornea of the eye can be stored for about 21 days. But there i Will never be a brain transplant because it will have to be a living transplant. And that will never take place.</p>

<p>These are serious matters. The question of life and death is not an instant. The theologians particularly would like, us to be able to say that the soul has departed. But is the heart the home of the soul? Who has seen any soul departed or seen one come back for that matter? That is something which they will have to do without. We can absolutely guarantee that no other institution apart from a teaching hospital or large hospital anywhere will ever attempt transplants. The only exception could perhaps be that of a cornea transplant. No other hospital than a large teaching hospital can possibly undertake a heart transplant, a liver transplant or even a kidney transplant. These are vital organs which need the most careful and knowledgeable care during transplants and thereafter. We must however face the fact that the public must be reassured. That is why I have taken considerable time over this particular point in order to show as far as possible that the safeguards are the same as those in any other doctor&#x2019;s practice. The public have had confidence in doctors, not only in this country, but in the world. They have relied on doctors to make just such decisions as are called for in these instances. There is no real difference between the responsibility carried by a doctor who cares for a patient in the home and finally ascertains that he is dead and signs the certificate, and the responsibility of the doctor deciding in a hospital that a man has died and that he can be used as a donor. How often do! we, particularly in Durban, not have to stop artificial respiration on a person who has drowned. There comes at time when one sees; that the person will recover, or else you say to those who are helping you: &#x201C;It is no good. We have to give up. The man is dead.&#x201D; There is no difference. The responsibility on the doctor is the same. Only in this Bill it says that, for the particular purposes of a transplant, there must be two ordinary practitioners to certify death. One would do. He would be responsible. He knows his responsibility. I hope that with this Bill we shall remove the doubts from the minds of the public and that the faith which they have always had in their doctors will remain justified and will continue.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will permit me, as Chairman of the Select Committee which submitted this Bill to the hon. the Minister, to thank in brief a few people and organizations for the assistance they gave us. Firstly, I should like to convey the thanks, of the Committee to the Secretariat, which, under the guidance of Mr. Van der Westhuizen, arranged everything for us in a very thorough manner. Then I should also like to thank Mr. Marr of the Department of Health for his assistance in regard to the drafting of this Bill. In spite of the fact that at a certain stage I had to make use of his services almost every day and sometimes took up his: time until late in the day, after 4.30 p.m., he was always willing to do the work and acquitted himself of his task in a vigorous manner. In addition, I want to extend the thanks of the Committee to those persons and organizations that assisted us through their particularly illuminating memoranda, as well as to the medical men and members of the Press Union, who gave us the benefit of their particular specialized knowledge. World famous medical men appeared before us, and we appreciate the sacrifice of their precious time. I want to express my personal gratitude and appreciation to the other members of the Committee. The Committee consisted of colleagues from both sides of this House, i.e. medical men, a medical scientist and lawyers. The assistance rendered by the medical men on the Committee was invaluable to us in our work. I want to express the modest hope that we, who are lawyers, also made a contribution.</p>

<p>Very briefly I should just like to motivate a few significant decisions taken by the Committee. I start with clause 14, which deals with publicity in regard to transplants. I want to make it very clear that the Committee proceeded on the premise that we wanted to restrict the Press as little as possible as far as its work was concerned. However, all the witnesses were agreed that there was a sphere of the private life of every person in respect of which he was entitled to its remaining private, unless the person himself preferred it to be otherwise, and that transplant operations were such a sphere. This was also the attitude adopted by the British Medical Council in a memorandum submitted to us. Consequently it was decided to make publicity in regard to such Operations subject to the consent of the person himself.</p>

<p>Then I should like to refer to clause 3 (2), <span class="col_1733-1734" refersTo="page_0881"/>which deals with establishing the moment of death. Having listened to the various opinions, as well as differences of opinion, of the very learned gentlemen, the Committee realized that it was no easy task to define death, nor to pin-point the moment of death. Just as it is virtually impossible to determine the exact moment at which an unborn child receives the impulse of life from the Giver of all good things, so difficult it is to determine the exact moment at which life passes from the human body. The only thing the doctor can do, is to tell the mother of an unborn child at a certain moment, &#x201C;Your child is alive,&#x201D; without determining the precise moment at which life started. In the same way it is possible for doctors to state clearly, &#x201C;The person is dead,&#x201D; without determining the exact moment at which it occurred. The Committee subsequently decided that the condition of death should therefore be left in the hands of two medical practitioners, who are not members of any surgical team, who are involved in such a case. It is important to us that, having heard all the evidence, especially from the medical men of the hospitals where transplants had already taken place, the Committee was quite satisfied that no human tissue was being removed from a person before he had actually died.</p>

<p>According to its modest ability, the Committee also tried to foresee in the Bill possible, future medical breakthroughs. If one bears in mind that man has already placed a man on the moon, I think that the Committee was not presumptuous in adopting such an attitude. I am referring in particular to the possible transplant of ovaries into barren women. In my modest opinion this would imply a greater breakthrough than the one accomplished in respect of heart transplants. This would hold out to thousands of barren women the prospect of cuddling a child of their own. &#x2018;</p>

<p>The Committee accepts that possible amendments will perhaps be effected to the Bill. Actually, nothing is perfect, but we are nevertheless of the opinion that this Bill will satisfy the medical profession. We should like to extend to the hon. the Minister our sincere thanks for affording us the opportunity to serve on such an interesting Committee.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would say that this Bill, amongst other things, gives security to those involved in the great strides made during the past few years in the fields of specialized medicine and surgery, those strides which have led to what is now popularly called transplantation of organ surgery. The progress made is really sensational. We in South Africa must, of course, join in showering great praise and great honour on those surgeons, physicians, technicians, pathologists and immunologists who played such a great part in the behind scenes activities which took place before the sensational heart transplant by Dr. Barnard occurred. These people did not do this work overnight. It took years of preparation, years of diligence and years: of tenacity before they ventued into an unknown world. I must say that the sensation that this original heart transplant caused throughout the world was phenomenal. For South Africans it was a great tribute that, here in Cape Town, this work had been undertaken, and undertaken successfully. But then, we must look further, and say to ourselves: What part did we play? What part did the man in the street play? What did the Government do towards this great surgical venture? I want to say a few filings now about the opportunities that exist for the public and for the Government in this regard, so that those research workers who want to further their work will not be hindered. The Republic has, without doubt, a vast, natural and nation-wide laboratory. This laboratory s doors must be kept open. The only way in which it can be done is by individuals, as they have been doing recently, by the Government, by public bodies and institutions of all kinds putting their hands deep into their pockets and giving towards research work. Let. us take, for instances, the opportunities that exist for studying heart diseases or arterial diseases. There is no country in the world that has these opportunities because here we have three different groups of people. We have the Bantu, the Coloureds and the white people. The opportunity that exists here to study the differences between the Bantu, the Coloured and the white, person are boundless because we know that in the case of the Bantu, coronary thrombosis for instance, is a rare disease and that as he becomes westernized, so it becomes more frequent. We know that the Coloured as far as coronary thrombosis is concerned is nearer to the white man. The tragedy of the story, however, is that 40 per cent of the middle-aged persons in western countries, and that means 40 per cent of our white people here, may die of coronary thrombosis. We have the opportunity here to find out how we can avoid this because of the incidence factors in our different races. If we do not take this opportunity soon, we may find that it will be too late to do it in 20 or 30 years&#x2019; time. Already we know that conditions that existed concerning the Bantu 20 years ago do not exist among them to-day. Research workers will verify what I say. The position is not only applicable to the Whites and the Bantu as far as arterial disease is concerned. Take, for instance, liver ailments. The hon. member for Durban (Central) mentioned briefly that liver transplants are being experimented with now. Transplants have already been done where the liver of one person has been transplanted in another person with very moderate success. Since it is known that the Bantu suffer much more frequently from cancer of the liver than white persons, surely the opportunity exists here to find out why. We must give the research workers who want to do the work, the money to do it.; Let them get the tools from us to see if they can find out why these things are happening. There are many research workers in South Africa to-day. They are keen and ready to do the work. We unfortunately also have the subjects on whom the work must be performed. The sick people <span class="col_1735-1736" refersTo="page_0882"/>are there in their thousands. Speak to research workers and they will tell you however that they cannot get the money they want. For these people there must be money and we must find it. General De Gaulle made an appeal to countries throughout the world to give .5 per cent of the money voted for Defence to research into these matters. Mr. Speaker, can you imagine how much money research workers throughout the world would get if that was done. Even in South Africa a large sum of money would flow into the coffers of research workers yearly. The money spent on Defence is to keep us alive and the same applies to these research workers. They want to keep the people alive as well. They want to protect them. I would say that they would possibly have far less wastage of funds through disuse than the Department of Defence. Let us consider the matter in that perspective and see what the Department of Defence can divert from its coffers and let the research workers get that money so that they can carry on with this magnificent work.</p>

<p>This Bill which is a new and an original Bill will, I hope, be copied by other countries. But we must not think for one moment that this is the beginning and the end of legislation in regard to anatomical donations. This is only the beginning and as we progress, as research workers and doctors find ways and means of performing transplants, operations which are looked upon as miracles to-day, will soon become commonplace. When that happens, this Bill will have to be amended again and again and I hope that the Bill takes such a form that it can be amended because of the strides that are made in research work, research work which has only one object, namely to keep man alive. We must, therefore, help these people as much as we possibly can. I suppose that 50 years ago religious bodies would have frowned upon taking a part of one body and putting it into another body. Today, however, by far the majority of religious bodies have the view that the living come first, and thus do not stand in the way of this kind of surgery; they would help rather than hinder it, and it is good to know that this support is coming from all sections of the population.</p>

<p>As far as the provisions of the Bill itself are concerned, looking back to what happened when a certain heart transplant took place, I think that one of the important points that is in this Bill is that the donor and the donor&#x2019;s family and the doctors find security. Secrecy can be kept. I think it is most important that secrecy can be kept if that is the wish of the people involved. If this Bill does not do anything else, it at least lays down that the people who are responsible for taking an organ out of a body and for getting it ready to put into another body cannot be accused of doing something which people may think immoral or illegal.</p>

<p>I want to say that in my opinion it would be absolutely criminal if we were to deny able, capable and willing men opportunities of re search into the major killing diseases just because of money. If we deny these resources to the people who want to do the work, it can only lead to more people dying. More people will die than should die. The standard of health throughout the country can only become lower. I repeat, to do this would be criminal. I appeal to the Government to consider seriously making larger grants to those people who are engaged in this work.</p>

<p>Finally. I want to add my thanks to those extended by the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Durban (Central) to those persons who came and gave evidence and helped us to produce this Bill. I also want to congratulate the Chairman and the officials of the department who spent so much time not only on the proceedings of the Committee&#x2019;s work, but also on preparing the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as a result of the rapid progress made in the technique of transplanting tissues over the past few years, suitable legislation has become extremely necessary and desirable, because there were certain aspects in respect of the process of transplantation which were not stated clearly in the existing legislation. That is why I want to express my thanks to the hon. the Minister for having submitted this Bill to this House last year and for having referred if to a select committee. Then I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to the hon. member for Prinshof, who was chairman of this Select Committee, for the way in which he handled the deliberations of the Committee. It is possible for us to speak appreciatively of the zeal with which he fulfilled his duties. I also want to express my thanks to the other members of this Select Committee for having approached in a scientific manner the evidence submitted to this Committee by learned persons. That is why it has been possible for us to submit for approval to this House to-day such an excellent piece of legislation.</p>

<p>There were several aspects which needed to be clarified further by way of legislation. For instance, the questions I have in mind here are as follows: Who may make donations? Whom may receive such organs? How can such donations be revoked? These things are now being clarified in clause 2.</p>

<p>In clause 3 we find that the much disputed question of the moment of death is now being settled; this question caused a great deal of trouble before, as people claimed that organs were being removed from persons who were as yet not really dead. Medical praotitioners are now afforded protection by clause 3.</p>

<p>I am also grateful that in clause 7 protection is being afforded to minors and mentally disordered or defective persons against undesirable practices against the person of such people.</p>

<p>In clause 9 protection is being afforded to medical practitioners or magistrates acting in <span class="col_1737-1738" refersTo="page_0883"/>good faith by removing tissue or consenting to the removal of tissue for the purposes stated in clause 2.</p>

<p>In clause 10 we find a prohibition in terms of which the tissue or organs of a donor may not be hawked, neither by himself nor by persons authorized to bequeathe some of his organs for transplantation purposes.</p>

<p>In clause 14 the donor and the recipient are being safeguarded against any undesirable publicity. We felt that it was the right of the individual to say whether he wanted any publicity to be given to the fact that he was a donor or that he received such an organ.</p>

<p>I do not want to say any more, I think the matter has already been dealt with quite fully. The legislation is clear and simple. In conclusion I just want to say that I am sure and convinced that medical men and the public outside will be very grateful for this legislation which is before the House to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the Bill we are considering here has once again made all of us realize how great the achievements are which this small nation on the southernmost tip of Africa has accomplished in the sphere of medicine as it has also done in so many other spheres of life. It is with deep gratitude that one thinks of this achievement. That is why I think it would be fitting for me to mention merely in passing to hon. members who have been cloistered here in this House in order to give their attention to this Bill, that after we were 480 runs ahead after the second innings, the present score is 48 for 3.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall drop that topic immediately.</p>

<p>Sir, then I think you will also permit me to tell the hon. member for Geduld, who was also a member of this Select Committee, that in view of his practical experience of medicine extending over many years, this probably was to him not only an opportunity to render a service, but also, as medical practitioner. a great privilege to serve on a select committee of this very nature. I find it striking that this was the very aspect he singled out, namely the aspect of good faith, which may not always be appreciated by the public outside. I think we must accept&#x2014;and this is in fact the basis of this legislation&#x2014;that with all scientists the point of departure should always be the welfare and the well-being of the patient. I am grateful that this has also been written into this legislation and that the hon. member mentioned it.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Prinshof, who was chairman of the Select Committee. I want to say that I am particularly grateful to him for having mentioned the officials of my Department as well as this House, for one does not always realize how much work they have to do on the quiet. The hon. member referred to the publicity aspect. I think that, also as far as this is concerned, we have found a formula for entrenching the rights of the individual with regard to the donor as well as the recipient. There can be no doubt that this legislation is not only farsighted, but also modern.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I should like to thank the hon. member for Rosettenville for his support for this Bill and also join with him in his appeal for more funds for research. This Bill has two aspects; the research aspect, but also the aspect of alleviation of suffering and, in many instances, the cure of certain ailments. I think this aspect should be underlined in this particular discussion, namely the question of bringing happiness, not only to those who are suffering, but also to their relatives and friends.</p>

<p>According to what we have decided on Friday, it is possible to take all the stages of this Bill in one day, but I do not propose to do that. Certain members have been kind enough to come forward to give their amendments to it. I should like to give the most careful and thorough consideration to these amendments. Therefore I propose to take the Committee Stage only to-morrow. I may, however, say that I would be extremely reluctant, unless there are very good reasons, to make amendments to a measure which was unanimously decided upon by all members of the Committee after very careful consideration. But nevertheless, I will give my very careful and thorough consideration to these amendments which members have kindly brought to my notice.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) raised the question of blood transfusion and made the point that blood transfusion in itself is a transplant, a donation of human blood. I should like to take this opportunity to point out that very few transplants of other organs are in reality possible without blood transfusion. It is almost a <i>sine qua non</i> of any transplant. He also made the point that we have a shortage of blood, and especially of certain types of blood. I should like to say here to-day that blood in South Africa is available for all the nations in our country, irrespective of colour. But unfortunately for many reasons which are understandable, most of the blood which is donated, comes from the white nation in South Africa. I should like to make a very strong appeal to-day to all the non-white nations in our country to come forward as donors of human blood. I should like to point out to them that to donate blood, is a completely painless procedure. It leaves no ill effects whatsoever and in many cases improves the health of the donor.</p>

<p>Moreover, I think it is necessary to say that in a number of ailments the donation of blood is a specific treatment for those ailments. In some cases it is a complete cure. I should also like to point out that the greatest care is taken before blood is donated by any person. Perhaps <span class="col_1739-1740" refersTo="page_0884"/>it is not always realized that every one who is prepared to donate blood is very thoroughly examined by experts, this is done completely free of charge. Certain pathological tests are even carried out which are also performed free of charge and which are also to the benefit of donors. I have dwelt on these points for a few moments because I do feel that it should be brought to the notice of all the nations in our country that here is really an opportunity to be of service to our fellow-men. This is an opportunity for all the people in. South Africa. I want to thank the hon. member for his support and for bringing this very important point to the notice of the House this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members are possibly aware of the fact that a group of private persons established a utility company with the object of buying up land on which important South African battles were fought, in order to reconstruct the battlefields thereon and then to hand it over to the National Monuments Council to preserve and maintain it for posterity.</p>

<p>The correct locations and the details of the reconstruction will be determined by the company in consultation with the council and other authoritative historians. In carrying out this and similar undertakings one must expect obstacles will be encountered, most of which can be eliminated through the application of common sense and discretion. Cases may occur, however, where a solution within the framework of existing legislation is well-nigh impossible. Experience has shown, for example, that where large-scale subdivision of land has taken place, it is an impossible task to trace all the owners and come to an agreement with them individually within a measurable space of time. Because of this, and as a result of the inability of the council to act timeously in such cases, the opportunity of preserving some of our most valuable cultural possessions for posterity is lost. As an example in this connection one may mention the problems which the National Monuments Council experienced years ago in the case of Lindley House in Pietermaritzburg when it had no powers of expropriation and was unable to prevent this historical building from being demolished.</p>

<p>Section 5 of the National Monuments Act (Act No. 28 of 1969) provides that the Council may buy, own, hire, let, etc., immovable property. That Act and the Expropriation Act (Act No. 55 of 1965) do not, however, provide that property of aesthetic, historical, archaeological, paleontological or scientific interest in the national sense, may be expropriated in favour of the council. In order to enable the council to fulfil its difficult task, it is deemed necessary to provide for the expropriation of fixed property which has been or is about to be declared a national monument. It may be mentioned that the council supports the Bill wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>The Bill provides for the expropriation of immovable property in terms of the Expropriation Act (Act No. 55 of 1965) for the purposes of the National Monuments Council. As will be noticed, the wording of the Bill agrees with that of section 23<i>ter</i> of the Universities Act (Act No. 61 of 1955) and section 23 pf the Advanced Technical Education Act (Act No. 40 of 1967). It will further be noticed that expropriation will take place not only in favour of the council, but also at its cost. As hon. members will gather from the aforementioned, it will be necessary to make use of the powers granted by this Bill in only a few cases, particularly exceptional ones. Moreover, I give the assurance that the powers will be used only if all reasonable attempts to come to an agreement with. the owner have proved fruitless. Important national monuments cannot, however, be allowed to be lost because the council is not vested with sufficient powers to act when circumstances necessitate it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support this Bill in principle. We realize that there will be cases where the department will have to have the powers which the hon. the Minister is asking for here. There is, of course, doubt in the minds of some of us as to whether the council will not in some case perhaps act unreasonably. Another hon. member will possibly say a few words about this and I would be glad if the hon. the Minister could give us the assurance that the powers granted by this Bill will not be used unfairly.</p>

<p>This Bill does not allow of a wide discussion, but there is nevertheless one matter which I want to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister. I am referring to the question of a memorial tomb for prisoners of war who died during the Second War of Independence (1899-1902). I know that this matter will be covered by this Bill and that the hon. the Minister has already made good progress as regards accepting the principle of erecting such a memorial tomb. As hon. members know, quite a few prisoners of war died abroad. Some of us have seen some of those graves. One hopes that when the Government takes over that land on behalf of the council, it will ensure that these monuments will not be cold gathering-places, but will be something living. What I have in mind, for example, is that the mortal remains of a prisoner of war can be brought from abroad and <span class="col_1741-1742" refersTo="page_0885"/>that such a tomb, as that of &#x201C;the unknown soldier&#x201D;, can represent that of any. person who died as prisoner of war.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I know you will not allow me to enlarge on this, but I do want to raise a third question, i.e. the neglect of such graves of prisoners of war abroad. Although this matter is not actually covered by this Bill, I hope that the hon. the Minister will give serious attention to it in the future. I think it needs to be said that the budget of Ceylon includes an annual amount which is used for the maintenance of the graves of Boer prisoners of war who died there.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was not clear from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech what land this measure is intended to expropriate. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give us some examples in his reply. He gave an example of property, but I presume from the wording of this Bill that it is intended that land can be expropriated. It has been suggested that land which has become famous in South Africa as battlefields or special scenes where there has been conflict in the country might be expropriated. One has to think of the example in Canada, where they have the famous monument at Quebec to General Wolfe and to General Montcalm. That, for many years, was regarded as a very fine monument. However, to-day there are people who find it unpopular. I hope that the hon. the Minister, in considering any of these requests for expropriation, will bear in mind not only what we think to-day, but what our people, our children and our grandchildren will think in 50 years&#x2019; time, or as we usually say, at the turn of the century. I personally, in visiting other countries, have seen many battlefields. But there has never been an attempt to preserve them in the original state. I do not know what the intention is here and what has been suggested. One should consider these attempts to expropriate very carefully.</p>

<p>Another point which I should like to mention is the operation of this Bill. I take it from the wording that the Monuments Committee will first get in touch with the Minister of National Education and after that, will consult with the Minister of Agriculture. Will that be the procedure? Will they first come to the Department of Cultural Affairs and, after that, will there be a consultation between the Minister of National Education and the Minister of Agriculture? I presume that is how it will operate. I hope that, in his reply, the hon. the Minister will explain to us how these requests will be implemented.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to detract at all from our support of this measure. However, there are one or two points which I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. I would be grateful if he would reply to them.</p>

<p>First of all, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is possible that the powers of the council could be delegated to another body. As far as I can see, it is not possible. The council cannot delegate its powers. However, if this is so, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is aware of a private company which is negotiating to purchase a particular battlefield, that I have in mind. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to explain to us how it is that a private company can have these powers. I ask in particular because if one reads the Bill and remembers what the hon. the Minister said in his second-reading speech, it does not line up with the information I have. The Bill states that any land may be expropriated for the benefit of the council provided the council has satisfied the Minister that it is unable to acquire such land on reasonable terms. In his second-reading speech the hon. the Minister said every reasonable effort would be made before these rights are taken under this Bill. However, as I have said, this does not line up with the information that I have in regard to the battlefield of Blood River. I rise particularly to bring this particular point to the hon. the Minister. If this is the sort of thing that can happen, I believe the hon. the Minister should be made aware of it so that it can be brought to a very quick halt. The owners of the farm where the Battle of Blood River took place, were approached by a private company to sell the farm to them. They were hesitant to negotiate with this private company, but they were prepared to co-operate with the council. This private company informed the owner that it was in fact operating with the full knowledge of the Monuments Council. This is why I believe that this is a matter for the hon. the Minister to handle. I have a transcription of an interview conducted by the attorneys of the owners with a member of this body. He makes such claims in this transcription as that if the owners refuse to sell the farm, they will use sledge-hammer tactics. In this interview he says that he does not make idle threats; that he is working in close co-operation with the Prime Minister and that the Prime Minister has promised him this Bill before the end of this Session. That is why he says that, if the owners do not sell, he can expropriate. I will give the hon. the Minister a copy of the transcript of this interview if he wishes. It was taken from a tape-recording. I will let him have this and he can see for himself that the tactics used by these people certainly do not line up with the views that he expressed now in his second-reading speech. I want to make it quite clear to the hon. the Minister that the owners concerned are only too willing to co-operate with the National Monuments Commission. That has never been in question. They have pointed out one or two differences. For instance, they do not necessarily agree that the team of experts have settled the actual site of the battle. However, that is not a matter for me to raise here. I want to emphasize the fact that they are willing to co-operate. But I do suggest that the National Monuments Commission should handle this matter themselves, because this <span class="col_1743-1744" refersTo="page_0886"/>private company has used threats against the owners of this farm.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as hon. members know, we on this side of the House want to support this Bill. We believe it is necessary. There will probably be cases where expropriation will have to take place. Of course, we also want to draw attention to the fact that something like that must be done very carefully. We have already heard of cases in which such careful action was not taken. If this is in fact the case, the matter must be investigated very thoroughly. The National Monuments Commission must have the right to expropriate land where it is really necessary, but these powers must be used very carefully.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to put a short question to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister did refer in his motivation for this legislation before us, to the possibility of the expropriation of battlefields monuments. I wonder why the hon. the Minister has thought it necessary to bring the control of the battlefield monuments under the National Monuments Council and not to utilize the National War Graves Board which has been established, as the hon. the Minister knows, to deal with not only the maintenance of memorials and war graves appertaining to past conflicts in South Africa, but also to establish gardens of remembrance and the like in various parts of the Republic. Therefore, the hon. the Minister will be aware of the extent of the work that has already been done by the board. One would have imagined that this offer which the hon. the Minister referred to, the offer of private persons to finance further monuments which are connected with the war history of South Africa, might well have been entrusted to the War Graves Board. The control, management and establishment of these monuments might have existed more happily within the purview of the War Graves Board rather than under the National Monuments Commission&#x2019;s control. I should like the hon. the Minister to indicate to us why that particular line of authority was not considered as more appropriate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I want to express my sincere thanks to the hon. the Opposition for the support which they have given to this Bill. I think the matter concerned here is one which is close to the hearts of all of us. We can therefore see eye to eye on it. I immediately want to give hon. members on the other side of the House as well as hon. members on this side of the House the assurance that these powers of expropriation will be used with the greatest discretion and care. In fact, I believe that powers of expropriation must at all times be used with great caution. No one likes to be deprived of his property, and even less so if it is done in an unreasonable way.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask file hon. the Minister a question? What body will actually exercise the powers of expropriation, if they are found necessary?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I shall come to that. In the first place I therefore give my assurance that any action that is taken will be taken judiciously. The procedure being prescribed is that the National Monuments Council will continue to do its work in terms of the Act which established it. It means that an investigation is first instituted as to whether such a place is of historal, aesthetic or archaeological value to the country in a national sense. If it is satisfied that that is the position, provisional notice is given to the owner of such a place that the property is under provisional declaration as a national monument. This means that for a period of three years negotiations can take place to have the monument, memorial or whatever the case may be, finally declared a national monument. The problem with the existing legislation is in fact that in the meantime a great deal can happen which can frustrate the best intentions of the council in this connection.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the powers of expropriation. What is going to happen here, is that the National Monuments Council will continue with its task as laid down in the Act. When the council encounters obstacles which cannot be removed within the framework of the legislation concerned, it reports to the Minister of National Education, who will, in consultation with the Minister of finance, address a request to the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. From that stage onwards the procedure followed is as defined by the Expropriation Act. In other words, the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure will do the expropriation. They will do it on behalf of and at the expense of the National Monuments Council. The National Monuments Council will, in other words, become the owner of that expropriated property. I think that answers the question of the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the representations made by the hon. member for Sea Point in connection with a memorial tomb. I want to tell him that the Cabinet has already approved in principle that a memorial tomb may be erected, but the details in that connection is something about which no decision has been taken yet. The War Graves Board must put forward concrete proposals and when these are received, the Cabinet will consider which of them, it can agree to. I may just say that I am aware of the fact that the hon. member for Sea Point already made representations to my predecessor in this connection. There are, of course, major obstacles in connection with those suggestions <span class="col_1745-1746" refersTo="page_0887"/>made by him. The obstacles will arise from the fact that it will involve negotiations with foreign powers. I think the hon. member must in the meantime content himself with the fact that we are aware of these suggestions. When the plan of the War Graves Board is submitted to us, we can go into the matter further.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington asked what the procedure in connection with expropriation will be. I think I have already replied to that in part. He also warned that great care should be taken not to expropriate land for the erection of some memorial or other which in later years will no longer meet with the approval of certain people or of certain sections of the population. This matter which the hon. member raised is a very substantial one and I think I shall be able to satisfy him if I say that the National Monuments Council, which is composed of historians, will provide the best guidance here. It goes without saying that they will take care that sites are not expropriated and memorials are not erected which may subsequently be regretted.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal also sounded a note of warning in connection with expropriation. He furnished information about attempts allegedly being made in Natal to obtain portions of the Blood River site. If the position is as the hon. member stated, and I readily accept that he would not make a wild statement about this matter to the House, I must say that the persons or bodies that did that probably acted injudiciously in that connection. I should like to go into the matter and try to put a stop to it. It stands to reason that I cannot prevent speculators who got wind of this scheme as a result of newspaper reports, from trying to obtain land. I do not know whether this is the case to which the hon. member referred, but there is such a possibility as well. I think I can satisfy the hon. member by saying that where the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure necessarily had to expropriate property, they have always been reasonable. In most cases of which I know, the owners of such land were satisfied with the negotiations, which were conducted on this high level. I can give the hon. member the assurance that that will happen in this case as well. If there have been abuses before, I am sorry. The hon. member will realize that I have no control over that, but I shall try to put a stop to them if they do occur.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens also sounded a note of warning and I think I have already replied to him as well. I can assure him that we will act judiciously and carefully.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point asked why the War Graves Board could not deal with this matter. It is a fact that both these bodies exist, but each of them has different functions entrusted to it by the Act which established it. The task of the National Monuments Council is to declare national monuments and to preserve them for posterity. This is not specifically the task of the War Graves Board. The distinction was in fact drawn by the Act and therefore we have to follow this pattern.</p>

<p>I think I have replied to all the questions asked by hon. members and I want to express my thanks once again to the hon. members on the other side of the House for the support I have received from them in connection with this measure.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the amendments contained in this Bill became necessary as a result of one important factor, i.e. a change in the price structure in the wine industry. Since the passing of the Amendment Act of 1940, whereby control over good wine was introduced in the industry, up to and including 1947, the price of good wine was quite a bit less than that of distilling wine. Subsequently the price of good wine was fixed at a level higher than that for distilling wine, but up to 1962 the difference was, however, very slight.</p>

<p>After 1962 the discrepancy between the two prices increased considerably, in favour of good wine. As a result of this provision must now be made in certain cases for problems resulting from the price adjustments. The annually fixed price for good wine applies to wine of a strength of up to 20 per cent proof spirit. However, at present the Act provides that an additional amount must be paid per leaguer for each 1 per cent that good wine exceeds 20 per cent proof spirit in strength. Up to now this additional amount was calculated on the distilling wine price less the levies upon surplus contributions made by K.W.V. members in respect of the surplus distilling wine. It is now proposed that the aforementioned amount shall in future be calculated on the total distilling wine price, i.e. before deductions of the surplus amount. For the additional alcohol in good wine above 20 per cent proof spirit, at least the distilling wine price will consequently have to be paid. This is obviously the price traders would otherwise have had to pay if they themselves had bought the alcohol and added it to the good wine. This proposed amendment is a direct consequence of the changed circumstances that have set in during recent years with respect to the price structure to which I have already referred.</p>

<p><span class="col_1747-1748" refersTo="page_0888"/>A procedure and principle that has always applied in the wine industry in respect of good wine, i.e. that the trade receives wine from the wine farmer or the co-operative cellar, is, in addition, merely being clarified in the Bill. Neither will the wine producer be allowed to make any contribution to the costs of the transport of his wine by the trade, except in the circumstances described in the Bill. In this connection it is proposed that a producer, situated far from the premises of a trader, can be authorized by the K.W.V. to make a contribution to the costs of transporting his good wine. This will only be possible if the wine is to be transported over a greater distance than a distance prescribed by the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>. The contribution will also be determined on a basis and upon conditions approved by the Minister, and there shall, in addition, be a right of appeal to the Minister in cases where the K.W.V. refuses to allow a contribution to the transport costs of the wine in the circumstances for which provision is being made.</p>

<p>In transactions where one producer buys grapes from another producer, the Act at present merely provides that the price may not be less than the distilling wine price less the surplus contribution. As a result of the increases in the price of good wine since 1940, this price for grapes is no longer a realistic one. Such grapes are purchased for the making of good wine, and if grapes for this purpose are purchased at the distilling wine price (which is already quite a bit less than the good wine price) minus the surplus contribution as well, it enables the purchaser to make considerable profits. No wonder, therefore, that the situation is now being exploited in that traders, by means of related producer-organizations, are obtaining large quantities of grapes in this way. The financial advantage obtained by such traders over other traders, who only purchase their wines from producers, is not beneficial to the wine industry.</p>

<p>In this Bill provision is now being made for the price of grapes to be based on the price for good wine and that all such transactions for the purchasing of grapes should take place through the agency of the K.W.V. In addition, provision is made for the K.W.V., with the approval of the Minister, to fix an amount in any year by which the above-mentioned price can be reduced. The Minister can also, in any year, instruct the K.W.V. to submit proposals to him in respect of such a deduction for that year. The intention is that if it should appear that the proposed price would possibly entail hardships for producers, the price could be fixed at a lower level than the good wine price for the year concerned. Interested parties will be granted the opportunity of objecting to the Minister about the amount of the price reduction which the K.W.V. may suggest.</p>

<p>An additional new provision is that the fixing of the price of distilling wine, as is. the case already with good wine, will now also be subject to the Minister&#x2019;s approval. Provision is being made for the submission of objections against the distilling wine price which the K.W.V. may suggest, and the procedure to be followed in this connection is the same as that in respect of good wine.</p>

<p>Wine farmers and co-operative societies will now be prohibited from purchasing distilling wine from other wine farmers or co-operative societies. The object here is to prevent evasions and manipulations, for example where grapes are also bought by one wine farmer from another for good wine purposes and where such grapes are pressed together with the farmer&#x2019;s own grapes.</p>

<p>With a view to preventing any misuse of the concession which the Act at present contains in respect of the right of appeal of someone whose interests are affected by a decision of the K.W.V., it is proposed that such right of appeal shall fall away if the appellant were to neglect to nominate his representative on the board of appeal within a fixed time. It is further proposed that authority be granted for the issuing of regulations whereby the procedure for the obtaining of the Minister&#x2019;s approval and the lodging and prosecution of appeals can be prescribed.</p>

<p>In the light of the fact that it has already been decided to submit all the wine-marketing Acts to Parliament for consolidation and incorporation into one Act, it is first necessary for a number of technical amendments to be made in the Acts concerned, before consolidation takes place.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support this Bill. The Acts that are to be amended by this Bill have a bearing on the regulation of the production of wine and spirituous liquor from the vine and also on the marketing of those products by their producers. It is legislation that is trying to ensure the orderly production and marketing of these products, and it includes regulations and prescriptions applied and implemented by the Ko&#x00F6;peratiewe Wijnbouwersvereniging van Z.A. Beperk (commonly known as K.W.V.). In passing it is interesting to note that the K.W.V. is an organization which had its origins here in our country, having been created in 1917 by our previous generation of wine farmers themselves in order to try and overcome the great problems they were faced with at the time. The organization was registered as a company at the beginning of 1918 because at the time there was, of course, no Act that made provision for the registration of cooperative organizations. Such an Act was only to come onto the Statute Book in 1922. But what is illuminating is that, although most of our previous generations of wine farmers came from the wine-producing countries of Europe, there is nothing at all like the K.W.V. in any of those countries.</p>

<p>It is therefore not modelled on anything for which there is or was a precedent in any of those countries, or even elsewhere. I understand further that there are many of those <span class="col_1749-1750" refersTo="page_0889"/>countries that would very much have liked something like that. In many of the countries, so I am told, there is a total lack of this kind of control and of such an organization to apply that control at producer-level. The State itself must regulate the industry and it costs the governments of those wine-producing countries a very great deal of money. Here in the Republic this industry stands on its own feet. It receives little or no financial support from the State and must simply tackle and solve its own problems and, in most cases, see how best to fend for itself. However, what the State does rather well is to tax the industry&#x2019;s products &#x2026;</p>

<p>If I may not speak about taxes, let me then just say that the least that can be done is to adjust the necessary authorizations by legislation from time to time in order to help the industry to overcome, through the proper regulation of its affairs, problems which arise in the course of time and with changing circumstances. And this is also what this Bill proposes to do. Sir, that the regulation of the measure of control applied in the industry is being supplemented by legislation is also nothing new. The K.W.V. is a voluntary organization, a co-operative, and as far back as the. early twenties it was clear that certain regulations in respect of turn over were not only to be binding on members of the K.W.V. (because as a co-operative society they can only bind their own members) but that important regulations, such as those in respect of the price, should also be applicable to non-members. This had to be done by legislation. This was also the first legislation that had to help stabilize the industry, and this legislation was laid down by Act No. 5 of 1924, which was piloted through Parliament at the time by none other than the then Prime Minister himself, General Smuts.</p>

<p>I do not want to move amendments. I just want to say that we welcome certain amendments introduced here, and for that reason we shall vote for the Bill. If you want us to oppose it we can do that as well. However, I would rather like to support this Bill; the Minister would also like it. Mr. Speaker, these wine Acts are complicated. The hon. the Minister spoke here of good wine. I did not want to get him into trouble, Sir, but you are now going to cause this to happen, because I am now going to ask him what the difference is between good wine and bad wine. They come from the same cask. This whole matter is a complicated one. Powers are now being granted here for the purchaser of good wine to be compensated for his transport costs if he lives sufficiently far away. All this Bill means&#x2014;and that is why I am supporting it&#x2014; is that the purchaser must buy so much good wine and so much distilling wine; it can come from the same cask. Previously there was discrimination against farmers who lived far from the distilleries. We are grateful that the Minister is now granting the powers for that person&#x2019;s transport costs to be repaid to him. People situated far from the distillery will now also have the benefit of good wine prices. Do you now see. Mr. Speaker, how complicated the matter is? It is not simply any man who can come along here and speak about this kind of matter.</p>

<p>There is only one aspect of the Bill that bothers us a little. It does not actually bother us. but we would nevertheless like to tell the hon. the Minister to watch his step. I refer to the powers the Minister is now adopting in connection with the fixing of prices. Previously the K.W.V. fixed the prices. It is indeed true that the Minister could fix the prices of so-called good wine since 1958, if I remember correctly. The Minister now has the power to fix the prices of all wines. We shall trust him with that power. [Interjections.] Yes, we shall trust him but we shall be looking to see how he behaves himself. I just want to say that when the K.W.V. alone had that power&#x2014;and it had it for many years&#x2014;it used that power in such a way, if I remember correctly, that there was only one appeal in all the years of the liquor trade. There was only one appeal and that was decided in favour of the K.W.V. Since the Minister makes so much money from this industry, we just want to ask him not to poke his nose unnecessarily into the affairs of the wine farmers. I think this is a very reasonable request. The K.W.V. has a proud record &#x2014;more so than this Government&#x2019;s record.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point, who has just resumed his seat, went back a long way to quote what General Smuts said. I wonder if he should not have gone back a little further because Noah also said something about wine. Sir, I shall not go back that far. The hon. member tried to get in a sidelong jab by saying that the Government was doing nothing for the wine farmer at all. He was with me in this House when, a few years ago, this Government made no less than R500,000 available for research and for the development of the wine industry. How can he then say that this Government is doing nothing for the wine industry? I want to emphasize that this Bill is a result of direct requests from the K.W.V. The K.W.V. Board is different in its composition to a control board; it is exclusively composed of wine farmers, producers, people who want to do nothing but promote and serve the interests of the wine industry. And let me simply make it clear now. They are leaders of the wine farmers, and just as high winds blow on high hills, they are also criticized, and there are also wine farmers who criticize their actions, but the broad stratum of wine farmers supports these directors of the K.W.V. and will also support them in requesting this Bill. That is also why the members representing wine districts here, heartily support this Bill. But these changes requested in the Bill have become very necessary because the whole pattern of wine production has changed so remarkably in recent years. It is with a measure of nostalgia that we must take leave of one estate wine producer after another. I am thinking, for example, of one of the most palatable red wines I have ever tasted, the 1954 Zonnebloem Cabernet. That farm is no longer making wine to-day, and we must nostalgically take leave of this famous wine maker of a decade ago. Conditions have changed so much now that a very great deal, of capital is necessary for the making of good wine.</p>

<p>It is because changes have come to pass here that this Bill is necessary, because the individual wine farmer can no longer muster the capital to make good wine. The hon. member for Sea Point asked the hon. the Deputy Minister what good wine is. and he spoke of good wine and distilling wine that came from the same cask. Sir, good wine, as defined by the Act, means wine that is used as wine, while distilling wine can be any wine that is distilled. But good wine is that wine which is used as wine. A trader who distills wine can also use good wine to distill brandy. He is at liberty to purchase good wine and to do with it whatever he wants to, but if <span class="col_1753-1754" refersTo="page_0891"/>he then distills it he must pay the relevant price.</p>

<p>I said that these changes had become very necessary, because in the course of time it is only the wine cooperatives making wine, and recently more and more traders, who buy grapes and then make wine from them. But now there has been an additional new development, i.e. that traders no longer buy the grapes; they buy the sweet must, the unfermented grape juice, from the farmer, and from that they then manufacture wine. Up to a few years ago only mechanical refrigeration was necessary for the manufacture of very good wine, but then a new fashion set in. Everyone now wants to drink this sweetish, light wine, the wine which is wrongly called a Stein type. I say wrongly, because to make this new kind of wine it is also necessary to have expensive calefactory apparatus in those cellars.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Opposition for supporting the Bill. There is only one point, to which the hon. member for Sea Point referred, that has not been replied to yet, i.e. that in 1924 the tax on a bottle of wine was 10 cents. This is true, but I have ascertained that in 1924 the price of a bottle of Limosin was a little more than 30 cents. So the tax-price relationship between was more or less the same as it is to-day. We cannot actually wrench the position out of context and look at what happened in 1924.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>There is no need for me to make a lengthy speech on this measure. From the nature of the case the proposals are not contentious. Existing rights or privileges of pensioners or officials are not being adversely affected. On the contrary, as is usual under a good Government such as this one, additional rights and improved privileges are continually being added.</p>

<p>However, I want to deal briefly with the provisions for the information of hon. members.</p>

<p>The Provincial Powers Extension Act empowers the Provincial Councils to make ordinances as regards pensions for members or the widows of members of a provincial council or an executive committee, but limit these pensions to half of the yearly allowance of a member. The maximum pension a member of an executive committee can earn for himself, was increased to R6,000 per year with effect from 1st September, 1969, which is more than the permissible half of his annual allowances. The Provincial ordinances will, therefore, have to be amended to provide for the new maximum pensions, but this cannot be done until such time as the limit in the said Act has been suspended or at least relaxed. In order to follow the pattern of the Parliamentary pension scheme, clause 1 is intended to enable the provincial authorities to bring the maximum pensions into line with the annual allowance if they deem it necessary to do so.</p>

<p>In drawing up section 6 (13A), inserted in the Government Service Pensions Act, 1965, last year, it was accepted that the Durban Corporation <span class="col_1755-1756" refersTo="page_0892"/>Telephone Employees Transfer Act, 1969, would come into operation on 1st April. 1969. However, the said Act only came into operation on the date of proclamation (27th June, 1969), and clause 2 will rectify the position. In order to facilitate administration the reference to the Public Service Commission in sections 8 (5) and 8 (6) of the Government Service Pensions Act, 1965, is being deleted in clause 3 at the request of the Department of Prisons. The Public Service Commission and the Commissioner of Police are agreed on this.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary pension scheme, as it exists at present, makes no provision for the payment of benefits to minor children of a member and members of the scheme are quite rightly concerned about the position in which such children will find themselves in case both parents should die. It has therefore been decided that pensions and other benefits should be paid under the Parliamentary Pension Scheme to minor children of a member who dies in service and who does not leave behind a widow. Provision is being made in this respect in clauses 4, 5 and 7, while consequential amendments are contained in clauses 6, 8, 9 and 10. The provisions of the Bill as regards this matter were agreed to after consultation with the members of both sides of this House, and I trust that these will meet with general support. In this connection I should like to add that the proposed provisions can also be construed as applying to minor children of female members.</p>

<p>Hon. members will note that a minor amendment is being effected to the definition of &#x2019; &#x201C;commissioner general&#x201D; under clause 4. which has, however, nothing to do with the said concessions as regards children, but is necessary in order to retain the pension rights in the case of a person appointed directly from parliamentary ranks to serve in that position in the territory of South West Africa.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 11 the bonus payable in respect of war pensions is being increased from 10 per cent to 12&#x00BD; per cent, as has been announced.</p>

<p>Certain female teachers on the temporary staff belonged to the provincial pension funds for many years, but were at the time of the establishment of the Provincial and Territory Service Pension Fund on 1st April, 1969, excluded from membership of that fund by virtue of the fact that they were being appointed in a temporary capacity. The relevant Act only provides for the refund of personal contributions made prior to 1st April, 1969, plus interest. Such persons are now afforded the opportunity in terms of clause 12 to become members of the said fund but limits their benefits to those they were entitled to prior to 1st April, 1969, while affording them the choice to have the contributions paid back to them if they so desire.</p>

<p>Certain institutions, the staff of which were members of I provincial pension funds were, with effect from 1st April, 1969. established as schools or declared aided schools in terms of the Educational Services Act, 1967. Section 21 of the Pensions Laws Amendment Act, 1969, provides, in the first place, for the retention of pensions rights and for the age of retirement of persons who were employed with such institutions on 31st March, 1969. Since all provincial funds were incorporated in the Provincial and the Territory Service Pension Fund on 1st April, 1969, the moneys of the said persons are merely being kept in that fund and they are not members of that fund in the true sense of the word. In the second place, they could decide whether they wanted to become members of the Public Service Pension Fund, in which case the benefits would be transferred to the latter fund. To be able to do this, such a person must be deemed to have been a member of the Provincial and Territory Pension Fund, and provision for this is now being made in terms of clause 13 (1) (a). The present provision does not provide for the retention of ages of retirement in the case of somebody who has decided to become a member of the Public Service Pension Fund, and the insertion under clause 13 (1) (b) is therefore required for this purpose.</p>

<p>Except for other minor amendments to facilitate implementation and administration, clause 14 mainly provides for the extension of the scheme for the payment of temporary allowances also with effect from 1st April, 1970, to retired members of the Associated Institutions Pension Fund and members of the provident funds for technical colleges and universities who are in receipt of annuities.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened with interest to the hon. the Minister introducing the Bill that is now before the House. We on this side of the House intend supporting the Bill at the Second Reading and in all its stages. We believe that this Bill is one which brings about improvements in the administration of the various Acts it aims to amend and also incorporates improvements which were announced by the Minister of finance during the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill. We believe that it is important, where administrative difficulties are experienced,, that they should be rectified as soon as possible. That is why we are particularly pleased to see that the amendments which have been made to the Provincial and the Territory Service Pension Act will eliminate certain difficulties that have arisen, although this Act was only passed by this House last year.</p>

<p>We believe that the proposed amendment to the Parliamentary Service and Administrators&#x2019; Pension Act is also an important provision. Where dependent children, whose parents are members of one of the Houses of Parliament, are deprived of their support, provision is now being made for a payment to be made to these children from-the Parliamentary Service Pension Fund. This is a provision which exists in other pension Acts and it is only right and just that such a provision should be made under the Parliamentary Service and Administrators&#x2019; <span class="col_1757-1758" refersTo="page_0893"/>Pensions Act, so that such an eventuality, if it should arise can be met.</p>

<p>There is one particular aspect of the Bill upon which I should like to pass further comment. In terms of the statement made by the Minister of finance during the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill, provision was made for increases of social pensions and also for the consolidation of a certain part of the bonus, which would bring about the relaxation of the means test. This is obviously now done by regulation. It is therefore not possible for me to discuss these matters as they are not before the House. However, in terms of one of the clauses, namely clause 11 of this Bill, provision is made to give legislative effect to one of the proposals made by the hon. the Minister of finance. Here I refer to the proposed increase in bonuses. If we look at the position of military pensioners, we notice that there are two Acts which govern the payment of war disablement pensions, namely the War Special Pensions Act, 1962, which deals with wars prior to and including the 1914-&#x2019;18 war, and the war Pensions Act of 1967, which deals with other disablement pensions paid to certain other categories of ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen. If we look at this position we see that improvements have been made over the years. Certainly in 1965, when a consolidation took place, there Was a considerable improvement in the pensions being paid io these various groups.</p>

<p>The position since then has, however, not been quite as satisfactory as we believe it should have been. The principle of paying a bonus as contained in clause 11 is one which we endeavour to get away from so that wherever possible such bonuses can be consolidated with the basic amounts. In 1968 the bonus of 10 per cent was granted by this House. The Bill before us now intends increasing this bonus to <i>I2i</i> per cent but first and foremost we are extremely disappointed that it is only possible that this bonus should be increased by only 2&#x00BD; per cent of the payment that is made. If you look at the number of military pensioners that is involved, you find that it is not a large number in comparison with other groups of pensioners. Approximately 20,000 such persons are receiving pensions and thereby qualify for the increased bonus for which this Bill provides. It seems a pity that it was not possible to pay a more generous bonus to this particular group of pensioners. I should like briefly to draw a comparison between the war-disabled pensioners who will receive this increase and social pensioners. In 1968 social pensions were also increased by R1 per month. They were increased again in 1969 and in 1970 a further increase is to come into operation as from the 1st April. Old-age pensions for instance, increased from R32, in 1968. to R35 per month which was an increase of R3 per month. This represents an increase of just less than 9 per cent. In 1968 the pensions of war veterans were increased from R40 to R43 per month in 1970. This represents a per cent increase in pension. The group whose bonus is to be increased by this Bill, however, received no increase whatsoever during 1969. They did receive the original 10 per cent increase in 1968, but the increase of this bonus now to 12&#x00BD; per cent means a net increase of only 21/4 per cent, if one makes a percentage calculation. This Bill therefore only provides for a net increase of 21/4 per cent as far as their war-disablement pensions are concerned whereas the other groups of pensioners have received increases far in excess of this amount. I hope that the hon. the Minister can perhaps give us an explanation as to why this group should appear to have been left behind as far as increases are concerned. I realize that he has difficulties and that he has to co-operate with the Minister of finance and that there are only certain funds available to him.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I should like to raise, namely the question of the effective date of many of these clauses. I realize that from an administrative point of view it is necessary that some of them should be retrospective. In this particular case the increased bonus is effective from the 1st April, 1970. I hope that the hon. the Minister is now creating a precedent whereby the increases that are granted from time to time will coincide with the start of the financial year and be payable from the 1st April as is the case with the increase provided for in the Bill before us. The increases granted in 1966 were made effective from the 1st April, but during the last three years the increases have only been payable from the 1st October of each year. We understand that this is due to administrative difficulties. I hope that these administrative difficulties have now been overcome and that the hon. the Minister can indicate to the House whether in future it will be possible to grant these increases with effect from 1st April, the beginning of each financial year. I refer to improvements made to both this kind of pension and civil pensions. Mr. Speaker, we have pleasure in supporting this Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. member for Umbilo for having given his support to this measure. The hon. member raised two minor matters which I should like to elucidate further. According to the hon. member the 2&#x00BD; per cent increase in respect of war pensions, as compared with old-age pensions, is not a fair one. I should like to mention a few points to him in this regard. In the first place, war pensions in general are considerably, higher than old-age pensions. The war pensions being received by the majority of widows amount to almost R74 per month as against the present R33 per month in respect of old-age pensions. To-day a war widow with children may receive as much as R129 per month. In the second place, war pensioners also receive supplementary allowances apart from the basic pension. The allowances are also taken into consideration for the purpose <span class="col_1759-1760" refersTo="page_0894"/>of calculating the bonus. In other words, the bonus is not necessarily based on the basic pension only, but on the basic pension plus the allowances payble. In the third place, the majority of widows who are in receipt of war pensions and who have minor children, also qualify for a civil allowance and, in fact, a maintenance allowance in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act. Apart from the 2&#x00BD; per cent concession such people are receiving at present, they also qualify for all the concessions which have been announced in respect of civil pensions and allowances by the Minister of finance in the Part Appropriation. The majority of war pensioners over the age of 70 years are also in receipt of war veterans pensions. The wives of a great number of these people receive old-age pensions. In many cases they are also, therefore, enjoying the benefits of the concessions in respect of civil pensions. Fifthly, it should be borne in mind that the bonus these people receive is not regarded as income when applications for a civil pension or allowance is made. Any increase in the bonus does not, therefore mean a reduction of the civil pension or allowance, something which is an additional benefit as far as these people are concerned. In the sixth place, to the large majority of war pensioners who do not qualify for a civil pension, this war pension is not their only source of income. Persons belonging to the latter group are in many cases still in a position to hold their own in the open labour market. With these few arguments I mentioned, I want to make it quite clear that we are in the position of having had to choose precisely which people had to be assisted with this amount of money. We thought in all honesty that these people are being assisted and may find assistance in so many other respects, that we have decided to do it in this way. We are not unsympathetic towards these people, but we have to cut our coat according to our cloth. We cannot, of course, do anything else.</p>

<p>One other matter that was raised by the hon. members, was the Question of the payments which are going to be made with effect from 1st April. The hon. member expressed the hope that this was a principle that was being approved so that payments could be made on 1st April in future. I want to tell him straight away that I wish it were the case, but unfortunately it is not. It cannot be. This year is different to others in that we have a short session and will have a second session later this year. Calculations are made by the computer after proper programming. Payments cannot be made with retrospective effect unless such arrear payments are calculated manually by the officials for every individual case. In view of the manpower shortage this is not possible. In addition, we have the continuous stream of inquiries from the public to deal with, creating further problems and causing considerable delays. The second reason why concessions and civil pensions were usually paid as from 1st October in the past, is because the Budget Speech usually takes place towards the end of March in a normal year. Changes in civil pensions require financial legislation to be introduced and amendments to be effected to the relevant regulations, which is usually done only towards the end of the session. In other words, the legislation is not approved until May. Under these circumstances the money cannot be paid out with effect from 1st April. In those cases it has to be paid out with effect from 1st October. In the third place, it has been made possible for payments to be made with effect from 1st April this year by virtue of the fact that the introduction of the necessary legislation and the amendment of the regulations took place in time. This has already been approved. In other words, we can start immediately with the necessary programming for the computer and payments can be made on the specific date.</p>

<p>There is yet another argument which to my mind is a strong one. I mention this in conclusion. If these concessions had been announced during the second session of Parliament, it would have created problems in that it would have been impossible for these concessions to be paid out in October, but would have had to be held in abyeance until the following year because it would not have been possible to promulgate in time the financial legislation authorizing the expenditure. For that reason it is necessary in this particular year with the two sessions to approve the legislation and to make these payable with effect from 1st April.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill contains amendments to four Acts, namely the Insurance Act, the Pension Funds Act, the Banks Act and the Building Societies Act. The proposed amendments to the Insurance Act and the Pension Funds Act affect the investments which insurers and pension funds have to hold in prescribed assets. In terms of both Acts, one of the classes of prescribed <span class="col_1761-1762" refersTo="page_0895"/>assets is the loans issued or guaranteed by certain institutions approved by the Registrar. In terms of the Insurance Act, the institutions which the Registrar may approve are limited to those similar to local authorities and utility undertakings such as Escom and the Rand Water Board. The proposed amendments to the relative provisions of the Insurance Act will remove the restrictions and give the Registrar a wider discretion to add new kinds of institutions to the list of approved institutions, subject to such conditions as he may impose. Under the Pension Funds Act, the Registrar has wider powers to approve institutions than under the Insurance Act, but also under this Act it is limited to the approval of institutions. The powers conferred by these two Acts, do not cover the approval of particular loans. In order to include a particular loan the prescribed class of assets, the only alternative at present is to approve the institution which issued or guaranteed that loan. Now the proposed amendments will extend the powers of the Registrar so as to cover under both Acts particular loans as well.</p>

<p>A further effect which the proposed amendments to both the Insurance Act and the Pension Funds Act will have is that an institution which has been approved by the Registrar, will henceforth not be able to extend the list of prescribed assets by in turn guaranteeing other loans. Only the loans which the approved institutions issue, and not also those which they have guaranteed, will rank as prescribed assets. This curtailment has become necessary in order to eliminate the anomaly which arises when the registrar refuses to approve an institution and his refusal is circumvented in that loans of the refused institution are guaranteed by another institution which the Registrar has previously approved. This much as regards the amendments to the Insurance Act and the Pension Funds Act.</p>

<p>I now come to the Banks Act. The minimum amounts of paid-up capital, unimpaired reserve funds, and liquid assets which a banking institution has to maintain, are based on its liabilities to the public. A commercial bank, but not another kind of banking institution, may decrease its liabilities to the public by an amount equal to 50 per cent of its remittances in transit. This deduction which commercial banks may make, places them in a more favourable position than other banking institutions which also accept deposits which may be withdrawn by means of cheques and which have a branch system, but have not yet been classified as commercial banks. There is no sound reason why the latter should not enjoy this concession as well; consequently the concession was granted to them last year. The proposed amendment will now confirm the new position with retrospective effect. The next amendment to the Banks Act is consequential upon the concession granted to banking institutions and building societies last year to accept larger deposits on savings accounts. If is known that as a result of strong competition, <i>inter alia</i>, from unit trust schemes, building societies have been finding it impossible in recent times to draw sufficient funds from the public in order to satisfy the demand for housing loans. When the net flow of funds to building societies virtually came to a standstill last year, it was necessary to make certain concessions to building societies without any delay, in order to mobilize more funds from the public for housing purposes. On 5th August, 1969, building societies were allowed, <i>inter alia</i>, to exceed the statutory amount of R6,000, which may be accepted from a person on a savings account, and to accept up to R10,000 on such an account. In all fairness, the same concession was granted to banking institutions which were subject to similar limitations. In order to legalize this concession, it is necessary for the Act to be amended with retrospective effect. The Banks Act prohibits the use of the word &#x201C;bank&#x201D;, and derivatives thereof, in the name or description of undertakings which are not registered as banking institutions, unless the Minister has given permission thereto. The purpose of this control is to prevent confusion and deception. The principles on which applications are judged, are clear, and there is therefore no sound reason why the Minister should be troubled with the numerous applications for permission which are received. They can be dealt with just as well by the Registrar, as indeed, happens in the case of the other Acts which the Registrar of Financial Institutions administers and which contain similar restrictions on the use of names. In any event, the Banks Act already makes provision for the right of appeal to the Minister against any decision of the Registrar. This Act is therefore being amended in order to entrust the judgment of these applications to the Registrar.</p>

<p>I now come to the amendments to the Building Societies Act. In dealing with the amendments to the Banks Act, I mentioned the relaxation of the limits on amounts which building societies may accept on savings accounts. In order to legalize last year&#x2019;s concession, the Act has to be amended with retrospective effect in order to raise the limit from R6,000 to R10,000. In the case of the small building societies, the limit is being raised from R2,000 to R3,500. The next amendment to the Building Societies Act makes provision for the issue of a new type of share by building societies. Where a building society has issued an indefinite or fixed period share with a fixed rate of dividend, the Bill is authorizing the building society, in spite of the conditions on which the share has been issued, to decrease the rate of dividend from time to time after at least one month&#x2019;s written notice has been given to the shareholder. It stands to reason that this power which the Bill is giving building societies makes building society shares less attractive to the investor than long-term investments. In order to enable building societies to offer investors a more attractive long-term investment, permission was granted last year, in anticipation of authorizing legislation, for building societies to issue a special fixed period share <span class="col_1763-1764" refersTo="page_0896"/>with a fixed rate of dividend which will remain unaltered for the full currency of the share. Except in special circumstances, these shares may be redeemed only after the expiry of the full period of issue, and they may also not serve as security for a loan from the society which issued the shares. The proposed amendments now authorize, with retrospective effect the issue of these shares.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, there is the increase in the present maximum amount of R10,000 which a newly established building society may at present grant against the security of a mortgage of urban immovable property. When this limitation was inserted in the Act in 1961. it was thought that a new building society should refrain from granting relatively large mortgage bonds and that the limit of R10,000 was reasonable as an advance in respect of a dwelling-house. In the present circumstances a limit of R10,000 is unrealistic; hence the proposal that it should be increased. A new building society will now be allowed to make an advance not exceeding R20,000, or such a greater amount as the Registrar may approve, against security of a mortgage, before the end of its first financial year. There is no danger of the position degenerating, because the Act imposes several other restrictions on advances which adequately suppress the granting of large advances. For example, the Act provides that not more than 25 per cent of a society&#x2019;s total assets at the closure of its last preceding calendar quarter may be invested in mortgages which exceed R15,000.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill provides greater flexibility for the investment policy of these institutions. But I should like to point out to the hon. the Minister that as the Registrar has the say in so far as the investment policy is concerned cognizance should be given to the diversification which takes place among the financial institutions to-day. I read in the Press this morning of an insurance organization being taken over by one of the banks. When banks take over insurance companies or vice versa and there is diversification of similar institutions, the Registrar must be on this guard that investments in terms of the relative statute are not necessarily made in an institution of the same family. There is the risk that the security the public expects to be maintained would not be maintained as it is spread in the same organization. For example, if an insurance company is taken over by a bank and is required to invest certain of its securities in a bank as an investment and virtually the same directors have control, there is the danger that they may be prejudiced. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will bear that in mind when he says that the Registrar has control and will decide what investments are appropriate. There is the danger that when companies are associated the tendency is for one company to invest in another branch of the same organization and thereby to keep the interest investment in the same family. It does not necessarily follow that the public outside are to the same extent secured, because there can be a conflict of interests, particularly if they have the same boards. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will bear that in mind and will draw the attention of the Registrar to this matter.</p>

<p>I think that this Bill in general provides for greater flexibility. This Bill is also more realistic having regard to the changed circumstances. It allows for larger amounts to be invested by the private investor and that must be expected as over die years the value of money has gone down. One therefore has to save a larger amount to invest in a house or some other asset which requires in the first instance, the building up of building society funds and building society investments. This Bill takes into account the fact that bigger amounts are required to be saved and therefore the. amount the individual is allowed to have as his credit must, in consequence, be a larger amount. I suggest that the hon. the Deputy Minister should bring to the notice of the Registrar the importance of keeping the question of diversification continually in mind, because with the amalgamations and mergers taking place today. there can be a conflct of interests. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will bear this in mind when this Bill is considered.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that I appreciate the support the Opposition is according this measure. I would like to assure the hon. member for Pinetown that I will make a point of writing to the Registrar especially to bring the suggestions of the hon. member to his attention. I may, perhaps, just remind the hon. member that there was a technical committee appointed by the hon. the Minister of finance to enquire into the whole banking structure in <span class="col_1765-1766" refersTo="page_0897"/>South Africa in 1964. I believe it is the intention of the hon. the Minister to appoint another technical committee soon to go into the financial set-up of all these institutions. We will bear in mind what the hon. member said in this regard. With regard to the prescribed investments and the authority that is now under this Bill granted to the Registrar, I may point out that the Registrar had the same power under the Act which we are now changing. We are eliminating one difficulty we had, namely that the Registrar after he had approved a particular institution had no power over such an institution in so far as it could guarantee loans of other institutions. That is now being rectified and we are giving the specific authority to the Registrar to approve any loan for a prescribed investment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is an administrative measure and it gives effect to various departmental transfers and authorities. However, I should like to mention one matter in particular. That is the amendment to the Post Office Act, which-provides for the increase in the limit for Post Office Savings Bank accounts. The amount is raised from R4,000 to R10,000. This is a realistic amount in the-light of present day circumstances. I hope that, apart from providing a sum of R10,000 as the limit for the Post Office Savings Bank, the hon. the Minister will be able to give us some indication of the number of Post Office Savings Bank accounts which are at the limit of R4,000. One gets the general impression that the Post Office Savings Bank is used by the small man and the accounts seldom go to large figures. If it is proposed to have the limit as R10,000, I submit that the Post Office itself will have to do more publicity work and public relations work to attract the public. I suggest the time is long overdue for the adoption of a more realistic attitude towards the Post Office Savings Bank system. The Post Office Savings Bank could be used by the ordinary man in the street to a far greater extent than it is being used now if we had a more realistic approach to this Governmental department. One gets the impression that the Post Office Savings Department is a Cinderella department. It is mainly for the small income group. If the hon. the Minister wants to attract people to invest up to R10,000, I suggest that a more active effort on the part of the department concerned should be made. Under present circumstances the ordinary man who wants to invest up to R10,000, I am afraid, wants to invest in a far more energetic, modern and efficient saving system than the present Post Office Savings Bank system. We support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by my colleague the hon. member for Pine-town in regard to the Post Office Savings Bank. Savings Banks are a financial instrument which is of great value in the Western democratic countries. I really feel that we are not making sufficient use of that instrument in order to assist the small man. I therefore welcome this provision to increase the amount that can be deposited in the Savings Bank, but I do doubt very much whether it is going to be very effective. The obvious reason why it might not be as effective as the hon. the Minister hopes, is that an interest rate of only 4 per cent is being paid. I think it is one of the lowest interest rates which is being offered by any savings bank. I feel that the reconsideration of the Post Office Saving Bank&#x2019;s value should also involve the question of interest rates, even though it is free from income tax. After all, if we take into account that the value of money is declining by about 3 per dent per year, an interest rate of 4 pet cent is really not very impressive.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause gives further powers to the Railway Administration. The Railway Administration may now invest with such financial institutions outside the Republic as may be expressly approved by the Minister of Transport. First of all I should like to know which institutions outside the Republic are contemplated as investment media for the Railway Administration. Secondly I should like to know what <span class="col_1767-1768" refersTo="page_0898"/>control is to be exercised over the question of rates of interest, the security and otherwise regarding the advance or the loan which may be made. This appears to be left entirely to the discretion of the Minister of Transport. Surely, it is desirable that the Minister of finance should at least be brought into any investments of this sort which are made outside the boundaries of the Republic. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister can enlighten us whether it is contemplated to make loans through the Railway Administration to foreign countries or to foreign institutions. As I understand this legislation, this is not necessary in the case of South West Africa, but is it contemplated that we are now going to lend money via the Railway Administration, as apart from the Government, to a foreign country? Does this mean that they are now going to make advances to foreign countries? Why is such a measure put into the Bill? It must have been put into this Bill for a specific purpose, which is to cover some future investments, or has the Minister of Transport already made advances? I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to explain why this provision was included in this Bill.</p>

<p>It is not envisaged that the South African Railways will invest funds overseas in any way. But, as we all know, railway equipment is purchased overseas from time to time, sometimes in fairly large quantities. I happen to know that at present, just to mention one item, we have an order something like 90 diesel locomotives involving an amount of R12 million. Naturally, funds have to be sent to certain oversea countries in settlement of accounts from time to time, and it could just happen that funds lie idle in those countries for perhaps a week or a fortnight before they are actually paid over. Thus short-term money of the South African Railways could be lying idle overseas, and at present there is no legal provision to invest those moneys. Perhaps it will not happen, but in case such an eventuality should arise we are making provision here to invest the money and to earn interest. I think I can assure the Committee that the institutions approved of by the Minister of Transport will be approved of in consultation with the Minister of finance.</p>

<p>Can we have the assurance of the Deputy Minister that investments made for the purposes stated by him will not be long-term investments but only short-term investments? [Interjections.] Sir, it is all very well for hon. members to interject, but this clause that we have before us does not say whether the investments are short-or long-term investments. It gives the Minister the power to invest overseas or to invest outside the country. The hon. the Deputy Minister in his reply has told us that these investments are to be made for short terms of a week or a fortnight. I would like to have his assurance that these investments will only be short-term and not long-term investments.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not at all satisfied with the reply of the hon. the Deputy Minister. Is it suggested that the credit of South Africa when we place an order for locomotives is so bad that we have to pay cash with the order? I cannot believe that that is the position and I think the hon. the Deputy Minister owes us a somewhat clearer explanation and not cut conjecture that this power may be required. Surely, if the South African Railway Administration place an order with any country for locomotives we are not expected to make a cash deposit with the order? Surely, that is not expected of our Government, or is that what we have descended to? Because that is all that the hon. the Minister has suggested. I believe that we are entitled to a little more information from the hon. the Deputy Minister. Either he does not know the answer or there is another answer that we should have. I cannot believe for one moment that we must amend an Act to provide for a seven-day investment with some institution in Germany because we have to pay a deposit with the order when we order goods for South Africa.

We are doing business overseas like any other company or any other financial institution or organization in South Africa, and they all have this right to invest money there.

The hon. the Deputy Minister says that it may be necessary to have this power. Surely you do not come to Parliament to ask for something that you might need unless you know what you need it for. Sir, any importer of goods knows that there are usually three ways in which goods are paid for. The South African Railways purchase by tender; that tender lays down the conditions of payment. That payment can either be against shipment, on delivery, or split payments spread over a period after delivery. Before the order is placed the terms of payment are laid down. But no importer, unless he is a very bad businessman, is going to send money overseas to pay for something before he needs to pay for it. He will have a draft payable against shiping documents &#x2026;</p>

Sir, if that is the way in which our finances are being run, if that is the way in which the taxpayer&#x2019;s money is being spent, then it is high time there was a change. Why else do they ask for this power? The very fact that they are asking for this power is an admission that the taxpayer&#x2019;s money is being sent overseas before it is required to pay for what has been purchased. In other words, there is administrative inefficiency, and in order to deal with administrative inefficiency they need the power to make short-term investments. We are not satisfied that the hon. the Deputy Minister has given us the proper explanation of this power which he is asking for here.</p>

This is arranged by agreement. The hon. the Deputy Minister gave Louren&#x00E7;o Marques as the second example. He suggested that we might want to buy railway engines in Louren&#x00E7;o Marques. But is he not aware of <span class="col_1771-1772" refersTo="page_0900"/>the Mozambique Convention under which payments are regulated for imports through Mozambique to South Africa?

<summary>(Motion)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion, printed in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House in terms of section 52 of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964 (Act No. 91 of 1964), approves of the Customs Union Agreement entered into between the Government of the Republic of South Africa, the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Kingdom of Swaziland on 11th December, 1969, copies of which were laid upon the Table of the Senate on 18th February, 1970, and on that of the House of Assembly on 10th February, 1970.</block>

<p>As recently as 10th February, 1970 I laid copies of the Customs Union Agreement concerned in this motion upon the Table.</p>

<p>In 1910 a Customs Agreement was signed between South Africa and the three former High Commission Territories, namely Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland, which made provision for the free unrestricted interchange of goods between the four countries. After South Africa had left the Commonwealth in 1961, the Government decided to revise the trade relations with the three neighbouring states and to enter into negotiations with them in order to conclude a new agreement. These negotiations were initially conducted with the British Government, which acted on behalf of the three neighbouring states. After these three states had become independent direct negotiations with them were resumed. These negotiations ultimately lead to the concluding of a new agreement between the four countries which was signed on 11th December. 1969 in Pretoria and published on 12th December, 1969 in the <i>Gazette</i>. The new agreement, which now awaits ratification by this House, will come into operation on 3rd March, 1970.</p>

<p>The agreement is of course technically complicated. It contains quite a number of administrative or procedural instructions which do not constitute any principles of policy, but are only aimed at simplifying the administration.</p>

<p>I should therefore like to deal with the most important principles on which the agreement is based in order to give hon. members an insight into the basic objectives of the agreement. as well as the various arrangements to which the four parties agreed in order to realize these objectives. Let me explain in the first instance that the 1910 agreement has at present been in operation for almost 60 years and has with the passage of time laid a firm foundation for mutually beneficial economic co-operation between these four countries.</p>

<p>However, it must be borne in mind that during the past 60 years economic conditions in the four countries have changed considerably. In addition to that the constitutional position <span class="col_1773-1774" refersTo="page_0901"/>of the three neighbouring states has also undergone a fundamental change in this sense that it was only in relatively recent times that they obtained full sovereign independence. Concomitant with this change in their constitutional position a strong desire also arose in them to accelerate their economic development and therefore to negotiate under the new agreement arrangements with the Republic which would grant full recognition to their understandable aspirations in this regard.</p>

<p>In the light, of these facts the concluding of the new agreement which is based on the continuation of the present toll union between the four countries and which at the same time grants recognition to the changed circumstances and needs of each of these four countries must definitely be regarded as an important milestone in the Republic&#x2019;s relations with the three neighbouring states.</p>

<p>The most important provisions of the new agreement are those which give expression to the internationally accepted concepts of a Customs Union. These include the principle that there will be duty free interchange of domestically produced and imported goods without any quantitative restrictions in the common customs area of the four states. In addition it is being provided that the customs duty which applies from time to time in South Africa is also applicable to all goods imported from outside the common customs area.</p>

<p>At the same time it is being provided that the excise and sales duties which apply from time to time in the Republic will be levied to an equal extent in the neighbouring states on all goods which in our country are subject to duties of this kind, regardless of whether they are imported or domestically produced goods.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a desirable measure of flexibility in the application of uniform customs, excise and sales duties, in the customs area as a whole it is provided that adjustments to these duties can only be made after prior mutual consultation between the four countries, unless such adjustments are introduced for purely fiscal purposes. In this way for example, South Africa will have to consult in advance with the three neighbouring states in regard to the amendment of its fiscal structure, while any one of the three neighbouring states, after such prior consultation with the other members of the customs union, can levy duties for the promotion of its general economic development and particularly of its industrial development on goods produced in any one of the other states of the toll union, provided similar duties are also made applicable to goods originating in countries outside the customs union.</p>

<p>These provisions in the agreement represented two important exceptions to the general principles of a duty free interchanrge of domestically produced goods as well as the maintenance of uniform outside tariffs which form the basis of the customs union arrangement among the four countries.</p>

<p>Another important principle of the new agreement is the provision which grants any one of the member states the right, if specific goods are imported in such quantities and under such circumstances from another member state in its area that these imports constitute a threat for its own producers or manufacturers of similar or directly competitive products to request the member state from which the goods concerned are being imported, to consult with it at the earliest opportunity and to co-operate with it in order to find a mutually acceptable solution to the problems which such imports are causing.</p>

<p>In addition to this the agreement also contained instructions in regard to the regulation of the marketing of agricultural products. What these instructions amount to in short is that any arrangements of this nature which have been introduced in one of the member states can also be applied by the latter on an equitable basis to its imports of the agricultural products concerned from the three other neighbouring states.</p>

<p>In addition the new agreement provides for the co-ordination of the steps taken by the four states in regard to the application of import restrictions. The understanding in this case is once again that the member states will, with the application of such restrictions, consult one another in order to ensure that the object which the restrictions are seeking to achieve, will be achieved. What the provisions of the agreement amount to in essence is that the parties will co-operate in order to ensure the effectiveness of import restrictions which have been introduced in the Republic for economic reasons.</p>

<p>The new agreement also maintains the principle of the distribution from the joint pool of revenue obtained from the levying of customs, excise and sales duties in the customs union as a whole. The basis of this distribution of revenue, however, differs from that which is applicable in terms of the present agreement. In short, the common revenue under the new agreement is distributed on a basis of the extent of the imports of each of the three enighbouring states in contrast with the fixed percentage of the revenue which each of them receives in terms of the present agreement. The basis of the distribution of the revenue for which provision is made in the new agreement is regarded as being a more equitable formula than the present because the fixed percentages which the three states have up to now received from the common revenue pool was not related in any way to the fluctuating scope of their total imports. The altered basis of distribution of the common revenue will result in each of the three neighbouring states receiving a greater share from the common revenue of the customs union as a whole than has been the case up to now. The altered circumstances which apply at present in comparison with those of 1910, justify this benefit which will accrue to the states concerned in terms of the new agreement.</p>

<p>Owing to the exceptionally long period of <span class="col_1775-1776" refersTo="page_0902"/>time taken up by the negotiations, as well as the fact that the set-up of the common revenue pool was changed last year by the introduction of sales duty in the Republic, it is being provided that the new formula for the distribution of the revenue pool will be applied with retrospective effect as from 1st April, 1969.</p>

<p>The new agreement also contains provisions in regard to the transportation of goods within the joint customs area and the through passage of goods from one member of the customs union through the territory of another. In general outline these provisions are aimed at ensuring the unrestricted passage of imported goods through the territory of one member state to that of another, but with an adequate degree of freedom for the member states to protect their own security when granting such through passage facilities.</p>

<p>Provision is also being made for the appointment of a customs union commission, consisting of representatives of all the parties, for the purpose of discussing any matter which may arise out of the agreement. This Commission will meet once a year, but any contracting parties are at liberty at any time to request a meeting of the Commission in order to discuss any matters in regard to the agreement.</p>

<p>The new customs union agreement with our three neighbouring states is of historical significance in this sense that it is the first customs union agreement which has been concluded between the Republic and another group of independent African states. The signing thereof serves merely to confirm the Government&#x2019;s traditional standpoint that there is adequate scope for the peaceful co-existence of peoples and nations, regardless of differences in their political convictions and ideologies. As I have already stated previously in this House and elsewhere the Government is openly convinced that as far as trade relations between countries are concerned, the existence of political and other differences need not form any stumbling blocks in the road of mutually beneficial cooperation between them.</p>

<p>Then I should like to add that the agreement was concluded on a basis which envisages the promotion of the economic development of the members of the customs union as a whole and in particular to ensure that the development of the lesser developed members of the customs union as well as the diversification of the economy of each, will be accelerated. In this sense the signing of the new treaty is a significant event for the future economic welfare and stability of these four countries.</p>

<p>I move that the agreement be ratified.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>We support this motion. However, there are one or two matters on which I should like some information from the hon. the Minister. The Minister said that this was a Customs Union which had been in existence since 1910, and over the years we have seen the development of the Native territories of Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland from pastoral countries, or agricultural countries, to, in some cases, semi-industrial countries, and it is with this industrial development that I am concerned. The Minister will see from article 6 of this agreement, which has already been signed by the countries concerned, that it provides for the imposition of additional duties for protective purposes by Botswana, Lesotho or Swaziland, and then article 7 of the customs agreement provides for a specification of industries of major importance to Botswana, Lesotho or Swaziland. It says that the Government of Botswana, Lesotho or Swaziland may with the concurrence of the other contracting parties (a) specify industries which are or are likely to be of major importance to its economy, and (b) specify periods in relation to such industries for purposes of paragraph 2 of this article. Now, paragraph 2 says that &#x201C;the customs duties applicable to goods imported from outside the common customs area and competing with those of any industry specified in terms of this article, shall not for the period specified in terms of paragraph 1&#x201D;, etc&#x2026;. Sir, what I should like to know is, what criteria does the Minister intend to apply to these industries which are established in neighbouring territories? A certain amount of interest has been shown by overseas countries who have decided to invest in Africa. After seeing conditions in South Africa, they have found that we lay down certain minimum standards in factories, minimum standards for wages, working conditions, etc. Does the Minister take into account the standards which may be laid down in the neighbouring territories? If lower standards obtain in those countries and their industries are protected as well, there is a danger that the products of those industries can affect similar industries in South Africa, because there is no border customs control.</p>

<p>Industries which may otherwise have established themselves in South Africa, may, with overseas capital, now establish themselves in one of those other countries which are members of the Customs Union instead. They can then build up an industrial structure there, and look to South Africa as a market for their products, which can then compete with the products of South African industries. I should like to know from the Minister to what extent that was borne in mind when articles 6 and 7 were discussed. We find that since this agreement was first established in 1910, a further problem has arisen. When this agreement was first established, customs and excise had to be taken into account. Now, with the introduction of sales tax, a further problem has been added. Sales tax in South Africa has to be taken into consideration in arriving at the formula for the distribution of customs, excise and sales tax revenue to be shared by the contracting parties. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he sees a longterm continuation of this Customs Union. I am quite sure that we would all like to see it continued. We should, however, like at least the same conditions to apply to the industries which will be established in the neighbouring <span class="col_1777-1778" refersTo="page_0903"/>territories, as those which obtain in South Africa, otherwise there is the danger that industries which could not be established in South Africa will in fact be established in the neighbouring territories. Such industries in the neighbouring territories could, when they have developed to a certain stage, compete with those of South African manufacturers. I am quite sure that that would not be in the best interests of the industrialists of South Africa. I should like to know whether the Minister can give us some clarity in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am in fact astonished at the question and the standpoint of the hon. member for Pinetown. What he is in fact asking for amounts to an interference, on the part of this Government, in certain domestic matters of another independent Government. Just imagine, Sir, what would happen if agreements were to be entered into with a country like America, or with a country like Rhodesia, and South Africa were to lay down conditions and rules for minimum standards which those specific countries had to maintain. That is what this hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint amounts to. The hon. member stated that it could otherwise mean that lower standards could be applied in those countries.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>That is what the hon. member said. The hon. member said that it would then mean that there would be unfair competition for the factories in South Africa. In no trade agreement, with no country in the world, are such arrangements being made. We must accept that countries like Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland are countries which are still relatively undeveloped. If we require the same standards in those countries, which in principle we cannot and will not do, those industries would be placed under burdens which would not suit their local conditions. Surely we cannot do this. If we were to do this, we would be closing down those factories before they began.</p>

<p>What is more, Sir, perhaps the hon. member did not read that when such specific duties are requested by one of those three countries, they remain in force for eight years. After eight years South Africa must agree to it. This is a fair agreement. The hon. member cannot on the one hand plead for co-operation with African states&#x2014;which we regard as of vital importance for our own country and the survival of our white civilization&#x2014;and on the other hand advocate measures which would amount to those good relations being marred. I can think of no better way of causing this agreement to fail than to insist that certain minimum standards, more or less such as those in South Africa, should be laid down in the factories in those countries concerned. They cannot agree to that. You know yourself, Sir, that in a remote place, even in South Africa, we cannot always lay down the same conditions as, for example, in a large city like Johannes burg. The measures in a large city will inevitably have to be stricter. I am sorry to say that the hon. member either does not understand the circumstances, or it amounts to his proposal doing harm to the good relations between the various countries.</p>

<p>One of the most important means of building good relations between states, are economic means. This is one bridge on which many people can walk without standing in one another&#x2019;s way, because that bridge is built to the benefit of all the countries concerned. Here we have for the first time, as the hon. the Minister said, entered into an agreement with independent neighbouring states. This is not an agreement with Great Britain as in 1910 when they were still under the control of that country. This agreement was entered into with independent states on our borders. This is an agreement which has been entered into in a very good spirit. This is also an agreement which is to the benefit of South Africa and also to the benefit of those countries concerned. It is therefore an agreement which lays the foundation for the building of sound economic relations, which in their turn lay the foundation for the building of good political relations. When we enter into such an agreement it is obvious that we must give and take. If we simply want to take and do not want to give, we can reach no agreement. That is the spirit in which this agreement was concluded. I am certain that, if the hon. member ponders this, he will realize that the request he made on the Minister can be expected of neither South Africa nor those countries. It is not in accordance with the general practice, in fact, it is the direct opposite. I want to express the hope that hon. members on that side, who also believe in good co-operation with other countries, and particularly with countries near our borders, will make their contribution in that spirit in order to build and to strengthen the good relations between our countries. I want to conclude by saying that I should like to extend my sincere congratulations to the hon. the Minister and his department on an agreement between four countries which may not perhaps seem so important on paper, but which will in the years which lie ahead show itself to be one of the best means of making those good relations ever stronger.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I in turn am astonished at the action of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, he who is the chairman of the financial group of that party. The hon. member for Pinetown put certain questions to the hon. the Minister. The questions were simple enough. In this agreement dealing with excise and import duties, which stretches over a period of years, is it being ensured that, if a surplus of material should come in here as a result of the development of those states, it should be imported in unlimited quantities at fixed customs and excise tariffs? Now he is asking whether there is any kind of protection for our own industries. The hon. member who has just spoken, <span class="col_1779-1780" refersTo="page_0904"/>in his capacity as a businessman is very well acquainted with this. He enjoys good protection for the items he produces in this country, but this is not in terms of this excise agreement. Now the hon. member puts this question to the hon. the Minister. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, what that hon. member uses as an example? He speaks of a trade agreement with the U.S.A., which we do not have in any case. I wish we did have one. A trade agreement with the U.S.A. has no bearing whatsoever on these customs and excise arrangements with neighbouring states. Now I ask you, Sir, whether one can make a comparison like this?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I did not interrupt that hon. member when he was speaking. The hon. member himself knows what relations we have with Rhodesia. Our relations with Rhodesia are entirely different to the other example he used. The Lord knows we have too few trade agreements, and this is no trade agreement either. This has nothing to do with the trade agreement. It is an agreement in regard to customs and excise duties with ad joining states. It is nothing more and nothing less than that. The hon. member for Pinetown asked the hon. the Minister courteously whether arrangements were being made for a long-term agreement in regard to customs and excise duties &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. members referred to agricultural and industrial products. The fact of the matter is that this agreement has existed since 1910. Agricultural products were being produced at the time; and there were also industrial goods. These goods entered the country and were marketed here. Therefore no new problem is being created here. In these negotiations provision also had to be made for the fact that these young areas would also like to see their own industrial development take place. They also want sources of employment for their people and provision is being made for industries to be able to arise in those areas. The hon. member for Pinetown asked what provision we are making to ensure that there are no other conditions of employment, wage laws, and so on, which apply there. That is what he asked for by implication. The fact remains that we cannot interfere in their domestic affairs. We cannot interfere in their labour legislation. That is a matter which they must regulate themselves. Within the freedom they have, we must determine what our relations with them should be. This is also provided for in this agreement. It is very clear to me that the hon. member for East London (City) never even looked at this agreement, for article 12 provides what should happen with agricultural goods as far as joint marketing is concerned. It also provides what should be done when marketing arrangements are such that care has to be taken that agricultural products from those areas do not cause disruption for those from our agriculture. As far as industrial goods are concerned, there is also provision to the effect that industries may arise in those areas, but it is most certainly not our duty to prevent this. That is why article 17 provides the following in so far as industrial goods are concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the provisions of article 2, if, as a result of unforeseen development, any product is being introduced into the area of one of the contracting parties from the area of another contracting party in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to producers or manufacturers of like or directly competitive products in the area into which such goods are so introduced, the Government of the latter area shall have the right to require the other party to consult at the earliest possible opportunity and to co-operate with it in finding as soon as possible a mutually acceptable solution.</block>

<p>Both in that article and in article 20 provision is therefore being made for an advisory body which must meet at least once a year to iron out these problems. Provision is therefore being made for the problems foresen by hon. members. I think that this is the most equitable agreement in which recognition can also be given to their right to produce and to develop their own agriculture and their industry. If the production of one party, whether agricultural or industrial, has a prejudicial effect on that of another party, this provision for thorough consultation exists.</p>

<heading>BANTU HOMELANDS CITIZENSHIP BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>I sincerely believe that this Bill will be a most important milestone along the road of building nations in the Republic of South <span class="col_1781-1782" refersTo="page_0905"/>Africa and that it will add lustre to our history. I regard it as an exceptional privilege to be in the position to introduce this measure here. I have been giving serious thought to this important matter for a considerable time, but some difficulties cropped up. Fortunately we have made such progress with the establishment and development of the various Bantu nations in our country that we can now give our positive attention to the distinctive citizenship of each of these nations.</p>

<p>It is with pride that I want to point out that this Bill, like a few others, is one of the most fundamendal measures ever to come before this House in the Government&#x2019;s extensive task of implementing, in respect of the Bantu nations, our country&#x2019;s policy of separate development&#x2014;which I have often in the past termed multi-national development. The Bill is concise and clear&#x2014;yes, self-explanatory, but I have nevertheless deemed it necessary to lay an explanatory memorandum on the Table. I shall, in the course of my speech, endeavour to furnish such explanations as are necessary.</p>

<p>It is necessary to point out that I use the word &#x201C;volk&#x201D; in Afrikaans in this Bill and in my speech in its ordinary meaning, which is nearly the same as &#x201C;national unit&#x201D;, the term used in the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act (Act No. 46 of 1959). In English an equally suitable word is not available, so that, as in the Development of Self-Government for Native Nations in South West Africa Act (Act No. 54 of 1968), I have to use the word &#x201C;nation&#x201D;, which also means about the same as &#x201C;national unit&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I should like you to view this measure primarily as a building stone&#x2014;and a corner-stone at that&#x2014;in the process of the development of nations in which we are engaged. I am endeavouring to execute my taxing, yet pleasant, task in a systematic way and according to a considered pattern. That is why I want to remind members of my declaration of purpose here in your midst after I became Minister when I stated on 13th October, 1966, that I regarded it as my task to help to establish the number of Bantu nations in South Africa as separate distinctive nations and to assist them in their development into proud national and spiritual havens for the members of those nations, no matter how dispersed they were. This measure will be an indispensable instrument for the promotion of this service of building nations. In our country we have a multiplicity of nations that have to work out their own salvation here at the southernmost point of Africa. We grant one another a right of existence, each within his own circle, where each nation can and will realize itself to the highest degree. This, then, also forms the basis of our policy of separate development. We are not trying to oust or oppress one another On the contrary, we are making mutual contributions to one another&#x2019;s development according to the individual nature, traditions and abilities of each. Our concept of nations is not based on difference in colour, but on the essential differences in nature. All human beings of the same colour, of course, do not necessarily belong to one nation. Therefore the white population of Western Europe consists of a number of nations and similarly the black population of Africa also consists of many nations.</p>

<p>For far too long a time and from far too early a stage two major errors were made: In the first instance we acted as if all the Bantu and white persons (and even the Indians and the Coloureds) in South Africa represented one actual or potential human unit and, secondly, an error was made in regarding all the Bantu persons in South Africa as one compact human unit, or nation for that matter. Not only did the conspicuous heterogeneity of the groups in the South African population escape the attention to a certain extent of most ordinary people, but unfortunately it was for years not taken into proper consideration by our legislators and national administration. Striking proof of these twofold and partially overlapping errors is to toe found in a number of laws and in administrative usages.</p>

<p>Fortunately it is being realized to an ever increasing extent that the Bantu population in South Africa consists of various nations, and is not one heterogeneous national community. These nations differ so much from one another that, as far as language usage is concerned, they mostly cannot understand one another. In addition their cultures, in the broadest sense of the word, are not nearly identical. I want it to be throughly understood that we do not have only one Bantu nation in South Africa, but various Bantu nations.</p>

<p>Each one of these Bantu ethnic units is a separate nation which is proud of its own identity. And it is in order to bring about and to stabilize this identification process that this measure is being introduced to-day. We are in this way granting recognition to individual citizenship for each national unit so as to nurture the slumbering national pride, and in this way to develop the spiritual and cultural assets of that national unit within a distinctive national milieu and to help develop a healthy self-respect and national pride.</p>

<p>This Bill is another of the consistent steps of this Government to carry into effect the fundamental task which it took upon itself before 1948 with the public as witness. Along with other measures on the Statute Book and all the developing activities of the Government, this measure complies with the following basic tenet, as contained in the 1948 Manifesto of the National Party. I quote: &#x201C;The Native Reserve must become the true fatherland of the Native.&#x201D;</p>

<p>This Bill will therefore contribute a great deal towards simulating among the members of each Bantu nation a feeling of national unity and national culture. And what is very important, the measure will enable the so-called urbanized Bantu person to find a home for his political aspirations with the people to <span class="col_1783-1784" refersTo="page_0906"/>whom he belongs. Too easily do superficial thinkers and opponents of our policy say that the Bantu individuals in the white areas have become detribalized and alienated from their specific groups. What they do not realize and what such sceptics do not want to take cognizance of, is that the Bantu persons in the white areas invariably retain their ethnic ties, i.e. they feel an attachment to their specific peoples and homelands, particularly as a result of all kinds of ties such as, <i>inter alia</i>, their origin, descent, relationships, material interests, folklore, tribal connections, history and &#x2014;strongest of all&#x2014;language. Therefore citizenship, which everywhere is a strong tie binding people to their nation and country, will now be and become a unifying factor for the Bantu nations as well, and it is therefore, by virtue of this measure, becoming for every Bantu person in South Africa a reality which will be regulated by statute, whereas hitherto it has been a vague uncertainty.</p>

<p>This Bill therefore reinforces the basis upon which also the political aspect of our policy rests in respect of the Bantu in the white area: that they belong to their own specific nations and that they cannot integrate with the Whites into one nation. Within their own context, and linked to the homelands of their specific nations, they will enjoy their political fulfilment, which will include a form of franchise. As soon as this Bill takes effect, that aspect of the activation of Bantu authorities can be dealt with systematically. As a matter of fact, the North Sotho have already expressed the desire to have their people in the white area politically associated with their homeland authorities.</p>

<p>I should like to go back a little way in our history, particularly in order to recall briefly how the Government has, since it assumed Office in 1948, placed various measures on the Statute Book to assist the Bantu nations in their respective homelands in their process of development, and in particular to state clearly that we do not regard ourselves as a dominating population group in South Africa, claiming autocracy over other nations here.</p>

<p>I repeat, in this context, what I have said several times before, that the political system of our Government is not a system by means of which the Whites as a minority nation are governing over one or more nations which together outnumber the Whites. Our policy has produced a system of a national government for each nation over itself. Of course, we&#x2014;i.e. the white Government of the Republic&#x2014;are helping those nations which are not yet able to proceed on their own. We also regard this as our bounden duty. Hon. members know how our policy grants recognition to Bantu homelands as well as to the homeland of the Whites, and how the Bantu in their homelands need not compete with nor fear the Whites. There the Whites are temporary helpers as long as the Bantu require their services. On the other hand, the Bantu, according to our policy, are also present in the white homelands in a casual capacity because and as long as their labour is required here.</p>

<p>To prove our sincerity in this regard, I should like to refer you to the most important of a series of laws which we have passed since 1948. To begin with, I mention the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, which made provision for the establishment in the homelands of Bantu authorities, which are the embryo for the future parliamentary form of government. Tribal rule has been recognized through the tribal authorities, which can, in addition function on a regional basis as regional authorities. The highest form of this administrative hierarchy is territorial authorities, the nucleus of the future central authority of the Bantu nation concerned. The powers, functions and duties of these territorial authorities are set out in section 7 of the said Act, and I hope hon. members will look it up again. These authorities have grown everywhere, and this year we have seen, as we did last year, how they are all developing in their own distinctive manner towards the acceptance of greater responsibilities.</p>

<p>Another Act I mention to hon. members is the Bantu Education Act (No. 47 of 1953). This Act effected the transfer of the administration of and control over Bantu education from the various provinces to the State authority and in this way it became possible to involve the Bantu authorities to an increasing extent in the schools, and they are therefore also being trained in this branch of the process of national development, which they never found possible before.</p>

<p>In 1959 we took another great stride forward when the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act (No. 46 of 1959) was placed on the Statute Book to make provision for the gradual development of self-governing Bantu national units, which were identified in that Act. In the preamble to this Act the fundamental principles of our policy are clearly set out&#x2014;and I am repeating them here, because they are equally important for the purposes of this Bill:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Whereas the Bantu peoples of the Union of South Africa do not constitute a homogeneous people; but form separate national units on the basis of language and culture;</block>

<block name="quote">and whereas it is desirable for the welfare and progress of the said peoples to afford recognition to the various national units and to provide for their gradual development within their own areas to self-governing units on the basis of Bantu systems of government;</block>

<block name="quote">and whereas it is therefore expedient to develop and extend the Bantu system of government for which provision has been made in the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, with due regard to prevailing requirements &#x2026; &#x201D;, etc.</block>

<p><span class="col_1785-1786" refersTo="page_0907"/>Then followed the Transkei Constitution Act, 1963. Still based on the Bantu authorities system, that measure granted further powers of self-government to the former Transkeian Territorial Authority&#x2014;particularly since, as is stated in the preamble to that Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;&#x2026; the policy of separate development envisages the gradual development of self-governing Bantu national units in the traditional Bantu homelands.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Hon. members probably still remember how in 1968 we passed the Development of Self-Goverment for Native Nations in South West Africa Act (No. 54 of 1968), an Act which has already resulted in the establishment of the Legislative Council for Ovamboland.</p>

<p>Upon thorough reflection you will realize that this Bill, and the aforementioned Acts, also link up with two important old Acts establishing the Bantu areas in South Africa, namely the Bantu Land Act (No. 27 of 1913) and the Bantu Trust and Land Act (No. 18 of 1936).</p>

<p>Since I am dealing with the political development of the homelands and of the Bantu nations, I must, for the sake of completeness, point out that we did not content ourselves with their political development, but that we are also planning and making provision for their economic development. For that reason we established the Bantu Corporations, and the Promotion of the Economic Development of Bantu Homelands Act, 1968 (No. 46 of 1968), makes provision for the promotion of the economic development of the Bantu homelands and their peoples.</p>

<p>In addition there are related Acts such as the Bantu Labour Act and the resultant Bantu Labour Regulations (Bantu Homelands) (Proclamation R74/1968), in terms of which labour bureaux have been established in the homelands under the Bantu authorities, at which bureaux work-seekers are registered, work is offered and contracts for work in white areas are concluded.</p>

<p>It is against this background that I should like this House to consider the measure which is now under discussion. By means of this Bill I wish to establish its own citizenship for each Bantu nation, thereby promoting its further development. As, with the exception of the Transkei, the highest form of government is, at the moment still that of a Territorial Authority, the citizenship is at this stage that of a Territorial Authority Area, but as any particular nation progresses towards greater independence, the citizenship of that nation can and will broaden in scope. (I am not referring to the Ovamboland Legislative Assembly now, because the measure now before us will not be applicable in South West Africa, as the Development of Self-Government for Native Nations in South West Africa Act (No. 54 of 1968) makes the necessary provisions.)</p>

<p>I do not apologize for the fact that in respect of the Bantu nations each will, in terms of this Bill, initially have incomplete citizenship. Many examples can be given of how citizenship can be an evolutionary process. All of us should therefore realize that in this Bill a system of evolutionary citizenship is being introduced.</p>

<p>I am fully aware that to some people this concept of citizenship will seem dubious and foreign because, according to them, it applies only to part of the country. Such persons apparently do not fully realize that we are engaged in an evolutionary process of establishing Bantu nations and of gradually forming individual countries for each.</p>

<p>I wish to repeat these words clearly, so that everyone can take them in and so that they will sink deeply into the minds of all. Such sceptical persons apparently do not fully realize that we are engaged in an evolutionary process of establishing Bantu nations and of gradually forming individual countries for each. If this establishment of nations and formation of their countries could be achieved at once, many problems would disappear, but these tasks require indefinite time and therefore we encounter problems, caused by incomplete differentiation in respect of budding nations for developing countries. [Interjections.] Unfortunately this differentiation is too easily and erroneously called discrimination. The hon. member is trying to put me off. He is probably just waking up. Unfortunately this differentiation is too easily and erroneously called discrimination.</p>

<p>However, this House gave this matter of citizenship serious consideration when the Transkei Constitution Act was being discussed in 1963, because in section 7 of that Act a Transkeian citizenship was established. Hon. members will note, too, that the definition of that citizenship has to a large extent been followed in the measure at present before us. The Transkei Constitution Act establishes the precedent of citizenship for a specific group, and therefore we cannot possibly withhold it in the case of the other groups or nations which are also on the road to self-government. After all, there is merely a difference of degree between the form of government of the Transkei and those of the other homelands. There is therefore, in my opinion, no justification whatsoever for withholding citizenship from the other nations outside the Transkei. It is an essential component in the process of nation-building, and I am very pleased that we can clinch the matter now. In this way it will be possible to identify all our Bantu nations so that each nation will be able to know precisely where it stands.</p>

<p>At the time of the debate on the Transkei Constitution Act, a very interesting article, signed J.F.H., appeared in the <i>Journal of Contemporary Roman-Dutch Law</i> (1963, Volume 26. page 44) under the heading &#x201C;A Transkeian Citizen of South African Nationality&#x201D;, and I recommend this to honourable members. In this article the writer deals with Transkeian citizenship, measured against international law, and he arrives at the following conclusion, which I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1787-1788" refersTo="page_0908"/>So, judging from these precedents a future Transkeian Government may well be recognized by International Law as being capable of exercising functions of sovereignty which in its residual substance may remain with the Republic.</block>

<p>He distinguishes between &#x201C;citizenship&#x201D; (burgerskap) and &#x201C;nationality&#x201D; (staatsburgerskap), and I think that everything he had to say in the article in regard to the Transkei, can be said with equal justification in respect of Territorial Authorities in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>The certificate of citizenship referred to in the Bill is a purely consequential phenomenon &#x2014;merely proof of specific nationality. Citizenship is acquired by means of the Act itself.</p>

<p>These certificates&#x2014;and the identification of all Bantu persons as citizens of specific homelands&#x2014;will, apart from the positive value thereof, as set out in the Act, and as already indicated, play a key role to an increasing extent in the further development of our policy of separate development. I have already pointed out here, and elsewhere, that our co-existence in South Africa will ever increasingly become one of inter-nation relations. This Bill can play a very important part in those relations.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with the clauses in more detail. Clause 2 is the key clause. Every indigenous Bantu person, including those born or domiciled outside the homelands, becomes in terms of this measure a citizen of some or other Territorial Authority or of the Transkei. (It has been deemed desirable also to refer to &#x201C;self-governing Bantu territories&#x201D; in the Bill&#x2014; although, apart from the Transkei. there are at present none such&#x2014;because the Transkei Constitution Act uses this expression repeatedly.)</p>

<p>Just as in the case of the Transkei, a positive value is attached to citizenship, viz. franchise which may be exercised in respect of the area in question, apart from other privileges, duties, obligations and responsibilities which such citizenship may entail. I should like the Bantu of South Africa to realize clearly that this Bill provides&#x2014;and that our Government will abide thereby&#x2014;that such a homeland citizen will not be regarded as a foreigner in the Republic outside his own homeland, and will be regarded as a South African citizen for purposes of foreign relations and protection. The Republic can also at any time, by way of legislation or administratively, grant all kinds of privileges to the citizens of Bantu homelands, such as opportunities for employment, residence and visits in the white homeland.</p>

<p>Clause 3 defines the Bantu persons who can acquire citizenship, namely, firstly, Bantu born in the area concerned; secondly, Bantu domiciled in that area; thirdly, Bantu speaking the Bantu language of that area or belonging to any associated linguistic group which uses any dialect of that language; and fourthly, any other Bantu person related to any member of the Bantu population of that area or who has identified himself with any part of such population or who is associated with any part of such population by virtue of his cultural or racial background. This definition largely follows the definition of Transkeian citizenship. All indigenous Bantu groups are included in this.</p>

<p>Clause 4 deals with the loss of this citizenship. As in the case of the Transkei, citizenship of a Bantu homeland is lost if the Bantu person concerned becomes a citizen of another Territorial Authority Area or of the Transkei, or becomes a national of another state. However, he always remains a citizen of some Bantu homeland or other as long as he is a South African citizen.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with certificates of citizenship. Every Bantu person who is a citizen of a Bantu homeland can acquire a certificate of citizenship, issued by or on behalf of a Territorial Authority or on behalf of the Transkei. If a Bantu homeland, including the Transkei, should therefore request the Republican Government to issue certificates on its behalf, this can be done and my department will undertake to do so.</p>

<p>Clauses 6 and 7 deal with the issue of these certificates, and are so self-explanatory that I really need not elaborate on them.</p>

<p>Clause 8 lavs down that photographs will be necessary. The Government does not want the issue of certificates to be hampered simply because the Bantu persons concerned are not prepared to provide photographs. If therefore they do not want to or cannot provide photographs, the department will make the necessary arrangements. However, because the Bantu will have a personal pride in the document and it can acquire status value, it is anticipated that many Bantu persons will make their own arrangements for the necessary photographs&#x2014;a procedure which will in fact be encouraged by us.</p>

<p>Clause 9 deals with objections and appeals. Provision is made in this clause for objections by either the Bantu themselves or the Territorial Authority concerned to certificates which have been issued. These objections are then heard by an Officer designated by the Minister. It is possible to appeal against that Officer&#x2019;s decision to the Minister, whose decision is final.</p>

<p>Clause 10 relates to offences and penal provisions and lays down various offences, and is aimed at forgeries (and the confiscation of forged documents) or misleading representations. The mere fact that a Bantu person is not in possession of a certificate of citizenship will not. in terms of this Bill, constitute a punishable offence. In fact, the measure does not even make provision for certificates being demanded.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 11 a variety of regulations can be promulgated to facilitate and expedite the issue of the certificates. In fact, it is deemed desirable to prescribe by regulation <span class="col_1789-1790" refersTo="page_0909"/>as much as possible of the procedural side of this matter.</p>

<p>In regard to clauses 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, which deal with consequential amendments, it is necessary to note that a Bantu person must still be in possession of a reference book, in which his identification details will appear. There is therefore no reason why a Bantu person will of necessity have to produce his certificate of citizenship for influx control purposes&#x2014;i.e. for residence in urban areas. Since the certificate has not been made statutorily demandable, a higher premium is being placed on these documents, which will greatly contribute towards directly linking every Bantu person in the Republic with a specific Bantu homeland. However, the value of the document will rapidly become apparent to the Bantu community, just as in the case of our own identity cards, in that it will be possible to produce the certificate for obtaining everything which entails benefits. Here I have in mind matters such as voters&#x2019; rolls, old age and disability allowances, unemployment insurance, employment privileges, etc. The Bantu Reference Bureau will maintain records of details concerning certificates of citizenship which have been issued.</p>

<p>I may mention that the initial draft Bill, which embodied the same principles as this one, was discussed with the Executive Committees of the various Territorial Authorities, and they all accepted it with enthusiasm. The Transkeian Cabinet was consulted in regard to the Bill in its present form, and expressed its satisfaction with it.</p>

<p>With this explanation then, Mr. Speaker, I hopefully look forward to an interesting and constructive discussion of this Bill.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude with two fundamental questions. Firstly: Is it really asking too much, when I now make an appeal to the members of this House to accept, also in this case, as has in fact been happening throughout the world, the differentiation among the various nations, and to help to perfect this measure, which seeks to regulate the differentiation among the Bantu nations? This is my first question. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon which is manifested throughout the world. I am asking it here too for our Bantu nations in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to ask a second question as well. If we can all co-operate in doing this here, will our actions not be a forcible demonstration to the entire world that we in South Africa are not so much contending with a race problem, but that we are seriously engaged in a task of building nations, a task of building nations, as apposed to a race problem?</p>

<p>He read with pride the history of development of the Bantu nations as he called them, and of the progress they have made by Acts which have been passed by this Government. He ended up with the Transkeian Constitution. But do we remember how the Transkeian Constitution came about? Do we remember what Dr. Verwoerd said when he announced in this House that independence is to be given to the reserves? Do we remember that he said that it is not something he wanted? Do we remember that he said: &#x201C;Dit is &#x2019;n verbrokkeling wa ons nie graag wil h&#x00EA; nie,&#x201D; but we are being forced by the outside world to do it? Do they remember that? It was not something he was proud of, it was something he apologized for. He apologized for that and he gave his reasons. Do we remember that when the late Dr. Verwoerd originally became Minister of Bantu Affairs, he started talking about separate development, about this complete separation, about &#x201C;algehele apartheid&#x201D;? The older members like the Chief Whip will remember that when we tackled Dr. Malan about it and asked him whether that was his policy, he said that it was an ideal but not practical politics. We have been listening to unattainable idealism from the hon. the Minister. We have to get down to practical politics. The hon. the Minister says we have an example in what has been done to the Transkei. There separate citizenship was <span class="col_1791-1792" refersTo="page_0910"/>given to the Africans in the Transkei. He quotes a Dutch authority.

<p>Because one professor writes a legal article, it does not mean to say that that is international law. Does the hon. the Minister think that if the Transkei applied to become a member of the United Nations Organization, it will be accepted? Of course it would not be accepted.</p>

<p>This Bill is quite simple in its intention but certainly not so simple in its implications. It purports merely to give, as the Minister said, citizenship in a self-governing territory or territorial authority to every African in South Africa. It also provides for the issue to citizens of certificates of citizenship. It is not obligatory on every Bantu to apply for a certificate of citizenship; he is merely entitled to apply for one. Whether he applies for a certificate or not, he automatically will become a citizen of a Bantu homeland. In terms of Clause 3, he shall become a citizen. Therefore, whether he applies or not, willy-nilly he becomes a citizen of a homeland. He will be the only South African citizen who is entitled to a certificate, except those citizens who become naturalized. No other South African gets a certificate, but the Bantu will be given one. Whether he wants it or not he will be given citizenship of a homeland, irrespective of whether he resides or works in the homeland, and irrespective of whether he was born in the homeland or not. He gets this certificate, irrespective of whether the homeland wants him or not. This will happen because the hon. the Minister will have the final say. How will this African be any better off with this new citizenship? What will the citizenship mean to him? What will he get? He will get the franchise in a homeland in which he may have no interest at all. He will enjoy all the rights, privileges and benefits and be subject to all the duties, obligations and responsibilities of citizenship of the territorial authority which are accorded to or imposed upon him by law. It may mean something for the African who lives in the homeland and who is allowed to hire or own a piece of land in the homeland. It will mean that he will not lose the right which he already has. He will not gain any new right, but he will keep the right which he already has. What else will it mean to him? It will not give him a better home life or more security. It will not give him a right which he does not enjoy at present. However, it may subject him to more obligations; it may, for example, subject him to paying a tax which is levied upon him by the self-governing homeland, irrespective of whether he lives there or not. This can be done in the Transkei at present. The hon. the Minister cannot deny that. In terms of the Transkeian Constitution the Transkei Government has the power to tax its citizens no matter where they live. Irrespective of whether or not he lives in his homeland he may be obliged to pay taxes there. Until the homelands become viable sovereign independent states the citizenship being offered to the Bantu now is quite meaningless. It is meaningless because until his homeland becomes independent he will still be subject to all the obligations and responsibilities of a South African citizen. The Government is trying to force dual citizenship on to the Bantu. The only citizenship the Bantu want at present is South African citizenship. The only citizenship which will be recognized internationally is South African citizenship which this Government cannot deprive them of. It is all right saying that they will not be treated as aliens in this country. This Government cannot deprive them of their citizenship. The hon. the Minister is trying to make it meaningful by discriminating against those who do not apply for citizenship. He can do that by giving preference in the issuing of permits for work in urban areas to those who apply for citizenship.</p>

It was then pointed out that they could get certain benefits if they applied to become voters and citizens of the Transkei. <span class="col_1793-1794" refersTo="page_0911"/>Obviously this meant that if they were citizens of the Transkei and could prove that they have registered themselves as voters, they could be given preference in seeking work. And this is what is going to happen. When work seekers come from the homelands to urban areas preference will be given to those who can produce certificates to show that they have accepted Government policy of separate citizenship.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, gentle persuasion. Citizenship should be something definite. Every citizen should know definitely to which country he belongs. It does happen at times that there is uncertainty about a person&#x2019;s citizenship. This is usually the case when a person changes his citizenship, either voluntarily or involuntarily, when because of a war or some other reason the boundaries of countries are changed. In this Bill, however, the Government is deliberately creating confusion for its citizens by trying to force another citizenship on them, which in itself is not clear. What will be the test of citizenship? The hon. the Minister has already read this particular provision of the Bill. I will do so again. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; every person falling within any of the undermentioned classes of persons shall be a citizen of a particular territorial authority, area that is to say&#x2014;</block>

<p>In paragraphs (c) and (d) the determining factors are language or dialects of a language, relationship with members of the population of a particular area or identification with a part of the population of an area, or association with any part of such population by virtue of cultural or racial background. So now you know.</p>

<p>It is not certain how many urban Bantu there are in the country. The figure varies but I presume there are between 3&#x00BD; million and 4 million. Many of them have contracted ethnically mixed marriages and are therefore related to populations in different areas. Many of them speak many Bantu languages and different dialects. They will therefore qualify for multiple citizenship.</p>

<p>Admittedly they will have a right of appeal if they find that they are classified in the wrong country. If they do not wish to be Transkeians of Zulus, they can appeal to the Minister against their classification. The Minister will have the final say. Admittedly, too, if a homeland is not satisfied in having a particular citizen thrust upon it through the designated Officer having decided that that Bantu is a citizen of a particular homeland, that homeland can object. It can also appeal to the Minister. The Minister then has the final say. Just imagine what the position will be of an African who having been rejected by the homeland is told by the Minister that he is in fact a citizen of that homeland. Just imagine what his position is going to be in a homeland where they do not want him. What is more, this citizenship is being forced on him. He has not asked for it. He merely wants to be a South African citizen as he is now. And who made him a South African citizen? This Government did when it passed the South African Citizenship Act. He is a South African citizen.</p>

<p>Apart from enabling the Government to juggle with race statistics this citizenship plan can only be explained as part of an ideological concept. This the hon. the Minister in fact did to-night. The Government likes to look upon the peoples of South Africa, as he has said, as separate nations. He tries to persuade the world that he is dealing with a problem of separate nations. They are not racial problems. He is dealing with separate nations. Each of these nations, he says, will be entitled to separate freedoms and separate sovereignty.</p>

<p>How can every Transkeian go and live in the Transkei? How can the reserves possibly take the Bantu population? Even the Government has accepted that. That hon. member ought to know that the Prime Minister said that numbers no longer counted. [Interjections.] It is because they cannot get them into the reserves.</p>

<p>This Bill is intended to support the imaginings of the Government. The facts are so dear that they cannot deceive anybody. The speech of the hon. the Minister to-night on this Bill represents the collapse of the elaborate apartheid edifice. Due to the inability to achieve meaningful separation of the races, physical separation now becomes passport separation. This is documentary separation. We passed a Bill this morning which has since gone to the Other Place which will enable the hon. the Minister to tell the public that the Government is applying apartheid amongst the workers and that it is bringing about separation. He has had to pass a Bill in order to try and convince them that he is doing something. This is just another example of his documentary apartheid.</p>

<p>This Bill is not necessary at this stage. This is not a matter of urgency. Why must this Bill be passed during this short session of Parliament? Why has it become urgent? There are no prospects of any homeland becoming independent before the 22nd April. There is no prospect of any other territorial authorities being recognized. Why has this Bill become so urgent that it has to be forced through in this short session of Parliament before an election? It is an attempt to rally the &#x201C;Vorster-Sappe&#x201D; and to stop them from becoming &#x201C;Hertzog-Sappe&#x201D;. What they should realize is that they are overlooking the fact that the members of their party who are now disappearing from their ranks are not joining the &#x201C;Hertzog-Sappe&#x201D;. They are joining the genuine &#x201C;Sappe&#x201D;. They are joining the United Party, and a measure of this nature is not going to help them, because it is not the verkramptes they have to fight now. It is the United Party they have to fight. The voters have realized that this is impracticable politics. The electorate have been looking for the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy. They are not going to be spoofed and fooled any longer. They are not going to be satisfied with documentary apartheid any longer. They want to see deeds. This Bill is an impracticable measure. It cannot achieve anything. We reject it in the strongest possible terms, and therefore I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to make a few remarks in pursuance of what the hon. member for Transkei has just said. The first remark is that those hon. members, as they are sitting there, i.e. the members of the United Party, have never over all the years had any realization of the profound task we have with regard to the peoples in South Africa. They have never understood anything of the task which this party has set for itself in South Africa. As regards those hon. members, their concern has never been one which recognizes a task with regard to our peoples. The hon. member for Transkei showed us precisely what their concern was. He said, &#x201C;After all, these people are not going to have a better family life there. They are not going to have greater security. They will have to pay more tax.&#x201D; Everything the hon. member said dealt with economic considerations. That is the only concern of that party as regards South Africa&#x2019;s policy with regard to its peoples. If no economic content can be given to it, as the hon. member for Hillbrow does, by involving the non-Whites in our employment, etc., I wonder whether they would ever have been able to discuss legislation of this kind. For them there must be an economic content, but of the realities of South Africa, and also of the realities of our peoples, of which the Minister told us so brilliantly this evening, those hon. members have never been able to form any concept. Furthermore, they have never accepted that the National Party has set itself a task and that it has a policy which is being implemented logically and step by step. We do not jump from one thing to another as that side of this House does. I regret that I do not have the cutting here, but as recently as 1967 the hon. member for Yeoville said, &#x201C;Mention is made of our policy. It is so clear, and I cannot understand why people are still asking questions about it.&#x201D; He said that in 1967. At their congress last year, however, there were complaints: &#x201C;If only the United Party leadership would tell us what this race federation policy is about, we would understand, but we have to put up candidates in the rural areas and everywhere, and no one knows what this policy is about.&#x201D; I mention this to show that it was necessary for their own people to complain at a congress, because they did not understand what their policy was about. In contrast to that the National Party has set itself a task of implementing a policy logically and step by step in order to give the Whites in South Africa a safe place to live in and a secure existence. Our policy is also aimed at leading the non-Whites, of whom we are the guardians at the moment, on that road which the hon. the Minister indicated to us.</p>

<p>It is interesting, however, to note what the hon. member for Transkei said. He said: &#x201C;You are now giving the Bantu a homeland whether they want that homeland or not.&#x201D; It is very interesting. The homeland is, after all, a reality. Each of these Bantu people, whether they be Zulu, Xhosa or Tswana. can, after all, be related to a specific geographical area in South Africa. Therefore this is a reality. But the hon. member maintained that we were forcing this onto them. In terms of United Party policy, <span class="col_1797-1798" refersTo="page_0913"/>they tell the Bantu: &#x201C;We want to give you something which is still very far removed from reality, but which we want to make a reality. We want to give you eight white representatives in this Parliament.&#x201D; Now I ask the hon. member: &#x201C;If the Bantu do not want to accept that, in what way are they going to use compulsion to ensure that those representatives will be Whites, and that the number will remain at eight?&#x201D;</p>

<p>The homeland territories are a reality we have in South Africa. The policy of this party fits in with that. Those hon. members only have expectations which they can give the Bantu. Now we simply ask: How are they going to apply compulsion to the Bantu when they demand certain things in connection with this Parliament?&#x201D; But I shall come back to this. The time has arrived in South Africa not to use only economic arguments in respect of this matter all the time. It is our task, in the development of the Bantu peoples, to see to the economic development of those people as well. But it is so much more important that these people, who have their own languages, who live within their own cultural communities, who have their own traditions and histories. should also be given an identity of their own in this fatherland of ours by means of a process of unscrambling. Those words are important to us as well, not only in respect of the Whites, but also in respect of the non-White peoples, because we are already identifying them.</p>

<p>The emancipation process has, in fact, already caused certain words to fall into disuse in South Africa. Earlier on we simply used the collective term &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister too pointed this out this evening. The words &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;, &#x201C;African&#x201D; and &#x201C;Native&#x201D; were used and these words simply included all people who, like the Bantu, are dark-skinned. But the emancipation process has already progressed so far that we tend to use that collective term less and less. We are using terms such as &#x201C;Xhosa&#x201D;, &#x201C;Zulu&#x201D;, &#x201C;Tswana&#x201D;, etc., more and more. Why are we doing this? We are doing it because we have good reason to do so. One reason is that those people are called by those names because they are associated with a specific geographical area. Such a person refers to himself as a Xhosa, or a Zulu, or a Tswana. We are taking into account that reality of emancipation, which is taking place more and more.</p>

<p>This Bill is connected with the policy of the National Party, and this is no casual connection. It flows logically from the steps we have already taken by means of the legislation we have placed on the Statute Book. I almost want to say that it follows inevitably on what we have already placed on the Statute Book. If a homeland territory is an inalienable element of our policy, a homeland in which the legitimate inhabitants of that homeland can progress even to full emancipation and eventually to independence, then the granting of citizenship must be a logical next step in the implementation of our policy, and citizenship is in fact an element in the policy of the National Party. The political development of the Bantu is linked to a specific territory. Within that territory, within their traditional and historical homeland, they must exercise their political rights. Therefore it is virtually self evident that they should be citizens of that territory in every sense of the word, constitutionally and legally, on the basis of an Act of this Parliament. By these means a further link with the territory of the homeland is being created, a link with the group of people of whom they form part. They are being imbued with a love for those homeland territories where the have their origins. In all the constitutional development the Bantu have already experienced in South Africa, this is simply the next step. We can go back in history and examine the position from 1910 onwards. The 1913 legislation had as its basis political development associated with a homeland territory. The 1926 legislation has as its basis political development associated with a homeland territory. In this memorandum to which the hon. the Minister referred, we find the various pieces of legislation which have been passed since 1951. There was the Bantu Authorities Act and in 1959 the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act. Arising from that, we have the various territorial authorities. Finally we find the Transkeian Constitution and now this legislation. It is very clear that the thread running through all this is political development associated with a homeland territory, but in this process the element of citizenship was lacking. This constitutional development may be summarized as follows: Separation in the first instance, developing governmental institutions and development within a particular homeland territory, a distinctive group with its own identity and culture, and then finally citizenship. This admirably rounds off this whole identity principle of people who are linked to a certain territory.</p>

<p>It will also pay us to look at what has happened in Africa. The upsurge of nationalism in Africa, especially after the Second World War, found expression in peculiar forms. To our view of thinking it perhaps led to premature independence, and unfortunately it has also left revolt, racial and group conflicts in its wake. But even if there is instability, even if there is uncertainty in many of these governments which came into being as a result of this upsurging nationalism, the fact of the matter is that nationalism in Africa got the upper hand and this has resulted in citizenship of their own states.</p>

<li>(2) Yes. Twenty-two persons were convicted of theft or malicious damage to property during 1967-&#x2019;68 and twenty-seven during 1968-&#x2019;69. These persons are believed to have been responsible for most of the damage&#x2014;one person alone being convicted on one hundred and seven counts.</li>

<li>(3) Yes. So far as possible call Offices are erected in safe places, such as in or near buildings where people are always in attendance, in spots which are well <span class="col_1803-1804" refersTo="page_0916"/>lit at night, or near police stations. Those which are damaged very frequently are moved to safer places or removed completely. Research is continuously being carried out to design apparatus offering greater resistance to vandals. To make it too dangerous for thieves and vandals to continue their mischief, more and more call Offices are being equipped with alarms. Radio cars are also used to trace culprits. Rewards are offered for information leading to their arrest and conviction. The old concrete booths with wooden doors are also gradually being replaced by steel or aluminium booths with armour-plate glass mounted in rubber mouldings.</li>

<li>(4) Yes. The frequency of these inspections varies from daily to weekly visits depending on where the call Offices are situated, how extensively they are used and how subject they are to damage. Those, for instance, at the Johannesburg railway station, Jan Smuts airport and large post Offices in the area are inspected daily. The same applies to Cape Town and certain other large centres. Tests are also normally made when the coin boxes are cleared or after they have been cleaned.</li>

<from>Mr. L. E. D. WINCHESTER</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Community Development:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether properties owned by Whites in Lower Bridge Road, Durban, were expropriated; if so, for what purpose;</li>

<li>(2) whether the same properties were offered for sale by public tender; if so, to persons of what race group;</li>

<li>(3) whether any profit was made on these properties; if so, who will receive the benefit.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_community_development" to="#winchester">

<from>The MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. The relative properties were expropriated by the Community Development Board during 1966 on the expert advice of the Department&#x2019;s Chief Town Planner. They are situated within the Prospect Hall area which was replanned by a State Committee in conjunction with a committee of the Durban Corporation so as to adapt the township layout plan to modern requirements and to ensure the more appropriate usage of the land. During negotiations it was carefully explained that the expropriation was necessary for these purposes as slum conditions prevailed in the whole of the area which had to be renewed as an entity.

<p>The expropriated persons were at the same time informed by my Department that in the event of their properties not being required for subdivision or for road and other purposes after replanning, they could re-purchase the properties from the Department. After the replanning of the area had been approved in principle by the Durban Townships Commission, it transpired that the properties would in fact not be affected and all the former owners were during February, 1968 advised in writing that the Community Development Board would withdraw the expropriation of the properties against the repayment of the original compensation plus interest at 6&#x00BE; per cent. The Board bore all other costs. It may be mentioned that the Board paid extremely reasonable compensation to the expropriated persons.</p></li>

<li>(2) No, as some properties were taken back by their previous owners and the properties of persons who were not prepared to take them back, were subsequently let. The Board ultimately during 1969 decided to renovate those properties and that tenders should be called for the sale thereof to Whites. Tenders have now been received but have not yet been considered by the Board.</li>

According to the management companies concerned, the delay is due to administrative difficulties. The assurance was obtained from the management companies that investors will not be placed at a disadvantage as a result of any delay, since the repurchase price will be based on the price of the sub-units prevailing on the day when the application for repurchase is received. Furthermore, the management companies concerned are prepared, in exceptional cases where a long delay has occurred, to pay reasonable interest on the relevant amount for the period of the delay.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the principle in the legislation before the House is to provide our workers with better training. This is a principle which we accept and, in fact, in contrast to the Government it is one which we have consistently supported. The Government has been extremely tardy in this regard and it is as a result of prodding from this side of the House that we now have this piece of legislation before us. We see this as a small reward for our past efforts and endeavours in this particular regard.</p>

<p>As far as the usefulness of this legislation is concerned, we must of course view it against the background of the manpower needs in our country. Whenever we talk about the manpower shortage the Government accuses us of trying to create a crisis situation which we want to exploit for political purposes. It is not just this side of the House that talks about a manpower crisis. The chiefs of the Civil Service say exactly the same. The industrialists say there is a crisis situation. The Afrikaner entrepreneurs say exactly the same. In fact the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s colleagues in the Cabinet, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and the hon. the Minister of finance, say precisely the same. So if everybody can see a crisis situation, why cannot he. He cannot because the situation is unpalatable to him. That is why he is not prepared to see it.</p>

<p>As far as the results of this legislation are concerned, we are quite clear in our own minds that it will stimulate greater training activity at the lower levels in industry. This obviously we approve of. But when we say that, we are as charitable as we possibly can be about this piece of legislation. As indicated before, it makes no provision for training at the management levels. It is precisely at these levels that greater productivity accrues. Every study that has been done show that there is a direct corelation between the level of your &#x2026;</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as we see, South Africa is at the stage where our rate of fixed investment has reached almost 20 per cent of our gross national product. This means that we are rapidly entering a new era of industrialization. We are now reaching a stage where we will soon become a mature economic society. We would have thought that under these conditions the Government would have produced dynamically new ideas to cater for this particular situation. We regard this legislation now before us as narrow in conception. We see it as being limited in its application. It is our view that it will make only a minimal contribution to increased industrial activity in South Africa. We see here a piece of legislation which is essentially a piece of patchwork. We see something that has been hastily planned, that has been shoddily presented. We have grave doubts about the efficacy of this piece of legislation towards increased productivity. Let me say right away that Volkshandel is quite correct when they say that productivity in South Africa is not as high as it should be. There are after all external norms against which we can measure this. Australia, with a smaller population than South Africa, produces almost twice as much as we do. Canada has a total population which is the same as ours, but the value of their industrial production is almost six times as great as our own. So, in this regard, there is a tremendous shortfall that must be made good, and we had hoped that this legilation would do so.</p>

<p>We are continually being told that South Africa is doing so well in the industrial field. Of course we are, but I think our progress industrially is due primarily to two factors. Firstly, we have virtually unlimited natural resources and, secondly, we have a massive reservoir of non-White labour who are prepared to work at rates of pay which are only a fraction of those earned by their compatriots. Sir, the wealth of a nation is not found in its gold and its diamonds, but in the talents of its people. The most rewarding and the best long-term investment that South Africa can make, is to invest in the training and education of her people. We see here an example of a government which is investing in such training, but we see it also as an example of complete under <span class="col_1841-1842" refersTo="page_0935"/>investment. We see here a situation which we think our children will blame us for one day.</p>

<p>The responses that the hon. the Minister has given us in regard to the training of non-Whites we find completely inadequate. From time to time we are told by the other side of the House that this Government&#x2019;s approach is one of separation but equality. We see here indications of separation, but we see absolutely no signs of the equality we are told about. The hon. the Minister tells us that non-Whites should be trained, but only for work in their own areas. How does this apply to the Coloured people? Where are the areas in which Coloured people should carry out these high-level tasks? Where are the Asians or the Indians to carry out these tasks for which they must be trained? When we come to the Africans, the Minister says that they must be trained in these high-level tasks, but that they must carry them out in their own areas. Sir, we are dealing with a practical situation in South Africa. Where are these areas? Is the hon. the Minister trying to tell us that he is training Africans to do high-level, skilled tasks in Zululand?</p>

<p>I appreciate that, Sir. In motivating this legislation now before us, the Minister said that Africans must be trained in terms of the specifications of this legislation, but they must only operate in their own areas. Is it proper for me to ask him where these areas for the Africans are? Is it proper for me to ask him how many skilled jobs there are at the moment in Zululand for Africans to carry out this training he is talking about? Sir, the trouble is that whenever we raise these particular matters, the only reaction we get from the Government side is that we want to open the sluice gates for non-Whites. In this debate on this particular issue that has been the only reaction we have had from the Government, That is not what we are doing. We are drawing attention to the facts of the South African situation. When that side of the House measures legislation of this kind, they measure it in terms of the number of votes it will bring them. There are some members there who crave votes almost in the same way as the devil craves souls. Here we see another opportunity that has been lost. Another excellent opportunity for South Africa to advance into the new technological era has been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency. That is why more and more people in South Africa are beginning to say that it is time for a change, that South Africa deserves better.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have just listened to a repetition of stale arguments and I do not consider it necessary to reply to them in detail, except for saying quite candidly to the House that this measure is not going to bring about anything spectacular. Nor does it pretend that it will, because we have to deal with our available manpower, which we must train better. But this measure is going to provide us with the encouragement to train the available manpower better. To make the reproach that we have not come forward with something dynamic, prompts the question of whether the hon. member is labouring under the delusion that copying the British Act, which has not proved to be a success in Britain, will give us something dynamic. I want to say very briefly that this measure will, in fact, provide us with a stimulus to undertake training. That will be an asset. It will give us more trained people. Not only Whites, but also non-Whites will get their opportunities, but we must understand very clearly that it will take place within the framework of our traditional labour pattern. I contend myself with that, and <b>I</b> trust that this measure, which enjoys the co-operation of the industrialists in the country, will be a decided asset to South Africa.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of subsection (2).</block>

<p>I do so with the greatest regret, and only because I feel that, unless this is done, the Bill will to some extent cause difficulties with regard to certain transplantations.</p>

<p>This is partly due to the fact that the Select Committee of which I myself was a member and which gave consideration to the matter before including this clause, felt that it was a safeguard which was necessary. One of the <span class="col_1843-1844" refersTo="page_0936"/>things that has happened is, however, that my attention has been drawn by certain medical men concerned with this matter, to the fact that this clause will actually prevent certain transplants being done. Secondly, strangely enough the important fact has arisen that more research since the introduction of this Bill originally has made this clause out of date. The knowledge of the advances which have now been published shows that it will handicap this work. The main handicap will be in the case of kidney transplants. This clause states that in the case of unidentified bodies where the relatives cannot be found and the body cannot be identified, it may be used for transplants. The clause unfortunately also states that the district surgeon who will give authority for the use of this donor must have a certificate saying that two doctors have certified that the use of this graft is necessary in this patient in order immediately to save his life.</p>

<p>It has been found, and this practice is common as there are about 200 such machines in use in this country, that people who have lost all kidney function can be kept alive for a considerable period, if not indefinitely. There are not sufficient machines in the country to start with and, secondly, it is a trial for people to have to go twice a week or perhaps more frequently to a hospital or some institution in order to be connected up to a machine and their blood to be purified of the waste products which the loss of their kidney function keeps in their blood and in their bodies. These waste products are extracted and they go away comparatively happy. It is common knowledge in medicine that a man can live without kidneys or without kidney function and without any treatment for approximately 10 days. In the case of a man who is not near such a machine or on whom such a machine has not been used or in the case of a man for whom it has taken 10 days to find an unidentified donor, it would be quite true at this stage for the district surgeon to get a certificate saying that two doctors are satisfied that for the immediate saving of this man&#x2019;s life it is necessary to use this graft as there is nothing else available. All this adds to the complications.</p>

<p>Naturally, it would be better if the district surgeon would accept a certificate saying that the man&#x2019;s kidneys no longer function and that as a result of the use of such machine he is all right for the moment. At that stage, however, the district surgeon is not going to accept such a certificate and the doctors are not going to issue it because this clause contains the word &#x201C;immediate&#x201D;. It is going to complicate matters. It is going to handicap the transplantation of kidneys to a great extent. We must of course also remember that time is now marching on and that doctors are finding ways of preserving the organs of donors, such as hearts. Patients with failing hearts can be kept alive for a period by machines and all this will be taken into account in applying the pro visions of this particular paragraph of the clause. As time goes on we will have the invention of a mechanical heart which is unlikely to be a permanent structure but which will be able to tide people over for perhaps 36 hours. Then there is the introduction of the auxilliary heart, as is being done now. They are connecting poor hearts with other poor hearts and using them in tandem to keep the recipient alive while they search for a donor. All these developments are changing the picture and this clause is going to add to the difficulties. It serves no purpose if you think of it. The recipient is perhaps not in immediate need as he can he tided over for a short period but he is undoubtedly in need of a graft and he should be able to receive it. To handicap him because the organ is coming from an unknown donor is, I think, purely red tape. It was unfortunate that we on the Select Committee did not have sufficient knowledge at that particular time. I blame myself largely for this clause being included in the Bill. It does no good; it may in fact do harm.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have great admiration for the reasons the hon. member has advanced here for proposing this amendment. I know that he would like to assist doctors in every possible way to do transplants for the benefit of their patients. That is why he has mentioned the specific case of kidney transplants. Those were not and could not possibly be the only considerations which are relevant to this particular matter. I think that to accept this amendment, and I say this with great respect, would be going against the spirit and the whole tenor of the deliberations of the Select Committee when this Bill was before it. I say this because the subparagraph which the hon. member proposes be deleted was inserted after the Committee very carefully went into the other side of the picture. We have on the one hand the question of doing a transplant for the benefit of a patient but we also have to consider the position of the donor. If the donor himself has not donated part of his body or his whole body, I think this Parliament should be careful not to take away certain rights. I think the Select Committee was. quite rightly, very careful in this regard. I think that this Parliament should be very careful not to take away rights from the near relatives of such a deceased person. In all instances, wherever possible, we should like the right to be vested either in the person himself or his near relatives to donate tissue for transplant. We have done so in this Bill but we have also foreseen that there might be certain very special exceptions. The word &#x201C;immediately&#x201D; has, I think, not come into this clause by chance but was deliberately put there. I say this because if you read clause 2 (2) (a) (i) carefully you find that it states specifically&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) in the case of any tissue, other than eye tissue, two other medical pactitioners have stated in writing that in their opinion the use of such tissue in the <span class="col_1845-1846" refersTo="page_0937"/>body of another person is immediately necessary &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>What does this mean? It means that where the relatives cannot be traced or where the relatives are for one reason or another not available, and the tissue is immediately necessary to save a life, in that particular case, and in that particular case only, we take away the rights of the near relatives and vest them in two medical practitioners. To my mind it would not be sufficient to leave it in the hands only of a district surgeon. I would think that it would be too great a responsibility for any district surgeon to carry by himself. Now let us take the case of a kidney transplant. As the hon. member has said, it is quite right that such a patient might be kept alive for a considerable time by other methods. In a case like that it is not immediately necessary to transplant the kidney of a person where the relatives are not available. In the case the hon. member mentioned kidneys usually come from other sources. To-day kidneys are readily available and I am therefore unfortunately not in a position to accept this amendment proposed by the hon. member. I do think that this clause serves a definite purpose which was foreseen by the Select Committee and which was deliberately included in this Bill. I want to support this clause very strongly so that in the minds of the general public there will be no question of their rights being transgressed except in eases where there is an immediate necessity for saving the life of a person. I would like the hon. member to accept that I am not accepting his amendment, not because he introduced it, but because I want to give full credit to this Bill and to the tenor of the deliberations of the Select Committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can quite easily see the reasons for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s opinion and I find it difficult to disagree with him, because I was a member of that Select Committee. It is true that a certificate of immediate necessity is a safeguard, but I feel it is a safeguard that may cost lives, if surgeons have to wait for a certain length of time in these cases. We must assume that in the carrying out of this particular clause, the district surgeon will satisfy himself that every effort to trace the relatives has been unsuccessful. The donor himself may be unindentified. The amount of damage in, for example, a kidney transplant to a body is minimal and it does not, as in the case of for example, the cornea which is excluded in this clause, lead to disfigurement. In kidney transplants no disfigurement takes place and there will be no pain to relatives if they find that a kidney has been removed, except in very exceptional cases.</p>

<p>That is true. Those reasons are very rapidly breaking down these days.

<p>Mr. Chairman, following on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reasoning, which I fully understand and appreciate, I would say that we on this side of the House accept what the hon. the Minister said. Following on what the hon. the Minister has said, I think it makes the amendment standing in my name even more necessary. It would appear that there is no alternative, in the clause, to a district surgeon. As the clause now stands, if a district surgeon is unavailable, then the chances of authorization are negligible. To avoid the possibility of missing the use of part of a donor&#x2019;s body in an emergency, I would suggest that after the word &#x201C;surgeon&#x201D; in subsection (2) (b) we insert &#x201C;or any other medical practitioner designated by the Minister by regulation&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister will know how often it happens that district surgeons are unavailable at a given time. We all know how necessary it is to obtain immediate sanction. For this reason I therefore say that the hon. the Minister should, by regulation, designate whom he thinks could be an alternative to the district surgeon. The same set of circumstances arise in subsection (2) (b) (ii) which reads &#x201C;such district surgeon is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace the persons referred to in paragraph (a)&#x201D;. If the hon. the Minister will accept my amendment, this paragraph will read as follows: &#x201C;Such district surgeon or any other medical practitioner is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace the persons referred to in paragraph (a).&#x201D; This will avoid what might happen when a district surgeon is not available. I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with reference to the hon. member for Rosettenville&#x2019;s argument and his amendment. I would like to point out to the Select Committee members who have spoken, that our deliberations were actually around two factors. The one was the sanctity of the family as far as the deceased person was concerned, and the second was that we gave a lot of thought to the protection of the medical profession in dealing with donors and donatees. If we accept the amendment of the hon. member for Rosettenville, <span class="col_1847-1848" refersTo="page_0938"/>it actually means that we are now taking the whole matter away from the department back to the doctors. If one takes this in conjunction with the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (Central) it simply means that consent will only have to be given by one medical practitioner, designated by the Minister by regulation. Is that correct?</p>

<p>I see. When we discussed this matter of the district surgeon on the Select Committee we felt that there should be a referee who is actually responsible to the department. If other medical men have to be accepted by regulation by the hon. the Minister, it simply means that the hon. the Minister will probably appoint the various superintendents of hospitals.</p>

<p>But surely there is nobody whom he will not approve of. Those persons are, however, not directly responsible to him in terms of departmental rules and regulations. Our whole discussion was that we should have a completely independent referee so that we could avoid any criticism of doctors in hospitals. One would find, for example, that the person appointed by regulation is the superintendent of the hospital. The surgical team would also be members of the same hospital. The family cannot be traced. After a few days the members of the family suddenly come onto the scene and they ask, &#x201C;What has happened to our deceased brother?&#x201D;, or whatever the case may be. Then there is immediately criticism. But this whole matter was handled by the internal staff of the hospital. When the district surgeon is present, at least one can say that in this case the district surgeon was entirely a departmental medical Officer apart from the members of the particular hospital where the operation took place. To say that the district surgeon could not be found, I do not think is correct; because where these operations take place there is always a district surgeon at hand.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have to realize that when we refer to district surgeons in this clause, we are dealing with a very important function which is now being placed in the hands of district surgeons in addition to their other functions. I should like to remind hon. members of the fact that in terms of this legislation the primary right to donate his body or part of his body rests with the person himself. At his death, if he had not done so, either his wife, a major child, a parent, a major brother or a major sister may make such a donation. I think this is fine. The &#x201C;sanctity of the family&#x201D;, to use the words of the hon. member for Prinshof, is being preserved here. When they cannot be found, we place the onus in certain respects for the machinery which has to be created as well as for certain decisions which have to be taken, on the district surgeon. This is a great responsibility. I think hon. members will agree with me that if it is at all possible to do so, we should place this responsibility only in the hands of district surgeons who are officials of the State and of my department. I have control over them. That is the first point.</p>

<p>The second point is that one does not want to delay transplants or donations unnecessarily. At times, speed is required in connection with these things. If that danger did exist. I think the amendment of the hon. member for Rosettenville would have been valid; but in reality this does not exist. I want to tell the hon. member that I have 514 part-time and full-time district surgeons throughout the country. I think this is a sufficient number for covering the entire country. The second point is that most of these situations will arise in our larger cities and not as much at the small hospitals. In our larger cities we have a district surgeon and several assistants who have a permanent Office. In other words, there is an organization that is available for this service at any time of the day.</p>

<p>The further point I want to make is that if the onus were to be placed on me to authorize other practitioners as well, the two hon. members, who are medical men, will realize that I simply would not be able to turn down any superintendent of a hospital. Surely I cannot make a choice and say that the superintendent of Groote Schuur hospital is suitable, but that the superintendent of the Beaufort West hospital is not suitable. They are both registered doctors. I am afraid that I shall be flooded by applications, because this is also going to be a matter of prestige. Hospitals will feel that they also want their man in that position, where as that will, in fact, be superfluous in view of the large number of available district surgeons.</p>

<p>But allow me to mention a further point which to my mind is also very valid. The hon. member for Prinshof also touched on this. We want to create as much satisfaction and confidence as possible in the minds of the public, because we want to acquire as much tissue as possible, or, entire bodies of deceased people on behalf of patients who need certain organs. Now, I am of the opinion that it will bring about complete satisfaction and confidence if the public were to know that this important function would be in the hands of district surgeons only, who, under no circumstances, could play any role whatsoever in the transplant team. I think this is a very important argument which I should bear in mind in considering <span class="col_1849-1850" refersTo="page_0939"/>this proposed amendment. For that reason I want to ask the hon. member for Rosettenville the friendly question whether he does not want to agree with me that we should rather leave matters as they are. I am prepared, if real problems should arise at any time, to reconsider the matter. I am of the opinion that we should leave the firm foundation which the Select Committee created for us, and which seems to be capable of full implementation by me in practice, undisturbed, and that we should not accept this amendment.</p>

There is something in what the hon. the Minister has said, but there is also something in what I say. I feel that if we can avoid the question of unnecessary delay, we should take the opportunity of introducing this small amendment now. However, if the hon. the Minister feels that we should first see how the provisions of this clause work in practice, let us do so. If he should later find that it becomes necessary to introduce the type of amendment which I put forward to-day, I understand that the hon. the Minister will readily come forward to the House and amend this Bill. In that spirit I would be prepared to withdraw my amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper at page 131, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 19, page 5, after &#x201C;traced&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;because such person is unidentified or for any other reason&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of this amendment is to give the district surgeon in cases where relatives cannot be found and where he has to give permission for the removal of an organ from a body for transplantation, a little more leeway. This would be possible if the words, as I have moved in my amendment, &#x201C;because such person is unidentified or for any other reason&#x201D;, are inserted after the word &#x201C;traced&#x201D;. As the Bill stands at the present moment, if the spouse or any major child or any parent or any major brother or major sister of such person cannot be traced, the district surgeon may give his permission for the removal of the organ. Clause 2 (2) (b) (ii) lays down that a district surgeon can give his permission provided that &#x201C;such district surgeon is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace the persons referred to in paragraph (a)&#x201D;, that is the persons that I have mentioned, namely the spouse or any major child and so on. The man who has to issue a certificate to this effect is a Government official. This is a fairly serious decision that he has to make. He cannot make the decision unless he is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace the persons referred to, that is, the relatives. If the prospective donor is unidentified, the district surgeon cannot strictly speaking be satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace the persons referred to, i.e. the relatives. He cannot be satisfied because no steps in fact can have been taken to trace the relatives because the man is unidentified. Therefore the district surgeon cannot satisfy himself that all reasonable steps have been taken in this regard. The amendment which I propose will, I think, clarify this position. This is not a terribly important matter, but I should imagine that a large number of the donors in these transplant cases are, for example, unindentified motor accident victims whose brain function has ceased and who are in fact dead. I would suggest that this will in fact help the district surgeon in satisfying himself that reasonable steps have been taken to trace the relatives. If the person is unidentified, the district surgeon cannot satisfy himself of that. Therefore, I move this amendment in the spirit of helpfulness, the same spirit in which the other amendments have been moved.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to move the amendment as it appears under my name in the Order Paper. This amendment is complementary to the one which was moved by the hon. member for Durban (North). I think this is a matter of phraseology and also clarity in so far as the duties of the district surgeon are concerned. In terms of subsection (2) (b) (ii) of clause 2, the district surgeon must be satisfied &#x201C;that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace the persons referred to in paragraph (a)&#x201D;. If a person has not been identified, no steps can be taken or could have been taken to trace relatives. If one has it clarified, the position will be that the district surgeon must be satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken to trace the persons referred to in clause 2 (2) (a) provided those steps could be commenced. In other words, the donor body has been identified or he must be satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken to identify such a person. It seems to me that such an amendment would clarify the position as far as the district surgeon is concerned. Either the person has been identified and he is satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken to trace the relatives, or he has been satisfied that the person is unidentified and reasonable steps have been taken to identify that person. It is merely a matter of wording, but I think it does clarify the duties of the district surgeon. I do not think it does violence to any of the views we had on the Select Committee. It certainly does no violence to the motivation of this clause and the protection of the unidentified person&#x2019;s relatives from any hasty decision which could have been taken where the removal of an organ for transplantation is involved. I therefore move the following amendment as it appears on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1851-1852" refersTo="page_0940"/>In line 33, after &#x201C;(a)&#x201D; to add &#x201C;or to identify such person&#x201D;.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>With respect to both my learned friends and also with a feeling of gratitude for the spirit in which these amendments were requested, I am of the opinion that the amendments requested are, in fact, already contained in the existing wording of this clause. To me it would appear that if we were to add anything, such an addition would, in fact, serve no purpose. I think the hon. members are quite correct in maintaining that the word &#x201C;unidentified&#x201D; would clarify the position to some extent. I am of the opinion that in the case as indicated by the words &#x201C;if none of the persons referred to in paragraph (a) can be traced&#x201D;, two medical practitioners may certify that the tissue is required to save a life if &#x201C;such district surgeon is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace the persons referred to in paragraph (a)&#x201D;. In my modest opinion it is virtually axiomatic that once the district surgeon has made that determination, it would have been necessary for him to have taken certain steps before in order to determine that such a person could not be identified. He cannot simply say that a person is unidentified. Certain steps have to be taken to try to identify that person. If that is impossible, it is also automatically impossible to identify the family of that person. Consequently there is a series of steps which have to be taken before the district surgeon will be satisfied. He will say, &#x201C;The following steps have been taken for identification purposes: they have failed and as a result it has been impossible for me to trace the people and I hereby certify.&#x201D; I want to suggest that what my hon. friends should, in fact, have requested was possibly for a small amendment to be made at some later stage to the Anatomy Act, which in fact deals with unidentified people and indigent people, but in this Bill, as it stands, the existing phraseology is, in my opinion, adequate to achieve exactly what my hon. friends would like to achieve.</p>

<p>I have always felt it to be a major shortcoming in my education that I have not had legal training as well, because how are we, as doctors, to decide when our learned legal friends differ to such an extent? In this matter, at least with regard to those who participated in this debate, we are three against three. I know the hon. members for Rosettenville and Durban (Central) will side with me and that the other three members will side together. Last night and this morning I made a very careful study of this matter, and I have just listened to the speeches of the hon. members here. Let me concede this one point at once: I think there would be more clarity if I were to accept the amendments of the hon. members for Durban (North) and Green Point: I want to concede that, but I am not certain whether I seek more clarity. It seems to me that the clause as it stands is adequate and that the proposed addition may be some what superfluous. Let me put it as follows; it seems to me that the Select Committee acted very sensibly with regard to the function of the district surgeon in merely underlining the question of tracing and did not go as far as to bring in, as is now being proposed, the question of identifying as well, because, in my opinion, this is going to complicate the entire position. I say this, because if it were to be laid down specifically that the district surgeon, in terms of the wording of the Act, has to satisfy himself that reasonable steps have been taken not only with regard to tracing but also with regard to identifying, one would be widening the burden on the district surgeon. What would one have to do if the Act provided that one had to take all reasonable steps in order to ascertain whether it was possible to identify the man? I can think of 110 things which might not have been done, and if the Act were to have prescribed to me that I had to give my specific attention to those things, I could imagine that I would hesitate to give permission In other words, in my opinion this would be a handicap to obtaining certain tissue expeditiously. It is for those reasons&#x2014;I have already conceded that if I were to accept the amendment that would bring greater clarity&#x2014;i.e., the fact that this would bring about more complications, the fact that this would, in my opinion, cause more delay, and the fact that this would leave greater doubt in the mind of the district surgeon because it would be prescribed by the Act that he would have to see in his mind&#x2019;s eye the whole series of procedures for identification and that he should ascertain whether those procedures had been followed, that I think that in this case we should leave the matter as it is, not for the sake of clarity but for the sake of being able to bring this matter to finality without any waste of time.</p>

<p>Sir, one appreciates the attitude of the hon. the Minister regarding the suggestions which have been made to him. Does the responsibility to trace include identification? You cannot trace before identification: I realize it is a fine distinction. But, Sir, while we are dealing with this particular clause may I, on this question of unidentified persons, refer to the problems which arise in accident cases where people are injured and unconscious and arrive at the hospital without any means of identification. In subsection (5) of this particular clause provision is made that where a person at the time of his death is wearing any prescribed identity tag issued by an authorized institution, such person shall be deemed to have made a donation, in terms of this section, of his body or of any specified tissue, as the case may be. Then later in clause 13 (g) we come to the power to make regulations as to the form of such tags. I rise merely. Sir. to say that this is a matter which concerned me and my colleagues on the Select Committee considerably, as to how the public could be educated towards the greater use of this system of identification, not only for the <span class="col_1853-1854" refersTo="page_0941"/>purpose of consent to the donation of one&#x2019;s organs if one is involved in an accident and some use can be made of one&#x2019;s organs, but also for ancillary purposes such as blood grouping and matters of that sort which could well be indicated on the same disc. I rise to mention this merely from the point of view of identification. Secondly, I am sure that those concerned with hospitals and this very great problem of identification, will watch with interest the developments that can take place&#x2014; I believe they are based on Medic-Alert, a voluntary organization to ensure that as many of the population as possible wear discs of a type which will not only identify them but will reflect their blood grouping and other relevant information which should be readily available at the hospitals to which they are taken.</p>

<p>In the Bill which we have just passed in Committee, we have attempted to help the living and to preserve the dignity of the dead, but one subject has not been fully aired and it is of vital importance, namely the procurement of donors. This problem is not confined to this country&#x2014;it is worldwide&#x2014;largely because this is, of course, a new development and members of the public have not yet appreciated the importance of the donation of hearts. But there are many other parts of the body which have not the emotional significance of the heart. Many a wife would hesitate to donate the heart of her husband whereas she might not hesitate to donate his kidneys. Sir, the House heard the hon. member for Green Point saying that at the present time donors consist of people who either have a stroke, which does not happen much to the young&#x2014;and it is the hearts of the young under-forties which are needed&#x2014;or are injured in motor accidents or similar accidents. This does happen to young people, if perhaps not as frequently as to older people, but nevertheless it does happen to them because they are the quick ones&#x2014;not the dead. Sir, some effort should be made by the Minister either to set up a committee&#x2014;not a commission&#x2014;or to have a conference, a world conference if necessary, to determine what steps should be taken to procure donors. There is no doubt, as I said yesterday, that World War I brought forth the donors of blood. Before that it was very difficult to obtain blood donors. We cannot wait for a world catastrophe to produce donors of hearts and other organs. One body, as I have said, can supply at least 17 recipients. One would therefore like to have the bodies.</p>

<p>This problem is world-wide. So far only one successful or partially successful register has been introduced. This happens in London. It is so successful that donors are now coming forward, not voluntarily, as I would like to see, because of their desire to make a donation, but because London is such a big area and there are so many motorcars and so many industries in it that there are numbers of accidents and accidental deaths every day. As one doctor from the National Heart Hospital said, this registry in one day provided more donors than he had been able to obtain through the natural process of admissions to his hospital in six months. The registry works on a principle which is quite different from the usual principle. In London there are over 200 surgical hospitals dealing with accidents. They receive these untraced, unidentifiable accident cases, but they also receive accident cases which are traced. At most there are some 10 or 15 transplant teams available in London in the large teaching hospitals and a few other special hospitals which deal with the chest, and then there are kidney hospitals etc. The way this system works, is as follows: Any hospital receiving an accident case where death is likely to ensue despite all efforts, will notify the central registry, and the central registry knows where a recipeint is available. The registry knows the tissue type of the recipient. It does not know the tissue type of the donor. But in the average resuscitation process a blood transfusion is usally carried out. To carry that out the donor&#x2019;s blood grouping must be known, and that is one part of the tissue typing. Then, when the donor or potential donor dies or is reported to be dead, according to our system here, the registry knows where recipients of that blood group are waiting. They do not have to look for a recipient; they know where he is, and at the same time once the donor has been declared dead, tissue can be taken for typing. Up to that time it cannot be done, but then it can be taken, and that is also done by the registry, which maintains a laboratory for this work. We therefore have the position that the registry can inform the hospital where a suitable recipient is, and the donor, or perhaps the organ only can be taken to the recipient. It is not as a rule possible to move the recipient to the donor, firstly because many of the hospitals are not able to do a transplant. This is one way of working it. It works, as I say, in London and it has been tried out in New York, but it has not been a success there.</p>

<p>I should also like to say that this Bill cannot be the end of transplants for always. The scientific work is advancing so rapidly that it is now within the bounds of possibility to remove <span class="col_1855-1856" refersTo="page_0942"/>a viable heart and keep it alive for eight hours, so that in the case like the one I have spoken about, where the tissue has been matched at the registry, it would be possible for one hospital where the donor is to prepare the heart after the man&#x2019;s death and it could be moved to the recipient. In some parts of the world&#x2014;I will not mention them&#x2014;the habit has existed of moving potential donors to the recipient before his death. We in this country feel that such an action is not justified in the case of a man who is not actually declared dead. This could be of interest to the public in the case of moving it from a very poor hospital to a very well-equipped hospital, but in general it is not advisable to deal with the donor until he has become a donor, that is, until he is dead. But the advances are such that the doctors who do this work and the district surgeons who will have to make many difficult decisions will find that they will soon have to ask for amendments to this Bill to meet the increasing knowledge facilities.</p>

<p>I rise to say a few words in pursuance of what was said by the hon. member for Durban (Central). I think he used very moving words here when he said, &#x201C;We have passed this Bill to help the living and preserve the dignity of the dead.&#x201D; I want to agree with him. That is, in fact, the object of this legislation. Those are very moving words, but I think it may be appropriate to say at this stage, where this legislation has been passed, that we should draw the attention not only to the outstanding scientific achievements of the recent past, but also&#x2014;and I believe these are the feelings of the entire House as well as the scientists&#x2014;to the fact that one wants to place on record, and wants to acknowledge, with deep gratitude, in South Africa, in any event, that there is a Higher Hand that disposes over all these things, and that if our scientists, too, were to realize that at all times, the blessings on their work might be so much the greater in years to come.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the effect of this legislation. I think there is a great task ahead to educate the public to be more forthcoming with regard to the donation of bodies and tissue, and I hope the publicity that will emanate from here, will be of some help in this regard. Secondly, the training of doctors and post-graduate students will have to be adapted to these new developments of modern times; and, thirdly, I think without distracting anything from the tremendous achievement of heart transplants, that I should nevertheless point out that that is a dramatic matter, but that there are other transplants which can be done in much greater numbers and with great success for the benefit of patients. I think the public should realize that we should not seek the dramatic only, but also and especially the type of transplant which will enable us to assist the largest possible number of suffering and sick people. The other thing I want to mention in passing before I resume my seat, is the new importance which is arising at present for the establishment of banks for the preservation of tissue so that that tissue may be available at all times. I think the bodies and persons concerned with this matter should give their particular attention to this matter in the years ahead so that we may build up these banks for the benefit of the suffering people who require tissue.</p>

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Simply in order to take up the threads where we left the discussion here last night, I just want to refer to the fact that the hon. the Minister presented to us this matter of citizenship in a brilliant second-reading speech, and that the main speaker on the Opposition side was so indignant that he rejected this Bill in the strongest terms and also moved the amendment you have just read out, i.e. that the Bill be read this day six months. But it is also interesting, Sir, that the hon. member was so indignant that he appeared to have run out of words, because on this very important matter he could only express his indignation for 20 minutes. I told the Opposition that they did not understand our task: the task of founding peoples and forming countries, as the Minister put it so well yesterday. But I also asked them to have regard to a few realities, and I said that this Bill was a logical conclusion of the policy of the National Party and that it was an obvious next step and an indispensable element in the implementation of our policy. Furthermore, I pointed out that it fitted into the pattern of such constitutional and political development as Bantu peoples had already gone through up to this stage. In addition, it creates for the various peoples ties with the traditional homeland policy, which has become historical. What is more, I only started making this point last night, i.e. that we should also take note of what has happened in Africa. I said nationalism had struck Africa like a tidal wave. This was also manifested in strange forms, and here and there independence was granted at too early a stage, to our way of thinking. Along the road leading to liberation it left a tragic trail of revolt, racial tension and group conflict, and everywhere there is still evidence of instability and uncertainty. But the fact of the matter is that nationalism has won the day and that states have come into being, each with its own citizenship. Our neighbouring territories, close to our borders, the former High Commission Territories, have also been caught up in this maelstrom and in this process they have also acquired their own states and their own <span class="col_1857-1858" refersTo="page_0943"/>citizenship. We are also of Africa, and inside the borders of our country there are also ethnic communities and, although they can be distinguished from the ethnic communities of Africa, major differences can also be observed amongst them, but they are nevertheless not immune to the course of history, and least of all immune to the course of history in Africa. Therefore, whether it is still a latent feeling of nationalism which is present amongst our Bantu people, or whether this will only come to the fore to-morrow or the day after, or only years from now, our Bantu peoples will not be able to escape that flow of nationalism which is a historic thing. Whether this is present already, or whether it is yet to come, they are hoping that they will reach maturity as regards the feeling of being a nation, and also to reach the practical realization thereof in some political system or other. And in our policy we are giving them those materials for that political system.</p>

<p>It is, in addition, an acknowledged fact that the vast majority of Bantu in this country are favourably disposed to and support the policy of the National Party. The Bantu know that we are in earnest about assisting them&#x2014;at the pace at which it is possible for them to accept responsibility&#x2014;along this road, and also the political road, and even along the road leading to full self-realization. They believe, and they have confidence in this Government, that as regards our intentions towards them we are in earnest about helping them along that road. The National Party has never believed in buying the goodwill of the Bantu. Nor does the National Party allow itself to be forced or pushed into the next stage of development, but it has won the goodwill of the Bantu peoples through the sustained implementation of the policy of this party to proceed to the next stage of development when the Government believes that the time is ripe for doing so. But now we know that within the framework of their policy the United Party also want to develop the Bantu territories. In those Bantu territories, or the reserves as they often call them, they want to establish a form of government, and they say this form of government can develop into provincial status and even higher.</p>

<p>The question I now want to ask is just this: The hon. member for Yeoville said it would develop into provincial status and even higher. Now I ask. if this is the case, how would these territories be identified? I want to ask the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) how these territories would be identified. Would they merely be given a geographical description, or would they indicate the territories and say this is the home of the Xhosa and that is the home of the Zulus? Or would they merely indicate, by wind direction, the territory which is situated to the east or to the west? That is the question. Do they deny the existence of these peoples, i.e., that there is no such thing as Xhosas or Zulus or any of the other peoples, and do they begrudge these peoples the right to want to be peoples; and if they begrudge them the right to be peoples, how are they going to grant them, within the framework of their policy, representation in this Parliament?</p>

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make this statement. The United Party is creating a numerically superior non-White group by not recognizing them as separate peoples, because in their policy and according to their remarks last night and the interjections they made, these people are apparently receiving no place and recognition in their policy or in the representations which these people should have. Therefore, this is a numerically superior group, a creation which jeopardizes the position of the white man and other minority groups within that numerically superior group. But I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p>It may also be argued that it is being proposed here to grant citizenship to people who have not yet reached the stage of full self-realization. I want to read out some of the views held by an authority on this subject, i.e. Mr. Werner Bertelsman, the Secretary of the Institute for Foreign and Comparative Law of the University of South Africa. As regards self-determination, he said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is true that the exercise of the right of self-determination need not always imply a change in international boundaries. For instance, where minority peoples prefer, for the time being, to be satisfied with a measure of self-government within the framework of an existing state until such time as they will be better able to stand on their own feet, they are already availing themselves of their right of self-determination.</block>

<p>Therefore, what we are dealing with here, is not an absurdity. If we proceed in accordance with this process and at this pace, then these people are already availing themselves of their right of self-determination within the framework of the present State. Mr. Werner Bertelsman went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the very outset self-determination plays a role in this process and is realized to a great extent when the Bantu homeland obtains at its own request not quite independence, but a constitution and self-government.</block>

<p>This is an authority speaking here, and according to him we are, by granting citizenship in this manner, also giving attention to self-determination. Two very important matters are involved here: the position of the Whites and the position of the non-White peoples. Everything we do here guarantees, on the one hand, <span class="col_1859-1860" refersTo="page_0944"/>the position of the Whites in South Africa and, on the other hand, offers security to the position of the non-White peoples in South Africa. The party sitting over there has a policy of white leadership in an undivided South Africa. We simply cannot see how the Bantu peoples will fit into that pattern and how that pattern will offer security to the position of the Whites. Furthermore, they envisage that this Parliament will be divisible, and once we have started with political integration that integration influence will in due course extend to the social sphere. This legislation is being fought because we are preventing them from carrying out their plan, because we are moving away here from the idea of &#x201C;one fatherland&#x201D;. But the danger exists that it will be impossible for them to retain that one fatherland. Those people whom they are now begrudging citizenship, will eventually take that citizenship themselves and do so in a manner one would not like to describe here. In any case, it will be done in such a manner that the United Party itself will not be able to lift a finger.</p>

<p>By indicating a few of the main guide lines, I have tried to show that this legislation fits into the pattern of our policy and that, after the example of what has already happened in the Transkei, we are doing the right thing by also granting citizenship to other non-White peoples in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal in the course of my speech with the points made by the hon. member for Germiston. At the moment I should like to enter an emphatic protest on behalf of the Opposition for the happening which we had in this House last night. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration appeared before us and made a speech which had so little relation to reality, to the practical realities of South Africa, that we honestly wondered who wrote it. It seemed to me to come from the innermost recesses of a nut house. I honestly cannot see how the hon. the Minister can come to this House with a speech such as the one he made last night. To me it seemed as if he was on a psychedelic trip, floating up in the clouds with rosy rainbow hues all about him and the hon. member for Germiston accompanying him looking down on South Africa while seeing nothing of the reality under which we live in this country. I am unable to understand how the hon. the Minister can come to this House seriously with the type of speech he made last night and pretend that it has any relation to what is going on in our country. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister says he will give his reply, Sir. I say it is time that he came down to the practical reality of what is going on in South Africa. The attitude the Minister, his department and of the Nationalist Party seems to be that if one looks long enough at the Bantu they will all go away. In any event, that is the practical effect of what he said last night, the speech he made concerning the Bantu population. One can come only to one conclusion and that is that the Nationalist Party has been wiped out as far as the practical problems of South Africa are concerned. What did the Minister say? According to him the policy of the Nationalist Party is not that we have a racial problem in South Africa anymore, but a problem of nations, of various national groups of people each one evolving in its own particular homeland. Let me ask the hon. the Minister a question. Say the Zulu people by chance all turn white overnight, what will the Minister&#x2019;s policy be? Will he still insist that they have a homeland of their own?</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>It is about as realistic as the approach of the Minister to this problem. Because if the Zulu should all turn white overnight, what will the hon. the Minister do? Will he still insist that they have a homeland of their own? Or will he simply say that because they are now Whites they now no longer need a homeland? If the Minister says that they still must have a homeland of their own even if they are white, then what about the English-speaking people in this country? What will the Minister&#x2019;s approach be then? On the other hand, if the Minister says they do not need a homeland, then the Minister&#x2019;s policy to-day is based upon colour, because the only reason why they are insisting upon the different peoples in South Africa having separate homelands is because of colour. Despite the spurious reasoning of the hon. the Minister last night, their policy is still based on colour and we still have a racial problem in South Africa, a problem which we have to solve. For the hon. the Minister to turn his back on this problem and attempt by painting pretty pictures in the sky to pretend that it does not exist, shows that he is deluding himself, the entire South Africa and the whole world.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened very carefully. The hon. member for Germiston and other hon. members in other debates reproached the United Party because they said the approach of this Party was. an economic one. But what is history? Surely, what we have seen over the past half century or so is history acting through economics. The struggle and rise of the working class has been the realistic politics of the past 50 years in every nation of the world and to-day is spreading far beyond the confines of Europe. Politics is being used as a political weapon to better the position of the lower classes. Here in South Africa the Bantu spent R4 million a day. You cannot, therefore, simply turn your back on them and pretending that they do not exist by creating for them a political homeland within a framework outside the purview of South African politics. Simply by wanting to send them to a homeland of their own, the Government <span class="col_1861-1862" refersTo="page_0945"/>seems to think that they have solved the problem. Our problem in South Africa is to build a stable political society in one form or another, and this has to be based on democracy. That is the real problem that we have to face in South Africa to-day, i.e. to build a stable political society. It has to be stable. The hon. member for Germiston mentioned in his speech how many countries with a democratic system in the world are not stable. And there is no worse system of Government on earth than an unstable democracy, because it leads to every type of perversion, explotation, dictatorship and that type of thing. What this Government is doing is wishing precisely that form of Government upon the Bantu populations of this country. They do that by attempting to create the sort of homeland which they say they are attempting to create. The hon. member for Germiston was quite plain about it that independence was still the policy of the Nationalist Party, to give independence to the Bantu homelands and to limit their rights to those homelands. But what the Government is doing is that it is creating a situation with eight independent Bantu homelands in South Africa, homelands which, according to the estimate of Professor Tomlinson in 1955, could absorb only 10 million people and even then they have to be developed to their fullest capacity. But we are told that by the end of the century we will have 40 million black people in this country. That means that we will have 30 million non-citizens within white South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, foreigners. We will then have 30 million black non-citizens as against the 8 or 10 million white citizens. Hon. members have accused us of having an economic approach. But, surely to goodness, the pressure from these non-citizens is going to be to attempt to take over the white area in which the whole of their future will, even by the end of the century, still be founded. Why should they persist in accepting the nonsensical theory this Nationalist Party puts forward that they can find in their homelands any kind of a secure and stable future for themselves or their children?</p>

<p>Let us look at the Bill to see what it says. Here we have a Bill which proposes to give citizenship to the Bantu population, to every single Bantu in South Africa. Everyone of these is now going to become a citizen of a foreign country, of their respective homelands. Because citizenship has to be tied to a territory. But what goes with that citizenship? The franchise? It is stated here in the Bill that there shall be a franchise. What about the right of residence? If people who live on my farm are given a certificate to say that they are citizens of a particular portion of Natal, for argument&#x2019;s sake, will they have the right of residence in that homeland? Will they have the right of employment in that homeland? If they are registered on my farm as labourers and they leave and go into the homelands, will they automatically have the right to go into the urban areas and find another form of employment? When they are registered as citizens and come from a homeland, will they receive preference in the white areas? We know that in the Bantu areas, and here I think specially of the Transkei, there is no more land to allocate to people returning from outside, land on the ordinary basis of living in a kraal and have a little piece of ground to cultivate and for the grazing of stock. Already to-day there is in the Transkei no more ground to allocate to strangers returning, to this &#x201C;scattered flock&#x201D; the Minister spoke about, returning from the white areas to their homelands. What is the intention of the Government then? They are creating here a dual system of citizenship, dual nationality, dual loyalty. We have heard that a house which is divided against itself cannot stand. But the Minister here is creating neither flesh nor fowl. He is giving these people a conditional citizenship, a citizenship which does not as yet have any real meaningfulness. This much the Minister himself admitted. These people are still being protected by the laws of South Africa as members of the South African society. But, meanwhile, it is proposed to give them some form of spurious and synthetic citizenship. That then is the answer of the Nationalist Party to the problem of overwhelming numbers of black people in our country&#x2014;they create a synthetic citizenship, a mental apartheid, something which in the minds of all these people must create the impression that they are now citizens of somewhere else; they will then go away and leave us alone here in the white areas. Sir, how will this affect Bantu labour on the farms, for instance? I speak for my own area, the area of the hon. member for Klip River, and also for the bulk of Natal, as well as for certain other areas in the Transvaal, when I say that the relationship between the farmer and his labour has been a family relationship. On my farm we have Bantu families &#x2026;</p>

<p>That is a very good question. Are the members of that hon. member&#x2019;s family his property! On the farms in our area Bantu families have been settled for a hundred years and more. There is a very close and intimate relationship between the white farmer and his family and the Bantu labourer <span class="col_1863-1864" refersTo="page_0946"/>and his family. This is what gives one stability in the countryside. There is a permanent relationship between the white farmers and the Bantu peoples in the countryside who to-day comprise a third of the total Bantu population. Supposing that one now gives such a Bantu on a farm a certificate of citizenship, with his photograph on it. This is now his incwadi! What does that man think? He has now been told that he has been given citizenship of another country, even though his family has lived on this farm for a hundred years. He is now being told that he does not really live there any more and that he now has citizenship somewhere else. Immediately these thoughts will spring to his mind: What is my status? Where am I permanently employed? Can I go there if I want to? Will the Minister tell us that, because such a person now has a certificate of citizenship, he has a right to reside in his homeland?</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister cannot wriggle out of this. This is a practical problem I am putting to him. A farm labourer, a man who has had fixed and stable employment, with his family, for a number of years, is suddenly issued with a certificate. What happens in that person&#x2019;s mind? One immediately cuts the ground from underneath the relationship between the white man and the black man throughout the length and breadth of the farming areas of South Africa, because a doubt exists in that person&#x2019;s mind. What is he going to do?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my Bantu labourers are not in the fortunate position of being able to have four wives each. I think that is really a hypothetical question. We know that on every single farm there is a continual flow of labourers. Sons are born into these families and then leave the farms, but a stable nucleus of that family remains on the farm throughout the generations. This happens on that hon. member&#x2019;s own farm too. There is no need for him to ask me that question. He knows what happens. If a Bantu labourer is issued with a certificate of citizenship of another area, he will immediately wonder whether this is the first step towards dismissal on the part of the white man. We must remember that the white farmer is the government in the eyes of his labour. He is the representative of the white government on the platteland. That is why I attach so much importance to this. The white farmer and the relationship he bears to the Bantu labourer on the platteland is the one stable element in the society of White South Africa which will guarantee the survival of the whtie man in this country. Without the stability of farm labour and without the stability of the position of the white man in the countryside, we are going to have to give way time and time again. I have mentioned this before in this House and I mention it again now. The control of the countryside is the key to the white man&#x2019;s control of South Africa. We in this country are facing the threat which has come from the Communist Chinese that Communist China will inevitably gain control of the world because they will gain control of the countryside. We have seen this happen in country after country, in North Vietnam, in China itself and in South Vietnam to-day. The control of the countryside throttles the towns. Mao Tse Tung himself said that control of the towns and the countryside will give them control of the rural continents of Africa, Asia and Latin America. This sort of law creates a doubt in the minds of the Bantu population permanently resident in the country areas as to what their future status is and what their relationship is with their white employers, a doubt which can lead to the downfall of the one stable element in white society, namely the farming population resident in the countryside which gives control over those vast outlying areas which I believe is absolutely vital to the future of the white man in this country.</p>

<p>Let us come to the homelands. The hon. the Minister says that we will provide citizenship for these people. I believe that citizenship is the ultimate right and it carries the ultimate duty. It was said by the Romans: &#x201C;Dulce et decorum est pro patria more&#x201D;&#x2014;Your ultimate duty is that you must be prepared to die for your country. One of the proudest boasts of St. Paul himself was: &#x201C;Civis Romanus sum&#x201D;&#x2014; I am a citizen of Rome. What are the Government providing for the Bantu in the homelands? Let us ask two simple questions. Supposing that the entire Bantu population decided to go to their homelands, what would happen? The hon. member for Houghton said the other day that they would have to call the army to stop them but it would not help them. In Natal the Zulu homeland consists of so many little pockets and pieces that the whole South African Army could not even block it off entirely. What would happen to White South Africa if the Bantu went to their homelands and stayed there? What would happen to Black South Africa if the Bantu went to their homelands and stayed there?</p>

There are 41,000 opportunities to absorb a population of some 3 million people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they are subsistence farmers. The reality of what is offered to the Bantu population in this Bill is absolutely nothing. It upsets the whole existing relationship between the White and the Black, as I have already said. I believe that it is even more dangerous in that it is attempting to pack back into the Bantu areas a population which they can never absorb. I want to make the point that the Bantu population which the Government are attempting to pack back into the Bantu areas can only become an underprivileged, underfed and discontented proletariat totally divorced from the ground with no connection whatever with the homeland in any practical and real sense. It will be merely a dormitory, a reservoir of labour to go to work in the White areas. All the attempts of the hon. the Minister to develop the Bantu areas as a showplace of his department, at Temba and so on will not be able to bear fruit between now and the end of this century, in 30 years&#x2019; time. What has been necessary during the 21 years that this Government has been in power, is an intensive programme of development. The Government knows perfectly well that when this side of the House first proposed that we should go into the Bantu areas and develop them economically with the white man&#x2019;s private capital and not Government money and with private white initiative, we were called economic colonialists. This is the sort of approach we have from the Government on the other side. [Interjections.]. They say it is quite true.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is now piloting the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Bill through this House. Suppose it is passed by this House, what use is the Government going to make of it? I want to suggest that the only purpose this Bill can possibly serve, is to make propaganda for the Nationalist Party that they think they have found a solution to the problem of the numbers of the Bantu population, living in the white areas. That is all that they can possibly make out of it; because we know perfectly well that the fact that one issues a certificate to a person, does not mean to say that he is going to live in his homeland or that he is going to get any kind of practical benefit at all from having been issued with this certificate. My first impression was that this is merely the tail of the paper tiger, this elaborate structure of laws, of papers and bits and pieces that the Nationalist Party have constructed over 21 years, trying to make apartheid mean something. To-day it has collapsed utterly and completely, crunched under the reality of economics in this country. But when one thinks about it the second time, this is potentially one of the most dangerous bits of legislation that the Government have ever introduced, because this is creating a doubt in the minds of the Bantu population as to what their status is, as to where they might have to reside and what their future might be. We on this side of the House certainly intend to oppose it. I believe any thinking person in South Africa will be against the provisions of this Bill, because it has nothing whatever to offer to the Bantu population. It offers them no future, no security&#x2014;nothing. It destroys what they have now, namely their future and security.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very obvious that there is one respect in which we have very definitely not had any success over the past 22 years. We have not succeeded in bringing home to the Opposition the faintest understanding of what the policy, the direction and the aim of separate development is. I agree that we have not succeeded in doing so. But there is a fine saying which is as follows: &#x201C;Nobody is as dense as those who would not understand, and nobody is as blind as those who would not see.&#x201D; The hon. member for Mooi River who has just resumed his seat, referred here to Vietnam and the conditions there. I want to tell him that it is this kind of legislation and the fact that the National Party with its policy of separate development has been governing this country for the past 22 years, which give us cause to be grateful that we do not have conditions here such as those being experienced in Vietnam. This kind of legislation is precisely aimed at preventing such conditions. We had the contrast here of this hon. member accusing the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development of having made a speech here last night in which he did not take into <span class="col_1867-1868" refersTo="page_0948"/>account the practical realities and politics in South Africa. Immediately after that he indulged in the same thing by asking this hypothetical question, &#x201C;What is the hon. the Minister going to do with these 13 million people if they should turn into Whites overnight?&#x201D; On this hypothetical premise he now bases his argument. Actually, this is what is happening here. It is so hypothetical that one cannot really discuss it. I may as well tell him now that one does not wish them to turn into Whites overnight. The Minister knows this and that is why he is taking the practical realities into account in introducing legislation of this nature in the House of Assembly.</p>

<p>It is also very obvious that up to now in this debate this measure has emphasized, and will do so further, what the actual fundamental differences are between the school of thought of this side of the House&#x2014;and by that I mean the school of thought of the white electorate in South Africa&#x2014;and the school of thought of that side of the House. These differences are fundamental, because this legislation is fundamental to the policy of separate development. Furthermore, it is obvious that that hon. member very clearly revealed in his speech that he has no understanding of the feeling of national pride everybody has.</p>

He also wanted to know what would happen if all the Bantu, having received their citizenship certificates, were to decide to flock back to their homelands to-morrow.</p>

<p>I have read it over and over and the hon. member would be well advised to read it as well, for then he would not have delivered himself of the nonsense he did last night. This Bill answers all the questions the hon. member for Transkei asked here yesterday. I want to ask the hon. member for Mooi River, if he has not done so yet, to take the trouble to have a look at what is being done for the Bantu homelands, and what is being done towards creating viability and what the Bantu have already accomplished there. Then the hon. member should also take the trouble to talk to the Bantu and their leaders. Having done so, he will only receive one answer, one of gratitude for what the Whites are doing there for them, but also the plea that the white man should not let go of their hand before they can stand on their own feet. That is why this hypothetical premise of the hon. member, i.e. what would happen if all of them should go back to-morrow, is quite unrealistic. The hon. member is entitled to adopting a critical attitude towards this matter, but then the hon. member should also be prepared to accept the consequences of an alternative. If all these measures effecting and emphasizing separate development should be repealed or withdrawn, what would happen if the entire non-white population should decide to-morrow, if I may also be hypothetical, to flock from their own territories into the white man&#x2019;s land? How would the hon. member receive and accommodate them here, and what would he do with them here? The hon. member is prepared to argue in one direction only, but he is not prepared to accept the consequences of an alternative, and will not be able to stop this influx either.</p>

<p>I do not wish to dwell any longer on what the hon. member said. In this short session, under the prevailing conditions in South Africa, we have had stormy debates. However, during this short session the House has also been afforded the opportunity of discussing, under much calmer circumstances, a very fine measure, i.e. the one which is before the House at the moment. I regard this as one of the finest pieces of legislation we have ever had the privilege to discuss in this House, and I agree wholeheartedly with what the hon. the Minister said last night. We must avail ourselves of this opportunity to convey to those who drafted this Bill and the explanatory memorandum our congratulations and appreciation which we feel are due to them. These are clear and fine documents, and I think any layman can understand them. I want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Germiston, i.e. that we have to express our appreciation to the hon. the Minister for a very fine speech of which probably all of us can be <span class="col_1869-1870" refersTo="page_0949"/>proud. We are proud that a speech of this nature now forms part of the records of this House, a speech from which it will be possible for many of us, and also hon. members opposite, to procure light in the future. It will be possible for the hon. member for Newton Park to procure light from that speech, because it was so well-thought-out and illuminating that it once again gave us an image of the policy of separate development and the aim of separate development. If the hon. member had listened to it, this speech would also have told him what his task was, not as viewed in a political context, but as viewed in a national context in respect of our relations politics and our relations policy in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, what is more, we on this side of the House regard this measure as forming part of the mandate given to the National Party by the white electorate. We have no alternative but to implement it. This is a man date we did not appropriate to ourselves, but which we received as far back as 1948, and time and again since then. This legislation is, in truth, a logical consequence of the legislation placed on the Statute Book up to now. It is the next step that has to be taken. That is why we shall not shrink from it. I should like to quote from the election manifesto of the National Party as published on 29th March, 1948. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall not allow that hon. member to put me off my stroke. The National Party has never deviated from this policy. It has been implementing that policy systematically. I am proving that the measure before the House at the moment, has been introduced here on the instructions of the electorate who gave us this mandate after this manifesto had been submitted to them. I shall quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It envisages the preservation and the protection of the white population of our country as a purely white race, the preservation and protection of the indigenous race groups as separate national communities with the potential of developing in their own territories into self-sufficient national units, and the cultivation of national pride, selfrespect and mutual respect amongst the various races of this country.</block>

<p>This is a quotation from the election manifesto of the National Party which was published in 1948, before the general election. We may not stand still. The policy of this party and, in particular, the policy of separate development, is a dynamic policy. It is not a thing which can be finalized all at once and then put down Many of us in this House will not see the end of this road. Many of us will not see the realization of this ideal.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>No, many of us will not. The remark that hon. member has just made, is a very petty one. We have a task to perform in this country. We do not only see the people living in South Africa as 18 million people, but we also see the diversity in those people. The diversity we see, is not determined by the colour of the skin. We see a white nation in South Africa, but we also see multi-national non-White nations. This matter was set out very clearly by the hon. the Minister last night when he dealt with it. This is a processs of growth which we have initiated. Each of us must do in our time what there is for us to do. We must do so according to our convictions. On that side of the House there are hon. members, and outside there are people who support them, who believe in this process of growth, who believe in the policy of separate development. Whether they always agree with the methods whereby it is being implemented, is a different matter. But there are people who believe that this separate development is a process of growth which will continue. Even if we shall not see the end of it in our time, we are nevertheless doing what we find to do and what we have to do now. I submit that this Bill, which we are dealing with now, constitutes the task which has been entrusted to us. This is what we have to do now. It fits into the pattern of separate development in such a way that it has to be done now, because it is not an ill-considered policy; it is a well-planned policy.</p>

<p>This Bill which we now want to place on the Statute Book, forms part of that pattern. This policy of separate development is not an entirely unfounded one, as is often being said by those who want to make political propaganda out of it. This policy has become an absolute necessity. It was born out of and stems from a historical background. Any person who wants to take the trouble to go into the historical background of South Africa, will find that the white people and the black people, coming from the North, occupied the southernmost point of Africa almost simultaneously. The white people settled in certain areas and the black people, in turn, settled mainly in other areas. Historically and traditionally it is a fact that they settled in separate areas. In this way, therefore, the occupation brought this about. It brought about much more than only this. The crux of the whole matter is that it resulted in our having a multinational <span class="col_1871-1872" refersTo="page_0950"/>population of 18 million in South Africa to-day. All we seek to do by means of this Bill, is to grant citizenship to each of those various population groups. We are not running away from this problem and we do not regard the population of 18 million as an integrated unit, but we regard the population as a diversity, a differentiation of peoples living together in one country. We are engaged in creating channels along which these inner urges may be channelled, not only physically but also spiritually, in order that we may afford everybody the opportunity of returning to his own territory. It is for this reason that these territorial authorities have been established. In this manner it is possible for us to make any Bantu living in South Africa to-day, a nationally and geographically oriented person. Even if he were to leave his territorial authority area in order to sell his labour here, we would still regard him as a person who is here on a temporary basis only. We do not regard the Bantu as forming a permanent part of an integrated population in South Africa. The day will come when this man will seek a place to rest and will want to exercise his rights and his interests. All of that he can do in his own territory. This legislation makes provision for that. The white man also wants to know who finds himself here in South Africa. In this manner we shall continue to channel away people, physically and spiritually, to their territories in order to give them a character of their own and national identity. Apparently hon. members on the other side of the House do not understand this. That is why we are not only developing the territories, but also, in a systematic manner, the human material that is going to live in those areas. We are preparing the human material so that we may grant it citizenship. Therefore, this Bill emphasizes and recognizes the diversity of multi-nationality in a very real manner and not theoretically only. It also creates for the Bantu new prospects and stimulates them into new directions. We cannot wish these people away from us. They are here, and under the superior leadership of the Whites they can develop themselves and make progress. We are now giving them the opportunity and the potential of developing themselves further.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that separate development, just like this Bantu Homelands Citizenship Bill, is mainly aimed at these three basic things, which are absolutely essential in a country such as South Africa with its multi-national character. In the first place, it seeks to eliminate points of friction which, under present circumstances, can so easily develop. We are eliminating these points of friction here, i.e. by the provisions of this Bill, which are clearly understandable to everybody who is interested in them. In the second place, it seeks to create opportunities. Opportunities and possibilities are in fact being created here for every Bantu in his own national context and in his own territory. He can avail himself of these opportunities there; they are given to him now. I also want to say that he sets great store by his being nationally oriented. He is not as free of ties as is sometimes suggested here. We are confirming this now and creating opportunities for him in his own territory, as a citizen of his own homeland. In the third place, it seeks to accomplish something which is extremely important, i.e. the preservation of a separate identity. In this measure his identity is being guaranteed and ensured; if he is a citizen of that particular homeland, he will know where his and his children&#x2019;s future lies. Mr. Speaker, for as long as the National Party is in power&#x2014;and this is an assurance which we can give to South Africa&#x2014;it will, for the sake and in the interests of all the peoples living within its borders, proceed with legislation of this nature in order to achieve our object, and for as long as we are in power, we shall continue to regulate race relations which can only be to the benefit of all the peoples living within our borders, for it is aimed at, and it will succeed in, guaranteeing South Africa a peaceful co-existence. I said at the beginning that the policy of separate development was a dynamic one. Sir, this House will not be able to close the Statute Books before all the laws required for guaranteeing peaceful co-existence, for creating harmony amongst the peoples of South Africa, have been adopted. We shall, without apologizing to anybody, continue to place legislation on the Statute Book until we, as we see it, have achieved the ultimate object of this policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I will be dealing in the course of my speech with many of the general points made by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad. I want really to turn to the hon. the Minister, to whom I listened with a great deal of attention last night. I might say that if I had closed my eyes I would have imagined that I was listening to his predecessor because he is certainly beginning to make the same sort of noises. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that if he does not look out he will soon begin to look like his predecessor as well. The other evening I was at the cinema and I saw a very jolly little short where the hon. the Minister and his predecessor were enjoying some tribal authority celebration. While tribal maidens and tribal young men were rejoicing around them they were presenting some of the paraphernalia of Office to the tribal authority&#x2014;the robes and staffs of Office. It was a very colourful ceremony indeed. The only thing, of course, is that the hon. the Minister did not get a kaross like his predecessor. Probably the word had got around that he was not a collector! Looking at him carefully&#x2014;and he is very photogenic by the <span class="col_1873-1874" refersTo="page_0951"/>way; I will say that for him right away&#x2014;I saw the same sort of far-away gleam in his eye as he watched all these tribal maidens celebrating the acquisition of tribal autonomy. I saw the same sort of gleam in his eye that used to appear in the eye of Mr. de Wet Nel when he was telling us all those fairy stories about the Africans in the Bantustans with thousands of rands (pounds in those days) stacked away in their mutji, eager to invest in Bantu Investment Corporation projects and so on. This hon. Minister is getting the same sort of gleam in his eye. He certainly had the same sort of gleam in his eye last night when he was telling us all about the joys of nationhood. He waxed lyrical about the pride taken in a separate nationhood by the seven or eight different Bantu nations. Sir, I have heard this sort of talk from the hon. the Minister before. It is usually the sort of argument he uses when he is going to come with his final conclusion, which he has used on previous occasions, that South Africa is not governed by a minority government. That is the sort of argument he uses for overseas consumption. He comes to this conclusion on the ground that the 3&#x00BD; million white people outnumber the Tswana nation, the Zulu nation, the Sotho nation and so on. He says that all those are separate nations. The White nation, of course, which also speaks different languages&#x2014;and he laid great stress last night on the importance of different languages&#x2014;is one nation. South Africa therefore, he says, is ruled by a majority government of the white people because the Africans are split into so many nations.</p>

<p>I doubt whether the hon. the Minister is going to succeed in convincing the outside world with this argument. In fact, I want to point out to him that he first has to convince Matanzima because Matanzima does not believe this sort of thing. He made a statement not so very long ago, on the 31st March, 1969. This appeared in <i>The World</i> which, as you know. Sir, is a newspaper which the Africans read. It reports that when Matanzima was at Sharpeville he had a message for the people; what was the message? He said that &#x201C;the Africans are one nation,&#x201D; and that is heavily underlined. The hon. the Minister first has to convince the Prime Minister of the one African area that has any pretensions to any sort of limited autonomy, that the Africans consist of several nations before he can convince anybody else. He might have convinced some of his more gullible supporters, like the hon. member over there who seldom makes a speech but makes very many interjections.</p>

<p>Sir, while I am on this subject of nationhood, it also strikes me that while the Minister&#x2019;s Bill is all about citizenship, the Minister&#x2019;s speech is all about nationhood and these, of course, are two entirely different concepts although they are both aspects of State membership. They are quite different concepts. I took the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words to heart. He quoted an article which appeared in this book &#x201C;Tydskrif van Hedendaagse Romeins Hollandse Reg&#x201D; and I read the article. It was a very interesting article, but it makes it quite clear that the concept of citizenship and the concept of nationhood are different concepts of State membership.</p>

Of course, the interesting thing is this: The one African territory that has any pretensions to some sort of limited economy, is the Transkei. It is very limited indeed since no laws may be passed which are repugnant to this Central Parliament. It is a very limited autonomy therefore. Only some of the portfolios have been handed over to the Transkei and others are retained here. In any case the Transkei is completely dependent on South Africa for all its finances; so it is a very limited autonomy indeed and even that area can only be governed in the shadow of Proclamation 400.</p>

<p>Well, I am not obsessed with it. I will tell the hon. the Minister what I am obsessed with; I am obsessed with the rule of law. This to me is very important indeed, and when I see a country which still has hanging over it a proclamation like Proclamation 400, which is the very abrogation of the rule of law, I know that things cannot be too good in that country. I use the same argument about South Africa when we hear all this talk about peace and quiet and law and order, and I wonder why it is necessary to have the Draconian laws which this Government has passed in order to maintain law and order, the sort of laws that are not required by any country where there is proper contentment and real peace and quiet. I want to tell the hon. the Minister, if I can get his attention away from the hon. member for Durban (North), that it is too late for South Africa to start making separate nationhoods. South Africa has been in existence for over 300 years, and it is too late now to start making separate nations. It is even too late to try to revert to the South Africa of 50 years ago, which is what the hon. member for, I think, Germiston (District) and the hon. member for Wolmaransstad nostalgically would like to do. They would like to revert to the South Africa of 50 years ago, because then they can say that the African is in the white areas and more particularly in the white urban areas only to provide the necessary labour for the white man, the concept advanced in the year 1922 or 1923 by the Stallard Commission. Sir, lots of things have happened in South Africa since then which makes this concept absolutely untenable. The sort of thing that has happened in South Africa is an industrial revolution&#x2014;just a small thing like an industrial revolution&#x2014;where the Africans are now no longer required only as migratory unskilled workers but for all sorts of semi-skilled machine-operative jobs. Technilogical changes have taken place in South Africa over the last 50 years which make it impossible for us to go back to the conditions of the 1920&#x2019;s. Most important of all, Sir, great sociological changes have taken place in South Africa. To-day we have in this country urban-born Africans of the second and third generation, not the temporary sojourners that the hon. member for Wolmaransstad was talking about this morning but people who have been born in the urban areas and whose children have been born in the urban areas and whose parents have been born in the urban areas.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member on the back bench over there says that they must go back. I do not know how he thinks he is going to make them go back and I do not know what he thinks is going to happen to this country if they do go back. His own standard of living will suffer a very drastic drop indeed. I do not think that the hon. member, however nostalgically he may want the conditions of 50 years ago, is going to be able to reintroduce those conditions in this country. Sir, if one is to be realistic about this, one has only to step outside the House and stand on a street corner in any city in South Africa and watch urban Africans wearing all the trappings of Western civilization, reading our newspapers, listening to transistor radios, listening to the news, and humming modern jazz. Those people do not want to go back and reinstitute tribal systems for themselves. What they yearn for is more of what Western civilization can offer them, because we have brought them into these areas for our own economic uses and here they have stayed. They are now urban people and they do not want to go back to tribal cultures, however much the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development may prefer the tribal African to the urban African. I notice that this is a common thing among South Africans. They much prefer the simple tribal African who is easier to deal with and who is not so cheeky. Well, I am afraid however much hon. members may want to re-establish that condition it is far too late. I want to say this about the hon. member for Wolmaransstad: More so than his Minister, he certainly gave us a very clear interpretation of the objects of this Bill. It is quite clearly part of the softening up process of preparing the ground before the Africans lose whatever remaining <i>de jure</i> rights they may have of permanency in the white areas. They are all to become temporary sojourners and are not going to have any rights of permanency. This is part of the softening up process. This is part of the <i>quid pro quo</i>. This is going to be the ethical explanation when ultimately all the remaining <i>de jure</i> rights are removed from the Africans, not only of those in the urban areas under section 10, but also all the Africans who eventually are going to be moved off the white farms. These people are to be shifted back and there has to be some ethical explanation, and the ethical explanation is that they are citizens of their own Bantustans and therefore they have no rights or claims and can enjoy no privileges in what we are pleased to call white South Africa. That is the invisible part of this Bill, and the invisible part of the Bill, if I may say so, is much more important than the visible part of it, because it is the invisible part of the Bill that ultimately is going to have at least the <i>de jure</i> effect of turning permanently urbanized people into this hideous mass of migratory workers, which involves as it does the man miles travelled, the man hours wasted, the breakup of family life and all the instability which follows in its trail, the sort of people who are so brilliantly described by Professor Hobart Houghton, when he called them &#x201C;the men of two worlds&#x201D;. This Bill provides the ethical justification for that sort of thing. I want to say that in Soweto alone there is a population&#x2014;I mentioned it the other day, but want to remind hon. members of it again&#x2014; more than 2&#x00BD; times the population of Lesotho, and these people are eventually going to be given the status of aliens, despite the fact that <span class="col_1877-1878" refersTo="page_0953"/>many of them have been urban born for the second or third generations.</p>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that, as in the other Bill which the Deputy Minister introduced the other day, this Bill takes no cognizance whatsoever of the administrative difficulties which are involved. Here we have a Bill which will have the effect of giving every African citizenship of one or other of these seven or eight Bantustans, and based, according to a clause of the Bill, on the ethnic origin of the people concerned and on the language they talk. Now, amongst the people I have just mentioned, the Africans in Soweto, there is an enormous degree of intermarriage. They have not married only within their ethnic groups at all. There has been a tremendous amount of intermarriage between those Africans, and many of them talk several Bantu languages. I want to know how the officials are ever going to decide which citizen belongs to which homeland, by virtue of the years and years of ethnic intermixture that has taken place in the urban areas.</p>

<p>I cannot hear what the hon. member is saying and in any case I do not think he knows what he is talking about. But I want to ask the hon. the Minister what the point is of this certificate of citizenship which is bestowed on the Africans in terms of this Bill. What benefits will attach to this document which may&#x2014;they do not have to&#x2014;be obtained? Now I see that an African who has a citizenship certificate will not need an identity card, but since the identity card, as far as I know anyway, is at present incorporated in the registration book that the African still will have to carry, I do not think that has any particular advantage. Is that correct? The African&#x2019;s identity card is incorporated in his registration book.</p>

<p>There is no identity card. I mean, the identity card is incorporated in the registration book. I do not know why the hon. the Minister thought fit to mention that, because I have already read it in the White Paper. But I cannot see the advantage of that. He is still going to have to carry two documents, the registration book which gives all the usual details, which of course determine his whole life when he seeks work and where he lives, etc., and the citizenship certificate is not going to confer any benefits on him at all unless, as was mentioned by an hon. member last night, it may be used as a sort of lever whereby people will either get work or will not get it; in other words, to be able to come back to this House in a year or two and say that so many millions of eager Africans have taken their certificates of citizenship, and the Minister, or the people administering this Act, will make sure that it is only people with citizenship certificates who will get privileges in the way of being allowed to work in the white areas. Other than that, I can see no advantage in these certificates. Even if the African wants to travel abroad, he will still have to be issued with a South African passport, because at present he retains his South African nationality.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston said last night that this Bill flows logically from the Government&#x2019;s policy. Those were the words he used. Well, of course, everything the Government does flows logically from its policy, but there is only one trouble, namely that the whole policy is based on false premises. That is the whole trouble, and of course this way madness lies. The entire policy is based on false premises. It is all part of a wild fantasy, and there is no other way of describing a measure like this which offers people rights and privileges in areas which are not even established as separate nations as yet, areas which many of them have never seen and which many of them will never see, in exchange for enjoying rights and privileges in areas where they live, where they have always lived and where they in all likelihood always will live. One can only call this Bill an anachronism, because it comes far too late. The time is long past when the hon. the Minister can try to forge new nations out of the South African nation, which as I say consists, and always will consist, of millions of people of various race groups. The Bill may satisfy the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s conscience, and it may even satisfy the consciences of some of his followers, those&#x2014;and I do not know how many there are&#x2014;that bother to find any sort of ethical justification for what they are doing to the African people. But I want to tell the hon. the Minister that to the Africans themselves this Bill is nothing but a fraud.</p>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed her seat, has once again proved through her speech that she and her party do not have the faintest understanding or knowledge of the soul of the Bantu in this country. But I want to tell the hon. member for Houghton that we in this country have now become very tired of this continuous usage of the word &#x201C;African&#x201D; on her part and through her Press. We are all &#x201C;Africans&#x201D;, including that hon. member, and it is high time the hon. member learned who is a Bantu and who is not a Bantu. I want to reply to the hon. member at once by quoting what the Bantu themselves are saying about citizenship. This will be the answer to her arguments. Example number one to the hon. member for Houghton, is Bruno <span class="col_1879-1880" refersTo="page_0954"/>Mtolo, who is apparently known to that hon. member, a former communist and a former member of Umkonto we Ziswe, who, having had a change of heart in the course of the Rivonia case, wrote as follows in that particular book of his, &#x201C;The Road to the Left&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It stands to reason that for a long time, perhaps for ever, there will be Zulus working in the white man&#x2019;s cities and on the white man&#x2019;s farms, but the Zulu people will be free and the Zulu government will be able to look after the interests of its citizens working in white South Africa.</block>

<p>It was his pride in being a Zulu which caused this man to repudiate communism. Why not grant him his Zulu citizenship at the present stage, something which the hon. member now begrudges him? Just as is the case with us, it is pride in one&#x2019;s nation&#x2014;be it White, Brown or Black&#x2014;which gives meaning to one&#x2019;s life. I want to mention a second example to the hon. member for Houghton. The policy of separate development is to a large extent the result of our Christian guardianship which has developed, through the Afrikaner nation over the past two centuries of living together with the black man in one country. Let us, in regard to this separate development, consider for a moment, for the purposes of to-day&#x2019;s debate, what the Christianized black man, for whom I as a Christian have the greatest respect, thinks of the granting of citizenship and regaining his own citizenship within the borders of our Republic. I quote from what was written by the Rev. Saul Selepe of Lady Grey in the &#x201C;Kerkbode&#x201D; of 27th September, 1967. In a spontaneous manner he wrote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What I have offered you here &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are his own thoughts on separate development&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; are my convictions as a black man. Birds of a feather flock together, and the natural order of things requires us to develop separately. Through the policy of separate development it is possible for the Bantu to develop into a happy and carefree community, to retain his identity and citizenship and also his language and self-respect and not to become an imitation, third-class white man.</block>

<p>This is what the hon. member for Houghton should like them to be. This Bantu clergyman went on to emphasize the work done by the church in this important sphere. It is this sincere endeavour on the part of the Christianized black man which is so atrociously being rejected by the Opposition, of which the hon. member is a member. It has been proved that the Opposition&#x2019;s interest in the weal and woe of the black man is an opportunistic one, as the hon. member for Germiston rightly said here last night, and only goes as far as the economic aspect is concerned.</p>

<p>But I want to proceed to another statement made by the hon. member for Houghton, and I want to refer her to a report which appeared on the front page of <i>The Star</i> of 17th November, 1966, under a five-column heading. It read: &#x201C;The Call of the Kraal after Fifty-Five Years&#x201D;; and the hon. member would be well advised to read it up. In reading this report, a person who does not know the soul of the Bantu must find the conduct of the Bantu in question incomprehensible, as it will probably seem to the hon. member and the Opposition as well. It is a simple story. After 55 years of uninterrupted, loyal and good service in an urban area&#x2014;perhaps in Houghton with a white family, whose children and grand-children he helped to bring up&#x2014;this Zulu servant announced one day that he was going back to his kraal, that he was going back&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to his small kraal in the gentle hills of Mesinga, near the Tugela, in Zululand.</block>

<p>In addition, he grew a beard for the first time, and <i>The Star</i> wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because he is a man of dignity and position in his kraal and says that if he should return with the smooth face of a boy, his chief would be angry.</block>

<p>This was not written in a National Party newspaper, but in the mouthpiece of the Opposition. But, quite rightly, they gave an accurate description of the soul of the black man, which is different. After a long life of comfort with a rich urban family and the enjoyment of everything within his material reach, he experienced the call of his kraal in his old age. He began to yearn for his people and his traditions. He left behind the white man, the dress and the other trappings of the white man and got his kaross back, the kaross to which the hon. member referred to sneeringly. The article goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now he feels compelled to go home to look after his kraal.</block>

<p>This is the melancolic concluding sentence of the report which looks so strange on the front page of <i>The Star</i>, but it is accurate and it is true.</p>

<p>The hon. member says we have been a multi-racial community from the beginning, but what does history say? The history of the implementation of a separate homeland for the Zulu between the Umzimvubu and the Umtamvuna Rivers, attended with the separate Zulu citizenship in the Republic Natalia, is known to everybody and need not be repeated here as an argument. But what is probably not as well-known to the hon. member for Durban (Point), is the story of one of the tribes of the Tswana people with which it deals. This tribe is the Ba-ma-Tau which in turn is descended <span class="col_1881-1882" refersTo="page_0955"/>from the blood-line of the Bakwena, which was descended from the Baharutsi and formed part of the original large Tswana group of old Kghama. Sir Theophilus Shepstone came across this tribe, i.e. the Ba-ma-Tau&#x2014;of which the hon. member for Durban (Point) knows so much&#x2014;near Potchefstroom in 1880, after they had been driven out of their natural abode by the Matabele. What is interesting, is that under chief Sefanyetso a group of the Ba-ma-Tau, having wondered about a great deal, settled near the Selon River. Incidentally, this river was named after Thebe Maseloane, or Herman Selon. Some of them remained behind in the Potchefstroom area while others settled in the Orange Free State. It is interesting that scattered as they were, these tribesmen nevertheless remained sub-ordinate to Ma-Tau. They retained their citizenship in spite of the fact that their subjects worked amongst the farming community in the Potchefstroom area. This information is recorded in &#x201C;The Short History of the Native Tribes in South Africa&#x201D;, 1905.</p>

<p>In this book the story is also told of the Baphalane who, along with the Ba-bedidi, fled before Mapela. Both of them were of the Bakwena group. They merged into one tribe and, as the Baphalane tribe, they settled near Zeerust. Intermarriage did in fact take place, but this did not lead to the tribal tradition being broken down. In fact, the descendants of the Baphalane adopted the citizenship of that tribe. For the hon. member&#x2019;s information, I may mention that they are still loyal to that tribe to this day.</p>

<p>What did the Opposition Press say about this legislation? I notice that especially the hon. member for Durban (Point) is very talkative. Writing in his political comment column in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 16th March, 1969, Mr. Stanley Uys gave the United Party the recipe for reacting to this Bill. I now want to ask that hon. member why they did not react the way Mr. Uys told them to do. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party should allow the Government, if it wishes, to take all stages of the Bill in one day.</block>

<p>Then we would also have been able to go home sooner. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should wash its hands of the whole measure.</block>

<p>Continuing, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All that would be necessary is for the Leader of the Opposition, Sir De Villiers Graaff, to make a short statement explaining why the United Party was taking the action, and then to sit down and leave the rest to the Government. This is the most effective symbolic way of handling the Bill, I feel, and I earnestly commend this cause to the United Party&#x2019;s leaders.</block>

<p>Why did the leaders of that party not follow the advice of Mr. Stanley Uys? Have you ever seen a better example, Sir, of how the far-leftist tail wants to wag the far-leftist dog?</p>

<p>What did the U.P. leaders have to say about the Bill when it was announced for the first time? The hon. member for Durban (North), who is not present in the House at the moment, stated his views clearly in that same newspaper of 16th March, 1969. It was published as a seven-column article. The pith of his whole argument was contained in the following paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The purpose of a Bill such as the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Bill, as far as I can see, is mainly a psychological one to create such confusion that the average man shrugs his shoulders and opts out of the whole thing.</block>

<p>Why is that hon. member not talking about that this afternoon? Why is he not present in the House? The report states that the hon. member also said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Mitchell pointed out that in the cities, particularly, intertribal marriages were increasing &#x2026;</block>

<p>This argument is the same as the one the hon. member for Houghton has just used&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and children were being born whom it was impossible to classify into any clear ethnic group.</block>

<p>A moment ago I proved from history that this was not the case. This has not happened. According to that hon. member the reason for this legislation is that the Government wants to divert the attention from he fact that, as he calls it, &#x201C;the edifice of apartheid is collapsing&#x201D;. What are the consequences of these views held by the hon. member for Durban (North)? They are that the member is, like his party, shortsighted in respect of the long-term solution of the particular colour problem which the Republic has to contend with. They, on that side of the House, are running away from problems. As usual, everything is approached on a short-term basis. This was very clearly illustrated by the hon. member for Transkei yesterday afternoon. They do this in order to be popular and to catch a few votes of uninformed persons. The further consequence is that the hon. member, like his party and his Press, is deliberately opposing this particularly constructive legislation because it seeks to take the already inherently safe and stable Republic another step nearer to permanent peace and calm and further away from that unrest which the United Party and its Press apparently desires so fervently. They do this in order to be able to say, &#x201C;See there, we told you so!&#x201D; I am glad the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is back in his bench. I am looking forward to hearing what he has to say in regard to the <span class="col_1883-1884" refersTo="page_0956"/>establishment of the Lebua territorial authority, where he was present. It has been obvious for a long time that, in flaming confusion and throwing suspicion on our <i>bona fides</i>, the United Party and in particular, its left wing, sees the opportunity for making progress at the polls. In doing this they are diligently assisted by their Press organs, as mentioned. The further consequence is that the member, like his party, deliberately keeps silent about the fact that this step is merely one of a long series of steps&#x2014;all of which have been known for a long time&#x2014;for implementing the policy of separate development in its entirety. A further consequence is that, in this matter, the hon. member, like his party, deliberately ignores the views of the Bantu themselves. By doing so he has proved once again that to him the Bantu is merely a pawn in the political game of chess. A further consequence is that the lessons taught by the history in this regard are incomprehensible to him and his party.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is what the United Nations Organization itself has to say about these principles. The Opposition, like UNO, will find it difficult to believe that this Bill clearly carries into effect a conclusion arrived at by a UNO seminar on the subject of &#x201C;Multinational Society&#x201D;&#x2014;about which the hon. member for Houghton has so much to say&#x2014;held in Yugoslavia from 8th to 21st June, 1965. I refer here to a UNO document, No. ST/TAO/HR/23, paragraph 111. I shall quote the following passage from it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A number of those taking part in the debate &#x2026;</block>

<p>(Also representatives from Africa)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; drew the attention to the need for protecting ancient values in the developing countries. In the past, many of their inhabitants had been caught in the cross-current of an officially discouraged traditional way of life &#x2026;</block>

<p>(About which the hon. member for Houghton speaks so sneeringly)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and of an alien culture to which they could never fully adjust. To-day therefore every effort had to be made to awaken the masses to the needs of respect for their national or continental nationality, while simultaneously striving for the attainment of modern objectives and the elimination of anachronisms or stultifying superstition. Some of these participants added that the maintenance of indigenous traditions was greatly assisted in their countries by a policy of strengthening tribal institutions, such as the authority of the local chiefs, or by an enlightened codification of customary law.</block>

<p>This is what was said at a UNO seminar. This is not what was said at a National Party congress. Citizenship is one of the corner-stones enabling a people to develop such traditions and culture. Admittedly, the question may be asked whether UNO have not already started politics in its proper perspective. This piece of legislation is one of those which does therefore comply fully with UNO requirements. The only difference is that it was born in this country and specifically worked out for the peoples of this Republic. In spite of what the Opposition is saying, this is an exceptional Bill in our constellation of multi-nationality. It brings with it the finishing touches. It is going to create a spirit of voluntary co-operation amongst the Bantu, for if one&#x2019;s language, one&#x2019;s identity, one&#x2019;s culture and one&#x2019;s citizenship are respected in a tangible manner, one has made a great deal of progress towards gaining permanent goodwill. This is something we should so much like to have in this country.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to follow up on what the hon. member for Pretoria (District) said in his speech, for most of it consisted in any case of quotations from what other people had said. If I had had a tape recorder I could perhaps have recorded as well as he did what was said here. The hon. member said that this side of the House knew nothing about the soul of the Bantu. Is it now the sole prerogative of the hon. member for Pretoria (District) to know something about the soul of the Bantu? Does it differ so much from the soul of the Whites? Then the hon. member also asked why we had not done what Stanley Uys had told us to do. I just want to say to that hon. member that if they allow themselves to be taken in tow by Mr. Piet Cilliers, they must not expect us also to be taken in tow, by Stanley Uys. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, I want to dwell for a moment on the speakers who spoke before that hon. member. In particular I want to begin with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. After that I shall refer to the two hon. members on that side of the House who followed up on what he had said, and who in their speeches displayed the same kind of pattern as he did. They spoke as if they were floating about in space, 120 miles above the earth, at a speed of 17,000 miles per hour, and as if they saw the earth as a whole, as if they had nothing to do with the reality which exists here in the Republic of South Africa. I want to thank the hon. the Minister for having made his Hansard available to me. Unfortunately I received it too late to make all the quotations I wanted to make, but I nevertheless want to refer to a few points raised by the hon. the Minister. I want to agree with the hon. member who a moment ago spoke from this side of the House that the hon. the Minister, during the Second Reading of this Bill, spoke for a long time about the ideological view of the process whereby races become nations, and devoted very little time to the Bill itself. The Minister said, <i>inter alia</i>, yesterday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1885-1886" refersTo="page_0957"/>I should like you to view this matter primarily as a building stone&#x2014;and a cornerstone at that&#x2014;in the process of the development of nations, in which we are still engaged.</block>

<p>Then he continues and states that he regards it as his task &#x201C;to help establish the number of Bantu nations in South Africa as separate distinctive nations and to assist them in their development into proud national and spiritual havens for the members of those nations, no matter how dispersed they were&#x201D;. Sir, these are wonderfully ideological words. I shall come to the implications and the interpretation of these words later on.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister goes much further than this. He says that with this Bill he wants to &#x201C;nurture the slumbering national ethnic feeling&#x201D;. He goes even further and states &#x201C;that the Bantu as such still have their ethnic pride, and that is why it is our duty, the duty of the Whites, to guide them in the process of becoming independent nations with their own identity&#x201D;. He goes further and states that &#x201C;they want to identify the Bantu, so that we can see to what nation they belong&#x201D;. I should like to put a question to the hon. the Minister and the hon. members who spoke after him, i.e. the hon. members for Germiston and Wolmaransstad, who followed such a similar pattern in their speeches. I can see from that that the mantle of the man who is no longer with us, the deceased Prime Minister, who drafted this concept of independent sovereign Bantu peoples, is now being donned by the hon. Minister, Mr. M. C. Botha. As that concept unfolds he is making us feel more and more uneasy, because we see where we are headed with this impossible situation as based on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s pattern. I should like to put a question to the hon. the Minister, and also to the hon. members who spoke after him, who accepted his pattern by using the same words and the same kind of language and who paid homage to the same ideology. They are people who want nothing to do with reality. What on earth lets the hon. the Minister think that it is incumbent upon him and that the mantle has fallen on him to lead the black peoples to nationhood, in view of the fact that they came into this country at the same time as the Whites? We claim for ourselves as Whites the right to establish nationhood for ourselves, with all our different elements. We want to build a white South African nation out of all the different white elements present here. But what is the hon. the Minister saying to the Bantu? When it comes to the Bantu, he wants of identify them, and place them in a stud book. He wants to put clips in their ears so that they have an identity which is different to their South African citizenship. That identity is different to the South African citizenship of the Bantu, although according to this Bill they still retain that citizenship. But the Bantu must also have a citizenship of an independent state which must become their own.</p>

<p>Now I want to state the reverse of this position. We are hearing such a great deal of national loyalty among the Bantu, and the desire in them to have their own nationhood. Sir, if matters had chanced otherwise, or if they should within the foreseeable future chance otherwise, what would the position be? Let us suppose that within the next 10 or 20 years we found ourselves in the same position as Swaziland where, owing to external influences or something which I cannot at this stage predict or do not even want to think about, the majority governs the country. Let us suppose the various Bantu groups inter-married and occupied the whole country. They in their turn would then say: &#x201C;We also want to create a nationhood in the Republic of South Africa. The Whites can get along with 13 or 14 per cent of the land, and we shall keep the rest for ourselves. We now want a Bantu nation here which is peculiar to the Republic of South Africa, but after all, you Whites also originated somewhere. Some of you originated in Holland, some of you originated in England. Some of you are of Jewish extraction, of Scottish extraction or of German extraction. We are now saying to you: The only way in which you will get a vote, and become a member of a nation, is when we allocate your areas to you. We will give you your citizenship in those areas. We will give you a certificate.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Sir, it will not help those hon. members to shake their heads. This is the reverse of the coin. Let us suppose that if this should happen the Bantus would say: To those who speak Afrikaans, and who are of Dutch extraction, we give the Free State. To those who speak English, we give Natal. To the Jews we give the Transvaal. [Interjections.] They, in their turn, if they are in the majority, will probably have the courage of their convictions sufficiently to say to the Coloureds: To you we will give our Western Cape. This is the reverse of the coin, if the majority group were to govern the minority group. They would, under such circumstances, have just as much right to do so as the hon. the Minister is now arrogating to himself, by saying that these people are proud and that they would very much like to have this citizenship. If one has nothing, one will of course want something like that. If the Whites, not as one group, but individually in relationship to a language group from which he stemmed, were to be asked under such circumstances whether he wants something like that and whether he, for example, as a person of Dutch extraction, wants a certain area, with citizenship of that area, what would his reply be? [Interjections.] Sir, that is not the idea. This side of the House is prepared to accept that those people are as anxious to have citizenship of a country in which they are living, and that they are as anxious to achieve nationhood as these Whites would be. How could it be otherwise? Where is the soul which that hon. member spoke of? Will they not in their souls be the same? In this Bill there is not even a definition of what a Bantu is. Mr. Speaker, you will call me to order if I discuss <span class="col_1887-1888" refersTo="page_0958"/>the clauses of the Bill, but in this Bill there is not even a definition of a Bantu.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I be as courteous and say that the hon. the Minister made a fool of himself yesterday already. He did so long before yesterday, but particularly yesterday afternoon with this compartmentization of the Bantu population. Apart from the definition in the first line, mention is made here of a man who has a relationship with an ethnic group, as defined in this clause, by means of a family relationship or a language affinity. Furthermore, I must take it that he may be married with a person from another group or that he can be a cross between an Indian and a Bantu, or between a Bantu and a Coloured, or between a Zulu and a Xhosa, or between a Xhosa and a Swazi, or whatever the relationship may be. But where is the definition which indicates whether he is the Bantu who belongs to a certain ethnic group? Although we have this broad definition of what we think a Bantu is, it surprises me that we even try to force these people into compartments and to say: &#x201C;You belong in that ethnic group because you have a certain nature and because you speak their language. Even if you stem from many generations born here in the Republic, you are still a Xhosa, a Zulu or whatever the case may be.&#x201D; I marvel that we, the minority group, can arrogate to ourselves the right to designate places for the majority group in this country and say that we want to identify them. With identification we want to accept that you are proud that we want to give you a country and that we are giving you citizenship of that country. I want to repeat that if the situation were reversed and we were asked, under the same circumstances, where we would be stateless, whether we wanted this, then we would in the same way have grabbed at the straw in order to say that we have citizenship of a state Where do we get the moral right to do this? The further this policy develops, the more uneasy we become that the whole policy is going in a direction which will eventually make life untenable and indefensible for the Whites here. Do we have the right to do what the hon. the Minister asked at the conclusion of his speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should like to conclude with two probing questions. Firstly, is it really asking too much, when I now make an appeal to the members of this House to accept, also in this case as has in fact been happening throughout the world, the differentiation between the various nations, and to help perfect this measure, which seeks to regulate the differentiation among the Bantu nations?</block>

<p>Where do we come by the differentiation between the Bantu people living in this country and those living in the reserves? That hon. member asked how we wanted to define the areas. He asked whether we were simply going to use the geographic outline which exists at the moment, or whether we were going to use something else as a norm in order to determine that the one is a Xhosa and the other a Zulu? But then I ask myself whether this was not always the case. Has this not been the case for many many years? Do we not have the Ciskei and the Transkei and the Zulu and the Tswana areas? Since when is it necessary to define the borders so definitely, which this Government never wanted to do before, and then to state that in a certain area there are only the citizens of a certain ethnic group? The hon. the Minister then put a second question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we can all co-operate in doing this here, will our actions not be a forceful demonstration to the entire world that we in South Africa are not so much contending with a race problem, but that we are seriously engaged in our task of building nations?</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister is exposing himself here to criticism from the outside world which could be unparalleled. Biting criticism can be levelled at him because, in order to avoid his problems in this country, because he is afraid to face up to the situation as it is, because he does not want to look reality in the face, he is now engaged in creating artificial nations in order to run away from his problems. We must not make any mistake about this, for the outside world will not regard it in any other light. What will cause it to be regarded in another light? Will they really think that this Government is being honest in its attempt to create nations, but nevertheless want to have everything belonging to those nations? For the Government wants the vast majority of those people to be in our employ here in the Republic. If one begins to quote figures in this regard, which has already been done by one of the hon. members in this House, then one finds that by the year 2,000&#x2014;30 short years from to-day&#x2014;there will, by way of a projection. be between 35 and 40 million Bantu. At least 20 million of them will have to live within the Republic as we want to define it. Most of them will be people who would subsequently have been born here, but to whom we have allocated a certificate and citizenship of another place but who are nevertheless working in a white state. This is the tremendous labour force we need for our economy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to reply to the question of the hon. member for Vryheid. Do the Bantu living in his part of the world not have citizenship of the country? Of course they have, and the same applies to the rest of the country. If that hon. member had read the Bill he would have seen that it makes provision for citizenship of a state plus citizenship of the Republic of South Africa and all the obligations which go with that. Then he would soon have realized what the Government meant by this. I want to repeat that those hon. members are living in a dream world. We cannot say it emphatically enough that the hon. the Minister and the people who follow him are living in a dream world. Perhaps we can still shake them out of it? Perhaps they will still descend to the reality of what is happening in this country. What is happening and what will happen here is that we will have to live with 20 million and more Bantu in this country for the next 20, 30 years. We will have to find means other than the ideological means of this Government to deal with them. This Act will cause us boundless difficulty in the future. It will not indemnify us from the criticism of the outside world. We should rather face up to reality and find the best means at our disposal to deal with them while they are here with us in order to give them a feeling of pride in being citizens, or semi-citizens, of the Republic as such, with a patriotic feeling for, and a root, or as the Englishman says, a stake in this Republic. By so doing they can also help defend this country against any kind of aggression, wherever it may come from, instead of being citizens of another state outside our borders.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, honestly&#x2014;and you must believe me, I am an honest man&#x2014;since I have been sitting in this Parliament I have never seen a person so completely lost. The hon. member for East London (City) is completely lost within his own party. Does the hon. member for East London (City) want to tell me that what he expounded here this afternoon is the policy of his party? Surely this is a tragedy taking place here before our eyes. Not only is the hon. member completely lost within his own party, he is also lost within the reality of our South African politics. The hon. member does not have any idea whatsoever of what apartheid or separate development is all about. But he is not only completely lost in his party; he is not only completely lost within our South African politics; he is also a solitary fighter. He is like a lonely, solitary bull fighting history. In politics one may win an election here and there and a few seats here and there and scrape together a few votes, and one may achieve a temporary opportunistic victory, but a man who opposes the course of history, and does so without knowledge, is damned and lost. That hon. member to-day fought a solitary battle against hard, historical facts. The great significance of his speech is that he ignorantly and stubbornly resists one historical fact or more&#x2014;one cannot deprive a people of its right to self-determination. What is this Bill doing? I remember very well that in 1957 I addressed a meeting at Linden in Johannesburg. As is my custom I always ask someone to take notes of what I said. It is always a good thing to read what another man thinks and how he interprets what you say. If I were to-day to read out to that hon. member from minutes of what he once said, he will feel ashamed. In any case, in 1957 I, in all humility, uttered these prophetic words. I said that in spite of all the legislation within our master plan, our master plan for separate development would not be completed before we had a separate citizenship Act. This measure is a confirmation and a re-confirmation of an historical, irrevocable law, namely that without citizenship for the individual, one cannot give shape to a national identity. That is what this Bill is doing. With this we are giving the United Party a terrible blow, a slap in the face. We are giving them a slap in the face as far as their stories about integration are concerned. This Bill will take the course of all the other laws we have placed on the Statute Book. It will follow the same pattern, namely vehement opposition by the United Party, invective and spectres being conjured up. I can mention 20 or 30 of those Bills to hon. members. Eventually they support them or reach that stage where they can no longer withdraw or change them. When this Bill has followed the stipulated pattern of the other laws and neither we nor they can withdraw it, it will no longer be so easy to talk about integration. Then they will have to have another story ready.</p>

<p>What has our party been doing since we came into power? We have, with all our legislation along the road leading to separate development, done one major thing: We have prevented the representatives of the number of Bantu here in our economic sphere within the white country from acquiring legal rights. It is this party which prevented political rights from being granted to Bantu here. It is this party which prevented the Bantu from acquiring proprietary rights within the white country. It is this party which prevented the Bantu from acquiring the right to make investments in the white country and preventing them from obtaining physical control over property and business undertakings. Now this party is preventing the Bantu from acquiring, through their presence in the white areas, citizenship rights together with the Whites in their own <span class="col_1891-1892" refersTo="page_0960"/>country. That is our master plan. That party does not have a master plan. They have nothing which serves as a principle for their policy. A party which does not have a base in principles, which does not have a principial approach or construction, has nothing on which to base a policy which has to be functional. The cardinal difference between this party and that party opposite is that they do not have a master plan, whereas we have. We prevented the presence of the numbers of Bantu in white areas acquiring rights for the Bantu, which would by implication cause areas of friction and chaotic social conditions in future. What we did and what they did not do or did not want us to do, is a cardinal difference between my party and theirs. They refuse to have the Bantu forgo what is on the whites&#x2019; level of authority. They want to draw in the Bantu on the level of authority alongside the Whites. We with our master plan have always guarded against that break-through, and we have succeeded. It is through us that that break-through was unable to take place and that the Bantu do not to-day share power on the same level with the Whites in the white country. A party which has done this, has done everything for South Africa. We may have our minor differences in regard to mealie prices, telephones, roads and trivialities like that. But what is cardinal to the survival of our people, this National Party has done. This party has seen to it that the level of authority of the Whites has remained intact up to now. The significance of this measure to my mind, and I do not even need to read it, is that it is now giving final shape to the great concept of separate development, with this master plan, as this Bill virtually perfects it and what will follow on it, we are making it for that Opposition as a party totally unnecessary to continue to exist as an Opposition in South Africa. As I was listening to the speech made by the hon. member for East London (City), I asked myself whether South Africa could afford any longer to have an Opposition like that. The existence of that party is to-day a political unreality. Could you imagine our having an opposition in South Africa which could speak with one accord to the outside world in regard to what is cardinal to our existence? However, they are the cause, with the kind of speech that hon. member has made to-day, of that whole horde of enemies overseas, with the cordon which they have drawn about us from the UNO right down to black Africa, which are sitting and waiting for a break-through, should that Opposition succeed in taking over the government. With this measure the Opposition is being deprived of a hackneyed story, namely the story that there are now more Bantu in the white areas than there were before, and that this signifies integration. Before I resume my seat, I just want to say that there can be no question of integration if one has four basic things. There can be no question that a Bantu&#x2019;s presence in a white area means integration, because he does not possess four basic things. He does not possess any political rights; he does not have any proprietary rights; he does not have any right to make investments, and he does not possess any citizenship. How can anyone be integrated if he does not possess those four basic rights? The Bantus&#x2019; presence in white areas makes of them at the very most an economically active group of people within the white areas, where they hire out their labour as agreed upon with their employers. I welcome this measure because it is the culminating point of a whole series of legislation which has been piloted through this House over the course of years. These were all component parts of the great master plan of our separate development policy, and these also form an inseparable part of our concept of our relations politics between White and Bantu.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is always very amusing to listen to the hon. member for Carletonville on the few occasions that he does make a speech in this House. I want to say immediately that for that hon. member to talk about the hon. member for East London (City) as a lost soul in the United Party, is really laughable, because if anyone can be described as a lost soul in a party, it is that hon. member. I have been here for about four years and I have not been able to find out yet where that hon. member stands. Every week I hear a different rumour. One minute he is a verkrampte, then he is a verligte and then he is going to be an independent. I therefore think it ill becomes the hon. member to talk about hon. members on this side of the House as being lost souls.</p>

<p>There is not a doubt in my mind that the underlying theme of hon. members opposite has been that this Bill is tied up very closely to the success of separate development in South Africa. The hon. member for Wolmaransstad even went so far as to say that the Bill is fundamental to the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. This comes very strangely from that side of the House, because I want to remind hon. members opposite that after 21 years of so-called separate development, all we have to-day is a complete hotchpotch of unviable Bantustans and a massive tide of would-be black workers streaming into the white areas. This makes me wonder whether the Government is in fact serious about its policy of separate development. It makes one wonder too whether in fact the people who support the Nationalist Party are serious or know anything about separate development. It is very strange to find that Nationalists themselves, and Nationalists of standing, seem to query this. I want to quote very shortly from an interview given by a very highly placed Nationalist, namely Professor Coetzee. I would like hon. members to listen very carefully to this quotation. Professor Coetzee said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Die Afrikanervolk is nie volkome eerhk met homself wanneer hy met elke verkiesing ten gunste van die volkerebeleid van afsonderlike <span class="col_1893-1894" refersTo="page_0961"/> ontwikkeling stem nie. Hy skram weg van die voile implikasies van die beleid omdat hy dit na 21 jaar nog nie verstaan of die werklikheid daarvan wil aanvaar nie. Sosiaal en polities will die Afrikaner die Bantoe ver van hom h&#x00EA;, maar ekonomies moet hy in die agterplaas en kombuis, in die fabriek en in die tuin, op die plaas en in die plaashuis en die kinderkamer wees.</block>

<p>This is just a sample of what people think today. That is why I seriously want to ask if the people who support the Nationalist Party really know what separate development is.</p>

<p>I want to say that the Bill before the House has been in our possession for a number of months. Obviously we have had full opportunity of studying the Bill and of going into the implications of it. Besides the Bill we had a very lengthy analysis of the Bill by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. After studying the Bill and after having listened to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, as well as to the speeches of hon. members on the other side, I have had to ask myself two questions. The first question is whether there is anything in this Bill to justify this Bill being introduced. Secondly I must ask myself whether in fact this Bill contains anything at all that can help a better understanding of race relations in South Africa. I want to say that even after having listened to the pious platitudes that flowed so easily from the lips of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, for example, that this Bill is a milestone along the road of building nations in the Republic, that this Bill would add lustre to the history of South Africa, that this Bill should be regarded as a building stone and a corner stone in the process of the development of nations, I realized that this Bill said very little about citizenship. The hon. member for Houghton pointed this fact out as well. In passing I want to say that if this is to be the hon. Minister&#x2019;s valedictory second-reading speech, as it possibly may be, I believe that it will be remembered, not as a great speech, but as a speech coming from the brain of a person living in a dream world.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am certain that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development will agree with me when I say that once a self-governing Bantu area becomes autonomous, citizens living in that particular area will be given documents which they will obviously use within the borders of the Republic of South Africa If this is true, surely the hon. the Minister is guilty of jumping the gun by wanting to issue documents that would have been issued in any case by the authorities concerned. One must ask why it is necessary to have a Bill that will bring in its wake the need for a new, complex administration, a Bill which will make more unwieldy the bureacratic structure under which we are suffering in South Africa to-day. It would seem to me that despite all the assurances we have had from the Government, this Bill will do nothing but symbolize in a new document that the Government regards all Africans outside the Reserves as aliens. There can be no doubt about it at all that the Government&#x2019;s unrealistic approach to the vital and crucial issue of race relations in South Africa has been stripped of all its trappings and is certainly laid bare by the introduction of this particular Bill. I feel that the Bill is completely meaningless because the Bill provides for giving citizenship to people who are already citizens of South Africa. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government does not realize or does not want to realize that the march of history has made South Africa a multiracial state. To deny this historic fact, as the Government obviously tries to do by introducing legislation of this nature, is to deal in theory and phantasy without any solid foundation.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment examine the process that has led to the introduction of the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Bill. Firstly, the process started with the pretence by the Government that all Africans outside the Reserves were nothing more than labour units and that they were dispensable when their labour in South Africa had ended. There can be no doubt in my mind that this Bill is nothing more than an attempt by the Government to lower the status of the African in South Africa. We then had the phase of the so-called states within a state, or the Bantustan concept. This was an obvious attempt by the Government to clothe the slogan of apartheid in a mantle of respectability and morality. Then we had the latest phase when the hon. the Prime Minister told us that numbers no longer counted in regard to the Africans and that it was only their status and the relationship that counted. Now we have the final phase in the form of this Bill before us in which the hon. the Minister proposes to give citizenship to Africans, Africans who in all probability have never seen a homeland and who certainly have no desire whatsoever to go to such a homeland. Is it then any wonder that the African, and in particular the urban African, regards this Bill with a great deal of suspicion and distrust? I made use of the opportunity during the recess to have discussions with a very good cross-section of intelligent urban Bantu in Johannesburg. I did this because these people are not represented in this House. It is only we, as Members of Parliament, that can vet any legislation which affects their lives. I want to give the hon. the Minister and this Government the assurance that they will not find a single Bantu in South Africa who has learned to think for himself, who will welcome this Bill or who believes that the Bill was designed for his particular benefit. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government, having failed dismally to reduce the large numbers of Africans in the white areas, has now come along with this Bill in order to negate the physical presence of so many non-Whites in the white areas. This is nothing more than a big bluff. I believe too that this Bill as it is to-day should never have come before this House. I believe there are <span class="col_1895-1896" refersTo="page_0962"/>many more important and vital matters that could have been discussed in the time being spent in discussing this particular Bill. I think that the Bill is completely meaningless. I believe the hon. the Minister knows as well as I do that the only type of citizenship that means anything at all, is the type of citizenship that is given to a person by a sovereign independent state. Any other kind of citizenship is not worth the paper it is written on. I feel that we should never have discussed this Bill. I believe the hon. the Minister should never have brought it before this House. I have no hesitation whatsoever in supporting the amendment moved by the hon. member for Transkei, namely that this Bill be read six months from to-day.</p>

<speech by="#de_jager">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. R. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) and I know each other very well, and I regret that it always turns out that we have to cross swords. I can give hon. members the assurance that he is not a bad fellow at all. It is just that he finds himself in bad company there in the United Party.</p>

<p>As I listen to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) and also to the other members of the United Party I come to the conclusion that the United Party has never had enough respect for any citizenship, not even for their own citizenship of the Republic of South Africa. When we wanted to declare South Africa a Republic, they opposed it, because they were not at that stage prepared to be citizens of the Republic. Now they accept the principles of the National Party, as they also accepted many other things, but then they turn around and say that the National Party has in fact taken over these principles from the United Party. The only citizenship the United Party has ever known and for which they ever fought, was the citizenship of Great Britain. In that time they did not even want to grant the Afrikaner his citizenship, for they did not even want to grant him his language rights. Every piece of legislation which was ever tabled in this House and which made it in any way possible for some population group or other of South Africa to go ahead and to develop on its own level so that it could in the long run have a citizenship of its own&#x2014; just think of the Population Registration and our Coloured legislation&#x2014;this United Party has consistently opposed. But this question of citizenship for the various ethnic groups in their various homelands which the United Party is opposing to such an extent, is nothing new. This is a road we have been following for a long time now. The principle of this legislation was laid down as long ago as 1912, 1913 and 1914, and since then the National Party has been following that road until to-day we have arrived at the realization of that ideal. I should like to quote from the 1914 Constitution of the National Party. It appeared in high dutch and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore its object &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the National Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is to grant the Natives the opportunity of developing according to their own natural aptitude and ability.</block>

<p>These are the main features of what was contained in that constitution. To-day it is the final goal of this Government to grant citizenship to these people. The National Party has been following that road consistently. We have been following that trail and we made those promises to every Coloured group in South Africa. We promised each of those groups that they would develop on their own level and according to their own nature and that they would one day be given their own basis. As time passed, we adapted to this. There, in the initial stages of the National Party, when General Hertzog first set foot on this road, he said: &#x201C;South Africa first! &#x201D; We are still following that road, but that road is not only intended for the Whites or for the Afrikaner in South Africa, but for every population group. To every population group it has been said: &#x201C;South Africa first!&#x201D; We are still following that road to-day. Along that road we grant to each his development, his rights and his citizenship in his own sphere.</p>

<p>At least the hon. member for Houghton is honest. She says that this is one common people. The United Party will not state this so explicitly, because they believe that race relations in South Africa is like one pot which is boiling over; it does not matter to which side. Their view is that South Africa shall have one citizenship. for Whites, Blacks Coloureds and Indians. Then they come along in good faith. The hon. member for Houghton stands by and sees to it that the integration which she advocates will happen to me and to others because she knows with her principles and her creed that her kind and her people will not in fact mix with them. The United Party is living in a dream world when they come to those principles of theirs. It is their principle for example to have eight Bantu representatives in this House. as well as a few in the Senate. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) told us a moment ago that he had consulted someone and that these people were not in favour of this citizenship. Surely he will not deny that negotiations are being conducted on Government level with the leaders of these people in regard to this self-government. These people accept it, and this is the way they want it. Did they consult anyone when determining the United Party&#x2019;s policy of Bantu representation in Parliament? Whom did they consult in that regard? What People did they ever consult in regard to their Colour policy? Did they ever consult anyone of those races, or did their proposed policy ever meet with the approval of those race groups? Did they ever find out whether those people were satisfied with it? The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) said that we were living in a dream world. However, the United Party is fast asleep. They consult only themselves and never South Africa. They have never <span class="col_1897-1898" refersTo="page_0963"/>done so and they have never established anything for the population groups of this country. They have never acknowledged this, and in the earlier days of the first National Party Government the National Party had to come up for the group of Afrikaners so that South Africa could also have sovereign independence. This the United Party also opposed. It is the National Party who fought for that group of Afrikaners so that they could have their own language. They opposed the Republic; they opposed the severing of ties with the Commonwealth. They have constantly opposed everything which constituted benefits for some population group or other. That is what they are still doing to-day. When their numbers have dwindled further after this election they will, when these people already have their citizenship, and are satisfied with, say that we have stolen their policy.</p>

<p>This legislation we have before us is as it it were the zenith of our separate development. In 1959 we granted self government to the Bantu. How on earth can an ethnic group have self government, and how on earth can they identify themselves if they cannot recognize their own people? We as citizens of South Africa, and by that I mean the Whites, know where our people are. We know what they are doing and we have control over them. How can there be a state or a population group which must govern itself but does not know where or who its people are? With this legislation of ours it is clear, surely, that these people will come into their own as far as their own survival among their own people is concerned. The United Party would do well to listen to what I am saying now. Do the hon. members know what our guarantee is? Our guarantee is the fact that these people have their own political rights in their own homeland and among their own population group. This guarantees to us something which the United Party has never been able to guarantee, and that will mean their downfall. If they should ever come into power in this country, it will mean the end of the Whites. This legislation makes provision for that, and it is the guarantee to us that the Bantu will never receive any political rights in the white areas in white South Africa. This legislation affords them citizenship in their own homelands and not in our homeland. That is what is so important to us.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked here what this citizenship was worth to these people. I now want to ask them what the citizenship for the same Blacks from Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Malawi is worth to them here among us. They are doing the same work in the white areas as our own Bantu. Surely we can identify them and their countries of origin know where they are and who they are. Precisely the same thing will happen here. The only difference will be that they will in addition receive the guarantee of the protection of their citizenship of the Republic. These other people do not even have it. The population of the entire Africa consist for the most part of Blacks. After all, they are various countries with various Governments, and each inhabitant of each one of those countries has his own citizenship. Does the United Party begrudge these people the pride of having a nation? Do they not want that person to be able to give you that citizenship certificate when you ask him who he is and where he comes from, which shows that he is a Swazi, a Malawi, a Zulu or a Transkeian? Do they not want him to be able to say that a certain territory is his country and that those people are his people? If those hon. members are perhaps not proud of their own citizenship, grant another population group the right to be proud of theirs. That is why this legislation is a milestone and I almost want to say the final milestone in our history of separate development.</p>

We have a provincial system at the present moment in the Republic of South Africa, but does a Transvaler or a Free Stater or a Natallian or a Capetonian, as I am, have separate citizenship? Do we have a dual citizenship in this country? Our views in the various provinces are different; we have other interests, but we have citizenship in South Africa, and we expect that under the system which we offer to the public, to the races and nations in South Africa, this system will also apply in regard to race relations.</p>

<p>That hon. member will be given a chance to speak. Sir, after having made a thorough study of the White Paper on this Bill, two questions arise, and the first question is this: How far must this policy of separate development be allowed to go if it goes hand in hand with this policy of the development of nations towards sovereign independence, which has repeatedly been announced on platforms and in this House and in the Other Place? In his introductory speech the hon. the Minister spoke about a national government for every nation, and only last week in the Other Place the hon. the Minister said, on 5th June&#x2014;&#x201C;our policy is a policy of supremacy (baasskap) for every nation; every nation must be master in its own country&#x201D;. Now I come to the second question which arose here, and it is this: How safe is dual citizenship? And when I put this question, I am coming closer to my part of the world, to the Ciskei and the Transkei. We know that there was mention in the past and that there would be mention in the future of an amalgamation of the Ciskei and Transkei; we know that the Transkei has already received citizenship and that the Ciskei is now going to receive citizenship; we know that it could very easily happen that these two Xhosa-speaking tribes or areas&#x2014;there are various tribes in the area&#x2014;can amalgamate. After 21 years of government and of apartheid and of separate development, the people of the Transkei and the Ciskei&#x2014;I am not speaking only of the Bantu now but also of the Whites&#x2014;did not up to now know precisely what lies ahead for them in those areas in the future. Here, Sir, a question arises for this policy of dual citizenship is the policy which the European countries have been applying during the last few decades in Africa. It was stated here by various members on the opposite side that the European countries withdrew and granted sovereign independence to the states long before they were ripe enough for it. But they could not prevent this. After they had granted them dual citizenship and after they had made the promise, they could not prevent the flood, and with their withdrawal and with their neglect of the responsibilities of the Whites in Africa, they opened the gates of the sluices of chaos and communistic infiltration. During the last few decades we have seen, from the north to the Zambesi in Africa, civil wars. <i>coups d&#x2019;etat</i>, starvation and military controlled one-party states. But the states of which Europe got rid, are all areas far across the sea from the homeland, they are not within the homeland as these areas are which we are now debating, and in that I see a great danger. I am sorry that the hon. the Minister of Defence is not here to-day because I wonder whether the military historians of the Department of Defence were consulted in this matter. You must remember&#x2014;it is also mentioned here&#x2014;that the old Protectorates did in fact receive their freedom from Britain and that no difficulty was experienced with them. But, Sir, these countries are totally surrounded by the Republic of South Africa; they are economically dependent on this state of ours. But the Transkei now to a certain extent has its own government; it has received the promise of self-government and George Matanzima, according to a report in the <i>Express</i> of 23rd November, 1969, talks about a possible army for the Transkei. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The establishment of a Transkeian defence force is a ticklish issue but a definite ultimate aim, and complete independence is the ultimate and inevitable aim.</block>

<p>The difference between the Transkei and the old Protectorates is the following: The Transkei has a coastline.</p>

The Transkei area is along the Indian Ocean. What consultation has there been between our military authorities and our Bantu administrations in this regard? What prevents people, if they have their own citizenship, and their own government, and a promise of sovereign independence, from making a unilateral declaration of independence? That has been done in history. What prevents the Transkei from amalgamating with other States? Sir, I am definitely opposed to this Bill. I agree 100 per cent with the hon. member for Transkei. In conclusion I just want to say that whatever the hon. the Minister does at this stage&#x2014;whether he continues and pushes this Bill through, or whether he withdraws the Bill unconditionally, we will win the election on 22nd April precisely because of this legislation which is now being considered by this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany must excuse me if I do not follow him up here in his incomplete argument. However, I want to invite him to come to my constituency when he is in Pretoria. I have a few first year students there who would not mind exchanging a few ideas with him now and then and giving him a little help where he has lost the trail.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in respect of the citizenship of territorial authorities it is, in the first instance, important to realize that traditionally speaking there were actually no particular rights of citizenship among Bantu people; there was, in fact, the position of a chief and his subjects, bound to that chiefship authority by an obligation of loyalty. A chiefs prestige was built on the number of subjects he had. by the extension thereby given to his authority; the more subjects, the greater the chief, and it was the endeavour to bring people together, in tribal contexts, in the largest possible groups. It is also interesting to realize that although the core of each Bantu tribe consists of people related to the chieftain&#x2019;s line through several generations, there were, however, people present in every Bantu tribe who did not genealogically fall within that chieftain&#x2019;s line; i.e. that as the history of mutual tribal quarrels and conflict developed, people from one tribe broke away in order to link up with another tribe, even though that tribe lived very far away at times. This mutual interchange of individuals between tribes was far greater in extent than we normally realize. To-day it is still discernable in a Kgoro analysis of any tribe that one would care to undertake. However, it is striking that when people sought affiliation within an extraneous tribe like this, it was always within a culturally related tribe. Therefore, in a Tswana tribe one would originally, traditionally, have found a tribal core related to the chieftain&#x2019;s line, but alongside that also a reasonably large number of extraneous groups who came from other Tswana tribes to this respective one&#x2014;in the course of years; but in a Tswana tribe you would not have found a group of people of Venda origins. They were foreigners to them, not only tribally foreign but also culturally foreign. Thus one would find the same thing in the formation of other tribal groups, be it the Venda, the Zulu or whatever other tribe. Mr. Speaker, this matter is important because it points to the fact which we are systematically recognizing in later years, i.e. that among these people there was originally an awareness of the mutual cultural ties which are usually not generally recognized.</p>

<p>In the second place, one must remember that in the homelands to-day a change is taking place in the direction of western culture. This is unavoidable. The Bantu cannot escape the effect of the example set by western culture. When one studies the traditional culture in the homelands, one finds the norms of correct behaviour to be very well known, because they go back to the traditional cultural basis prior to the advent of the Whites. But what is found in practice in the homelands deviates so distinctly from this norm that one is compelled to say that one still knows the norm from one&#x2019;s contact with books, but that owing to changes one cannot recognize this in practice any more. Conversely, in the urban areas, from our studies, we normally only know things as they are in practice, the things that prove that an excessive change took place in the direction of western culture, but we know nothing of the norms that parents in urban areas teach their Bantu children, and this is ignored in studies. However, what does remain fixed is the fact that these norms are still basically Bantu norms. They are ethnic norms. In urban areas it is found that Tswana children are brought up by Tswana parents and Zulu children by Zulu parents. This means that, although a process of westernization has taken place in the homelands as well as in the urban areas, this is perhaps very much more in evidence, and also very much more advanced, in the cities than in the homelands; but there is nevertheless a large ethnic consciousness among people in the urban areas and &#x201D; also in the homelands, by virtue of the territorial authority ties. This is very important, because in the modern circumstances in which we live we can at present make use of that phenomenon as a basis for development. It is a traditional basis which did not have full expression in the past. Thirdly, the traditional expression of political ties has brought this matter to the fore. Traditionally speaking there was never the full political embodiment of ethnic units in the total context, as one finds it now within the context of territorial authorities. For example, the so-called Zulu empire first developed, if one can speak of a point of development, <span class="col_1903-1904" refersTo="page_0966"/>with the advent of the Chaka empire in about 1816, and in the ensuing years Chaka devastated Southern Natal, Northern Natal, South-eastern Transvaal and North-eastern Free State, so that there was a large stretch of territory upon which his authority impinged, but the Zulu territorial core was actually surrounded by a large stretch of burnt earth where nothing could have lived, so that from Durban up to the Umzimkulu in Southern Natal, a distance of 100 miles and even more, there was no human being, animal or maize plant to be found. Yet the sphere of influence of Chaka&#x2019;s kingdom is described as having stretched from the Lebombo in the North to the Umzimkulu in the South and the Drakensberg in the interior. This merging of the Zulus, whom Chaka moulded into one solid unit, was destroyed in 1838 by the advent of the Voortrekkers. The Zulu national consciousness today builds itself, therefore, upon a history of about 18 years, or one or two years more, but not much longer, and it is now interesting to ask what would have happened to the Zulu government under Chaka if the Voortrekkers had not come. The chances that this kingdom would have crumbled, as was the case before Chaka, are actually very clear. But the most important aspect we find in this history is that the Voortrekkers came with a particular philosophy of life, that they made an end to the barbarity upon which Chaka built up his kingdom, and that, by their coming and their actions in subsequent years, they left the Zulu nation a superb ideal to which they can still hanker back to-day and upon which they can also build to their advantage.</p>

<p>I want to mention another great tribal unit, i.e. the Northern Sotho, the Pedi kingdom of the Eastern Transvaal, which was established by chief Thulare in the year 1800. Thulare governed by means of marauding expeditions which he carried out upon the surrounding tribes, subsequently subjecting them to his authority. He did not exterminate them, but they had to pay tribute to him. He and his successors governed at full length and controlled the greatest part of the Eastern Transvaal up to about 1827, when Umzilikazi destroyed them. The final destruction of this kingdom only came about in 1856 with the Sekukuni War. I just want to tell the hon. member there&#x2014;he perhaps does not understand my terminology&#x2014;that what I mean by &#x201C;destroy&#x201D; is what it meant at that time. Therefore, the Northern Sotho image of nationalism has a history covering a mere 56 years. In the ensuing 100 years it was never again restored to its full glory. It is only now, as for the Zulu, that there can be a national expression of that consciousness, and this is being offered firstly, by the territorial authority ties and, secondly, by the linking up of definite citizenship to that ideal which, as I have already indicated, exists in the homelands as well as in the urban areas. On the other hand, one can indicate precisely the same pattern as far as the Venda and also the Shangaan-Tonga are concerned. However, I shall not pursue my discussion of them, but I particularly want to say a few more words about the Tswana. In respect of the Tswana who, according to territorial authority, extend from the district of Bronkhorstspruit in the North to about Kuruman, one must note that they have never had a total political context. In point of fact they came from the Magaliesberg in the north in about the year 1400, about 250 years before the Whites, and those 250 years were, for the Tswana, a period of division, of tearing one another to bits, of conflict and calamity, so that as a result there were small tribes such as the Barolong, the Hurutshe, the Baquena and the Bakgatla, all of them splintered units within the Republic, as well as tribes found in Botswana, such as the Bamangwato, Ngwaketsi and the Baquena. If one now takes a closer look at the large tribal ties among the Tswana, for example the Bamangwato, one notes that the Bamangwato came into being in about the years 1720 to 1730, and they remained in existence up to about 1824, when first Sebetwane and later Umzilikazi knocked them flat and destroyed them, and only in later years did they return to their old dwelling places and try to restore their old glory. They are beyond our borders, but it is, however, a good thing to point out how these people never had great national ties and never gave complete political expression to it. The greatest of these ties that remained in existence was that of the Southern Sotho. In looking at the history of the Southern Sotho we also find that, actually, they were merely bits and pieces that Mashesh gathered together in his mountain stronghold in Lesotho in the year 1822. But their national history also only goes back about 150 years, half of the existence of the Afrikaner nation.</p>

<p>The Transkei is actually a unit without any common political expression. The southern area, the area of the Gcalekas, has much closer Xhosa ties with the tribes of the Ciskei, who are also Xhosas, but through British administration and administrative tie, from the previous century up to to-day, a period of almost 100 years, was brought about, which also found expression in a general consciousness and recognition of a Transkeian context, so that when to-day one places those people in particular relationship, it is, as history goes, not so much of a mistake as some people sometimes think. All this is to point out that the granting of citizenship is an extension from, in the majority of cases, a political-national consciousness for short periods in the past, but above all it is a recognition of a cultural and ethnic tie which is now being given a new dispensation at a higher level than was the case with the old relationship between subject and chief. In the establishment of citizenship, recognition is of course now being accorded by the Whites, in terms of the principle of separate development, to national consciousness which could otherwise only have found expression by way of violence &#x2014;as has been said on occasion, i.e. that the international boundaries in Europe are lines <span class="col_1905-1906" refersTo="page_0967"/>of conflict that have become cold. People living on either side of those boundaries direct their thoughts away from those boundaries. The Frenchman directs his thoughts to Paris and the German to Berlin. The boundary divides them because it was the contact point in conflict between their two peoples and their two cultures in the past. In South Africa we do not have such borders of conflict, because the white man came as an intermediary factor in this crystallization of national entities. That is why the policy of separate development is sometimes referred to by some people as an experiment in nationalism. It cannot be any experiment, because if an experiment in the laboratory does not succeed, one flushes the results down the toilet, but if it fails where people are concerned one has to continue working with the material. We do not experiment in South Africa; we do what we know to be correct, as the past has taught us. It must be remembered that nationalism is a stimulus with two supports. One could describe nationalism as a group of peoples striving towards self-expression, and this means that nationalism, in the first place, reveals itself as a consolidation against an enemy, and therefore one finds that under so-called national endeavour in Africa, one has a large variety of tribal units linked together in a unified front against white colonial authority in particular. Unfortunately, as soon as this common enemy disappears these units evidence a tendency to crumble, as the old conflict elements between the units, which linked together temporarily, once more assume significance. A really significant national sentiment can only continue to exist if it also has a second support, i.e. a common pattern of life, a common culture, common values and common norms. This was also the case in our own history where the losing of a war at the beginning of this century did not entail the destruction of our national consciousness. Those mutual links constitute the core of nationalism. It is this element in respect of the Bantu peoples in South Africa that must be recognized by the Whites, when this cultural linkage is taken as the incentive for the granting of citizenship. On the other hand, the Opposition&#x2019;s argument throughout their debate was built upon the existence of a common Bantu language in South Africa, which, if we must see it as a political entity, will reveal a national expression in the face of a common enemy. In the first instance they will reveal it not only in the face of the Whites on this side of the House, but also in the face of the Whites on the other side of the House. And if the Whites should thereby vanish from South Africa, it means that the only common cultural tie which the remaining Bantu will have is the hundred years of contact they had with Western civilization, and nothing more; and then the old seed, the old differences found between these Bantu groups, will come to the fore again, and I can give you many examples of it.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to say that this legislation is a very good piece of legislation, which is truly a firm cornerstone in the policy of being able to handle the contact situation between Whites and non-Whites, and I very gladly support it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the speech which has been given by the hon. member for Rissik, who has just resumed his seat. One matter which has been highlighted by the address of the hon. member is the conflict which exists in the minds of the Government side in so far as their approach to the Bantu of South Africa is concerned. It is a conflict of ideology based on the national grouping of every person within the boundaries of the Republic of South Africa which conflicts with the realities of the 1970s. It is a conflict of thought which one finds difficult to understand. The historical survey which has been given by the hon. member is interesting. It is interesting as a historical survey of the tribes in South Africa over hundreds of years. But where does his thinking equate itself with the industrial life of 1970? When I listened to some hon. members their concept would appear to be that the Bantu population of South Africa should be utilized during daytime in sophisticated industrial set-ups, using sophisticated modern machinery and telephones, while at night it is expected to go back and use the tom-tom to communicate with his own people. That is what is happening here.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. the Minister said that. I had an opportunity recently through the courtesy of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department to visit one of the homelands. I visited Sibasa and the adjoining homelands. It was a first visit of mine to the Transvaal homelands. I of course knew the Transkei and the other Cape Provincial homelands. When I went there with a view to seeing for myself what was happening under the policy of this Government I want to say immediately that where the Government was able to adapt the Bantu people to the practical aspects of what one might call a Western way of life, they have been highly successful. In so far as the agricultural college and the trade school at Sibasa are concerned, one could not help but be impressed, not only by the degree in which the Bantu were absorbing practical training, but also by the dedication of those who are teaching and working with them. One also found that the Bantu can absorb and were absorbing assistance in so far as soil conservation and farming were concerned. But the pace is the pace of an ox-wagon in so far as the Government is concerned in getting over that training and that self-sufficiency for the Bantu people When one listened to the hon. the Minister in introducing this Bill and in his emphasis on the tribe as the unit, one wondered how on earth that can be done when <span class="col_1907-1908" refersTo="page_0968"/>one comes to modem government. One can deal with a tribe admittedly in its surroundings and in its primitive state. But that is gone in so far as the Government&#x2019;s dealing with these people are concerned. While they want us to accept that the Bantu&#x2019;s whole approach to life is one of primitive tribalism, they themselves in so far as Turfloop, the University College of the North, is concerned, have abandoned their initial approach, namely to provide education within the tribal atmosphere of the Lapa. That is gone. The Government realizes that in 1970 you cannot educate the Bantu within the atmosphere of the Lapa.</p>

There would be lovely small rondavels with a surrounding courtyard in which students could according to tribal custom have their debates and their discussions. In a very short time the Government found that that was not realistic. Now one finds modern buildings at Turfloop. I do not say that it is wrong. I am saying that they are realistic. The student residence is no longer a rondavel with a lapa round it. The residence for the students is a five-storey building. Is that so in order that the students can live according to tribal customs and habits or is it that the Department of Bantu Education has realized that we have to get away from tribal thinking to modern thinking when it comes to the education of the Bantu people. That is what is happening. When it comes to the thinking of the political future of the Bantu people, then all this education, all these facilities and all these three-storeyed libraries must be forgotten and the Bantu must be returned to and stay within the fold of the customs and habits of his ancestors of whom we heard from the hon. member for Rissik. When one notices the inconsistencies of the thinking of the Government in this respect, and when one is asked to accept this type of legislation of tribal nationhood because it is acceptable to the Bantu people, what are the institutions that have been foisted upon them by this very Government? Here again one has seen in person and on the cinema screens the induction of a territorial authority. I do not think anybody can seriously suggest that the induction of a territorial authority is a tribal occasion or a tribal custom. It has all the pomp and ceremony of the opening of a Western parliament. The hon. the Minister is accompanied by high ranking Officers. And what are the symbols handed to them? They are not tribal symbols. They are handed a mace and the robes of Office of the chairman and secretary.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That is just what I am getting to. The hon. member for Pietersburg realizes that. If we accept this legislation, we should be handing out knobkieries. I have no objection to the handing out of the mace. But let the Government be consistent. The only thing that was primitive or tribal that I saw were the gifts of tom-toms and so on which were handed over at the induction ceremony. As far as the institution of a territorial authority is concerned, there is nothing further removed from tribal custom than the very territorial authorities that are being established. Nothing could be further removed from tribal custom than the territorial authorities. I welcome it. I believe that that is right. I believe that we should be doing that and that the people of South Africa of whatever colour or race should be trained and educated as rapidly as possible within our democratic way of thinking. One cannot put the clock back and tell these people that they should not have a South African outlook but a limited tribal outlook. If we are doing that then surely we are building the very basis for conflict within the borders of the South African Republic. That will be the result of emphasizing apartness instead of oneness as citizens of South Africa.</p>

<p>That brings me to the question of this citizenship which is here offered. We as a country have been through a period of evolution in so far as the acquisition of citizenship is concerned. I want to agree with the hon. the Minister when he said during the introduction of the Bill that citizenship is an evolutionary process. I think we in South Africa all know that. We all know the evolutionary process which has brought us now to a state where we have a South African citizenship which is respected and honoured by everybody in South Africa. But during the course of that evolution we had, for instance, the statements that were made, that we do not want citizens who only have one foot in South Africa and who are merely satisfied to exploit South Africa. It was said that we want citizens whose love in the first instance is for South Africa; South Africa first. Those are correct sentiments. But what is this legislation doing? Is this legislation creating citizens of South Africa whose love in the first instance is South Africa and for whom South Africa comes first? Or are we creating citizens who, because of our dependance upon them in the economic life of this country, will be here merely to exploit South Africa for economic benefits that are available to them. We are creating under this legislation a type of citizen who might be equated to that type of person who comes and settles in South Africa, establishes a successful business, has all the benefits of life in South Africa and is roundly condemned by both that side and this side for not taking out South African citizenship <span class="col_1909-1910" refersTo="page_0969"/>and accepting the responsibilities attaching to it.</p>

<p>As the hon. member says this is what is now being manufactured. I in my industry or the industrialist must now have in his factory persons who owe a loyalty, not to South Africa first and South Africa only, but loyal to some territorial authority or independent Bantu state as and when it is established. I want to suggest that the fallacy of this Bill becomes more apparent when one looks at the basis upon which citizenship is to be determined. We in South Africa, as I think in most countries, have citizenship which is based on four fundamentals. Firstly, we are citizens of the State because we are born within the State. Secondly, we are citizens of the State by descent. Our parents are citizens and we become citizens by descent. Then there is a third basis of citizenship, namely registration. Briefly it means that if a person is born outside the Republic of parents who are South African citizens he can become a citizen of South Africa by registration. Fourthly, we had citizenship by naturalization, namely the voluntary act of the immigrant who comes to the country to make his life here and voluntarily applies for naturalization. Those are basic and fundamental approaches to the question of citizenship. But what do we find in the Bill before us? In this Bill we find only one of the generally accepted grounds for citizenship and that is the first one, namely the Bantu persons born within these territorial areas. That is a normally accepted principle, according to the <i>lex soli</i>, as it was called, namely the law that one becomes a citizen of the country in which one is born. But what of the other grounds? Where, in any nation or in any country, is citizenship acquired by domicile, that is to say, mere residence in that country? Does the mere fact that I happen to live in a country make me a citizen of that country? That is what is provided for in terms of this Bill. It contains a concept of law and citizenship which is unheard of in any other part of the world, as far as I am aware. I shall be interested if the Minister can tell me of one country in the world where citizenship is acquired by domicile.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks me: &#x201C;Does it matter?&#x201D; surely, when one is legislating for citizenship, one legislates seriously and not purely on the basis of domicile? I shall indicate later what I think this Government is trying to do under the guise of citizenship.</p>

<p>The third basis upon which citizenship can be determined in terms of this Bill, is if persons speak the Bantu language used in a particular area or belong to an associated linguistic group or speak a dialect of such language. A Bantu linguist now runs the risk of being categorized in any one of the nations of which he speaks the language.</p>

<p>Then we come to the fourth ground of citizenship, which to me is quite unintelligible by any standard. Paragraph 7 (d) of the White Paper (W.P.2&#x2014;&#x2019;70) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Any other Bantu person related to a member of the Bantu population of that area or who has identified himself with a part of such population or who is associated with a part of such population by virtue of his cultural or racial background.</block>

<p>Sir, let us take this to its logical conclusion. If a Zulu who was born in the Western Cape and who lived in Langa found himself in the company of Xhosas with whom he became very friendly, and in the course of generations, they found common interests and took part in the same recreational activities, the Xhosa would immediately run the risk of being a citizen of Zululand and the Zulu would run the risk of being a citizen of the Transkei. One finds it difficult to take seriously the use of the word &#x201C;citizenship&#x201D; in relation to this type of thinking. I can find no reason for a citizenship based on these fallacious grounds. One only exists, and that is of birth, but hon. members know that their great theory of the separate nations will come tumbling to the ground if they have to base Bantu citizenship on birth only.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, the hon. member does not understand me. I said that the Minister, with this Bill, was creating a double citizenship. This is something which was the curse over South Africa&#x2019;s history for many years. It led to strife and difference in this country. We have got over that. Evolution has taken place in that regard in South Africa, We now have a South African nationality and a South African citizenship. This Government is now creating that very same situation by introducing this Bill. [Interjections.] Sir, the Government goes further and creates a worse position than existed before. The double citizenship in earlier years existed because people came together from different countries. But what is the Government doing now? Those who are together must now be separated outwards to create a double citizenship. That is what the Government is doing. I can only think that what the hon. the Minister really wanted to do was to give some further attention to the Population Registration Act. He has now got mixed up with citizenship. As you will realize, Sir, the opening definition defines a Bantu person as being a person who in terms of the Population Registration Act is a Bantu.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to add to the words of warning which have come from this side of the House. This thinking on the part of the Government and this step which is being taken can only do one thing, and that is to hasten the evolution of a nationalism within the black races of South Africa. It will create a tribal nationalism which will grow. Once that evolutionary process is on the move, we shall be hard-put to stop it. We say: Do not let it start. Let us realize that these people, as they are part of the economy of South Africa, are also a part of the population of South Africa, and they owe a loyalty to South Africa and not to these created homelands and territorial authorities which are the obsession of this Government.</p>

<speech by="#herman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I tried to listen attentively to the arguments of hon. members opposite, inasmuch as it is possible to do so in practice. I must come to the conclusion that one of two facts is true. Either those hon. members did not study the Bill properly, or, in the second place, they do not have much of an understanding of what it contains. This reminds me of the anecdote the hon. member for Middelland told here the other day about the old days when Bills were read as many as eight times. I wondered whether this was not still necessary for the members on that side of the House, so that they could at least understand something. It was very clear from the hon. member for Green Point&#x2019;s argument that he fails to appreciate the basis of this entire Bill. We proceed from the standpoint of the multi-national composition of peoples in the Republic of South Africa. Previous speakers on that side of the House also lost sight of the fact that we are dealing with the multi-nationality of the inhabitants of this country.</p>

<p>Sir, in 1948 the National Party came into power with a very unequivocal mandate. This mandate was to apply apartheid, or separate development, or multi-national development, in this country. It is just as well that we came into power in time to implement that policy. Now one asks oneself what the word &#x201C;separate&#x201D; means. Separate from who or what? We have many peoples here in the Republic and those peoples cannot all be assimilated. They are all different peoples and one must recognize them as such. The National Party recognizes the diversity of the peoples here in our country, in contrast to the United Party, as they have proved once more in their yellow booklet. They speak of a federation of communities in which each race group must obtain representation in Parliament. That concept of race groups, as they put it, is actually very vague and confusing. It is surely a law of nature that people should try to be a part of their own people, and to be like their own people. We all know the Bantu. The Bantu is an emotional type of person. He also has certain urges in him and one must recognize those urges. He wants to be a member of a people just as we all want to be members of a people. However, the term &#x201C;citizenship&#x201D; has thus far been foreign to the Bantu. Although he inherently felt that he was a member and a citizen of a particular group, that term was still foreign to him. There had to be a gradual process of education in order to bring this term and these concepts home to him. This is also one of the points that hon. members opposite do not notice.</p>

<p>When we think of the two concepts, citizenship and people, we must remember that these two concepts are actually inseparably linked. When one speaks of a citizen one immediately thinks of a people and when one thinks of a people one immediately thinks of the citizens of that people. In order to be a citizen of a people one must first recognize that that people exists. There are various requirements that must be met when one gives recognition to a people and to citizenship. In the first place one thinks of the fact that a people and the citizens of a people must be aware of their own independence. The various Bantu peoples have already proved this during the previous centuries. They have their own languages, their own morals, their own customs and everything that goes with that. In the second place there must also be systematic co-operation towards a <span class="col_1913-1914" refersTo="page_0971"/>common goal. There must be a common aim among those compatriots. When people no longer value their ethnic ties so highly, in other words, if they do not associate them with citizenship, then it has actually become dangerous for that people, and not only for that people but also for its neighbouring peoples. Thirdly, we also involuntarily think of the fact that a people can only become an independent people if it is a certain kind of people and is at a particular stage of development.</p>

<p>What is actually very important for a people and the citizens of that people, is that they should be aware of a natural environment. Together they must have experienced those natural stimuli. They must have experienced them together and counteracted them together, because in that way they are more closely bound to one another, to a people and the citizens of that people. The more a people developes a national self-awareness, the more will the people actually initiate co-operative undertakings. The citizens of a people are actually very closely linked together when those citizens clash with the members of another people. In speaking here of a clash, I do not actually mean a clash on a battlefield. It could be a clash in many spheres. Just as the feeling of individuality of a people is developed by that so will the feeling of individuality of each citizen be further developed by it. The continual conflict among the various peoples has helped to preserve that purity of their race and to bind those citizens more closely together. Instead of further deviation taking place in respect of citizens who have deviated, or are in the process of deviating, they are now called up once more by their own people to form a common bulwark against the influences of other peoples, and that is why I speak of the mutual clashes of the peoples. The citizens must not be imitators of other peoples. They must be supporters of their own people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I also want to mention the ethical basis which binds the citizens of a people closer together. This is the moral struggle of a self-conscious people which strives with moral integrity to eliminate everything that is detrimental to the forming of that people&#x2019;s character. Only when each Bantu person in the homelands and in the Republic sees that he can best fulfil his calling in striving to be a citizen of his own people, not striving to be a citizen of another people or perhaps striving to be a white man, can he fulfil his calling to the best of his ability. If he will strive to be a citizen of his own people, racial hatred and unwilling servitude will eventually disappear and make room for moral individuality. They will then imbue their white compatriots with greater respect, and only then will friction and suspicion make room for cooperation and respect. Every citizen must have a national self respect which lies in the appreciation and development of an individual language. It is very important, and this is where each citizen will benefit by obtaining citizenship within his own people. They must develop an individual literature and culture and they must thereby be able to repeat their national legends, national anecdotes, folklore and deeds of heroism from generation to generation. This is also why the continuity and the recollection of their life history is so important. Without a certain measure of continuity in their actions, customs and traditions from generation to generation, such a group of people eventually easily disintegrates into separate little groups. We must try to avoid that in respect of those people. There must be a memory among these people. This memory must be there to transfer their history from generation to generation. A person cannot actually become nationally self-conscious if there is nothing from which to become nationally self-conscious. There are also other factors which bind citizens more closely together. We think of economic, intellectual and aesthetic motives which are all coupled to that.</p>

<p>The granting of citizenship to the various Bantu peoples within the Republic contributes a great deal to the finishing touches of the policy we began with in 1948. When one considers all the requirements, the necessary pride and self-respect will be cultivated in those Bantu in order to extend that citizenship for them, as is expected of every people. On the other hand we know that before 1948 the United Party was moving on a very shaky foundation. If the National Party had not come into power in 1948 I wonder what chaos would have developed, had we not intervened to put everything right again. Everything would have drifted, because the United Party had the policy of &#x201C;letting things slide&#x201D;, a mixing of the races which would have made it difficult to raise the cultural level of every people and every member of every people in this country. The granting of citizenship will now actually be an inspiration and an incentive for the Bantu to co-operate in their own interests and in the interests of the Whites in this country and to build towards a common goal. The United Party had the policy of &#x201C;let things develop&#x201D;, and this is also how it is stated in their booklet. One reads it very clearly there. This would have led to the resistance of the Bantu, beginning to weaken, and the resistance of their neighbours would also have begun to weaken. This would have been to the detriment of all the Bantu peoples and of the white people here in the Republic. In order to lay this citizenship legislation before the House today, it was necessary for the National Party to have taken this course, step by step, since 1948. Everything fits together like a large jigzaw puzzle. In now looking at the parts again, we shall see that this picture is fast beginning to take shape. Perhaps by the end of the century this puzzle will have been completed, and the Opposition will join us in reaping the benefits of this policy of separate development.</p>

<p>Over the past 22 years we have already had, before this House, several pieces of legislation that have led to this important legislation of <span class="col_1915-1916" refersTo="page_0972"/>to-day. We call to mind the Population Registration Act, an extremely important Act; the ethnic classification of people, the passbook system, tribal authorities, the clearing up of the slums or the slum residential areas and the Bantu townships that developed. Everything led to this important legislation before the House to-day. We also think of the border areas development, the Promotion of the Economic Development of Bantu Homelands Act. These are extremely important pieces of legislation. I also call to mind the funds created by the establishment of the Bantu Investment Corporation and the Xhosa Development Corporation. This is important legislation which made it possible to give those citizens the necessary self-respect to work for the benefit of their own people. However, for that purpose legislation such as the abolition of Native representation in this House, and the establishment of separate universities for the various non-White peoples, was also necessary. Everything formed a part of the policy of the National Party. We must take note of these very important words of Dr. Verwoerd (Hansard 1962 Column 70 and 71)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ultimately separate states must be created for the groups which originally settled here and the greatest possible degree of governmental separation must be given to the groups which have grown up in our midst.</block>

<p>They can obtain this greatest possible degree of governmental separation by appointing their own people there to govern them and to implement their legislation. That is why we have already recorded the system of Bantu law and custom throughout the years, so that they can apply it. Now the Bantu are there to apply their own administration. They choose their own people from their homelands and from their own citizens in the white area to continue their development on the basis which I have now outlined here to the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would have thought that the hon. member for Potgietersrust could take comfort from the history of the Afrikaner people themselves. The hon. member pleads for this measure and this whole policy because, he says, in this way we will be able to create &#x201C;die nodige trots en selfrespek by die Bantoevolkere&#x201D;. They will be able to have their own culture, ideas and selfrespect. But, Sir, the Afrikaner people see themselves&#x2014;the Nationalist Party vision certainly does&#x2014;as a separate people, apart, with their own culture, traditions, way of life and everything else; but they are living in a country at least with their English fellow countrymen, the Coloured and the Indian people. They do not each have their own homeland. Why are hon. members so insistent that this is necessary in order that these Native peoples should be able to have their &#x201C;eie nasietrots&#x201D; and so forth. It will be perfectly possible for them, indeed, under the United Party policy. They will be recognized as separate ethnic groups. They will be recognized as separate ethnic groups in the homogeneous areas which they occupy. There will be no attempt to break down their differences as they are. This may occur with the passage of time, but they will be as free as the Afrikaner people are to maintain their own identity in this country of many people. This whole approach of the hon. member for Potgietersrust lies at the very foundation of so much that has been argued from the opposite side.</p>

<p>This measure is obviously a further step in the Government&#x2019;s policy. I belive it is more a theoretical step than a practical one and has far greater theoretical significance than it will have practical significance. But it is basically a step on the road to sovereign independent states, which is in accord with the Government&#x2019;s policy. I have no doubt that within the bounds of the possible, they will attempt to give effect to this and take us a stage nearer to sovereign independent states. It is interesting to note the following. We have come to know that we get these measures from the Government in pairs. This is the one part of the pair. The other one was the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill, which we have just passed. The Bantu Laws Amendment Bill, of course, on its very face, and everything about it, shows that it amounts virtually to a deprivation of the rights of the Native peoples in this so-called white part of South Africa. This, in turn, is meant to be the <i>quid pro quo</i> which they get. What do they get? They get a certificate, which will probably confuse anyone who attempts to read it, with very few exceptions. As the hon. member for Mooi River said, it will probably lead to considerable unsettlement. This measure will clearly cost a good deal. It will undoubtedly overload our Civil Service, which is already overloaded. I believe that there will be grave unsettling of the traditional peace quiet and <i>status quo</i> as a result. It is a further step towards sovereign independence. We have sketched very clearly and truly the dangers that there are at the end of this road. We remember how Dr. Verwoerd told us in this House that these states would be entitled to have their own armies, that they would be able to make treaties with whom they please, whether they were communists or not, and it would be no concern of ours. When one realizes that this was the thought of the conceiver of this policy, one also realizes how he failed to appreciate how extensive the communist danger was and was going to become. In this period of time the Government is much more aware of those dangers than then. But they are prepared to go forward despite these known dangers. They are prepared to move towards independence at a time when we know the great mass of the citizens of these territories will be outside their so-called homelands.</p>

<p>I think it is time again that we stood still and examined whether there are present any of the basic necessities for success of this policy, whether there is a sufficient foundation laid for them to have any hope that it could <span class="col_1917-1918" refersTo="page_0973"/>succeed. I believe the answer is clearly &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I should like to deal with this question under three heads. Do we have or can we hope to have in future a sufficient territorial separation? Secondly, can we win the non-reserve Native, as well as the reserve Native for this particular idea? And thirdly, do the reserves provide a sufficient national home, a sufficient area of land for this purpose? Let me say that the first two, particularly, are the criteria which are laid down by thinking Nationalists in regard to this policy and its hope for the future. Then I should like to deal shortly with alternatives to this policy. First there is the question whether we have or can hope for a sufficient territorial separation. Everyone must concede that this is a basic question. The Government themselves appreciate that you have to have a certain degree of separation before anything of this kind can have validity. Thus, in regard to the Coloured people, they say that the question of homelands is out. There is much too much interlocking or &#x201C;ineenstrengeling&#x201D; or whatever word one uses. There is much too great a mixing of the people on the particular piece of land which is South Africa in regard to the Coloureds. We know this is so. In the United Kingdom there are English, Scots, Welsh and Irish, particularly English, Welsh and Scots. They are so intermingled that nobody ever seriously thinks that they should become completely independent sovereign states. Occasionally one finds a person or two with an aberration of nationalism, and a bit of pressure in that direction, but it very soon evaporates before the hard fact of the way the people are disposed upon the land which is the United Kingdom. And so, in regard to the Coloureds, even the Government can see that this is not possible. I think they can see this as far as the Coloured people are concerned. There is no need even to speak of it in regard to the English-speaking people of South Africa. This is clearly a very basic aspect, when one is considering establishing nation states. It is interesting to find that the Nationalists have been very divided on how great a degree of separation is needed. I now speak of territorial separation. There is the well-known approach of Dr. Verwoerd at the time of the White Paper on the Tomlinson Report that parity would be necessary at the end of the century. We have had the statement from a man like Dr. Geyer some years ago that the Native reserves should at least be able to take up half of their peoples. His statement reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">If the economy of the white man can in fact not manage without the mass of Native workers: if their numbers in the cities cannot be drastically decreased and if the Native homelands cannot carry even half of the population so that more than half will have to work and live among the Whites, then there will be a question in regard to separate development to which a reply has not yet been given.</block>

<p>This was said by Dr. A. L. Geyer as Chairman of SABRA in 1963. We know that wrestling with this problem other speakers on the Government side have said that numbers were immaterial. How well do we remember the former hon. member for Heilbron telling us &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to develop the point that we are considering here the basic questions for success of this whole step which we are taking, namely to give citizenship to these people, and I maintain that there is not a sufficient basis for separate citizenship. If I am careful, I hope you will be tolerant with me. We remember that the former hon. member for Heilbron said that whether there were 5,000, 50,000 or 5 million people in the white areas it did not matter as long as one accepted their policy. In other words, if one only has regard to the citizenship aspect one sees that they were going to give citizenship to these people, no matter how many were in the white areas. If that was done, they argued, no more would be needed. One wonders if that was so, why indeed was there any effort to get these people back to the reserve areas. One realizes that when that effort is being made, they know that you have to get a certain ratio of physical separation for this policy to make sense. We would like to know from the hon. the Minister what ratio does he consider in the present time is necessary so that there shall be a possibility that this idea of separate nation states can work? We know how the figures have been running completely against the hopes of the Nationalist Party and we know how to-day the forecast is that there will be 25 million to 30 million Bantu in the white areas at the end of the century. This question of whether we are too interlocked in a country to make an attempt at establishing separate nation states completely abortive is a most important one. It is one which I suggest the facts of the situation quite clearly answer against the policies of this Government.</p>

<p>I now come to the second question to test whether this policy has any future. This question is whether the non-reserve Natives can be won for this idea. The hon. the Minister, in his speech at Potchefstroom in March, 1969, indicated a new emphasis in Government policy. He said in effect that it was rather the process of &#x201C;ontvoogding&#x201D;, the removal of trusteeship, and the anchoring of these people to their <span class="col_1919-1920" refersTo="page_0974"/>homelands which was vital and which was the main point. He put it this way:</p>

<block name="quote">Die kern en wese van die beleid l&#x00EA; dus nie in die eerste instansie in die skouspelagtige verwydering van mense na hulle onderskeie tuislande toe nie, maar in die proses van ontvoogding van die Bantoevolke en hul tradisionele geestelike en politieke verankering aan hulle tuislande.</block>

<p>He therefore clearly stated that to be an absolutely fundamental point for the success of his policy. What do we find in that regard? We have had the testimony of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) that many thinking Natives in Johannesburg have no interest in this idea of the homelands. We know that there have been statements from the Advisory Board of Soweto in the past that they believe they will be in Soweto until doomsday. This can be said of all the other 8 or 9 million Natives in the white area. I want to quote to-day the testimony of somebody that the hon. the Minister will be more inclined to accept than that which I have so far quoted, namely that of a supporter of his policy, Dr. Rhoodie. Dr. Rhoodie, in his book &#x201C;Apartheid en Partnership&#x201D; at page 331, says the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Dit kan nie ontken word nie dat die verstedelikte Bantoe in toenemende mate onverskillig begin staan teenoor die idee van selfbesturende etniese enklaves versprei oor Suid-Afrika.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Algoa says that that is what they want to prevent, but what I am saying is that in fact the urbanized Natives are not interested in these states to be established. I am citing to him the fact that an expert in this field and a supporter of his way of thinking comes sadly to the conclusion that the urban Native in increasing measure is indifferent towards the idea of self-governing ethnic enclaves spread over South Africa. I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">Baie vereenselwig eitniese eksklusiwiteit met &#x2019;n arga&#x00EF;stiese, primitiewe stambestaan. Diesulkes verkies dan ook die materi&#x00EB;le voordele van &#x2019;n ras-ge&#x00EF;ntegreerde Suid-Afrika bo die korttermynpolitieke voordele van &#x2019;n gebalkaniseerde Suid-Afrika. Hierdie verwerping van tradisionalisme en etnosentriese politieke ontwikkeling deur so baie van die verstedelikite Bantoes is deel van &#x2019;n verskynsel wat ons vandag dwarsdeur Swart Afrika aantref.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, now the hon. member for Algoa says: &#x201C;Yes, this is what we want to prevent.&#x201D; They want to prevent it. However, we as realists must consider what the chances are of their being able to prevent it. What are their chances of being able to win these people for the idea of these distant Bantustans to be? I believe that if the hon. member for Algoa and other members on that side of the House will reflect seriously, they will realize that they are fighting a losing battle here. The fact is &#x2026;</p>

<p>I say it on my own knowledge. But I say it above all on the authority of Dr. Rhoodie. Indeed, I believe this is the experience of all observers. We know how the European tends to leave the platteland and tends to come into the towns. Once he is in the towns it is pretty difficult to shift him out again. He may have a certain sentimental affection for the farm and the country life, but one will not be able to move him out. He becomes another man in the cities. I think exactly the same process is occurring in regard to our Native people. They are moving into the towns. I believe they find the towns much more attractive places. First of all, they receive far better rates of pay in the towns. They can therefore, live on a higher standard. The bright lights attract the Native people just as they attract us and our wives.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I make these statements on certain authorities including the authority of Dr. Rhoodie. I ask hon. members opposite who are unbelieving, including the hon. member for Brakpan, how many traders have they been able to persuade to go back to these areas? One can count them on the fingers of one&#x2019;s hand. How many doctors want to go back to these areas? One can count them on the fingers of one&#x2019;s hands. Perhaps the traders particularly, get a few favourable commercial opportunities there. However, hon. members on that side of the House would have as much knowledge as anybody else of the difficulty of persuading people to go back Jo the platteland.</p>

<p>Another point which is important in discovering whether these people can be won for these Bantustans to be, is the material advantages to which Dr. Rhoodie refers in his book. The material advantages of remaining linked to South Africa, in a federal system maybe, are far greater for these people than it can ever be when they are in an independent State <span class="col_1921-1922" refersTo="page_0975"/>in the future. The material advantages are so much greater that I can honestly not accept that a man in his senses will want to forgo those for the chance to be able to return to a homeland which he probably will not live in most of the time. Let it not be thought that the Native peoples of these reserves themselves are completely in favour of this policy. What we have heard of the statements of Native leaders in those very areas is that they accept what is being offered them. However, they want much more. They differ very, very greatly with many aspects of Government policy. They want to be able to have the right to come in to work. They want to have ownership there. They are opposed to the endorsing back. It is quite incorrect for hon. members opposite to claim that the reserve Native has been won for this policy.</p>

<p>My third point of test is whether the reserves can be said to provide a sufficient national home or base upon which to raise a nation? The Transkei is a fairly solid unit. I would think that there is a sufficiently solid base for that purpose. However, in regard to the others, if one looks at them, one gets the impression that they are looselying areas to a large extent. I should also like to cite the testimony of another expert in this regard, no less a person than Professor J. H. Moolman. Professor Moolman was a member of the Tomlinson Commission. This is what he said when he spoke to the SABRA Conference in October, 1967:</p>

<block name="quote">Die and er gebiede &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is to say other than the Transkei&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is so gebroke dat dit haas onmoontlik is om suksesvolle nasiestate daarop te bou. En ons baat niks daarby deur dit te probeer ignoreer nie.</block>

<p>Therefore, in my opinion, we have the fact that the very foundations are not present for a further step forward. The very foundations for adequate physical separation, the attitude of mind and willingness to accept these Bantustans, and the very territorial base upon which a State is meant to rise, are not present. I say in all seriousness that this is time to call a halt and to think again.</p>

<p>One realizes the Government is on the eve of an election. One realizes that the Government has not so far been prepared to see matters in a different light. One realizes that this is obviously a step in their general direction towards sovereign independence. However, I do not believe there is any enthusiasm for this measure on that side of the House. I did not see those benches in the House packed when the hon. the Minister rose to announce what he claimed was a far-reaching step. I do not believe that this measure will get much prominence from our friends opposite in this election.</p>

<p>In this connection I want to call in evidence the testimony of Dawie of <i>Die Burger</i>. I do not have a cutting of that particular article with me, but I hope hon. members opposite who may have seen this, will confirm what I say. Dawie, not so long ago, said that there was a definite reluctance on the part of Nationalists to state at their public meetings their conception, their policy for race relations in South Africa. He said that it is very seldom that a member makes a full statement of the Nationalist&#x2019;s race relations policy when he is speaking to his electors and the public. This, I believe, is true. One never hears them stating it in full in the way that one finds United Party people stating their policy.</p>

<p>I now, very briefly, come to the question of the alternatives. I say at once that if any hon. member opposite thinks that we wish to eliminate all differences, they are quite wrong. We accept that there are considerable differences, not only as far as the four main groups in South Africa are concerned, but also as far as the Native group is concerned. And we accept that these differences will continue. We also, of course, accept that there will have to be growing self-government for these reserve areas, these Bantustans to be. Indeed, it is particularly simple to allow self-government in a homogeneous black area. We will certainly follow that policy and, as it has been stated here, it will be extended to provincial powers or may be beyond that. This all forms part of our idea of a federation to handle the future South Africa. It shall be a federation with a central parliament which will hold the control of affairs. Hon. members opposite are apt to say that this means integration. They throw up their hands in the air. Let us talk straight to each other on the subject of these terms. When the hon. members opposite stood for separate representation for the Coloured people in this House, it was called separation. Now, when we stand for it, it is called integration. I can give them some encouraging views. Some leading thinkers on the Nationalist side consider the idea of a federation &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am trying to answer the various interjections. I just want to say that the notion of federation has been accepted by leading thinkers on the other side as not involving integration. I refer to no less a person that Mr. Willie van Heerden. He wrote in the December 1960 issue of &#x201C;Optima&#x201D; under the heading &#x201C;The Road to Separate Racial Development in South Africa,&#x201D; and I should like to quote:</p>

<block name="quote">Cognizance must be taken of two very definite views that exist about this among the supporters of separate development. The one is represented by the standpoint advanced by Dr. Verwoerd which, at present, enjoys official preference, namely that the Bantu homelands must be able to develop to complete independence. Contrasted with this there is the other view, enjoying a fairly wide measure of support, which holds that the ultimate objective to be aimed at and sought should not be a series of states and little states, but some kind of federation of black and white states. This is a goal which will produce all kinds of problems and which will demand vision, adaptability and statesmanship from White as well as non-White if they are to be solved. But, undoubtedly, it also has great attractions compared with any other plan that has been put forward so far. The crux &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you twice found it necessary to instruct the hon. member who has just sat down, to return to the Bill. Consequently I do not want to follow him outside the ring. What the hon. member said here at times this afternoon and what all the other hon. members said, clearly spelt out one great truth to us. The hon. member for Mooi River gave us a sermon about doubting. What has happened in this debate is that there is no longer any doubt about the hollow story that we have taken over the policy of that side. There is no longer any doubt in anybody&#x2019;s mind about this matter. This debate has shown us the difference very clearly. Those stories of theirs that we have taken over their policy have now been proved groundless. The test in this Bill, which clearly states the cardinal principle of the policy of the National Party, has proved this.</p>

<p>In 1965 Dr. Verwoerd said very succinctly in this House that our policy is separation and that the core of the policy of separation is political separation. Our present Prime Minister has again told us that we have irrevocably taken the course of separation. This policy of separateness and of separate development is not a barren, mechanistic policy. It is not separation purely for the sake of separation, but separation with a positive content. The positive content is to give people development and rights which you grant them in terms of the moral basis of this policy. The principle of self-determination is inherently contained in this policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands told us that they would still take differences into consideration, but that they were so scared that we would allow these people, with the status they are now acquiring, to develop into a danger. They wanted to keep them together, which would supposedly ensure our safety. I want to quote from page 3 of <i>New Nation</i> of February, 1970. This magazine gives a summary of the policy in respect of these peoples as set out by the hon. member for Hillbrow. He speaks of the &#x201C;basic realism of the United Party&#x201D;. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It recognizes diversity, but it seeks to create from this amalgam of diversity a totality that is greater and stronger than the sum of its parts, as this will secure the best long-term security for all.</block>

<p>He speaks of an &#x201C;amalgam&#x201D; here, in other words, an amalgamated mixture of dissimilar elements. This is the definition of &#x201C;amalgam&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In the course of the debate hon. members have referred to dual citizenship and its dangers. We heard about dual citizenship which would be in conflict with the tradition of the Afrikaner in this country. There is a great difference. In the past dual citizenship meant the following for the South African, and for the Afrikaner in particular. It was an obstacle on the road to his freedom. Here is the difference. This status which is being given to these peoples is not an obstacle, but the starting point, the point of departure towards becoming free. This is the difference between the two.</p>

<p>We have two basic questions before us. The one is: Is the principle of this Bill properly founded in law? In the course of the debate this afternoon there have been references, innuendoes and questions such as &#x201C;How do you obtain a status through domicile?&#x201D; It has been asked where on earth this was found. The second question is: Is the legislation politically sound and constructive? These two principles form the basis. We would have liked replies and constructive contributions to these questions, but the main speaker on that side of this House astonished us here last night. I must honestly say that, from a political point of view, the hon. member&#x2019;s performance amounted to a sledge-hammer peroration with many war-cries, much noise and many blows in the air. From the legal point of view his speech was a vacuum performing an egg-dance.</p>

<p>This concept of a local citizenship is not a new-fangled innovation. It is not something which South Africa has thought up and which is found nowhere else in the world. It is not even alien to constitutional law in general to differentiate between the citizens of a state. Sir, I have here a book by a world authority, Dr. Hansj&#x00F6;rg Jellinek. The book has a very long title: &#x201C;The Automatic Acquisition and Loss of Citizenship in Terms of Rulings in International Law and Simultaneously a Contribution to the Doctrine of State Succession.&#x201D; I quote what Dr. Jellinek says on page 40 of his book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This survey of the internal citizenship regulation of the main countries shows that every state reserves the possibility of differentiating in regard to the rights of its subjects and can make provision for all racial and cultural differences.</block>

<p>This is a world authority, Sir; he has nothing to do with apartheid, and he is stating the general rules in this connection.</p>

<p>But, Sir, we must draw a distinction&#x2014;and hon. members on the opposite side have not done this&#x2014;between nationality or national citizenship which has significance externally, in international law, i.e. in the sense of the law of nations, and, on the other hand, local citizenship, which does not enjoy recognition in international law, but which nevertheless has a proper basis in constitutional law. This is one basic concept which hon. members on that side apparently refuse to understand. If hon. members ask me what I base this on, my reply is that I find numerous examples in the Western world. Sir, I mention to you the case of Malaya. The Union of Malaya consisted of several principalities. Each principality had its own local citizenship over and above its British citizenship. Until 1957, before the Federation of Malaya became independent, they had a local citizenship, and here I refer to an authority, Clive Parry&#x2019;s <i>Nationality and Citizenship Laws</i>, the second volume, page 1151&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before the Federation of Malaya achieved independence, citizenship thereof was, from the international point of view, a sub-category of the nationality of the State known as the United Kingdom, or the United Kingdom and Colonics. And from an internal point of view it was a local status attaching to persons connected with Malaya who were, quite independently of their enjoyment of that status, already either citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or, <i>qua</i> subjects of the ruler, one or other of the Malay States &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, just like these people, in spite of the retention of nationality for the purposes of international law, they will enjoy a status, the status of local citizenship, which will afford them certain rights, but which will in no way detract from their nationality. In other words, this is not an unknown principle.</p>

<p>Sir, we also find variations on this theme. It has been said here that this breaks up people. I mention to you the Swiss variation on this theme, and they are surely a highly civilized nation. I refer you to an authority, &#x201C;The Federal Constitution of Switzerland&#x201D; by Hughes. Sir, I want to draw your attention to the fact that there is a difference in the Christian names; this makes a very big difference to the authority. I am referring to Christopher Hughes. This author draws a distinction among three types of citizenship in Switzerland. He states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Swiss citizenship denotes the status of the Swiss subject which secures him the protection of his diplomatic representatives abroad, and of his constitutional rights at home.</block>

<p>This refers to citizenship in international law. But along with this we find &#x201C;cantonal citizenship&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Cantonal citizenship&#x201D; is a purely internal matter. For the Swiss citizen who does not live in his home canton it represents an inherited sentimental link with a name, an area to which he may some day be confined, but out of which he can never be driven. This hereditary cantonal citizenship is of undeniable spiritual and emotional value.</block>

<p>This is what we find in Switzerland. But there is a third form, namely &#x201C;communal citizenship&#x201D;, and this has nothing to do with municipal electoral laws&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Communal citizenship&#x201D; is a most important and original institution, and one that has profoundly affected the Swiss national character. For the foreigner seeking Swiss nationality it means that he must first &#x201C;buy himself in&#x201D; to a commune, and membership of that commune will thereafter be a hereditary and nearly indelible status for him and his descendants. For the citizen who lives outside his home commune, communal citizenship designates an area that will be the ultimate refuge of his family in poverty, disgrace or difficulty and constitutes a strong sentimental link.</block>

<p>And then, strikingly enough&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And in all cases it will mean a police control, through the &#x201C;Heimatschein&#x201D; or document of origin &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_1927-1928" refersTo="page_0978"/>the homeland document&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which serves as a sort of internal passport for settlement outside his home commune.</block>

<p>Here we have a variation, in the case of one of the most advanced nations of Western Europe, of the concept of a local citizenship with strong sentimental links to which the people are attached, links which bind them outside their canton or &#x201C;commune&#x201D;, and which contain for them the promise that, although they do not live there, they may go there one day, that it is their home.</p>

<p>Sir, my time is limited; I should very much have liked to exchange a few words with that hon. member, but I think that when we are discussing this type of subject, he should rather keep his lid on.</p>

<p>Sir, people will perhaps say to me: Very well, you have now been overseas, but what about South Africa? I now come to the authority, Prof. Heine, who was quoted by the hon. the Minister last night from the <i>Journal of Contemporary Roman-Dutch Law</i>. This is very interesting. He wrote this critical analysis with reference to the Transkei Act and he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under the laws of most States citizenship connotes full membership, including the possession of political rights. Some states distinguish between different classes of citizens.</block>

<p>Here we again find the statement that was made by Dr. Jellinek. And then he states this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question now is: Why was it deemed necessary to incorporate into the new constitution the elaborate provisions of section 7, creating a rather local citizenship?</block>

<p>He is referring to the Transkeian Constitution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The obvious reason for creating the new citizenship lies in the intention to denote a new and stronger tie of allegiance to the Bantu homeland and in the practical functions of the term &#x201C;citizen&#x201D; in later provisions of the Constitution.</block>

<p>He then continues, and bear in mind that this Bill is based on the Transkei Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">International law recognizes the concept of internal as opposed to external nationality; that is to say, a state may regard certain persons in the field of international intercourse as its nationals, at the same time withholding from them certain inner-state rights. In English law protected persons are treated <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> foreign States as British nationals and are by convention protected like them abroad, but in the municipal sphere they are distinguished from aliens as well as from citizens.</block>

<p>And then, with reference to all these dangers that have been seen, we have this significant quotation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Historically seen, the intentions of the Republican Government and those of the Transkeian people are identical insofar as they both acknowledge the lessons learned from the constitutional struggles of other nations: nationhood is to be achieved before Statehood.</block>

<p>Sir, we also heard here this afternoon that this legislation does not comply with the basic requirements for the acquisition of citizenship, and the question of domicile was then mentioned. This learned author analyses the Transkei Act and then states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In preparation of the Hague Convention of 1930 the Harvard draft had restated the principle known to international law all along, viz. that the <i>jus soli</i>, the <i>jus sanguinis</i> and the <i>jus originis</i> may be used by municipal law either alternatively or cumulatively.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Section 7 (2) applies all three systems alternatively and so complies in every respect with conventional international law.</block>

<p>Sir, we have been asked to mention an example of any country in the world where one can obtain citizenship through domicile. That hon. member is forgetting his own country. I refer here to Verloren van Themaat&#x2019;s <i>Staatsreg</i>, page 373 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A British subject or citizen of a &#x201C;commonwealth country&#x201D; who, before 2nd September, 1949, automatically became a Union national through two years&#x2019; domicile in the Union, is now regarded as a South African citizen by registration.</block>

<p>Sir, as far as South African authorities are concerned, I want to point out to you that these learned experts too find no fault with the concepts in the Transkei Act. and they go further than that. They mention the example of Canada, in British constitutional law, which had its own citizenship in 1910, but which did not receive international recognition for it and whose citizens were not recognized in England as British subjects. We have all these variations of this concept. In law, therefore, we can find no fault with this. The dual citizenship bogey has no foundation.</p>

<p>Sir, with reference to the view taken by that side of the House, I now want to ask this question: Have they acted constructively? They have shown that they have no arguments against the legal principle of this Bill; their opposition is to our policy of apartheid. What they are <span class="col_1929-1930" refersTo="page_0979"/>in fact saying is this: The U.P. do not grant the Bantu peoples in the Republic the perpetuation and the development of their own language and cultural community. They do not believe that the Bantu have a national pride and a national sentiment of their own. The U.P. do not believe that the Bantu people can undergo a separate political development; they do not support the establishment of territorial authorities; they refuse to grant the Bantu recognition of their own identity along the road of their own citizenship with its emotional value and sentiment, because all these factors are in conflict with the U.P.&#x2019;s dangerous race federation plan. In the few minutes I have left. I want to ask them this question, with reference to their statement that the non-white peoples of this country are not in favour of this plan: When did they consult the leaders of the Bantu peoples about their federation plan? Sir, I shall present to them the evidence of a Bantu leader, as recently published in Mr. Stanley Uys&#x2019;s column in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 1st February, in which he quotes a speech which a Transkeian Minister made at the University of the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>I would need another half-hour for that. [Interjections.] No, I am not running away from it. He delivered a speech which, seen from his point of view, was a very good one, and although I cannot fully agree with what he said, he gave a definite reply to the U.P. on their plan. This is the one aspect to which he gave a decisive reply, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have no ambition to go to Cape Town any more and, if we ever did, it would have to be under somewhat different circumstances along the road that goes via Umtata &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is how the Bantu feel about the policy of the U.P., and therefore we must follow the policy of this side in order to give them citizenship, a future, a homeland of their own in which to realize themselves politically.</p>

<p>He goes on to say this, and in so doing gives us an insight into the soul of the Bantu&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The bright lights and imposing buildings of the white cities we have helped to build have less appeal for us than the barren land that gives us a sense of belonging.</block>

<p>This is what the Bantu look forward to&#x2014; &#x201C;a sense of belonging&#x201D;. But what do we get from that side of the House? Only two carrots, in fact. They tell the Bantu that there will be one large common fatherland, the &#x201C;amalgam&#x201D;, common citizenship and a common central government with eight representatives for them. But how will these eight representatives be divided in practice? After all, we have the urban Bantu, who will perhaps have more than one council, and we have the differences, the &#x201C;diversities&#x201D;, which the U.P. want to recognize. Will all these peoples such as the Zulus and the Xhosas have the same number of representatives? Who will have representatives and who will not? This is the one carrot which they hold out. Then they have another carrot for the Whites. They say that they will maintain this position for ever, but it has already been admitted on that side that &#x201C;it will be inevitable&#x201D; that changes will have to be made. In 1965 the hon. member for Yeoville said he believed that the representation would not always remain White. But what we have never had a reply to is this: In 1965 Dr. Verwoerd repeatedly asked the Leader of the Opposition across the floor of this House whether they would be prepared to maintain that sovereignty over the whole of South Africa by force. They only use the word &#x201C;maintain&#x201D;. When the Leader of the Opposition replied, at the time he said, &#x201C;with all the means at my disposal&#x201D;. Dr. Verwoerd asked whether this included force, but to this day they still owe South Africa a reply to that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I have had the opportunity of listening to quite a few speeches from hon. members opposite on this subject and I have come to the conclusion without a doubt that if this is the best hon. members opposite can put up to further their cause within the next few months, then I have no doubt whatsoever about the outcome. I want to put a few questions to the hon. the Minister before I go further into this Bill. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister who first thought of this Bantu Homelands Citizenship Bill? Who asked for it? I am asking hon. members. Where did it originate? Did the Bantu ask for it? Did any Bantu ask for it? Did the white people ask for it? No, now there is no answer. Apparently no one asked for this Bill. Did the late Dr. Verwoerd ever suggest a measure of this nature? Did he in his vision of independent states for the Bantu people suggest that eventually a Bill of this nature would be brought before this Parliament to give every Bantu living in the so-called white areas citizenship? No, it did not come from Dr. Verwoerd. Did Dr. Tomlinson in his report suggest that a measure of this sort be introduced? I am putting these questions to the hon. the Minister and I would like a reply, whether Professor Tomlinson suggested in his report that there should be a Bill of this nature. And why was this Bill brought before Parliament on the eve of a general election? It is quite obvious that it <span class="col_1931-1932" refersTo="page_0980"/>was brought to Parliament and is being rushed through on the eve of a general election, not in the interests of the Bantu or in the interests of the white people outside, but only in the interests of the Nationalist Party sitting here. If that is not so, why can they not answer my questions? Yet now, on the eve of the election, we have another Bill dealing with Bantu, more and more laws forced on to the South African Parliament dealing with Bantu, and the more apartheid laws there are, the more economic integration takes place. I often wonder, if we had a yardstick and we could measure by some means or other the time spent in this Parliament discussing the Bantu, as against the time spent discussing, and working out problems in the interest of the white man, what we would find? I think most people in South Africa would be alarmed because there are already many who wonder how much time is spent on the Bantu and how little time in the interest of the Whites. So much of it is unnecessary legislation. It is not all that important. This legislation is not in the interest of the Bantu. It is only in the interest of the party opposite.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with clause 2 (b) in the White Paper. It says that as in the case of the Transkei, a positive value is placed on citizenship, namely the exercise of franchise rights in the territory concerned, apart from other benefits, duties, rights and responsibilities which may follow on such citizenship. It refers to these rights and duties which may follow on such citizenship. I can say right here and now that these sweet words will not bluff the Bantu people. In the first instance, when they were asked to apply for the franchise in the Transkei under the new Territorial Authority, their Parliament, they were very sceptical at that time, and to this day I know of many Bantu who are still not registered as voters in the Transkei, Bantu living on the borders of the Transkei. They have refused to register as voters because they were and still are afraid that if they registered, they would be sent back immediately to where they are supposed to belong, and they were afraid to do that. Now a measure is being introduced to give them a certificate of citizenship. Apparently it is not all that important because they will not have to carry these certificates at all times, such as is the case of having to carry their identity books. I cannot see why at this late hour of this short session a measure of this nature should be introduced. This Bill is only to smokescreen the failures of the Nationalist Party, because we see now, on the eve of an election, the culmination of years and years of failure on the part of this Government.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned last night only some of the Acts which have been placed on the Statute Book. The hon. member for Carletonville this afternoon mentioned that there were some 20 Bills which have come before Parliament dealing with the Bantu. The hon. the Minister mentioned the 1959 Bill dealing with the promotion of self-government, the 1963 Transkei Constitution Bill and the 1968 Bill dealing with South West Africa. We have had years and years of legislation, and what have they got to show for it to-day? Nothing at all. Many people have been bluffed by all this legislation, and not only that, but a lot of time and of the taxpayers&#x2019; money have been spent here. The hon. the Minister mentioned also last night a certain book which he read and studies, entitled <i>South African Nationality</i>, and he quoted from this book, but that was only one man&#x2019;s opinion, the opinion of the author. I found it very interesting, but here I want to quote from another magazine, a fairly old one printed in 1892, here in Long Street, Cape Town. Dealing with this very issue, it mentions what President Reitz had to say about the Native problem. The headlines are, &#x201C;The Native Question&#x201D;, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In his paper on this subject recently contributed to the <i>Cape Illustrated Magazine</i>, President Reitz, although no great alarmist, presents to his readers the importance of mature consideration and subsequent action.</block>

<p>Then he gives six points which I feel are very interesting, and I would like the hon. the Minister to listen to the six points which President Reitz maintained contained the solution to the Native problem some 70 years ago. Hon. members opposite are always very keen to quote from President Reitz and President Steyn and President Kruger, and I believe they should be interested to hear what President Reitz had to say. His first solution was to get rid of the tribal system: secondly, to abolish the chieftainships. We said that if there are no chiefs there can be no responsible leaders and no rebellion can be successfully maintained without a central figure around whom the people may rally. His third point&#x2014;I am only giving the headings of these six points&#x2014;is that &#x201C;by the sweat of thy brow thou shalt earn thy bread&#x201D;, and with a view to this end. to break up all locations, great and small. The fourth one is to suppress by law all heathen rites which are undoubtedly and flagrantly immoral and degrading. The fifth was to discourage polygamy, and the selling and buying of women which it involved; and the sixth one I believe is very significant.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is very relevant to this subject. It is to adopt the principle and maintain it steadfastly that there shall be no equality between the aborigines of South Africa and the people of European descent who have made this land their home. He went on to deal with the franchise and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1933-1934" refersTo="page_0981"/>Providing that a restriction be placed on Native representation in order to guard against the European being outvoted, there is no reason why the Natives should not be an extremely useful factor in the administration of this country.</block>

<p>And then he ends up by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The problem for South African statesmen is how to deal with the Natives so as to make them of real benefit to the country in which we all mean to live.</block>

<p>Where do we find ourselves to-day under this Nationalist Party? Granted, for the last 22 years we have been under their rule, but much has happened within the last 70 years since President Reitz had a say in affairs and was ruling, and a lot of changes have taken place in the philosophy of the Afrikaner. This new philosophy has been successful in as far as it has won them votes, but the day has dawned when the people have now woken up to the fact that very little is taking place to further apartheid. The hon. the Minister mentioned last night in his second-reading speech, and this I found interesting, that &#x201C;die Bantoe sal nie vreemdelinge wees in die blanke gebied nie&#x201D;. Those were his words. They will no longer be strangers in the so-called white area. Sir, I am left guessing as to who the Nationalist Party in fact regard as strangers. I am pleased that the hon. member for Carletonville is in his seat, because not so long ago I asked him a question at a public meeting in Queenstown. We were dealing with this very issue. I asked him how the franchise would work in regard to Bantu living in the so-called white areas. I asked him whether this would involve postal votes. I think the hon. member will remember. He was on the platform and I was asking him questions. That night he stated categorically that we must regard every Bantu in the so-called white area as &#x201C;uitlanders, vreemdelinge of besoekers&#x201D;. Those were his words.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I recall the time when there were vans being driven all over the country taking photographs of the Bantu for their identity books. Now the Minister has not explained to us what procedure would be followed once this Bill is placed on the Statute Book. We should like to know who all these photographers are going to be, and who is going to appoint them. We should like to know what this is all going to involve and what it is all going to cost the white taxpayer. If it is not going to cost the white taxpayer any money, who is going to pay for it? this is what we want to know. I do not want to repeat what has already been said. I will bring up some new points; and here is another issue which has not yet been mentioned. All the Bantu living in the so-called white areas are going to be given citizenship in their so-called homelands. The Xhosas are going to be given citizenship of the Transkei, the Zulus will have citizenship of Zululand, and so on. Meanwhile these people have all been born and bred in the so-called white areas. They know no other place, and many know nothing about a homeland. How does the Minister justify his philosophy in this regard, when one bears in mind all the white people living in the Transkei, Zululand, Lesotho, Swaziland or anywhere else? Those people living there can be and many are South African citizens, regardless of their language or ancestry. Now we come to the interesting point. I want to ask the hon. the Minister: When this Bill becomes law and every Bantu becomes a citizen of a foreign state, who is going to undertake the issuing of passports should any of those Bantu want to go overseas?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I have read the Bill. [Interjections.] Sir, here is another point which has been mentioned here, and outside this House before, but I should like to mention it again now. When people become South African citizens, some members, particularly on that side of the House, object to them speaking about the land of their ancestors as &#x201C;home&#x201D;, whether it be France, Germany or Britain. I include myself amongst those who object to this practice. What is to happen to the Bantu when he gets his citizenship? What are hon. members opposite then going to think and say? Will he be entitled to speak about a land or state which he has never seen or heard of as &#x201C;home&#x201D; when he lives here in another state? What are hon. members going to say then? They must give us these answers because we want to know the answers for the election pending. After all the years of warning <span class="col_1935-1936" refersTo="page_0982"/>from this side of the House, warnings of the dangers involved in all these laws that have been passed, only the other day the hon. the Minister of Labour, when discussing the problem in Lesotho, said that the trouble there was Communism. Communists are the instigators of all the trouble in Lesotho, he said. If it is so easy for communists to reach a country like Lesotho which does not have a coast-line at all, how is this Government going to protect our shores from communists, when a large section of our eastern seaboard and comprise an Independent State? I ask these questions and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will reply to them, sooner or later we must have the answers, and members supporting this Government will have to give them. Mr. Speaker, I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment moved by the hon. member for Transkei.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we listened to the debate and after some discussion amongst ourselves, we came to the conclusion that one hon. member, who represents a constituency in East London, will not be returning to this House. Now that this hon. member has spoken, we are sure that two hon. members from East London will not be returning. The hon. member for East London (North) continued in the ineffectual attitude which the United Party has displayed in respect of this legislation. He too simply proceeded to make a Committee-Stage speech. From the main speaker down, their speeches have dealt with clause upon clause. He in turn expressed concern about the legal validity of this citizenship. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus made an excellent speech here. He proved that this citizenship has a perfectly sound legal basis. But what has the theme of the United Party been throughout this debate? Their theme has been that this legislation is unrealistic. It is not practical. They said that it was unnecessary and asked why we had to have it. This is precisely the attitude adopted by the United Party. We are three and a half million Whites on the southern tip of Africa, while there are approximately 220 million non-Whites in Africa as a whole. Africa consists of about 48 states, many of which were established in the past decade. The Whites of Europe fled, because they had to give way to the rising nationalism of the black states of Africa. That is what they had to do. Here we are taking into account the nationalism of our own non-Whites in South Africa. Those hon. members say it is not practical politics. I want to say that this legislation is excellent and really practical politics, because we as Whites must devise ways of existing here and of coexisting with the non-Whites in this country. The only way in which we can coexist with them is by recognizing the nationalism in the non-Whites, because we ourselves know what nationalism is. We know what the urge for self-fulfilment means. That is why we take this into account. We acknowledge it.</p>

<p>I want to say that, apart from the hon. member for Albany, the hon. members on that side did not raise any matters of principle. He was the only man who produced the old story about the danger which independent homelands present to the Whites. At least he is thinking about the Whites and their future. I believe he is sincere in that. But the hon. member for Green Point&#x2014;unfortunately he is not here&#x2014;surprised us terribly. He had apparently visited Vendaland for the first time and was surprised to find a modern university at Turfloop. He said: &#x201C;It is not a tribal university&#x201D;. What he actually meant by a &#x201C;tribal university&#x201D;, I do not know. The hon. member is really a stranger in Jerusalem. Does he not realize that there are more than 35 universities in Africa, excluding the Arabian countries? There are 42,000 non-white students in Africa. Are those all &#x201C;tribal&#x201D; universities? What did he expect to see at Turfloop? He reminds me of the American visitor who arrived at Turfloop, looked at the little hill behind the university and said: &#x201C;This here is a wonderful rockery. It sure must have cost a lot of money to erect it&#x201D;. This is what he thought when he saw that rocky little hill. It is this sort of observation which the hon. member for Green Point reminds me of.</p>

<p>The hon. member must keep quiet; he knows even less about it.

Has he ever had discussions with the leaders of these peoples? Does he realize what they are thinking and what they are talking about? No, Sir, I want to tell you that this hon. member is a danger to the white man in South Africa. If we have to leave our future in such hands, it would mean the downfall of the white man.</p>

<p>But now the hon. member for Albany comes forward with the old story about the terrible danger which our homelands policy and this legislation along the road of political development will present to the future of the Whites. After all, the hon. member for Odendaalsrus explained very clearly what the consequences of the United Party&#x2019;s policy would be. Eventually the United Party would have to yield. They admitted that there would be non-white representation in this House. The result of this would be that the Whites would be placed in a powerless and indefensible position in an anaemic way, and would have to hand over the country as a whole. Eventually it would be under non-white control, because of their superior numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was busy proving that the National Party&#x2019;s policy of political development for the Bantu presented no greater danger to this country than the normal dangers which any sovereign, independent state has to face every day. It carries the normal risks which any state must run every day. The United Party&#x2019;s policy means and implies the end of white civilization in South Africa. Our policy offers a safe way to the future. The United Party has once again proved that it stands naked before the people in its complete inability to penetrate to the core of this country&#x2019;s multi-national problems. The shallowness and the ineptitude of its policy are being exposed here. It can only act negatively. It is once again revealing the fact that it really has no long-term policy. It is also revealing the fact that it is totally ignorant of the feelings and aspirations of the various Bantu peoples in this country. In its dogged opposition to this legislation it is also denying every Bantu people in this multinational country of ours the fundamental right to national pride and self-respect. The United Party denies the real physical facts which have been left to us by history. History has left us a certain legacy. What is that legacy? That legacy is that within the Republic of South Africa and within the borders of South West Africa we have 15 different Bantu peoples, each with its own language, its own culture and, what is very important, its own territory which it actually occupies. This situation we inherited through history from the hand of the Almighty. It is also a fact that the position of power was left in the hands of the Whites. We, the Whites, could therefore choose in which direction we wanted to use that position of power. We could have used it in the direction of suppression and exploitation. We could have used it in the direction of the well-meaning guardian and according to the principles of a Christian moral basis. We have chosen the direction of separation and not that of integration and assimilation. The Whites made that choice, and it is a very clear choice. The people who made this choice were the supporters of the National Party. The National Party has a particular point of view which is basically the political point of view of the Afrikaner. The Afrikaner is, after all, through and through a product of Africa and Africa alone. The choice was made and in 1948 a mandate was given by the people of South Africa. I do not intend to read the mandate again. It was read out this afternoon by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad. I do, however, want to refer to a few sections of that mandate. That mandate provided that the Whites would look after the non-Whites, and that it would be done on the basis of the Christian principles of justice and fairness.</p>

<p>But that is precisely what I am reading now. I would really be glad if that hon. member would not display his ignorance in this way. I even feel sorry for the hon. member. I feel embarrassed on his behalf. As I said, that is the mandate we were given. The people had to decide and we had to continue from there. That mandate indicated the direction, the road which we were to follow. That road still had to be prepared and opened up through the forest of multinationalism and multi-racialism in this country. That road had to be opened up without disrupting our economy and without disturbing racial harmony. We could not seek advice from any place in the world. There was no blueprint. There was no other country which could show us what to do. We had to do it ourselves. In order to do it, we had a few resources at our disposal. The first of these <span class="col_1939-1940" refersTo="page_0984"/>was our faith and the confidence that we would be able to complete this task. The second was the strong, rising national desire we had for retaining our identity. The third was our maintenance and our knowledge of the code of Christian justice and fairness. In the fourth instance we adopted the standpoint that in everything we did, we granted anyone else that which we claimed for ourselves.</p>

<p>This National Party therefore grants any people which has the capacity and the will, the opportunity of complete self-realization. It grants any people the opportunity of achieving file highest degree of national pride. It also grants any people the opportunity to achieve the highest degree of political development. It is very clear that the United Party, in opposing this legislation, will grant no people which might ever be placed in its power, these fundamental rights. It thinks only of the economic aspect and how things fit into the economic cycle. This so-called measure of self-government and white leadership which that party is hawking with, are to my mind nothing but political opportunism. It is a form of overlordship which will lead to the eventual downfall of the white man in South Africa.</p>

<p>Since 1948 the National Party has made brilliant progress along this unknown road. Slowly but surely the Bantu have become aware of this new message. It brought them the hope of retaining their own identity. To the tradition-bound and nationally conservative Bantu this message of the National Party was one of joy. The Bantu have rediscovered themselves under the policy of the National Party. All the tempting words uttered by the liberalists about mixed statehood together with the white man the Bantu allowed to pass them by. They did not believe in that. A new attitude has developed among the Bantu. This course of self-realization in the political sphere is fundamental and basic to our policy.</p>

He spoke about support for this measure from the Bantu throughout South Africa. I just want to quote an editorial from the <i>Week-end World</i> of Sunday, 6th April, 1969, written by a Bantu for the Bantu. He was writing about the Citizenship Bill and said this&#x2014;</p>

<p>There were other aspects raised by this hon. member and other hon. members during the course of this debate. I will reply to those points during the course of my speech. Unfortunately my time is limited. I must get on with what I want to say.</p>

<p>Dealing with this question of apartheid the members of the Nationalist Government and the hon. the Minister have repeatedly stressed that the Bantu are only in the so-called white areas for their labour and for the service that they can provide for the white man. They have stressed repeatedly that they can have no rights in the so-called white-owned land, whether political or economical. That is the whole basis of this Bill, namely to try to establish for the Bantu rights in the so-called homelands, before this Government comes to remove the last remaining rights the Bantu do have in what this Government likes to call white South Africa.</p>

Here we have this Government coming with this half-baked measure which really confers nothing whatsoever on the Bantu, primarily so that they can turn to their own supporters and their critics, whether in this country or outside this country, and say that they have given them this right and as a <i>quid pro quo</i> are removing their rights in the white areas.

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw, Sir. As I have said, the attitude of this Government is that the Bantu are in the so-called white areas on sufferance only. When they cease to be useful to the Whites they must be sent back to the so-called homelands whether or not there is provision for them to eke out a living there. They have also said that the white man is under no obligation to develop the Bantu areas for the Bantu and that the Bantu must to this for themselves. They say that the white Government will, however, assist them where they can, from a sense of charity, and, of course, as their &#x201C;kindly guardians&#x201D;, as this hon. Minister continues to tell us. This Bill is a further manifestation of this attitude, namely that the Bantu do not belong in the so-called white South Africa and that they must be forced to their own areas and be allowed to develop themselves. They must be &#x201C;tied&#x201D;, and these are the words used by the hon. the Minister himself, &#x201C;to the homelands politically&#x201D;. They will then no longer be our problem. What this Nationalist Government must realize is that the Bantu want nothing from the white man himself in South Africa. All that they expect is that this Government that rules them must do its duty by them. This Government cannot rule the Bantu, cannot tax them, cannot legislate for them and at the same time repudiate its obligations to the Bantu people and with it the duty to be responsible for the welfare of the Bantu people. This Minister and others have claimed that this Bill will destroy the myth (I think this is the way the ex-Deputy Minister of Planning put it), that Whites and Bantu are citizens of one multiracial state. Only to-day the hon. member for Mooi River handled this matter very well. He burst the unrealistic and illogical bubble of the thinking of the Nationalist Party. It is all very well passing a Bill denying the Bantu their South African citizenship, but where is the land of which they are to be citizens? Does such a land exist? Let me say that when this Bill is passed it will only be a land which exists in some ethereal dream in the mind of that hon. Minister. No such land exists in reality and I believe that the Bantu do not really want such a land. I believe also that when the Bantu consider the mass of illogical legislation which is being passed by this Government, this illogical legislation which governs them and their relations with the so-called white South Africa and, above all, this illogical Bill which is at present before this House which will deny them their South African citizenship, the Bantu would prefer to take the land that is given them as their homeland. The Bantu will accept this under protest because they do not desire it. All the Bantu desire are to be treated as persons and citizens of South Africa, to which country they have at all times been loyal.</p>

<p>The tragedy of what this Government is now doing to the people is compounded by the fact that even before this Bill was introduced, this Government was actively fostering and encouraging nationalism amongst the various Bantu people. We had the speech of the hon. member for Germiston. We have also had the speech of the hon. member for Pietersburg now. We have also had statements by the hon. the Minister. I do not believe that anybody on that side of the House will deny that this Government is actively fostering, and I do not intend any pun in that word, and encouraging the development of nationalism amongst the Bantu people in this country. Does anybody on that side of the House deny this point?</p>

They took those powers to stamp out this very threat of black nationalism, the black nationalism which they claimed was being sponsored by Communism. To-day we have the position that black nationalism is not sponsored by Communism, but that black nationalism is sponsored by this Government. Where does the threat to South Arica lie to-day? If there was a threat in the black nationalism a few years ago, surely it exists to-day. Before I have finished my speech, I want to make the point that that black nationalism is becoming more militant. It is being actively sponsored by this Government.

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is for each of the ethnic groups recognized by this Government and particularly recognized by the Bill which is before the House to-day, with the exception of the North Sotho or the Pedi people, a National Party which has developed in this country. These National Parties have binded themselves together into an organization known as the official African Political Parties of South Africa. They issue a publication which is registered at the General Post Office, called <i>Africa South</i>. It is registered as a newspaper. This particular magazine has been brought to the attention of the hon. the Minister before. At that stage he denied all knowledge of it, and I accept that denial. However, I am sure that he is aware of the existence of this newspaper now. I have here an edition of this newspaper dated October, 1969. On the front page at the bottom is written &#x201C;Africa South is the official organ of the official African Political Parties of South Africa&#x201D;. On page three we find the following statement with regard to the function of this particular periodical:</p>

<block name="quote">The &#x201C;Africa South&#x201D; monthly magazine is an independent monthly magazine which aims at propagating ideas on multi-national development &#x2026;</block>

<p>Quite in line with Government thinking&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which must lead to ethnic autonomous republics of Southern Africa. These different racial republics will unite to form the Confederation and Common Market for Southern Africa.</block>

<p>Then it places the following advert:</p>

<block name="quote">Join and become a member of one of the following National Parties: Zulu, Tswana, Venda, Ndebele, Swazi, Sotho, Lebowa, Tsonga and Xhosa which are determined and dedicated to establish the Confederation and Common Market for Southern Africa which will be the United States of Southern Africa (U.S.S.A.).</block>

<p>What is this United States of Southern Africa? We find in this particular edition an article written by the managing editor who, incidentally, is also the national chairman of the Zulu National Party in which he makes the following statement:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; &#x201C;Africa South&#x201D; magazine is pro Government in so far as the Government of South Africa accepts the political philosophy of separate freedoms, that must lead to the political independence of all the different national groups and once these groups have attained freedom, they should form a customs union, a common market and eventually a confederation of the United States of Southern Africa, which should include all countries in Africa, south of the Sahara.</block>

<p>This is the nationalism which is being sponsored by this Government and which this Bill actively propagates. This Bill actively makes it easier for all these particular national parties to go ahead. They propagate that they will form a United States of Southern Africa which should include all the countries in southern Africa south of the Sahara. Is this really what this Government is propagating and supporting? Do they want a black nationalist movement of this nature?</p>

<p>This nationalist movement amongst the Bantu people is becoming more militant towards their own people who will not join this movement. I want to take it further. If any further evidence of the involvement of the Government in this movement is required, I want to quote the following case. An influential Bantu was visited by the Managing Editor of this magazine who is also the National President of the Zulu National Party. He was asked to write for this magazine. He described the visit in the following terms:</p>

<block name="quote">He (that is Mr. Ndaba, who is the Managing Editor) said that he was paying me a social call and spoke about independence to me, asking me to write for Africa South. I said that I was scared of the Security Branch. Mr. Ndaba said he would deal with them.</block>

<p>It looks as if this movement is really fostered by this Government. If this editor can say this to an influential Bantu, who declines to support him in his views because he was afraid <span class="col_1945-1946" refersTo="page_0987"/>of the activities of the Security Branch, it is further proof that this movement is actually fostered by this Government. This editor claimed that he could deal with the Security Branch.</p>

<p>Now it is becoming even more militant, particularly towards its own people as I have said earlier. I want to quote from a letter which was written by this Mr. Ndaba to another influential Bantu. This letter was in connection with the development of this particular political party. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">The National Party will contest all the constituencies with an aim in view of forming the Government. Should you &#x2026;</block>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister realizes this is a serious matter. I see that he thinks it is a joke. It is no joke as far as I am concerned. I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">Should you, with your political advisers, find our National Party unacceptable you will be at liberty to found your own political party to oppose our dynamic party. Then you can expect a ferocious fratricidal feud with all the modern gimmicks, tricks and devastating polemics to light you. In order to avoid that ugly confrontation and a purposeless political war with its unpredictable repercussions, I extend to you the hand of political friendship and offer you a place in the sun where you can still arise and shine.</block>

This is not my thought; it is a thought that I garnered from a very much wiser man than I am; ultimately there will be a confrontation in South Africa between Black and White. As sure as the sun rises after the night there will be a confrontation here between Black and White, and unless the white people in South Africa to-day work towards getting the black people on their side that confrontation is going to be violent; it is not going to be a discussion around a table. The black people will certainly not be on the side of that Government, who think that by this measure they can push them aside, that they can abrogate their responsibilities towards these people and say: &#x201C;But why must we worry about them; they are citizens of a foreign state; they do not belong to us in South Africa; they are here to sell their labour only. We owe them nothing.&#x201D; Sir, that is what this Government is saying with this measure which is now before the House. The hon. member for Germiston made a peculiar statement here.

<p>The hon. member says that it is not impossible that that can happen. Of course, it is not impossible that that can happen, and it will happen particularly when this black nationalism takes over unless that Government is thrown out on the 22nd April and replaced with a sensible government which will come with a practical solution to to-day&#x2019;s problems in South Africa. Sir, is this what this Government intends with this legislation; is this a further step towards the independence of the Bantu areas? Is it the intention of the hon. the Minister to stick to what he said last year, towards the end of the session, in this House when he said that he wanted to give them independence within his time, or does he stick to what he said in 1968 when Mr. Canca in the Transkei Legislative Council introduced a motion asking for independence for the Transkei soon and when he said that there were 11 reasons why they should not have it now? To which statement is he going to adhere? Or was the hon. member for Transkei right when he said that this Bill was the final admission by the hon. the Minister of the failure to implement his policy? Which is the right interpretation? The hon. the Minister does not want to answer, Sir. Perhaps we will hear from him in his reply to this debate. Which is it; is it his intention to give them independence now notwithstanding the development of this black nationalism, or is it his intention not to give them independence as he said in 1968?</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members on the other side and the Minister have spoken a lot about &#x201C;nasiewording&#x201D;. In fact, one hon. member made the point that although this Bill deals with citizenship the hon. the Minister never mentioned citizenship in his second-reading speech; he only spoke about the development of nations. Perhaps hon. members on the other side did not mean &#x201C;nasiewording&#x201D;: they meant &#x201C;nasiebou&#x201D; or perhaps &#x201C;nasieverbastering&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

Of course, the hon. member for Green Point dealt with this very fully but I want to quote briefly from the White Paper dealing with this particular Bill. Clause 3 of this Bill defines Bantu persons who acquire citizenship as those who are born in the area, those domiciled in the area; those Bantu persons speaking the Bantu language used in that area or any associated linguistic group; every other Bantu person related to a member of the Bantu population of that area or who has identified himself with that group or with any part of that group. Sir, I want to come back to this <i>Africa South</i> of October, 1969. Here is an interesting point: A Bantu, writing in a newspaper which is reproduced in this periodical which is subsidized by that Government, says that he wonders where he belongs. He says, &#x201C;I am a Tswana by birth, Ndebele by upbringing, Xhosa by inclination; I speak Zulu better than Xhosa and English better than Tswana&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Just to complicate the matter even further he lives in Soweto. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister where this man belongs. This is why I talked about &#x201C;nasieverbastering&#x201D; because in terms of the provisions of this Bill you are not going to develop a nation of Zulus or a nation of Xhosas or a nation of Tswanas or any other group that you care to mention. What you are going to develop is a group of people who think that they might like to band together. That is what you are going to find. And, Sir, you are going to have the further difficulty that the territorial authority concerned will have the right to oppose the application of one of these people for citizenship. But you will have a Bantu who, in terms of clause 3, will have an association with a particular group and think that he might like to join one of those groups but the territorial authority will be able to oppose it. What is the hon. the Minister going to do with a person like that?</p>

<p>Sir, I think I have shown that it is extremely dangerous at this stage, with the development of a militant black nationalism in this country, to pass a measure such as this. Sir, this is no joke: I mean this in all sincerity. This militancy is developing and their militancy is going to be pointed towards the Whites unless we are extremely careful about it. This Bill goes a step further in advocating and developing and building up this black nationalism, <span class="col_1949-1950" refersTo="page_0989"/>and for that reason I support the amendment of the hon. member for Transkei that this Bill be read this day six months.</p>

If the hon. member does not return after 22nd April, I shall regret it, because then we shall no longer be getting this comic relief from him from time to time. While the hon. member was speaking, someone sent me a note in which he said that if Solomon had known the hon. member, he would probably have expressed himself as follows: &#x201C;He is a finished speaker, finished not in the sense of polish, but finished in the sense that he is at last through his speech.&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I shall come to the hon. member for North Rand later, and then I shall see whether he will still be nodding his head so happily. Over against that we have the policy of the National Party that there are various peoples in South Africa, each with its own language, each with its own culture, each with its own particular background, and that for those reasons we cannot all be one people. I think if one compares the policy of the United Party with that of the National Party, one must have an historical approach in the first place, and one must measure it in terms of the guiding lines and criteria of the requirements of the 20th century in the second place. If one adopts an historical approach and one looks at the dilemma in which we in southern Africa find ourselves to-day and generally at the conditions, the problems, of South Africa, then the problem of South Africa is indeed the problem about which we are legislating this evening, i.e. the fact that South Africa is faced with a problem of Africa to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, centuries ago the colonial powers came to this continent and found peoples here with more than 800 different languages. The hon. the Prime Minister mentioned here the other morning that the New Testament has been translated into 435 African languages alone. There are at least 400 different nations in Africa, and those 400 different nations are grouped together in only 42 independent states. When the colonial powers came here centuries ago and measured out their colonies, they did not do so according to national units. The one did not come and establish a colony for the Xhosa and the other for the Zulu or the Damara. They established them according to natural landmarks which one could see with the naked eye&#x2014;rivers, coast lines, mountain ranges&#x2014;and drew the boundary lines along those landmarks. And what did they do in the process? In many cases they divided a people so that, for example, half of the Okvanyamas are in South West Africa to-day and the other half in Angola. But what happened in most cases, is that from four to ten different peoples were enclosed within the borders of the same colony, with the result they of necessity have to coexist today, so that in South West Africa to-day you have the Bushmen, the Nama, the Herero, the Damara and the Ovambo, and in South Africa the Zulu, the Venda and the Xhosa, and in Nigeria you have the Fulani and the Ibo, and so forth. What is more, these various peoples differ from one another not only in language, but also in background and culture and every other aspect. If we only look at what happened in Nigeria, we see that the Ibos or the Biafrans did not want to identify themselves with the rest of Nigeria, with the result that 200,000 of them died on the battlefield and more than two million of them died of famine, and they only stopped fighting when they were completely vanquished. And what happened in the earlier history of South Africa and South West Africa? There were wars of extermination among these various peoples so that in South West Africa you had no fewer than 56 different wars among them in the 60 years from 1830 to 1890. Now we come to the reality of the situation. In Africa 400 peoples are grouped together in only 42 independent states. [Interjection.] If the hon. member for North Rand would just keep quiet now, he too would learn something. [Interjection.] Now you have the situation that if you apply a modern Western system of democracy in Africa, in any state in which these different peoples are grouped together, you find that the majority <span class="col_1951-1952" refersTo="page_0990"/>constitutes the government and the peoples in the minority are always in the opposition. They can never come into power, not only as a result of their policy, but also as a result of simple little figures and numbers and human nature, because they are in the minority. That is why you have the situation that there have been more than 16 <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tats</i> in African states in the last 20 months. Because that is in fact the only way in which an opposition party can come into power in a multi-national African state. That is why in any African state, including South Africa, one can to-day never think in terms of a democracy as we know it in the politics of the Western world, because it is impossible.</p>

<p>If a system of one man, one vote, the modern Western concept of democracy, were to be introduced in South Africa, you would find that the minority groups such as the Zulu, the Venda, the Tswana and others, including the Whites, would for ever be in the minority and would never be able to come into power unless they applied a <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat</i>. You now have this situation; this is our dilemma. It is true that the present boundary lines were drawn as a result of the actions of our colonial forefathers, but we have to solve this dilemma, and we must solve it not only for to-day or to-morrow; we must solve it for the distant future, for centuries, for posterity.</p>

One solution is that in the direction of which hon. members opposite are moving, and this is simply integration; one allegiance, one citizenship in one South Africa. And the other solution is to grant each people in South Africa its own citizenship, its own territory, its historical land and eventually its sovereignty, because whichever of the two directions you take, you must follow it through in all its consequences.</p>

Only it is not necessary for us to go through that long series of defeats and battles; we are doing it in a peaceful way. That is the only difference. I want to tell you, Sir, that when the United Party chooses the course of integration, as it has now done, then it must also be prepared to accept its full consequences. It must not think that it chooses a course simply to find a nice solution for five or ten years. It must know that the solution which it chooses must be one which will hold good for centuries, and I now ask hon. members of the Opposition whether they are prepared to apply the modern concept of Western democracy on the course which they have chosen. Are they prepared to grant the collective body of South African citizens, irrespective of their colour, the same vote and the same rights in all respects?

[Interjection.] No, the hon. members opposite are choosing a course which leads to death, but when they come to the abyss they will ask where the National Party is and why they followed that course. I can tell you, Sir, that the very same standpoint <span class="col_1953-1954" refersTo="page_0991"/>adopted by hon. members opposite this evening has been adopted in history before; and adopted in precisely the same form by, for example, the imperialists of Britain. To-night we have before us the imperialists of South Africa. They see a great kingdom before them, with a conglomeration of people, with a vast country which they want for themselves, and they want to pocket as much as possible, but they do not see the real consequences of that. When it was debated in the House of Commons from time to time whether Britain should relinquish its colonies, whether it should grant India and Australia and Canada and South Africa their own citizenship, there were also the great imperialists who said: No, we are one British Empire. All must be British citizens. And do you know what saved Britain? Only the fact that its colonies were not situated adjacent to it; otherwise they would have swallowed it up. That saved Britain, but in South Africa it will be a different matter, because these territories are situated within South Africa. I see before me to-day the imperialists of Britain in the flesh. I see Lord Kitchener before me. In the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) I see Rhodes again, because he has the heart of a Rhodes, but not the intellect to go with it. The hon. member for Durban (Point) is a Disraeli; he also thought that he could lay hands on the world. He is too keen; not only does he want for himself that which is his own, but he also wants to lay hands on everything from the Cape to Cairo. He wants a collective citizenship.</p>

<p>I want to make this point and emphasize it. If you, Mr. Speaker, appreciate it, I am still not so sure that hon. members opposite will appreciate it, but I just want to say this, that the same imperialistic idea of the old British Empire is the spectre which is still stalking in this chamber to-night, and it is the spectre which will destroy hon. members opposite. [Interjections.] Just as South Africa and Britain&#x2019;s other former colonies destroyed that imperialism, so it will be rejected not only by the Whites in South Africa, but also by the Bantu in South Africa and, for that matter, by the world as well, for remember that even the Charter of the UNO provides for self-determination for the colonies of Britain, of which we were also one at one stage, and for all the peoples of the world. The policy of those hon. members has one dangerous aspect, and this is indeed what I am concerned about most, i.e. that it serves as a stimulus to the imperialistic Bantu in South Africa who is not satisfied merely with what is his own, but together with that party wants to lay his hands on what he can get, and on white South Africa as well. If agitators come forward in South Africa and say that they are not prepared to accept separate development, the hon. members opposite will have set them the example and will have to bear the consequences of the attitude they are adopting in regard to this Bill in this House this evening.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say this: If there has ever been a reason why hon. members opposite should be rejected on 22nd April, it is this irresponsible and reckless attitude which they are adopting in regard to this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Middelland says that this debate is providing a clear indication of the differences in philosophy between that side of the House, the Nationalist Government, and ourselves. Of course he is absolutely correct. This debate has indeed shown the difference in the basic philosophy between the two sides of this House. But, Sir, he is entirely wrong in his deductions. What has the hon. member for Middelland said? He has said that we on this side of the House, the United Party, consider South Africa to be one multi-racial state. That is perfectly correct, and any person who is prepared to see the facts of the present-day situation as they are must accept this. What does that side of the House say, Sir? They say, as the hon. member for Middelland was at great pains to tell us, that South Africa is made up of a number of separate nations. I should like to examine this for a moment, because this is the fundamental philosophy behind this Bill, which grants citizenship to the various Bantu nations, as the Nationalists like to call them. The essence of the argument of the Nationalist Party that the various Bantu peoples of this country, the Zulus, the Xhosas, the Tswanas, and so on, are separate Bantu nations, is based on two things. Firstly, there is the fact that they have separate languages, and secondly, so the argument goes, they have separate cultures. Let us look at this more closely. It is correct that these Bantu groups I have mentioned have separate languages. The argument is, however, not so strong when you speak of different cultures, because the different cultures are not so different. These groups do have different languages. We therefore come down to the fundamental fact that the Nationalist Party claims that the Bantu groups are separate mainly because they speak different languages. Let us take this argument to its logical conclusion. What do we find then? In a country like South Africa and in a country like the United States of America we find persons who are of french extraction, speaking French as their home language. We find people of Portuguese extraction whose home language is Portuguese. Then there are people who speak Spanish, Greek, and so on. To take the Nationalist argument to its logical conclusion, each of these peoples are within South Africa separate white nations. [Interjections.] Of course it is so, Sir.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#der_merwe">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>That is a stupid argument.</p>

<from><span class="col_1955-1956" refersTo="page_0992"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly, Sir. I agree with the hon. member for Middelland. It is a stupid argument. This is the very argument advanced by the Nationalist Party to justify their contention that the Bantu peoples of South Africa are separate nations. I challenge any member on that side who gets up to speak after me &#x2026; [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, they are not going to put me off by shouting me down. They must listen. I challenge every single one of them to deny that their fundamental reason for saying that there are different Bantu nations in South Africa is based mainly on a difference of language. Take that argument to its logical conclusion and you find that where there are different languages, you must acknowledge different nations. What will the position in South Africa be if we have to acknowledge different nations within the white peoples of South Africa simply because their home languages are different and they have to some extent certain different cultures based on their origins?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to deal with another argument of the hon. member for Middelland. He explained the historical development of this trend. He pointed out that from this trend stems the Italian State, the British State, the Greek State, the Dutch State, and so on. Of course, he is correct, but what he failed to tell the House was that in none of these states are there different nations based only upon differences in language. Let us take the United States, for one. The hon. member for Middelland paid a visit to the United States last year. He knows that in the United States of America, for example, there are very distinct language groups. There are French-speaking, Italian-speaking, Greek-speaking and other groups, all of whom are very proud of their own historical ancestry and customs. They maintain these customs. On the basis of his argument, all these groups must be accepted as being separate national groups within the one state. Sir, this is nonsense. Of course, there are different states with different languages, but you never find one state with different national groups in it, based on language differences.</p>

<p>The further fallacy of the Nationalist philosophy is that the so-called separate Bantu nations in this country, while they do have separate languages, as I have conceded, and to some extent separate cultures. do not all have separate territories, and I doubt whether they will have them under the Nationalist Government. But, above all. Sir, and this is the important aspect, they do not have separate economies. How can one possibly have a separate nation which can be developed to separate statehood when that group does not have its own separate economy? The whole thing is so fallacious that one can shoot holes in it</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I propose to come back to the Bill. What I should like to deal with just before I deal with the Bill specifically, if you will allow me, Sir, is one other aspect of the arguments we have heard during this debate. At this stage of the debate I think it is important to examine the arguments that have been put by the Nationalist Party to justify this Bill. In particular, I think we must examine why this Nationalist Government was so keen to get this Bill through the House before it rises prior to the forthcoming election campaign. No argument has been advanced to justify this haste. However, it has become clear from the arguments raised by hon. members on that side of the House, and particularly from the attacks on the United Party, that the reason for introducing the Bill at this stage is political, as can be expected. Every time an election is to be held this Nationalist Government comes forward with a &#x201C;swartgevaar&#x201D;-measure, some measure which they can use to prove to the electorate that they are carrying out this mandate that they tell us they have had from &#x201C;die volk daarbuite&#x201D; since 1948.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<p>Which they have done little about.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, a mandate that they have done very little about. This year they will not have the same opportunity. In the past this &#x201C;swartgevaar&#x201D;-horse has run very well for the Nationalist Party, and they have come to this Session of Parliament to introduce the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill and now the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Bill and they hope that the &#x201C;swartgevaar&#x201D;-horse will run well for them again. But it is not going to run for them this time because &#x201C;die volk daarbuite&#x201D; are not going to be misled by the Nationalist Party any longer. In this election they are concerned with their pockets; they are concerned with the high cost of living; the sales tax and so on. It is going to boomerang on them because their intellectuals, who are outside this House, of course, have been admitting that the Nationalist Party intend to create independent black states within South Africa. But what do their organizers and candidates say? They play this down for all they are worth, because they know that &#x201C;die volk daarbuite&#x201D; do not like this horse at all. They do not support the idea of independent black states. What are they then going to find with this Bill? How are they going to counter our propaganda that the only interpretation of this Bill which grants citizenship to every Bantu in <span class="col_1957-1958" refersTo="page_0993"/>South Africa is that it is the very important next step towards independent black states within South Africa? Let us have a look at this Bill. What will happen to the Bantu in South Africa from the day that this Bill is passed by this Parliament? In terms of clauses 2 and 3 every single Bantu in South Africa, whether he happens to be in the so-called homelands or in the white areas, and I want to stress this, becomes automatically a citizen of one or other Territorial Authority. I should like to know how the Nationalist Party is going to tell the electorate that although it has now granted a separate citizenship of the Bantu territorial areas, separate from citizenship of the Republic, to every Bantu, at the same time it does not intend to grant independence to black states. I should like the hon. member for Umhlatuzana who is not in the House at the moment or the hon. member for Klip River who is also not in the House this evening or the other hon. members representing Natal constituencies, to tell us how they are going to deal with this when we tell the electorate in Natal, who would not believe us in previous elections when we said that the Nationalist Party intended to create independent black states within South Africa, that this is so. This &#x201C;swartgevaar&#x201D;-horse that the Nationalist Party is going to try to ride in this election is going to boomerang against them. It is going to run in the wrong direction; it is going to run back to them.</p>

<p>We have had another curious scene during this debate. We have been told by the hon. member for Middelland that we are opposing this legislation because we are Imperialists. Mr. Speaker, did you think that you would see the day when this Nationalist Party would come to this House to sponsor dual citizenship? What about all the comments we had from that side of the House about dual citizenship and the fact that this was British Imperialism? They have forgotten about this. I see that the hon. member for Middelland is somewhat silent at this stage. I think that he was one of the most vociferous members in condemning the dual citizenship which this country had as part of the tradition coming down to us from Britain. Now, not only do they sponsor it, but the hon. member for Odendaalsrus spent half his speech quoting authorities to be able to tell us with approval that dual citizenship was such a wonderful thing and could be fitted in with the philosophy of this Nationalist Government.</p>

<p>I want to deal now with a very important aspect of this Bill. As I said a moment ago, once this legislation is passed, every single Bantu in terms of clauses 2 and 3 will become a citizen of a Territorial Authority. Now we come to the curious situation that in terms of 2(4)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A citizen of a Territorial Authority area shall not be regarded as an alien in the Republic &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is all very well. In terms of the proposed subsection (4) he is not regarded as an alien but nevertheless he is a citizen of a separate territorial authority, a citizenship which is entirely separate from citizenship of South Africa. It is deliberately separate, that is the whole object of this Bill. What is the situation in South Africa going to be as far as labour is concerned once this Bill is passed? The situation is perfectly clear. Once this Bill is passed by this Parliament every single Bantu in South Africa, in other words the entire Bantu labour force in South Africa, becomes a citizen of a territorial authority which is self-governing and, if we accept the Nationalist Party argument, will be developed to independent status. I want to refer to an editorial which appeared in the <i>South African Financial Gazette</i> which everyone knows is Government sponsored.</p>

<p>The hon. members appear to be a little nervous about this article. Some of them may know what is coming up. If they will just listen with a little patience, I will tell them what is coming up. This article appeared on the 10th April, 1968. It is an indication that this Bill which is to-day before the House was mooted by the Government as far back as this. I challenge the hon. the Minister to deny that what I am about to read out will be the effect, labour-wise, when this Bill is passed. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The bargaining power of Bantu workers in South Africa&#x2019;s economy, and the machinery through which it is expressed, has now become a matter of importance in the country&#x2019;s politics.</block>

<p>I have very little time left and I would appreciate it if hon members would allow me to finish this. I appreciate that they are nervous about what is coming, but they are going to hear it anyway. They then go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore, each of the different ethnic groups has a definite homeland and its own Bantu authority in that homeland.</block>

<p>That is what the Minister has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since it is the general policy of the Government that the citizenship of every Bantu worker in the country is associated with a particular homeland &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s philosophy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1959-1960" refersTo="page_0994"/>&#x2026; it follows that Bantu workers should look to their own authority and not to a white trade union&#x2014;which cannot take any cognizance of nationhood or of separate national authorities&#x2014;to negotiate on their behalf at a diplomatic level. Already a number of foreign Bantu work in South Africa on terms embodied in official international labour agreements. These agreements are the result of negotiations between respective governments, and cover all aspects of employment. The result is that there is no necessity for a trade union to negotiate on behalf of Bantu covered by such an agreement. Indeed, it would be in direct conflict with standing international practice.</block>

<p>Then the article goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The extension of similar labour agreements to the different Bantu nations living within the borders of South Africa seems to be a logical step in their development.</block>

<p>Will the hon. the Minister admit this, or will he deny or ignore it? Of course, he knows that this is the logical outcome of this Bill that we are passing to-day&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is one which should silence all future arguments &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then they go on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Such agreements, besides establishing conditions of employment, could also provide for labour diplomats to be appointed by the different Bantu nations in the main industrial centres of the country, to handle the affairs of their fellow-citizens who work there.</block>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, this is what we are coming to in terms of the Nationalist Party policy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition, the diplomats could possibly be allowed to arrange for national works committees in larger establishments to help them to keep in touch with their people.</block>

<p>Is this what is going to happen? Of course, how otherwise are they going to manage affairs? Then they go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These works committes should naturally be elected by Bantu workers belonging to a specific ethnic group from amongst their number, and could report all labour disputes to their labour diplomats who could, in collaboration with Bantu Affairs Commissioners, determine whether they are justified in terms of the provisions of the existing labour agreement, and if possible, endeavour to effect settlement.</block>

<p>The next paragraph I wish to stress very much. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If no settlement could be effected, the labour diplomats and Bantu Affairs Commissioners could refer the matter to their respective governments, in order that negotiations may take place at an inter-government level.</block>

<p>What a state of affairs this Government is leading us into by this Bill! Nothing could possibly justify this legislation.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to refer to a passage to which the hon. the Minister referred with such enthusiasm, in an article entitled &#x201C;A Transkeian Citizen of South African Nationality?&#x201D;, written in the <i>Tydskrif vir Hedendaagse Romeins-Hollandse Reg</i> by a certain professor. The hon. the Minister quoted this passage with great enthusiasm. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So, judging from these precedents, a future Transkeian Government may well be recognized by International Law as being capable of exercising functions of sovereignty &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x201C;Functions of sovereignty&#x201D;, not complete sovereignty&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which in its residual substance may remain with the Republic.</block>

<p>Now the hon. the Minister has quoted this passage with approval as being the type of status that he was creating under his Bill for these territorial authorities by creating Bantu citizenship for all the Bantu within South Africa. What is going to be the outcome if this view of international law is correct? The outcome is that the hon. the Minister is inviting the United Nations to treat these different Bantu territorial authorities as having a measure of sovereignty, despite the fact that there is a large measure of residual sovereignty in the hands of the white Republic. This is what the hon. the Minister is inviting the United Nations to do. He is suggesting that in terms of the law which he is creating, this is the situation which could arise and will arise when this Bill is passed, according to his argument, because he quoted this passage with approval. If this is what the hon. the Minister and his Government wish for South Africa, it certainly is not what we in the United Party wish for our country. We will certainly oppose this Bill with all the force at our command.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after debating this Bill for hours we have now reached the stage where one hon. member on that side has at least read the explanatory memorandum and has also read quotations from an article in the <i>South African Financial Gazette</i>, which gave him an insight into the policy of this side of this House. But most of those hon. members have not the least idea what is involved and what the policy of this Government is. I had hoped that, as this debate progressed, they would perhaps give us an alternative and state what their <span class="col_1961-1962" refersTo="page_0995"/>approach is. All I have been able to gather about what they have in mind, is that they want a conglomeration of nations, races, colours, odours and languages here. Then they will call all of them South African citizens. The self-realization of these people of different descent, tradition, language and culture is of no concern; they must simply be a conglomeration. That is all I have been able to gather.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Musgrave that this idea which he feels is quite alien to him, namely that there will possibly be dual citizenship, is in fact the position at the moment. The policy of the National Party on this side is that these Bantu territories must gradually develop. As they become able to accept more responsibility, they will be granted full independence. Time will tell when this must happen. But we accept the responsibility that these territories should eventually reach that stage. This measure now provides for certain rights to be granted to these people. In the first place they are identified not only with a language; they are also identified with a territory and with certain customs. How the hon. member can draw comparisons between the conditions in this country and conditions in the U.S.A., where there are limited groups of Germans, Italians and Portuguese, I do not know. He said that in that case these people should really also be able to obtain separate citizenship. To my mind there is no parallel at all. The position is simply that in this country and in the whole of Africa there are separate Bantu peoples with their own traditions, languages and so forth.</p>

<p>What the National Party is doing here, is to give statutory recognition to what has been traditionally accepted in this country all these years. I think it is a process which we should accelerate, if these people can develop quickly enough. Let us contrast this with the policy of that side of the House. They say these people, a conglomeration, are all accepted as South Africans. How will they do justice to that large group of non-Whites in the political sense? Let us consider their numbers and try to establish how many there are. I have last year&#x2019;s figures here, and I think it will be a good idea if hon. members on the other side listen to them. Last year there were approximately 3.5 million Whites in this country. The Xhosa population totalled almost 3.6 million, the Zulus 3.3 million, the Swazis 395,400, the Ndebele together with the North Sotho 1.5 million, the Tswana 1.1 million, the South Sotho 1.5 million, and in addition there are the Vendas and the Tsongas, who together number about &#x00BE; million. How will the Opposition, without providing for citizenship for these people in terms of an Act such as this one, give these large groups of separate Bantu peoples an opportunity to develop to the full? The only alternative is that they must attain political maturity in the white areas and must have the same political rights as the Whites.</p>

<p>At the moment the Opposition is saying that the Bantu will have eight representatives in this Parliament, representatives who will be Whites. This system can surely not be continued indefinitely. It is very clear to us that the only alternative is that those people will eventually have to capitulate and submit to the superior numbers of Bantu who will have to come here. Therefore it is our policy&#x2014;and we are very honest about it, as already stated in the National Party Constitution of 1914&#x2014; that we will guide every population group of this country and will do justice to them so that they will reach fulfilment. We have reached the stage where we have full development of the policy of separate development, of developing all groups along their own lines, or also called multi-national development, or whatever we want to call it. The fact of the matter is that we are not concerned with something fictitious here, but with the naked realities. Here are the figures, there are the people and there are the territories. We must take these facts into account. It is suggested that we are dealing in ideologies and that we are trying to bluff the white population of this country and are presenting things to them which are not really so. But what is more realistic than what is actually happening? What is really happening and what is a reality in this country are that we have eight very clear Bantu population groups, each with its own language, tradition and territory. These peoples must be guided to full independence in the distant future. This is an exceptional step to satisfy their political aspirations and to grant them political rights. If we argue that these people can be fused together in one large group under the name &#x201C;South Africans&#x201D; and will then be able to live together in peace, I think we will be bluffing ourselves. It cannot be anything else. When we analyse, we must not merely talk superficially about people. The fact of the matter is that these Bantu of the various population groups in South Africa have profound differences. These differences are not merely a question of colour; these differences are inherent and hereditary. Nor is it a question of inferiority or superiority.</p>

<p>The idea which is often bruited abroad by hostile people that the white man regards himself as superior and wants to keep these people inferior and in a subordinate position for all time, is quite untrue. The fact of the matter is that there is a difference which is inherent and hereditary. There are many good qualities in these people and there are also certain qualities which differ basically from those of the Whites in make-up, spirit, mind and the functioning of the entire being. Here these people will have the right as independent citizens in an independent state to develop according to their own nature and their own capacities. This side of this House has given those people the assurance, and with this legislation we intend granting these people citizenship so that nationalism can be fostered among them, as well as a love for what is their own, the language, the territory, the people and the traditions of each population group. <span class="col_1963-1964" refersTo="page_0996"/>This is something which can inspire them; they will then not have to live as an unmotivated conglomeration of people without any sense of purpose. I wish we can make the people on that side of this House who were in fact traditionally British and who were inspired by a nationalism such as almost no other country has ever known, realize that here in South Africa they are trying to begrudge it to other nations and to pretend that they do not understand it. They give out that we will have peace and will be able to develop beautifully together, and every time they place the emphasis on the economic aspect. As far as we are concerned, South Africa cannot develop economically at the cost of the soul and the nature of these different population groups, and especially not at the cost of the soul and the nature of the traditions of the Whites of this country. Therefore we have adopted this course and argue in this way. In our opinion it is only realistic and sound common-sense to approach this matter in this way. Why do we have the position that the rest of the world does not understand it? It is because they are not part of Africa and because they have not learnt to know Africa.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the various problems which arose when other states in Africa became independent, such as the civil war in Nigeria. Similarly, the conflict in the Congo was mentioned. What is the position there? Those events occurred because the states in Europe did not realize that they were lumping together different non-white races under one r&#x00E9;gime, races which differ very widely from one another and among which jealousy existed in many cases. The low level of civilization of those people resulted in their not being able to bear the responsibility which was imposed upon them. But let us look at other states which were established in the past decade. We know what happened in Cyprus, but let us consider a state such as Israel. On what basis was a state like Israel established? Only on the basis of religion, namely Zionism, and as a result of nothing else. However, hon. members on the other side say that we cannot establish non-white independent states here and guide them to maturity on the basis of language and culture. And yet in that case a state which is recognized by the United Nations was established on the basis of religion alone. Other unifying factors were added which have become a very important political factor. Therefore I want to emphasize very strongly that this side of this House is not at all afraid of accepting the responsibility for what we are doing here. We are granting only limited citizenship at this stage, but as these peoples develop, we must accept the responsibility to give it greater content and to give them everything implied by citizenship in the full sense of the word.</p>

<p>As set out in clause 2 (6) (b) of the explanatory memorandum, a positive value is now placed on citizenship, as in the case of the Transkei, for example the exercise of franchise rights in the territory concerned, apart from the other benefits, duties, rights and responsibilities which may follow on such citizenship. Such a citizen is not regarded as an alien in the rest of the Republic. This is what the position is going to be. There is nothing, as that hon. member tried to indicate, which will prevent negotiations about labour from taking place when, in years to come&#x2014;how long it will take we do not know&#x2014;these people achieve full independence. The ultimate goal of our policy, is, after all, that we should have the greatest possible measure of separation. These people will then be citizens of Bantu territories in this country which can achieve their independence. If they then have labour to sell to us, they will negotiate with us in regard to the basis on which they want to sell that labour. If they have something else to sell, they will also negotiate with us. Surely it is obvious that this will have to happen. Therefore I regard this as an important facet in the development of the basic policy of separate development in this country. It is a milestone which is so important that it will in future be regarded, as far as I am concerned, as one of the most important events of our time. I think the public outside cannot have the slightest doubt that it is the sincere intention of this side of this House to carry out this policy consistently. We do not doubt that the electorate outside will understand and accept this policy. It is in the interests of everybody.</p>

<p>In conclusion I therefore want to say that I congratulate the department and the hon. the Minister on having progressed so far in this matter. The insinuation is made that this has only been done with a view to the election. But last year there was no talk of an election and then this Bill was already on the Order Paper. References have also been made to another Act of the Deputy Minister which, too, was allegedly piloted through Parliament with a view to the election. But that was also on the Order Paper last year. Owing to lack of time it had to stand over until this year. I cannot see why it must stand over further now. I shall content myself with this. I think this is a very special event and a sign of progress in this country. It is especially in the interests of all the race groups which want to live together in peace in South Africa in the future.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Nelspruit, who has just sat down, made the point that this measure was not fiction. He said, &#x201C;Daar is die mense, en daar is die gebiede.&#x201D;&#x2014;There are the people, there are the areas. This is apparently a simple question of now giving the people the citizenship for the area. The people are there, he says. The area is also there. What is the problem? But, if it is as easy as that, why does clause 3 have to provide that citizenship will be determined fa) by where you were born, (b) by where you live, (c) by what language you speak, including any language belonging to an associated linguistic group and (d) by relation to any member of the Bantu population? In other words, <span class="col_1965-1966" refersTo="page_0997"/>the measure has to cover a wide variety of circumstances which have nothing to do with where you live, where you are or who you are. It covers people who, because they cannot be covered by this &#x201C;non-fiction&#x201D; of the hon. member, have to be covered by a fictitious measure. I want to describe this measure as the political LSD of apartheid. It is the political LSD which, it is hoped, will lift the public into some sort of cloud world, some dream world, where the lack of reality in the thinking of the Government will be counteracted by the lack of reality created by the political LSD of this measure. It can have no other purpose than to try to take people into some unreal world, because it does not apply to this world, to our world in which we live. It is a form of LSD for the Bantu too&#x2014;designed to hypnotize the Bantu into believing that they are going to get something out of this measure. However, in point of fact, all they will get is a little piece of paper dreamed up in the hazy cloudiness of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind as something which will now create reality out of the fiction of this policy. Therefore, for the white electorate it is a drug being fed to them to try and bolster the illusion of apartheid. And to the Bantu people it is a drug to make them believe they have something which in fact they do not have. It is an opium to make them feel they are receiving something and an opium to the white electorate to make them believe that apartheid can be made to work.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Nelspruit said that this was on the road to the development of full independence and that time would tell us when. What he fails to tell us and what the hon. the Minister and the Government fail to tell South Africa is, how will they control the time-table? Once they have started on this road how will they be able to control the time-table to independence? They have said that this is the road to self-determination. By what right do they then deny this self-determination to the people to whom they have made this promise? They have started on a road, they have put the Bantu people&#x2019;s feet on to an accelerator of a movement which the cannot control. They have taken their foot off the brake and they cannot control the development of that movement. The hon. member says that there is no alternative to this because otherwise the white people will have to capitulate to numbers.</p>

<p>There he confirms it: no alternative or the white people will capitulate to numbers. I am sorry that the hon. member for Pietersburg is not here because I would have liked to make this point to him. He says that if one has a small white population and a vast black population, then the Whites are outnumbered by Bantu. However, he says that if separate states are created for them with their own citizenship, the Whites are no longer outnumbered. In other words, if we have 13 million Bantu they outnumber the Whites. But if you have eight times 2 million, 16 million Bantu in a few years&#x2019; time&#x2014;which is a reasonable expectation&#x2014;the Whites are no longer outnumbered.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with another argument of the hon. member for Pietersburg. Firstly I wanted to deal with the nonsense that if you divide the Bantu into separate nations, they will not outnumber us. Then he said that one cannot live on bread alone. I should like to remind hon. members on that side of the House of a famous historian who wrote of Africa that he hoped that history would not record that while the Boer people thought they lost the Anglo-Boer War and while they thought they won the Battle of Blood River, in fact they had won the Anglo-Boer War and lost the Battle of Blood River. That is what is happening under this policy of this Government. Afrikaner Nationalism is rampant and victorious. The defeat of 1902 has now been avenged. So that war which they thought they had lost had been won. But the battle of Blood River which they thought they had won&#x2014;is that being won or lost to-day? The hon. member for Zululand is not here, but he could well talk of what will happen to Zululand under the logical consequences of this policy.</p>

<p>Throughout this debate member after member, starting with the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Rustenburg by interjection, has hammered on the fact that we are dealing with separate nations.</p>

<p>I want to refer to one of the earliest findings&#x2014;i.e. the finding of Heinrich Lichtenstein in 1808. In his paper, &#x201C;Bemerkungen &#x00FC;ber die Sprachen der S&#x00FC;dafrikanischen wilden V&#x00F6;lkerst&#x00E4;mme&#x201D;, he said that all linguistic types of the South African aborigines must be classified as dialects of either one or the other of these two principal classes. Those were Hottentot and Bantu. He further stated:</p>

<block name="quote">We are justified in considering all the inhabitants of the East Coast of Africa from 10 or 12 degrees South to the frontiers of the Dutch colony, as one nation.</block>

<p>I am quoting from page 55 of Heinrich Lichtenstein&#x2019;s analysis. As early as 1808 all the Bantu people on the East Coast south of the 12th degree, were regarded by him as one nation.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to Carl Richard Lepsius, who lived from 1810 to 1884. and who did the first grouping of Bantu people in South Africa. He found that there were basically three groups. They were the Original African Negro, under which the Bantu Negro and the Mixed Negro is classified, the Hamitic group and the Semitic group. Within the group Original African Negro he grouped the Bantu peoples who became the Bantu in South Africa, and this group was <span class="col_1969-1970" refersTo="page_0999"/>considered as one language group. I can go on quoting authority after authority. I can quote Needham Cust and Father Toreend, for example. I can quote this book page after page, and it comes to the inescapable conclusion that the Bantu form one nation and one linguistic group. I want to quote one of the latest subdivisions, this was made by Professor Lepsius and it was published in Berlin. Strangely enough, most of these authorities are German authorities. He divided the original African Negro into the sub-headings Bantu Negro and Mixed Negro. Under the Bantu Negro he classified the Herero, Mpongwe, Fernando Po, Kafir, Xhosa, Zulu Tswana, Sotho, Rolong and Swahili. Under the subheading Mixed Negro he brings in the Ibo group who have been mentioned by the hon. member for Middelland, as a different separate group. Besides the Ibo, the Mixed Negro Group consists of the Efik, Ful, Kanuri, Dinka and Shilluk tribes. Then there are still the Hamitic and the Semitic groups. I want to refer to the latest position. I quote from page 77 of &#x201C;The Growth of Comparative Bantu Philology&#x201D;:</p>

<block name="quote">The present position of our knowledge of comparative Bantu philology may be summarized tentatively as follows: The Semitic, the Hamitic, Sudanic and the Bantu family.</block>

<p>Once again the Bantu races of South Africa and Southern Africa south of the Congo are classified under the Bantu family.</p>

<p>I happened to take it as a major subject at the university, which I think is more than that hon. Minister did. That is why I know about these authorities. The language division between the Bantu race groups in South Africa has developed from a basic language, namely the language Ur-Bantu. If you make certain sound changes the Sotho and Zulu languages become one language. If I talk to the Deputy Minister here and say: &#x201C;Uyangizwa &#x2019;fundini?&#x201D;, he will understand me. He comes from the Eastern Cape. If I say to the hon. Maruti from Marico: &#x201C;Uyangizwa ukuti ngitini maruti?&#x201D; he will understand me. He comes from the North Western Transvaal. If I talk to my hon. friend on my right, he will understand me because he comes from Natal. We all understand each other when we speak Zulu whether we come from the Eastern Cape, the North Western Transvaal or Natal. If you speak to a Swazi, a Xhosa, a Pondo or a Matabele in Rhodesia in the same language, they will all understand you. Is the hon. the Minister going to tell me that the Ndebele of Rhodesia and the Zulu of Zululand are different nations with different cultures and different languages?</p>

But as soon as you take history back to any sort of beginnings of history then you must not do it. Then it is no longer history. Then you are being stupid. But as long as it suits the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s case history starts whenever they want it to start. They determine a date and say that 1913 is the start of Bantu homelands. They say that these historic Bantu homelands were born in 1913. But when they want to talk about Bantu culture and the cultural bonds then they go back further. When I bring in facts, hard linguistic facts which he cannot dispute, his only answer is that I am stupid. This is what the hon. the Minister said.

Does he know that there is such a thing as a Swiss nation where there are Germans, French, Italian and Austrians, forming one nation, the Swiss nation? Has he ever heard of a Belgian nation with Flemish and Belgians? Has he ever heard of a Canadian nation with French and English? And then he and his Government pretend to believe in a South African nation. How do you have one set of rules for the white man in Europe, another set for the white man in South Africa and a different set for the Bantu? If this is true, then it must apply equally whether it be to the English, Afrikaans or German speaking South African or to the Zulu, the Xhosa or the Swazi; these three particularly. Where does the Fingo come in who lives down in the Ciskei but who speaks a Zulu language and was chased out of Zulu-land by the Zulu? Where do we end with this sort of utter nonsense trying to pretend that you can tie every single Bantu by some invisible link to some mythical homeland and give him a piece of paper and say: &#x201C;You have now got the citizenship of a country.&#x201D; There are not even the countries to give them citizenship of.

<p>My hon. friend says what am I worrying about. I am worrying because I believe that this measure holds within it potential evil and danger to the future of white South Africa. I believe that this measure can be part of the destruction of the future of the white man in South Africa. In this measure we are deliberately destroying the loyalty of the black man to the power and authority of the white Government of South Africa. To-day there is one citizenship and that citizenship implies one loyalty and one authority. That is the authority of this Parliament. With that authority goes the power to ensure the safety and the security of the whole of South Africa. This Parliament, by claiming the right to govern South Africa, has the right to demand the loyalty and the obedience of all the people who live in South Africa. The fundamental evil of this measure is that it consciously sets out to destroy the loyalty of the black man to the authority of the white man in South Africa. This sets out to tell him that there is no longer any need for him to pay respect and accept and recognize the authority of the white man&#x2019;s parliament in Cape Town. This bit of paper makes him a citizen of a separate country, with his own government, his own flag, his own loyalty, his own parliament, his own foreign affairs and, if he does not like the S.A.B.C., his own tom-toms. This is a deliberate act of suicide which we are being asked to carry out, suicide of this country, if we pass this measure. That is why we are opposed to it. We are opposed to it for three basic reasons: (1) because of its danger to South Africa; (2) because it is bluffing the white electorate of South Africa; and (3) because it is holding out false hope for the Bantu people of South Africa. For those three reasons we strongly oppose this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Point) has already made good speeches in this House, and he has made worse ones, but I think that the speech he made this evening will certainly be remembered as one of his very worst. At one stage the hon. member tried to teach us. It is probably the most confused quoting of authorities I have ever listened to. The hon. member would probably make the worst lecturer one could possibly find. The hon. member tried to put across the biggest lot of nonsense here. For example, his argument boils down to the fact that everyone who understands Afrikaans, English and German belongs to one nation. That is what his argument boils down to. Now I should like to ask the hon. member: Is his argument that all nations using English as a medium are one nation? That is the ridiculous kind of thing the hon. member advocated here. The hon. member referred to Switzerland and to Belgium, but he need not have done so. He need only look at South Africa, where we have English-and Afrikaans-speaking communities in one South African nation. That argument can simply not hold water, Sir. It is also illuminating that this hon. member, who is very experienced, was so afraid of this Bill now before the House. His entire speech, particularly the end of it, evidenced the fear he is harbouring.</p>

<p>I shall still reply to what the hon. member said, but I should also like to align it with what the hon. member for East London (North) said. This evening he asked the question: &#x201C;Who asked for this legislation?&#x201D;. He asked it repeatedly. It is not the practice that legislation must always be asked for before a governing party will submit such legislation to the House. However, if the hon. member had just taken the trouble to read the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s speech, made in this House on 20th May, 1959, in which this matter was discussed very fully, he would have noticed that there was already a <span class="col_1973-1974" refersTo="page_1001"/>movement in this direction, and that this pattern had alread been clearly laid out at that stage. I just want to mention to him an example of someone who did, in fact, ask for this legislation. That person is Chief Lucas Mangope, chief of the Tswana, who asked, <i>inter alia</i>, for legislation incorporating this idea. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This policy, which we now have, a man like myself does not necessarily have to propagate. It speaks for itself. A man in my position is like a boy who said: I do not know what crime this man has committed. What I do know of him is that he gave me sight and through him I am once more able to see &#x2026; You see, Sir, we are the Tswana people. We have our own language which we love, which we respect, and would like to see respected. We have our own way of government, which we should like to see respected. We have our customs and our laws, which we respect and love, and which we would like to see respected and loved. The Natives&#x2019; Representative Council did not take this matter into consideration. It missed the root which was the cause of all these things. We are enriched in spirit to-day because of a policy which acknowledges us as a people with a respectable personality of its own.</block>

<p>This is now what a responsible Tswana, who is at present their Chief Minister, says. He is a man who is proud to be a Tswana. According to him that is what this policy of this side of the House means to him and to his people. I preferably take note of this Tswana leader&#x2019;s remarks than the remarks of some writers quoted by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District).</p>

<p>There is something else I want to refer to. The hon. member for East London (North) also asked: &#x201C;Who will defend our borders against communists?&#x201D;. This is more or less what his question boiled down to. I now want to read him another quote, and I think he can draw on this to determine what his own standpoint in this connection must be. On the same occasion Chief Lucas Mangope said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When one takes a look at Africa and sees the threat of wars and the attacks by other black people who say that they want to come here and liberate and emancipate other black people in this country, you do recall that Cain and Abel were in fact one man&#x2019;s children, yet the one killed the other.</block>

<p>Then he makes this illuminating remark&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then one&#x2019;s blood boils and one feels that if these people do come, &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is now the communists about which the hon. member is so concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I, my wife and my children, if we do not have weapons, will take stones and sticks and fight them.</block>

<p>That is what this Bantu leader says his and his people&#x2019;s conduct will be in respect of this so-called danger. This matter goes very much further. The question was asked: Who asked for this legislation? Who wants this kind of legislation? These are the typical questions of hon. members opposite who are not keeping pace with present-day realities. Sir, what is the position? To-day we find that Bantu leaders, and also those in the cities, come along and tell us that they want the recognition of an individual citizenship. They come and ask us this.</p>

<p>They did not come and ask Parliament. I am now speaking from personal experience. To that hon. member, who is now so talkative, I may just say that two or three days before I departed for Cape Town this Bantu leader came to my Office and asked me: &#x201C;Would you not, if possible, convey this standpoint of ours to the Minister and to Parliament? This is what my people and I ask.&#x201D; He is at present Chairman of the Bantu Advisory Council of the Potchefstroom Ikageng Bantu township. He is an elected leader who has been chairman for quite a few years. He is a man of whom notice can surely be taken. He came along to speak on behalf of his people. He said: &#x201C;Please tell your Parliament, for which I have the highest respect, that we want to see ourselves as Tswana. We want to be recognized as Tswana. We want our Tswana citizenship to be recognized.&#x201D; This idea of an individual pride, an individual nation and an individual citizenship, goes so far that these same people say: &#x201C;Why can we not obtain a school in our own area which uses only our own language? Why cannot only Tswana, English and Afrikaans be taught in the schools in our area? Why must it be a matter of other languages?&#x201D; I do not want to speak about that now, Sir. This is not the opportunity for expressing an opinion about that. These people even go as far as saying: &#x201C;We want a Tswana area influx control in respect of the other Bantu nations in South Africa. In other words, we do not want Xhosa in a Tswana township. We do not want Zulu or Venda here, unless it is necessary for us to have them here.&#x201D; Then hon. members ask who requested this kind of legislation. Such are the questions put to us.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>It did not form a part of the discussion. I do not now want to convey points that he did not ask me to convey. It was purely a private conversation, and as the hon. member himself realizes, one does not convey standpoints if one is not authorized to do so. I am now conveying what I am authorized to convey. These are surely positive signs of a nation in the process of maturing. I <span class="col_1975-1976" refersTo="page_1002"/>cannot understand hon. members opposite being so out of step with reality in respect of the Bantu people. I cannot see that this policy of the United Party in respect of this matter can mean anything but what General Smuts also meant by his holism. This idea of unity, that all are &#x201C;Africans&#x201D;, may have strategic value, but we are dealing with ethnological concepts here. Then the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) comes along with the alarming repetition of the militant idea of Bantu nationalism. On several occasions they have said that &#x201C;Black nationalism is becoming militant&#x201D;. He must have repeated it five times in his speech. If in future any problems arise in this connection, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) will hear more about this speech of his. This is not the first time this Session that he is using this concept of militant action on the part of black nationalists. He is wrenching the concept of nationalism altogether out of context. He does not want to see the positive and the attractive aspects of nationalism. We must think of the problems we are faced with in respect of communist actions, the moulding of thought and the tendencies within the Pan-African Organization in South Africa, which we must suppress, and in the people now sitting here on Robben Island. These are the people the hon. member wants to present as black nationalists. But he is altogether out of context with this idea. Nationalism is surely something fine and something positive. Surely it is not something subversive. The present position is surely not dangerous to the State. But now the hon. member comes along with this kind of speech in which he incites that black militant action, and I can only tell the hon. member that he is extremely irresponsible in that attitude he is displaying. I do not reproach the hon. member for referring to nationalism as &#x201C;an evil philosophy&#x201D;. He does not understand the concept, but what he does, in fact, understand about it, is that it looms before him and his party like a wall and is preventing them from ever governing in this country and from ever sitting on this side of the House. That is the most important reason why it is an &#x201C;evil philosophy&#x201D; for him and for his party. I shall reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint that independence and sovereignty are a requirement of citizenship. To a certain extent the hon. member for Mus-grave used the same argument as the hon. member for Durban (Point) used in respect of language. With reference to clause 3, in the light of what the Minister said in his second-reading speech, hon. members will see that they are backing altogether the wrong argument, because in clause 3 there is specific reference to the area where a person is born, where he is domiciled, to his language and then further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(d) every other Bantu person in the Republic related to any member of the Bantu population of that area or who has identified himself with any part of such population or who is associated with any part of such population by virtue of his cultural or racial background.</block>

<p>If they would only read clause 3 it would surely be clear, together with what the hon. the Minister said, that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument is not chiefly based on the question of language. It must be considered in conjunction with the other aspects of the matter. The statement was also made here by hon. members on that side, and in particular by the hon. member for Green Point, that the situation we are now in here is analogous to the situation in 1949 when the hon. members on this side of the House adopted another standpoint in respect of dual citizenship. It is surely not analogous, and I shall also go into that in detail. There is also another aspect that must be distinguished in that connection and that is: What is primary, nationality or citizenship? If one were to refer to the various authorities on this subject, one would find that in constitutional law citizenship is not identical with nationality in respect of international law. They are two separate concepts. In constitutional law a distinction is drawn between citizens having full political rights and others who are mere subjects, although the latter are also members of the state, enjoying its protection in international law.</p>
