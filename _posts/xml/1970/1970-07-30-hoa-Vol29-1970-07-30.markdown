<block name="quote">That as it is in the public interest that the accounts of the Committee appointed to organize the Water Year, 1970, a body which is not a statutory body, should be audited by the Controller and Auditor-General, this House in terms of section 58 (2) of the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1956, hereby requires the Controller and Auditor-General to undertake the audit of such accounts.</block>

<p>The Government decided to participate in the Water Year, 1970, and to contribute to the funds required for this purpose. Accordingly an amount of R250,000 was set aside for this purpose; R50,000 of this amount was voted for the financial year 1969-&#x2019;70, and the balance has been included in this year&#x2019;s draft estimates.</p>

<p>A special committee, called the Finance Committee, is dealing with the financial side and has already opened a banking account, while proper accounts are being kept of the financial transactions.</p>

<p>The Department of Water Affairs has now requested that the books and accounts of the committee be audited by the Controller and Auditor-General. The Controller and Auditor-General is prepared to undertake the audit, and as the State is making a considerable contribution, it is proposed that he should do so. The Controller and Auditor-General, however, is not empowered to do the audit unless Parliament, by resolution of both Houses, in terms of section 58 (2) of the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1956 (Act No. 23 of 1956), requires him to undertake the audit of the accounts.</p>

<p>Such resolutions have also been taken in the past in respect of, for example, the accounts of the Union Festival Committee and the Republic Festival Committee.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, during the course of the discussions on the previous stages of this Bill, reference was made by several hon. members to the demonstrations which were made available to members on both sides through the hon. the Minister and his predecessor and to explanations given by the Secretary (Mr. Du Preez) and by Mr. Fourie, his assistant. I want to say that we appreciated the explanations so far as the mechanical aspects of this scheme were concerned. There have been suggestions that we did not vociferously raise complaints with these departmental gentlemen but, Sir, it would have been most improper for us to have raised matters except for the purpose of obtaining elucidation as to what the scheme contains and what was envisaged, which we did. We posed our questions to them as to how they visualized this scheme would operate but the question of the advisability of this scheme as affecting the individual was obviously a matter for this House and is still a matter for this House and not for the officials, who merely carry out such legislation as is approved by this House. Sir, whilst we have had those explanations on the mechanical aspects and the administrative side of the scheme, we have now reached the third-reading stage and I must say that the hon. the Minister has not reacted satisfactorily to many of the suggestions made by us from this side to improve this legislation during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I think it should be understood by all hon. members that the scheme which we now have before us is a departure from the scheme as envisaged in 1968 and contemplated thereafter. It is an entirely different scheme, with basically only two things still retained and that is the register and some form of identification. Sir, at the previous stages of this measure we made our attitude quite clear and that still remains our attitude at this stage of the Bill. We accept the establishment of a central physical registry, and we regard it as a more convenient method of providing for the safe keeping of documents which relate to individuals. That registry has obvious advantages. The registry which will now be established will contain a record of the licences and other authorities granted to that individual citizen and will be accessible in the personal file. The hon. the Minister has given the assurance that that personal file will be regarded as personal and confidential in so far as that can be enforced administratively. There are obvious advantages in having this personal file, with all this information together in the registry, advantages from the point of view of defence purposes, civil defence and the extraction of particulars by the individuals concerned.</p>

<p>But, Sir, this registry could have been created without legislation; it is purely an administrative operation, and even at this stage, with a Bill as we have it before us now, there are voids in the administrative aspects of the Bill. No legislation is necessary to replace outmoded practices within a Department or with-in <span class="col_691-692" refersTo="page_0360"/>Government circles by modern business methods. I hope that it is a normal tendency within State Departments to brush up the administration. In fact I believe a call was made by the Prime Minister after the election, a call which fell on deaf ears, for a brushing up of administrative efficiency on the part of his Government.</p>

<p>Sir, we have expressed doubts, and these doubts still remain as to whether this system as a whole is practicable. We have expressed the fear that the scheme will absorb considerable funds and considerable manpower. Unfortunately after 20 years we have not been able to obtain from the Department or from the hon. the Minister any idea as to the cost to the country of the maintenance of the present register in terms of the Population Registration Act, and as this Bill comes before us at the third reading to-day we want to make it clear to the hon. the Minister that we on this side of the House will expect a careful record to be maintained as to the administration of this Bill, the cost of it and the manpower that is consumed in the administration of this Bill. It is true that the Secretary of the Department of the Interior does not present a departmental report to this House. In so far as his particular undertaking and its magnitude is concerned, we feel that the Minister should be warned at this stage that he will be faced with requests for information that has not been available in the past. We would like the hon. the Minister in the future to give us progress reports with regard to the application of this Act. We should like him to tell us to what extent these personal files have in fact been consolidated and to what extent they are complete in the register. This is a heavy task which, if this Bill is approved, will fall on the shoulders of the Department. Secondly, there is the question, a question of which we have no knowledge whatsoever, of the actual cost, both in money and in personnel, first of all to re-establish this register and then to maintain it in an effective state if it is to be of any use. We will also require to have information from time to time as to the efficacy of these change-of-address notifications.</p>

<p>Sir, we have reached the third reading of this Bill without any indication whatsoever from the hon. the Minister as to how many changes of address have been notified to the Department and have been incorporated in the register in the 20 years since the Population Registration Act was passed. We are being asked now to perpetuate this legislation to a greater extent, but for 20 years it has been an offence punishable by prosecution for an individual whose name is on the register to fail to notify his change of address. I want to suggest to the Minister that it would probably be an exaggeration to say that .001 per cent of the population have notified their changes of address to the Department. There are 6,500,000 identity cards under the law as it now stands. Unfortunately the Minister and his predecessors have kept no records and have no records available to tell us how many changes of address have in fact been registered over the last 20 years. Sir, if that has not been done over the past 20 years, then it is futile now to go on and to add further responsibilities with regard to notification of changes of address. The Minister has expressed the hope that there will not be requests for certified copies of documents. Some other system, which is still to be worked out by way of regulation, will be applied. Sir, we would like to know in future&#x2014;and we will ask the Minister for this information&#x2014;whether in fact there is any reduction in applications for loose copies of marriage certificates and birth certificates which are needed from time to time by various individuals.</p>

<p>As regards the remaining provisions of this Bill, we remain unconvinced that it should be passed in the form in which it now stands. The identity document will be bulky. It will contain documents and information which are unnecessary for the sole purpose of identification. The supply of information in the documents is purely permissive now and even if permissive entries are made, the documents will remain incomplete. The individual will not be relieved of the responsibility of retaining a host of other documents which are required by law, and it is unfortunate that the hon. the Minister in selecting the items to be included in the document did not cover the whole field. Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the retention of documents by the persons concerned. It is very interesting to know that the employer of a Bantu servant has to comply with three requirements. He has to satisfy himself that the Bantu has a certificate of employment; he must pay a monthly employment fee and a monthly residence fee. And so one could go on to a multitude of documents if the Bill was designed to give effect to a filing system for the multitude of documents which have to be carried by the individual. We shall in this regard, as I said before, ask the Minister for details in regard to the practicability of this Bill if it is adopted by the House, because we see grave difficulties in making this work in any effective manner.</p>

<p>I want to refer to one final matter on which, during the course of the debate, the hon. the Minister has given us assurances which we naturally accept, namely that attention will be given to avoiding unnecessary prosecution under this Bill of juveniles for failing to comply with its terms in regard to applying for documents. We have asked the hon. the Minister to see that that was put into the Act, but unfortunately he has again declined to accept an amendment to put in that statutory safeguard which we would have preferred. The Bill as it now is, is as unsatisfactory as it was when we opposed it at the second reading for the reasons which have been stated during this debate, and we now see no reason for changing our attitude. Therefore we oppose the third reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#van_breda">

<from><span class="col_693-694" refersTo="page_0361"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>It is interesting to note that the hon. member for Green Point&#x2019;s objections were reduced to only a few after they obtained the information in the Committee Stage. If I may now summarize what I consider to be the chief objection at this stage, I want to state that, in the first place, this objection involves practicability. The hon. member for Green Point has now indicated that, as far as they are concerned, there is no real objection to this central register, and that they accept the principle, but then he goes so far as to say that this part of the administration could have been carried out without any legislation whatsoever. This is an interesting thought, but now the hon. member comes along and contradicts himself in the very next thought he expressed, in the sense that he nevertheless has doubts about the practicability of the register&#x2019;s compilation. In the first place I want to dwell briefly on the practicability, because this is linked, more than anything else, with the question of the individual&#x2019;s change of address. Their other objection is against the identity document as such, which is supposedly now going to violate the individual&#x2019;s privacy.</p>

<p>I first want to come back to the question of change of address. In the Second Reading, and also in the Committee Stage, the hon. the Minister indicated that the corner-stone, as he called it, of this whole system was based on the co-operation of the public, in the sense that the public will have to be compelled to give notice of their changes of address. If that basic element is not complied with, then the rest of the legislation is, in actual fact, null and void. In now expressing his doubts about the practical measures being taken to bring that obligation home to the individual, in expressing those doubts and saying that legislation was not necessary in the establishment of the central register, the hon. member is obviously contradicting himself. Each of us realizes that the provision being made in this Act for changes of address, and the obligations being placed upon the individual and other persons in that connection, inevitably cannot be our final answer to that problem. We realize only too well that in practice we shall still probably pick up quite a few problems in respect of the changes of address, but this is specifically where the task lies, a task not only for the Government, but in particular for the Opposition as well. The nature of this task is that we should give positive information and encouragement to our people, over whom we have control and to whom we have access, to comply with these basic obligations. It will be no use our coming here to a second or third reading, shrugging our shoulders, throwing our hands in the air and saying that the people are in any case not going to do this. Our task is to ensure that the people are informed, so that they know that they must comply with those obligations.</p>

<p>I think the Opposition realizes the practical benefit of this legislation. I think they realize that by means of this Act a large portion of the State machine is being streamlined so that one may improve the performance of certain duties and so that one may, in a practical manner, furnish the public with a better service. Since it is specifically they who proclaim from the roof tops, as the hon. member did once more this afternoon, that this Government created chaos in its administration, that it is obsolete and ineffective, I want to draw the conclustion to-day, and I believe I am justified in doing so, that the Opposition&#x2019;s resistance to this legislation is based purely on political considerations, i.e. that they do not want to ensure the streamlining of Government administration, in order that they may continue with agitation whenever a man cannot obtain a birth certificate quickly enough, so that they can attribute this to poor administration by the Government. For that reason they will not co-operate in this legislation and would much rather sow suspicion about confidential matters which will now be made public, etc. The plain and simple basic task which will be imposed upon our people will merely involve the notification of changes of address, and all that the Opposition, on its part, has to do is to contribute towards educating the public in that respect.</p>

<p>I can now imagine that the obligation placed on home owners and house agents, in respect of the tenant&#x2019;s address, could become quite a simple matter in practice. I imagine that when a tenant has to come along to the lessor or the agent to sign his lease, it would be normal procedure for that person to assist the tenant in his change of address. That story to the effect that it would now be necessary to give this book to the caretaker, who could ferret through the whole thing in order to have the address changed, is a little far-fetched. The hon. member for Durban (Point) came to light with quite a few practical suggestions, and it is just a pity that he tried to present them in a negative way. He asked why we did not link the question of change of address, for example, to the provision of electricity, so that when a man applied for electricity to be supplied to a certain address, this should be linked to his change of address. I want to agree with him that there could be such a measure, and likewise there could quite possibly be several other measures which could also be incorporated into this system, if we do not succeed with the basic system for which provision is now being made. But I nevertheless want to express the hope that all our Government Departments will eventually be adjusted to the identity number of the individual, and that there will be the necessary liaison between these departments and the central register, because from time to time people must, of necessity, notify certain departments of changes of address, for example the Receiver of Revenue. There must be this liaison between the Receiver of Revenue and the central register when these people obtain new information about changes of address. But I foresee that these identity documents and the central register could become such an integral <span class="col_695-696" refersTo="page_0362"/>part of our life pattern that these problems that we now anticipate solving within the space of five years, will, in fact, be solved, so that people will eventually refer with pride to this document, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) now refers with pride to the identity card he is carrying around with him.</p>

<p>As far as the document itself is concerned, we believe that it will eventually become very popular with the public, popular in the sense that one will now have here a combination of all the documents one may need from time to time, essential documents which at this stage are scattered around to quite an extent. Sir, if you were to ask me to-day where my birth certificate was I would not really know. [Interjections.] Whether the hon. member for Durban (Point) ever received one, I do not know. Equally, I would not know where my marriage certificate was if I were asked. I took out my present driver&#x2019;s licence when I was still a fine young lad. To-day I can virtually not recognize myself. In this book you will therefore resemble your present self more closely.</p>

<p>The doubts expressed about scratching in people&#x2019;s private affairs are only flights of the imagination. Hon. members have had the opportunity of seeing the format of the proposed document. The data contained in it is arranged in such a way that when one is required to prove one&#x2019;s identity one could do so by just showing the first page. The other information is therefore not visible. The same applies to any other information required from you&#x2014; only that is visible at that particular moment. Hon. members objected to ladies having to reveal their ages in future. The hon. member for Durban (Point) almost waxed lyrical about this. But the days when a lady was ashamed of her age are long past. In the enlightened times we are living in to-day measurements and weight count for far more than age. Just look at how to-day&#x2019;s young ladies are tinting their hair grey to achieve the maturity of age which goes with the measurements and weight. As I see it, the only persons who may be detrimentally affected by the carrying of such a document, are those old wolves who gad about with young girls and who may now be asked to produce their documents. That is the only disadvantage I can see in this document.</p>

<p>There is one advantage of this system that we here must perceive, particularly because we are now involved, i.e. its use for election purposes. Hon. member who could attend the demonstration in Johannesburg at the time, had an insight into the possibilities of the system in this regard. For example, the voters&#x2019; roll could be compiled at very short notice, i.e. if changes of address are kept up to date. We would therefore no longer need to wait six months for a voters&#x2019; roll when a lightning election has been decided upon. Under this system the compilation of a voters&#x2019; roll could take place at short notice. And this could be done in a way which would satisfy the political parties. For example, some of us want it alphabetically, while others want it in street order. And when we have such a fresh voters&#x2019; roll, on which the names of all must, of necessity, appear, it is going to facilitate postal votes. If the voters&#x2019; roll is in street order and one comes to a number where a person lives Who does not belong there, one knows immediately that this is a case for a special or postal vote. Here the identity document will be of assistance. When a voter gives notification of his change of address, he will be notified of his constituency and his polling district. This will eliminate the present-day confusion when, after a general delimitation, people sometimes have no idea in which constituencies they fall. Under this proposed system a person will know where he is registered, and he may go along to any presiding officer, produce the necessary slip, and exercise a special vote. The benefits and the savings of the proposed system in this connection are legion.</p>

<p>Hon. members inevitably strongly emphasized the question of expense. I do not want to venture into that like the hon. member for Orange Grove did yesterday&#x2014;he is a specialist when it comes to juggling with figures. I think we may nevertheless accept that the initial expenses will be extraordinarily high, but then we must remember that these will not be repetitive expenses. What is more, the services to be eliminated by this system will in themselves be a tremendous saving. In a debate last year the hon. the Minister of the Interior mentioned the cost of arranging a general registration, and in spite of that, as we know, we still do not obtain a correct voters&#x2019; roll. Interim registration could also be eliminated in future.</p>

<p>Then there is still the question of manpower. Owing to other obligations the hon. member for Green Point could, unfortunately, not attend the demonstration which the Department arranged for us. Therefore he could not see how changes of address are going to be done. It is actually done by only a few persons, because a computer is used for the purpose, as well as a microfilm on which millions of names are stored and from which, by the press of a button, one can obtain particulars in a fraction of a second. Work by hand is therefore largely eliminated.</p>

<p>In conclusion I cannot neglect to praise the officials, who provisionally investigated this system and prepared a basis for this legislation, for what they did in this connection. I think we have here a piece of legislation which is going to give us the lead over many other countries who ought, in fact, to be leading us in this respect. That is the reason why we wholeheartedly support this Third Reading.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have opposed various sections of this Bill on various grounds, but essentially because we are concerned about the liberties of the individual and are afraid that this measure might bring encroachments on the freedom and liberty of the individual. We are concerned about safeguarding his personal dignity <span class="col_697-698" refersTo="page_0363"/>and privacy. We are also concerned about the practicability, the convenience and cost of the procedure being introduced by this Bill. Our attitude to it has been clearly stated by the hon. member for Green Point, and he has explained in detail why we are not entirely satisfied. We recognize that the intention of this Bill is to introduce new methods of efficiency, of streamlining and mechanization. But we feel that these aims, desirable though they may be, should not override the importance of the maintenance of personal freedoms and dignities. We shall, therefore, continue to be vigilant about these things and watch the operation of this measure with great care.</p>

<p>I should now like to refer to a different aspect, to what I may call an inadvertent feature of the Bill. I refer to clause 16 and particularly to paragraph (k) of subsection (1) which provides that the State President may make regulations in regard to the issue of certificates or particulars contained in the register or in an identity document, the purposes for which such certificates may be used, and the <i>evidential value</i> of such certificates. This seems to me to be an unfortunate use of words.</p>

<p>The &#x201C;evidential value&#x201D; of a certificate appears at face value to refer to the value in evidence of such a document. One is inclined to see this as a reference to the value of the document when produced in a court of law and when it is judged as a piece of evidence.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, we are very jealous of the independence of our judiciary. We know that the courts have their own rules, their own laws and their own precedents for judging the validity of evidence brought before them. It is certainly not the task of the executive to state or to dictate to the courts how they should judge the falsity or the truth of evidence laid before them, how they should judge the correctness or the incorrectness of such evidence. It alarms me therefore that these words might be misinterpreted. It might be that they will be misinterpreted in the future by civil servants or by courts before whom these words are brought and who did not have the benefit of the explanations which the hon. the Minister gave us last evening. I think the Bill should say what it means. I am fully satisfied that the hon. the Minister was entirely genuine, when he explained the position last night, in saying that the purpose of this subsection is to provide that these documents, when produced, should have authenticity or official validity. In other words, he intends that the State President should be empowered to make regulations establishing the <i>official validity</i> of these documents, so that they may do the things which they purport to do. I am quite sure that it was not the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention to produce, as a kind of by-product to this Bill, an encroachment on the independence of our courts.</p>

<p>It is rather late in the day to produce an amendment and I do not propose to do so. I am also not entirely sure whether it will be possible to do so because these words occur in a subsection which was put up for amendment last night and was rejected. I would however like to make a constructive suggestion in this respect. The hon. the Minister will be piloting this Bill through Another Place. If he agrees that the proposal I have made and the argument I have put forward have some merit and some validity I appeal to him to take that opportunity to put this right by substituting words which we feel would clarify the situation and protect the country against something which is unintended but which has the seeds of a dangerous situation in it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin with the objection which the hon. member for Von Brandis raised against the proposed section 20 (1) (k). It appears that his anticipation of the danger is actually, and I say this with respect to the hon. member, a blunder. We have numerous statutory regulations which regulate the value of certain State documents. Those provisions usually mean that a document which appears on the surface to be a true copy, signed by the relevant person mentioned in the provision, is <i>prima facie</i> proof of the information contained in it. This is all one could anticipate would happen when the State President is able to define the value of this certificate in terms of the powers afforded him by clause 16. One does not see anything sinister in that. It is <i>prima facie</i> proof. This means that it is proof on the face of it, but that proof could still be refuted in our courts by any additional evidence. I do not think the hon. member need feel oppressed in respect of the matter he touched upon under this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this population register to which we are giving final shape at present will be a population register which one would actually find only in a modern state where one&#x2019;s body politic is keeping pace with modern developments. I personally cannot believe that such a population register, as envisaged, could in any way have been possible at a time when computers did not exist. Thanks to the advent of the computer this register is made possible. Thanks to the computer one can, by means of 13 figures arranged in a particular manner, store up for every citizen in South Africa certain data which can in fact be made available within seconds by pressing a few buttons. With this development, if for some or other reason John Citizen cannot use his book, and must have recourse to his register, the whole procedure of filling in forms and so on is eliminated, because by presenting his number all the information he desires about himself can be obtained. Here the State could also, by way of pushbutton selection, obtain a wealth of information within a question of minutes, or perhaps a little longer, simply because the register had been established. The hon. member for Tygerberg has already elaborated <span class="col_699-700" refersTo="page_0364"/>on this. As was indicated, this could be done in a street, regional, age or sex context.</p>

<p>To come along then and say that this does not justify the expense, is far-fetched. This information, which can be stored in a computer, is there specifically to reduce expenses. Among other things the aspect of expense to the man in the street is going to be reduced, owing to the fact that he no longer has to pay for copies of the certificates he wants. He will simply need to take his book to a magistrate to have a certified copy made of any document that he wants a copy of. I want to reject the idea of high costs altogether. This computer is going to make a number of clerical personnel redundant. It is not going to make them jobless. It is going to make them available to other fields of Government administration or to the private sector, where there is at present a shortage of these people. In this connection one thinks of the enormous staff the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths needs in order to keep all the necessary entries up to date.</p>

<p>I also foresee that possible faults could hereby be eliminated. From time to time it is brought to one&#x2019;s attention that a marriage certificate, a birth certificate or some other certificate is faulty, merely as a result of an oversight. As a result of one small figure incorrectly written down, confusion could result. Here we have eliminated that confusion through the person&#x2019;s number being linked to his date of birth, and one could therefore easily refer back to the documents in the register.</p>

<p>Sir, I also believe that it would also relieve the burden of the manpower shortage in the Department as such. I think that the Department concerned suffers greatly from this shortage. This register will make it possible for a few people to do the work of many. The Opposition strongly opposed this legislation. The hon. member for Green Point tried to indicate this afternoon why the Opposition had actually gone back on its decision. I do not want to look for any more trouble with him about that, except to tell him that as far as I am concerned, his excuse still does not hold water. In conclusion I now want to ask the hon. member: If in the far distant future his party were ever to come into power, and if he were perhaps to become Minister of the Interior, would he abolish this legislation? Would he nullify these measures, which we are now accepting? I wonder if he would tell the speaker who is to follow me what his attitude is, because if he would abolish it we would know on the eve of the provincial election that the United Party will abolish this population register, if by chance they were to come to power one day. The hon. member may now tell us if he would do so. I do not believe that the Opposition would do it.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can understand that the Opposition is beginning to appreciate the mechanical aspects of this population register and the identity document system, because it is impossible for any clear-thinking person to argue against the logic of a system such as this. This system is the result of very thorough investigations. It is based on the best system we could find in the Western European countries. It is intended to be to the benefit of South Africa and its people. Therefore one can understand why the Opposition has at last given up the struggle of arguing about the mechanics, as they call it. However, because they want to oppose the measure on account of certain ulterior political motives, they resort to a number of fallacious arguments, one of which is that this is a deviation from the old system. They are apparently referring to the original proposal that passports be incorporated. As I have indicated, this was changed because the incorporation of the passport in this &#x201C;I.D.&#x201D; was found to be unpractical. This should be clear to those hon. members as well. This measure is therefore not a deviation. The measure before this House is actually an extension of the existing system, in order to meet the needs of a modern state. If one thinks of the tremendous population growth in our own country and of our economic and scientific developments, one must begin to realize what the position will be in twenty years&#x2019; time, and what the need will then be to gain better control and to obtain the data required to ensure proper planning for the future. It has been said that we could have extended this register without legislation. That is of course absolute nonsense. In terms of this measure a number of statutory obligations are being imposed on the individual, which was not the case with the old measure. Statutory obligations are also being imposed on the co-responsible persons who will assist with the changes of address, about which a big fuss was made yesterday. For that reason it is obvious that a measure such as this is necessary. The other fallacious argument resorted to by the Opposition was whether it would be practicable. I think the hon. members must take note of the way we are governing the State at the moment and must take into account the findings in connection with this investigation. The Opposition will now have to try to muster its confidence.</p>

<p>Yes, time will tell, but we are prepared to withstand the test of time. For that reason I should like to tell the hon. members the following. The hon. members said that they would examine this critically. I would welcome it if the Opposition took a critical look at the expenditure involved in this, the manpower position this would entail and the effectiveness of this. The Opposition&#x2019;s critical examination of these matters would also have its advantages and would help to expand knowledge of this system further. If the hon. members want to debate this matter annually on the appropriate Vote, I personally <span class="col_701-702" refersTo="page_0365"/>will welcome it. The hon. members will be able to do so on the basis of the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report. It is not only the hon. members on that side of the House who will examine the financial expenditure involved in this. The Controller and Auditor-General will examine it, even before the hon. members do, and he will report on it.</p>

<p>The main reason is that we have not had a computer system until the present time. Only now that we can switch over to a computer system and with the present manpower position are we able to keep the system up to date. Because of our manpower shortage, we could not keep the present register in the form in which we would all have liked to keep it, i.e. up to date and with the latest changes of address. With this computer system and with the statutory obligations introduced by this measure involves, we see our way clear to keeping this system up to date in future.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that I shall welcome a critical examination by the Opposition. It can only contribute towards making this system better known and also better appreciated. This system will be a great asset to South Africa, because basically it is intended to serve this modern expanding state and the people of South Africa.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is related to the Population Registration Amendment Bill, which we have just passed. By way of introduction I should like to mention that it is being proposed that the envisaged new system of population identification which will be introduced in the Republic should also be applied in the Territory <span class="col_703-704" refersTo="page_0366"/>of South-West Africa. I have already, during the discussion of the Second Reading of the Population Registration Amendment Bill, given an extensive elucidation of the planned system, as well as the benefits which it will entail for the State and for the public, and I am not going to reiterate them here. However, I can just mention that the system will also result in the same benefits for the inhabitants of the Territory. The Administration of South-West Africa, of course, welcomes the application of the envisaged system in the Territory.</p>

<p>It was, however, decided not to make the Population Registration Act, which deals with classification of the population as Whites, Coloureds and Bantu, applicable to the Territory, and that is why it is therefore necessary to introduce a separate Bill which will make possible the issuing of consolidated identity documents to the inhabitants of South-West Africa. Because it would be undesirable and also unpractical, however, to maintain a separate central register and address bureau for the Territory, provision is being made in the Population Registration Amendment Bill for the inclusion of the names and of certain particulars of those persons in South-West Africa to whom identity documents have been issued in terms of this Bill. In this regard hon. members are referred to clauses 3 and 5 of said Population Registration Amendment Bill. It will be noted, however, that the other provisions, except section 10 (clause 7) with regard to notification of change of address, of the Population Registration Act will not be applicable to the inhabitants of the Territory. In addition, this Bill was published for general information and for comment in the <i>Gazette</i> and it has also been upon the Table of this House for some considerable time now. By this time therefore hon. members should be fully conversant with its contents.</p>

<p>I nevertheless want to make use of this opportunity to furnish a brief explanation of the clauses concerned. Clause 1 comprises the definition of certain terms used in the Bill, and is self-explanatory. In regard to the definition of &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; however, I should like to mention that the definition has been framed in such detail in order to make provision for delegation. In clause 2 provision is being made for the issuing of identity documents to the inhabitants of the Territory, and it also provides what particulars those documents may contain. The particulars are the same as those which will be included in the identity documents of persons in the Republic. In addition, the particulars concerning his marital state, paragraph (e), the particulars of immunisations which may be added, paragraph (f), and particulars concerning his blood group, allergies, etc., paragraph (g), will only be furnished in a person&#x2019;s identity document if he so desires.</p>

<p>In addition a proviso has been included, i.e. that the particulars as referred to in paragraphs (k) and (1), i.e. those dealing with elections, will only be included in the identity document after a date fixed by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i> The reason for this is that the identity document cannot be utilized for election purposes before every voter or potential voter is in possession of such document and it has been established that the particulars in the register are fundamentally correct and are being kept up to date.</p>

<p>Just as in the Republic an identity document will also be issued to a child immediately after the registration of his birth in the place of a birth certificate. However, this document will lapse when he attains the age of 16 years, and he will then have to make application for the more comprehensive identity documents in respect of a person of the age of 16 years or more, and furnish the necessary photographs.</p>

<p>Clause 3 provides that an identity number shall be assigned to every person to whom an identity document is issued. The identity number shall also be compiled out of figures and shall consist, in addition to a serial and a control number, of a reproduction of the prescribed particulars, and no other particulars whatsoever, of the person to whom it has been assigned. The identity number for the inhabitants of the Territory of South-West Africa will be the same as that for the inhabitants of the Republic of South-West Africa, except in respect of race classification because, as I have already said, the Population Registration Act will not be applicable to them. Instead of race classification the population group and not the race group, in other words, Nama, Baster, etc., to which a person belongs according to the information which he himself has furnished, will be included in the identity number. For this reason, it is being proposed that the information which the identity number will contain, or out of which it is compiled, shall be prescribed by regulation.</p>

<p>As hon. members will note from subclauses (3) and (4) of clause 10, any regulations made in terms of this Bill shall be laid upon the Table in the Senate and the House of Assembly, which therefore entails that Parliament will have a say in this matter; that is, will be able to accept or reject them.</p>

<p>Clause 4 makes provision for the furnishing of relevant particulars with a view to the issuing of identity documents. It is provided herein that every person, or in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 16 years, his guardian, shall furnish the Secretary with the particulars which are required for the issuing of his identity documents on the prescribed forms. In the case of the birth of a child the notification of his birth is deemed to be the furnishing of the particulars for the purposes of this clause.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with photographs. In subclause (1) it is provided that every person to whom an identity document is issued in terms of clause 2. except a person under the age of 16 years, shall, at his own expense and as often as it is or becomes necessary to issue an <span class="col_705-706" refersTo="page_0367"/>identity document to him, or when the photographs which such person has furnished are no longer a recognizable image of the person concerned, furnish the Secretary with two copies of a recent photograph of himself.</p>

<p>Subclause (2) provides that one photograph shall be placed in the identity document and that the other copy shall be filed in the register.</p>

<p>All that is being done in clause 6 is to state the requirements in regard to the surrender of identity documents which contained particulars which are incorrect, and does not require any further elucidation.</p>

<p>Clause 7 deals with the notification of change of postal address and residence. In subclause (1) an obligation is being imposed upon the person in respect of himself or his ward to notify the Secretary in a prescribed way within fourteen days, or in a particular case, such longer period as the Secretary may allow, of any permanent change in the place of residence or postal address.</p>

<p>The proposed provisions in subclauses (2) and (3) are control measures, and those in subclauses (4) and (5) consequential provisions. These are being proposed in order to ensure that the statutory requirements in this regard are complied with.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that without the addresses of the members of the population, the value of the central register will be restricted and the address bureau will be virtually useless. Notification of change of address by persons to whom identity documents have been issued is therefore indispensable for the proper maintenance of the address bureau. It is realized that it cannot be expected that each and every person will comply with the statutory requirements in this regard from the very outset, nor is it the intention to take drastic steps in a summary way. It is expected that the issuing of identity documents to the present population will extend over a period of approximately five years if nothing unforeseen occurs&#x2014;after its commencement on 1st June, 1971&#x2014;and this will go hand in hand, I want to emphasize, with intensive instruction of the public, over the radio, through the Press and through the other communication media in order to ensure that our people are properly informed in regard to this system and as to what it entails, what it signifies to them and what the requirements in that regard are. In many other countries, the introduction of this identity document system produced very few problems. In fact, in many countries where we instituted investigations almost no problems had been encountered. The people had been properly informed regarding the matter: they had been fully prepared for the introduction of the system and I have no doubt that our population, which is also a reasonably well-informed population will in due course have a full understanding of this system and come to appreciate it.</p>

<p>Clause 8 deals with the production of identity documents and the provisions in subclauses (1), (2) and (3) are basically the same as those laid down in clause 10 of the Population Registration Amendment Bill, 1970. Subclause (4) is deemed necessary because it is foreseen that the State President will be asked to make the production of identity documents compulsory, <i>inter alia,</i> in the following circumstances&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) to immunizing officers when children are being immunized against poliomyelitis and smallpox;</li>

<li>(b) to licensing authorities when the firearms licences or drivers&#x2019; licences are being issued; and</li>

<li>(c) to marriage officers by the prospective marriage partners.</li>

</ol>

<p>It will however be possible to grant exemptions in terms of the provisions of clause 12.</p>

<p>Clause 9 provides that except in certain cases the particulars in the register and identity documents may not be published or communicated. However, the Secretary may, under certain circumstances, in fact do the following. He can&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) furnish any Department of State, any local authority or statutory body, for any of the purposes of that Department, authority or body, with any particulars recorded in the register and address bureau in relation to any person to whom an identity document has been issued; and</li>

<li>(b) on payment of any fee which may be prescribed, furnish any person upon written application by him with any particulars recorded in the register and address bureau in relation to any person, provided the Secretary is satisfied that it is in the interests of the last-mentioned person that such particulars be furnished.</li>

</ol>

<p>In clause 10 the necessary powers to make regulations vested in the State President are laid down, and these are also so obvious that they do not at this stage justify any explanation. We can though, if necessary, discuss them in the Committee Stage. Attention should once again be drawn to the fact that all regulations which will be made, must be laid upon the Table in both Houses of Parliament, and are therefore subject to the approval and/or disapproval of Parliament.</p>

<p>Clause 11 contains the offences and penalties which most certainly need not be dealt with now in detail either.</p>

<p>In clause 12 it is provided that the State President may by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> exclude, for a specified or unspecified period, from the provisions of this Act, or exempt, <span class="col_707-708" refersTo="page_0368"/>for a specified or unspecified period and either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as may be prescribed in the proclamation, from any specified provisions thereof, any class of persons, and may in like manner amend or withdraw any such proclamation. In this connection I should like to explain that the registration of the Native nations of the Territory; the Ovambo, the Okavango, the Kaokolanders, the East-Caprivians, the Hereros, the Berg Damaras and the Bushmen, will be the responsibility either of that nation&#x2019;s own authorities or of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. A system which is fundamentally the same as the one envisaged in this Bill can be developed and applied to all, with this difference that the administrative authorities of such ethnic grouns will themselves exercise responsibility for the application thereof, as has been foreseen in the Development of Self-Government for Native Nations in South-West Africa Act. It may therefore be necessary to exempt the Native nations of the Territory of all or some of the provisions of this Bill. The same can in future also apply to the Nama and Baster nations, but it is the intention, from the very outset, to make the same identity documents available to members of the latter two ethnic groups and the Coloureds and white groups. It may however he necessary to exempt members of the Nama and Rehoboth nations from the provisions of clause 7, the provision relating to notification of changes of address, if such members change their address in their own respective territories.</p>

<p>Clause 13 provides that the Bill shall also apply in the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel, and clause 14 contains the short title and provides that the Bill shall come into operation on a date fixed by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<p>This Bill is primarily aimed at providing the inhabitants of South-West Africa with a service, a service which will be of great benefit and advantage to them. Consequently I trust that both sides of this House will give this measure their full support.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>If we were convinced that this Bill was being directed at rendering a service to the inhabitants of South-West Africa, we would have supported it. However, we are far from being convinced that that is in fact what this Bill does. The Minister has indicated that we have now dealt with the establishment of a register and that the register of people permanently resident in South-West Africa will be kept in the Republic. In his presentation of this Bill he suggested that it was mainly complementary to the provisions of the measure which we have only just read a Third Time.</p>

<p>But with respect I want to say that that is not so. There are, in fact, some material differences between this Bill and the provisions of the Bill just dealt with. This measure, in conjunction with the measure just passed, clarifies at least one aspect of the law in regard to race classification, and that is that as a result of the repeal of section 22 of the South African Act of 1950 it can no longer be made operative in South-West Africa. So one looks at this Bill before us now as being a separate entity from the application of the 1950 Population Registration Act to South-West Africa except for the specific purposes of the register. I accept that I am correct in saying that that is the only application that Act will have.</p>

<p>Let us now have a look at this measure. First of all I should like to refer to a matter about which we have had considerable discussion under the Bill we have just passed, i.e. the question of the identity number. The Minister will remember that it has been clearly stated what the identity number for residents of the Republic shall contain and what shall be encoded therein. Why, then, is there in this Bill an entirely different approach to the compilation of the identity number? Whereas in the other Bill it is clearly stated what shall be encoded in that number, this Bill in clause 3 (2) provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The identity number shall be compiled in the prescribed manner out of figures and shall, in addition to a serial number and a control number, consist of a reproduction, in figure codes, of the prescribed particulars, and no other particulars whatsoever, of the person to whom it has been assigned.</block>

<p>What are the prescribed particulars? This Bill is silent as to what those particulars are. I want to go further. I have searched for this, but the manner in which those particulars shall be prescribed is left out of this Bill entirely. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can help me in this regard. I find no power under clause 10 for regulations to prescribe the particulars that shall be encoded in this identity number. We are now giving a blanket authority to prescribe what shall be encoded into an identity number. We know that as far as the Republic is concerned, one aspect is our race classification. There is no race classification as such in South-West Africa. There is, however, a classification which applies to the electoral laws of the country. This classification for electoral purposes is done on a different basis and according to the laws of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>A further point on which we need some clarification and which is certainly not clear either from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech or from the Bill itself, is in regard to the compilation also of the identity documents. Here we have the permissive authority regarding what may be included. I do not intend to repeat certain arguments put forward in regard to the other measure of this nature. I trust the hon. the Minister will regard them as having been included in any remarks made in regard to this Bill as to why we are opposed to the nature of the identity document. We have dealt with those, but here <span class="col_709-710" refersTo="page_0369"/>again there is a permissive provision as to what should be included.</p>

<p>I should like to put forward another objection in regard to this Bill, and in doing so I should like to refer to clause 2 (4), which reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">An identity document issued in terms of the Population Registration Act, 1950 (Act No. 30 of 1950), to any person, shall, so long as such person is permanently resident in the territory, be deemed to have been issued to him in terms of this section.</block>

<p>In other words, a South African or a person permanently resident in the Republic, is classified and issued with a South African identification card, on which the race classification is included. He must carry that card with him. It is deemed to be a document issued in terms of the identity documents for South-West Africa legislation. I believe that is undesirable. If race classification is not to apply in South-West Africa, a person who assumes permanent residence in South-West Africa should be entitled to receive a new identification document as a South-West African resident. He should not necessarily have to carry with him the document issued to him in the Republic.</p>

<p>I should like to come to another aspect to which we have objection, as we had in the other Bill. That is our objection to the obligation of notification of change of address. I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that the provisions of this Bill go far wider than the provisions of the Population Registration Amendment Bill. In terms of this Bill the landlord or host in the Republic is obliged to report to the Registrar in South Africa any person who comes there and who has not notified his change of address himself. I wonder why the hon. the Minister has found it necessary to include clause 7 (5), which reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The provisions of this section and any amendment thereof shall also apply in the Republic.</block>

<p>In other words, every landlord in the Republic is now answerable not only for his fellow republican citizens who are permanently resident here, but also for every South-West African who might come and take up residence in his property in the Republic. It seems to me a further onerous obligation which will be very difficult to enforce. I trust the hon. the Minister will not expect us on this side of the House to support this provision.</p>

<p>There are the other objections which are consistent with our objections to the first Bill. We are not prepared to support a measure which allows the Government to govern by regulation to the extent that this Bill does. Regulations will prescribe the composition of the identity numbers, regulations will prescribe what shall go into an identity document within the orbit of this vast number, regulations will prescribe the application of this Act and when it will be enforceable and regulations will say whether the whole of the population of South-West Africa or only portion thereof is to be subject to this Bill. In addition we believe that this document which is contemplated is clumsy, bulky, unnecessary and should not be applied to the citizens of South-West Africa who should be entitled to a handy, useful and simple form of identification. For those reasons we will oppose this measure and not support the Second Reading thereof.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with this Bill before the House we have reached an important milestone in the history of South-West Africa. I am very pleased that the Opposition is adopting this standpoint to-day, i.e. that they are not disputing this legislation. The hon. member for Green Point has in fact raised certain objections to certain clauses. This we can thrash out properly in the Committee Stage. South-West Africa is in many respects of course different from the Republic of South Africa. There is for example the question of an address. In South-West Africa we still have a large Bushman population, a nomadic nation which is here to-day and gone to-morrow. It will therefore not be possible to deal in all respects as precisely with the population of South-West Africa as with that of the Republic of South Africa. But there is another reason as well why I am glad that the Opposition is not disputing this legislation in principle to-day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<p>Where do you get that from; were you listening?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Are you opposed to it in principle? If hon. members are opposed in principle to that Bill, then I want to say that they do not have the right to be opposed to it in principle. Who represents them in South-West Africa? On behalf of whom are hon. members speaking? Do you know that the hon. Opposition does not have one single seat in South-West Africa? Do you know that the hon. Party which is now sitting opposite does not have one single person in South-West Africa who is an officially enrolled member of that Party. Not one single person! Now we know that the basis of democracy is that one should at least speak on behalf of those whom one represents. For that reason, if I were the Opposition, I would have said nothing about this Bill.</p>

<p>At one stage the hon. member for Bezuidenhout represented the Namib constituency here. That was many years ago. But he has at least been in South-West Africa. But I do not know whether the hon. member for North Rand has ever partaken of South-West African shepherd&#x2019;s tree coffee. I do not know whether he has ever been there. I really do think that the hon. Opposition should in this respect proceed from the assumption that they <span class="col_711-712" refersTo="page_0370"/>do not represent anyone in South-West Africa, and that consequently they are not competent to speak on behalf of one single person in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>This is an important milestone of South-West Africa, because it is a fact that every civilized country in the world to-day has some form of identity document or other. For various reasons South-West Africa has been lagging behind for a long time, and the population of South-West Africa has been waiting for this legislation, which we are ultimately getting now, for many years. We have a particular problem in South-West Africa. If we think of the general political situation in Africa to-day, we find that the northern states of Africa there is political turmoil to-day and that inhabitants of those states are streaming in their tens and hundreds of thousands to the southern part of Africa where there is economic and political stability. But now we find that there is no control in South-West Africa. We do not know who are foreigners. Any person can enter the Territory at any time, and we will simply not know who he is. One would simply not be able to distinguish him from someone else, because he simply moves in there. Our borders are not being guarded, and he is simply there. We know that during the past three years 18 <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat</i> have taken place in African States. Political chaos is prevailing there. Those people are being suppressed and that is why they come south to a country where there is peace and where there is political quiet and economic stability. For this reason we should already have made provision, a long time ago, for the population of South-West Africa to be given these identity documents in some way or other so that we would at least know who belongs in South-West Africa and who is a foreigner in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>There are other reasons as well why these identity documents for which provision is being made in this legislation, is going to be very useful to us. In recent years South-West Africa has grown tremendously. During the past eight years the population of Windhoek has increased twofold. Previously it was the case that everybody knew each other in South-West Africa, but to-day it is no longer so. When one arrives in Windhoek or one of the larger cities to-day, one sees that everybody is strange, for developments have taken place which we owe to this Government. There has been economic development of which we are proud. I want to invite the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to come along and see what South-West Africa looks like since he represented the Namib. For this reason this legislation offers an essential service which is being rendered. It happens so often that people of standing arrive at a place, and when they go to a bank or anywhere else for that matter, they are told: &#x201C;We do not know you; prove that you are So-and-so&#x201D;, and then they are unable to do so. One then has to scratch around and produce a radio licence or a driver&#x2019;s licence, or something of that kind, to try to prove that you are So-and-so, and then you can still see that they accept it reluctantly. Now we too at last have the privilege of receiving a document which one can produce immediately and say: &#x201C;This is my proof that I am So-and-so.&#x201D; That is why this is a useful service which is being introduced here.</p>

<p>There is another reason as well. We in South-West Africa travel frequently. I could arrive in the constituency of the hon. member for Pinelands, who is smiling so broadly now, and be asked: "Where is your proof that you are So-and-so&#x201D;. Then I would say: &#x201C;In South-West Africa we do not have identity documents&#x201D;. Then those people become suspicious. They think that it is merely someone from Pinelands who wants to hide his documents. That is why we welcome this legislation.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into details, because we will be able to thrash the details out in the Committee Stage, but there are other provisions in the Bill as well. There are other particulars, for example the question of an immunization certificate, which can be included in it. For example, immunization against poliomyelitis can be mentioned. Then there is also the blood group which can be indicated, if the person so desires. I think that it is very necessary, and I want to recommend it to every South-West African. In South-West Africa we have to cover tremendous distances. Sometimes one must drive 200 kilometers to the nearest town. That is why it is so necessary that one should have some certificate or other to indicate what one is allergic to. That is why the documents for which provision is being made in this legislation are so useful to the person who will be the proud owner. But these documents can also be utilized very beneficially for the future development of South-West Africa. That is why I want to say that on behalf of South-West Africa we welcomed this legislation. We welcome it wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland referred to me in a friendly fashion as the ex-member for Namib. Let me tell him that it is for me a matter of pride that of the members who came to Parliament from South-West Africa in 1950, I am the only one left. Therefore I do not mind in the least if he refers to me in that vein. The hon. member used a particularly strange argument. It struck me as odd that a man who used to be a Whip and who now occupies a higher position in this House, could adopt the attitude that we should not discuss a matter if it concerns a territory where we have no representation. But directly after that he proceeded to talk about the whole of Africa.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we are not speaking on behalf of South-West Africa. <span class="col_713-714" refersTo="page_0371"/>We have a task, as co-administrators of this country, to investigate every measure in the interests of all our people. His argument is therefore one which we must reject immediately. Likewise, he must admit that the Opposition, even though it is not the U.P. as such, has obtained thousands of votes in South-West Africa. Even on that basis it can therefore be said that the Opposition has a right to discuss this matter. However, I do not want to argue about on whose behalf we are speaking. We are speaking in the best interests of the whole of South Africa, and of South-West Africa as well. That is how we judge a matter. If we believed that a matter was in the interests of South-West Africa, we would support the measure, but if we think that it is not in their interests, we cannot support it.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that people here in the Republic who notice that a South-West African does not have an identity card, are usually suspicious. I think the hon. member is wrong. They are really envious of the South Africans for still having that freedom, and of still being free of the bother of having a population card of this nature. In the days when I was an inhabitant of South-West Africa there was one thing which I always appreciated, and that was that South-West Africa enjoys certain measures of freedom which people in the Republic did not have. This gave the Territory a character of its own, and as a result of that it was a very pleasant territory to live in. There was a minimum of classification of society. Figuratively speaking one could say that one was still able to live there by bread alone, whereas here one has to live by bread as well as permits. With all the administrative integration which has taken place in South-West Africa in the past few years, things have changed, and one can perhaps understand how a measure such as this has now become inevitable. In the light of the delicate position in which the Territory finds itself internationally, it was very sensible of the hon. the Minister to introduce a separate Bill for South-West Africa. We appreciate his not having introduced a Bill linking South-West Africa to the system of the Republic, with its race classification. It even struck me that there was a difference between the Bill which the hon. the Minister issued a few months ago for general information, and this Bill which is at present before the House. If I am correct, clause 10 of the original Bill granted the State President the right to make regulations to change the form, the constitution and the content of the identity document. The word &#x201C;content&#x201D; has been removed from this Bill. It is just as well, because we would definitely have objected to it. In the previous debate we raised objections to the form which the document will take in the Republic. Because it is fundamentally the same, the same objections apply to the South-West document as well. We do not want to reiterate this again; we have thrashed the matter out well and that is why I just want to confirm here the arguments which the hon. member for Green Point has just set out.</p>

<p>In addition, the hon. the Minister did not give us an indication that any of the population groups in South-West Africa had been consulted in regard to the introduction of this measure. I think that in the case of South-West Africa this was perhaps more necessary than in the Republic. I therefore have no indication whatsoever that this arrangement is acceptable to the people of South-West Africa. The officials whom the hon. the Minister made available, to the Opposition as well, and I want to mention the names of Mr. Fourie and the Secretary Mr. Du Preez in particular, kept us informed on this matter. We were afforded the opportunity of asking questions and I should like to have it on record that the officials kept us informed with great efficiency and patience. But the hon. the Minister should at least realize that we cannot discuss matters of political policy with the officials. That is why the party had to determine its attitude on this matter on its own. I can however say to the hon. the Minister that no blame for the fact that the Opposition opposes this matter attaches to the officials who discussed it with us.</p>

<p>Although this Bill is separate from the race classification system we have in the Republic, there are in the identity document for South-West Africa nevertheless elements of population grouping. This the hon. the Minister did tell us. He said in his speech that the Government had decided not to make the classification system as it exists in the Republic applicable to South-West Africa. It is a pity the hon. the Minister did not tell us why. I should, in a subsequent speech of his. very much like to hear what the real reason is, or what the decisive factor was in making the Government decide to introduce a separate Bill for South-West Africa and not to link it to the classification of the Republic. I shall inform hon. members why I am putting this question. The significance I read into that is that if the existing system is not necessary for South-West Africa we shall subsequently have to hear from the hon. the Minister why it is in any way necessary for the Republic. After all, circumstances in the two territories are not so different. The hon. the Minister will have to accept that we regard the fact that he introduced a separate Bill for South-West Africa, an aspect which we welcome, as justification for the standpoints which we have been adopting against the system in the Republic over the years.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said in his speech that the population group will be indicated in the number, but that it will be done by way of regulation. I hope I understood him correctly. If I understood the hon. the Minister correctly, he stated specifically in reply to a question by the hon. member for Green Point that the population group in South-West Africa will be indicated by the number. The hon. the Minister said that they <span class="col_715-716" refersTo="page_0372"/>will accept the indication given by the person himself. I should just like to ask the hon. the Minister what would happen if a person were to refuse to indicate under what group he fell, or what would happen if he were uncertain. Would there be any obligation on a person to indicate his population group if he did not want to do so? I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister would furnish us with a reply to that, because we would like to know what procedure would be adopted in the central register to determine the correct code if the group is not indicated by the person himself. I would also be grateful if the hon. the Minister could tell us how many population groups there will be and what the various categories will be. We hope that if this system works better in South-West Africa than the one in the Republic it will be one occasion where the Republic has learnt something of value from South-West Africa which it is hoped could subsequently be applied here.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in reply to the hon. member for Green Point I just want to say that we will prescribe this identity number as indicated to us by the South-West African Administration. That also serves as a reply to the last question asked by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. In South-West Africa there is an almost unique method of population classification. It is done administratively. If any doubts or objections are raised, the Administrator and a number of officials or Executive Committee members form a committee which decide on such matters. We will take over these particulars which South-West Africa supply us with. It is not going to be our function, seen from the point of view of population registration, to classify people there. I shall return in a moment to the question of classification, but I first want to reply in full to the questions of the hon. member for Green Point. The way in which identity numbers will be prescribed, is laid down in clause 3 (2) of the Bill, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The identity numbers shall be compiled in the prescribed manner out of figures and shall, in addition to a serial number and a control number, consist of a reproduction, in figure codes, of the prescribed particulars, and no other particulars whatsoever, of the person to whom it has been assigned.</block>

<p>When I reply to the questions of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, I shall inform hon. members how the classification of population groups according to those numbers will be done. The phrase &#x201C;the prescribed way&#x201D; in the subsection means by way of regulation. In my introductory speech I said that those regulations would be laid upon the Table here so that hon. members would be afforded ample opportunity to criticize, accept or reject them. The House still has the last say on the way in which this regulation can be implemented. The hon. member also raised the question of a person who comes from South-West Africa and becomes subject here in the Republic to the provisions of clause 7 (5), i.e. the compulsory notification of change of address. If a person is no longer residing in South-West Africa, but has taken up permanent residence in the Republic, surely he must become subject to the laws of this country. He will then be subject to the provisions in terms of compulsory notification of change of address and I fear that in his case there can be no exception. The hon. member for Green Point again voiced a general objection to notification of change of address. I think we thrashed this matter out properly yesterday, and that it is inevitable. Without compulsory notification of change of address we simply cannot cause this population register to function satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout wants to know whether the different population groups in South-West Africa were consulted. I can inform the hon. member that the Administration of South-West Africa welcomes this measure. People there do not have identity cards, and that is why this measure is being welcomed. As far as South-West Africa is concerned, the Administration of South-West Africa is surely the responsible mouthpiece in this regard. The hon. member has now raised the question of classification. Firstly, this is not a classification measure; I said this in both my introductory speeches. This is a population registration measure which introduces an identity document system and we are simply taking over the classification, or in the case of South-West Africa, their population index. Whether or not it is desirable to have race classification in South-West Africa is a matter which could most probably be thrashed out on another occasion. Then the hon. member can simply use that as a peg on which to hang his attacks on our present classification system. But it is really not the occasion to-day to deal with this here.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me a question in regard to the identity number and the persons who will be identified. I should be glad to furnish these particulars now. It is the intention, apart from the Native nations, to have the White, Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama population groups in the Territory designated by their respective identity numbers. The eleventh and twelfth figures of the number will indicate whether the person is a South African citizen and also to which population group he belongs. For the rest the number, as in the Republic, will be based on the person&#x2019;s date of birth, citizenship and sex. For example the number of a male person who was born on 10th December, 1940, is a South African citizen and a member of the Rehoboth population group, will be the following: 401210/5001/07/1. The figures are interpreted as follows: &#x201C;40&#x201D; is the year of birth, &#x201C;12&#x201D; is the month and &#x201C;10&#x201D; the day of birth. The &#x201C;5001&#x201D; indicates the male sex. I told hon. members yesterday that a number above 5000 means &#x201C;male&#x201D; and <span class="col_717-718" refersTo="page_0373"/>below 5000 &#x201C;female&#x201D;. The &#x201C;07&#x201D; indicates the population group to which I referred here. The &#x201C;0&#x201D; indicates that he is a South African citizen. The Rehoboth population groups is then indicated by the figure &#x201C;7&#x201D;. The &#x201C;1&#x201D; at the end is the control number which is necessary in order to establish that the particulars are correct. That covers the questions which were raised.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members know, the administration of justice is a matter with regard to which the administration of the affairs of the Territory of South-West Africa is carried on, in terms of the provisions of the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969, (Act No. 25 of 1969), by the Minister of Justice. The Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act, 1944, is not applicable to the Territory and lower courts in the territory are established and function in terms of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Ordinance, 1963 (Ordinance No. 29 of 1963), of the Territory. With a view to uniformity and greater efficiency it is desirable to apply the legislation of the Republic in this connection to the Territory. This is being done by the Bill which is before this House now. The relevant clauses in this regard, are certain definitions in clause 1, and clauses 4, 6, 10, 20, 21 and 22.</p>

<p>Certain other amendments of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act are, however, also necessary and I shall presently deal with them.</p>

<p>The clauses regarding applicability are self-explanatory and actually require no clarification. However, I may just mention certain aspects. The amendment in clause 4 will have the effect that a magistrate who is transferred from the Republic to South-West Africa, or <i>vice versa,</i> will have to take the oath of office only once instead of twice as the legal position is at present. A similar amendment also appears in the Supreme Court Amendment Bill, 1970, as far as Judges are concerned. The amendment contained in clause 6 is an adjustment which is being made as a corresponding provision does not appear in the legislation of the Territory. The proposed subsections (2) and (3) of the proposed section 115A&#x2014;clause 21&#x2014;are necessary because of certain references to the Criminal Procedure Act and the fact that our Interpretation Act is not applicable to the Territory.</p>

<p>As far as the clauses other than the clauses regarding applicability in the Territory are concerned, Sir, I mention in passing that the other amendments contained in clause 1 are of a purely technical nature.</p>

<p>As far as the amendment in paragraph (h), at present paragraph (e), in clause 2 is concerned, I want to mention that several so-called <span class="col_719-720" refersTo="page_0374"/>detached magistrates&#x2019; courts already exist at places which have been designated by the Minister of Justice in terms of that paragraph for the holding of courts for certain districts. Although the offices serve areas which are at present not statutorily defined, administrative limits have nevertheless been prescribed and the work which originate within those limits, is dealt with by the detached offices. Heavy expenditure is incurred in connection with the establishment of the offices with a view to serving communities more conveniently locally. This arrangement is, however, being hampered in one respect, i.e. by the fact that parties in civil actions cannot be obliged to institute proceedings at detached magistrates&#x2019; courts. The magistrate&#x2019;s court of the district retains rival jurisdiction throughout. In practice the result is that plaintiffs in cases still institute proceedings in the main court of the district. In view of judicial staff, buildings and facilities which have to be made available at the detached offices in each case, the efficient handling of judicial work in this connection in the districts concerned is being restricted.</p>

<p>It appears that problems which are being experienced can be overcome, without disturbing the existing set up of districts and detached offices, by determining areas of jurisdiction for detached offices which, for all purposes, will still form part of the district concerned, but which will be regarded as separate entities for the purposes of jurisdiction of the courts concerned. That is being done by paragraph (h) of clause 2 and clause 9 of the Bill.</p>

<p>As far as clause 5 is concerned, section 9<i>bis</i> (2) of the Act provides how the Regional Divisions Appointments Advisory Board is to be constituted. That provision was inserted when there was only one Deputy Secretary of Justice. At present there is more than one officer holding this rank, and consequently it is not necessary any longer to appoint undersecretaries to the Board. In paragraphs (b) and (d) in this clause provision is therefore being made for the new situation. The provision in paragraph (c) in that clause, (that the head of the Training Section of the Department of Justice will also be a member of the Board) is necessary because that officer is directly concerned in the practical training given to regional magistrates. In paragraph (d) of clause 5, as in the case of chief magistrates and deputy secretaries, it is being provided that someone holding the rank instead of the office of Attorney-General may be appointed as a member of the Board.</p>

<p>The amendments in clauses 7 and 8 are being effected as the court rules under the old 1917 Act have ceased to exist a long time ago.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 12 gives effect to the court&#x2019;s decision in <i>Woudstra</i> v. <i>Jekison,</i> 1968 (1) 453 (T), whereby the word &#x201C;payment&#x201D; was given a wide meaning.</p>

<p>The amendments in clauses 14 and 15 arise from an amendment to the magistrate&#x2019;s court rules whereby the civil record book was abolished.</p>

<p>No provision exists in the Act for the disposal of goods attached by the messenger of the court, of which the owner cannot be traced after the attachment has been withdrawn. In view of the fact that the Act and the court rules make provision for a judicial sale only, it is necessary for provision to be made for this situation as well. It appears to be more appropriate to do this by way of amending the Act itself rather than the court rules. This matter is being regulated by clause 16.</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of section 93<i>bis</i> of the Act, a judicial official is required, if it appears that the trial may more properly be conducted before the court of a regional division, or that the imposition of certain sentences would have been competent if the accused had been convicted by the court of a regional division, or when the prosecutor so requests, to stop the trial or to set aside his finding and refer the case to the court of a regional division. In terms of section 186 (4) of the Criminal Procedure Act a judicial officer other than the one who convicted the accused, may impose a sentence in the absence of the latter. Section 93<i>bis</i> does not make provision for such cases, with the result that a judicial officer who acts in the absence of another, is not bound by that. In order to eliminate this anomaly, a suitable amendment is being effected by clause 18.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 19 is being effected so as to enable the courts to impose more realistic sentences in connection with offences relating to the execution of judgments.</p>

<p>With that, Sir, I think I have clarified the main aspects.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Official Opposition has no objection to this Bill being read a Second Time. It is generally an amending Bill. If it has any particular principle, then that principle is probably to make the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act of 1944 applicable to South-West Africa in view of the changes, particularly administratively, which this House deemed necessary recently to bring about in respect of South-West Africa. It is, therefore, appropriate that also the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act of 1944 now be made applicable to that Territory.</p>

<p>For the rest, as I have said, this Bill is more of an amending Bill and as such more of a Committee Stage Bill. It may be that when we come to that stage we on this side of the House may have something to say in regard to some of its provisions. At this stage, however, we have no objection to its Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Although the Bill appears to be long, it actually contains only one fundamental principle i.e. the application thereof to the Territory of South-West Africa. As hon. members know, the administration of the affairs of the Territory of South-West Africa with regard to estates of deceased persons is one of the matters which, in terms of section 19 of the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969, rests with the Minister of Justice.</p>

<p>In the Territory the estates of deceased persons are at present still administered according to the provisions of the Administration of Estates Act, 1913, as applied to the Territory by the Better Administration of Justice Proclamation, 1921 (Proclamation No. 52 of 1921), of the Territory of South-West Africa. It is desirable that uniform legislation in connection with the administration of estates should apply in the Republic and the Territory, as was the case before the Administration of Estates Act of 1965 came into operation in the Republic.</p>

<p>The various clauses of the Bill are self-explanatory and contain the necessary adjustments for making the Act applicable in the Territory. However, I just want to mention a few aspects which may possibly not be clear from the Bill itself. The amendment in clause 5 is being effected because the Trust Moneys Protection Act, 1934, is not applicable in the Territory. As far as clause 10 is concerned, the Act will not be applicable to the estates of persons who are members of the Rehoboth community. The estates of those persons are administered in terms of Proclamation No. 36 of 1941 of the Territory.</p>

<p>It will be noted in the Schedule that the whole of the Administration of Estates Act, 1913, as applied to the Territory, is being repealed, except in so far as section 115bis of that Act is concerned. A corresponding provision does not appear in the Administration of Estates Act, 1965, but does appear in section 24 of the General Law Amendment Act, 1952 (Act No. 32 of 1952), of the Republic. This section reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever according to the terms of the will of a testator who dies after the date of commencement of this Act, a pre-deceased child of that testator would have become entitled to any benefit under that will if he had survived the testator, the lawful descendants of that child shall be entitled <i>per stirpes</i> to that benefit unless the terms of the will indicate a contrary intention.</block>

<p>When the Administration of Estates Act which applies to the Territory is repealed, it is therefore essential to retain section 115<i>bis</i> until such time as the provisions of section 24 of the General Law Amendment Act of 1952 are applied to the Territory.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill is similar in effect to the previous Bill, in that it makes the Administration of Estates Act of 1965 applicable to South-West Africa. What I said earlier in regard to the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Amendment Bill applies equally to this measure. The Official Opposition has no objection to the Second Reading of this Bill either.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The provisions of this Bill actually speak for themselves and consequently I need not say much about them. As hon. members know, the administration of justice, including matters relating to commissioners of oaths, is included among the matters in regard to which the administration of the affairs of the Territory of South-West Africa is dealt with by a Minister of the Republic in terms of the provisions of the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969. In the case of the administration of justice the Minister concerned is of course the Minister of Justice. The appointment, powers and duties of commissioners of oaths in the Territory of South-West Africa are still regulated under the Commissioners of Oaths Proclamation, 1928. In this regard I may just mention that that proclamation makes no provision for the appointment of justices of the peace. In terms of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance of the Territory only commissioned police officers are justices of the peace for the purposes of that ordinance.</p>

<p>In the Bill now before the House provision is made for the amendment of the Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Oaths Act, 1963, so as to apply that Act to the Territory of South-West Africa. This is being done because it is the objective, for purposes of uniformity and greater efficiency, to apply the various Acts relating to the administration of justice, of which this Act is only one, to the Territory. Although the Commissioners of Oaths Proclamation of 1928 of the Territory makes no provision for the appointment of justices of the peace, the application of the Republic legislation in the Territory in this <span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0376"/>connection will place persons holding offices in the Territory, as mentioned in the first schedule to the Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Oaths Act, on an equal basis with their counterparts in the Republic. In addition, it will be possible that, as in the Republic, justices of the peace will be able to render valuable services in connection with the administration of justice, especially in remote areas in the Territory.</p>

<p>Clauses 1 and 2 contain the key provisions of the Bill. The first schedule to the Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Oaths Act, 1963, contains a list of offices the holders of which are justices of the peace <i>ex officio.</i> In that list the offices of, <i>inter alia,</i> Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner, Bantu Affairs Commissioner, etc., are mentioned. Legislation applicable in South-West Africa, however, makes no provision for such offices, but does make provision for those of Chief Native Commissioner, Assistant Chief Native Commissioner, etc. Consequently it is necessary to make an adjustment in this connection, and this is being done in clause 3 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the repeal of the existing laws of the Territory and contains transitional provisions.</p>

<p>Clause 5 provides for the commencement of the amending Act on a date to be fixed by proclamation, in order to afford an opportunity for the adjustment of notices and regulations issued in terms of the Act of the Republic.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, <b>I</b> move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The various clauses in the Bill have been fully explained in a memorandum which has been tabled. I therefore do not consider it necessary to explain each clause in detail again, and I shall therefore only clarify certain aspects further. In the first place, there is the proposed changes in respect of the Bantu Affairs Commission as embodied in clauses 1, 4 and 5. The hon. the Minister and I myself want to involve the Commission more actively in respect of those general matters entrusted to it in terms of subsection (1) of section 3 of the Bantu Affairs Act, 1959, i.e. the consideration of any matter concerning the general management of the administration of Bantu affairs and the submission of recommendations in that connection, apart from, of course, the specific matters which the commission must consider or on which recommendations must be made in terms of some or other statutory provision, for example subsection (2) of section 9 of the Bantu Education Act, 1953, which requires the commission first to institute an inquiry before the registration of a school may be withdrawn.</p>

<p>The fact that the Commission functions under the chairmanship of the Minister concerned &#x2014;even if only technically, as there is a deputy chairman&#x2014;is, after all, not altogether reconcilable with the idea of a body which must advise the Minister independently of that Minister. Therefore I propose that the Minister should no longer be the chairman, as does the Minister himself. As a result of the rearrangement of relationships with South-West Africa it was agreed that the Administrator of South-West Africa would no longer be a member of the Commission, although the Commission&#x2019;s duties will also include the native peoples in that Territory.</p>

<p>I should also like to mention further considerations concerning the Commission. The activities of the Department cover a very wide field and include many different and specialized matters, in respect of which members of the Commission could hardly be expected to have specialized knowledge, while it is, of course, unpractical to alter the composition of the Commission in such a way that there are at least one or perhaps two members who have special knowledge of such matters. Therefore it is necessary that the Commission should have the right to call in the assistance of experts when circumstances require it, and provision is now being made here for that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as a result of the diversity of activities it is unpractical for the full Commission to meet in order to consider the details of various specialized matters coming before it. For this reason it is necessary to provide that it may act by way of committees which can undertake preliminary investigations and research and even call in experts to serve on the committees, after which a report is made to the full Commission. It is, of course, standard practice in many institutions to act in this way by means of committees. The appointment or designation of persons who are not members of the Commission, to assist it or to serve on committees of the Commission, and the appointment of the committees, will then be regulated in terms of the proposals in clause <span class="col_725-726" refersTo="page_0377"/>5, by way of regulations. I also just want to point out to hon. members that the persons who, as I have explained, will assist the Commission or serve on the committees, will, of course, not be members of the Commission and will therefore only be compensated for their services and expenses which they must of necessity incur in connection with these services.</p>

<p>The second aspect I want to mention concerns the provision in regard to the representatives of self-governing territories and territorial authorities, as well as the representatives of chiefs in urban Bantu councils. We want to place the representatives of the Bantu homeland authorities in the White areas on a better footing. From negotiations with the various authorities and the experience already gained, it is clear that proper representation can only take place if one person is primarily responsible to the homeland authority and if he is then assisted by assistants and councils determined according to the needs and the number of members of the relevant national unit in any particular area. The representatives will have to play a continually increasing role in looking after the interests of their compatriots in respect of the homeland authorities, and there should therefore be close liaison with these compatriots, which can best be achieved on the basis proposed in clauses 2 and 3. This will also create a more efficient channel for members of a national unit in a White area to link up with the homeland authority, and for this reason it is now also desirable to review the position of the representatives of chiefs on urban Bantu councils, as explained in the memorandum.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support this Bill, not because it necessarily supports our policy in all its provisions, but because it does so in one important aspect and is further proof of the Government&#x2019;s blunderings and of its embarrassment for not heeding United Party advice from time to time. With regard to the first clause I want to say that we do not object to the proposed amendment to the effect that the Bantu Affairs Commission will not have to be consulted in certain issues. We do not object to this because we fear that this Bantu Affairs Commission is merely becoming a rubber stamp. Gone are the old days when the members of this commission were appointed solely for their knowledge of Bantu affairs, Bantu life, Bantu habits and customs. There is obviously no object in consulting with the Bantu Affairs Commission anymore. Therefore, we do not blame the hon. the Minister for wanting to amend the Act so as to absolve him from that obligation. He cannot entrust this commission with certain work. I think that is all to the good. The less he gives this commission to do, the better. We would like to see a strong commission, as it was. We fear that with the commission as it is now, we see no reason to object to the Minister depriving it of certain of its authority. Clause 2 limits the members of chiefs representatives and clause 3 is consequential. We are opposed to the appointments of these ambassadors, as we call them. We also opposed this in the original Act. However, we do not object to this amendment which the hon. the Minister now envisages if it will mean better administration. As I say, this does not fit in with our system. If the Government feels it is necessary to make this amendment, we will not stop them. Clauses 4 and 5 reconstitute the Bantu Affairs Commission. Again we do not object. I wonder whether the Minister could tell us why it is not considered advisable to specify in this Bill that one of the members of the commission shall be appointed to represent the interests of South-West Africa? The Administrator of South-West Africa used to be an ex-officio member of the commission. However, that provision has been deleted and there is an additional member being appointed. There may be some reason why this Bill does not provide especially for representation from South-West Africa. I would be glad if the Minister would deal with that in his reply.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the members of the urban councils, those dealt with in clauses 8, 9 and 10. Hon. members will remember that we were opposed to the selection of members of those councils. I want to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister for proposing this amendment. I want to congratulate him and his department that they have not waited for 20 or 40 years as some departments have done before taking over the policy of the United Party. They have only waited nine years in this instance. The hon. the Deputy Minister was not a Deputy Minister when the original Act was passed and I do not know whether he was even in the House then. It is just as well for the hon. the Minister that he is not here to-day, because on that occasion he spoke as the Deputy Minister. It will be remembered by the House that we supported the Urban Bantu Councils Act, or Bill as it was then, for one reason and that is because it carried out principles of our policy in giving the urban Bantu a council for which they could elect members themselves. There were selected councillors and elected councillors on this body, and we were opposed to the selection of councillors. The selected councillors were, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said just now, representatives of the chiefs. The Minister is now proposing to delete this provision for selected councillors. When the present Minister, who was then Deputy Minister, refused to accept an amendment at the time &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to say why we are supporting this Bill. Surely, I am entitled to motivate my reasons. I want to ask the Minister to consider whether he should in fact proceed with this Bill in its present form? We will support it, but is it wise from the Government&#x2019;s point <span class="col_727-728" refersTo="page_0378"/>of view? That is what I want to ask. When the present Minister was a Deputy Minister he said the following when he refused to accept an amendment to delete the selected members from the Bill and I quote from his Hansard in 1961 (column 9152):</p>

<block name="quote">It would mean that we thereby destroy the link between these councils in the urban residential areas and the Bantu homelands, and the basis of their national unity in the homelands. That would be the direct result if this amendment were to be accepted. That, of course, is of fundamental importance because we on the Government side, and in terms of our policy of separate development, or apartheid if you would like to call it that, see the Bantu in the urban areas as directly linked up with the Bantu in the homelands, and the national units as they are organized there. But we cannot allow anything which would sever this link with the Bantu homelands or with the national units.</block>

<p>I am merely pointing out that this seems to be contrary to the Government&#x2019;s policy and in accordance with the United Party policy. If the Government is in fact changing its policy, I would be glad if the hon. the Minister could tell us about it. For these reasons, I shall support this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is probably a very long time since we last had a Bill in connection with Bantu affairs in this House which went through unopposed. We are very grateful that this is so on this occasion. It affords me very great pleasure that this is so.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked why we did not make provision for the representation of the Territory of South-West Africa on this commission. The reply is that the commission as a whole is being granted those powers in respect of the Native population in South-West Africa. It is therefore not necessary to retain that representation. In the second place, it has never been the principle to appoint the representatives on the Bantu Affairs Commission on a regional basis. That is therefore the reply to that, and I think the hon. member accepts that it is quite correct to do what we are now doing here.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that we had taken over the United Party&#x2019;s policy in respect of the urban Bantu councils as well as in respect of the removal of the chiefs&#x2019; representatives as selected members on the urban Bantu councils. This is, of course, not true at all. What is true, and I hope the hon. the Opposition will take proper note of what I am going to say now, is that the policy of multi-national development has made such good progress and has been implemented so brilliantly under the National Party regime that we can now establish a much better form here, i.e. a properly representative council of the people, which can function alongside the urban Bantu councils in the white area. Previously, when the Minister did, in fact, say what the hon. member read out to us, it was necessary to retain the liaison with the Bantu people by means of the chiefs&#x2019; representative as a selected member on the urban Bantu council. If there has ever been an example of the progress made by the National Party&#x2019;s policy, and not of a take-over of United Party policy, hon. members have it here in this Bill, with reference to the words the hon. member quoted.</p>

<p>We do not want to make politics out of this, but the hon. member is now supporting the excellent progress that has been made in connection with the policy of multi-national development. Lastly, I want to say that I am only a young member here and therefore cannot speak of 1936 and the years before that. However, I do not think I am wrong in saying that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development has never in its history had a better Bantu Affairs Commission than at the present moment. The Bantu Affairs Commission is anything but a rubber stamp; on the contrary, let me tell the House that the Bantu Affairs Commission is doing key work in this country, and I want to express my appreciation to the members of the Bantu Affairs Commission for that.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that this Bill, and I am glad the hon. the Opposition is supporting it, is creating the necessary machinery to make this Bantu Affairs Commission a very important instrument in the still more rapid implementation of the policy of multinational development. I particularly want to emphasize that the system of committees which will now be introduced by regulation, will in future make it possible to make use of the services of experts, particularly economists and agriculturists, as well as others for the purposes of the Bantu Affairs Commission, particularly for the rapid implementation of economic development and for the assistance which can be rendered in that way for the development of the Bantu homelands. If there is any semblance of truth in the allegation that the Bantu Affairs Commission is merely a rubber stamp, we are moving away from that to a position where the Bantu Affairs Commission is becoming a very strong instrument in the implementation of the policy of multi-national development.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>During the 1969 session the measure before the House was referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and recommendation, and all persons concerned in the matter were afforded every opportunity of giving evidence. According to the report presented by the Select Committee, there was a division in regard to certain fundamental aspects of the Bill as read a First Time. An amended Bill, retaining those fundamental matters on which there was a difference of opinion, was reported. I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Chairman and members of the Select Committee for the thorough manner in which they acquitted themselves of their task.</p>

<p>During the recess the President-in-Chief and office bearers of the Central Council of the Institute of South African Architects approached me with a view to ascertaining whether I would be prepared to allow further talks to be held with the Department of Public Works in regard to the Architects&#x2019; Bill, as reported by the Select Committee. I intimated my willingness accordingly, subject to the condition that no amendments of a fundamental nature would be considered, i.e.&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) appointments to the Council shall be made by the Minister on the basis of nominations submitted by the architects&#x2019; institutes;</li>

<li>(ii) no architects&#x2019; institute or institutes shall be entrenched to the exclusion of others;</li>

<li>(iii) no existing provincial institute shall be recognized as an architects&#x2019; institute;</li>

<li>(iv) regulations shall be made by the Minister and not by the proposed council; and</li>

<li>(v) all actions which have the force of law, shall vest in the Minister.</li>

</ol>

<p>These principles were accepted by the representatives of the Institute, and in the course of a series of meetings, consultations were held and agreement was reached on a number of amendments which do not encroach upon the said principles. On the strength of this the Institute indicated in writing that The Bill before the House at the moment had its full support.</p>

<p>I think it would be interesting to give a survey of this profession over the years. For about 42 years the architects&#x2019; and quantity surveyors&#x2019; professions have been regulated by the Architects and Quantity Surveyors (Private) Act, 1927 (Act No. 18 of 1927), and the regulations made under this Act. Under that Act full powers in regard to registration, the determination of registration and annual fees as well as professional fees, disciplinary measures, training, etc., shall vest in the hands of the Institute of South African Architects and the Chapter of Quantity Surveyors, with the Central Council of the Institute as the over-all controlling body.</p>

<p>As from 1st April, 1967, the Minister of Public Works has been entrusted with the duties of the Minister in terms of this Act. Just after the administration of the Act had been taken over, it became obvious to the Department of Public Works that the legislation had not kept pace with the tremendous change that had taken place in the building trade and the profession since the commencement of the Act. The Act in itself is not only outmoded, inadequate and in many respects archaic, but there are also doubts about the validity of several regulations. In fact, the legal advisers confirmed that one of the most important regulations, i.e. the one on training, is <i>ultra vires</i> the Act. Apart from specific aspects or principles of the Act to which there are objections, its philosophy, seen as a whole, is basically wrong in this respect, i.e. that it invests the Institute, whose primary function is the promotion of the interests of the architects&#x2019; profession and its study and science, with all the powers which are normally vested in statutory bodies such as those for medical men, accountants and engineers who, apart from ordering the affairs of the profession itself, have to look after the interests of the public.</p>

<p>During the first half of 1967 the Central Council of the Institute of S.A. Architects put forward certain proposals for the amendment of the Act. However, these contributions were not to make nay contribution whatever to giving the Act any semblance of being modern or of rectifying its inadequancy. If the Institutes proposals were adopted, certain considerations would also have come to the fore in regard to the procedure to be followed in handling a measure seeking to amend a private Act. Talks were held with the interested parties, and they also argued that the existing Act did not invest the Institute of S.A. Architects and the Chapter of Quantity Surveyors with adequate powers for protecting themselves and their members. In the meantime the quantity surveyors&#x2019; profession, which had by this time reached full matiruty, had also started knocking loudly on the door, asking for their independence.</p>

<p>In the light of all these considerations the Department of Public Works drafted legislation which contemplates the substitution of the existing Act and is aimed at settling the whole position in the interests of the effective protection of and control over both professions. For reasons with which I shall deal briefly <span class="col_731-732" refersTo="page_0380"/>when a similar measure, the legislation relating to quantity surveyors, will be presented to this House in a moment, it was obvious that the time for a parting of the ways had arrived for the professions concerned.</p>

<p>Separate draft bills were accordingly prepared. Both bills were drafted on the lines of the Professional Engineers Act (Act No. 81 of 1968), which has proved to be an unqualified success so far. After talks had been held with the interested parties on the principles contained in these measures and after I had also had an interview with a deputation from the Institute of S.A. Architects on a certain occasion, these measures were advertised in the <i>Government Gazette</i> for general information prior to being introduced in this House.</p>

<p>The Bill was not acceptable to the Institute, and its standpoint throughout was that the present Act, except for those amendments it had proposed, was functioning quite satisfactorily as far as the Institute was concerned. As regard some of the principles that were to be incorporated in the new measure, the Institute waived fundamental differences of minor importance, and took a firm stand on two aspects on which I was not prepared to give way, i.e. the proposed entrenchment of the provincial institutes in the draft bill and, secondly, the proposal that the making of regulations be left in the hands of the council that was to be established. The entrenchment of the provincial institutes has extensive implications, such as the fragmentation of the profession and the limitation of the possibilities of statutory recognition being gained later on by additional architects&#x2019; associations which may be established. Furthermore, it would create an incongruous position in that in the absence of a co-ordinating body, a statutory body, i.e. the S.A. Council of Architects, would in effect be invested with powers for controlling these provincial institutes, which will have corporative status. As regards the making of regulations by a person or body other than the Minister, the principle in regard to the authority of Parliament and its right to call the Minister concerned to account, is so clear that I am not going to say any more about it.</p>

<p>However, as I have already stated, these differences were settled during the recess, and the Bill which is before the House at the moment has the support of the organized architects&#x2019; profession.</p>

<p>Next I come to the principles contained in the Act. and I shall start by dealing with the constitution of the council. The Bill before the House seeks to establish a S.A. Council for Architects, which will be a statutory, independent body similar to those of other professions where controlling bodies were established by way of appropriate legislation. The council will consist of 17 members to be appointed by the Minister. Twelve of them will represent the profession and will be nominated by the existing architects&#x2019; institutes or the architects&#x2019; institute or institutes to be established. Two members will represent those universities in the Republic where tuition is offered in architecture. From the ranks of the architects in the service of the State the Minister will select one person for appointment to the council, whereas provision is also being made for the nomination of two additional members by virtue of their knowledge of public affairs and the economic requirements of the country; one of these members is to be selected by reason of his knowledge of the law as it relates to the practice of architecture.</p>

<p>As the educational aspect and standards of training are of cardinal importance, an Education Advisory committee is being established as well. The Minister will appoint the members of this committee, as he does in the case of the council. The committee will be constituted of a representative of each university which has a faculty of architecture, and these persons are to he professors or lecturers in architecture and are to be nominated by the various senates. Two persons are to be nominated by my colleague the Minister of National Education. There will, in addition, be appointed to the committee a number of members, nominated by the architects&#x2019; institutes, equal in number to the difference in number between those nominated by the universities and those nominated by my colleague.</p>

<p>Apart from the customary provision for regulating its own domestic affairs, the council will also be expected to advise the Minister on&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the making of regulations for giving effect to the Act, regulations in which, <i>inter alia,</i> the examination recognized for the purposes of registration as an architect, will be prescribed;</li>

<li>(b) the requirements with which an association of architects is to comply in order to qualify for recognition;</li>

<li>(c) the minimum fees which are to be chargeable by an architect for his professional services; and</li>

<li>(d) the kinds of work that are to be performed by architects alone.</li>

</ol>

<p>What is of importance to the profession, is that the exceptionally important registration function will be carried out by the council. The council will also have to keep a watchful eye on the architects&#x2019; profession, and for this purpose it will be invested with the necessary powers for taking disciplinary steps in cases of improper conduct on the part of architects. Similarly, provision is also being made for the council to take any such steps as it may consider expedient for the protection of the public in their transactions with members of this profession.</p>

<p>The income of the council will for the most part be derived from registration and annual fees. However, it is being provided that, <span class="col_733-734" refersTo="page_0381"/>should this be necessitated by the functions of the council, moneys may be advanced to the council from public funds, in consultation with the Minister of Finance. The council will control its own funds. Furthermore, the council will annually submit to me a report on its activities and finances, copies of which will be laid upon the Table of this House.</p>

<p>Registration as an architect will be subject to the requirements that the applicant&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) shall not be less than 21 years of age and shall ordinarily be resident in the Republic;</li>

<li>(b) shall have passed the prescribed examination or any examination recognized by the council;</li>

<li>(c) shall for a period of at least three years have performed work of a prescribed kind under the supervision and control of an architect, or architectural work of sufficient variety and of a satisfactory nature;</li>

<li>(d) shall, subject to certain exemptions, be a member of an architects&#x2019; institute; and</li>

<li>(e) shall not be subject to certain disqualifications, such as improper conduct, previous offences, being of unsound mind, insolvency, etc.</li>

</ol>

<p>Any person who immediately prior to the commencement of this measure was registered as an architect in terms of the existing Act as well as the Ordinance which applies in South-West Africa shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements for registration. However, applications in this regard must be made within six months after the commencement of the Act or within such period as the council may allow in a specific case.</p>

<p>In order to encourage qualified persons living beyond our borders to come to this country and to make provision for those who may settle here on a temporary basis so as to undertake major projects, provision is being made for temporary registration for periods which may not exceed 12 months and which may be extended.</p>

<p>Strong pleas were made to the Select Committee for the protection of the established rights of those persons who, although they are not in possession of the prescribed academic qualifications and have therefore not been able to register as architects under Act No. 18 of 1927, have over the years gained so much practical experience in architectural work that they are making a decent living out of it. In fact, in the ranks of the architects themselves the admission was made that such persons were making a valuable contribution and were, in certain respects, rendering an indispensable service in the building trade. Accordingly the Select Committee inserted a new section 19 (5) (b), which provides as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Any person who&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) is not less than 50 years of age and is ordinarily resident in the Republic; and</li>

<li>(b) at the date of commencement of this Act, was engaged in the performance of work of an architectural nature which in the opinion of the council is of sufficient variety and of a satisfactory nature and standard, and had been so engaged during a period of not less than 25 years prior to that date; and</li>

<li>(c) satisfies the council that he has an adequate knowledge of the legal principles which, in the opinion of the council, are fundamental to the profession of architecture and an adequate knowledge of the application of such principles,</li>

</ol>

<p>shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements laid down in regard to prescribed or recognized qualifications.</p>

<p>To ensure that architects who recently completed their studies, gain the necessary practical experience to round off their training properly, the Bill lays down that they are to register as architects in training. For a period to be determined by regulation they will have to work under the control and supervision of an architect before they can be registered as such. Therefore, full registration as an architect is based on the philosophy that such a person has not only been trained properly in the theory of his profession, but also that he is well-equipped as regards the practical side of his work.</p>

<p>The Bill contains a prohibition against any person who has not been registered as an architect and who pretends to be one or performs for gain any kind of work reserved for architects, except in cases where specific exemption has been granted under the Act or the regulations. Penal sanctions are being laid down for offences of this nature.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Bill seeks to make regulations as to matters such as the allowances payable to members, keeping a register of architects, prescriptions in regard to improper conduct and the procedure to be followed in inquiries, as well as rules of conduct for the profession. Irreproachability in the conduct of an architect is a prerequisite for the proper development of this profession. Preserving the integrity and enhancing the status and prestige of architects as a professional group, will therefore be basic to these rules of conduct.</p>

<p>As regards existing architects&#x2019; institutes: In recognition of the significant contribution which the Institute of South African architects has made under the existing Act in the development of the architects&#x2019; profession and architecture as such, this Bill provides that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_735-736" refersTo="page_0382"/>(a) at the commencement of the measure now under discussion, that institute shall be deemed to be a recognized architects&#x2019; institute, provided that it shall within three years comply with any requirements prescribed by regulation;</li>

<li>(b) it shall be a body corporate, a provision which will as a matter of fact be applicable to every association of architects which receives statutory recognition; and</li>

<li>(c) the existing provincial institutes, which are constituent bodies of the Institute of S.A. Architects, shall be corporate as long as they so remain constituent bodies, but that no such provincial institute shall be recognized as an association of architects.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then there is the repeal of laws. The repeal of the Architects and Quantity Surveyors (Private) Act, 1927 (Act No. 18 of 1927) and the Architects Ordinance, 1952 (No. 38 of 1952) (South-West Africa) is being envisaged, subject to certain provisos.</p>

<p>The establishment of a S.A. Council for Architects will definitely be an important step forward in the interests of the proper ordering of the profession, the protection of both the architect and his client and the enhancement of the status of architects, as well as the improvement of their standards of training. All these things must necessarily benefit the country as a whole. Moreover, they should undoubtedly be instrumental in making the profession as such more attractive and in attracting more and more young men to this profession.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this measure is an important one for the South African architects. It establishes a new council for the architects and makes provision for incidental matters arising from that. I think it is a happy position to-day that the hon. the Minister has been able to announce to this House that the architects are now happy with this measure and look forward to working under this Act for the improvement of their profession and in the public interest. I say this because there was, at the stage when the Select Committee completed its deliberations, quite a lot of concern in the minds of architects over certain aspects. It is gratifying&#x2014;and I am sure that the architects themselves are gratified&#x2014;that the hon. the Minister and the Department were prepared to continue discussions after the Select Committee had made its recommendations, which discussions, as I said a moment ago, were concluded to the satisfaction of all parties.</p>

<p>I do not wish to say much in regard to the principles of this Bill. They have been dealt with in detail by the hon. the Minister and I have nothing to add to what he has said.</p>

<p>There is one matter of principle, however, which at the second reading stage of the debate I should like to deal with, and that is a matter of principle on which the Select Committee was unable to find a solution, despite very considerable discussion and despite the investigation of a number of possible alternatives. I refer here to the position of architectural draughtsmen.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister will be aware of the second report of the Select Committee which, on this aspect was a unanimous report. Certain other aspects of the decision of the Select Committee were not unanimous, but in respect of this second report this decision was unanimous, and it was brought about in this form simply because, as I said a moment ago, the Select Committee found it impossible to make provision for the draughtsmen who at present carry out certain architectural work but are not qualified in terms of the Act to continue to do it. The Institute of Draughtsmen made representations before the Select Committee and asked that first of all they should be excluded from the provisions of this Bill. They asked that draughtsmen, particularly members of the S.A. Institute of Draughtsmen, and the work performed by them should be specifically excluded from the restrictive provisions of this Bill as well as the following Bill on the Order Paper dealing with quantity surveyors. The unanimous decision of the Select Committee was that this request could not be acceded to because to a large extent, if it were acceded to, it would defeat some of the main objects of this Bill, which were to constitute architects and the architectural profession under one body, to protect these persons within an institute and at the same time to protect the public. It would have been impossible to achieve these objects, particularly the protection of the public, if they were excluded entirely from the provisions of this Bill, because otherwise they would not have been subject to any form of control whatsoever as they are not at present governed under any particular statute. The Committee considered some ways in which they could be protected and to some extent the work they are doing, recognized. The architects themselves conceded that in the main the work which architectural draughtsmen do is very valuable and in particular&#x2014;I think this is the important aspect of the matter&#x2014;the architects stated that it would not be possible for them to carry out all the work now being done by draughtsmen, even if they were required to do so by the Act. But at the same time they felt that some form of control had to be exercised over these persons. But I emphasize that it was not the attitude of the architects that they should take over all this work. They said specifically that they would not be able to handle it. It was thought that it might be possible to afford them some protection by placing an upper limit on the value of the work they would be allowed to perform and the suggestion was canvassed that that limit <span class="col_737-738" refersTo="page_0383"/>should be R20,000. The idea was that within that limit they would then be able to do any form of architectural work they were presently doing. However, the draughtsmen themselves were not in favour of the suggestion. In all the circumstances it would be undesirable to introduce a provision of this sort because the evidence before the Select Committee was to the effect that much of the work to-day being done by draughtsmen exceeded R20,000 in value. For example, we had evidence that some of these draughtsmen were employed by oil companies to do the design of and drawings for alterations to filling stations and in some cases even to do the drawings for new filling stations. That was thought to be perfectly in order because this was not complicated work and draughtsmen were competent to do it. The value of this type of work was stated to be between R40,000 and R50,000. If, therefore, we had agreed on a limit of R20,000, this work would have been excluded for them. Alternatively it was suggested that some provision should be made to specify the work draughtsmen ought to be allowed to do. This suggestion, too, gave the Select Committee problems and after considering the matter came to the conclusion that it was not possible to accede to this either. In a supplementary memorandum the draughtsmen stated that they ought to be allowed to do the following (vide p. 52. S.C. 6&#x2014; 1969) &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That draughtsmen, particularly those in private practice for their own account, should in future not be prevented from undertaking the design, preparation and execution of plans and allied services, specifications and bills of quantities for the following categories of buildings as generally defined in town planning schemes:</block>

<td><p>R60.000</p></td>

<p>These values were to be the upper limit and were to be subject to periodic examination and reappraisal. But the Select Committee decided that it could not accede to this either. Amongst other reasons, there was the fact that the representatives of the &#x2026;</p>

<p>I shall not be much longer over this, Mr. Speaker. The reason why I have to go into some details is that this is a matter which exercised much of the Select Committee&#x2019;s attention. It is appropriate to deal with it here as matter of principle arising as it does from clause 7 (3) (c) of the Bill requiring the Minister &#x201C;to &#x2026; prescribe the kinds of work in connection with projects and undertakings or services of an architectural nature which shall be reserved for architects&#x201D;. It was in the light of this that the draughtsmen were worried that they could be deprived of a means of livelihood if the work allocated to architects made it impossible for draughtsmen to carry on.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not go into more detail than is necessary to explain to the House the problem involved and to make a suggestion to the hon. the Minister. The problem in connection with accepting the alternative suggestion of the draughtsmen was twofold. In evidence (See p. 45&#x2014;S.C. 6&#x2014;&#x2019;69) the draughtsmen themselves conceded that many of their own members were probably not qualified to initiate buildings such as blocks of flats of R60.000 to R100,000 from beginning to end. Furthermore, the estimate was that there were about 20,000 draughtsmen practising in South Africa to-day and that only 500 of these were members of the Institute of Draughtsmen. The bulk of them therefore, i.e. 19,500, were neither members of the Institute of Draughtsmen, nor subject to any form of control whatsoever. Consequently some form of control is necessary. At the same time, however, the Select Committee felt that some provision should be made so that these draughtsmen were not deprived of their livelihood because, as I have already pointed out, the evidence was that they performed a valuable service, a service which the architects, through shortage of numbers, would be unable to take over. Hence, the Select Committee in its Second Report recommended that in applying clause 7 (3) (c) &#x201C;the position of persons presently practising as draughtsmen must be taken into account, and care taken to ensure that such persons are not deprived of their livelihood as a result of the new legislation, provided that the interests and safety of the public are accorded priority&#x201D;. When he replies to the debate, or when we deal with clause 7 (3) (c) in the Committee Stage, I should like the hon. the Minister to indicate whether or not he is prepared to accept this recommendation of the Select Committee and whether he is prepared to go one step further. When he has before him the recommendations of the architects in regard to the types of work they like to be preserved for them, would he then consult the draughtsmen before finally promulgating the necessary regulations? If he is prepared to do that, it would allay much of the fears of the draughtsmen. The Minister would therefore be rendering a service to this profession if he makes that clear in this debate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Select Committee had great difficulty in framing a provision which could be included in the Bill and itself felt that this could better be achieved administratively. Therefore I agree with the hon. the Minister; only he should state in this House that he accepts that recommendation of the Select Committee and that he will act accordingly.</p>

<p>Then there is the broader aspect of this which was also referred to by the Select Committee in its Second Report. This concerns the whole future of draughtsmen. The Select Committee had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore it became evident during the hearing of evidence that steps should be taken to regulate the draughtsmen&#x2019;s profession and to establish the necessary facilities for the proper training of draughtsmen, particularly architectural draughtsmen.</block>

<p>I do suggest that this is a real need and I would suggest that some measure should be introduced in the future which would bring the 20,0 odd draughtsmen under some form of institute. It would probably be unwise to place them under a separate institute. This is subject to debate, but it is my personal view that it would possibly be better if they were recognized officially as a wing, as it were, of the architectural profession. In other words, they should be brought in under this Bill which is before the House by amendments at a later stage, when the matter has been properly investigated. This can, however, only be done when proper official diploma courses have been established at technical colleges so that persons who wish to practise as draughtsmen in future can be trained, can obtain a diploma and can be properly recognized.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The question of fees is important when dealing with the draughtsmen. It was an important point they raised in justifying their existence. In many cases they are able to charge lower fees to the public than architects. This point was conceded by the architects. The fact that the draughtsmen in many cases perform a vital service, was not disputed.</p>

<p>Sir, other than these remarks, I believe that the Bill which is before the House to-day, is a good measure, one which will ensure that the architects&#x2019; profession can develop in the future, both in the interests of the architects themselves and in the interests of the country as a whole. Bearing in mind the tremendous developments which are envisaged in South Africa in the immediate future and in the next few decades, it is important that a profession which is so vital to the whole development of South Africa, such as the architects&#x2019; profession is, should be placed on a proper footing, as is being done in this Bill. Therefore we on this side of the House are happy to support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Select Committee on this matter, I want to express, in the first place, my gratitude and appreciation to members of both sides of the House for the support I received from them in the course of our deliberations. I also wish to express my gratitude to the officials of the Department of Public Works. If ever a Select Committee has proved its worth, then it was done by this Select Committee. When this proposed legislation was read a first time and when it was submitted to the Institute of Architects, they rejected the legislation <i>in toto.</i> But after deliberation and lengthy negotiation, we are very grateful to be able to say that we have a Bill to-day which is being unanimously accepted by both sides of the House. In this regard the officials of the Department of Public Works deserve a great deal of the praise and the credit.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave mentioned the question of the draughtsmen. This is a matter which received our attention. It is also a matter which should in the future receive the attention of the Minister in particular. What the hon. member for Musgrave said, is true. It is by no means my intention to detract from the splendid work done by our architects, but to-day the draughtsman is the person who does the donkey work. If we were to remove the draughtsman, we would cause our building costs to soar sky-high. With a view to this period of tremendous prosperity which we are experiencing in the building trade, we should like to see that no restraints are imposed on the draughtsmen, who are doing very valuable work to-day. We found it very difficult to decide on a specific amount as to what the value of the building had to be. It is not possible for us to-day to lay down that they may not handle works of which the value is in excess of a figure of R100,000. I would be the last person to say that a draughtsman may not construct something which costs a R100,000. If one took sheds for instance, the hon. member for Virginia, who is one of the directors of the co-operative societies, would really take us to task, for very large sheds are being built to-day. They do not necessarily want architects for this purpose. All they really need, is a draughtsman.</p>

<p>However, we want to ask the hon. the Minister that when the regulations are drafted, there should be thorough consultation with the Institute of South African Architects and, furthermore, that the interests of the draughtsmen should be looked after properly. I want to conclude by reading out a letter I received from the President of the Institute of South African Architects. The letter reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_741-742" refersTo="page_0385"/>I wish to write a personal note to you as I thought you should know that both professions have now accepted the proposed Bill in an amended form. Negotiations took place with the Department from June immediately after the publication of the Select Committee Report until December when such agreement was reached. The members of the architectural profession concerned feel that the deliberations of your Committee played a large part in the success of the negotiations and the quantity surveyors have fallen into line with the suggested amendments, all of which will facilitate the application of legislation and the effectiveness of the profession within the new framework. I would be pleased if you could convey to the members of your Committee the appreciation of both professions for this result.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this once again shows us the value of a Select Committee when deliberations are taking place on a very high level. We hope and trust that this procedure will always be followed.</p>

I should like to associate myself with the hon. member for Brakpan in the gratitude he conveyed to the members of my Department for the tactful and dedicated manner in which they had set to work in order to get this measure accepted at last. Furthermore, I want to express my gratitude to the hon. member for Brakpan who as chairman did his work brilliantly, with a great deal of patience and dedication. I want to give him the assurance that, if any difficulties should crop up in the implementation of this Act, I would definitely consult with him and the other members of the Select Committee. As regards the position of the draughtsmen, I can give the hon. member for Musgrave and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout the assurance &#x2026; [Laughter.] It would seem to me as though <b>I</b> have but a poor opinion of the hon. member. <b>I</b> mean the hon. member for Brakpan, of course. I can give those two hon. members the assurance that the interests of the draughtsmen will be taken care of.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I wish to thank the hon. member for Musgrave, as the senior Opposition member who served on this Select Committee, for the way in which he assisted the Committee. I know that at the beginning there were very grave differences. As a matter of fact, shortly after I was appointed Minister of Community Development we started with this legislation and I thought at that time that I was going to get into a very severe war with the architects and the quantity surveyors. It is not that I dislike wars, but I like to fight wars with people I do not like so much as I like architects. I want to thank the hon. member and I want to assure him that as far as draughtsmen are concerned, I will bear in mind the recommendation of the Select Committee. I think this will work itself out in practice. It may be necessary eventually to come with amendments to certain of these clauses. I can assure the hon. member that I will most certainly pay attention thereto and that I will see that nothing is done that may act against the draughtsmen in the profession. The hon. member thanked me for coming to an agreement upon a Bill in respect of which there initially were very great differences. I think he is now convinced what a good and reasonable Minister I am.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time. <i>Introduction</i></block>

<p>Those persons who have an interest in this measure, have been afforded every opportunity of submitting written and/or oral evidence to the Select Committee during the 1969 Session. According to the report presented by the Select Committee, there was a division in regard to certain fundamental aspects of the Bill as read a first time. An amended Bill, retaining those fundamental matters on which there was difference of opinion, was reported Now that the Select Committee has performed its duties, I should like to express my gratitude, as I did a moment ago, to its chairman and its members for the competence and thoroughness they displayed.</p>

<p>During the recess the President and office-bearers of the Chapter of Quantity Surveyors approached the Secretary for Public Works with a view to ascertaining whether the Department would be prepared to have further talks in order that differences might, as far as possible, be settled within the framework of the Bill reported by the Select Committee. I attached my approval to that, and subsequently these topics were discussed. An agreed measure was arrived at without the principle of the Bill being affected. The latter deals especially with the following&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) appointments to the council shall be made by the Minister on the basis of nominations submitted by the quantity surveyors&#x2019; associations;</li>

<li><span class="col_743-744" refersTo="page_0386"/>(ii) no quantity surveyors&#x2019; association shall be entrenched to the exclusion of others;</li>

<li>(iii) regulations shall be made by the Minister and not by the proposed council;</li>

<li>(iv) all actions having the force of law, shall be vested in the Minister.</li>

</ol>

<p>These principles were adopted by the representatives of the Chapter of Quantity Surveyors, and in the course of a series of meetings, consultations were held and agreement was reached on a number of amendments which do not encroach upon the said principles. On the strength of this the Chapter indicated in writing that the Bill before the House at the moment had its full support.</p>

<p><i>Survey</i></p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the Second Reading of the Architects&#x2019; Bill, which has already been dealt with and agreed to by this House, I gave a short historic survey of the whole matter and also indicated the considerations that had given rise to the preparation of new legislation in substitution for the existing Act, i.e. the Architects and Quantity Surveyors (Private) Act, 1927 (Act No. 18 of 1927). As this House has been furnished with the relevant information in this regard, I do not consider it necessary to dwell on this matter again and to take up the time of this House in doing so. However, on the previous occasion I referred briefly to the quantity surveyors&#x2019; profession, mentioning that in dealing with this measure I would elaborate further on this matter in so far as it affected the members of this profession.</p>

<p>To start with I must mention that, after it had become obvious that the time for new legislation was ripe, a provisional draft Bill for the architects was drafted with the object that it would serve as a subject for discussion between the Department of Public Works and the Institute of South African Architects. In the course of the first discussions on this matter, a member of the quantity surveyors&#x2019; profession wanted to know whether the time was not opportune for that profession to be granted full control over its own weal and woe. This was followed up by the Chapter of Quantity Surveyors which, during February, 1968, sent to the Department a deputation under the leadership of its then president with the request that a separate draft Bill for the quantity surveyors&#x2019; profession be drafted. This request was readily acceded to. for there was on the part of the Department full sympathy with this profession in its endeavour to attain independence.</p>

<p>Since the commencement of the Act in 1927, this profession, which has about 600 members at present, has indeed undergone a metamorphosis. However, the fact of the matter is that the Central Council of the Institute of S.A. Architects is constituted in such a manner that the architects have an overwhelming majority on it and were given conclusive control over the quantity surveyors and their profession. By rights nobody can blame this profession, which reached mature status a long time ago, for aspiring after having exclusive control over its own fortunes. For that reason it has been decided that the State should at once assist the quantity surveyors&#x2019; profession in every way in their endeavour to attain independence. I am pleased to be able to testify that since then it has been possible to count on the assistance and co-operation of the quantity surveyors at all times. As a result it has been possible to dispose of the preparatory work in regard to the drafting of legislation in the shortest possible time. As I have already stated, any differences that existed were settled during the recess, and this Bill has the support of the organized quantity surveyors&#x2019; profession.</p>

<p><i>Principles of the Act</i></p>

<p>(1) <i>Constitution of the Council:</i> The Bill before the House seeks to establish a South African Council for Quantity Surveyors, which will be a statutory, independent body, similar to those of other professions in respect of which controlling bodies have already been established by way of appropriate legislation. The council will consist of 17 members to be appointed by the Minister. Twelve of them will represent the profession and will be nominated by the various quantity surveyors&#x2019; associations on such a basis as the Minister will determine with due regard to the membership. Two members will represent those universities in the Republic at which tuition in quantity surveying is being offered. From the ranks of the quantity surveyors in the service in the State, the Minister will select one person for appointment to the council, whereas provision is also being made for the nomination of two additional members by virtue of their knowledge of public affairs and the economic requirements of the country; one of whom is to be selected by reason of his knowledge of the law as it relates to the practice of quantity surveying.</p>

<p>As the educational aspect and the standards of training are of cardinal importance, an Education Advisory Committee is to be stablished. The Minister will appoint the members of this committee, as he does in the case of the council. The committee will consist of a representative of each university offering tuition and examinations in quantity surveying, and these persons are to be professors or lecturers in quantity surveying, and are to be nominated by the respective senates of the respective universities. Two persons are to be nominated by my colleague the Minister of National Education. There will, in addition, be appointed to the committee a number of members, nominated by the quantity surveyors&#x2019; associations equal in number to the difference in number between the persons nominated by the universities and those nominated by the Minister of Education.</p>

<p><span class="col_745-746" refersTo="page_0387"/>(2) <i>Powers:</i> Apart from the customary provisions for regulating its domestic affairs, the council will also be expected to advise the Minister on the following matters&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the making of regulations for giving effect to the Act, regulations in which, <i>inter alia,</i> the examination recognized for the purposes of registration as a quantity surveyor will be prescribed;</li>

<li>(b) the requirements with which an association of quantity surveyors is to comply in order to qualify for recognition;</li>

<li>(c) the minimum fees which are to be chargeable by an architect for his professional services; and</li>

<li>(d) the kinds of work that are to be performed by architects alone.</li>

</ol>

<p>What is of importance to the profession, is that the exceptionally important registration function will be carried out by the council. The council will have to keep a watchful eye on the quantity surveyors&#x2019; profession, and for this purpose it will be invested with the necessary powers for taking disciplinary steps in cases of improper conduct on the part of quantity surveyors. Similarly, provision is also being made for the council to take any such steps as it may consider expedient for the protection of the public in their transactions with members of this profession.</p>

<p><i>Funds</i></p>

<p>The income of the council will for the most part be derived from registration and annual fees. However, it is being provided that, should this be necessitated by the functions of the council, moneys may be advanced to the council from public funds, in consultation with the Minister of Finance. The council will control its own funds. Furthermore, the council will annually submit to the Minister a report on its activities and finances, copies of which will be laid upon the Table of this House at regular intervals.</p>

<p><i>Registration</i></p>

<p>Registration as a quantity surveyor will be subject to the requirements that the applicant&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) shall not be less than 21 years of age and shall ordinarily be resident in the Republic;</li>

<li>(b) shall have passed the prescribed examination or any examination recognized by the council;</li>

<li>(c) shall for a period of at least three years have performed work of a prescribed kind under the supervision or control of a quantity surveyor, or quantity surveying work of sufficient variety and of a satisfactory nature;</li>

<li>(d) shall, subject to certain exemptions, be a member of a quantity surveyors&#x2019; association; and</li>

<li>(e) shall not be subject to certain disqualifications, such as improper conduct, previous offences, being of unsound mind, insolvency, etc.</li>

</ol>

<p>Any person who immediately prior to the commencement of this measure was registered as a quantity surveyor under the existing Act as well as the Ordinance which applies in South-West Africa, shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements for registration. However, applications in this regard must be made within six months after the commencement of the Act or within such period as the council may allow in a specific case.</p>

<p>In order to encourage qualified persons living beyond our borders to come to this country and to make provision for those who may settle here on a temporary basis so as to undertake major projects, provision is being made for temporary registration for periods which may not exceed 12 months and which may be extended.</p>

<p>To ensure that quantity surveyors who recently completed their studies, gain the necessary practical experience to round off their training properly, the Bill lays down that they are to register as quantity surveyors in training. For a period of three years after graduation they are to work under the control and supervision of a quantity surveyor before they can be registered as such. Therefore, full registration as a quantity surveyor is based on the philosophy that the person concerned has not only been trained properly in the theory of his profession, but also that he is well-equipped as regards the practical side of his work.</p>

<p><i>Control</i></p>

<p>The Bill contains a prohibition against any person who has not been registered as a quantity surveyor and who pretends to be one or performs for gain any kind of work reserved for quantity surveyors, except in cases where specific exemption will be granted under the Act or the regulations. Penal functions are being laid down for offences of this nature.</p>

<p><i>Regulations</i></p>

<p>The Bill also seeks to make regulations as to matters such as the allowances payable to members, keeping a register of quantity surveyors, prescriptions in regard to improper conduct and the procedure to be followed in inquiries, as well as rules of conduct for the profession. Irreproachability in the conduct of an architect is a prerequisite for the proper development of this profession. Preserving the integrity and enhancing the status and prestige of quantity surveyors as a professional group, will therefore be basic to these rules of conduct.</p>

<p><span class="col_747-748" refersTo="page_0388"/><i>Existing Quantity Surveyors Associations</i></p>

<p>In recognition of the important role the Chapter of Quantity Surveyors has played in the development of the profession represented by it, this Bill provides that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) at the commencement of the measure under discussion, that Chapter, under the name of the Association of South African Quantity Surveyors, shall be deemed to be a recognized quantity surveyors&#x2019; association, provided that it shall within three years comply with any requirements prescribed by regulation; and</li>

<li>(b) it shall be a body corporate&#x2014;a provision which will as a matter of fact be applicable in respect of every association of quantity surveyors which receives statutory recognition.</li>

</ol>

<p><i>Repeal of Laws</i></p>

<p>The repeal of the Quantity Surveyors Ordinance, 1959, of South-West Africa is being envisaged. As regards the disposal of the assets, rights, liabilities and obligations which the Chapter of Quantity Surveyors shares with the Institute of S.A. Quantity Surveyors and with its provincial institutes, appropriate provision has been made in the other measure which has already served before this House.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this measure which creates the machinery whereby the quantity surveyors will come into full control of their own profession, is an important step forward. The advantages of this measure will not only permeate to the other building professions, but will definitely be of importance and significance to the country as a whole. In passing this measure we shall reach a milestone in the history of the building and construction industry in our country in the sense that now, for the first time, we shall have appropriate legislation for all the building professions, which, apart from the protection of their own and of public interests, will ensure and put beyond doubt their mature status as against one another.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill is similar to the previous one, the Architects&#x2019; Bill, and what I said about the Architects&#x2019; Bill applies equally to this one. I therefore do not intend to take up the time of the House by repeating what I have said. I merely want to ask the hon. the Minister once again in the interests of the draughtsmen who, to a lesser extent, could be affected by the work of quantity surveyors, to give a similar assurance to the one he gave in regard to the previous Bill which assurance will allay the fears of the quantity surveyors. Other than this, because of the fact that the quantity surveyors as a result of negotiations during the recess, are now happy with this Bill, we on this side of the House support the second reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The War Graves Act, 1967 (Act No. 34 of 1967, empowers the South African War Graves Board to repair, maintain and generally take care of certain graves and burial grounds. The Board is also empowered to erect memorials and to establish gardens of remembrance. In order to achieve these objects, the Board may purchase, take on lease, hire out or alienate immovable property and also purchase movable property, exhume and reinter remains of graves, and regularly inspect or cause to be inspected all graves and gardens of remembrance falling under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Certain problems are now being experienced in the execution of these functions which can be eliminated only by amending the War Graves Act suitably. In view of the fact that the Board may and does possess property, it is essential for the Board to be able to insure such property. In the execution of its powers and duties, it is also essential for the Board to be able to insure its members against claims which may arise as a result of accidents in which its members, its staff and employees may be involved. At the same time this will protect the State against losses, because the lion&#x2019;s share of the funds which the Board has at its disposal, comes from the State. In order to be able to carry out its duties in connection with the maintenance of graves, gardens of remembrance and memorials as well as the exhumation and reinterment of remains, it is obvious that the Board or its officials must have access to the land on which the graves, gardens of remembrance, etc., are situated. Most of these graves and memorials are on private property and, although certain servitudes are registered in favour of the State as regards the Cape Province, it is not the case as regards the other provinces. Therefore, if the Board is to execute its powers and duties properly, its right of access must be put beyond any doubt. Hindrance or obstruction in respect of this power is being included in the <span class="col_749-750" refersTo="page_0389"/>offences and penalties in terms of section 19 of the Act. But by the same token it is fair to give any person who owns land on which a direct ancestor is buried the right to refuse permission for the remains of such an ancestor to be exhumed and reinterred elsewhere. When such an owner will be given this irrefutable right, that will have to be on the distinct understanding that in that case the Board will not be responsible in any way for the further maintenance of the grave concerned.</p>

<p>Clause 2 (1) and (2) of the Bill amends the procedure which has to be followed in determining the travelling and subsistence allowances of members of the Board or a committee thereof. In the past the allowances were determined by regulation, and whenever the allowances were increased, the regulations had to be amended. The procedure which is now being proposed will eliminate a considerable amount of administrative work and is in agreement with the practice generally followed at present.</p>

<p>Clause 2 (3) contains a new principle, i.e. that the Board will have a remunerated chairman. A heavy burden rests on the shoulders of the chairman. He constantly has to undertake journeys in order to conduct negotiations and exercise supervision and always has to be available to give guidance to the staff. Consequently, it is considered advisable to remunerate him and provision is being made in the Bill for such remuneration to be determined by the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance. In view of the fact that the chairman commenced his activities on a full-time basis on 1st December, 1969, provision is being made to allow him to be remunerated as from that date.</p>

<p>Up to now the administrative work of the Board has been done by seconding officers of the Public Service for this purpose. The Board has requested the power to appoint and control its staff itself, and consequently provision is being made for this in the Bill. This is necessitated by the fact that the Board often has to enter into duty contracts and even has to buy individual services in order to be able to do its work. The rights and privileges of officers already in the service of the Board, are protected in terms of the Public Service Act. Provision is also being made so as to enable staff members to become members of the Associated Institutions Pension Fund.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, seeing that the content of the legislation before us was requested by the War Graves Board, with some of whose members we have had discussions, it gives us great pleasure to support this legislation. We are of the opinion that clause 1, which deals with the adequate insurance of the Board&#x2019;s property and the safety of its members while they are on duty, is completely justified.</p>

<p>Clause 2, which makes provision for proper allowances for the chairman and the members of the Board in the execution of their numerous duties, also meets with our approval. I just want to say that we on this side of this House have the greatest appreciation for the great historical task which these people are called upon to fulfil. We also agree with the provisions of clause 3, i.e. that the Board should have the power to appoint officers and employees as far as it is deemed necessary for their work. Seeing that many of the war graves with which the Board will have to deal, are situated on private property, it is only right that its members, when they act on the instructions of the Board, will be given exemption from any complaints of trespassing while they are engaged in the execution of their duties. It gives us pleasure to support this legislation.</p>

<p>This Bill, as is fitting, was introduced in a restful atmosphere and it is necessary that it be discussed in such an atmosphere. The Minister presented this case in great detail and very effectively. In the course of time, the South African War Graves Board, which was established in terms of Act No. 34 of 1967, has experienced various bottlenecks in the execution of its duties. It is, of course, very essential for this legislation to be supplemented whilst the principles already laid down are being retained.</p>

<p>Sir, there are a few aspects which are very important to me, and the first is that the powers of this Board are being extended in that the Board or its officials may now enter areas to which the Board had no access before. I remember very well that years ago, when this matter was not co-ordinated on a national basis and when similar legislation did not exist, certain people were not kindly disposed towards the bodies which undertook the task of restoring war graves, and refused them admission to the graves. Therefore we are very pleased that this provision is now being inserted by this Bill.</p>

<p>Another matter which is very important to me and about which I am very pleased, is that this Board may now appoint its own officials. In the past officials from other Departments were seconded to help this Board <span class="col_751-752" refersTo="page_0390"/>in its work, but the necessary continuity was lacking as a result of the fact that time after time it was a different official who had to do the specialized work. Therefore we are especially pleased that provision is now being made for the Board to appoint its own officials to do that work. Therefore we believe that this work which was undertaken with great success in the past, namely the location, the preservation, the tending and the maintenance of war graves, will be done even better than in the past.</p>

<p>Sir, the life insurance which is being given to officials and members of the Board in terms of this measure, is, of course, another very important step with which we all agree. What I found particularly striking, is the accommodating spirit which we find in one of these clauses, i.e. in respect of people who have conscientious or sentimental objections to the exhumation and reinterment of an ancestor. If there are such cases, such persons can be accommodated in terms of this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion I just want to say the following: By means of the general acceptance of this amending Bill, we on both sides of this House are indirectly paying grateful tribute to the memory of those who laid down their lives at the altar of sacrifice in the course of years. Sir, a people who honours its heroes and heroines will never be despised, and lastly, a people in whom the memory of its heroes and heroines continues to live, will always be able to lay claim to a continued existence.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with a feeling of humility that I rise to address you; humility which is based on the fact that this is my first speech in this House, and which flows from the fact that I am following in the footsteps of worthy predecessors who have set high standards here. I can only say that I hope and wish that I shall be able to uphold their standards.</p>

<p>With further reference to the hon. member for Wynberg, who said that we supported this Bill in principle, I just want to say that we are convinced that these amendments are essential for the efficient execution of the duties of the South African War Graves Board. As a statutory body this Board has been in existence for three years only, but it has for several years been actively concerned with the location, the maintenance and the preservation of war graves throughout the length and breadth of our country. As is known, it first existed as a permanent committee, and before it attained its present status, the position was that people who served on the Committee were representatives of other bodies, bodies which undertook the preservation of war graves merely as part of their activities. It operated mainly through the British Forces Committee as well as the Civil Graves Committee. These were the two executives through which it functioned.</p>

<p>Sir, this Board has become the conscience of the nation to a certain extent. Throughout the country we have established gardens of remembrance and memorials in which we all take pride and which we regard as our grateful tribute to our predecessors. I think the amendments which are being made, remind us once again of the fact that the Board is performing a task on our behalf, actually a duty which we have, in the first place, to the deceased person. This is a task which they perform out of honour and respect in the sense that we accept that here we have a man or a woman who, for whatever the reasons were, was prepared to fight and sacrifice for what they believed in. Ironical as this may sound, in most cases this was for the sake of a peaceful coexistence. Therefore we do not ask questions, and I can say that we as a nation are grateful that we have people who are prepared to perform this task on behalf of us all.</p>

<p>In the second place, I think, they are performing a duty on our behalf. War graves are part of our history a relic of the past, and for the historian who is trying to reconstruct the past&#x2014;a self-imposed task&#x2014;it is, of course, of the utmost importance. I think in the last place they are performing a duty on behalf of us all, and in this case it is a duty to our own descendants. If we can draw inspiration from and appreciate something which exists to-day, it is our duty to ensure its preservation for our descendants so that they may derive the same measure of appreciation and pleasure from it.</p>

<p>To come back to the amendments which are being proposed here, I want to mention only two which we particularly welcome. Firstly, we welcome the clause which makes provision for insurance coverage, insurance coverage in the first place in respect of the considerable amount of property which the South African War Graves Board has. Any damage to that property will, of course, be a setback to their own positive programme for expansion. I think it is only right that we should be eliminating this shortcoming to-day, three years after the original legislation. Secondly, it is only right that provision should be made here for insurance coverage in respect of an injury sustained by a person such as Dr. Kieser, for example, who is the chief archivist and at the same time chairman of this Board, in the execution of duties on behalf of the Board, because such duties fall outside the scope of the normal work expected from a chief archivist. Without this provision, such a person is not covered, and that, of course, is not right.</p>

<p>The last point I want to make concerns the exhumation and reinterment of mortal remains. We welcome the fact that the direct descendants will have the final say in this case, because we must accept that the feeling which a descendant has towards an ancestor, differs greatly from the feeling we as the public or as members of that Board have, no matter how sincere we may be. There is a difference, <span class="col_753-754" refersTo="page_0391"/>and we are pleased that provision is being made for that in this legislation.</p>

<p>But I want to make one request, and that is that people who are, in fact, in the position to exercise this final say, should think twice before they do so. Here I am thinking in particular of the tremendous task which awaits the Board, one in which they are engaged, i.e. the consolidation of the Magersfontein graves. Here one finds spread over an area of approximately 2,000 miles&#x2014;that is the distance from the one grave to the other&#x2014;from Warrenton in the north to Douglas in the south and from Griquatown in the west almost to Boshoff in the east&#x2014;burgher graves, graves which the Board is at present consolidating into a garden of remembrance at Magersfontein. I think it will be a pity if people are unreasonable and refuse permission for the exhumation and reinterment of the mortal remains of the burghers, because this is a matter of import to the nation as a whole, and we must preserve this heritage for the sake of posterity.</p>

<p>It is a great pleasure for me to welcome the hon. member for Durban (Central), and to congratulate him sincerely on his maiden speech which he has just made in this House. As he comes from the teaching profession, it is, of course, a pity that this Party deemed it fit to grasp him from that profession, but I do think that it is very essential for us to obtain people of his background and training in this House. He comes here with the necessary youth, with a very good training, and I am sure, as an ex-teacher, with the enthusiasm which is necessary for this new task which he has come to undertake here. I think his speech this afternoon proved how he feels about these matters, and I look forward to a pleasant period of co-operation with him as long as I may have this portfolio. I want to congratulate him very sincerely. I am especially pleased about the appeal he made to next of kin that they, in spite of their personal feelings about the mortal remains of their ancestors, should not refuse permission for exhumation and reinterment for that reason. Here the War Graves Board is engaged in something really noble and fine and we need everybody&#x2019;s co-operation, and I am very pleased that he in particular made that appeal to those people this afternoon, one I should like to confirm. I trust that the hon. member will be happy in this House and that he will make a valuable contribution. In fact, I do not doubt that.</p>

<p>I should also like to convey my thanks to the hon. member for Wynberg for supporting this Bill on behalf of her side of this House. I am very thankful for that support, and I think this is the way it should be as far as this Bill is concerned. I think it holds many beautiful promises for the future. If in future the shadow Minister on that side adopts the attitude which she adopted this afternoon and supports all legislation introduced by the Minister, I think we are entering a very pleasant era as far as this portfolio is concerned. I am pleased she supports it, because I believe that the War Graves Board really performs a very important task. I think both sides of this House will agree with me that the work which this Board is doing, is highly appreciated everywhere in the country; and it is good for that Board to know, also by way of the discussion which took place here this afternoon, that they have the support of both sides of this House. I want to ask hon. members on both sides of this House that in their wanderings all over the country, they should take cognisance as far as possible of the work which this Board is doing, and if there is something which they do not like, to broach the matter, or if there is something which they believe can be improved, to raise the matter with us so that it may receive the necessary attention. I thank everyone who participated in this short discussion and for their support.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the proposed amendments contained in the Bill are in no way of a far-reaching nature and I want to express the hope that I shall have the general support of hon. members for this measure.</p>

<p>The amendments we are dealing with here are in the main aimed at&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) facilitating administration,</li>

<li>(2) further activating the territorial authorities to whom partial self-government has already been allocated in respect of education in their areas, and</li>

<li>(3) placing Native education in South-West Africa under the same legislation as applies to Bantu education in the Republic.</li>

</ol>

<p>Section 9 of the Bantu Education Act regulates the registration of Bantu schools and all powers and duties in regard to the registration of such schools are vested in the Minister. These comprise for example the following&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Approval of the registration of each school and the imposition of conditions for registration.</li>

<li>(2) Extension of the registration of schools registered for specified periods.</li>

<li><span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0392"/>(3) Cancellation of registration for noncompliance with conditions of registration.</li>

<li>(4) Amendment, rescindment and addition of conditions of registration.</li>

<li>(5) Approval for the change in location of registered schools.</li>

<li>(6) Reclassification of schools.</li>

<li>(7) Approval for any change of ownership of schools.</li>

</ol>

<p>Some of these duties can to good effect be assigned to the head of the Department. In the absence of the necessary powers of delegation, it has not been possible to make such an arrangement. Section 9 is consequently being suitably supplemented now so that the Minister may delegate or assign some of his powers and duties to the Secretary of Bantu Education. This measure ought to facilitate and expedite the administration.</p>

<p>In addition it is being proposed that the Minister can exempt homeland territories in respect of which Bantu territorial authorities, or legislative councils (S.W.A.), have been established from the registration provisions of section 9 with effect from the specified dates. Territorial authorities and legislative councils to whom partial self-government has already been granted, are able under the legislation in terms of which such authorities and councils have been established, to promulgate measures in regard to certain matters, <i>inter alia,</i> the establishment, maintenance, management and control of educational institutions, and the promotion of school and other education. As section 9 is at present worded, schools in the homelands must be registered by the Minister. In order to activate to a greater extent the territorial authorities and legislative councils, to which partial self-government has already been granted, as well as the executive councils members in question and their education departments, it is being envisaged to leave it in due course to the territorial authorities and legislative councils concerned to promulgate their own measures in regard to the establishment and registration of schools in terms of which the executive council members and their education departments will then be able to administer the establishment and registration of their schools themselves. Section 10bis (1) (b) provides in what authority the power is invested to appoint, promote, to transfer and to dismiss teachers at Bantu community schools. It is vested in a Bantu council or Bantu body which the Minister himself can appoint in terms of section 12 (in this case Bantu school councils) or a Bantu authority or Bantu council appointed by or in terms of any other law (in this case territorial authorities) depending upon in which of the two bodies the control and management of a school is vested. However, territorial authorities are legislative organs which ought not to be burdened with administrative functions such as the appointment and dismissal of teachers. In terms of the proposed amendment it will be possible to vest these functions in homeland educational departments and the Executive Council members to whom educational matters have been entrusted.</p>

<p>In terms of section 12 of the principal Act the control and management of Bantu schools (community schools and State schools) may also be entrusted to one of two bodies, i.e. a Bantu council or Bantu body which the Minister himself may appoint, or to a Bantu authority or Bantu council established by or in terms of any other Act. What this amounts to in practice is that Bantu community schools are controlled and managed by either Bantu school councils established by the Minister himself, or territorial authorities which are assisted by their various education departments in the homelands. However, territorial authorities obtain control over certain aspects of education in their various territories in terms of the provisions of the Bantu Authorities Act, and proclamations promulgated in terms thereof by the State President. The provision which exists in section 12 in this respect, is therefore redundant and is consequently being deleted.</p>

<p>Clause 5 makes the Bantu Education Act applicable to the territory of South-West Africa, including the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel. In addition it repeals existing legislation in the territory and also contains certain transitional measures. This provision is being made in the spirit of the promise made by the hon. the Minister of the Interior last year to the effect that very sparing use would be made of the powers of the State President, as laid down in section 20 of the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969. Native education in South-West Africa was, before being taken over by the Department of Bantu Education on 1st April, 1969, administered on more or less the same basis and pattern as Bantu education in the Republic is being administered. After the takeover there was consequently no disruption and the rendering of educational services proceeded normally as in the past. This will also be the position now that the provisions of this Bill have been made applicable in South-West Africa. This is the case because the statutory provisions and the regulations which were applicable before and after the take-over of Native education in South-West Africa, were based on that of Bantu education in the Republic.</p>

<p>As a result of the amendment of section 12 of the Bantu Education Act, 1953, it is also necessary to effect a suitable amendment to section 8 of the Bantu Special Education Act, 1964. This being done in clause 6. In addition the latter Act is in future, just as in the case of the Bantu Education Act, also being made applicable to South-West Africa.</p>

<p>With that, Sir, I have dealt with the most important aspects of this Bill. The other <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0393"/>amendments are merely of a consequential nature.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support this Bill because again it is in keeping with our policy of allowing the different groups to control the affairs which intimately concern them, and one of those is, of course, education. In terms of this Bill the Minister will be giving more control to the Bantu committees themselves to control their education, and we approve of that. The Government Bantu schools are excluded, and I shall be glad if the Minister will tell us how many Government Bantu schools there are still in existence. As far as I know there are not very many. In the reserves I understand that the only ones which still exist are those which have white teachers. There are a few other Government schools on Government property, but I am concerned more with secondary schools where there are white teachers. I am speaking subject to correction now, but I should like to point out to the Minister that in the Transkei which, of course, has a different Constitution from the other reserves at the moment, there are schools which have white teachers, but which are nevertheless controlled by the Transkei Government. I should like to know why the same consideration cannot be given to other Government Bantu schools which have white teachers in the reserves. Why can they also not fall under the control of their territorial authorities, with the Government, of course, maintaining its right to appoint and dismiss white teachers, so that those white teachers will actually still be employed by the Government of the Republic? I understand that in the urban areas the community schools are controlled by school committees and school boards. In the Bantu areas there was provision for the Bantu authorities to control them, but as the Minister has explained, this provision is now being removed. As I read the Bantu Education Act, it was the regional authorities which could control the schools. The Deputy Minister has said that he is taking away the power to dismiss and employ teachers from the regional authorities, as they are concerned only with administration policy, but I hope it is not going to be the policy to take too much control away from these regional authorities, because they are after all the new governing bodies, and they should be trained to exercise proper control. By giving that authority to some other committee now, the Deputy Minister may in fact be undermining the authority of the regional authorities. We have not had any experience in this regard and I do not know how the granting of authority to the regional authorities is working out, but I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to bear this in mind. Although we are giving our approval here to the removal of certain powers from the Bantu authorities, we do not want to see the regional authorities deprived of their authority. I shall be glad if the Deputy Minister can tell us any more about the Government Bantu schools.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to listen to the hon. member for Transkei. When one reads the debates that were conducted when this legislation was first introduced by the late Dr. Verwoerd in this House in 1953 and sees how the reasoning has changed in the course of the years, one realizes that the Opposition has had no other course open to it but to accept the idiom of the National Party to a certain extent as far as the recognition of the diversity of the various ethnical groupings here in South Africa is concerned. The saying is true: One need only keep on long enough, and then the others will discover that they were wrong. At the time of the introduction of this Bantu Education, the people who laid down the principles on which it is based, said that the 1953 Bill would have very important and far-reaching effects. When we now look at the development of the education policy, we notice how it has grown in the course of the years. The changes introduced by this legislation are, from the nature of the case, not many. The only thing that is being done, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, is to improve the administration. Whereas there was an enormous lack of planning in respect of Bantu Education initially, and whereas the authority of the education bodies of the traditional Bantu community was affected&#x2014;I am not speaking of the authority of the family, of paternal authority&#x2014;we notice here that the education policy is coming progressively closer to what it basically was in the Bantu community before. I just want to say that the fact that these amendments are being made is proof that the Bantu, too, is accepting this education policy, and that it is integrating very harmoniously with the process of guardianship on the one hand and the process of emancipation on the other. I am sure that these amendments which are being affected here will only contribute to a further improvement later.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to support what has been said by the hon. member for Transkei. We very much welcome this new devolution of responsibility as set out in this Bill. A number of responsibilities are involved, starting with the question of the registration of Bantu schools, which is to be handed over to the territorial authority, or the legislative council if the school happens to be in South-West Africa. Reading the text of the Bill it is quite understandable that the dates on which these responsibilities can be transferred may differ in various areas.</p>

<p>The Bill permits the Minister to establish regional boards or local councils. I am not quite sure what a domestic council is. It is new terminology in the education field as far as I am concerned but perhaps I am merely ignorant in that regard. We do very much welcome the fact that these boards and committees, <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0394"/>which will be established by the Minister will consist of members of the Bantu community themselves. Then they will control and manage what we understand to be, and I hope I am correct in saying this, 90 per cent of the Bantu schools because in fact this means the community schools. There are very few Government schools that we know of still in existence. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can give us an assurance about the basis of payment of these teachers. This is not specified in the Bill although the Bill does deal with the appointment and dismissal of teachers. I should like him to give us an assurance that the basis of payment of these teachers remains unaltered. I take it that this is in fact the case.</p>

<p>In terms of this Bill the Minister also has power to disestablish, if he wishes, any of the committees or boards or domestic councils which he himself establishes, if he considers it necessary. We on this side of the House welcome what appears to be an entirely new principle in dealing with Bantu education, that is that if the Minister does disestablish any such board or committee, he has to give the outgoing committee a proper hearing. It is mandatory in terms of this Bill that they shall be give a hearing. I must say we welcome that because although this provision exists in regard to European and Coloured education it is something of an innovation as far as the handling of Bantu schools is concerned. I am quite sure that this will assist in maintaining a good spirit amongst the community concerned. We therefore welcome this provision as well.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has the power to prescribe the constitution, duties, powers and privileges, etc., of these boards and committees. I should like to express the hope that they will be given proper scope to manage these affairs of theirs in a really democratic way and that they will not be hamstrung by too many restrictions&#x2014;scope to the extent that they are competent to manage these affairs. I take it that in time these duties will be set out in the <i>Government Gazette</i> so that we will be able to see what they are. The hon. the Minister can tell us whether that is correct.</p>

<p>The control and management of special schools for handicapped children may also be given to the Bantu community themselves, where the Minister considers this to be suitable. I would have thought that it was a more difficult task, in many ways, to control special schools than it is to control ordinary community schools because special schools are, of course, for handicapped children. This involves specially trained teachers and a rather more complicated set-up. It would be very interesting to see how far the Minister thinks he can go in handing over this particular kind of responsibility.</p>

<p>Obviously the regularization of the position for accounting and pension purposes in respect of the universities of Fort Hare and Zululand and the University College of the North is something to which nobody can take exception, because we passed legislation last year giving these universities their own statutes. Their councils now control these finances. So, this is merely a consequential amendment to the Act arising out of the Acts of 1969. In regard to the general expression of views about how much tax we pay, I would like to end off by saying that the Bantu people <i>pro rata</i> contribute a very great deal to their education, perhaps more than any other race. I think in many cases they are made to contribute rather more than is fair under the circumstances towards their education. Because they contribute so much as things are at the moment, we particularly welcome the principle of giving back to them or handing over to them the greater responsibilities and the active participation of the community itself in the management and control of these schools to which they contribute to such a very large extent from their own pockets and from the general community funds which, as we know, are collected by them.</p>

<p>My last point is that, as the hon. member for Transkei has said, the school boards have been confined, as far as we know, to the urban areas and to Zululand at the moment. I take it that now that the hon. the Minister has established the Zululand Territorial Authority, he will not hesitate to hand over similar powers to the new Territorial Authority in Zululand as soon as it is properly established.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has really been a long time since the House was in such a pleasant and friendly mood as it is this afternoon. I appreciate it, I only hon. members on my side of the House are not beginning to think that there is something wrong with me because this legislation is going through so easily this afternoon.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to give hon. members the assurance that we on this side of the House adhere to our policy and that we are engaged in stating it strongly and positively and carrying it rapidly into effect. That is why one is grateful that the Opposition also supports the Bill this afternoon.</p>

<p>I have been asked how many State Bantu schools there are. It is a pleasure for me to say that there are at present seven of these schools in the Transvaal, three in the Cape, and 12 in Natal. Therefore, hon. members will see that there are only a few, i.e. a total of 22. In Natal, however, the Territorial Authority has not yet taken over Bantu education, and eight of the 12 schools in Natal are situated in the homeland. Let me at once express my appreciation towards hon. members, and particularly towards the hon. member for Wynberg for the sensible and friendly attitude <span class="col_761-762" refersTo="page_0395"/>which she adopted in regard to this matter. I want to inform her that in Natal, now that the Zulus have their own Territorial Authority, more powers will in due course probably be given to the Territorial Authority; including the important matter of Bantu Education.</p>

<p>The State Bantu schools are of course schools which are controlled directly by the department and which are fully financed by the department. This is the case in regard to all schools, with the exception of a few primary schools which are situated on State-owned property, such as forestry stations, Railway property etc. Except for these, they are post-primary schools throughout and there are White staff members on the establishment as well. The control and management of these schools is not being undertakend by Bantu school councils. When the control and management of a State Bantu school is transferred to the territorial authority, the school is known as a territorial school. These schools are controlled and managed by the territorial authority, but the appointment of White staff members is still controlled by the central department of Bantu education at the request of the territorial authority. I should like to emphasize this fact because it indicates very fine mutual co-operation which exists between the Bantu and our department in this regard. The White teachers are merely allocated to the territorial authority for service and retain the same conditions of service as before the allocation to the territorial authority, and remain on the establishment of the central department of Bantu education. With that I think I have furnished a full reply to the question of the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei further expressed the hope that not too many powers would be removed from the territorial authorities. This is an important question, but from the nature of the case we will not demolish those powers and take them away from them. We shall be extremely careful in dealing with the entire matter. The hon. member need therefore not be concerned about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg expressed the hope that these territorial authorities, and particularly the Department of Bantu Education of these territorial authorities, &#x201C;will get sufficient scope&#x201D;. It is in fact the intention of this amendment in the Bantu Education Bill to do precisely what that hon. member has asked for. We do in fact want to afford the Bantu Education Department greater opportunities. We want to, as was said in the Second Reading, activate them, but I just want to add that we will of course have to, and shall do this gradually. On the other hand, we are really eager to allocate more powers to the Bantu and this Bill is consequently an obvious demonstration of the desire on our part to allocate more and greater powers to them. I want to avail myself of this opportunity to make mention of the fact that it affords one great pleasure to see how many Bantu there are in practice who are undertaking these tasks with great responsibility; particularly with regard to what we mentioned a moment ago, namely Bantu Education.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to say that the hon. member for Wynberg was quite right in raising the point that special education was of course considerably more difficult. We realize this only too well and we will for that reason be more careful in regard to that type of education. We can however, mention with praise the Bantu who have with exceptional dedication already done important work in regard to special Bantu education in our country, and who are still doing it. In this pleasant and friendly spirit I want to move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>Motion put and agreed to.</p>
