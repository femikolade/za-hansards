<heading>THE LATE SIR DAVID HUNTER.</heading>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person></from>

<p>said that the sad and sudden report of the death of Sir David Hunter had come as a great shock to him, and he was sure that he was speaking on behalf of the whole House when he expressed his deep sense of loss at the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s demise. Sir David Hunter, the Prime Minister went on, came to South Africa in 1879, and ever since the date of his arrival he had rendered great service to Natal and South Africa. For twenty-seven years he was General Manager of the Natal Railways, but the whole of Sir David&#x2019;s thirty-five years in South Africa were characterised by his untiring efforts in the interests of the country which he had adopted. Sir David Hunter was highly respected <span class="col_3649-3650" refersTo="page_1831"/>by everyone who came into contact with him, and on railway matters he was always regarded as one of the country&#x2019;s greatest authorities. But he did not limit his activities to the official sphere only. On social, religious and philanthropic matters he also rendered yeoman service to the people in the country. He was always doing his utmost to do something for the country and to improve the conditions of the people. In conclusion, the Prime Minister said that he felt sure that he was voicing the sentiment of this House and of the country at large, when he expressed regret at the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s demise and when he expressed his sense of condolence with the relatives of the deceased. The Prime Minister then moved:</p>

<p>&#x201C; That this House has learned with the deepest regret of the death of Sir David Hunter, K.C.M.G., member for Durban, Central, and places on record its sense of the great loss sustained by Parliament and by the Union in consequence of this sad event. This House also records its appreciation of the valuable services rendered by the late gentleman as a member of this branch of the Legislature, recognising that the generous placing of his talents at the disposal of the country in this manner after a strenuous and distinguished career as General Manager of the Natal Government Railways over a period of twenty-seven years marked the deep and true interest the deceased member took in this country, the land of his adoption.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. W. SMARTT</person> (Fort Beaufort),</from>

<p>in seconding, said that death had laid a heavy hand on both branches of the Legislature since the first establishment of the Union Parliament. In Sir David Hunter it had taken from them one who had not made a single enemy in the House during his membership. Sir David Hunter had rendered distinguished services to this country, and his advice would be sadly missed in discussing important matters in connection with railway development in South Africa, but over and above everything else, Sir David was an example of a class which, unfortunately, was becoming scarcer in South Africa and every other country. He was one of those whose daily life was an example of what true religion really was He lived justly and he loved mercy and worked humbly and the country was poorer by his death. In every movement for the betterment of the people he was an outstanding figure, and not only the House, but the whole country was considerably poorer by his death. The sympathy of the House went out to his family, and especially to the people of Natal, who had lost one of their best and most faithful friends.</p>

<p>said that they on the cross-benches would like to associate themselves with the remarks which had just fallen. They read with the deepest regret the announcement of the death of Sir David Hunter, who, however much one might differ from him politically, always inspired those with whom he came into contact with feelings of affection and respect.</p>

<speech by="#henderson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. HENDERSON</person> (Durban, Berea)</from>

<p>said that, as one of the Natal members and as one of the late Sir David Hunter&#x2019;s colleagues in the representation of Durban, he might perhaps be allowed to add one word. The news this morning came as a great blow to those who were from Natal, for they had been hoping that he would recover from his severe illness and be with them perhaps during next session. He could only endorse the words that had fallen from the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. Sir David Hunter would be greatly missed in Natal and especially in Durban. He was the &#x201C;Grand Old Man &#x201D; of Durban. He had been associated with them in Durban for many years. He had been associated with every movement for the good of the town. As regarded his personal character, they all knew what it was, and he was indeed a knight &#x201C;sans peur et sans reproche.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The motion was agreed to, members rising in their places.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person></from>

<p>moved the second reading of the Second Appropriation (Part) Bill. He said that when they passed the last Appropriation Bill it was not anticipated that the session would last for such a long period. They had already reached the 22nd of June and there was still work before them. That being so, they had to ask for additional appropriation. The amount that had been asked would carry them as far as the 11th July. He had asked for that amount because it was not right to take further risks in the matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#macneillie">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MacNEILLIE</person> (continuing)</from>

<p>said the matter he wished to bring to the notice of the House was one of the greatest, importance and was one which affected every farmer in the Union of South Africa. Last week he had presented a petition from a farmer of Natal Spruit, near Johannesburg&#x2014;Mr. J. Wentworth Sykes. That gentleman had been growing a lot of valuable grass. He (Dr. MacNeillie) had also presented a second petition which had been signed by 1,678 farmers throughout the Union. The petition set out that the grass had been set on fire by sparks from an engine. Mr. Sykes sent in a claim to the Railway Administration, which replied that the engine had been properly equipped with spark arresters and therefore they refused to consider the claim. Mr. Sykes brought an action in the Magistrates&#x2019; Court for &#x00A3;50 damages, and the Magistrate said the burden of proof was shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant in that case. The Railway Administration was not satisfied with that decision and appealed to the Provincial Division of the High Court, and there the decision of the Court below was unanimously upheld. Then that poor tenant farmer had again to suffer an appeal The case was brought before the Appellate Division of the High Court, and there by a bare majority of one the decision was reversed. It was there held that the onus of proof was on the plaintiff to prove that the engine was not properly equipped with spark arresters. If that was the law to-day then it would be impossible for any farmer to win a similar action for damages. If that is law to-day then it was the duty of this House to see that it did not remain the law for long. He believed that it was a well-established principle in the rules of the law of evidence that in some cases where a party made a negative averment and the facts involved were so peculiarly within the knowledge of the other party that it was practically impossible for the party alleging to prove the negative that the burden of proof was put on the party within whose knowledge the facts were and not on the party alleging If a farmer proved he had sustained damage through a locomotive, then, the burden of proof ought to rest on the Railway Administration to prove that the engine was properly equipped with spark arresters. The Legislature of this country had authorised the construction of railways in this country, they had authorised the use of locomotives on these railways and insofar as&#x2014;apart from negligence&#x2014;the use of such things caused damage to others they had no claim, but the Legislature of this country had never authorised negligence, but if the decision of the Appellate Division is to remain law then it means that the Legislature has authorised negligence, for in the future it will be impossible to prove negligence on the part of the Railway Administration. He charged the Railway Administration of not having acted impartially in the past and with having act id unjustly and harshly.</p>

<p>The hon. member contrasted the case of Mr. Sykes with that of a fire on the farm Rusthof in the Transvaal, where 567 gum trees were alleged to have been destroyed through sparks from a locomotive. The manager of the farm put in a claim tor &#x00A3;168 15s., but no explanation was given of the cause of the fire, which might easily have been caused by natives as by sparks from an engine. The grass within the railway fence had been burnt off and was quite clean All engines which passed the farm of Rusthof during the night of the fire were equipped with spark arresters. The Railway Administration sent the Government Horticulturist to assess the damage, and this gentleman said that as far as he could see no trees had been destroyed and that &#x00A3;15 to &#x00A3;20 would pay the whole of the damage. The Railway Administration settled the claim for &#x00A3;20, and the manager of the farm, in acknowledging its receipt, said it would not half cover the cost of replacing the trees. The Railway Administration, said the hon. member, had no right to pay that claim, and in view of this case he thought the treatment of Mr. Sykes was iniquitous. In conclusion, Dr. MacNeillie urged that on the Railway Administration should be thrown the burden of proof as to whether engines were properly equipped with spark arresters and whether these arresters were in good working condition.</p>

<speech by="#smuts">

<from>&#x2020;General <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. SMUTS</person> (Ermelo)</from>

<p>said he could not agree with the onus of proof being on the farmer in cases of veld fires. It was exceptionally difficult, not to say impossible, for farmers to prove the number of the engine responsible for the fire, and at the same time to prove negligence. If the train passed in the night time, it was obviously a total impossibility to prove such things. The decision of the court of appeal constituted a great danger for the farmer. How was it possible for the farmer to prove that the spark arrester was not in good order at the time&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wilcocks">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. T. M. WILCOCKS</person> (Fauresmith)</from>

<p>held that farmers were placed in an impossible position. He knew of a case where an engine caused a fire, and arrived at Johannesburg with the spark arrester. The question, however, was whether the spark arrester was in order on the engine and in good order when the fire was caused&#x003F; How <span class="col_3653-3654" refersTo="page_1833"/>was it possible for the farmer to prove that was not the ease&#x003F; It was impossible. It was unfair to lay the onus of proof on the farmer.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. J. W. DU TOIT (Middelburg</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#keyter">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. KEYTER</person> (Ficksburg)</from>

<p>said even if an owner of land could give the number of the engine he would have to prove negligence. The trouble, however, was that in addition to the permanent way the farmer had to allow 200 feet on both sides of the line to be burned. After that veld had been burned the farmer ran great risks of losing his cattle, as the result of poisonous weeds growing on the burned parts. The Minister ought to see the seriousness of the complaint.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. W. SMARTT</person> (Fort Beaufort)</from>

<p>said that if the damage was done by the railway the public should bear the expense, for whose benefit the railways were run. Referring to Mr. Sykes&#x2019; case, the hon. member said that there was a spark arrester on the engine, but whether it had been working efficiently or not was another question. The fireman of the engine had not been called, and it did seem an extraordinary thing that the man who might have been able to throw some light on the matter had not been called. The case had gone to the Supreme Court of Pretoria, where three judges had given judgment in favour of the farmer. The department had then taken that unfortunate man to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, with the result that two judges had given a verdict in favour of Mr. Sykes and three judges against him. He was informed on very reliable authority that if Mr. Sykes wanted to go further&#x2014; not only that he himself wanted to do so, but several other farmers wanted him to do so and he (Sir T. W. Smartt) understood that &#x00A3;500 or &#x00A3;600 had been subscribed to allow the case to go forward to the Privy Council&#x2014;he understood the expenses would be &#x00A3;1,200 or &#x00A3;1,300, besides incidental expenses. He asked the Minister of Railways and Harbours whether he considered it quite fair the way the department was acting. He considered it would only be an act of grace to return that man the money he had already expended on the undertaking. It was an extremely difficult thing for an individual to fight a wealthy corporation. He hoped the Minister would go into the matter. He said that the Railway Department should pay an individual compensation when there was such a fire and a reasonable case had been made out that the fire had been caused through a defect on the engine.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fawcus">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FAWCUS</person> (Umlazi)</from>

<p>said that, as representing a farming district in Natal, where he thought they were more subject to serious loss by such fires than any other part of South Africa, he thought it his duty to say a few words on that matter, more especially as he had been Chairman of the Select Committee which had discussed that matter and had come to certain decisions. He did not quite follow the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition as to the general public having to bear the cost. If the railway carried goods they must add the cost to those whose goods were carried. He was one of those who held that the engines were not supplied with proper spark arresters. (Hear, hear.) The present spark arrester was part of the engine and like a kind of Venetian shutter in the smoke box, and could not get out of order because it was a fixed part of the engine. He thought he could arrest more sparks with a tin umbrella above the chimney than by means of the present spark arrester. (Hear, hear.) There could be no doubt that if the responsibility for these fires was brought home to the Government their frequency would be very greatly reduced. Not only did the Government put all possible hindrances against the man who had sustained damages from obtaining them, but forms were sent to them asking them to indemnify the Government if they had cultivated crops within 300 feet of the railway fences. He had had such a form himself, and he was told that if he had the temerity to cultivate within 300 feet of the railway fence he must indemnify the Government because a fire occurred. (Laughter.) Not only did the Government take 100 feet, but another 300 feet on each side might not be cultivated, because the Government would not bear responsibility. These were the disabilities they were suffering under when they had State control, a matter he had drawn attention to before. (Ironical Labour cheers.) In 1911 the concluding paragraph of the report of the Railway Land Appropriation Select Committee was that the committee further recommended that all locomotives should be fitted with effective spark arresters. He did not think the Government had stirred a hand to further these recommendations. He did appeal to the Minister to do something to prevent fires caused by railway locomotives and that when they had occurred he would accept responsibility for them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#merriman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. X. MERRIMAN</person> (Victoria West)</from>

<p>said that it was perfectly clear that if they were going to bring their crops right up to the railways there was no human invention which could prevent these fires. The matter was not such a simple one as his hon. friend (Mr. Fawcus) seemed to think. One session his hon. friend had advocated that crops should be brought close to the railway by narrowing the width taken for the railway and the next session he thought that the thunders of heaven <span class="col_3655-3656" refersTo="page_1834"/>should be brought down on the Railway Department because these fires had occurred. He thought this dragging about of people from Court to Court in connection with claims for compensation for damage caused by fires was an absolute denial of justice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boydell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. BOYDELL</person> (Durban, Greyville)</from>

<p>said that, in supporting the motion, he might quote a ease which bore out what had been said by the right hon. the member for Victoria West in regard to the denial of justice to the poor man. He had in his mind one particularly hard case where a man had been compelled to go to Court and spend a considerable amount of money in order to have his character cleared. He proposed to give the particulars now so that the Minister would have an opportunity, before they came to the Railway Estimates, of making an inquiry. A ticket-examiner in the Railway Service of Natal, and employed at Durban, had a charge laid against him by a passenger. He was brought before the railway officials and an inquiry was instituted and the charge was found to be proved. He was dismissed from the service. He then appealed to the Assistant General Manager and again the charge was supposed to be proved against him. He next appealed to the Railway Board, he (Mr. Boydell) believed, and again his discharge was upheld. He then brought an action in the Court of the Chief Magistrate at Durban and claimed damages for slander and defamation of character. The Chief Magistrate went fully into the case and found that the charge against this man was entirely unjustified. He was awarded damages. What was the position&#x003F; The man lost his job on account of the charge laid against him and he had had to pay a considerable sum of money in order to clear his character. He wished the Minister to go into this case with a view, if possible, of the reinstatement of the man in the service, or at any rate of reimbursing the costs to which he had been subjected in order to clear himself from this unfounded charge. He had had to spend &#x00A3;100 in order to clear his character</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. L. BOTHA</person> (Bloemfontein)</from>

<p>said he was afraid that there was a tendency on the part of the Department to contest in every Court of law every claim for compensation which was brought forward. In this respect they seemed to be following the practice of the English railway companies. On the other hand, he found from the report of the Select Committee on Public Accounts one case where the Department had actually paid compensation in breach of their own regulations. An amount of &#x00A3;625 wat paid to Sir Owen Philipps in respect of damage to a motor-car at the docks. He found from the regulations of the Cape that liability was limited to &#x00A3;100. He would like to know what would have happened if this claim had been made by a poor farmer, who was not in such a good position to enforce his claim. He imagined that the Department would have taken the case into Court.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person></from>

<p>said that if the hon. member for Greyville would come to his office and give him particulars of the case to which he had referred he would certainly inquire into it. He had no recollection of any of the facts to which the hon. member had made reference. In regard to the other matters of claims for compensation, the hon. member for Victoria West was mistake in supposing that the Department contested every claim for compensation. If anything, the tendency was rather in the opposite direction. In many of these cases while ones sympathy in the event of fires caused by passing trains was certainly with the farmers who were affected, there was no doubt that if the claims were not contested the Railway Administration would not be doing its duty to the taxpayers of this country. If they did not contest claims which they were advised were not reasonable claims, they would very soon be flooded8 with applications for compensation. As to the question of the limitation of the department&#x2019;s liability, he was not going into the details of the case mentioned by the hon. member for-Bloemfontein, but he might say that, not only in the case of Sir Owen Philipps, but in other cases the department&#x2019;s limit of liability was occasionally departed from. He now came to the other matter which had been raised with regard to fires. He entirely agreed with what had been said on both sides of the House as to what the natural sympathy was He made the House a promise last year that he would go into this question and deal with it at an early opportunity. Although one&#x2019;s sympathy was with the farmers, and it was one&#x2019;s desire and intention to minimise the risk of these fires from trains, at the same time he had to bear in mind his duty to the country at large.</p>

<p>They should see that that money was not paid out unnecessarily or unreasonably. There was no doubt that the right hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. Merriman) had hit one nail on the head in pointing out the importance of the question of the breadth of fire breaks. Farmers naturally wanted them to be as narrow as possible, and he sympathised with them in that. But if they made the breaks too narrow they could not prevent fires. They might have a perfectly good spark arrester, but no arrangement had been devised yet which would prevent sparks flying out of the funnel. The only way they could diminish the risk of fire was by having a fairly wide fire break. There was a new contrivance, but its application to all engines would involve a very heavy expenditure indeed. With regard to the case of Mr. Wentworth Sykes, he wished to say that he never took those cases to courts if he thought the claim was a reasonable one. They were paying out money in connection with fires every day, but in that <span class="col_3657-3658" refersTo="page_1835"/>particular case there had been an important principle involved, and that was the question of negligence. If the Railway Department had to pay out for every fire along the line without taking into consideration the question of negligence, they would have to pay out a large sum of money. What had they got a Court of Appeal for but to take cases to it if they were not satisfied with the decision of the lower court. They had taken that particular case to the Court of Appeal because the question of negligence was raised. Still he had felt that the matter had pressed hardly on Mr. Sykes, and as an important principle of law had been decided, he had instructed the Railway Administration not to press for any costs against Mr. Sykes. It had been felt that the legal point should be settled, otherwise they would be pressed for payment all over the country on similar grounds. The matter of fire had had his earnest consideration during the recess, and he had considered the settling of the central question of the burden of proof. At the first opportunity next session he intended to make the necessary provision for minimising damage which might be caused by fires, and he hoped that they would have fair play for the Railway Administration as well as for the farmers.</p>

The expenditure during that month was &#x00A3;1,&#x2018;092,000. Taking that as a basis, the total expenditure up to date should be &#x00A3;2,730,000, which left a balance still to be spent of something like a million of money.

<p>said that at a previous stage of that session the question had been raised as to the retaining of the old line between Mooi River and Estcourt in Natal. He had understood from the Minister that there would be little chance of the old line being retained. For some time there had been a motion on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg, South, dealing with the running of certain trains over the old portion of the line. That motion was reached last Tuesday, and subsequently the hon. member said he had certain assurances from the Minister and that he would withdraw the motion. He (Mr. Meyler) would like to know the nature of those assurances.</p>

<p>said that when the deviation was decided on the question of whether the old line should still be used was considered, but the Administration had decided that it would not be a business-like thing to do to retain that line. They could not run both lines. The assurance he had given the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg, South, was that they would allow the line to be used as long as they reasonably could&#x2014;that would mean another four or five months.</p>

<p>said what the hon. member for Cape Town, Castle, had said certainly emphasised the danger of rushing legislation, for under the very thinly veiled threats of the Ministers hon. members felt that adequate discussion of many of these matters had not been possible in committee. He (Mr. Creswell) felt distinct qualms about the first clause, which provided that employers need not pay compensation <i>&#x201C;</i> in so far as the incapacity or death would not have been caused, but for a pre-existing diseased condition of the workman and such condition was unknown to the employer.&#x201D; This might open the door to an enormous amount of litigation. For instance, a man might be rheumatically disposed and might be crippled in the course of his employment, and consequently fall from a scaffold. In another case a man might receive an injury <span class="col_3659-3660" refersTo="page_1836"/>which but for the pre-existing disease would not incapacitate him altogether, but the two combined might lead to his entire incapacitation. The proviso to which he had called attention was an innovation, and would provide employers and insurance companies with a fruitful source of reasons upon which to contest claims for compensation.</p>

<p>moved that the amendments be considered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#creswell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. H. P. CRESWELL</person> (Jeppe)</from>

<p>moved, as an amendment, that the Order for the consideration of the amendments be discharged, and that Chapter I of the Bill, with the exception of clause 5, be recommitted. When hon. members called to their minds the circumstances under which this portion of the Bill went through committee they would see that his request was not an unreasonable one. There was a clear misunderstanding, and the motion that the Chairman leave the Chair was looked upon as an obstructive one, but hon. members on the cross-benches felt that the debate on the second reading had unexpectedly collapsed. The debate on the former motion was unfortunately brought to a very early close through the application of the closure, and the House went into committee without, possibly, that deliberative temper which would best conduce to the discussion of these very important clauses. When they discussed the first long and very complicated clause there was a refusal by the Minister to take the paragraphs seriatim, with the result that the discussion on the whole clause was of the most unsatisfactory nature possible. (Hear, hear.) A number of amendments were before the committee at the same time, and the state of irritation in which the House went into committee was distinctly accentuated.</p>

<p>Instead of having a cool discussion as they should have had, it had become rather a trial of endurance, and one section of the House had been absent altogether. Having referred to clauses 3 and 4, the hon. member assured the Minister that they on the cross-benches would not take the advantage of obstructing, and they did desire discussion under rather different circumstances than had been the case on Friday week. If his motion was agreed to, he thought it would facilitate the passage of that Bill, and have good results. He did not say that they on those benches withdrew one iota of their opposition to the principles of the Bill, but as the House had decided on the Bill, let them have a committee stage in reality and consider these amendments on their merits, and modify some of the roughness of the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person></from>

<p>said that he hoped the hon. member would not press that motion. After all, they had discussed these clauses. He said that these clauses had been discussed late that night. Clause 1 was discussed for about four hours, and except on a question whether hon. members were absolutely against that on principle, he did not think it could be said that he was unreasonable. As to the amendment of the hon. member for Fordsburg (Mr. Duncan), in section 3, at the time he had thought it weakened it too much, but he would accept it to-day. As to the amendment of the hon. member for Weenen (Mr. Meyler), in section 4, he had a great deal of sympathy with that amendment, but as soon as they laid down a formula they were at once on very dangerous ground. He had no strong feeling himself on that point, and if the feeling of the House was that some formula should be put in, he would be prepared to accept it. The only section the hon. member could make some point on was going into committee on section 1. He (the Minister) wanted to make it clear that on a second conviction they could only give imprisonment when the fine was not paid. He thought he had met hon. members in as reasonable a way as possible, always assuming that there were certain principles on which they were diametrically opposed to each other. He thought they would only unnecessarily use up the time of the House if at such a late stage of the session the Bill was recommitted.</p>

<p>said that he was sorry to hear the Minister speak as he had done, and he was evidently in the same state of mind as he was in when the Bill had been previously before the House. He admitted that there had been four hours&#x2019; debate on clause 1, but most of the discussion had come from the Labour benches. The House had been very attenuated at that time, and it must be frankly confessed that that Bill had not been thoroughly and properly considered by the whole of that Assembly. They were asked to consider amendments now which had been passed by practically only a third of <span class="col_3661-3662" refersTo="page_1837"/>the members, and most of those had been in a somnolent state at the time. The Minister had been reasonable in the latter stages of the Bill, but not in the first part.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. H. P. CRESWELL</person> (Jeppe)</from>

<p>said that these penalties were altogether too high. The Minister would tell them probably that they were the maximum penalty, but when they came to look at what the &#x201C;crime&#x201D; was, he thought the Minister must be bound to admit that these penalties were far too heavy.</p>

<p>As the Minister would understand, the whole of the penalties in this Bill were, in their opinion, too high, and he would suggest that, as, in a subsequent clause, the Minister had reduced the penalty from &#x00A3;200 or 2 years&#x2019; imprisonment, he should do the same here. He moved to delete &#x201C;&#x00A3;200&#x201D; in the lines 30 and 31 and substitute &#x201C;&#x00A3;50,&#x201D; to delete &#x201C;one year &#x201D; in line 32 and substitute &#x201C;6 months,&#x201D; and to delete all the words there from to the end of the paragraph.</p>

<p>said that in Ireland at the time when the Lord Lieutenant had the power alone of prohibiting meetings the punishment was three months. It did seem to him an excessive punishment for the offences here dealt with, because, after all, this was not a crime like refusing to disperse from a disorderly meeting. They had reduced the penalty upon that very much indeed, and he thought very reasonably. A penalty of &#x00A3;50 or six months&#x2019; would, he thought, fit the case, unless they wanted to go back to the brave old days when you could impose death without benefit of clergy.</p>

He did not agree with the remainder of the amendment, and he would move in line 33 to delete &#x201C;5&#x201D; and substitute &#x201C;1,&#x201D; and in the following line to delete &#x201C;two years &#x201D; and substitute &#x201C;one year.&#x201D;</p>

If the Minister would not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Jeppe, then, on the principle of accepting half a loaf if they could not get the whole loaf, they would be prepared to support the amendment. He hoped, however, the hon. member for Von Brandis would withdraw his amendment. The right hon. gentleman had mentioned the Irish Crimes Act, or, as it was better known, the Coercion Act. Did the Minister not know-what was the result of that Act in Ireland&#x003F; The result was not the prevention of meetings, although big gatherings in public places were prevented. What did happen was that these people took to the fields and ditches, and had hole-and-corner meetings, a very bad thing for any community. In short the Irish movement was driven underground. That was what would happen in this country.</p>

<p>said the Government did not wish, to have an oppressive penalty, but, he had considerably modified the original penalty. It was not a question of what was the, lightest punishment. That was the maximum punishment the Magistrate could impose. Supposing a particular public meeting on the Parade could be prohibited, because the Government feared that the result would be bloodshed, but in spite of that a man insisted on holding the meeting and a good many people were killed, then he thought the maximum punishment was a punishment which a man would deserve. Was &#x00A3;250 or a year&#x2019;s imprisonment too high a punishment for that&#x003F; He could not accept any&#x2019; amendment which provided for lesser punishment than the punishment provided in the amendment, and he would accept the amendment of the hon. member for George. When the order had been given, rightly or wrongly, prohibiting a meeting, it was the duty of the Government to see that that order was obeyed. No Government in the world would lightly prohibit a public meeting. The Government Would very carefully consider the matter before prohibiting a meeting, but when the order was given it should be obeyed, and any man who disobeyed that order should be severely punished. As regarded the speech of the hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Maginess), he did not know anything about the prohibition of a meeting on Saturday night. He had tried to get into communication with the police during the luncheon hour to find out the exact circumstances, but he was not successful. It seemed that it was a meeting in the public street which was dealt with by by-laws and that it was just moved on. With regard to the point raised by the hon. member for Roodepoort, of course a meeting held at Claremont would be an entirely different meeting to the one held at the Good Hope Hall.</p>

<p>said that on the occasion of the consideration of clause 15 in committee, he withdrew a very important amendment. He understood that clause 15 had received the support of the Government by the mere fact of its inclusion in the Bill, and that it had also the support of a large number of members on the Opposition side of the House. It had been said that he was prompted in the lines he had adopted because he had experienced difficulties in being heard by the public, but he had never yet been refused a hearing personally at any public meeting, but he had been present at meetings when large numbers of people had been refused a hearing. On one occasion Sir Percy Fitzpatrick endeavoured to enter a hall to address a public meeting, and he was hustled and knocked about very seriously, so that his health must have been seriously affected thereby. When he (Mr. Nathan) withdrew the little Bill that he had published, there appeared in a quarter one least expected it&#x2014;in the columns of &#x201C;The Worker&#x201C;&#x2014;a paragraph condemning the Bill.

<p>moved in sub-section (1), line 12, after &#x201C;district&#x201D; to insert: &#x201C;Provided that in respect to a public meeting within the area of a municipality the magistrate shall consult with and obtain from the Mayor of such municipality his opinion in writing as to whether such meeting should be <span class="col_3667-3668" refersTo="page_1840"/>prohibited before any such meeting is prohibited under this section.&#x201D; He said he did not think that sufficient attention had been paid to the question of the grave responsibility which was thrown upon one man in deciding whether a meeting should be prohibited or not Personally, he did not believe in the prohibition of any meeting until it had become disorderly. The Minister considered that it was necessary to prohibit a meeting if the magistrate or some other person thought it might become disorderly. He (Mr. Sampson) considered that in placing that power in the hands of the Magistrate he was imposing too great a responsibility upon him. It was desirable that that responsibility should be shared, and he thought there was no better person with whom that responsibility should be shared than the Mayor of the town. In this connection the hon. member quoted from an article in &#x201C;Harper&#x2019;s Weekly&#x201D; in reference to two meetings held in New York on April 4th and 11th of this year of the unemployed, one of which resulted in a number of casualties after the police had attempted to break up the meeting, and the other, although much more numerously attended, ended peacefully, no attempt being made by the police to break up the meeting.</p>

Some 2,000 railwaymen were on strike. It was arranged that a big meeting should be held. The Government brought down troops from Pietermaritzburg. The police of Durban were a borough force. The hon. member for Victoria County (Mr. Henwood), who was then Mayor of Durban, intervened, and requested the military to remain on Government property. He stated that the men concerned were citizens, that he could trust them, and that, as Mayor, he had got charge of the order of the town.

<p>said that the hon. member (Mr. Struben) had stated that the effect of this proviso would be to drag the unfortunate Mayor into political quarrels. Was that the object of the Bill&#x003F; It seemed to him that the object of the Bill was to try and put down Labour meetings. The fact of the matter was that the ultimate decision with regard to the prohibition or breaking up of meetings rested with the police. They claimed that the chief civic officer of the town was most likely to know his citizens and to be in a position to advise as to what would be the best course of action in regard to meetings. Wherever a meeting was referred to in this Bill was about to be held, or was being held within the bounds of a municipality, the Mayor of the town was the man who should be conferred with by the magistrate before that meeting was prohibited.</p>

<p>said the proposal that the Mayor should express his opinion in writing was done with the object of protecting the Mayor in subsequent investigations. In times of excitement different people held different views as to what had occurred, and that had been proved in Johannesburg. If the Mayor did definitely say something to the Magistrate or to the police it should be written down so that there could be no misunderstanding as to what he had meant. That was, however, not a material point, and if they could get the larger principle adopted he did not think the mover of the amendment would mind. Self-government should be carried as far as possible. Let them take the case of Manchester. During the railway trouble of two or three years ago, the Mayor of Manchester had said that it was entirely in consequence of the action of the Government authorities that any disorder or bloodshed took place. He wished the police all over South Africa were in the same position as the police in Durban and other Natal towns&#x2014;that was, under the control of the municipalities.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. X. MERRIMAN</person> (Victoria West)</from>

<p>said he did not like the prohibition of meetings much, but now that they had got prohibition, the Minister had shown himself as in a very &#x201C;coming on&#x201D; frame of mind. He had lowered the penalties and had met with a storm of opposition and a derision. That was disheartening to anybody. His hon. friend who had just spoken did not show much knowledge of the affairs of this country. In Manchester the Mayor was a Magistrate, he was the Chief Magistrate, but here they had an entirely different state of affairs. The Magistrate here was an officer of the Government, he was a stipendiary, and did not act without being specially instructed to act by the Minister.</p>

<p><span class="col_3669-3670" refersTo="page_1841"/>They had got that in the Bill, and surely they ought to be satisfied with it. While the Mayor was hesitating, they might have the whole place in a state of uproar. The chief object of officers of the Government was not to be popular; the chief object was to see that the laws were obeyed. He hoped the Minister would let the clause pass as it was Some places had not got a Mayor, and all meetings were not held in municipalities. He had unhappily known people break the law outside municipalities.</p>

<p>said the right hon. gentleman who had just spoken had, as usual, led them all adrift. They agreed that the Minister had met them and they were glad of it. With regard to that particular matter he wanted to impress on the Minister that he was going to do no harm by accepting it. It was not a question of a breach of the law. It was a question of whether they were going to prohibit a meeting which would otherwise be legal. It was a question of whether they were going to make Crime or not He did not think the Magistrate was the best man to advise the police. The Mayor should be consulted. They suggested that they should have some documentary evidence of the consultation with the Mayor. The utmost that could happen would be that the Mayor would disagree with the Magistrate and the whole responsibility would be thrown on the Magistrate.</p>

<p>said that question had been discussed in committee and had been rejected by a very large majority. He did not think the Mayors could claim the mantle of infallibility which had been thrown over them by come hon. members. The Magistrates were the responsible custodians of law and order. The Mayor was not responsible for law and order. If the police were in the same position as those in Durban, under the control of the municipality, the matter would be different. If so many safeguards were put into the Bill it seemed to him that it would take about three months before a meeting could be prohibited. The Magistrate naturally would consult people if he was not quite clear what advice he should tender to the Ministry. He hoped the House would reject the amendment.</p>

His idea was not in any way to weaken the Bill, but he did think they should have something more formal-than appeared in the Bill as printed. Although he had put forward a certain formula of words, if the Minister did not like those particular words, he (Mr. Meyler) would be prepared to accept any suggestion he had to make with regard to fresh words. He desired to safeguard the public so that they might have due warning when force was about to be employed at any meeting. According to the clause as printed, a police officer was to obtain the attention of the public according to the means he deemed most suitable.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person></from>

<p>said that this was a most difficult subject and one upon which he had no very decided opinion. It was a question upon which there was much to be said for or against. His own personal opinion was that, looking at it more from the point of view of the unfortunate police officer who was called upon to disperse a meeting, the more he was weighted with these formulae and regulations, the more difficult was it for him to carry out his duties properly. If a police officer called upon a meeting to disperse and omitted one of these words in the formula of the hon. member, it would be argued in a Court of law that he had not carried out his duties properly, and the whole thing would be illegal, and everything would be upset, because the officer had not followed the exact formula which had been laid down in the law. Nobody would have been put to any disadvantage by it, but simply because the formula had not been carried out this officer would render himself liable to punishment. From his personal point of view, it seemed to him that they had put the matter quite clearly in the clause, that the officer should endeavour to obtain the attention of these persons by such lawful means as he deemed most suitable. In Law 6, 1894 (Transvaal) they had a very brief, crisp formula which read: &#x201C;Obedience to the law; disperse, otherwise force will be used.&#x201D; He thought the amendment as it stood put the onus upon the unfortunate police officer of either blowing the bugle or beating the drum himself.</p>

<p>said that the Transvaal Law not only provided for the words mentioned being declared by the officer of police, but he had to call attention by means of a drum or bugle and to call out the words three times in a loud voice. A formula of some sort had been used in England for the last 200 years. Surely it was not essential that the police officer should commit it to memory. In any disorder in England the Riot Act was read. If the officer had the formula in print before him he would not be likely to make any mistake in the language. He wished the Minister would devote a third of his zeal in the interest of the police officer to the ordinary citizen. The police officer did not stand much chance of being shot, but he was going to be the cause of the trouble. No stone should be left unturned by them in seeing that the people who were most concerned should thoroughly understand the drift of what was happening on the platform when the officer was taking steps to disperse the meeting.</p>

<p>On clause 20,</p>

<speech by="#smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. W. SMARTT</person> (Fort Beaufort)</from>

<p>moved, the following addition to clause 20: &#x201C;Provided further that this section shall only apply to persons (a) who have been convicted of the crimes mentioned herein by a Provincial or Local Division or by the Special Criminal Court constituted under section 18; and (b) in whose case a recommendation has been made by the Court before which they were so convicted that the provisions of this section should be applied.&#x201D; Sir T. W. Smartt said his reason for making that proposal was that the Opposition had thought it advisable that under no circumstances should anybody be deported except he had been convicted by a judge and, besides his conviction, the character of his crime was of such a nature that deportation should be carried out. It was an entirely different provision to the deportation which had taken place some time ago. The previous deportations took place at a time when there was no legislation such as was provided in that Bill to deal with unrest of that character. The position in that case was entirely different from the position which it was proposed to deal with in the Bill. If the clause went through without amendment, it meant that that House had established a principle that a Minister could by his own sweet will deport anybody convicted under the Bill for a political offence. Personally, he thought <span class="col_3677-3678" refersTo="page_1845"/>the Minister would have been well advised to have dropped that clause out of the Bill at a previous stage. It would have saved a great deal of time, and would have met with a great deal of approval in the country. The inclusion of such a clause now before the House would cause a great deal of suspicion and a great deal of legitimate discontent throughout the country. The Minister had said that he was prepared to take out the words with reference to people born in South Africa, but that if he did so it would still remain impossible to deport anyone who had been born in this country. That being so, the Minister should see the invidious distinction that would be drawn between two sections of the population. Should the House under any circumstances place in the hands of the Government the power to deport people for political offences without first having to come to Parliament for authority&#x003F; In the cases of the recent deportations the Government was not indemnified without an Act of Parliament, but under this Bill power would be given to Government to deport for political offences. He hoped his hon. friend would reconsider the position and would accept as a compromise that before people were deported, judges should recommend that this should be done in the interests of the general peace of the country.

<p>said it would be most unfortunate for this House to drag a Court of Law into such a position that it would, have to express an opinion on the question of deportation. That would be throwing a most odious duty on the Judges. Our Judges had deservedly a high reputation, and if they were called upon to settle such points opportunity would be given for everyone to throw mud at them. The two Judges who held the inquiry into the Rand disturbances had been subjected to a great deal of criticism, and if they were to go further the clause might as well be deleted altogether. (Hear, hear.) It would be putting a most odious onus on Judges which they ought not to exercise, and if he were a judge he would say that the Government should bear the brunt of it and not shelter itself behind the report of the Judges. If he had to choose between accepting the recommendations of Judges and deleting the clause, he would rather do the latter. After all, it was a question of policy which the Government had to carry out and had to defend in this House. He thought Parliament would have a ready way of dealing with any Minister who debased his office by utilising the power given him for the purposes of political consideration. The Minister than moved to amend the amendment by deleting &#x201C;by&#x201D; after &#x201C;herein&#x201D; and substituting &#x201C;before&#x201D; and to omit all the words after &#x201C;eighteen.&#x201D;</p>

<p>said that while the Judges might be put in an invidious position, the Minister was proposing to place himself and the Government in a much more invidious position by arrogating to themselves part of the functions of a judicial body. They would be taking the right to administer additional punishments to those inflicted by the Court If the Minister would not see that deportation was mediæval and should have no place in our law then one had to bow to the majority.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. X. MERRIMAN</person> (Victoria West)</from>

<p>was sorry to hear the Minister of Justice say he could not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort. He (Mr. Merriman) felt, with the very greatest regret, obliged to vote against the Minister whom he had tried to support throughout the Bill, although some of the provisions went rather far. On the whole he was anxious to see the Minister&#x2019;s hands strengthened in the maintenance of law and order, but when they came to a question dealing with the very first principles of freedom he must part company with the Minister. He (Mr. Merriman) had seen too much in this country&#x2014;a great deal which had made him abhor and detest any exercise of arbitrary powers of the sort. He did not like the idea of a special Court, and the giving up of the safeguard of trial by jury. (Hear, hear.) But at any rate this function would be given to a body of men who would be beyond reproach in this country&#x2014;although we should throw on them the invidious task of sentencing for what might be considered political crimes, we had confidence in their judgment. But by the Minister&#x2019;s proposal they said that after a man had served his sentence he went away with a brand upon him and subject to a secondary penalty which could be exercised only by a political officer. The Minister had remarked, &#x201C;Surely no Minister would do such a thing like that.&#x201D; Why, we had seen in this country over and oven again the most arbitrary exercise of powers of this kind. He remembered one night when ten men were taken at Paarl and carried off to a distant part of the country, and when they applied to the court they found it was powerless to grant them justice.</p>

<p>This is Martial Law What is Martial Law except arbitrary power exercised by force&#x003F; We have seen, too much of that kind of thing of what parties will do. (Cheers.) I remember some honest gentlemen on the other side&#x2014;I will not give their names now&#x2014;who said the country would go on well enough if you deport certain gentlemen on this side, including, I think the present Minister of Railways and Harbours. This is the sort of spirit in which Ministers and parties go to work in times of strong feeling. This law is not going to be confined to people who are considered the enemies of human kind&#x2014;it will be used with regard to political people <span class="col_3679-3680" refersTo="page_1846"/>Proceeding, Mr. Merriman said it would be a very grave danger to have a provision like that on the Statute-book. The amendment of his hon. friend introduced a very invidious thing. The whole intention of the Court to be set up would be abhorred by the judges, and if they had the clause standing as it was at present it would make the judges think twice or three times if they convicted a man. It was not right that further punishment should be inflicted at the whim of a Minister. The whole Bill was a distasteful Bill, and though the circumstances of this country called for measures like that, toy all means they should keep within reasonable bounds of justice and not place in the hands of a political officer the right to confer a secondary punishment upon a person who had already been punished by the Courts.</p>

<p>added his voice to the appeal to the Minister to reconsider that matter. They on that side of the House had supported that measure in the interests of the country, and they made that appeal because they felt, as the right hon. gentleman had said, that it was placing in the hands of the political officer the power to inflict punishment upon political opponents. Such power as that had never appeared on the pages of the Statute-book.</p>

<p>said that now they were putting on the Statute-book a principle of law. Proceeding, he said that judges were officials appointed by the State whom they could look on as men of impartiality, men who would not be influenced by political passions. Now they were knocking down the whole of that structure when they allowed a Minister of the Crown to pass sentence. That was the effect of the principle laid down by the hon. Minister. It would create a bad feeling not only among his political opponents but also among a great number of his political friends.</p>

<speech by="#meyler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. MEYLER</person> (Weenen)</from>

<p>said he was glad to be in the same boat as the hon. member for Victoria West on that occasion. It was unnecessary for either of them to come to the House with apologies for their action on the question of deportations. He was sorry the amendment moved by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort had left a loophole through which the Minister was now endeavouring to escape. The amendment which he (Mr. Meyler) moved in the committee stage was very much stronger. Unfortunately there was that loophole in the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment for the Minister, who would accept sub-clause (a), which was of minor importance, and throw out clause (b), which was of vital importance. It would have been far better if they could include all under one heading, as he had set it down in his amendment on the Order Paper. He therefore proposed a further amendment; to add at the end of clause 20 &#x201C;and provided further that no person convicted of a crime mentioned in this section shall be removed from the Union unless he shall have been convicted before a superior court or a special criminal court constituted under section 18 of this Act, and unless such court shall have made a recommendation to the Government in favour of such removal. Any such court shall be and is hereby empowered to make such recommendations.&#x201D; The last clause, he said, was quite essential, for there was nothing in our law which would allow a recommendation to be made. He thought they should have a straight fight on that all-important matter; it was a very far reaching principle which was at stake. They must not overlook the fact that the judge would have all the incidents of the case before him to aid him in deciding whether the additional punishment was merited. He would be in a far better position to judge than anyone else.</p>

<speech by="#sampson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. W. SAMPSON</person> (Commissioner-street)</from>

<p>said he rather favoured the amendment of the hon. member for Weenen in preference to that of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort. He accordingly seconded it. They on the cross-benches had already said how much they were against the principle of any Minister having the power to deport, and they were now asked to put in some safeguard under which deportation could be made. It was a pity that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort had brought his amendment forward in that form. The result, was that the Minister accepted one portion and left the other. It would not do away with the complaint that if the Minister did not think the court had inflicted sufficient penalty on the person he could inflict the further penalty of deportation. If that power was given it should be given to the judges, and when they were sentencing a man after conviction they would take into consideration the whole sentence, and include banishment, if they thought fit to do so; but if the Court had sentenced a man, it would be quite wrong to give the Minister power to inflict a still further punishment. That was against all reason and justice. He regretted that the Minister could accept the first portion of the amendment and refuse the latter part.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. JAGGER</person> (Cape Town, Central)</from>

<p>said that if they had to take a thing they did not like it was well they should <span class="col_3681-3682" refersTo="page_1847"/>have a safeguard. He strongly supported the amendment of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort, or, in the alternative, to delete the clause altogether. It was curious that the Minister should use the argument at the time that they on the Opposition side of the House used when the clause was under discussion. They had pointed out that if they took that matter away from the jury, and left it in the hands of the judges, there would be a certain amount of odium attached to the work. It would lower the standing of the judges in the eyes of the people. They would not get a conviction very easily from the Courts under such circumstances.</p>

<p>He objected to this, first of all, because it was an attack upon liberty. Then there had probably been more feeling aroused over this clause than over any other part of the Bill, for the reason that they felt that a differentiation was drawn between those who were born in the country and those who were born outside the country.</p>

<p>said that, personally, he did not very much mind whether the amendment of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort or the amendment of the hon. member for Weenen was adopted, or the clause was deleted altogether. He very much regretted to see this punishment of banishment introduced into this Bill. It was put in for certain offences and for certain persons of the Union who may have lived for years in the country. That seemed to him a different principle from the principle we already had in the law in regard to prohibited immigrants.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FREMANTLE</person> (continuing)</from>

<speech by="#creswell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. H. P. CRESWELL</person> (Jeppe)</from>

<p>said his only regret was that neither of these amendments went far enough, and that they limited the demand that judges&#x2019; condemnation should be antecedent to deportation to merely the offences mentioned in this Bill. To his view all the offences for which a man was liable to be classed as a prohibited immigrant should only be visited by this punishment of banishment upon the decision of a Court. For his own part he preferred the amendment of the hon. member for Weenen, though he admitted that the amendment of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort, if carried in its entirety, came to the same thing. The important thing was that the power of fixing punishment for any offence should be left to the judicial authority and not to the Executive of the country. He thought the House would agree that it was a dangerous power in the hands of any Government to be able to banish any of its citizens at its own sweet will. If such a sentence were to be pronounced, it should be pronounced from the mouth of a judge, and not from the mouth of a Minister.</p>

<p>hoped the Minister would see his way to accept the proposal. He himself had an amendment dealing with that matter; to put in &#x201C;duly qualified accountant.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The effect of section 8 was that only, when the claim of the Commissioner was held to be unreasonable, or the grounds of appeal there from to be frivolous were costs awarded. That seemed to be a very great hardship. Under this clause a man would have to pay his own costs in the ordinary course, and the Commissioner would have to pay his own costs. He did not think that was fair. He thought from the point of view of the Government and the taxpayer on the one hand and the appellant on the other it was only fair that costs should follow the result.

<p>said that in this section there seemed to be a double attempt at dealing with the period. An attempt was made in sub-section (1) to prescribe a period, and then in sub-section (3) a period of 21 days was mentioned. He thought that 21 days was not a sufficient period, and that 30 days should be substituted. He would suggest to the Minister that they should simply say &#x201C;unless the taxpayer gives notice of such appeal within 30 days,&#x201D; and that they should leave out the first portion of subsection (3).</p>

In regard to the point of the hon. member for Uitenfiage, it was just a question whether the words in sub-section (1) were necessary, but that point might be considered at a later stage.

</speech>

<speech by="#fremantle">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FREMANTLE</person></from>

<p>then moved the deletion of sub-section (2) and the substitution of the following: &#x201C;Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, it shall be lawful for any person domiciled in the Union at any time within three months of the payment of the tax to claim a refund of such portion of the tax paid by a representative taxpayer or payers in respect of the income of such person as exceeds the amount of the tax which would have been payable by such person if his income had been separately assessed; and such portion of the tax shall forthwith be refunded to such person by the Commissioner.&#x201D; The mover said that the principle of collection at the source was an important one, and he was glad the Minister had accepted that principle. But it was not fair, however, that in the case of a rich company which had to pay income tax at the rate of 1s. 6d. in the &#x00A3; that this should be deducted from the amount handed over to the shareholder, no matter how poor he might be For instance, a widow with an income of &#x00A3;200 a year would have to pay income tax amounting to &#x00A3;15 a year if her capital was represented by shares in a rich company, say, the Premier Mine. (Laughter.) On the other hand, a bachelor might be drawing &#x00A3;950 a year from concerns which were not limited, and thus he would escape payment of the income tax altogether. The Minister was rolling in riches, and the House had compelled him to take &#x00A3;40,000 a year more than he wanted to take, so that he could well afford to make the concession. <span class="col_3693-3694" refersTo="page_1853"/>The exemption, however, should be confined to our own people, following on the lines of England, which did not allow exemptions to foreign shareholders. Injustice on a very large scale would be committed if sub-section (2) were allowed to stand in its original form, as follows: &#x201C;If it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the tax has been claimed or paid in respect of any income other than that derived from any share in a company, which by reason of the smallness of the income of the person finally beneficially entitled there to, would be exempt from taxation if it had been included by such person in a return made of his income, the Commissioner may cause the amount of the tax to be refunded as aforesaid.&#x201D; Continuing, Mr. Fremantle urged that the matter be dealt with now, as there would not be another chance of going into this question again for many years to come. The sub-section was taken from the Cape Act of 1904, which was introduced by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth, Central, when he was at his wits&#x2019; end for money. Every man&#x2019;s income should be assessed according to his income, and not according to the income of the company from which he drew his dividends.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. JAGGER</person> (Cape Town, Central)</from>

<p>said that there was no question about it being a matter of justice in that at all. A man might have &#x00A3;300 a year from business or as salary, or from a farm, and he would be exempt, but if he happened to get &#x00A3;300 from a company he had to pay a tax of 1s. 6d. in the &#x00A3; on that. Where was the justice there, 1s. 6d. in the &#x00A3; on a small income of &#x00A3;300, and other people could draw up to &#x00A3;999 and did not have to pay a single penny, if it did not happen to be derived from shares&#x003F; He had with him a list of the shareholders of the Board of Executors here in Cape Town, the balance-sheet and so forth, which showed a profit last year of &#x00A3;17,875. That at 1s. 2d. in the &#x00A3; would amount to about &#x00A3;1,000 which those people would have to pay. There were in that company 120 shareholders holding 180 shares; the majority of the shareholders held one share. The dividend paid was &#x00A3;99 3s., and on that they paid a tax of &#x00A3;5 12s. 6d. Was there any sense of justice there&#x003F; A man might have an income of &#x00A3;999 from anything except shares and he would not have to pay a single sixpence, whereas they had to pay &#x00A3;5 12s. 6d. on less than &#x00A3;100. The difficulty was inherent in the way the Bill was drawn up. The tax was paid at the high rate. The Minister ought to have brought in his Bill in the form the matter was dealt with in the United States, where they had a first tax, and then individuals whose income was more than &#x00A3;1,000 were made to pay an additional tax. He ventured to say that if the amendment of the hon. member for Uitenhage was carried there would have to be a refund to every shareholder.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. OLIVER</person> (Kimberley)</from>

<p>said that when the Minister proposed his income tax Bill he made a statement that it was his intention to tax people only whose income was over &#x00A3;1,000 a year. In his second reading speech he (Mr. Oliver) pointed out that by that Bill the hon. Minister was really taxing people with very small incomes, and not only taxing that income, but taxing it at a very high rate, in some cases at 1s. 6d. a &#x00A3;. He (Mr. Oliver) quoted an illustration, and said that the hon. member for Kimberley need not argue further, he (the Minister) would attend to the poor widow when they came to the committee stage. That promise, which he (the speaker) accepted in good faith, led to his tabling the new sub-section which was printed in the Votes and Proceedings. He agreed, with the hon. member for Uitenhage that the right course was to tax the actual income, and it was quite right there should be a refund of whatever excess had been charged. If the hon. Minister would give him an assurance that he was prepared to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Uitenhage or anything like it, he (Mr. Oliver) would withdraw his amendment, but if not he would move his amendment, because he had the promise over the floor of the House that the Minister would meet the &#x201C;case in the illustration&#x201D; quoted. The hon. member moved a new sub-section 2, to read: &#x201C;Any shareholder in a company, which has paid income tax in respect of its income, shall be entitled on receiving any dividends paid out of such income, to receive a certificate from the company stating the amount of income tax paid by the company applicable to such dividend. On presentation of such certificate to the Commissioner of Taxes, the person named therein shall be entitled to a refund of the income tax shown as applicable to his dividends, if his total income including such dividend does not exceed one thousand pounds.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nathan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. NATHAN</person> (Von Brandis)</from>

<p>said he did not know why the Minister drew distinctions between dividends arising from shares or incomes arising from investments and mortgages, provided the income derived from those sources together was less than &#x00A3;1,000. The object of the Bill was to tax none unless their incomes were over &#x00A3;1,000, and therefore subject to any explanation the hon. Minister might make, the amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town, Central, ought to be accepted. Proceeding, the hon. member said that in lines 40 and 46 of the clause just passed they found the word &#x201C;shall,&#x201D; why then in line 54 should they find the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in other words if it might please the grace of the Government to make refunds to these people &#x003F; He moved in line 54 to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D; and insert &#x201C;shall.&#x201D; He thought the amendment of the hon. member for Uitenhage had some objectionable features, and he would suggest to the Minister that he should accept the amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town, Central.</p>

<p>referred to the case of a widow who had <span class="col_3695-3696" refersTo="page_1854"/>invested all her capital of &#x00A3;300 in a company, from which investment she drew &#x00A3;22 10s. per annum. The widow would have to pay income tax in such a case. Yet the Minister of Finance had definitely promised that he would not tax such small incomes, and the promise ought to be adhered to. He thought the amendment of the hon. member for Uitenhage should be accepted.</p>

<p>said that if the hon. member for Kimberley would look at the section he would see that his point would be entirely met by the deletion of the words &#x201C;other than that derived from any share in a company.&#x201D; In regard to the amendment of the hon. member for Uitenhage, he thought what the hon. member had proposed was really an independent clause. They must first deal with sub-section (2), and then his amendment could follow as a new clause 43. If, as he (the Minister) sincerely hoped, they carried sub-section (2) the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal would go. It really was not possible for him to meet the hon. member on this point. They had heard a great deal during this debate about poor widows and orphans. He was not looking out for the lady at all. (Laughter.) They were dealing with persons, and a company was as much a person in law as any natural person. They had a company and that company had an income of &#x00A3;10,000 or &#x00A3;20,000. They taxed that company. He did not probe into legal mysteries about widows and orphans and other estimable persons. No doubt these people to some extent shared in the &#x00A3;20,000 income of the company and received dividends, etc. He had nothing to do with that. He was satisfied with the income of the company, and he applied the tax on the scale fixed here to the income of that company. If it were hard upon particular individuals, that, of course, was part of the fortunes of war. If this alteration were made then they would have to forego enormous revenue. If the amendment of the hon. member were carried the result would be enormous upon this Bill. There was no doubt that the incomes which would be taxed in the Union would very largely be incomes of companies. That being so, he would urge upon the committee to pass sub-section (2) as it stood, otherwise the whole scheme would be emasculated.</p>

<speech by="#hertzog">

<from>&#x2020;General <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. B. M. HERTZOG</person> (Smith-field)</from>

<p>said he could not follow the Minister&#x2019;s arguments, and believed that after what the Minister had said more members than he thought would vote against the clause. The Minister said he regarded a company as a person, with the result that each one of its shareholders would have to pay on the total profits made by a company. But the basis of the Bill was that everyone was to pay according to his income. If they had a company in which there were 50 investors, whose income was each less than &#x00A3;1,000, the income of the company might be &#x00A3;10,000, and for that reason every investor would have to be taxed as if he had over &#x00A3;1,000. In the future it would, therefore, only pay the rich man to invest in a company. Although a company in law might be regarded as a person, the present Bill was a means of obtaining revenue from persons having a certain income. Why should these certain people then be taxed individually in the manner proposed&#x003F; The proposal certainly was not in accord with the fundamental principle of the Bill. He hoped the Minister would accept the amendments of the hon. member for Cape Town, Central, as otherwise the Bill would affect not the rich man, but the poor man. Only wealthy people would in future invest their money in such companies.</p>

<p>said they had heard of the terrible things that were done by moneylenders and financial sharks, but on the present occasion the Minister of Finance was playing something of a part of one of those moneylenders. He did not think one man in ten had had any idea that by a legal interpretation the Minister would tax persons with incomes below &#x00A3;1,000. If the Minister had put that matter clearly before the House at the time there would have been much more talk about it than there had been.</p>

<p>said that, of course, they might say from one point of view that the Bill was unjust. At the same time he would like to be shown any income tax which was theoretically just. That sort of argument had been heard over and over again. If they accepted the amendment of his hon. friend (Mr. Fremantle) they would strike at the principle of taxing the income at the source. In 1899 they had had exactly the same clause. That was taken over by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Sir E. H. Walton) in 1904, and he was afraid he (Mr. Merriman) had not seen his way to alter it in 1908. But they had had a flat rate of 1s. on the company, and now they were going to make it 1s. 6d. He did not see any way of amending the clause, and he thought the amendments got them deeper into the mud. He was quite prepared to say that they did not want an Income Tax Bill at all, but if they were going to have one, let it be a practical one.</p>

<p>said it might be the case that no income tax was just, but had the right hon. gentleman ever seen an income tax which was more unjust than that one&#x003F; Although they had had the same clause in 1908, there had been a very low exemption. He was astonished at the defence of the Minister, who had said that <span class="col_3697-3698" refersTo="page_1855"/>they could not go past the companies. In Great Britain they did go past the companies and they also did it in the U.S.A. and in Australia. As a matter of fact, a company was an aggregation of citizens. It was not the company that was taxed, it was the shareholders. They taxed the citizens of the State who happened to be shareholders of the company at a very much higher rate than other citizens. The only argument of his hon. friend was the argument he wound up with, that he would have an enormous amount of money to refund. He (Mr. Jagger) moved: In line 50, to omit &#x201C;other than that derived from any share in a company.&#x201D;</p>

<p>said he thought a great deal of misunderstanding had arisen in discussing that matter, and he thought a great deal of false sympathy had been brought in by dragging in widows and poor men. Everybody was in agreement that those large corporations should be made to contribute to the revenue on their incomes. Now they were asked to examine a list of shareholders which constituted the corporation. If people wanted to have the advantages and benefits of the Joint Stock Company Law and wanted to register themselves as a corporation and limit their liability as a corporation, they must be treated in law as a corporate body, and they could not say, &#x201C;do not treat us as a corporation for taxing purposes, but treat us as individuals. &#x201D; A corporation should be dealt with as a &#x201C;persona&#x201D; in law.

<speech by="#oliver">

<p>said the hon. member for Victoria West had said that they could not find an income tax that was perfect. There were income taxes in the world which tried to do what was fair&#x2014;where they taxed people with small incomes they gave a refund. That was the case in Great Britain, and he thought it was a good example for them to follow. Instead of taking the money from people with small incomes of one, two, or three hundred pounds, let them make a graduation over &#x00A3;5,000. Let them tax people who had five or ten thousand a year more heavily rather than place an income tax on persons with small incomes. The Minister had not shown how he was going to carry out the promises he had made to him (Mr. Oliver) during the second reading debate.</p>

<p>said that the Minister in framing the Bill had not given any thought to the circumstances of South Africa, but had picked the measure up from any source he could. He (Mr. Fremantle) was astounded at the speech of the hon. member for Barberton. (Hear, hear.) The Minister took the English principle when it pressed cruelly on the people, but he abstained from taking the English principle when it contained a certain amount of alleviation. There should be an entire recasting of the whole scheme, but as that could not be done they must take away the obvious, glaring, crying injustices. A very large proportion of shareholders in South African companies lived oversea, and they would not be affected by the amendment. There was nothing in the Minister&#x2019;s argument that this would knock the bottom out of his financial scheme.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. X. MERRIMAN</person> (Victoria West)</from>

<p>said his hon. friend (Mr. Fremantle) had talked a great deal about the position of England as a crediting country, but we had our thumbs on the companies who were drawing money out of this country. His hon. friend (Mr. Fremantle) proposed to tax the widow in England, no matter how poor she might be, and then he talked about justice. On, fie! (Laughter.) So it was convenient to tax people oversea, but inconvenient to tax people here&#x2014;because they had votes. He (Mr. Merriman) wished the Minister had not brought in an income tax, but the Minister having done so let them make the Act as good as they could. The income tax was not torture&#x2014;only eighteen pence in the &#x00A3;. (Laughter.)</p>

Under certain circumstances, to take away eighteen pence in the &#x00A3; was a gross injustice. He (Mr. Fremantle) was as much astonished at his hon. friend as his hon. friend (Mr. Merriman) professed to be at him. It was perfectly just to tax an oversea investor whose income we had no means of ascertaining, but the Minister&#x2019;s proposal was a gross injustice.</p>

<speech by="#currey">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. L. CURREY</person> (George)</from>

<p>said that the clause came from the Cape of Good Hope where it was in force from 1904 to 1910, and it was from that Province that the Minister had taken it. In every income tax Bill there were certain hard cases, and that on the face of it was a very hard case, but if the committee agreed to the amendment of the hon. member for Uitenhage then they must go a very great deal further because they must apply the same principle exactly to the profits tax They could not make those exemptions with regard to the income tax and not deal with the profits tax in the same way, and if they dealt in that way with the profits tax on the gold mines arid diamonds, the hon. Minister&#x2019;s revenue was going to disappear, or at any rate a large portion of it. A vast number of shareholders in those companies <span class="col_3699-3700" refersTo="page_1856"/>were small people, and the wealthy shareholders could easily avoid the tax by a pretence o&#x00A3; dividing their shares up amongst their friends and relations, and a great deal of that profits tax, which was counted by millions, would disappear. Therefore the amendment introduced by the hon. member for Uitenhage raised a very important principle, which they were asked to vote upon.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. JAGGER</person> (Cape Town, Central)</from>

<p>said they should not deal with the matter without regard to justice, and simply to get as much as they could. He went on to say that the hon. member for Victoria West criticised taxing the oversea investor and not the local one, but the local man was subject to very heavy taxation through the Customs which the oversea investor did not pay.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person></from>

<p>moved, in line 67, after &#x201C;town board &#x201D;, to insert &#x201C;local board&#x201D;, and in line 68, after &#x201C;school board &#x201D;, to insert &#x201C;district councils, the Transkei General Council, and the Pondoland General Council &#x201D;.</p>

<p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>

<p>The clause, as amended, was adopted.</p>

<p>On clause 4, Levy of income tax and the rate thereof.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#walton">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. H. WALTON</person> (Port Elizabeth, Central)</from>

<p>moved the omission of the following words from sub-section 5: And income received or accrued by virtue of any contract for the sale of goods in the Union, whether such goods have been delivered or are to be delivered in or out of the Union, arid income received or accrued from any service rendered or work or labour done in the carrying on in the Union of any business, trade, profession or occupation, whether the payment for such services, or work or labour is made, or is to be made, by a person resident in or out of the Union, and wherever payment for such <span class="col_3705-3706" refersTo="page_1859"/>services or work or labour is made or is to be made, shall be deemed to be income received or accrued from sources within the Union.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person></from>

<p>said the words were necessary and were taken from the Act of 1908.</p>

<p>The amendment was negatived.</p>

<p>An amendment which had been previously moved by Mr. Fremantle was withdrawn.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person></from>

<p>said that the hon. member for Uitenhage wanted to avoid the Bill being made up of one amendment after another, so finally they came together to discuss the matter and with his assistance they had framed a new sub-section 6. As sub-section 6 stood the farmer who wished to depart from the ordinary returns going simply on profits and losses had to give notice to that effect, so that he could go on the new system. The hon. member for Uitenhage had persuaded him (the Minister) to cross the policy with regard to the two alternatives so as to make the notice apply to the other choice; so that unless a notice was given by the farmer he would pay on purchases and sales but he could give a notice to pay income tax on the increases or decrease of stock reckoned at the end of the year. It did not make much difference. A form Would be sent to the farmer, on which there would be a notification that he had his choice whether to pay income tax on increase or decrease of stock as at the beginning of the year as compared with the end of the year, or pay income tax on purchases and sales, the only condition being that he must not jump from one to the other in following years. He moved the new sub-section, putting the matter in that form, which simply turned round the choice but otherwise made no alteration. It read as follows: (6) In assessing the income of a person carrying on pastoral, agricultural or other farming operations, the Commissioner, subject to the proviso hereto, shall not take into account the value of such person&#x2019;s livestock or agricultural produce not disposed of by him at the beginning and end of the year of assessment: Provided that if any such person desires that such value shall be taken into account in the assessment of his income he shall, when furnishing his return under section 17 of this Act, give notice in writing to that effect signed by him or by his agent. Every such notice shall be irrevocable by such person, and in assessing the income of such person the Commissioner shall take into account the value of such person&#x2019;s livestock and agricultural produce not disposed of at the beginning and end of the year of assessment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#watkins">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. H. WATKINS</person> (Barkly)</from>

<p>did not see why the matter should be made irrevocable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person></from>

<p>said the notice was given to the farmer, so that he would not lightly make his choice and so that he would know that he would be bound afterwards.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#walton">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. H. WALTON</person> (Port Elizabeth, Central)</from>

<p>said it was impossible for a highly involved clause of that kind to be properly discussed by them after simply being read out.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. JAGGER</person> (Cape Town, Central)</from>

<p>asked if it was quite fair to the farmers themselves. In the first place they would have been inclined to take the option not to take account of their stock. If it had stood as at first, the farmers would have taken the first course, the difference between the increase and decrease, of their stock, but how as the other&#x2019; course was put first they would take that option.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person></from>

<p>said he did not think it would have that effect. The farmers would have before them the form. He had noticed that he must make up his mind on which basis he should be taxed. There would practically be no difference.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_riet">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. W. VAN DER RIET</person> (Albany)</from>

<p>thought it should not be irrevocable. The section did not say it was binding on future years., If a man did not sell anything for three years he would be taxed on the third year&#x2019;s income, possibly on a much higher scale.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fremantle">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. S. FREMANTLE</person> (Uitenhage)</from>

<p>said the fact that a man had to put an increase on the stock which had not been sold was felt to be a hardship, and was a great hardship. He was glad that the Minister gave the choice to people that they should not do that, unless they deliberately elected to do it</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fichardt">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. G. FICHARDT</person> (Ladybrand)</from>

<p>said that the difficulty he saw was the irrevocability of it. If a man had chosen one alternative was there no possible arrangement to be made under the Bill to enable him to change to the other system if he altered the character of his farming&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fremantle">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FREMANTLE</person></from>

<p>said it seemed to him that this all depended upon the Bill of next year. He was sorry that the Minister had not replied to his hon. friend.</p>

<p>It was agreed to omit sub-section (6) as printed.</p>

<p>The new sub-section as moved by the Minister of Finance was agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 4, as amended, was agreed to.</p>

<p>On clause 14, Deductions from taxable amount,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. JAGGER</person> (Cape Town, Central)</from>

<p>moved in lines 41 and 45 to insert &#x201C;buildings&#x201D; before &#x201C;machinery,&#x201D; and to delete the proviso at the end of the subsection.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fremantle">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. S. FREMANTLE</person> (Uitenhage)</from>

<p>moved to report progress; and ask leave to sit again. He said that this clause would <span class="col_3707-3708" refersTo="page_1860"/>take some time, and he hoped the Minister would agree to report progress at this stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person></from>

<p>intimated that he would raise no objection to the motion</p>

<p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

<p>Progress was reported and leave obtained to resume to-morrow (Tuesday).</p>
