<heading>PORTRAITS OF MESSRS. SAUER AND FISCHER.</heading>

<p>The CLERK read the following letter, dated the 7th July, from the Prime Minister, on behalf of a committee of members of both Houses of Parliament:</p>

<p>&#x201C;On behalf of the committee of members of both Houses of Parliament I have the honour to request your acceptance of portraits of the late Hon. J. W. Sauer and the late Right Hon. Abraham Fischer, and to express the hope that you will accord them a suitable place in the gallery of South African worthies who already find a place on the walls of the Houses of Parliament.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. W. SMARTT</person> (Fort Beaufort)</from>

<p>said he wished to ask the Prime Minister a question. Hon. members knew that the House would be proroguing that afternoon, and they would be going away to their homes. Many of them were making arrangements, and it was necessary for them to know whether there was to be any alteration with regard to the time of holding the next session. There were rumours that it was the intention of the Government to hold a session in November. If such were the case it would be only fair to the members, some of whom might be going to Europe or making other arrangements, that the Prime Minister should take the House into his confidence as to whether it was the intention of the Government to hold a session in November as had been freely rumoured.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>&#x2020; The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person></from>

<p>replied that it was very difficult for him at this stage to say exactly when Parliament would meet again. He could state, however, that there was no intention on the part of the Government to have any sitting in November, but, of course, the whole question depended on circumstances which might arise and which might render it necessary for Parliament to meet. However, it was in the mind of the Government at a future date to alter the whole period of session, because it had been pointed out by a number of hon. members that the winter sittings were not convenient. In these circumstances the Government might consider the advisability of reverting to the old system under which Parliament met in October, adjourned for a while in December, and then met again in January or February, so that the prorogation could take place in April. He wished to emphasise, however, that there was no decision as yet as to meeting in November this year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. W. SMARTT</person> (Fort Beaufort)</from>

<p>said he understood from the Prime Minister that there was no intention that that Parliament should meet in November, but should anything arise to cause such a session he presumed the Prime Minister would give the country sufficient notice, because the ordinary six weeks or a month would not be sufficient if hon. members had made other arrangements. He took it that the right hon. gentleman would give them such notice.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I have seen the papers in the case referred to, and Miss Davies has had numerous interviews with the Secretary for Justice.

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person></from>

<p>moved the third reading of the Industrial Disputes and Labour Bureaux Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fawcus">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FAWCUS</person> (Umlazi)</from>

<p>said he wished to make his position clear in connection with that matter. That Bill had been referred to a Select Committee and after being returned from the Select Committee it was opposed by hon. members on the cross-benches and other members in the House. Then they suddenly found that the Socialist opposition to the Bill was lulled to sleep in a most suspicious manner, after two-thirds of the House had gone. He was informed that that had been done without consultation with members of the Select Committee. He did not consider that that was a proper way to treat Select Committees appointed by that House. The Bill had been re-introduced when half of the members were gone, and the other half were so worn out and tired that they were prepared to pass anything put before them. One well knew that the Opposition were not in a position to oppose that Bill. They had called for remedial legislation and they had got it. He (Mr. Fawcus), in common with the cross-benches, had opposed that Bill, and he had consistently opposed all industrial legislation that session. He thought the Bill was hasty, ill considered, and panic-stricken legislation, and he thought the House should take that opportunity to refuse the third reading, and give them another year in which to recover themselves. They had a providential instance which had just happened in England, the dispute at the Woolwich Arsenal in which 12,000 men had been thrown out of work because one man would not work alongside a non-Trade Unionist. If the Minister was prepared to introduce that sort of thing he hoped the House would not agree with him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#creswell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. H. P. CRESWELL</person> (Jeppe)</from>

<p>said that when that Bill was introduced the cross-benches opposed the second reading because it contained a number of provisions which conflicted with what they thought to be the right line of procedure. The Ministry Had very wisely recognised the force of the arguments used, and had wisely decided that the direction in which they should go was in providing the means by which both sides might meet on common grounds, and that that was the safest way. The hon. member for Umlazi had alluded to the Woolwich affair, but he had failed to see the real significance of what was taking place&#x2014;that it was becoming universally recognised, for <span class="col_4297-4298" refersTo="page_2155"/>the protection of the wage-earners, that they could not tolerate free labour. He did not hold the view that any legislation would prevent strikes, but he thought the wisest course would have been, though he knew it would not have passed the House, to have laid down that no blackleg labour should be employed until masters and men had settled their dispute. He was glad the Government had dropped provisions that had not proved successful in other countries.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. DUNCAN</person> (Fordsburg)</from>

<p>said he hoped that members inside and people outside the House would not be alarmed by what the hon. member for Umlazi had said. The hon. member seemed to have been alarmed at the change of front on behalf of the Government. To say that the Bill would cause disputes was to mislead the House; disputes existed, and that was why the Bill had been introduced. He was sorry the Industrial Disputes Act of the Transvaal had been dropped, for though it had failed in one or two cases, a Board was recently appointed, and had succeeded in settling a dispute. He believed that in time that Act would have gained the confidence of both sides of the House. Though he agreed with the Bill, he was in favour of something on the lines of the Canadian Act being introduced. He hoped that the Bill would be given a fair trial, and that the supporters of the cross-benches, on the one side, and the employers on the other, would take advantage of the measure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#haggar">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. H. HAGGAR</person> (Roodepoort)</from>

<p>said that they on the cross-benches would do all they could in the interests of peace by removing conditions which brought about disturbance and war. They accepted the Bill because it was a confession on the part of the Minister that he was wrong at the start. He thought that the Minister and his colleague ought to join the Labour Party as soon as they could do so without shame.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN NIEKERK</person> (Boshof)</from>

<p>said that after the various stages through which this Bill had gone it should have been removed, as only the skeleton was left. It was not right to bring a measure of the importance of this Bill before such an attenuated House in such an attenuated form. Whenever the hon. member for Roodepoort gave his support to a proposal his (the speaker&#x2019;s) suspicions were aroused, because no good could come from Nazareth. The Government already had the Peace Preservation Act to deal with disturbances, and he did not, in the circumstances, see why the House should be asked to place another Act of this nature on the Statute-book. He moved that the Bill be read a third time that day three months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#keyter">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. KEYTER</person> (Ficksburg)</from>

<p>seconded the amendment as a protest against the action of the Government in proceeding with insignificant legislation while important measures had to stand down.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#andrews">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. ANDREWS</person> (George Town)</from>

<p>said that they on the cross-benches were always anxious to meet their employers and talk over matters. It had always been the case that the employers flatly refused to meet anyone, but what they called their own employees.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. F. W. STRUBEN</person> (Newlands)</from>

<p>said the hon. members for Boshof and Ficksburg would like this House to believe that the attempts to bring employers and employees into friendly relations to settle disputes were of no importance, and that this Bill should not now be proceeded with, whereas other measures, such as the matter of putting natives under very severe restrictions, should be gone on with as matters of great importance to this country. He did not agree with the hon. members. He could not help saying, however, that he thought the Government in the attitude they had taken up on this Bill, were simply going on with it to save their faces. The hon. member went on to claim that it was on account of the insistent attitude of hon. members on the Opposition benches that the Government had been forced to introduce this session industrial and kindred legislation. He thought that the voluntary conciliation principle would enable disputes to be settled in a far better way than they had been up to the present. In the meantime, he would ask hon. members on the cross-benches to consider the trade returns how before the country, which showed the effect upon this country of the sort of thing that was brought about by the ill-considered and dangerous conduct of some of the hon. members&#x2019; colleagues.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#madeley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. B. MADELEY</person> (Springs)</from>

<p>said he hoped the hon. member would draw the attention of his own colleagues to the trade returns and point out to them the moral of their conduct in endeavouring to precipitate industrial war in this country. The hon. member and his friends could take whatever comfort they liked from the industrial legislation proposed this session, and they might draw the attention of the country to the industrial legislation which had been passed, but, unfortunately for him and his friends and also for the Government, he (Mr. Madeley) was very much afraid that, while they were drawing the attention of the Government to these particular matters, unwittingly perhaps the eyes of the country would stray to the Indemnity Bill and other legislation passed this session. He would ask the hon. member for Boshof and others to withdraw their opposition to this Bill, because it established the principle of the Parliament of the country recognising the advantages of conciliation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#merriman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. X. MERRIMAN</person> (Victoria West)</from>

<p>said he could not help expressing what he might call disgust at the nauseous kind of competition there was for what was called the Labour vote. The hon. member for Newlands jumped up and said that &#x201C;Codlin&#x2019;s the friend, not Short.&#x201D; As for <span class="col_4299-4300" refersTo="page_2156"/>Short, he had simply taken off his coat and handed it over to them completely. (Laughter.) He did not wonder that these people who had had the victory all along the line were now chuckling over it. Now that the session was practically at an end, he could not understand why they should try to run a Bill of this kind through. There were clauses in the Bill about the prosecution of Trade Unions. He thought the chief recommendation of the Bill was that it was a Bill in which gentlemen were to come together at a round table and talk the matter over. Now he found there was a clause about prosecutions and penalties which had evidently crept into the Bill.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I will explain that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MERRIMAN</person>:</from>

<p>You will have to explain a long while before you convince me, because I don&#x2019;t want to be convinced&#x2014; (&#x201C;Hear, hear,&#x201D; and laughter)&#x2014;and I can use my own poor wits to know what the result of this legislation is going to be in this country. If I wanted to tell you what the object of this Bill is and why it is so popular, it is because it is aimed at the coloured people. (Dissent.)</p>

<p>I say it is an unfair thing. It is a Bill which deals with the workers of the whole country and you leave out five-sixths of them, and they will be handed over to the tender mercies of the remaining sixth.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person></from>

<p>said he hoped that they would come to a vote about this matter. A man who took up the attitude of the right hon. gentleman was not open to argument. He was hostile to the Bill, to the manner of introducing it, and to anything which aimed for industrial peace in this country. There was only one point he (the Minister) wanted to make clear. They discussed the matter in Select Committee, and did not come to an agreement, and it was perfectly plain to anybody who read the report of that committee that there was going to be a good deal of opposition in this House. They set down one day for the committee stage. Unfortunately, the greater part of the day was taken up with a discussion on the financial relations of the Provincial Council, and this continued until late in the afternoon. It was perfectly plain that they must either abandon the whole Bill or carry the portion that had been passed. That portion was worth having, and the remainder could be dealt with next session.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sampson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. W. SAMPSON</person> (Commissioner-street)</from>

<p>regretted very much the words that had fallen from the right hon. gentleman. It was not so much the wording of the Bill, but the spirit in which Parliament sent it forth, that would do good. It would start a new system in this country, but certain hon. members, without any reasonable objection, were opposing the measure. He was still at a loss to know what the objection was The right hon. gentleman was wrong, and was trying to create a schism between white and coloured. He (Mr. Sampson) was president of a society which had a large number of coloured people in it. The right hon. gentleman was the person who was stirring up differences between white people and coloured people; he was the biggest enemy of industrial peace in this country. (Labour cheers.) All through the recent troubles on the Rand he was speaking at Stellenbosch, and when these speeches were read in Johannesburg, they created considerable feeling. He was no good either to the workmen or to the employers.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Niekerk&#x2019;s amendment was negatived.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. BAXTER</person> (Cape Town. Gardens)</from>

<p>said that paragraph 36 of the fourth report of the committee stated that nearly &#x00A3;3,000 was spent on rates on the Groote Schuur Estate, but the City Treasurer had supplied him with figures showing that the rates paid by the Union Government on Groote Schuur Estate in 1913 amounted to &#x00A3;1,104, and in 1914 to &#x00A3;1,023. this being on a valuation of &#x00A3;68,000.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. DE JAGER</person> (Paarl)</from>

<p>moved as an amendment, &#x201C;with the exception of clause 29.&#x201D; This clause, he said, recommended that Government should make a more serious attempt to realise the brandy stock, but he was of opinion that the present arrangement should not be disturbed. The brandy market was not in a flourishing condition, the price being very low, and for Government to go into the market with this brandy would be a calamity of the worst possible kind.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. JAGGER</person> (Capo Town. Central)</from>

<p>said, according to the figures in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, the amount paid by rates by Government on the Grooto <span class="col_4301-4302" refersTo="page_2157"/>Schuur Estate, inclusive of sanitary and water fees, was &#x00A3;2,950. The estate was very largely used for the purposes of recreation by inhabitants of the Peninsula, and it was only fair that the country should not be saddled with rates on that portion of the estate. There must be some misunderstanding as to the actual amount paid in rates. He hoped the House would not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Paarl. The country was spending on the Brandy Board alone something over &#x00A3;2,000 a year, and it was carrying a million gallons of brandy. The price of brandy for the last two years had been high, but the Board had taken no steps to get rid of the stock. It was the idea of one of the members of the Board that more vigorous steps should be taken, and that if that was done they could realise even more than they did at present. The report was merely a reference to the Government, and they now only urged the Government to take more vigorous steps to realise some of the assets.</p>

<heading>THE SOUTH AFRICA ACT.</heading>

<p>The report of the Select Committee on the amendment of the South Africa Act was considered.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020; The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person></from>

<p>said the Select Committee had gone at some length into the question of the amendment of the preamble of the South Africa Act so that the name of Providence might be acknowledged in the preamble. A serious legal question had arisen on this matter. Parliament could amend the Constitution, but the question was whether the preamble could be amended. The amendment of the preamble was of course, an altogether different matter, and the Select Committee had considered that the preamble in reality did not form part of the Constitution. They had taken evidence and gone into the question whether the National Convention had left the name of Providence Out of the preamble purposely, and they had been given to understand that the Convention had left this part out after due and careful consideration. What the reasons were which led to the omission could not be stated because, of course, the discussions at the Convention were secret. Of course, they could pass a law providing for the recognition of the Almighty in the South Africa Act, but if they did so they would practically say that in the past Parliament had not recognised the guidance of the Almighty. This he, for one, was not prepared to admit, because it was clear from all the proceedings in this House that in everything the guidance of the Lord was recognised. The Speech from the Throne always made mention of the guidance of Providence, and the sittings of Parliament were daily opened with prayer; in addition to which members had to take oath of fidelity in which occurred the words: &#x201C;So help me God.&#x201D; There were many people who fully sympathised and felt that the name of Providence should be acknowledged in the Constitution. But at the same time he wished to say that there were many people also who used this matter for political purposes. A number of people had informed him that if Parliament accepted this report they would be quite satisfied. He wished to point out that the hon. member for Edenburg did not agree with the findings of the Committee, but wished to introduce words explicitly acknowledging the guidance of God. The Prime Minister and himself had discussed the matter with the Federal Council of Churches, and having been told that in all proclamations and other State documents the guidance of the Almighty was recognised, that body had expressed themselves satisfied. He trusted the report would be accepted, and he moved accordingly that it be adopted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. N. GROBLER</person> (Edenburg)</from>

<p>said the Select Committee had taken careful evidence and legal opinion, and had come to the conclusion that the preamble could not be amended without reference to the Imperial Government. But he (the speaker) and others who formed the minority on the Select Committee held that even if that had to be done, it should be done, because the Imperial Government would not refuse. But, furthermore, clause 158 made it clear that Parliament could amend the Constitution. But the committee had not been prepared to amend the Constitution, holding that the guidance of the Almighty was recognised by Parliament daily commencing its proceedings with prayer. Even if the guidance of the Lord had to be recognised in every law passed by this House, he would be in favour of such being done. It had been said that the use of phraseology of this kind had fallen out of fashion in other countries, but on inquiring it appeared that countries such as Russia, Mexico, Switzerland, Australia, and a number of the American States had it in their Constitution. It appeared to him that it was because Australia had this in its Constitution that members of the Select Committee had objected to have it in the South African Constitution. Yet they continually took examples from Australia in <span class="col_4303-4304" refersTo="page_2158"/>material respects. In spiritual respects, however, they refused to accept that example. Australia, he wished to say, had originally not had these words in its Constitution, but after great trouble it had succeeded in getting the words inserted. Was Australia any worse for it? He claimed that these words should be inserted, because the history of the people of South Africa, the descendants of the old Huguenots, was a great one, and the people were a religious people. The Church was a great power in South Africa, and every denomination wished to see these words inserted. The Dutch Reformed Church had taken the lead, and at its Synod had come to a unanimous decision. The Congress of the Churches at Durban were also in favour of the same thing being done. A strong agitation had been started by the Synod Commission, which had some time ago, presented a petition to this House. That Commission was a governing body like the Government of the country, and unless something were done a strong, never-ending agitation would be set on foot. If the Government persisted in the attitude it had now assumed he feared the refusal to alter the Constitution would be the straw which would break the camel&#x2019;s back. He held that the Select Committee had not been instructed to go into the desirability of inserting these words, but to discover how best to insert these words in the Constitution. He would therefore move to omit all the words after &#x201C;that&#x201D; for the purpose of inserting &#x201C;section one of the South Africa Act, 1909, be amended by inserting after &#x201C;this Act&#x201D; the following words, &#x201C;in which the guidance of Almighty God in the affairs of the Union is acknowledged.&#x201D;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. DUNCAN</person> (Fordsburg),</from>

<p>who seconded the original motion, said he did not know that either the dignity of this House or the feelings which prompted hon. members to move for this Select Committee would be well served by a long, protracted debate. (Hear, hear.) He very much regretted that his late hon. friend, the member for Durban, Central (Sir David Hunter) was not here to take part in this debate. He (Mr. Duncan) did not attach very much importance to the legal difficulties which were so clearly set out by the Minister in his speech. The legal difficulty was whether it was competent for this Parliament to amend the preamble to the Act of Union or whether any amendment to the preamble would have to be carried out by the Imperial Parliament. Personally, he had little doubt that, if this House desired that such an amendment should be made, the Imperial Parliament would be quite willing to act in the matter What they had to consider was whether it was in the interests of South Africa and in the interests of religion and good feeling that such an amendment should be made. He fully agreed with the conclusion to which the Select Committee came.</p>

<p>After all, what the hon. member for Edenburg founded his speech upon was that a reference to the guidance of the Almighty had been omitted in the framing of the Constitution. That was a fact. It was done not carelessly but deliberately, after consideration. Rightly or wrongly it was done, and nothing they could do now could alter the fact. He thought the hon. member for Edenburg was wrong when he said that after the Australia Constitution was passed into law an amendment was made in it by the wish of the people. An amendment was made before the Act making the Constitution in Australia law was passed. At one of the meetings held in Australia to consider the draft Constitution that amendment was made. Why did not the hon. member move here before the draft Constitution had been passed? Our Constitution stood as it was passed by the National Convention, and nothing they could do now would alter that. What they could do now, and the only thing they could do now was solemnly to pass an Act declaring that they recognised the guidance of Almighty God in their deliberations. Was it desirable that they should do that? Were there not very much better ways, more effective ways, more reverent ways of acknowledging the guidance of the Almighty God in their deliberations, than by passing an Act solemnly declaring that they did recognise that guidance? When Parliament was opened reference was made to the guidance of the Almighty, and also at the opening of the proceedings of the House each day. Such guidance was best recognised by their conduct. (Hear, hear.) He hoped the hon. member for Edenburg would drop his amendment and that the report of this committee, which he could assure hon. members received much consideration and careful consideration, would be adopted by this House.</p>

<p>said the fact that the Almighty&#x2019;s name was not recognised in the Act of Union was regarded by the people as a blot on that Constitution, and he held that it was the duty of this House to see to it that the words proposed by the hon. member for Edenburg were inserted. Posterity would honour the hon. member for his speech and for his attitude on this great subject. The speaker was not concerned with the motive which guided the National Convention to its decision. Perhaps it was one of the reasons which prevented the right hon. member for Victoria West from serving on the Select Committee.</p>

<p>I should not like it to be thought that I wished to treat the question raised by the hon. member for Edenburg with any idea of levity. The matter was moved by my hon. friend there (Mr. Malan) in the Convention, and I opposed it for this reason, because I said it seemed to me a mockery to use the name of the Almighty in connection <span class="col_4305-4306" refersTo="page_2159"/>with this Constitution, which disobeys one of the primary doctrines of our faith, which is that all men are equal, and that we should not place invidious disabilities upon any class of human beings. I said it seemed to me a mockery to use the name of God in connection with a Constitution that does that. My hon. friend behind me has reminded us that the Constitution of Mexico contained the name of the Almighty. What an example! It would be better, I think, if some of us read the 57th chapter of Isaiah, which describes the proper way of observing our duty That is to do justice and mercy. That is the way, and not by mere words. Isaiah was addressing the Jewish nation, which thought that by observing words and forms it was honouring God. I deplore, sometimes, some of the actions we are drawn into in this House, but, of course, &#x201C;Judge not that ye be not judged.&#x201D; But let me tell my hon. friend, you may put the name of God into every line of the Constitution, but &#x201C;Be not deceived, God is not mocked. As a man soweth so shall he reap.&#x201D; (Cheers.) As we sow, so shall we reap, and it is not by any form of words we shall get away from the consequences of our actions. (Cheers.)</p>

The Government could enter into negotiations with the Imperial Government and so get the desired amendment passed. He supported the amendment.</p>

<p>said the question was a most delicate one, on which everyone should vote as his conscience dictated. He thought the difficulties in the way of the insertion of the words referred to were but slight. The name of the Almighty, at the request of the people, was inserted in the Constitution of the South African Party, and should also appear in the South Africa Act. Nobody had shown that it was impossible to get that done, and he intended to support the amendment.</p>

<p>said he had acted as one of the representatives from the Church to ask the Government to have the words proposed by the hon. member for Edenburg inserted in the Act of Union. At that time, however, he had not realised the difficulties connected with the insertion of these words. He quite realised the many obstacles in the way, and he thought the Church also realised these difficulties. The Church Council had expressed itself satisfied if the report of the Select Committee was accepted. He felt proud to be a member of a Parliament which daily opened its proceedings with prayer, and he thought the Church would see that no good purpose would be served by pressing the matter further at this stage. The hon. member for Edenburg would not be rendering a service to the people if he still pressed his amendment. It would be very much better to give effect to God&#x2019;s will rather than to talk about it. The leaders of the Church were satisfied with the report.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>&#x2020; The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person></from>

<p>said he had attentively listened to the various speeches. He felt disappointed that the hon. member for Edenburg had introduced an amendment on a delicate matter like this. The question had been carefully discussed by the Convention, and after the most careful consideration, the Convention had come to certain conclusions. He did not think that the example of Australia had anything to do with this question. When the Constitution was being drawn up in Australia, an agitation was started among the public, with the result that the recognition of the name of the Lord was in the Preamble when the Constitution went to England. In South Africa the Constitution, before it was sent to England, each of the different Provinces had had an opportunity of starting an agitation. The Convention deliberately left the words out and the four Colonies afterwards approved of the draft Act. He agreed with the Minister of Justice that the introduction of a special law to make provision for this question would give the impression as if in the pass the name of the Almighty had never been recognised. He, for one, refused to throw that slur on his forefathers, the forefathers of members of this House who had been famous for their religious sentiment. In the Constitutions of none of the Provinces would they find the name of the Almighty recognised, and he held the question should not be re-opened now. He had no objection to the voting which took place at the National Convention on the subject being published. They were a religious people, and recognised the Divine guidance in every respect. The representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church had met him, and had expressed themselves satisfied if the report of the Select Committee was accepted. He therefore appealed to hon. members not to start making this a political question, and not go to the country on a delicate question like this. He felt grateful at the attitude adopted by the Church, but seeing the many difficulties which already did exist, he trusted that members would not indulge in the unedifying spectacle of raising this question in the country. It would be much better to take up the same attitude as had been adopted by the Church.</p>

<p>resuming the debate on the report of the Select Committee on the proposed amendment of the South Africa Act, said he was unable to be silent on such a subject. The question under debate was one of the utmost importance to those members who were descendants from the old Huguenots, who were a pious people with great traditions. He could not understand the attitude of the hon. member for Vrededorp, and wished to ask him whether the decision of the Church Council could make him change his strong convictions? Was the hon. member a Roman Catholic? He thought the House should be able to arrive at a conclusion, and in the circumstances he would move the following motion: &#x201C;This House, recognising the guidance of the Almighty, as stated in the report, adopts the said report.&#x201D;</p>

<p>seconded the amendment, and said it was not according to their speeches that they would be judged, but according to their actions. The serious religious sentiments of their forefathers were known to everyone, and were they now going to throw a slur on their forefathers by inserting a provision in the Constitution giving the impression that they considered their forefathers had not recognised the guidance of the Almighty? Did they want to make themselves appear to be more pious than their forefathers? The Church Council, which had sent in the petition, were satisfied with the report, and he (the speaker) felt he could be no less. He hoped that posterity would not be able to say of them that they attached more value to forms than to the things themselves.</p>

<speech by="#serfontein">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. P. SERFONTEIN</person> (Kroonstad)</from>

<p>said the subject was one which touched the tender est susceptibilities of the public, not only of the Dutch-speaking section but also of those who spoke English as well. The public felt very strongly on the subject, and he hoped that the House would be able to meet their wishes on the subject, but now he saw that some of their most prominent men would not listen to the voice of the people. It had been alleged by their opponents that a portion of the public would be injured, that the Constitution would be torn away from its context, and so on, but all that had nothing to do with the question. To the wish of the general public, the vast majority of them at any rate, it was their duty to listen. He applauded the attitude which had been taken up at the National Convention by Colonol Greene, and his name would certainly be held in honour by the people. Reference had been made to the fact that the Church Council were resigned to accepting the report which had been brought up by the Select Committee, but he felt certain if the opinions of the congregations were obtained the vast majority of them would be in favour of acknowledging the guidance of Providence, and they would say that such should be contained in the Act of Constitution. Religion was the true characteristic of all civilisation, and it was proper that the name of the Almighty should be recognised. The Minister of Justice had drawn their attention to technical difficulties which stood in the way of an amendment of the Constitution, but where there was a will there was a way. They had also been reminded that there was no such recognition in the Constitution of the late Transvaal, Free State. Natal and Cape Colonies, but that merely proved that the persons who drew up those documents, like the members of the National Convention, were fallible men. Because a mistake was made by them was no reason in the world why the error should be perpetuated. If they had made ninety blunders in the past, it did not follow that they ought to make a hundred.</p>

<speech by="#louw">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. A. LOUW</person> (Colesberg)</from>

<p>pointed out that the Select Committee had gone into the whole matter, and whilst its members held different views they had only one purpose, and that was to have a thorough inquiry into the question. They all desired to fill in the hiatus in the Constitution. He himself had desired the same thing, but the deeper he went into the question the more he became convinced that even if it were possible, it was not now desirable to amend the Constitution. The Committee had not received an instruction to amend, but merely to inquire. They did that, and they came to the conclusion that amendment was not desirable. There were technical difficulties in the way which had been explained by the Minister of Justice. If amendment were possible it would be by means of an amending Bill. The Constitution would continue in existence, and it would always be visible afterwards that it had been added to. When the South Africa Act was under consideration there had been no agitation amongst the public concerning the recognition of the guidance of God to ask that it be comprised in that document. If such an agitation had been provoked it would certainly have resulted in a change being made in the terms of the draft Act. It was not necessary for the hon. member for Ficksburg to say that he did not wish to make a political question of the matter. No one did. If they did such a thing it would be sacrilege. They should follow the advice of the hon. member for Fordsburg, and recognise the guidance of God in their own deeds and actions. Talking there in that House signified nothing, or at any rate very little. The Church Council was satisfied to accept the report, and if the motion of the hon. member for Beaufort West were unanimously accepted, the country as a whole could not be otherwise than satisfied also. The Church would be satisfied.</p>

<p>said the Select Committee had been guided by the report of the National Convention, <span class="col_4309-4310" refersTo="page_2161"/>showing that the question had been considered and that the omission had been deliberate. From clause 5 of that report it seemed clear that the Select Committee had been mainly influenced by the work of the National Convention. He gladly admitted that the work of that Convention had been a great work, but that did not preclude the possibility that they had made errors. He denied that it was with him and others any question of politics, but rather a question which concerned the public and one in which they felt deeply interested If their predecessors had made a mistake in drafting their Constitutions, it seemed to him that the present generation ought to learn from these mistakes. They had been told that it was impossible to get an amendment in the preamble of the Act, but on that point he wished to refer to the evidence of Mr. Matthews. who had been before the Select Committee and who had suggested the phraseology in which such an amendment could be clothed. The speaker concluded by saying that he felt obliged to the hon. member for Edenburg for his calm speech and for the amendment which he had proposed. He could not vote for the amendment which had been proposed by the hon. member for Beaufort West, because it contained something which did not appear in the report. He did not wish to see the House divide on the question, and trusted that some way out of the difficulty would be found.</p>

<p>who seconded the amendment which had been moved by Dr. Neethling, said that, as a member of the National Convention he deplored the omission from the South Africa Act of a recognition of the guidance of God. Still, that had been done, and he begged hon. members not to try to change an accomplished fact which could no longer be changed. The National Convention had done it, and in all the length of days that fact would remain unchanged. The National Convention had now ceased to exist, and it was quite impossible to change the work that it had done. It was not desirable to divide on the question, and it would be preferable to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Beaufort West. In clause 5 of the report there was a clear recognition of the guidance of God. If the report of the Select Committee were agreed to it would be equivalent to saying that they would have preferred it if the National Convention had included the words in the preamble of the Act. If they adopted the amendment of the hon. member for Edenburg they would not amend the error. By adopting the report itself they would amend the error in part, and that would be in the interests of the whole people.</p>
