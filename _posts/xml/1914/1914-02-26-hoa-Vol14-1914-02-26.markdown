<speech by="#mentz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MENTZ</person> (Zoutpansberg)</from>

<p>said he wished to refer to a letter which appeared in the &#x201C;Cape Times&#x201D; of that morning, signed Henry C. Nefdt, of Lytton-street, Observatory. He did so, not only because of that letter, but in view of the extremely derogatory remarks made in the Press by individuals and also by the Press itself. The letter was as follows:</p>

<p>&#x201C;Sir Jas. Molteno, as Speaker of the House, is supposed to be impartial to both sides. Yet what do we find&#x003F; He has one ruling for the Unionist-Nationalist side of the House, another ruling for the Labour side. When Mr. Boydell, in the course of his speech on Thursday, was talking about the few members of His Majesty&#x2019;s &#x2018;great Opposition &#x201D; who were present while Mr. Madeley was &#x2018;defending himself from the untruthful, malicious, and contemptuous attacks made on him by the men (&#x201C;scum &#x201D; is more the word), who sat on those benches,&#x2019; he was called upon by Mr. Speaker to withdraw those words and at the same time apologise to the House. Yet, when the &#x2018;Great&#x2019; Sir Thomas Smartt rises and calls the Labour members &#x2018;six grasshoppers,&#x2019; that, in the Speaker&#x2019;s estimation, is Parliamentary language. So much for Mr. Speaker&#x2019;s impartiality. Personally, I do not think that Gallant Six will trouble their heads over Mr. Speaker or the rest, because, after all, it&#x2019;s not Parliament that counts, but the people of the country. Their answer to the Government will shortly be given through Liesbeek. Trusting, sir, that you will not consign this to your waste-paper basket, but give me fair play and publish this letter. I sign my name.&#x201D; Concluding, Mr. Mentz said that he hoped that, having brought that to the notice of the House, some means would be devised and some action would be taken to put an end to these most derogatory remarks, directed not only at the Speaker, but also to the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>My attention has already been called to the letter quoted by the hon. member, but, as far as I am personally concerned, I would prefer the House to treat it with the contempt it deserves. (Hear, hear.) Reflections such as those contained in the letter in question in the public Press are, no doubt, calculated to bring the members of this House and the proceedings of this House into contempt, and the hon. member was therefore perfectly right in drawing the attention of this House to the matter. The best course of dealing with the question raised would be by means of an inquiry through a Select Committee. The fact, however, that the hon. member has called the attention of the House to this matter will, no doubt, serve as a warning, and I would suggest to him and to the House that the matter be not pursued any further on the present occasion.</p>

<heading>IN COMMITTEE.</heading>

<p>The House resumed in Committee on the Indemnity and Undesirables Special Deportation Bill.</p>

<p>On clause 2, Indemnity of Government and its officers, etc., for certain acts.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person></from>

<p>said that when progress had been reported on Wednesday, sub-section 3 of clause 2 was under discussion, and the hon. member for Cape Town, Harbour (Sir H. H. Juta) had pointed out that there was some overlapping between sub-section 1 and sub-section 3, and he recognised the justice of the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks. Hon. members would see that sub-section 1 referred to actions which had been done under Martial Law between January 8 and 14, and subsection 2 dealt with the period for which Martial Law had been enforced for the areas over which it had been proclaimed. Sub-section 3 was intended to deal with those areas where it had not been proclaimed, and he therefore proposed that the following words be added at the end of paragraph 3: &#x201C;Subsequent to the proclamation thereof and prior to the 31st day of January, 1914.&#x201D; The operation of that sub-section would be limited to that period from the proclamation of Martial Law to the meeting of Parliament, and no acts done under Martial Law or otherwise in suppression of disorder after the 30th January would be protected by the provisions of that Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hertzog">

<from>General <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. B. M. HERTZOG</person> (Smithfield)</from>

<p>submitted that was not sufficient, and referred to sub-section 2. He said that there also they must say during what period, otherwise, as it stood there, anything done prior to the proclamation of Martial Law, as long as it complied with the other conditions, would be in the same position as any act done under sub-sections 1 and 2. He hoped that the Minister would have the same limitation in sub-section 2.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person></from>

<p>said that the hon. member was quite correct, and that limitation ought to apply to subsection 2 also. He moved that the words &#x201C;subsequent to the proclamation thereof&#x201D; be added at the end of sub-section 2.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#merriman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. X. MERRIMAN</person> (Victoria West)</from>

<p>asked whether that gave indemnity for a case such as had been brought up the previous day &#x2014; the case of the unfortunate Mr. Chester&#x003F; Certainly. Surely his hon. friend could not mean that. He thought the Minister ought to give some safeguard in a case of that kind. As the Bill had been originally framed, the intention of the framer (he did not say of the Minister) was to give a plenary absolution, which was, he believed, an indulgence of the Church absolving the man, not only of all the <span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0384"/>sins he had committed, but of all he might commit to the end of his life It was a very fine thing that indeed. (Laughter.) Jesting apart, it would be a monstrous thing if they were to prohibit or put to expense anyone subjected to such an outrage and to debar him from ordinary redress.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person></from>

<p>said that he would like to say, in regard to the case of Mr. Chester, that he had examined it, but had not the full reports yet. If the facts were as stated in the letter, it would not come under that Indemnity Act for acts done in good faith for the suppression of disorder. It would be a malicious act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#merriman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. X. MERRIMAN</person> (Victoria West)</from>

<p>said that his hon. friend had not had the same experience he had of Martial Law, otherwise he would know the onus lay upon the man to prove that what had been done was not done in good faith. He could tell him it was a denial of justice and an outrage on every sense of justice; and they looked upon the Minister of Justice to see that these things were not done and guard them against them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kuhn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. G. KUHN</person> (Prieska)</from>

<p>said that there might be hundreds and thousands of cases other than the case of Mr. Chester. They did not know. He did not mind voting for the Bill, provided they made provision for a case like that of Mr. Chester. He knew what they had suffered under Martial Law, and they must make the matter quite clear</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#creswell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. H. P. CRESWELL</person> (Jeppe)</from>

<p>said that exactly the same outrages had been committed in areas where Martial Law had been proclaimed. If the whole burden were placed on the complainant to prove bad faith, it was practically impossible for anyone, either in a district where Martial Law had been proclaimed or where it had not been proclaimed, to get redress.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#merriman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. X. MERRIMAN</person> (Victoria West)</from>

<p>pointed out that he was not in charge of the Bill. From what the Minister of Justice had said he thought he had grasped the situation, and wanted to see justice done.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hertzog">

<from>Genl. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. B. M. HERTZOG</person> (Smithfield)</from>

<p>said he wanted to move an amendment to sub-section 2. On the paper he had an amendment to move a separate clause 5, but after consideration he had seen that if he allowed clause 2 to pass he would eventually be ruled out of order, as it would be somewhat in conflict with clause 2. He wished to move the following proviso to sub-section 2: &#x201C;Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the Court of Appeal, consisting of the three ordinary judges of appeal, or of at least two of the said judges and one extraordinary judge of-appeal, shall have the right and shall be competent to institute an inquiry, after the ordinary manner of a court of first instance, into and to hear any case which may be brought before the same either by way of action, petition, or other legal proceeding arising out of any act in respect of which the claim to restitution or compensation as against the Government has by this Act been discharged or made void; and every person having an interest in such action, petition or other legal proceeding shall have the right to bring the same before the said court. In the event of the Court of Appeal, thus constituted, finding that the act which has given rise to the injustice forming the subject matter of complaint, is one of such a nature that, although bona fide, the limits of what was necessary under the circumstances were thereby transgressed in such a manner as in the opinion of the court was not justifiable, and that according to right and equity restitution or compensation, in part or in whole, should be made, the said court shall make such recommendation to Parliament as it may deem right and just. The legal remedy hereby afforded shall be prescribed within six months after the coming into operation of this Act.&#x201D;</p>

<debateSection name="#condemnation_without_trial">

<heading>CONDEMNATION WITHOUT TRIAL.</heading>

<p>Continuing, the hon. member said he thought that if there was anything they had to provide for it was that they should at the present moment adopt a course which would not in the future be used against them as a precedent, and a very bad precedent. He thought it was expected from every one of them that they should give the Government every protection. When they considered what had happened from the 8th of January until the present day they could not say anything except what had been laid before the House by the Minister of Defence. He was prepared to take everything the Minister had said as correct, but they did not get away from the fact that this ex parte statement was condemnation without any trial. (Hear, hear.) They were giving away rights&#x2014;preventing men who had claims from prosecuting them against the Government. By all means lot them say they were prepared to deprive these men of going to court, but do not let them bar these men from laying their claims before a competent, high and impartial tribunal, who would make recommendations to that House in order that justice might be done to these people. They wanted a tribunal of the highest character that would enjoy the complete confidence of every man in that country, and he did it the more because of the unfortunate statement of the Minister of Defence as to the unreliability of the courts hearing and deciding upon these matters. They might have a Court of Appeal consisting of two judges of the court with an extraordinary judge, and let the court be open to anybody who had or thought he had a case against the Government. He did not say the court should have the power to come to a final decision, but should only recommend <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0385"/>to that House and leave it to the House to decide. They did not know what had been done under Martial Law. Gross injustices might have been done. He knew personally of cases of which the Minister of Defence knew nothing. He could mention a case where two women came to him with tears in their eyes, and said that burghers or some other officials had smashed down the door of their house and asked for the husband of one. These men, no doubt, were acting in good faith, but they might have done things very much worse than the case he had mentioned.</p>

<heading>DEPORTEES&#x2019; RIGHTS.</heading>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">Minister</person></from>

<p>said on the previous day that the Government would inquire into these cases and do what was right. He submitted that they had no right first to take away the right of a man going to court, and then trust to the mercy of the Government. The Government might decide against a man, and that man would have a grievance for years to come. But if they gave him access to a court of that kind they would not only be doing what was right, but they would for the future secure what ought to be done&#x2014;they would not have laid down a bad example to be followed by future generations. This remedy would be prescribed in six months. Any man to whom any injury had been done would have access to the court, and so would the deported men. They would also have the right of coming to this court and saying, &#x201C;I, or we, have been dealt with unjustly under the circumstances.&#x201D; It was more than likely it was probable, that there were one or two cases of men deported against whom no case had been made out, and these men ought to be given an opportunity of coming to an impartial tribunal and saying, &#x201C;We challenge the Government to prove to us that it has done what is right and necessary under the circumstances in order to place this judgment upon us of excommunicating us from South Africa.&#x201D; If the court found that there was no real grounds for deportation against one or more of these men it might recommend to Parliament. Parliament was not only asked to indemnify the Government against what had been done&#x2014;that they were prepared to do&#x2014; but to go further and turn deportation into banishment for life, and that without any judicial evidence before them, without opportunity being given to these men to lay before Parliament the facts from their point of view. It was in order not to establish a precedent of this kind that he had moved in this direction. That was the very least that they as a Parliament ought to insist upon. If the Government did not desire to do that then it could bring in an Act providing for all cases of a similar kind that happened during July and January, providing punishment by law and a special court.</p>

<heading>AN UNPRECEDENTED PROPOSAL.</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person></from>

<p>said he would challenge the hon. member (General Hertzog) to show him in any of the Indemnity Bills which had been passed in this country and the various colonies of South Africa a precedent for what he proposed. (Hear, hear.) He had looked for one and he could find he provision to that effect, and for the very simple reason that the Indemnity Act fell to the ground at once. (Hear, hear.)</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the hon. member has read carefully this involved amendment himself. I shall go through the clause and show the House what it means. Proceeding, the Minister said that the Court of Appeal was to be the Court to hear these cases as a court of first instance. The South Africa Act had laid down positively that the Court of Appeal should be a Court of Appeal only, and should only hear cases which came to it on appeal for review from other courts of first instance. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member was not satisfied with the South Africa Act, of which he was one of the framers. He now wished to make the Court of Appeal a court of first instance to hear cases ab initio. What would be the effect of that&#x003F; Supposing his amendment were accepted, a case might be brought before this Court of Appeal, and that court might make a recommendation to Parliament, as was proposed in the amendment. At the same time the individual concerned started an action in a court of first instance, because the action taken by the Government had not been bona fide. The other courts of first instance were open to him, and a provision was made that if a man had acted mala fide the courts were open to him. The individual concerned went to the court of ordinary jurisdiction, and that court came to a certain decision, an appeal was made from that decision, an appeal on a point of law. To whom was that appeal to be made&#x003F; Should the appeal be made to the Court of Appeal, which had already sat in the case as a court of first instance&#x003F; It must be plain to the committee that it was quite impossible to make the Court of Appeal a court of first instance under this Act, and at the same time allow it to retain its functions as a Court of Appeal under the South Africa Act. It was unworkable. Let them proceed further. The hon. member proposed that the Court of Appeal, sitting as a court of first instance, should be competent to institute an inquiry into and to hear any cases which may be brought before the same by way of action, petition, or other legal proceeding, etc., so that any person who felt himself aggrieved under Martial Law by acts done by the Government or its servants could <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0386"/>go to this court and have his case inquired into.</p>

</speech>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#why_an_indemnity_act&#x003f;">

<heading>WHY AN INDEMNITY ACT&#x003F;</heading>

<p>Why then pass an Indemnity Act&#x003F; (Ministerial cheers.) The whole abject of an Indemnity Act was to silence all actions. Actions arising out of acts which had been done in good faith, and steps which had been taken in good faith by the Government and its servants were protected under this clause. They did not want the courts to inquire for years and years afterwards into the grievances of thousands of people who thought themselves aggrieved under Martial Law. The hon. member, however, wanted a court, and a Court of Appeal, to sit and listen to all these cases. &#x201C;Well, then, I say,&#x201D; the Minister went on, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t let us pass the Indemnity Act.&#x201D; (Hear, hear.) Leave the courts of the land to these people.&#x201D; He proceeded to say that not only were these cases going to occupy the Court of Appeal for years, but all these cases had to come to Parliament, too. Hundreds of thousands of grievances from the Court of Appeal would have to be considered case by case by this Parliament. (Hear, hear.) This Bill was intended to be an Indemnity Bill, and a clause like this made it a Bill of an entirely different character, and made it an impossible Bill, certainly a Bill which the Government would not accept. The hon. member had said that all cases should be brought before this court, but the court should report to Parliament only in regard to certain cases where the limits of necessity had been exceeded. He did not limit the applicants or the claims before this court to cases where necessity had been exceeded&#x2014;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>But the recommendation can only be made in cases where the limits of what was necessary have been exceeded. In a question of a man having acted in good faith, if by using his fists he could have achieved his object better than by using a pick handle the case may be reported. I can only say that it is absolutely preposterous to think that every action which has been taken in good faith under Martial Law shall now be inquired into to find whether the force which was used was not more than was necessary in that particular case. I say that it is novel, that it is extraordinary and unprecedented in cases of this kind, and that the Government would stultify itself if it accepted this amendment. (Hear, hear.)</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hertzog">

<from>General <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. B. M. HERTZOG</person> (Smith-field)</from>

<p>said he would ask the Minister to consider this amendment. His excuses were of the most flimsy kind. They were not worthy of a big thing like this. (Hear, hear.) In the first place, the Minister had stated that he (General Hertzog) was not satisfied with the South Africa Act. Yes, he was very much satisfied with the South Africa Act, but was there any reason way that high tribunal should not also be asked by Parliament and by the country to do special work of a very extraordinary nature for this occasion&#x003F; Surely there was not the least reason. If the Minister found such a great difficulty in the way, let him (General Hertzog) ask him to show a way of getting some other tribunal which would be acceptable to him. The Minister was the person who had objected to the ordinary tribunals of the country. He was trying to satisfy the Minister&#x2019;s squeamishness. The Minister&#x2019;s next point was that this tribunal would sit both as a court of first instance and might afterwards sit as a Court of Appeal. Was there any likelihood of the same cases coming in appeal before the Court of Appeal and at the same time in first instance&#x003F; Let him remind his hon. friend that this court was there only for special cases whereby under this Indemnity Bill the action had been taken away from that person. Then it was said, &#x201C;Why an Indemnity Act&#x003F;&#x201D; Did not the Minister see that the Indemnity Act was to indemnify them&#x2014;to indemnify the wrongdoers&#x2014;(Labour cheers)&#x2014;to protect them against lawful claims which the country and private individuals might have against them. Were those people who had suffered from these illegal acts to remain unprotected&#x003F; Even in time of war the military went and they said that certain fortifications should be raised, and fortifications were raised, but when the time was over these people went to a proper court, although the military had been indemnified. The Minister wanted to have himself and the other members of the Government indemnified and protected, but he did not want the innocent men who had suffered to be compensated for the evils they had to undergo because of circumstances.</p>

<p>Although they had the fullest confidence in the Ministers, was it fair that these men should be made to rely, solely on what the Ministers deemed to be right&#x003F; Could the Minister point to a single incident to serve as a precedent for his asking that the men sent out of the country should be banished without trial&#x003F; (Labour cheers.) All the court could do, proceeded General Hertzog, would be to make representations to Parliament, and Parliament would decide. He could not conceive of anything which would be fairer. The Minister&#x2019;s objections had been too hasty, and if he wished to do what was just he should adopt something of the kind he (General Hertzog) had proposed. By all means let there be a judicial inquiry&#x2014;-an inquiry in which the whole of the country would have faith. If the Minister did not want people to be knocking at the doors of Parliament for years to come and complaining that they had been unjustly treated, let him do something in the direction he (General Hertzog) had indicated, and if the Minister did that he (General Hertzog) was prepared to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p>said he wanted to get from the Minister what he was going to do by way of limiting sub-clause 3 as regards area. If sub-clause 3 remained in he saw no need for subclauses 1 and 2. The reason for proclaiming Martial Law in some districts and not in others was that the stringent conditions of Martial Law should not be extended over a larger area than was necessary, but if they indemnified the officers of the Crown and others for illegal actions committed in districts not under Martial Law what was the use of proclaiming Martial Law at all&#x003F; If the clause was intended only to cover commandeering by burghers while on their way to Martial Law areas, that should specially be provided for. He did not think the amendment of the hon. member for Smithfield (General Hertzog) would quite meet the case, for the only additional safeguard it gave was that it made an officer liable if he went further than the necessities of the case required. If they admitted the necessities of Martial Law at all it was very unfair that officers who had to administer it should come before a tribunal and be judged after the events in order to see that what they did was more than the necessities of the case demanded. It was very easy after an event to show that it was not necessary. (Hear hear.) Parliament would not be acting fairly to those officers who had been carrying out the commands of Government if they were punished for going beyond what Parliament now thought was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>said if no illegal acts had been performed it would not have been necessary to come to Parliament, but it was just because illegal acts had been done that an Indemnity Bill was required. Did the amendment mean that everybody who thought they had been illegally treated could bring an action against the Government&#x003F; If the amendment were adopted he did not see why they should have an Indemnity Bill at all. If the deported men had the right to bring an action against Government he did not know what position the country would be placed in. The Government had fully admitted that these acts were illegal under ordinary circumstances, but it now asked to be indemnified from the consequences because these acts had been done under Martial Law.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. HENDERSON</person> (Durban, Berea)</from>

<p>said the Court of Appeal under the amendment would make representations to Parliament, but if the latter had to deal with matters of that kind it would be utterly impossible for it to carry on its ordinary work.</p>

<p>Proceeding, the hon. member asked whether such cases would be impartially considered in Parliament. He wanted to draw attention to sub section (c). It was absolutely necessary that officers who got such enormous powers put into their hands, as happened under Martial Law, should be schooled in the nature of their duty, so that, should Martial Law ever again become necessary, there should be some uniformity of application. Some of the acts of some of the officers the Minister of Defence would explain by their being new to their work, and actuated by political bias. The sentences and penalities depended upon the temperament of the officer in charge, and had little of the judicial uniformity associated with the civil courts. Referring to the case of the signalman in Natal who had been sentenced to 12 months&#x2019; hard labour, the hon. member said he desired to make a correction. He had been reported as saying that the man had had no trial, but what he meant to infer was that he had had no trial in the civil courts, because the man had been tried in a court under Martial Law. He wanted to make that matter quite clear.</p>

<speech by="#creswell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. H. P. CRESWELL</person> (Jeppe)</from>

<p>said he wanted to refer to what had been said by the hon. member for Fordsburg (Mr. Duncan) in regard to the objections he had raised to that amendment. The hon. member had taken the view, with which one sympathised, that a man who had a great responsibility placed on his shoulders and in an emergency had made a decision, later on should not be put under the microscope as to what he had done being or not being in excess of what he should have done under ordinary circumstances. While what the hon. member had said was perfectly true, or would be true, in a state of war, it did not cover the situation which they had been through. When Martial Law had been declared it had been declared in a situation in which it had never before been declared, and that did away with the objection raised by the hon. member. Martial Law had not been declared against enemies in the field or against a foreign invasion, but it had been declared, as they on the cross-benches had stated, under the excuse of cheeking excesses, for the purpose of crushing a perfectly legitimate organisation. When people failed to distinguish between use and abuse of a thing, and when they said that they were going to declare war against the people and their legitimate organisations, the objections raised by the hon. member no longer applied. The utmost care was required and the utmost possible safeguards were necessary in giving indemnity under such circumstances. If, according to the Minister&#x2019;s own statement, there might have been hundreds to thousands of cases where acts committed by officers had (been so greatly in excess of the needs, surely all the more reason for having such an inquiry&#x2014;if all these cases had arisen in that short period. It bore out all that they on the cross-benches had said.</p>

<p>The hon. member again referred to events which had taken place at Benoni and elsewhere, and said that they asked for nothing better than that these cases should be taken to a proper tribunal of judges <span class="col_763-764" refersTo="page_0388"/>of the land. They (the Labour members) were so confident of their case that they asked for such a tribunal to be set up. He did not want to refer to these cases ad nauseam.</p>

Proceeding, he said surely it was wrong for a man who had been wronged during the time Martial Law was in force or while Martial Law had not been decreed not to be allowed to go to the courts.

He was astonished at the remarks of the hon. member for Smithfield, and was glad to see chat he had reformed. He admitted there was a good deal in what the hon. member for Jeppe said about compensation, but he instinctively thought of the others at the moment. Were they going to compensate these other people&#x003F; Did Parliament really mean to pay compensation, and if so, who was going to find the money&#x003F; What steps had been taken to bring justice home to those people who had committed these crimes&#x003F; As far as he knew, practically none.

He thought that by this time there would have been a Select Committee at work, which would have brought up a report and discovered who was responsible for these outrages, how it was the police were not there, how no attempts were made to protect these people, and see whether Parliament could not give the aggrieved ones any redress. Now they were dealing with an entirely different thing. The hon. member for Troyeville could not see that there was another class of people who had grievances, and who were no more to blame than he was himself. What did his hon. friend say about the editor who was removed to another district where there was Martial Law, so that he might be punished&#x003F; The Minister of Justice had acknowledged that it was a serious thing.</p>

<p>The Minister had still got a conscience, and he hoped that he would retain those finer feelings of his Parliamentary youth, even when the shadows of the prison house gathered round him. (Laughter.) There was no doubt that there were people who had just claims against the Government. The question was, how were they going to meet those cases&#x003F; Of course they had the case of the man who was fined &#x00A3;2 or fourteen days for saying, &#x201C;Hullo, Japie,&#x201D; to a policeman, and he (the speaker) had thought that that man had been very hardly dealt with. But that was not the sort of case he meant. All they wanted to do was to provide that the onus of showing a want of bona fides should not lay on the man who had a just grievance. He would, therefore, move to add at the end of the clause, &#x201C;Provided that after the taking effect of this Act, the Government shall nominate one or more judges of the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal to whom any person who may deem that he has a just cause of complaint in respect of the acts committed under Martial Law may apply, and the said judge shall, on inquiry and being satisfied, issue a certificate to that effect, and thereafter the onus of proving bona fides or necessity in any action brought by such individuals in the ordinary courts of the Union shall be on the Government or the agent of the Government against whom such action may be brought, anything to the contrary in this Act notwithstanding.&#x201D;</p>

<p>was understood to say that he had a bias in favour of legal forms. The only persons who would benefit by the amendment of the right, hon. member for Victoria West would be the lawyers. He could see that the right hon. member&#x2019;s point was to deal with eases of real injustice, and he thought the only possible way was to take the whole question on the broad basis as to which tribunal should deal with these cases.</p>

<p>In the case of the amendment of the hon. member for Smithfield they had this curious position, that any case of any description arising since January 3th was a case which might be brought before this Court of Appeal as now constituted by the hon. member. This court had to decide, <span class="col_765-766" refersTo="page_0389"/>first of all, whether the claim was bona fide, whether the Act was done in good faith, and afterwards to make a futile recommendation. Was the Court of Appeal going to lightly take on this job of being asked to sit as a judicial court without giving a final decision&#x003F; Then the question arose, who was to find the money &#x003F; Parliament, of course. He would point out to the hon. member that should judges recommend that a man be paid, if the case were as clear as crystal, when the case came before Parliament and the Government did not recommend it, they were absolutely powerless. Not a single member of the House could move that a penny of compensation should be paid to that man. It seemed to him that the only way to deal with the matter was to constitute courts on the lines of the special Compensation Courts instituted after the war, where people went to make out their cases and the courts had to decide whether they were proper and to make their awards. He would urge upon the Minister to consider the question of leaving the onus on the Government of proving that the act was done in good faith. He thought the Government was pressing it too far when it said that every claimant must show that the official complained of was not acting in good faith.</p>

(Laughter.) As he understood the hon. member for Smithfield, what was at the back of his motion was that this was an Indemnity Bill indemnifying certain persons, and they followed the ordinary course of an Indemnity Bill by throwing the onus of proof on the man who said that the act was not done bona fide. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; said the hon. member for Smithfield, &#x201C;I leave that; I do not touch that, but I say that there are a certain number of cases where people have suffered an injury owing to excessive force being required. I do not want any action to be open against these persons, but I say that the country in whose interest these acts have been done shall compensate the people.&#x201D;</p>

<p>said that the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Merriman) misunderstanding that, wished to reverse the onus of proof, but that had nothing to do with the point made by the hon. member for Smithfield. He was quite willing to stand by the Act of Indemnity, indemnifying the persons who had done the acts, And, therefore, the right hon. gentleman&#x2019;s amendment to alter the onus of proof did not in any way fit in with the object of the hon. member for Smithfield. He (Sir Henry) did not understand the hon. member for Newlands in respect of the onus of proof. It seemed to him the two things were entirely different. He adhered to the principle of indemnifying all persons who had acted in good faith. It appeared to him that the hon. member for Smithfield would really bring about chaos.</p>

<p>To throw, for instance, upon a judicial court, the Court of Appeal, the burden of saying whether a deported person should remain outside or not was throwing upon them a political burden which they should not for one moment be asked to deal with. (Hear, hear.) He had voted for the principle of indemnity and he saw no reason why they should alter that. It was the common ordinary form of indemnity which they had always maintained, the form both here and in England, and it was a form which had stood the test of time. At the same time he was not afraid of a precedent, in fact he thought monuments should be erected to those people who had had the courage to establish precedents Now came the other principle which was put forward, in other words should they establish some court or some body which would deal with compensation for injuries committed&#x003F; That was what was really at the back of the amendment of the hon. member for Smithfield, that as to the people who had suffered injury unnecessarily in the public interest they should do something for them. There was a great deal to be said for that, and he thought the hon. member would have a good deal of support, but surely this was not the place for that&#x2014; where they were dealing with the indemnity of individuals for acts done in good faith to establish a body or court to adjudge compensation, whether this Act did not apply or did apply.</p>

<p>said his hon. friend (Sir H. H. Juta) had misunderstood him, and he thought he might venture to cross swords with him. This Act went a great deal further than the Acts of Indemnity in England. The case of Governor Eyre went far beyond the ordinary case of indemnity in England. He took it that a man must establish his right, whether they called it compensation or whatever it was, by proving his case before the Court. The difficulty in this Bill, as it was now drawn, was that that man had to prove a want of bona fides against the Government.</p>

He did not <span class="col_767-768" refersTo="page_0390"/>want a judge to try a case and give any judgment upon it or say whether it was done in good faith, or not in good faith.

<p>said the amendment of the right hon. member for Victoria West was concerned with the onus of proof, but he (General Hertzog) was concerned with compensation payable to people who had been asked to make heavy sacrifices in the interests of the country. The objection raised by the hon. member for Cape Town, Harbour (Sir H. H. Juta) was that the amendment was foreign to an Indemnity Act. However, he (Gen. Hertzog) submitted that it was part and parcel of an Indemnity Act unless the Government was going to give them the assurance that it would bring in a Bill to deal with the complementary question, but they had had not a single word from Government that it intended to do anything of the kind. Ordinary justice demanded that people should be compensated by the State which had benefited by the act from which these people suffered. It was rather invidious to ask any of the judges to undertake recommendations of a political kind.

Continuing, General Hertzog said as to the point raised by the right hon. member for Victoria West&#x2014;that any man who thought he had a cause for complaint entitling him to compensation being allowed to make a claim would involve too many cases&#x2014;the difficulty was to get a law which would open the way to giving compensation to those who deserved it, at the same time withholding it from those who did not deserve it.

He did not think such a provision should be put into this Bill. There were many men who had suffered severely during Martial Law who would not be able to obtain compensation, because they would not be in a position to bring an action against any one particular person as being responsible for what they had Suffered.</p>

<p>said he could give no undertaking whatever. The question was, of course, an important one, but he was not prepared to say now on that Bill what the Government would do <span class="col_769-770" refersTo="page_0391"/>apart from that question. He did not think it was necessary to reply at length to the amendments which had been moved. The amendment of the hon. member for Smith field (General Hertzog) was quite out of what the Bill was intended for. The amendment of the right hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. Merriman) was unworkable, and he did not think the results which the hon. member aimed at would be attained. The right hon. member had raised a point in sub-section 3, that it was very wide, and that acts were condoned which had taken place in districts which were not under Martial Law. The Government, although the strike had been a general one, and many of its operations had spread over South Africa, had not thought it advisable to declare Martial Law generally, but the proclamation had been so worded that, in a sense, it covered the country. &#x201C;I do,&#x201D; stated the proclamation, &#x201C;hereby call upon all persons resident in the Union&#x2026;&#x201D; The final paragraph said that, as a temporary measure and until a further proclamation, the districts set forth in the schedule were declared to be under Martial Law, as Martial Law was understood in His Majesty&#x2019;s Dominions. Under the state of affairs which had arisen, exceptional measures had had to be taken in areas which were not under Martial Law. If they took a district like Volksrust, it had not been under Martial Law, but the railway system had been hung up there. Special measures had had to be taken to clear the line, to control the situation, and to get the traffic through. If special measures had been taken there, he wanted the Government and the officers to be indemnified, although no Martial Law had been proclaimed there. These were the acts to which sub-section 3 would apply. He, therefore, thought that the amendment which he had moved in sub-section 3 sufficiently covered the difficulty, and that it was not necessary to take further exception to that sub-section. He hoped that, after the long discussion which had now taken place on that clause, it would be possible to come to a vote on these amendments. As to the sub-section dealing with bona fides, they had a similar provision in the two Cape Acts of 1900 and 1902, and in the Transvaal Acts. He was simply following the existing precedents in the case, and proposed no novel legislation there.</p>

<p>said that the Government did not appear to apprehend the importance of the matter which had been brought forward by the hon. member for Smithfield (General Hertzog). Why had not the Minister taken the precedents in regard to the matter brought forward by the hon. member for Smith-field&#x003F; He should like to point out to the hon. member for Cape Town, Harbour (Sir H. H. Juta), that a very similar provision was contained in the Indemnity Bill of 1900 to deal with Martial Law, for which a large number of members on that side of the House and some of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own colleagues had been responsible. It had been forced into the Cape Bill by the right hon. member for Victoria West, seconded by the late Mr. Sauer, that there should be an inquiry. He did not think that the Government should put them in the position of refusing an inquiry now that hon. members had felt the iron heel of Martial Law after insisting on it, when they had felt Martial Law themselves in 1902. At that time the hon. member for Oudtshoorn (Mr. Schoeman) had said that he was prepared to vote for the Indemnity Bill, provided there was a Commission. The present Minister of Education (Mr. Malan) had also wanted a Commission at that time, which, he said, would smooth over the differences. (Labour cheers.) The impression might now be created that the Minister was prepared to protect his friends, and not the others. (Labour cheers.) He (Mr. Fremantle) wished to eradicate that impression in the country, by doing the same thing now as they had done in 1902. The present Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Van Heerden) had then said that if they wanted to pacify the country, they must have an inquiry into the working of Martial Law. (Labour cheers.) He was glad that the Minister of Defence had not definitely announced that he was not prepared not to do so, but why could not the Minister have said that there would be fair inquiry into the matter, when the Government would put itself in a more favourable position with regard to that Indemnity Bill&#x2014;and he (Mr. Fremantle) was prepared to support indemnity. Dealing with a statement made in England that the Bill should be brought before the Privy Council, the hon. member said that they were all opposed to the English authorities interfering with their legislation, but he pointed it out to show that it was felt in England that there ought to be a judicial inquiry before the whole matter was blotted out.</p>

If the clause were passed, he did not know where the people who had supplied large quantities of goods without the price being fixed were going to be paid. There ought to be some provision for some sort of court to settle these cases, and in common fairness to the people, the amendment of the hon. member for Smithfield <span class="col_771-772" refersTo="page_0392"/>should be adopted.

<p>said it was a great pity that compensation should be discussed at this stage. For many days the House had discussed the whole question of the principle of Martial Law, and had come to the conclusion that Martial Law was justified. The question of compensation was never raised at all during the second reading debate. If hon. members thought that question should have been introduced, they should have moved an amendment to put it into the Bill, but that they had not done. Whether it was right or wrong to compensate people, this was not the time to discuss it. The point the House had to consider now was not whether compensation ought to be paid, but whether the limitations under which it was asked to condone what had illegally been done were adequate and sufficient protection for people who had been unjustly treated. The indemnity was not limited to acts done during the period of Martial Law or in districts where Martial Law was enforced. It was very difficult to say what else could be done. Otherwise, the only course would have been to impose Martial Law throughout the country, and the inconvenience that would have caused would have been far greater than the inconvenience resulting from acts done in districts adjoining those in which Martial Law was enforced. In his own constituency people suffered very grave inconvenience, and naturally they did not like it, but it must be remembered that the people who suffered that inconvenience were, in all probability, relieved from suffering very much greater inconvenience, but for the presence of the forces, who were able to prevent disorder taking place. (Hear, hear.) In conclusion, he said he thought they should pass the section as it stood.</p>

<heading>SHOOTING OF NATIVES.</heading>

<speech by="#meyler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. MEYLER</person> (Weenen)</from>

<p>moved the deletion of &#x201C;(a) His Excellency the Governor-General; or. &#x201D; He said he did so for the purpose of bringing to the notice of the House the shooting of certain natives under Martial Law. One was shot on the railway line at Heidelberg on January 15; one on the Van Ryn Estates on January 7; one at Randfontein on January 18, and one at the Robinson Central Deep on January 22. The reason he mentioned His Excellency the Governor-General was that he was the person who authorised Martial Law, and he had a dual liability in this matter not only in South Africa but in Great Britain, where the shooting of a native was looked upon as a more serious matter than it was by the Minister of Defence, who had refused to consider the cases of the people who had suffered wrongs under Martial Law. Proceeding, the hon. member referred to a case that happened on an island off the coast of Africa in 1782. The Governor of the island, considering that certain men had mutinied, found out the ringleader and sentenced him to a number of lashes, with the result that the man died. Twenty years after the Governor, Joseph Wall, I went to England, where he was tried and hanged. Continuing, he said that here they had a definite instance of natives being shot, and not one word of explanation except the short details furnished in the reply to a question had come from the Minister. With regard to the Van Ryn affair, it was stated that the natives refused to work, but a censored newspaper report stated that 100 natives broke out, that they were rounded up by burghers, and that one of the natives was shot in the leg. The Minister has since told the House that this native had died. The remainder were brought before the court and fined &#x00A3;1 each.</p>

<p>The question was, were the men to be killed under Martial Law for offences which the court thought could be met by a fine of &#x00A3;1&#x003F; Were they to submit quietly to that sort of thing in a British Dominion&#x003F; With regard to the case at Heidelberg, it appears from the newspaper reports that Major Kemp&#x2019;s men saw two natives on the line, and the one was shot in trying to escape, and that dynamite was found on the line. He (Mr. Meyler) did not notice this case mentioned in the report of dynamite outrages. When people began to use firearms it was a very serious thing. The Minister certainly said that in one case the man had been shot accidentally. With regard to all the cases, he pointed out that they had happened over a month ago, and surely the Minister was able to furnish them with a further explanation. With regard to sub-section 3, Mr. Meyler pointed out with regard to the Jagersfontein affair that an official of the Native Affairs Department who gave evidence stated that the shooting was unnecessary. Yet the Minister did not give them any explanation of this affair in his second reading speech. They had to deal differently with natives than they did with Europeans, and he said that there was far more danger of a rising among mine natives by the use of firearms than by all the strikes that took place among the white men.</p>

<speech by="#madeley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. B. MADELEY</person> (Springs)</from>

<p>said he thought the committee was indebted to the hon. member for bringing these cases forward. He pointed out that the House took an extraordinarily different view of the destruction of human life and the destruction of property. They first thought that the amendment of the hon. member for Smithfield meant that every person who thought he had been injured would have an opportunity of coming before that particular <span class="col_773-774" refersTo="page_0393"/>court and pleading his cause with some hope of redress. It was only when the member for Cape Town, Harbour, discussed the matter that they found what was really behind it. So soon as the committee learnt that that blessed word &#x201C;compensation&#x201D; was behind the whole thing they pricked up their ears and jumped up to express their views on the question. It had also been explained that in the 1900 Indemnity Act the same sort of amendment was put in the measure.</p>

<p>He entirely agreed with the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Merriman) in his desire that the onus of proof as to bona fides should be cast upon the Government. There had been so many instances, glaring instances, of deliberate cold-blooded actions on the part of the emissaries of the Government that it was necessary that the Government should have to prove its bona fides in each individual case wherever an individual desired to bring an action. The hon. member for Weenen had brought up the case of the Kafir who was shot at Van Ryn. He (Mr. Madeley) had received the testimony of no fewer than four individuals who were present on the Van Ryn Mine on that occasion. His information was that two Kafirs were shot. He did not propose to deal with the shooting. These natives went into a plantation, where they were herded up and driven back to the compound, not by the most direct route, but by the most circuitous route, so as to be an object-lesson to the men in the single quarters. They were driven by burghers, who had sjamboks. They were called upon to halt, but they did not understand what was meant, and when they did not halt they were sjambokked.</p>

Continuing, Mr. Madeley said that if these natives halted when they were not called upon to halt they were again sjambokked. He could not understand how this committee could be sitting there discussing how far indemnity should carry. They should be considering whether they should grant indemnity or not. He thought the majority of members in that House should decide that no indemnity at all should be granted.</p>

<heading>SOME BENONI CASES.</heading>

<p>He would give some of the cases. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Merriman) had referred in moving terms to the case of the editor of the &#x201C;Diggers News.&#x201D; He would supply the case of the editor of a paper which certainly did not advance the views of individuals on those benches. He was going to the case of the editor of the &#x201C;Benoni Advertiser,&#x2019; a paper which was owned and controlled by Mr. George Constable, who was an M.P.C. in the Unionist interests in the Transvaal. He was set upon by the burghers, knocked down, and, according to his information, his head was split open. There was no intervention by the police. He asked the Minister if he wanted indemnity for incidents like that&#x003F; He would now like to appeal to members of the House on the ground of religious scruples. There was a gentleman in Benoni, a Jew of the most orthodox character, a gentleman who would not move out of his house on his Sabbath Day. That man, during the round-up in Benoni, was gathered into the Minister&#x2019;s fold. The bulk of the people who were so rounded-up, bar this man, were conducted to Boksburg Gaol on foot. For some reason or other, he was kept back till Saturday (his Sabbath), and he was then suddenly ordered to go to Boksburg. He demurred, and asked permission to remain until sundown, and said he would willingly pay for a taxi or walk. He was told he must go at once. He then said that, in order to go to Boksburg Gaol and outrage his religious feelings, they would have to use force. He was thereupon handcuffed. The chief crime, he supposed, of this man was that he was the local Labour candidate for the Provincial Council. One of the Minister&#x2019;s satellites, a local sub inspector, ordered four or five men together and took them to the police station. One of them, a local shopkeeper, had his shop raided and his private apartments searched, to see whether any gelatine or anything of that sort could be discovered. Nothing was discovered on his person. He asked Inspector Loftus, the local man in charge of the police, what he was charged with. His complaint, backed by 13 local witnesses, was that this officer used most obscene language to him, and told him that he should be shot and that his shop should be burned down. An action was already on the way by this gentleman against Loftus, and he (Mr. Madeley) wanted to see to it that this House, by passing the Indemnity Bill, should not preclude the possibility of actions such as this being taken against the Government, for what were nothing more and nothing less than crimes. This man was not a striker, he was a local storekeeper, but he had put on the red rosette. Out of this round-up in Benoni, he supposed arose this question, that Benoni was the &#x201C;hot shop,&#x201D; the warm spot, from the point of view of the rest of the inhabitants, and that it would be the place which was most likely fostering the revolution which the Minister tried to make out was in existence. They were being searched on the Market Square, their homes were searched, but not one stick of dynamite or any other lethal weapon was discovered. So much for the Minister&#x2019;s revolution.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#forced_to_work">

<heading>FORCED TO WORK.</heading>

<p>The hon. Minister had stated that no man had been forced to work. Well, in <span class="col_775-776" refersTo="page_0394"/>that connection he would like to bring them to the Benoni round-up. All those men who agreed to say they were not strikers were allowed to go or they would be taken to Boksburg gaol. The bulk of them went to the gaol. The sequel occurred at Boksburg gaol. After having been there nine or ten days they were interviewed by the local magistrate and a Mr. Alexander, who he (Mr. Madeley) believed was a local solicitor. The magistrate interviewed all those men and told them that Mr. Alexander had power to re-engage all men who were willing to go back to work. Was that not forcing men to go back to work&#x003F; But not one of them would sign on, because they could not get any information whether or not the strike had been declared off. They were revolutionaries in the eyes of the Minister, but they (the Labour members) were proud of those loyal men. Proceeding, he said that that House was prepared to grant indemnity to the Government in absolute ignorance of the facts. That was why he was giving them a few facts, and other hon. members on the cross-benches would give them a few more. What happened when Van Ryn natives were shot&#x003F; The mines sub-inspector, Mr. Loftus, and Mr. Van Rensburg, had the men rounded up and told them they would be given 24 hours to sign on or get off the property. Still, it was stated that nobody was forced back to work. The hon. Minister was laughing. He did not want to hear, but he knew that it was perfectly true. The men sent a deputation to the manager, who stated that he knew nothing about it, apparently these officers were acting on their own. The men were kept in their rooms at each end, and were not allowed to communicate with each other. They refused to sign on, and were told they must get off the property in a specified time. They were told they could not have trolleys to remove their goods, but still they would have to get off by 6 o&#x2019;clock just the same. Was not that forcing them back to work&#x003F; His information was that on the Van Ryn in the Benoni district the men obeyed all orders and there was no excuse for violence, but on that particular property, just before the round-up, some dozen men were playing a quiet game of cricket, and the burghers came up and said they must go to Boksburg gaol straight away. They were not allowed even to get their coats. He supposed that was just one of the little things &#x201C;just over the line,&#x201D; as the Minister had put it. The hon. member for Victoria West had referred to a man who had called a policeman &#x201C;Japie&#x201D; and got fined &#x00A3;2 for the offence, and another gentleman was taken to gaol for smiling at a, policeman. He wanted to ask the committee to carefully look into that paper entitled, &#x201C;Secret outrages committed and attempts to commit charges by explosives and other means during the industrial crisis of 1914.&#x201D; The conspiracy that had been referred to was in that paper. It was a conspiracy engineered and incepted and carried out by the Ministers sitting on the Government benches. If hon. members would please read the list they would be converted to the view of those on the cross-benches, if they had already read it, then he despaired of that House. There was a whole lot of charges of finding dynamite sticks near the rails and haversacks filled with gelatine dropped near culverts.</p>

<p>said he was endeavouring to influence the committee in the right direction. The Government wanted indemnity for having engineered a revolution, so-called; they wanted indemnity for making distinct and definite charges against the working classes of this country, and he was there to repudiate those 38 charges.

<p>said that if he was not in order he would content himself by asking hon. members to go into that.

The Government had brought about an industrial upheaval, all with the object of crushing the Trade Unions. They took a most extraordinary course in order to gain their object.

<speech by="#alberts">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ALBERTS</person> (Standerton)</from>

<p>said he hoped there was a little more truth in the other statements made by the hon. member for Springs than in the one he was going to refer to. Mr. Madeley had exclaimed, &#x201C;I am speaking the truth,&#x201D; when mentioning this matter, but he (Mr. Alberts) wished to say that he (Mr. Madeley) seemed to know very little about the truth in regard to the subject dealt with. The point in question was where he had dealt with the shooting of natives. Now, he (Mr. Alberts) had been the commandant of the burgher forces concerned, and under him he had had at the Van Ryn <span class="col_777-778" refersTo="page_0395"/>mine a most trustworthy officer in Field-Cornet Van Rensburg, The facts of the case had been very carefully investigated by him, and they were riot as the hon. member for Springs had represented them. The trouble was in regard to the natives on the Van Ryn Mine, who had been incited by one of the friends of the hon. member, had broken away from that mine. The man who had incited them had subsequently been arrested at his (Mr. Alberts&#x2019;) instructions. He knew the man was guilty, because he had first arrested the man&#x2019;s father, who, however, had told him that his soil was the guilty person. And if the man&#x2019;s father said so, surely it must be true. When the natives broke away and the police were unable to stop them, Field-cornet Van Rensburg was at once communicated with. By the time be had given his instructions and had the horses saddled the natives had succeeded in getting away some distance. They were, however, overtaken, and spoken to in several languages and called on to stop. This they refused to do. Field-cornet Van Rensburg told his men not to shoot and again warned the natives in many Kafir dialects to stop. Instead of doing so, they rushed into a neighbouring plantation. The burghers followed them, and were bombarded with stones, bricks, and other missiles. Even Field-cornet Van Rensburg was struck by a stone. A few shots fell then, and one native was shot. Another native had climbed a high tree, and a shot was fired to make him come down. The shot was never intended to hit him, and, as a matter of fact, it did not hit him, but the native got such a fright that he fell out of the tree, and was hurt somewhat. (Laughter.) That was all that occurred. The natives were rounded up and taken back. If the House was not satisfied that that was the truth, inquiries could easily be made. The story told by the hon. member for Springs certainly was not correct, and he trusted, for the sake of the hon. gentleman, that there was more truth in the other allegations made by him. As to certain excesses which had taken place, which had been referred to by the hon. member for George Town (Mr. Andrews), he regretted them exceedingly, and he could assure the House that, as soon as he noticed what was going on, he had done his utmost to stop the burghers. He hoped, taking the circumstances into consideration, these excesses would soon be forgiven and forgotten. (Hear, hear.) Dealing with the amendment before the House, Mr. Alberts expressed the opinion that, if it was accepted, they did not require an Indemnity Bill at all, and he hoped the Government would not accept it, but would stand by the clause as it was. (Hear, hear.) Good order had been preserved by the burghers, and it was not true that they had run wild amongst the people with rifles in hand. Order had been well preserved, and all that talk about the actions of the burghers had been published with a certain object.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schreiner">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. L. SCHREINER</person> (Tembuland)</from>

<p>said he wanted to say a few words about the case of the natives which had been referred to. A question had been asked by the hon. member for Weenen (Mr. Meyler) about that matter, and a reply had been given by the Government, from which it appeared that inquiries had been held in the matter, and that the papers had been forwarded by the Public Prosecutor to the Attorney-General for decision; and that the Government promised to lay on the Table of the House the evidence taken at and result of such inquiries. On the whole, the thought the reply of the Government was satisfactory, considering that there had been Martial Law, and they knew that those things did take place, that there was disorder, and the hon. member for, Standerton had shown that certain people might act too hastily, and that bloodshed might occur. When he said that he was in favour of indemnity being given, he included these acts too. He regretted that the value of the lives of the natives in this country were not considered by some people of the same value as the lives of white men, but he saw no reason on that account to unite with those who refused to give indemnity to the Government because of those events. While they regretted some of these events, sad and deplorable as they were, they should not put an amendment into the Bill such as had been moved. Proceeding, he said that there had been an attempt made to rouse racial feelings between Dutch and British owing to occurrences in Benoni and Boksburg; but to attempt in that house, and in that country, to rouse racial feeling was infinitely worse and a greater sin than anything which had happened. They saw Mr. Bain in England doing the same thing, trying to rouse racial feeling, but Dutch and British were united in the determination to put down Syndicalism.</p>

<p>Referring to the amendment, he said it did not seem right to him to put the duty on to the Court of Appeal to make a recommendation for Parliament to consider. He could not agree with that at all. It was possible that the House might think it was necessary that a Compensation Bill should be brought in. When he thought of compensation he backed up what the hon. member for Troyeville said. It was the people who had their houses burned over their heads at Benoni who ought to be compensated. If there was such a Bill it ought to go back to the happenings of July. Those people should be compensated, because they attempted to do right. It was a big question, however; there would be a great amount of compensation claimed, and when they heard what Martial Law had cost, the whole country would feel that they had better pull in their horns and not allow claims for compensation.</p>

The other matter mentioned by the hon. member for Springs he had not heard of before. He was dealing with the admitted cases of the shooting of three natives under Martial Law. He hoped the hon.

<p>referred to the remarks of the hon. member for Tembuland, whose sincerity he said no one could doubt in matters of that sort, but he was far too easily pleased. The hon. member was quite satisfied because the Government had sent the papers to the Attorney-General; but once the Government was indemnified against those acts the paper might just as well be in the waste-paper basket for all the good it would do. Proceeding, Mr. Meyler said it was the absolute duty of that House to insist upon getting some information about the shooting of those people. He was glad there were no other cases of shooting, except that of a trooper accidentally killed. They might possibly have had many more. It was only fair to see that in a Parliament in a British Dominion&#x2014;</p>

<p>Continuing, he said that he understood that a deputation from the native people was going to England to put before the Government certain grievances they had, amongst other things that members of their race had been shot unnecessarily. On Saturday next the personnel was to be chosen and arrangements made. They were asked to indemnify against the shooting at Jaggersfontein but no papers had been laid before that House. All they had heard was that statement of an official of the Native Affairs Department. It was a serious matter, and he hoped the hon. Minister would not compel him to bring his amendment forward dealing with one individual. He honed the hon. Minister would give a proper explanation in regard to those alleged atrocities. He wanted to be satisfied because he was anxious to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<speech by="#andrews">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. ANDREWS</person> (George Town)</from>

<p>said he was as surprised as the hon. member for Weenen at the easy way in which the hon. member for Tembuland was satisfied when a native was killed. The hon. member appeared to arrogate to himself the right to be the only member in that House who had the interest of the natives at heart, and he frequently twitted the hon. members on the cross-benches, if they did venture to interfere in the region of native policy, with hostility, and practically accused them of hypocrisy, because they ventured to say sometimes that they thought the natives were not treated as they ought to be on all occasions. The speaker next referred to the hon. member on the back benches who had said the use of the sjambok on the backs of the natives was the best way to treat them. (Hon. Members: No, no he did not say anything of the sort.) In that case he (Mr. Andrews) would apologise to the hon. member, but he was informed that he had said something that would bear that construction. Whether he said so or not, the speeches of hon. members on that side of the House in his experience of Parliament led him to believe that it was their opinion, that the natives should be hewers of wood and drawers of water. In spite of the fair words of the hon. member for Tembuland, and in spite of what he said, he was as anxious to play up to the capitalist outlook as, any hon. member in-that House. If a native could have sat in that House that afternoon and have heard the feeble remarks of the hon. member, made in defence of one of their race who had been foully done to death on the Rand during that Martial Law business, he would hesitate before using his influence to put the hon. member into that House. The hon. member for Germiston, alluding to the round up in Germiston in January, had said that the Germiston incidents had been explained to some extent. George Town was a part of the Germiston Municipality, and he (Mr. Andrews) was not satisfied with what had been called an explanation on the part of the Minister of Defence. He believed the hon. Minister would give a further explanation of those particular incidents. He might call them regrettable incidents&#x2014;a term that was much in evidence 14 years ago. He (the speaker) did not intend to go into the round-up of the 15th January in Germiston; what he was anxious for was not to have an inquiry into that incident alone, but into all incidents which occurred during Martial Law or even immediately prior to the proclamation of Martial Law. Proceeding, he said he wanted to remind the Prime Minister that his son was in Germiston during that affair, and was, to put it mildly, afflicted with an excess of zeal. He would read the answer to a complaint which was sent, he believed, to Lord Gladstone, by a lady in Germiston, Miss E. Parker, regarding women being treated in the way they ought not to be. There was a formal answer, and a letter from Major Kemp, dated 2nd February, 1914, stating in reply to Miss Parker&#x2019;s letter, that General Botha&#x2019;s son <span class="col_781-782" refersTo="page_0397"/>was never in plain clothes during the period referred to.</p>

<speech by="#andrews">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. ANDREWS</person> (George Town),</from>

<p>proceeding, again read the letter which the lady had received from the Department of Defence signed by Major Kemp, which was as follows: &#x201C;Madam,&#x2014;I am in receipt of your further letter of the 26th inst., and in reply I must inform you that General Botha&#x2019;s son was never in plain clothes. Your statement is, therefore, beside the truth. That the burghers were ill-treating any English people is certainly incorrect, and your report to Lord Gladstone is welcome, so that the world may know that your information is without foundation.&#x201D; It was not of particular interest to the people of Germiston to know that General Botha&#x2019;s son was not in mufti. That was not the question to which he wished to direct the attention of the Committee. The point of this letter was the statement made by Major Kemp that the burghers, during the roundup on January the 15th, did not ill-treat the people. That statement was incorrect. Nobody in that House had denied the statement that had been made that the burghers ill-treated the citizens of Germiston generally. That was the point he wished to make. The Minister of Defence said the other day that if there were any complaints against officers or men of the Defence Force, there might or could be a departmental inquiry. But how much confidence could they repose in a departmental inquiry, when they found a major, the Control Officer in that particular district, making such a statement as this, which he (Mr. Andrews) knew of his own knowledge was incorrect. From personal observation, he knew it was incorrect. They, on those Benches, thought these things should be made public&#x2014;that the people of the country should know what had been taking place&#x2014; and they were surprised that that Committee was apparently willing, with little discussion, to pass this clause, in order to give indemnity to the Government, without knowing anything more about the things that took place under Martial Law, prior to Martial Law, and in districts where Martial Law was not carried into effect. They wanted the information placed before the House and before the country. There was another point in connection with the working of Martial Law to which he would like to draw attention. They had heard a lot about the committees of public safety. He thought that term was used during the French Revolution, and it was strange that a party that was going to nut down a revolution and a conspiracy should give that revolutionary name to bodies whose duty it was to maintain law and order. He wished the Minister to explain that every man, without exception, who served on those committees belonged to one particular class of the community&#x2014;they were either Nationalists or Unionists. They knew what that meant.</p>

<p>In Germiston&#x2014;hon. members might smile when he made the remark&#x2014;he was never asked to sit on that Committee of Public Safety. He wanted to know why&#x003F; Was he such an undesirable&#x003F;</p>

<p>That is my point. Continuing, he asked why was he, as member for George Town, having been given the confidence of the majority of the people, not asked to sit on that committee&#x003F; Then there were three members of the Germiston Town Council, who sat there in the interests of the Labour Party&#x2014;he knew that one was in gaol for political reasons. There was Spencer and Van der Lingen&#x2014;a good Dutch name, and one that should appeal to the Minister. The latter would have rendered quite as valuable service as Mr. Beit, who was well known to the hon. member for Germiston, and Mr. McAllister, who was giving out or refusing passes as he chose. He asked why these men were not considered fit to sit on the Committee of Public Safety. Members talked about class bias&#x2014;they saw class bias and tyranny throughout the whole of the affair that took place last January. He was glad to say he was able to refrain from suffering an indignity by going to that Committee of Public Safety, who were his political opponents, and asking for a pass. When this round-up took place, Mr. Van der Lingen and another Dutchman&#x2014;who had been the finest driver in Germiston and who had been victimised&#x2014;were kept back when all the other people, including Mr. Brammer, Unionist member on the Provincial Council, were released. Mr. White, who was a member of the Provincial Council and a town councillor, told Van der Lingen that he ought to be kept there altogether. He (Mr. Andrews) asked what right he had to say such a thing&#x2014;to be insulted by this man who had been temporarily put into office. That was typical of what took place, and the common expression was &#x201C;We are top dog now, and we are going to rub it into you,&#x201D; and then that Committee was asked to pass the clause without discussion. They might not have the House behind them, but they had a large proportion of the population in this country.</p>

<heading>THE DYNAMITE RETURNS.</heading>

<p>He had also been amused, along with the hon. member for Springs, at this piece of evidence which had been placed before the House, and which, he believed, had been made use of in the British House of Commons, viz., the return of secret outrages committed or attempts to commit outrages <span class="col_783-784" refersTo="page_0398"/>by explosives. Any one who was in the least familiar with the Witwatersrand knew perfectly well, he knew perfectly well that if he got a dozen or twenty men to search the Reef from Randfontein to Springs he could find any number of &#x201C;secret outrages&#x201D; of this character. (Labour cheers.) Dynamite, unfortunately, was used somewhat carelessly. It was no uncommon thing on dumps to find pieces of dynamite, pieces of fuse, detonators and things of that kind. If the Minister of Mines knew half as much about what went on on the Reef as he (Mr. Andrews) did, he would know that this particular evidence was not worth the paper it was written on. He was extremely sorry that the Minister had troubled to put this return on the table. What verification had the Committee got that these pieces of dynamite were placed where they were alleged to be found and who put them there &#x003F; Remembering the Whittaker case and what they had read of it in the courts of the United States, they had a right to suspect that some of the under-strappers, the subordinates in the Department of Justice or some other department, might have been a little over-zealous and might have exceeded their instructions. The Committee should not put very much credence on this piece of evidence. He would like inquiries to be made into every one of these items. He would ask the Minister whether he would, for the benefit of the country, make the people who made these statements prove them before an impartial court. He would support the amendment of the hon. member for Springs.</p>

<p>He did not care for this indemnity at all, he was against the whole clause, but at the same time, if they had to swallow this thing let them make it as little objectionable as possible. He thought the indemnity should be confined to any district or area placed by Proclamation 19 of 1914 under Martial Law. He did not think they had any right to indemnify the Government for any illegal acts committed before that proclamation, at any rate. He had a very lively recollection of his friend Wade, Town Councillor of Germiston, and excellent citizen, being arrested. Along with himself and Mr. Nield, of the Railway Association, this gentleman attended a meeting of railwaymen in the hotel at George Town, where they made certain speeches. A day or two afterwards two detectives were sent after him, he was taken to the Police Office and told he had got 21 days&#x2019; imprisonment. He was not even told what the offence was. The same thing happened to Poutsma, and also, he believed, to Waterston. He was not prepared to vote for giving the Government an indemnity for things of that kind, though he was quite well aware that it was useless to appeal to the Committee not to pass this clause.</p>

<p>said he did not agree with those members of the Committee who thought that this clause should not be carefully considered, and that it should be passed by the Committee. The only important clauses in the Bill were the one they were now considering, which proposed to give complete indemnity to the Government, and clause 4, which dealt with the deportations. On his first reading of clause 2 he was rather disposed to swallow the whole thing, but, after listening to some of the speeches, he was not so anxious to take the clause as it stood.</p>

<heading>OPPORTUNITY FOR REDRESS WANTED.</heading>

<p>He entirely agreed with the majority of the members of the House who were anxious to indemnify the Government for the acts done by them under Martial Law. He was most anxious that the Government and the officers of the Government who acted bona fide and in good faith should be indemnified for the acts committed by them while Martial Law was in existence, but, so far as he was able to gauge the sense of the Committee from the speeches already made, he felt convinced that there were a large number of thinking men in that House who considered that, while they should give an indemnity to the officers of the Government, they should if possible provide some machinery, some loop-hole, by which men who had been treated, not fairly, but unjustly, should have an opportunity of obtaining redress. (Hear, near.) Members on that side of the House, many of whom, he knew, had come prepared to support the Government through thick and thin in this thing should remember that these things were coming home to roost by-and-by. He had given considerable thought to the framing of some kind of an amendment which would meet the case, but he confessed frankly that he found it exceedingly difficult. The clause as it stood made it almost impossible for people who had been badly treated, people whose claims would be admitted, he believed, unanimously by this Committee if they knew the facts, to obtain any redress. As to Chester&#x2019;s case, assuming that his statements were correct, he ventured to say, with all due respect to the opinion of the Minister of Justice, that this man might not be able to obtain any kind of redress. For him to obtain redress under this clause it would be necessary to show want of good faith on the part of officers of the Government.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="want_of_good_faith">

<heading>&#x201C;WANT OF GOOD FAITH.&#x201D;</heading>

<p>A clause should be framed giving an opportunity to those members of the public who had suffered loss and injury, but who were unable to show want of good faith on the part of the officers, to claim redress. The amendment of the right hon. member for Victoria West merited the serious attention of the House. Some simple machinery should be set up, consisting of either a judge or a commission, to which people who felt aggrieved should be able to appeal, and after they had made out a prima facie case they should be entitled to <span class="col_785-786" refersTo="page_0399"/>redress. Although he was not going to press Government to appoint such a commission, a number of very gross cases had been submitted as to what had been done under Martial Law. He understood Government did not intend to appoint a commission to inquire into what had been done under Martial Law, and that being so, it was not asking too much to request that some simple machinery, such as he had indicated, should be set up. The onus of showing the want of good faith rested on the applicant, and it was almost impossible to prove that in a court of law. (Cheers.) The Committee by adopting the words &#x201C;good faith &#x201D; might be led astray. It was almost impossible in actual practice, no matter how hard the case might be, for a person to produce evidence to prove want of good faith, which meant, fraud, malice, or something akin to that on the part of a Government officer. He felt certain that his hon. friends on the Treasury benches must be in a better position than any member of the Committee to frame such a clause as he had indicated. (Hear, hear.)</p>

<p>said that 98 per cent. of the dynamite taken from the Rand mines had been removed with malicious intent. If dynamite explosions on the Rand had been so common as the hon. member for George Town would have the House to believe, he (Dr. Macaulay) would have heard of them, but during an experience of 14 years he had never heard of a case of an explosion of dynamite in a mortar box. He would like to protest against the aspersions which had been cast on the police and Defence Forces from the cross-benches. (Hear, hear.) He had seen many strange things happen in Johannesburg, but if anyone had told him that he would welcome the burghers to defend his liberties he would have said &#x201C;Nonsense.&#x201D; But during the recent troubles he welcomed them, and he had never seen a better behaved lot of men in his life. The men from Lichtenburg and Ermelo were not dressed as household troops, but they behaved themselves as soldiers and gentlemen. (Hear, hear.) Hon. members on the cross-benches had tried to convince the House that dynamite was scattered about by these people in order to throw suspicion on the strikers; that was a calumny on the burghers which was quite in keeping with what was said from the cross-benches.

<speech by="#alexander">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. ALEXANDER</person> (Cape Town, Castle)</from>

<p>said he was not prepared to vote against the clause, but he would point out that it was very rare that actions committed under Martial Law had been indemnified without steps being taken to find out whether individual cases of hardship had followed from its administration. The Government had indicated that thes inquiry instituted into, the July disturbances had been of the greatest value to them.</p>

<p>Why should not those same judges, or other judges, inquire into the execution of Martial Law or its administration&#x003F; It was not an unusual thing. If the Government still thought that there was no precedent, he would like to refer to the precedents of that country. In 1900, when the war had been at its height, and when the Indemnity and Special Tribunal Bill had been brought forward, the war was still going on&#x2014;the war which had split the country in twain, and when feeling was at its height and very bitter. It had been possible in 1900 for the Government of that day to come to the House, and under the Act of Indemnity, establish a special tribunal for offences of a political character, and in the same Bill to provide for a commission to go not merely into the administration of Martial Law, but all losses which the war had caused to persons in that country. The war had gone on; and it had been found that the commission which had sat and inquired into that matter, had in many cases rejected, claims for compensation for losses sustained during the war; but they had a different majority in those days in the House to the one they had today. The Government in 1902 was the Government of the late Sir Gordon Sprigg, and had not been the Government of the present Minister of Mines, the Minister of Railways and Harbours, or the Minister of Agriculture. The Government had brought forward the War Losses Compensation Act of 1904, when Dr. Jameson had been Prime Minister. The proposal made was that because the War Losses Compensation Commission, which had sat and adjudicated, had rejected a large number of claims, it was only fair that a number of claims should be re-opened. Parliament had agreed to that inquiry, and allowed these compensation claims to be re-opened, and as a result, thousands of people obtained redress. That was the spirit in which the matter had been dealt with after a war which had split the whole country in twain and where brother had fought against brother. Here, where Martial Law had only lasted a short time, and there had not been many acts so that the compensation could not be very large, the Government turned a stony heart to the appeal to have some sort of inquiry made into the administration of Martial Law. What bad the Government to lose by granting that request for an inquiry&#x003F; Surely, judges of the Supreme Court could be trusted to present a fair report to that House! If there had been a dozen cases of hardship, why should these cases not be put before judges of the Supreme Court&#x003F; It did not conclude the matter; but it gave men who thought they had great grievances an opportunity of going to the judges and saying: &#x201C;Here and there I suffered under Martial Law.&#x201D; If the complaints were frivolous, the judges would say so in their report, and if there had been hard cases the judges would say so in their report. The only case they could bring an action for was if an officer <span class="col_787-788" refersTo="page_0400"/>had acted out of spite&#x2014;if a man believed he was doing right he was protected. If they protected &#x201C;acts of good faith&#x201D; they protected all acts. The case which would be brought up under Martial Law was if a man had suffered under Martial Law. If the Cape Colony could pay an enormous sum as compensation for war losses, surely the Union could pay a comparatively small sum as compensation for acts committed under Martial Law. The amendments which had been moved did not, in his opinion, seem to be going the right way of setting about it. He (Mr. Alexander), as a private member, could not propose the appointment of a commission, because the Chairman would rule him out of order, as it involved additional expenditure. He hoped that the Government would have an inquiry, for it would not only be just but generous. Do let them give a man an opportunity of bringing his grievances before two judges of the Supreme Court; and that would satisfy everybody except a small minority.</p>

For the rest, however, he could not see eye to eye with the hon. member (Mr. Alberts), and he held the Government should accept the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Smithfield (General Hertzog). The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be to strengthen the Government&#x2019;s prestige.</p>

<p>Where were all the civil actions coming from which the hon. member (Mr. Alberts) feared if the irregularities were so trifling as the hon. member had stated &#x003F; It looked as if the Government were afraid to let the things done under Martial Law be submitted to inquiry.

<p>said that the hon. member had overlooked one thing which should be borne in mind. Every citizen of the Union who had suffered hardship could come to the High Court of Parliament with a petition. There were, no doubt, many cases of extreme hardship suffered by citizens of the Union, which had been brought about by persons ill-disposed to the State. If matters were dealt with entirely separately, if separate chapters were provided for compensation of people in the Indemnity Act, the same thing would have to be done. There would have to be special and very elaborate machinery provided. If they were going to allow special claims to be made for acts which had taken place under Martial Law, that would be doing a great injustice to those who suffered hardship through the-lawlessness which took place in July last year. Unless the Government was going further, and going to see that something was done to compensate all people whose property was destroyed, and whose bodies were damaged in July, he could not see his way to vote for the clause which was then before the House. Everybody was still entitled to come to Parliament with a petition.</p>

<p>said the suggestion which had been made by the hon. member was just such a one as they expected from him. Those petitions would have to be made to a private member, who would put it down for consideration on the following Tuesday, and on the last Tuesday of the session it would be still waiting to be considered. The two matters were not on all fours at all. There had been no suggestion that they should close the courts to those who suffered in July. Because some people had suffered in an earlier stage and were not able to obtain redress through the courts, they were going to say to those who had suffered since that they were not going to give them an opportunity for getting redress. Proceeding, Mr. Creswell said he had listened to the hon. member for Barberton, but as he was not a lawyer, he could only admit that that long amendment of the hon. member for Smithfield seemed rather heavy. It seemed to him that it was as easy to take-a claim before an Appeal Court as before any other court.</p>

<p>He would like to have the opinion of the Court of Appeal as to whether Martial Law was justifiable, and what measures were justifiable, not to maintain law and order, but to force men back to work. The Government had introduced a totally new principle into the government of the country, a principle new to the civilised world, and what attracted him in the amendment was whether they would have the opinion of the Court of Appeal as to what acts were justifiable and what were necessary for the objects for which Martial Law was ostensibly <span class="col_789-790" refersTo="page_0401"/>proclaimed. Had the Minister of Justice the effrontery still to say to that House that not a single man had been made to work&#x003F; If he did still hold that opinion, was he, then, not willing to submit the point to the Court of Appeal, or did he not want to let the world know that the object of the Proclamation of Martial Law, or at least nine-tenths of the object, was to force men who did not want to work to go back to work&#x003F;</p>

<p>He (Mr. Creswell) would be gratified if the Minister of Justice would spare a few minutes of his valuable time to have his attention called to an answer which he gave two or three days ago to a question asked by one of the hon. members on the cross-benches with regard to the constable A311, a reply in which he stated that an inquiry had been held, and that it had been found there was no truth in the allegations made. That inquiry was one of the type of departmental inquiries of which they were getting tired. The hon. member proceeded to read an ex parte statement contained in a letter from an entirely different source from the statement previously quoted. The letter stated that on Friday, the 16th January, the police visited that Arcade and arrested 62 persons. Several policemen committed acts of brutality towards ladies and gentlemen in the Arcade, and one policeman struck three ladies and used filthy language. He also dragged two gentlemen who were having tea, out of the Arcade. The letter went on to detail the way in which that individual appeared to have run amok. He had only read the letter after he had heard the evidence from a different quarter. The Minister said that Colonel Truter had made an inquiry and found there was nothing in it. Under this Bill every person ill-used should be able to bring the man up for assault. It was all nonsense to say that because Martial Law was in force he was protected. The police had to behave like other people. On one occasion when he was in a public street, a policeman put the butt of a rifle into his stomach. That was the way the Minister&#x2019;s people behaved.</p>

<p>supported the amendment of the hon. member for Smithfield, but thought the onus of proof should not rest on the applicant, but on the defendant. Most people were agreed that something would have to be done for those who had suffered injury, but they all seemed alarmed at the length of the amendment <span class="col_791-792" refersTo="page_0402"/>which had been moved, and it had even frightened the hon. member for Jeppe. It would be most difficult for the plaintiff to prove that the Government had not acted in good faith. The Minister of Defence had said it would take the Court of Appeal years to go into all these cases. That argument had rather frightened him (the speaker), because it gave him the impression that very many wrongful acts had been committed. The argument only strengthened the case against the Government. Surely, he said, the Government need not be afraid of a Commission of Inquiry. There were undoubtedly people who had suffered injuries, and he thought the wrongs of these people should be redressed, and the costs in this connection should be borne by the whole country.

The speaker was also a supporter of the Government&#x2014;(hear, hear)&#x2014;but on his side of the House there had been so many bombs exploded that he did not know where he stood. The hon. member for Durban, Berea, had said that things had been done by the Government which would not bear the light of day. In that case an inquiry was most necessary. Proceeding, he urged the necessity of Government carefully inquiring into all wrongs. In the past when they had had Martial Law they had the opportunity of going to a court of inquiry with their grievances. Why should not the same right be given them now&#x003F; It had been suggested that certain acts had been committed which would not bear the light of day. He (Mr. Wessels) did not wish that stigma to rest on the Government, and that was another reason why he wanted an inquiry. He could not agree with the members of the Labour Party, nor with their sentiments; but there must surely be some truth in all their complaints. They could still remember what Martial Law was in the time of the war, what a number of complaints there were, and how many tears were then shed. A court of inquiry had been set up then in order to examine the claims for compensation. As to the remarks of the Minister of Defence, it seemed to him that the Minister was making a mountain out of a mole hill. In the past they had clamoured for an inquiry, and they had got it. The Free Staters had then held a congress in order to draw up a statement of grievances to be laid before the British Government. Those grievances were pooh-poohed, and he personally had felt indignant at the remarks of the authorities on the subject. Today they might think themselves top-dog. If they were strong, it behoved them to be generous. The day might come when they would again require the votes of the labouring classes to get into power, and then they might be sorry. The Court of Appeal proposed in the amendment was not suitable, and the people would prefer to leave it alone. That should be prevented.</p>

<p>said if he had wished to support an amendment of this kind he would have voted against the second reading of the Bill. Did the hon. member know that the effect of the amendment, if accepted, might be a recurrence of the troubles they had just had, because all the deportees would be able to return&#x003F; As to the prestige of the Government, he thought it certainly would not be strengthened if the deportees were allowed to come back. The hon. member for Bethlehem had not said what amendment he intended to vote for, and seemed very quickly to have forgotten his constituents, who, he had said, had instructed him to support the Government on the subject. The hon. member for Kroonstad said he wanted to support the honour of the Government, but did he not know that if the amendment were agreed to, not only the Government, but the whole people, would be made ridiculous&#x003F; He would never agree to permit the men who had been proved to be the sworn enemies of South Africa to return to the country.</p>

<p>Well, the hon. member certainly gave the Committee to understand that that was his opinion. Continuing, General Hertzog said, as to the prestige of the Government being weakened by his amendment, he wished to ask the hon. member whether he would sooner see a great wrong committed to any number of people, if he wished to see these men exiled for ever without being able to have a fair trial, simply because he did not wish the Government&#x2019;s prestige to be weakened&#x003F; The hon. member had posed as if on this question he represented the feeling of the Free State. He (General Hertzog), however, was prepared on this point to meet the hon. member&#x2019;s own constituents on the same platform as the hon. member himself. He (General Hertzog) denied that the hon. member represented the feeling of the Free State on the subject. Did he think that the Free State was prepared to banish these people for <span class="col_793-794" refersTo="page_0403"/>ever without a trial&#x003F; He (General Hertzog) had felt it his duty to try and do something that was right to everyone who had suffered during recent events, not only to the deportees, but to everyone concerned. But in this case they could see the results of the caucus. If there was freedom of thought and speech, the hon. member for Winburg would be the first to say that deportation was such an extreme punishment that it could not be allowed without trial. The hon. member was a faithful supporter of the Government, but he did not represent the Free State. The amendment only proposed to compensate for direct losses, and to afford an opportunity for bringing forward claims which otherwise did not exist. If the terms of his amendment did not meet with the approval of the Government, he would ask them to propose some amendment of their own, so as to meet these people who had suffered injury or damage. If they did so he would be quite prepared to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p>denied having said that he represented the feeling of the Free State. He knew, however, that the general opinion had been expressed that these men should be sent away. He, for one, did not want to see them back, and neither did the country. (Hear, hear.) These people were sworn enemies of the South African community, and should not be allowed here. (Cheers.) Why did the hon. member for Smithfield make that personal attack&#x003F; The caucus had never discussed the subject. The members of the commandos were in favour of deportation, as they did not want to be called up every six months.</p>

<speech by="#kuhn">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. G. KUHN</person> (Prieska)</from>

<p>said he had hoped the Government would have made some provision to meet the people who had suffered injuries or damage, and on that understanding he had voted for the second reading. He wished the Minister to make some statement to that effect, as otherwise he could not vote for this clause. It was not right that people should be expected to suffer without any chance of compensation, and he asked the Government not to close the door in that respect. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Smithfield was too complicated. Still, the Government ought to hold an inquiry of some sort, because many unjust things had been done under Martial Law which must be inquired into and put right. The people approved of what had been done, but they must have justice.</p>

<p>said he was sorry the hon. member for Smithfield (General Hertzog) had put something at the end of his amendment which made it practically useless, to his (Mr. Boy-dell&#x2019;s) mind. The hon. member had got in his amendment that the judges should refer their recommendations to members of that House, and if that were done, they would know what would happen. When the Minister of Defence had said on the previous day that when officers had exceeded their duty he would have some inquiry made, he (Mr. Boydell) thought at the time that the Minister was favourable to an inquiry being made. The Minister of Defence had been an interesting psychological study, because the stronger an agrument was made in favour of having an inquiry, the stronger appeared to be his determination that he was not going to have one.</p>

<speech by="#boydell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOYDELL</person></from>

<p>went on to say that they were asked under that clause to indemnify the Government for &#x201C;acts of good faith,&#x201D; and he submitted that there had been three motives which had actuated the officers: firstly, where they had acted in good faith to prevent any violence and disorder, and in that connection all hon. members on the cross-benches would, he thought, indemnify the Government. But, secondly, there were other acts which had been committed for the specific purpose of preventing the men from conducting their legitimate organising work in connection with the strike. Those acts they could prove by much evidence, and these acts had been prompted by the Government determining to smash up the men&#x2019;s organisations and so put an end to the strike. The third motive had been where individuals, who had been invested with large military power, had lost control over themselves, and had outraged many innocent people whom they were supposed to protect. Dealing with the second motive, he would refer the Minister to the cases of Mr. Tole and Mr. McKerrell, in Natal. The Minister had told them that Martial Law had been proclaimed in Natal to protect the main line, but by the proclamation of Martial Law in Natal the Minister of Defence had been enabled to kidnap two men, who had come down from Johannesburg to Natal to assist the miners in Natal in regard to the coal strike, which was then going on. He defied the Minister to show that either Tole or McKerrell had been guilty of any act of violence or incitement to violence. Tole had been imprisoned for a fortnight in Johannesburg, and had been released without a word of explanation whatever. He thought the Minister of Defence would find it hard to deny that it was on his direct instructions that these two men had been arrested in Natal. The hon. member went on to deal with the case of Richardson, a signalman in Natal, who had been sentenced to twelve months&#x2019; hard labour for committing what apparently in the eyes of the authorities had been a most heinous crime&#x2014;for not doing anything whatever. Richardson, <span class="col_795-796" refersTo="page_0404"/>after his release, had told him (Mr. Boydell) that the night after he had been arrested he had been taken to the office of one of the &#x201C;military tyrants,&#x201D; and there were four witnesses&#x2014;railway officials&#x2014;to give evidence against him. But he had had no opportunity of bringing in witnesses to defend himself. This officer said: &#x201C;I will sentence you to 12 months&#x2019; hard labour and make an example of you, so that strikers will know what Martial Law is.&#x201D; That, said Mr. Boydell, was an illustration of the acts of supposed good faith done by the military authorities. As the hon. member for Jeppe said, it had been stated that not a single man was forced to work, but those men were practically told that if they did not get back to work they would be liable to be sentenced to 12 months&#x2019; hard labour. In the other case the man was sentenced to 6 months&#x2019; hard labour for a very small offence.</p>

<p>But the point in that case was that this military authority who convicted him said he was going to make an object lesson of him, and he also volunteered the information to the man that he would have him (Mr. Boydell) arrested. This was before he had committed any crime whatever. That was before he (the speaker) was arrested. He had not been doing anything to promote violence. On the contrary, if the hon. Minister would make inquiries from the Chief Magistrate or Control Officer he would find that they had thanked him (Mr. Boydell) many times for the assistance he had given them in administering Martial Law in Natal with as little friction as possible. That particular military authority to whom he had referred had gone beyond the bounds of all ordinary decency. Was he (Mr. Boydell) going to be a party to indemnify the Government for acts done like those, acts which wore intended to crush the strike by putting innocent men in gaol&#x003F; How was it possible for any hon. member in that House, knowing the circumstances, to entertain the slightest idea of indemnifying the Government for such acts.</p>

<p>He would like to call the attention of the Minister of Defence that on the morning that he was supposed to have committed a crime in the afternoon, there appeared in the English Press the information that he was to be arrested. This military despot, who did not know how to regulate his own actions, had evidently given the information which appeared in the Home Press. It was 24 hours after that that the arrest was made. That secret official information, as the hon. member for Jeppe had just said, had evidently leaked out.</p>

<heading>MORE DEPORTATIONS.</heading>

<p>Mr. Boydell referred to what he described as an important matter about which he did not know anything until he carne down to the House that evening at 8 o&#x2019;clock. It showed the country what was going on even now under Martial Law regulations. At 8 o&#x2019;clock that evening he was called out of the House of Assembly to interview a man in the Lobby. That man told him that he had travelled down in the train with two men, one from Johannesburg and one from Durban, who were being deported for crimes which they had not been told anything about and of which they knew nothing. He (Mr. Boydell) had asked to have their sworn affidavits sent to him, and promised when he received them he would take what steps he could. According to his information, these men had never been in gaol. There appeared to be a deportation mania. Neither of the men had had the opportunity of telling their wives and families what had become of them. They had no chance of going to their homes to get clothing or anything else. They were arrested last Wednesday without any charge being preferred against them and at the present time were on some boat or other down at the Docks waiting to be deported to Australia. He (Mr. Boydell) did not know the facts of the case, but was just relating what had been told to him. The man who made the statement seemed to be somewhat excited, and said that the two men had asked him to see what could be done. One of these men was named Casey, a miner, and the other a man named White. The latter had been a printer in Durban for 18 years and had never been in gaol and had never had a charge preferred against him. Yet according to this statement he was being deported without one word of explanation. One would have thought that it was not possible that any Government or their officers could be responsible for such dealings as were shown in this case, provided what had been stated was true. He (Mr. Boydell) supposed that was one of the acts that that Bill would include when it was passed, acts done in good faith to prevent disorder and violence. If there was any trouble afterwards it was easy to say that the men were deported under that particular clause. He would be glad if the hon. Minister would make some explanation as to why these two men were being deported.</p>

<speech by="#vermaas">

If there was any truth in these allegations hon. members on the cross-benches themselves <span class="col_797-798" refersTo="page_0405"/>were the responsible parties, and he hoped the day would come when a good many more of these agitators would be deported. (Hear, hear.) As to the amendment proposed by General Hertzog, it seemed to him that it was the intention of the hon. member, who had not voted either for the first or second reading, to break up this Bill and render it valueless, and he hoped the Government would not accept it. If the Government complied with the demand for an inquiry, large sums of money would have to be paid out to persons having demands to make, and if the burghers had to be called up again to suppress disturbances the certain result would be a revolution.</p>

<p>said that that afternoon he did not go into the details of the Jagersfontein affair, and he would do so now. Martial Law was not in force the night this happened, and so he did not think they could hold His Excellency responsible. But he thought that the members of the Executive Council could be held responsible, and he would move as a further amendment the deletion of sub-section (b). He had looked up the &#x201C;Cape Times&#x201D; report of the inquiry, and he found that while the European witnesses were agreed that the natives were excited, there was a divergence of opinion as to whether the shooting was necessary. Mr. Ratsey, of the Native Affairs Department, said he thought it unnecessary and that firing overhead would have proved just as effective. It was some time since the papers had been sent to the Attorney-General, and surely these could be laid on the Table. Surely hon. members did not grasp that the clause indemnified everybody connected with the affair at Jagersfontein. The only independent witness was of the opinion that the &#x2019;shooting was not necessary. The Ministry were absolutely callous so far as human life was concerned and was criminally callous when it referred to black people. The Minister had talked about the affair in a flippant manner, and had said that it was providential flashlight on the situation. (Labour cheers.) The Minister had said that the natives invaded the town, but this statement according to the evidence, was not correct. Six of the natives had been shot dead, and 35 were wounded, five of the latter subsequently succumbing. He was not the least surprised to see the Minister smile&#x2014;niggers were only niggers to him. It was remarkable that black people, whom they were supposed to protect, should be treated this way in a British Dominion.</p>

<p>The Protector of Natives was not there, the man on whom the hon. member relies for his information that the shooting was unnecessary. Proceeding, Sir D. Harris said that for four <span class="col_799-800" refersTo="page_0406"/>hours the management endeavoured to pacify these natives without success. The natives set fire to an office in the compound, they broke open the safe, they took all the money that was in it, and they armed themselves with very possible weapon they could lay their hands on. They sang their war songs, and he was told by white men who were there that these natives meant mischief. They smashed down the compound wall and some of the white men who saw the danger rushed to the town to obtain rifles and the people in the town also got possession of their rifles. They knew, if the natives got into the town, what that meant. The hon. member had not said a word about the six white men who were injured. The hon. member wanted to make the Government responsible. The Government knew no more about the matter than the hon. member. The Government were asked to send assistance, but before the Government forces arrived the citizens had protected themselves. The hon. member now got up to defend natives, who, if they had got loose, would have murdered every white man and woman in that town. He had himself thanked some of the residents of the town for their courage in helping the mining people to prevent the natives from getting into the town. These people simply had to defend themselves. The hon. member was merely trying to make a little political capital, and it did not do him any credit.</p>

The hon. member for Weenen was perfectly right. The Prime Minister had absolutely refused to utter one single word in explanation of his desire for an indemnity in regard to the shooting of these 41 natives at Jagersfontein.

<p>said he would endeavour to avoid repeating the arguments of other hon. members, but some of the speeches had been in Dutch, with which he was not familiar. The procedure which had been adopted with regard to that Bill was most extraordinary, and left no loophole for the redress of grievances.</p>

<speech by="#nathan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. NATHAN</person> (Von Brandis)</from>

<p>said surely the hon. member for Smithfield (General Hertzog) would see that if the clause passed with his amendment, it would destroy the whole Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hull">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. C. HULL</person> (Barberton)</from>

<p>said he would not be guilty of using arguments which had been used before. He moved as an amendment, at the end of the clause, to add a new sub-section 4, as follows: &#x201C;Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the Governor-General shall immediately after the taking effect of this Act appoint a commission, consisting of two judges of the Supreme Court, who shall inquire into any case which may be brought before them by any person who feels aggrieved, and who claims that he has suffered injury for or on account of, or in respect of, any act or matter done by any of the persons mentioned in sub-section 1 of the clause: provided, however, that the commission shall not inquire into any case unless the aggrieved person establishes, to the satisfaction of the commission, a prima facie case that the act or matter complained of by him was not done in good faith, or was of such a nature that, although bona fide, was unjustifiable. If the commission be satisfied that according to right and equity restitution or compensation should be made, it shall make such recommendations to Parliament as it may deem right and just. Any claim preferred under the provisions of this sub-section shall be brought within six months after the coming into operation of this Act, failing which the same shall be prescribed. &#x201D;</p>

<p>Proceeding, the hon. member said that he hoped that his proposal was framed so that it could be readily understood by members of the Committee. In supporting the amendment he would say in the first place that he did not propose to put the country to any expense, it was only adding another function to the existing functions of the Supreme Court. The aggrieved person would have to make good one of the alternatives. He would have to make up a prima facie case. He would have to satisfy the commission that his claim rested upon an act not done in good faith or that his claim was of such a nature that although the act was bona fide, it was unnecessary or unjustifiable. Then the commission had to be satisfied that the claim fell outside the Act of Indemnity. If they were satisfied that a prima facie case had been made out and that the claim fell outside the Indemnity Act, then only would the Government have to present their side of the case to the commission, and when the commission had heard both sides they would make recommendation to Parliament for Parliament was the final court. He recommended the appointment of two judges because the Government in connection with the disturbances of July adopted that course. He submitted his amendment would find a way out of the difficulty and give them an opportunity of dealing with the cases such as referred to by the hon. member for Victoria West. He did not think anybody would be able to say that they were shutting their eyes to acts of injustice or were not prepared to appoint a commission of some sort to investigate the grievances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. W. SMARTT</person> (Fort Beaufort)</from>

<p>asked if the hon. Minister would give him some further information before the matter was put. They had had a very sultry discussion during the last four or five hours a great deal of which discussion had not added to the dignity of that House. It <span class="col_803-804" refersTo="page_0408"/>had been a discussion of a personal character, and was such as would have a tendency to bring discredit on the House. He would like to call the attention of the House to the fact that the clause dealt with the indemnifying of the Government for acts done in good faith-That was the position which every hon. member in that House, except, perhaps, those on the cross-benches would endorse. The question was whether there might have been so many cases under the administration of Martial Law in good faith where certain persons had suffered loss that would open up such a large inquiry that it would be a difficult thing to get the House to endorse. As had been said, there were no petitions before the House dealing with matters of that kind, and he would like the hon. Minister to make a statement to the House that where petitions of that kind were laid before the House, the Government would not object to their being inquired into for the possibility of a Select Committee being appointed to inquire into them. He did not see that the House could accept the amendment of the hon. member for Smithfield, or, without the fullest investigation, that of the hon. member for Barberton. He would have thought the best course would be to adopt clause 2, and the hon. member for Barberton should put his amendment on the paper as a new clause. The two should not be dealt with together. He did not think that this was the proper place for it. He thought that the Minister might say he was prepared to meet these eases and some machinery might be evolved. To flood the commission with thousands of cases was a thing which he thought hon. members did not desire. Nobody wished an injustice to be done to anybody, and he did not think that any great injustice had been done. Those people who came out on duty with the Defence Force were also entitled to consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Poutsma and Mr. Bain could also come before the commission and revisit these inhospitable shores. He pointed out that there would be two sets of proceedings before the matter could come before the Government, and then they would have to spend the time of Parliament listening to all these cases. He did not think that it would be business. He pointed out that this was an Indemnity Bill, and that the amendment was not germane to the issue. He did not think that it was workable. As the hon. member for Fort Beaufort had said, they had had no complaints of a serious character. If before that House were brought any serious or substantial complaints in regard to the administration of Martial Law, he thought it would be the duty of the Government and of the House to conduct an inquiry into those cases. Until that had been done they were not going to invite it; they were not going to publish a general invitation to the country to come forward with an endless list of grievances.</p>

<p>My hon. friend does not represent all the opinion on this side of the House. It is a perfectly fair proposition that the amendment should appear on the paper, for it is a most important one.

<p>said he would like to ask if it was relevant to point out that the Minister could not keep a quorum in the House. Continuing, he said the Minister admitted committing a number of illegal acts at Volksrust, and until they had an explanation of those acts, the clause ought not to be agreed to. The Defence Force from the Waterberg district had been called out under the impression that a native rising was imminent. Proceeding, Mr. Creswell said that when once these men had been brought there, the whole authority of the Defence Act was put on them to keep them there. He alluded to the case of Mr. Fry, who &#x201C;refused to shoot down his fellowmen,&#x201D; and was imprisoned in a cell at Marshall-square. What right had the Government to incarcerate Mr. Poutsma, Mr. Nield, and the others, who had not incited to any violence at all; but they were now asked to indemnify the Government for the shady acts they (the Government) had done. The hon. member referred to the silence of the Leader &#x201C;of the so-called Opposition,&#x201D; instead of backing up the efforts of the members on the cross-benches in opposing the Government.</p>

<p>felt they were very much in the dark. The amendments were deserving of close study, but they had not been able to study them; they had to deal with the clause as it stood in the Bill. He went on to acquaint the House with what took place in connection with the revolt at Jagersfontein, and said the action of the Government was a correct one. Jagersfontein was a place where the miners were not wealthy. Fortunately the mining company had provided them with weapons, and they had to thank the company for that provision. The natives had been discontented for some time, and the management had tried to pacify them. They broke out unexpectedly, and if they had been allowed to get into the mining area, there was no telling what might have happened; and if they had got into the town, an appalling massacre would probably have taken place. Every possible precaution was taken to prevent anyone being killed, and it was only as a last measure that firing was resorted to. It is absolutely malicious for any hon. member to suggest that the shooting was reckless. In relation to what took place at Jagersfontein, it was necessary and it was wrong to say it was malicious.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. B. MADELEY</person> (Springs)</from>

<p>said that the cause of the trouble was that one or two of the natives had been so kicked that later they had died. Instead of trying to pacify the natives by treating them with justice, the Government brought up the troops. Was that the way of quieting the natives, who were seething with discontent&#x003F; The burghers had been placed at the disposal of the mine managers. The Government was like a mole, and consistently worked in the dark. They were afraid to have light thrown on the darkness.</p>

<p>went on to deal with the case of Mr. Nield, whom the hon. Minister should have treated better than he did. Had he tried to absorb some of that gentleman&#x2019;s ideas the question of whether they should or should not give the Government indemnity would not have arisen. There was no cause for Mr. Nield&#x2019;s arrest. The reason he was incarcerated was because he offered a solution of the original difficulty, which caused the whole trouble. But the Government did not want a solution. Mr. Nield, in conference with the Minister of Railways and Harbours, together with Mr. Poutsma and another, after all efforts had proved unavailing, Mr. Nield said: &#x201C;If you find it necessary to retrench, order your workshop staff to work one hour less per day.&#x201D;</p>

Then there was the case of Waterston, who was arrested, heaven only knew what for, except that he was a political undesirable from the Minister&#x2019;s point of view. He was arrested because he was secretary of the South African Labour Party. Was it right that the Government should refuse a little information&#x003F; He did not simply refuse, but sat there calmly, and said nothing, and said it well.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. BOYDELL</person> (Durban, Greyville)</from>

<p>wanted to &#x2018;know on what grounds Poutsma and three others were arrested on January 9 if it was not the intention of the Government to smash the railway strike&#x003F; He pointed out that Mr. Poutsma told the railwaymen not to provoke trouble, and started for Johannesburg in order to get the Federation not to call a general strike. Nield was also arrested on the way to Johannesburg. Then the only crime alleged against Buckley and Carnon was that they went on the platform at the Town Hall at the railway meeting because there was no room in the body of the hall. Neither had held any official position in the Railway Society. Now they were asked to indemnify the Government for an act of this description. It was outrageous to think that a Committee of that House would condone such an action. These men were out on bail, and the Government would not dismiss nor reinstate them. The Government said it could not interfere until the court had decided the matter, and the result was that these men were out of employment. The Government was actually taking the bread out of the mouths of their children. At 1.45 a.m. Mr. Boydell detailed the cases of Richardson and Fireman Trevers, the latter being sentenced to six months&#x2019; hard labour before Martial Law came into force. He pointed out that this could only have been done under Martial Law regulations, which only came into force the day after sentence was passed. They could not be expected to indemnify the Government for that act, let alone others that he had mentioned. He would also point out that the maximum sentence under the regulations was one month&#x2019;s hard labour and a fine of &#x00A3;30. He thought that the fireman had a claim for damages against the man who sentenced him, and who had clearly exceeded his powers. If they went through all the Martial Law sentences they would find the next highest was six weeks&#x2019; hard labour. He said they would be false to their trust if they were prepared to condone these acts done between January 8 and the time Martial Law was proclaimed. The worst thing the Government had done was to make allegations against the deportees when they were speeding on their way to England and could not defend themselves. He denied that Mr. Poutsma had been in prison for violence. He had been in for inciting to violence, but under the circumstances he (Mr. Boydell) would have done the same. But if they went into police records, the records of members in that House, let alone the people of the country&#x2014;</p>

It was the members of the cross-benches who were the real Opposition in that House, although the so-called Opposition had been returned on the plea that a strong Opposition was necessary. The country would note what had been done by hon. members. The hon. member alluded to the Waterberg incident, and the false rumours which, he said, had been circulated by the Government about a native rising, because of which the Defence Force had been called out there.

<p>moved, as an amendment, to add at the end of paragraph (ii) of sub-section (1) &#x201C;except the taking by the authorities of certain papers, books, documents and other assets of Trade Unions and the removing of the private papers and correspondence of the S.A. Labour Party.&#x201D;</p>

<p>He complained of the manner in which the Trades Hall had been surrounded, and the books and papers belonging to certain Trade Unions taken away. This was an unwarranted action and likely to cause hardship. He said, that apart from the strikers, there was a certain percentage of unemployed and a book was kept by the Unions which was a check on those members-whom they expect to sign the out-of-work register from day to day. That meant to say, that those men that did not sign the register did not get out-of-work pay owing to the action of the Government. A large number of men, not strikers, had been deprived of their pay. The office of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers was entered and the safe opened: and the books taken away. He hoped the Hon. Minister seing that this was a serious accusation, would give an undertaking that all the documents removed from Trade Union and the Labour Party offices would be handed back to the people they belonged to. Members on the cross-benches would not be pacified until they got an assurance that this would be done.</p>

<p>The charge which the hon. member has just made has been repeated every day&#x2014;that we are in possession of these papers and are keeping them. Inquiry has been made of the police, and I am informed that the books of only two societies were taken, viz., Amalgamated Railway Servants and the Amalgamated Engineers. These were the only societies of which the papers were taken. The books of the Society of Engineers were returned some time ago. The documents and books of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants were returned yesterday. No records or books were taken other than those stated by the police. This statement, continued the Minister, is in respect of the charge that was made that possibly some lists of members of these Unions may have been shown to the mine authorities. No such information was given or lists furnished. There was some papers belonging to the Federation of Trades, but these were in the hands of the Law Department, and were still under consideration, but will be returned in due course. That being so, I do not think there is any necessity for the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Commissioner-street (Mr. Sampson).

<p>said the information just given did not tally with his, but of course the statement they had heard was from the police. He (Mr. Sampson) had his information from <span class="col_823-824" refersTo="page_0418"/>a trustworthy source. They had heard that the Railway Servants and the Engineers&#x2019; Societies had had their books returned. The miners had also their documents sent back, but he knew for a fact that the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, who held two meetings in the Trades Hall had their correspondence taken away. Had that been given back&#x003F;</p>

<p>After the police visit to the Labour Party rooms he missed a book&#x2014;an address book&#x2014;and with his own eyes he saw papers and correspondence taken. He thought that there was room for further inquiry. Why had the offices of these bodies, perfectly legal in the eyes of the law, been raided&#x003F; Was it to supply lists of the members to the employers &#x003F; He referred to the fact that men had been taken on again and worked one shift and then been dismissed because they were members of the Miners&#x2019; Association. It was unfair that men should be dogged this way all their lives, and he said that much of the bitterness on the Rand had been due to the blacklisting after the 1907 strike. He did not think that the Minister should place such implicit reliance on the word of the police. He thought that if these Trade Unions could prove that papers had been taken away and not returned, they should have access to the courts.</p>

<p>There would have been no necessity for the hon. member doing so if he had voted for the adjournment of the debate when it was proposed. I am afraid he is experiencing just a little specimen of real active opposition. Continuing, Mr. Creswell said that the Government, by its actions, had frightened away labour from the country, and declared that the taking away of these papers and books was war against the people whom the Government should have protected. The papers of the Miners&#x2019; Association were taken away. His information was that the office was in the hands of the police for some time, and that the place was thoroughly ransacked. Anyhow, he would prosecute the matter further. The papers of the Trades Federation were taken away, and he understood that these had not yet been returned. The individuals had been taken to Marshall-square Police Station and then to the Fort, where they had been kept for ten days. Then the office of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers had been raided and their papers removed. Why had that been done&#x003F; It was that way in which these underground movements started, and the Minister did not seem to see it. It was said that they (the Labour Party) was in favour of class distinction, in class war, but did not the Minister know it was their object to remove class distinctions&#x003F;</p>

<p>In the whole of the Minister&#x2019;s speech there had not been a word which recognised that the Labour Party was like any other political party: and the Minister should have apologised to the Labour Party for having raided its offices. It was a political outrage. Did the Minister not see what an insult it was&#x003F; Where could the Minister show that they had incited to sedition&#x003F; On the contrary, they had done their utmost during the past six months to prevent incitements to sedition. Those actions of the Ministry tended to drive the people into those devious ways, which they (the Labour members) <span class="col_825-826" refersTo="page_0419"/>wished to prevent. The Minister of Defence was a clever man; but the others were not fools. He had learnt something from the July riots, but so had they. The reason why special constables of their own had been appointed in January was because of the July riots, and they wanted to prevent lawlessness and a sort of debauched riot. Martial Law had simply been against the Trade Unions, and so it was looked upon by the workers of the world&#x2014;a brutal attempt of capital to crush the workers. The attitude of the Prime Minister towards the Labour movement reminded him of a big Newfoundland dog which tried to kill an insect, and tried to put its paw on it, with the result that the insect stung the dog. The Prime Minister did not understand the position or the importance of the movement, or the good which Trade Unions did.</p>

<p>said two men had been incarcerated in Durban gaol, who, being members of the Defence Force, refused to bear arms for the purpose of repressing the strike among the railwaymen. They had been there for a month, and were in the next cell to his, when he (Mr. Boydell) had had the honour of wearing the uniform. The hon. member went on to combat the statement of the Minister of Defence that nothing had been done to interfere with a Labour organisation as such.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ANDREWS</person> continuing,</from>

<p>said he could not say he was in favour of giving indemnity for Martial Law at all. But the amendment had been proposed in order to bring the matter more prominently before the House. It was not the fact that the books and documents had been in the hands of the Government that they objected to. It was the act of taking them. They quite realised that in the Minister&#x2019;s own good time they would return those papers which had been raided. He repeated again: It was the taking that he wished to draw attention to, therefore no part of the Minister&#x2019;s statement touched the point. He (Mr. Andrews) was a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, which had its offices, not in the Trades Hall, but in a respectable quarter, and not only were the papers taken but the members of the Executive Committee. Those six or eight men were quietly discussing how they were to pay the benefits due to its members. It was playing low down, and such an act had never been done by any authority since the inception of the society in 1850. Such action was totally unnecessary in the interests of law and order, and was done in order to break the strike. It succeeded, but whether finally it would be for the benefit of the Minister and his party or for South Africa generally remained to be seen.</p>

<p>hoped the Minister would accept the amendment of the hon. member for Commissioner street.</p>

<p>Continuing, the hon. member went on to say that the membership of the Trade Unions in South Africa, whose offices had been raided, exceeded the whole of the white population of the country&#x2014;men, women and children. Did they think that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers was going to sit down under the insults that had been levelled&#x003F; Not a bit of it. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers&#x2019; executive sat in London; the South African branch was only an outpost. They would move the mother of Parliaments and&#x2014;</p>

<p>said that the other party was slowly growing, and when they reached the top, as they would, he hoped they would be magnanimous to those on the top now. It was a low-down and dirty game that had been played towards the Unions at Johannesburg. The speaker went on to criticise the harshness of the Martial Law regulations which were enforced at Durban, and said it was not right to terrorise men in the way the authorities had done. They should have given the fullest information about the expenditure before they were asked to indemnify the Government. He dealt with the presentation of rifles to burghers, and inquired about the cost.</p>
