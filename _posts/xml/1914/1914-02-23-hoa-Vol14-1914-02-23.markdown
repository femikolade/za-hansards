<speech by="#walton">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. H. WALTON</person> (Port Elizabeth, Central),</from>

<p>who said that in the first place he should like to congratulate the House on the patience which it had exhibited in the course of this discussion, on the wide latitude allowed hon. members in order to discuss every branch, not only of the Bill, but of any subject which remotely touched upon the Bill. It was right that the country should know that they had approached this crisis with calmness, deliberation, with the determination to let every man have his say, to give every possible opportunity to opponents to lay their views before the House, and with the sense of responsibility that they were laying down principles, that they were making history, and that they were creating precedents for future generations in South Africa. They knew that they would be judged by future generations. He only hoped that all of them, while they approached the subject with due seriousness, did it with the determination to do what was right, and that when they came to a decision they would show no weakness, that they would not fail in respect to themselves, or to the country, and that future generations would see that when they were face to face with a crisis they were not afraid to do the right thing. (Hear, hear.) He put it to the House whether the case laid before the House by Ministers justifying the proclamation of Martial Law had been shaken&#x003F; Had the evidence been shaken&#x003F; Some attempts had been made to shake that evidence, mainly by hon. members on the cross-benches. Only the hon. member for Greyville and the hon. member for George Town had stated that there had been violence, and had expressed their regret that it had taken place. There had been violence, but there had been more than violence. There was mob rule. They had evidence on that point, and it had not been shaken. The hon. member for Springs had boasted of the fact that the Strike Committee had run the town of Benoni. After that admission surely it was idle for the hon. member to deny the existence of anarchy. Then, if he remembered rightly, the hon. member for Roodepoort had accused the Minister of trying to mislead the House by adding words to the speech which he attributed to Crawford. He (the speaker) would point out that the Minister had quoted chapter and verse from the report. They had all had the report before them, and they could have followed them.</p>

<p>said that the Minister added the words &#x201C;You who know he use of dynamite,&#x201D; but that was not misleading the House. He put it to the House that that was a fair interpretation of the speech that had been made by Mr. Crawford.</p>

<p>said that he did not know; he was quoting from the official report. These were taken from shorthand notes which had never been questioned. Continuing, he said that would show the shifts to which hon. members on the cross-benches were put. The hon. member for Jeppe said that all the trouble was due to the irritation of the police, whereas the hon. member for Springs said that it was owing to the fact that there were not police there that they ran the town.</p>

<debateSection name="#no_martial_law_in_july">

<heading>NO MARTIAL LAW IN JULY.</heading>

<p>Both statements could not be correct; they could not have the police irritating the people and at the same time have no police. With regard to the reason alleged by the Labour Party for not giving evidence before the Judicial Commission of inquiry, because the judges in this case had given judgment in the case of Whitaker which was reversed on appeal. Well, appeals were frequently successful, that was no reflection on the judges in the lower court whose decisions might be reversed on appeal. (Hear, hear.) The argument that because the sentence of the judges forming the Commission had been reversed they were therefore incompetent to give a fair report on the result of their investigations was very far-fetched. (Hear, hear.) If the men concerned had an opportunity of appearing before the Commission, and if they had an adequate defence against the charges, surely the men would appear before the Commission. It must be remembered that the events in July took place when there was no Martial Law. Whatever reason held the Government back from taking decisive action, it was clear that decisive action should have been taken. He failed to understand why Government did not put larger forces in the field last July. (Cheers.) He had heard it was due to Cabinet differences&#x2014;that certain Ministers were strongly opposed to any decisive action being taken. Possibly, if the late Mr. Sauer were still a live they might have heard from him some explanation of the state of affairs which he (Sir Edgar) failed <span class="col_627-628" refersTo="page_0320"/>to understand. Although Government must accept responsibility for not having taken stronger action in July, their excuse was that they were unaccustomed to deal with such a state of affairs and their inexperience led them into a mistake. As to the Bain-Botha treaty, he thought the gibes of the right hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. Merriman) were rather unworthy of him. The right hon. member took&#x2019; the view that there was no need of any understanding to be arrived at between the Prime Minister and Bain. The hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Hull), who was a military gentleman (laughter)&#x2014;took the same view. The hon. member for Greyville said that if the agreement had not been arrived at a great deal of Johannesburg would have been pulled down. But Mr. Tom Matthews did not agree with the gentleman who said there was nothing in the condition of affairs to warrant the Bain-Botha treaty.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#never_did_a_braver_thing">

<heading>&#x201C;NEVER DID A BRAVER THING.&#x201D;</heading>

<p>He (Sir Edgar) had no doubt whatever that if the Government had declined to come to terms it could have restored order, but the Prime Minister was perfectly right in saying that it would have been at enormous cost. Order could have been restored only by shooting people down, and at the cost of enormous loss of life to the country. (Cheers.) The Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence never did a braver thing than when they faced the unpopularity of signing that agreement. (Hear, hear.) they knew perfectly well that distasteful as the treaty was to them, it would be distasteful and unpopular to the country, but they did a great service to the Union by signing the treaty and thus obtaining an opportunity of getting order restored.</p>

<p>It might be said that although there was trouble in July, there was none in January. The evidence showed that there was continual unrest from July until January, there were continual threats as to what was going to happen next time; there were threats of a class war and also of a revolution. Was it not futile to say, therefore, that there was nothing in January to warrant the calling out of the forces&#x003F; I here was a feeling of relief throughout the country when Martial Law was declared It Government had failed to declare Martial Law and if as the result of its failure there had been an outbreak of violence, the Ministry would not have escaped a vote of censure in that House. (Cheers.) The hon. member for George Town (Mr. Andrews) had stated that the proclamation of Martial Law was for the purpose of suppressing the strike, but that was obviously untrue.</p>

<speech by="#creswell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. H. P. CRESWELL</person> (Jeppe):</from>

<p>Among other regulations were that men on strike were confined to their houses and were forbidden to be given food or money because they wore on strike. *</p>

<heading>JUSTIFIED BY JULY DISORDERS.</heading>

<speech by="#walton">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. H. WALTON</person> (proceeding)</from>

<p>said that the statement was made that the proclamation was issued with this intention. He put it to the country that their justification for Martial Law in January was the condition of things in July, the certainty that unless steps were taken that state of things would be repeated in January. If they went on repeating the statement, he hoped that, as public men, they would in some way endeavour to justify it. (Hear, hear.) They had had a good deal of evidence laid before the House in regard to the administration of Martial Law, and he supposed many of them had had letters of complaint as to inconveniences suffered by the public in its administration Of course, wherever they declared Martial Law they put the administration into the hands of inexperienced officials and they were bound to make mistakes. One definition of Martial Law was that it was the price the country paid in order to save itself from something worse. (Hear, hear.) Administrative acts done under Martial Law must be done in good faith. The criticism of Martial Law centred on deportation. This House had to decide whether deportation was necessary in the interests of the State. As usual, they had had the legionaries of the law ranged on each side in this matter and, as usual, the lawyers differed. He put it that, in point of fact, this was not a legal question, but a question of statesmanship and a question of common-sense. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for Cape Town, Central, had used the argument that this was an unconstitutional and illegal act, that other unconstitutional and illegal acts had been committed by tyrants in times past when they had always set up this excuse that it was done in the interests of the State, and the hon. member for Smithfield had given them Nero as an example. The whole question was whether in this case deportation was necessary in the interests of the State. In July there was no doubt that the country was profoundly impressed by what occurred, by the disregard of law and order, the defiance of Government, and the violence that took place. They felt that there was no security in the situation, and in his own experience the question was asked everywhere, &#x201C;Why not send the leaders of this movement out of the country&#x003F;&#x201D; (Hear, hear.) Who were the men they had to deal with in January&#x003F; The same men who had organised the July revolution. They threatened another revolution; indeed they threatened something worse than the previous revolution&#x2014;(hear, hear)&#x2014;the same men, the same leaders whose names appeared in the Bill.</p>

<debateSection name="#not_reformers_but_revolutionaries">

<heading>NOT REFORMERS, BUT REVOLUTIONARIES.</heading>

<p><span class="col_629-630" refersTo="page_0321"/>He put it to the House and to the country that they were not dealing in this case with reformers, with men who were only anxious to carry out reforms in the laws, or reform the social condition of any part of the people of South Africa, but they were dealing with revolutionaries. (Cheers.) They were dealing with men who professed and preached what was called class war. The hon. member for Uitenhage had said that these men were not Syndicalists, but Socialists. He (Sir E. H. Walton) did not know Where the hon. member got his definition from, and he admitted that it was difficult to draw distinctions between the various sections of the Labour Party as they exist at the present time, but he understood that, as far as the Socialist movement was concerned, the class war had been definitely abandoned, that it was against the interest of society and therefore against the interest of Socialists. Still they found hon. members on the cross-benches advocating the class war. The hon. member for Uitenhage was talking about the Minister of Mines not understanding what Syndicalism was, and it struck him (Sir E. H. Walton) that the hon. member&#x2019;s own views were rather hazy.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#a_dangerous_path">

<heading>A DANGEROUS PATH.</heading>

<p>It seemed to him that in this case they were dealing with a body of men who honestly perhaps had embraced causes whose path was dangerous to any country. It was a path that lay through bloodshed and violence, and destruction of property, and it led to anarchy&#x2014;(hear, hear)&#x2014;and it was the men who advocated these causes that the Government were dealing with. He thought they had a right to ask whether the country should and could endure a repetition or a continuance of the disorders that had occurred. (Cheers.) The cost of this movement had not been dealt with by the Minister of Defence, but it must have been very considerable. Indirectly, the cost must have been enormous. He supposed that thousands of men had been thrown out of employment. Over 300 men, they had been told, had had to leave the Premier Diamond Mine.</p>

<speech by="#creswell">

<speech by="#walton">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. H. WALTON</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, no, they left of their own accord without any grievances of their own. Proceeding, he said that there was no strike in Port Elizabeth, but some of the men told him that, if the order came down and if it were generally obeyed, it would be a very difficult job for them. Of course, it was a very difficult job for a man to be treated with contempt by his fellow-workers. That was the tremendous engine that was used by this movement of Syndicalism. The first thing they did was to &#x2018;set aside the only protective, and that was the general ballot.</p>

<debateSection name="#unrest_means_loss">

<heading>UNREST MEANS LOSS.</heading>

<p>They heard of a class war, and now there was destitution, and they heard of a subscription list being carried about in Durban; and he supposed in other places the same thing was occurring. That thing must go on for some time, because their industries were disorganised, and it took time to reorganise them again, and during that time some of the men had to remain out of employment. Could any reasonable man doubt that these deportees intended a recurrence of the events in July, when they had been dealing with that situation in January&#x003F; Could any reasonable man doubt that they had been organising the same movement by the same means&#x003F; If they got a mob of excited men, and they said &#x201C;no violence,&#x201D; they might as well talk to the wind&#x2014;everybody knew that there would be violence. &#x201C;Had they the right as a country to deport any of their citizens&#x003F;&#x201D; was a question which had been raised during that debate but he said it was the inherent right in any community to say to any members that if they should have rendered themselves absolutely impossible to that community, they should have nothing more to do in regard to that community. Sometimes they were put to death, sometimes they were imprisoned; but here they had adopted a more merciful course, and had sent these men out of the country. (Hear, hear.) They had always welcomed people to this land who came to develop it, on the condition that they would observe their laws, and live amongst them in an amicable way. (Cheers.) He thought that one of the strongest arguments in favour of the deportation of these men was that it would give Parliament and that country a quiet time, in order to introduce other legislation, and to bring in measures, which he hoped would be brought in that session, which would enable the workers of that country to find a better way to the removal of grievances, or the bettering of their condition, than by violence and revolution. (Hear, hear.) It would give them a quiet time to give a start to the new ideas, and give time and opportunity for the bringing in and the carrying out of plans by private persons for the betterment of the workers. If they let loose a number of agitators, these improvements would not be effected, such as some of the mines were now making. As to the objections to the deportations of these men, first of all there was the &#x201C;superior&#x201D; objection&#x2014;(laughter)&#x2014;like that of the right hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. Merriman), and his putting on a Union Jack as a garment was rather a curious spectacle. (Laughter.) Although the right hon. gentleman and the hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Hull) had told the House that they loved the Government, they had rather a <span class="col_631-632" refersTo="page_0322"/>curious way of showing their love&#x2014;(laughter)&#x2014;and always chastised the Government in their speeches. Dealing with the quotation from the right hon. gentleman&#x2019;s speech which had been made use of by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, he (Sir E. H. Walton) thought that if Mr. MacDonald had heard the whole of the right hon. gentleman&#x2019;s speech, he would not have made that quotation, because, in the course of his speech, the light hon. member (Mr. Merriman) had been stronger than the Minister of Defence had been against these men. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman was satisfied that there had been a persistent effort on the part of these men, and that had been his argument. There had been that plan, call it what they like. He did not think that the right hon. member&#x2019;s words which had been quoted were justified by the whole course of his speech. As to what the Minister of Defence had said about not waiting until the fires had burnt down, he (Sir E. H. Walton) thought it a sensible remark to make. The further people got away from a crisis of this kind the less they realised the danger they had been through, and what he had understood the Minister to say was that he wanted the country to deal with the matter, while the country realised the danger, and while events and consequences were fresh in their minds, and before the country&#x2019;s attention had been distracted by other matters.</p>

<p>In reply to interruptions from Mr. Hull and Mr. Currey, he read a few telegrams with regard to a public meeting recently held in Port Elizabeth&#x2014;one from the Mayor, stating &#x201C;that the large majority of the residents supported the Government&#x2019;s actions in the recent crisis, but his (the Mayor&#x2019;s) opinion of the object of the meeting was that it was to influence votes for the next election (laughter)&#x2014;the hon. member went on to say, that as to the hon. member for Uitenhage (Mr. Fremantle) he had told them that the whole world of labour would be opposed to that action of the Government. What right had the hon. member to say that&#x003F; The whole world of labour knew nothing about that vet, and if they studied the evidence which had been laid before that House, he thought that the leaders of that Labour movement would strongly disapprove of many of the acts of these men who had been deported. (Hear, hear.) As to what had been said about making martyrs of these men, they would have done so if they had put them into gaol. (Hear, hear.)</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#banishment_must_follow">

<heading>BANISHMENT MUST FOLLOW.</heading>

<p>Now he would like to say a word with regard to the question of banishment. He thought that that must follow the decision to deport these men. (Hear, hear.) If they wanted these men out of the country and they agreed to send them out, then they must be kept out. (Hear, hear.) If their views were so dangerous, as he thought they were, then they must stay out of the country. Of course, he agreed that the deportation of these nine men would not settle-all the labour unrest in that country. The reason he was going to support the Bill was that the deportation of these men would give them a quiet time in which to consider the situation. It would give an opportunity to the workers to bring forward their grievances, and give the House time in which to settle these grievances in a legal and constitutional fashion. He said that those grievances should be dealt with by that Parliament. If they passed that Act then, as a natural sequence, they must proceed to deal with such legislation as had been framed by the Government. Everybody would agree that the workers of a country were the country, were the nation, and that upon the prosperity of the workers depended the prosperity of a country. If the workers brought forward grievances, then these must be remedied; but in the interests of the nation it was essential that they should deal fearlessly and relentlessly with anything in the nature of a revolution.</p>

<speech by="#nathan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. NATHAN</person> (Von Brandis)</from>

<p>said that he agreed largely with the speeches that had been delivered by the hon. member for Graham&#x2019;s Town, and the hon. member for Fort Beaufort. He thought that the House acted rightly in allowing the deportees to be represented at the bar by counsel. He listened with interest to the speech, but he thought that if Mr. Smith thought he had got the House to believe that his clients were angels then he was mistaken. He could not pass by lightly the reference by the hon. member for Barberton that the Minister of Railways always held his nose very high in the air. To that hon. gentleman he would just quote two lines of Burns:</p>

<p>&#x201C;O wad some power the giftie gie us, To see &#x2019;oorsels as &#x2019;ithers see us.&#x201D;</p>

<p>They had been told (he continued) by the hon. member for George Town that the breaking up of the meeting on the 4th of July was responsible for the rioting that had taken place. He wished to dissociate himself from that statement. He had seen what went on. He referred hon. members to page 35 of the Commission&#x2019;s report, which showed that the throwing of stones was a pre-conceived business on the part of the mob. He thought that if the opposition had placed their case before the two judges who sat on the Commission they would have received every consideration. It had been stated that it was an extraordinary thing that the case for the prosecution was based on extracts from the newspapers. What stronger evidence would a jury want than the spoors of the culprits&#x003F; The hon. member for Jeppe, as usual, when he wanted to get the ear of the House, abused the House. What good would a counsel do in a court of law if he started abusing the jury from the very start&#x003F; His hon. friend, said that he was proud of his company. <span class="col_633-634" refersTo="page_0323"/>He said that Mason was his friend and that it was a pity there were not more George Masons in the country, and he was supported in this statement by the hon. member for Roodepoort. He thought that the time would come when the hon. member for Jeppe would cry &#x201C;Save me from my friends.&#x201D; He thought that the country had had its eyes opened, and he was glad to see that the Government had awakened to the situation and used force. He thought that the country was grateful to the Government for what it had done. He had no hesitation in saying that had the treaty not been concluded on the 5th of July, the greater part of Johannesburg would have been razed to the ground. People he spoke to the very next day were glad it was over; but the Government was prepared for the other side when they started operations again in January.</p>

<heading>GOVERNMENT DID THE RIGHT THING.</heading>

<p>When the &#x201C;Star&#x201D; premises were burnt down in July there were between ten and twenty young ladies at work there, and but for Mr. Trimble and a few other gentlemen they would have met with a horrible death. &#x201C;The Worker,&#x201D; commenting on the destruction of the &#x201C;Star&#x201D; Offices, said: &#x201C;When at 10.30 these offices were seen in flames it is unquestionable that a cry of exultation rose in many thousands of throats, followed by keen disappointment when it was learnt next day that the machinery in this non-Union shop had escaped destruction.&#x201D; The attack was made on &#x201C;The Star&#x201D; because it was said that it had always been opposed to the Labour Party, but really the attack was made because &#x201C;The Star&#x201D; had set its face against the employment of Union men only.</p>

<p>On the following Monday he (Mr. Nathan) came in contact with one of the principal men engaged in the strike. He was a municipal employee, and he told him (Mr. Nathan) that he urged the people to cut off the sanitary service and the water supply, and that if this had been done the strike would have been successful. This person was born in this country, and he (Mr. Nathan) urged the Minister to make his new law applicable to people South African born. Having remarked that the natives who were arrested during the trouble were incited by the white agitators, Mr. Nathan stated that the strikers were careless and regardless of what damage they did. On July 5 the Government was absolutely powerless, and it did nothing but the right thing in making peace. He could understand the feeling of humiliation on the part of the Government in having to sign the treaty, but it was for the good of the country at large. The aims and objects of the strikers were to get everything for themselves and nothing for anybody else. That was a policy which no Government could support.</p>

<p>said it had been asserted there was no conspiracy, but the fires of disorder were breaking out all over the country, and Government knew, the time had arrived to take the bull by the horns. Martial Law was not proclaimed one single moment too soon, and but for it South Africa would have been ablaze front end to end. With regard to the deportations, he would deal with only one of the nine gentlemen concerned; he had had a very bitter experience of this gentleman, but he would not relate it to the House. Mason&#x2019;s statement, &#x201C;Send the King, Flag and Country to-Hell,&#x201D; was seditious language, and he could have been dealt with for saying this. If he had given ten years&#x2019; service to the country in building railways and harbours it would have been a good thing, and we could have got rid of him afterwards. If Mason were a fair sample of the other eight he (Mr. Nathan) would leave it to the House to judge whether or not the country was well rid of them. During January there had been 28 dynamite outrages on the railway, but not one of the perpetrators was caught.</p>

<speech by="#nathan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NATHAN</person> (continuing)</from>

<p>said that, in regard to the question of a trial in a Court of Justice, what he understood the Minister of Defence to say was that, in a Court of Justice there were a lot of legal technicalities which the accused might avail themselves of, and there was also the danger of a long delay in the trial. If the Minister had gone further, and said he believed that, under the jury system as it existed in this country, it would have been impossible to get a conviction, he (Mr. Nathan) would have agreed with him. What did Mrs. Fitzgerald and Crawford say when Ward was convicted&#x003F; They said, &#x201C;If Ward is guilty, we are guilty too.&#x201D; The hon. member read a telegram which he had received from a juryman protesting, as one of the jury, against the insinuations which had been made in this ease, and asking him <span class="col_635-636" refersTo="page_0324"/>(Mr. Nathan) to explain to the House that the acquittals were due to lack of evidence, and that, under their oath as jurymen, they could not convict. He went on to say that when he was first made acquainted with the deportation, he, along with many other lawyers, was shocked that a person should be deported without trial. They had often heard it said that the liberty of the subject was supreme. But there was something which was more supreme than that, for regard for the public welfare was the highest law. It was unthinkable that, in ordinary circumstances, under ordinary conditions, a subject could be deported without a trial. It could not be done, and it would not be done and he thought there was no danger whatever of creating what many had called a precedent. In regard to the way in which the ballot was conducted in January last, he pointed out that, according to the Press report, between 35 and 40 shop assistants in Johannesburg were present when the ballot was taken. He supposed that that did not even represent 1 per cent. of the shop assistants in Johannesburg. He had a little fault to find with the Minister of Defence when he spoke of these gentlemen whose names appeared in the schedule to the Bill as appearing in the &#x201C;Honours List.&#x201D; He thought that that description should be changed to &#x201C;Disgrace List.&#x201D; He was satisfied that very strong cumulative evidence had been laid before the House, showing that these people were a real danger, and a menace to society in general, and in particular to the men whom they stuffed with their bad advice. He was satisfied, and he thought the majority of the people in the country were satisfied, that the Government honestly did their best in the best interests of the country. It was said that this would not stop the agitation. Of course, it wouldn&#x2019;t stop it, but it would be an example to others. In conclusion, Mr. Nathan said that if the Government were determined to include this banishment clause in their Bill, he would support it; but he was quite prepared, if the Government in their wisdom decided to delete that clause and allow these men to come back and stand their trial, not to quarrel with their decision.</p>

<speech by="#wessels">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. H. W. WESSELS</person> (Bechuanaland)</from>

<p>said that the events of July and January were indeed an eye-opener to the whole of South Africa, and they had stirred the people of the backveld as they had seldom been stirred before. Those events gave to South Africa a very good idea of how far the Labour leaders were prepared to go if they only got the opportunity, and enabled the people to realise what a danger Syndicalism was in South Africa. If there was one determination that emerged, it was the determination of all classes of the community to stand by the Government, and assist them in their endeavour to put down this attempt to bring about an industrial revolution. With regard to the statement that a good many burghers had been converted by what they had seen, his belief was that if they were called out again in Johannesburg it would be a very difficult matter indeed for the Government to restrain them. He thought the weakness or unpreparedness of the Government in July was largely responsible for what happened in January. To his mind, it was clear that all the grievances which were afterwards put forward were a mere pretext. These people were determined to try conclusions with the Government. On reading the report of the Judicial Commission, one could come to no other conclusion than that these people were determined to bring about an industrial revolution and paralyse trade and that their object was to bring the Government and people of South Africa to their knees. To his mind it was clear that if the Government in January had not proclaimed Martial Law these people would have attained their object. With the exception of hon. members on the cross-benches, the member for Smithfield, and, he thought, the member for Barberton, he believed that it was common cause in this House that there was every possible justification for Martial Law. It was difficult to ascertain from the hon. member for Smithfield what he was really driving at. He could well understand that the hon. member felt it a very difficult matter now to approve of the action of the Government. Even in Europe they had nothing but praise for the prompt action which the Government had taken.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield (General Hertzog) had said that Parliament ought to have been called together sooner and a Commission appointed to go into the grievances under Martial Law. If such a Commission had been appointed, they would have had hundreds of cases coming before them; and would the House have been prepared to compensate all these people for acts incurred under Martial Law&#x003F; They knew it was impossible to carry out Martial Law without carrying on allegalities. One could not help congratulating the Government on what they had done, and a large measure of praise was due to the Minister of Defence, who showed that during all that time he had kept a cool head, and was able to show that he had organised well. What he (Mr. Wessels) was more concerned with was the lessons to be learnt from the disturbances of July and January. He did not agree with those people who said that the Government had ended Syndicalism in South Africa. &#x201C;The tortoise had only pulled in its head,&#x201D; and the Government would be well advised to be on the watch. (Hear, hear.) These people would come forward again, when it was most inconvenient to deal with them. Proceeding, the hon. member said that he had a letter from his constituents that in certain outlying parts the police had been withdrawn during the recent trouble, and no provision had been made by the Government for others to take their place.</p>

<p><span class="col_637-638" refersTo="page_0325"/>It was very undesirable that the whole country should be unpoliced; especially in outlying places, where they had large numbers of natives. (Hear, hear.) He hoped that the Minister would see that in future arrangements were made for special constables to take the place of the police who were withdrawn. He also instanced the inconvenience which had resulted on farms, because burghers had been taken away. He drew attention to the fact that some men were out of pocket, as a result of the expenses which they had had to incur as burghers, and said that that should not be the case. He hoped the Minister would give that matter his earnest consideration.</p>

<p>Touching on the Labour movement, he said that when Labour went as far as it had attempted to do&#x2014;adopted Syndicalism, tried to paralyse trade in that country, and tried to secure its aims and objects by violence, it was the opinion of the country that legislation must be introduced&#x2014;and must be introduced that session&#x2014;to put a stop to it. (Hear, hear.) It was necessary that the rights of labour and employers should be settled that session, even if they had to sit to June and July. He hoped that the machinery would be able to deal with the legitimate grievances of Labour, but the position of the employer had also to be considered. He referred to the losses incurred by property owners in Johannesburg during the July events, and also to the feeling of insecurity, which had led to a loss of trade, and the bankruptcy or several small men, he was informed.</p>

<p>As to the railways, he was not so certain that those of authority were as accessible as they ought to be. What he wanted was this: that machinery should be established by which a channel through which the men could get their grievances redressed should always be open. The men ought to be seriously punished if they went on strike&#x2014;(hear, hear)&#x2014;and not only lose their rights and privileges, because the railway was a most important thing for that country. The wages paid on the South African railways compared favourably with those paid on railways in other parts of the world. If legislation was to be introduced, he hoped that the agitator would be seriously dealt with. (Hear, hear.) These agitators lived by manufacturing grievances for these people, and they knew how easily the people were led away. Why should society put up with these agitators&#x003F; They were no use to the country. As to the &#x201C;last hurdle where so many of the horses had jibbed,&#x201D; these deportees deserved all they got, because one and all were agitators, whose sole aim had been to create trouble. Was there anyone in that House who would say that any single one of these agitators was a loss to South Africa&#x003F; He would have been more pleased if these men had been brought to trial, but the Minister of Defence had been very frank with that House, and stated that the Government had come to the conclusion, after serious consideration, that it was in the best interests of South Africa that these people-should be deported. As to creating martyrs, they created martyrs very easily in the ranks of the Labour Party&#x2014;(laughter) &#x2014;and that argument did not weigh much with him at all. The Government, in his opinion, had done so well in January, that he was not prepared to quarrel with them, and when it came to the second reading he would give the Bill his support.

<heading>NATAL AND THE SITUATION.</heading>

<speech by="#henderson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. HENDERSON</person> (Durban, Berea)</from>

<p>at the outset referred to the speeches which had been delivered in the course of that debate by hon. members who represented Natal constituencies, and said that he thought there was an opinion in Natal, somewhat between the two extremes of the speeches of the hon. member for Durban, Umbilo (Mr. Robinson) and the hon. member for Durban, Greyville (Mr. Boydell). He did not attach much importance to the speeches from the cross-benches. They had been very long, and it seemed to him that there was a sort of insincerity about some of these speeches. He thought hon. members must have been struck by the fact that when things reached the crisis, or particular work had to be done which might involve danger or great responsibility the hon. members on the cross-benches disappeared from the scene for a time. He did not say they did this wittingly, but they were swept aside by stronger men and took a back seat for a time. He went on to refer to the circular issued to the workers by the hon. member for Jeppe, and said that while this was being circulated through the Transvaal, the strike was declared off. He thought they should devote their attention to the speech of the Minister of Defence, which was the Government&#x2019;s case for the passing of this measure. He did not think that that speech was entirely convincing, but that it betrayed the weakness of the Government's case. If the Government had such a strong case as they had led the House to believe surely the Minister could have stated it to the House in less than 5&#x00BD; hours. He was not convincing in regard to the proclamation of Martial Law in Natal. Martial Law was necessary along the Reef, but surely it was not necessary in Natal, where they had previously a big railway strike and when the ordinary laws were found quite sufficient. He thought that under the circumstances the Government might have shown more confidence and respect for the people of Natal. He strongly endorsed everything that had been said regarding the loyalty of the men at the Cape, but he would point out at the same time that there were loyal men in other parts of the Union. He pointed out that in Natal men had greater pressure put upon them than was the case at the Cape. He hoped these men in Natal would be remembered when the time came and would receive their just reward. A sad aspect of the matter <span class="col_639-640" refersTo="page_0326"/>was the men who were still out of work. These men the Minister had called the dupes of the agitators and he hoped that their cases would be taken into consideration.</p>

<speech by="#henderson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENDERSON</person> (continuing)</from>

<p>said in regard to the deportations he thought the Government had lost sight of their perspective in the matter. They not only chartered a special boat for the men, but gave their wives passages at the expense of the country, and he thought these men were going to have the time of their lives in England. He did not see why the Government should deal with two classes of people in different ways. He thought that the Minister did not convince the House that deportation was necessary. He thought the strike at the Kleinfontein Mine was the beginning of the whole business. The Government did not handle the thing properly in July and they were far too weak. If they had taken decided action he was of opinion that all the trouble would have been stamped out at the beginning. He did not blame the Government for coming to a treaty on July 5; under the circumstances they could have done nothing else to prevent further bloodshed and destruction of property. But he thought they could be blamed for all that happened up to that time. Then they took the thing in hand properly, and he thought the whole country was satisfied that the Government took proper action in January. He thought the Government was right in calling out the Defence Force and proclaiming Martial Law, but he was not satisfied that the Government was justified in deporting these nine men. Of course, it was an easy way to get rid of trouble by throwing these men out but he thought that the Government should have taken a stronger course and should have dealt with the men in this country If the law was not sufficient, they could have kept these men in gaol under Martial Law until special legislation had been passed. In Natal under Martial Law they sent a signalman to gaol for a year without trial because he simply tampered with the signal. Why could not the same course have been followed in regard to the nine deportees&#x003F; The evidence in connection with at least one case was not very strong. In one case there was no evidence at all. McKerrell went to Natal in connection with the coal strike, but surely that was not sufficient evidence for deporting him. Then it was said that he had acted in a defiant fashion towards the Secretary for Mines, but the House had only heard one side of the question.</p>

<heading>RACIAL LEGISLATION.</heading>

<p>&#x201C;He hoped that the strike would not stop.&#x201D; But many other people had said the same thing. McKerrell also said, &#x201C;The Industrial Bills would not come before Parliament.&#x201D; But Government itself had said that. (Laughter.) Was that a crime to warrant deportation&#x003F; McKerrell also said, &#x201C;We shall hold the Government up to prevent it.&#x201D; He (Mr. Henderson) supposed that was the gravamen of the charge. Such a charge was lamentably weak. (Hear, hear.) Any of them might use words like that without meaning them very much, and he did not see why McKerrell should have been picked out for deportation. The fact that all the deported men were born outside South Africa was a case of race legislation and would only cause trouble in the long run. (Hear, hear.) But the Bill must be taken as a whole, and while agreeing with the proclamation of Martial Law, some hon. members could not support the clause regarding deportation. He had wanted to move an amendment which would have met his view of the case, but he was informed that it would have been out of order. He was quite willing to agree to the second reading of the Bill, coupled with the regret that the men were sent out of the country without trial, but he was not prepared to reject the Bill altogether. He thought the Government did the right thing in declaring Martial Law and thereby saving the country from a terrible crisis, for he believed it was the intention of the agitators to establish their own rule&#x2014;(cheers)&#x2014;and therefore Parliament must back up the Government no matter what hon. members&#x2019; politics were. While he agreed to the second reading, he entered his protest against men being sent out of the country without trial. (Hear, hear.)</p>

<speech by="#fichardt">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. G. FICHARDT</person> (Ladybrand)</from>

<p>said the hon. member for Port Elizabeth, Central (Sir E. H. Walton) had stated that the country wanted a quiet time, but how the hon. member thought that could be obtained by doing something which was wholly illegal and against the practice of a civilised country, was a mystery. There were more hon. members on the Opposition side of the House who were in agreement with the Government on the deportation question than there were on the Ministerial side. (Laughter and cheers.) One thing which had impressed itself on his mind was the baiting of the Labour Party which had been going on in the House. On one occasion the Prime Minister had stated that it was not cricket to do a certain thing. Did the Prime Minister consider this sort of thing cricket&#x2014;bringing his own forces and that of the Opposition, and kicking a very dead dog for nearly three weeks&#x003F; Hon. members were asked to arrive at a fair and <span class="col_641-642" refersTo="page_0327"/>solemn judgment of the action of the Government in connection with Martial Law and the illegal deportation of citizens. If the Government could justify the Proclamation of Martial Law, he was prepared to vote for any Indemnity Bill which would he fair, but the deportation was another matter entirely. He had heard nothing which justified the deportation of men from their own country without a fair trial, and that portion of the Bill he was not prepared to vote for under any circumstances.</p>

<debateSection name="#discontent_general">

<heading>DISCONTENT GENERAL.</heading>

<p>What was the evidence&#x003F; They had had the ex parte and very highly-coloured statement of the Minister of Defence, who tried to prove there was a vast conspiracy, but that astute Minister bit off a good deal more than he could chew. Then there had been an ex parte and almost equally highly-coloured statement by the hon. member for Jeppe (Mr. Creswell) that there was a vast Governmental conspiracy. But the average member did not believe in the existence of either conspiracy. Then the Government had dragged in by the heels the hon. member for Smithfield (General Hertzog); this rather looked like an attempt to make party capital out of the situation. (Hear, hear.) The statement by the Minister of Defence as to the existence of a vast conspiracy was not only highly coloured, but it was worse, for in the very nature of things it was desperately prejudiced.</p>

<p>What were the causes of the strike&#x003F; Had they not, as a Parliament, by their treatment of their public servants, rendered the soil fruitful for the agitator&#x003F; They were not altogether blameless in this matter. (Mr. Fremantle: Hear, hear.) From the Minister&#x2019;s statement, one would imagine that there was contentment throughout the public services. Was that so&#x003F; Was there no evidence of discontent among the railwaymen, the Civil Servants, postal and telegraph employees, the teachers, the agriculturists, business men, and even, it was rumoured, in the party of the Prime Minister himself&#x003F; (Laughter and &#x201C;Hear, hear.&#x201D;) Did it follow that the discontent among all these sections was caused by the Amalgamated Society, or by the nine men who had been deported &#x003F; Government would like the House to believe that all this unrest was caused by the nine deported men. Proceeding, the hon. member said that he did not think the Government would for a moment admit that it was their incompetence which brought the trouble about, but still one would imagine that the Government would not have drawn so long a bow as they had done in the matter of trying to settle so much of the blame on the strikers. The country was realising that something was wrong, and at that point a brilliant inspiration shot through the mind of the Government&#x2014;he referred, of course, to the hon. Minister of Defence. It was not incompetence, on, no! but Syndicalism&#x2014;blessed word, Mesopotamia. That inspiration led to the deportation of nine men. No one believed that the sending away of nine men was going to make any difference to the economic problem in this country. Continuing, the hon. member said that the proclamation of Martial Law might have been necessary in Johannesburg, though he could not help remembering a soliloquy of the Minister of Defence as he stood at the window of the Carlton watching the thousands going about their usual avocations, &#x201C;not knowing they were in a doomed city.&#x201D; Perhaps the hon. member himself was wrong, perhaps these people were not in a doomed city. The proclamation of Martial Law in Bloemfontein, said Mr. Fichardt, was wholly unnecessary. As far as Bloemfontein was concerned, no one, not blinded by prejudice, would argue for a moment that Martial Law was necessary, nor was there any necessity to go to the expense of calling out the Defence Force there. Bloemfontein was one of the quietest towns in the whole Union. It was true that some of the men went on strike, but there was no violence attached to it, nor was there any sort of rioting whatever. Apparently, however, the Minister of Defence had some visions. He (the speaker) went to some of the meetings of the men, out of curiosity, but he did not hear one single word of violence suggested. The whole object of the Bloemfontein speakers was to urge upon the workers that whatever happened there must be no violence, no rioting, and no lawlessness. That was done over and over again. At the time that the strike was at its highest, the men went to the Assistant Manager of Railways and asked permission to play a cricket match; they got permission, and for two days they played at cricket. That, all would admit, did not look like the action of men who were prepared to do violence. He had lived in Bloemfontein all his life, and had comparatively large interests there, but he could say that he had not had a moment&#x2019;s fear that the men there would do anything that was not entirely lawful. He could speak for many other citizens; not a single one of whom took any sort of precaution to protect his property, nor did any of the merchants, so far as he could ascertain, think it worth while to take out a life insurance policy. If Martial Law was not justified any more in other places than it was in Bloemfontein, there was no right on the part of the Government to declare Martial Law. Indeed, the only danger they had in Bloemfontein was that the proclamation of Martial Law might have led to some trouble amongst otherwise peaceful citizens. It was all a matter of viewpoint, in his opinion; it seemed to him that that point of view of the top dog was entirely different from that of the under dog.</p>

<p>Proceeding, he said he would like to refer to the riot at Jagersfontein. The hon. <span class="col_643-644" refersTo="page_0328"/>member said that on the same day of the trouble an incident happened which threw a lurid light on what might have occurred; fit was a providential flash-light on the whole situation.

<p>said he would quote from memory, and, proceeding, said that the Minister in his speech said that a body of nine thousand of natives broke out of the compound at Jagersfontein, and invaded the town. But did the hon. member know that in the first place there were not nine thousand natives there, that was one of the exaggerations&#x2014;one of the dabs of red paint&#x2014;as a matter of fact there were only eight thousand. (Hon. Members: Oh, oh.)</p>

<p>Well, proceeded the speaker, if it was only a thousand it was an exaggeration. Hon. members had enjoyed that, the Prime Minister amongst them, but would he enjoy the information that it was an absolute fact that not a single one of those natives ever got out of the compound. (Labour cheers.) That was not quite so humorous, yet the hon. Minister of Defence had said that a body of nine thousand natives from the Jagersfontein Mines had invaded the town. Men were sent down from the Military School at Bloemfontein and the Burgher Force was called out, but when they got there all the trouble had been settled. The Minister of Finance in referring to that little incident of the Jagersfontein rising, said he thought that the warning was a good one. Why&#x003F; &#x201C;Because it tightened up the people for the coming struggle.&#x201D; For what struggle&#x003F; lo break the law themselves&#x003F; Was it used to tighten up the people in this country to pass unconstitutional methods&#x003F;</p>

<heading>POUTSMA&#x2019;S CAREER.</heading>

<p>Then there was a third point. In regard to the deportees there was only one, Poutsma, whom he knew and it was only fair to assume that, if every one of them had been so hopelessly misrepresented as he had been, there was very good reason for believing that the characters of the others had been a little exaggerated, too. He was a man who, whatever his faults might have been, had worked hard and loyally, especially for the people who were so largely represented on that side of the House. He came out from Holland with the Dutch Ambulance during the war, and faithfully, from the time when he arrived in this country, stuck to the Boer forces to the end. There was a member of that House who had special reasons to be grateful for the attention of Poutsma during that trying period. He suffered badly from disease, and Poutsma stuck to him for six weeks. At the conclusion of the war it was the wish of the people whom he had come to help that he should go to Europe and accompany President Steyn. They called him Dr. Poutsma&#x201D; in those days. He had done good work and he deserved every courtesy for what he had done. As soon as he was relived from his duties when in Holland. he went round the country and collected all the money he could to bring back to this country in order to help the orphans of those who had fallen in the war. He established a little institution from his own money and the money he had collected and other contributions, but so poor was his organisation that this little institution failed. Without sixpence of wage or salary he worked on that project for three or four years. After that, having nothing, he came to Bloemfontein and joined one of their papers, and he also became one of the secretaries of their political party. He organised a little newspaper and he was appointed Secretary of the Railway and Harbour Service organisation. He did not know what terrible crime Poutsma could have committed when in Holland, but the Minister of Defence had drawn him as one of the greatest rascals in existence. In order to gain a small party advantage it was the height of meanness, he considered that this man should now be dubbed a sinister figure, a diabolical schemer, and a heartless, coldblooded Syndicalist. There was one other point that he might mention, and that was that Mr. Ramsay MacDonald had denied having signed the document which was produced with so much gusto by the Minister of Defence the other day. If they had to judge of the position of the Government on the four points on which he had been able to test them, then, as far as he was concerned, he was not inclined to place much credence in what had been produced in that House. He would ask hon. members to beware of conspiracies and catastrophies which had been produced by the Government.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#barbary_ostriches">

<heading>BARBARY OSTRICHES.</heading>

<p>Did the House remember the shadow of that great catastrophe which hung over the land two years ago when the present Minister of Mines, who did not then occupy his present exalted position, set off for Middelburg. Did the House remember how he came back with his eyes bulging out of his head in terror at the hideous thing he had seen, how he told them that it was necessary to act at once, to furnish an expedition to a foreign country and fetch some talisman from there which was necessary for our salvation&#x003F; (Laughter.) The whole thing was to be kept a deadly secret, but eventually it leaked out, and they had the expedition to acquire the Barbary ostriches. The ostriches eventually arrived after an expedition that cost thousands of pounds, and then it was found that there was not a piece of double-fluff amongst them. (Laughter.) That was the position to-day. <span class="col_645-646" refersTo="page_0329"/>To his mind the speech of the Minister, the unexpurgated report and the pamphlet which was afterwards issued of that speech, constituted the most damning indictment of the incompetency of the Government. What did they find in June and July&#x003F; The Government, this Government of strong men, were in a state of hopeless vacillation. He asked, and the country wanted to know, why these inciters, these incendiaries, and this lawless gang were not arrested at once and punished, whether they were members of Parliament or not. As to these crimes of violence, these crimes referred to in the Commissioners&#x2019; report, where it was stated that pickets and strikers assaulted men with impunity and that no prosecutions followed, surely there was enough in the common law to run fellows in for assaulting others improperly or assaulting them at all. If the Government had not the power, why not have sworn in immediately a whole number of special constables to help the Government&#x003F;</p>

<debateSection name="#july_and_january">

<heading>JULY AND JANUARY.</heading>

<p>If that did not help, why could they not have called out the burghers&#x003F; The Minister&#x2019;s excuse was that the Burgher Force was not organised at that time. He thought that was a yarn he should have told the marines&#x2014;men who had been through the war! Could they not have been got together as easily in July as in January&#x003F; If it was competent to call them out in January, why had it not been competent to call them out in July&#x003F; If the Government&#x2019;s case was correct&#x2014;that they did not have sufficient power&#x2014;why had not Parliament been immediately summoned&#x003F; Parliament would have been very willing indeed to give the necessary authority. The whole evidence he had been able to weigh went to show that in June and July, when these people ought to have been punished, they (the Government) had allowed themselves to get into a thundering mess, for which the Government was entirely responsible. And now they had the headpiece and mouthpiece of the Government coming down there&#x2014;underdoing things in July and overdoing things in January&#x2014;saying, in a light and airy sort of way, that he was guilty, and asking for an acquittal. They had, he (the hon. member) supposed, to pass the indemnity; but there ought to be uttered a word of censure against the Government for its incompetence, and he (Mr. Fichardt) would certainly do so. From the speech of the Minister of Defence, it seemed that the Government lost its nerve in July and lost its head in January. If they had put the rioters at 5,000, and he thought that was a high figure, what did the Minister do to quell them&#x003F; He called together 70,000 men, or more than had been mobilised by the whole of the Republic for the war. It seemed as if he had got out an 80-ton gun to shoot a crow, and according to the Prime Minister, it seemed that he shot the wrong crow. (Laughter.) Proceeding, the hon. member said that he thought he had succeeded in showing that there was, at least, considerable exaggeration in the indictment which the Minister had laid before them. There had been an attempt to prejudice that House, where the Prime Minister had the greatest following &#x2014;at the present time&#x2014;by making mean insinuations against the hon. and gallant member for Smithfield (General Hertzog). He asked why had the hon. member&#x2019;s name been dragged in&#x003F; Had he had anything to do with the strike&#x003F; But, emboldened by what had happened at the Carlton Hotel, the Minister thought, &#x201C;We have killed the Labour Party, and now we shall try to do the same to the hon. member for Smith-field.&#x201D; If that was not an attempt to make party capital out of it, he did not know what was. It had been a remarkably well-timed jibe for the Minister of Defence-to make, when at the time the Minister of Mines had been feeling the pulse of the electors of Malmesbury&#x2014;(laughter)&#x2014;and while the Minister of Railways and Harbours was visiting England. The Minister of Defence&#x201D; had made an offensive insinuation against the hon. member for Smith field, because the latter had hot &#x201C;coupled on the truncheon when the costermonger was jumping on his mother.&#x201D; (Laughter.) The hon. member proceeded to read from the Transvaal Hansard some remarks which the Minister had made with regard to the-hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Quinn), and went on to say that he had no doubt that the country would note the offensive-and gratuitous insult which had been offered by the Minister of Defence to the hon. member for Smithfield&#x2014;the honoured leader of the people of the O.F.S. (Hear, hear.) For himself, he (Mr. Fichardt) had not the least doubt that when the historian of the future had to decide who was the greater patriot he would not have the slightest doubt as to who had been the greater patriot during the later stages of the war and immediately prior to Union. (Cheers.) The fact remained that the Minister of Defence had told them in that House that they should judge before the fires of passion had died down. What judgment did the Minister expect under those circumstances&#x003F; It was not justice which the Minister of Defence looked to, in that House; it was revenge. It was not justice but it was making party capital. Things were coming to a pretty pass when in that House and in that country they were asked to pass judgment before the fires of passion had died down, and he would be astonished if the people would be satisfied with that most immoral principle as laid down in the House by the Minister.</p>

<p>Continuing, the speaker asked what evidence had been submitted to that House. They had been given police reports. They had had newspaper reports, and they all knew what reliance could be placed on those reports. Then the Minister tried to clinch the matter by all this talk about a big conspiracy. He did not think that at <span class="col_647-648" refersTo="page_0330"/>the last the House would confirm the deportations. The Cole precedent had been quoted, but it was a poor sort of precedent; if that precedent could be so easily used he would ask his hon. friends on his side of the House how much more easily could that precedent which they were asked to create be used in the future. The Minister of Defence in the last portion of his speech said that anybody who committed such crimes as these would be deported. They did not appear to want very much to deport anybody, and he asked the House to be very careful in dealing out this power. Continuing, he asked the hon. the Minister of Mines to remember the great conspiracy of fifteen years ago, and asked him whether he remembered the &#x2018;articles, when he was in control of &#x201C;Ons Land,&#x201D; denouncing the wickedness and the immorality of Martial Law. They had a different version to-day. The difference was, of course, the top dog. But he supposed that circumstances altered sentiments and even principles. Continuing, he said they had been asked to arrive at a calm and considered judgment. But had the Prime Minister helped them to arrive at a calm and considered judgment&#x003F; No, the fact was that the Prime Minister did not want a calm and considered judgment. No, the Prime Minister was out with a tin of red paint arid a large brush and he laid it on as thick as he possibly could. He proceeded to refer to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s vivid description of what had happened in Johannesburg in July, and asked the Prime Minister whether he was not aware that there were larger cities than Johannesburg in the world. The Prime Minister had, said that if he had not intervened tens of thousands would have been shot down. Well, there had been riots in larger cities than Johannesburg, but could the Prime Minister point to one instance where tens of thousands had been shot&#x003F; The object of the Government, he declared, was to create prejudice in order that panic legislation might be passed. The Minister of Defence had said that the Government only arrived at the decision to deport after careful and prolonged consideration, and he wondered, after hearing the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech, why the latter was not told of the decision of the Ministry. (Laughter.) The Prime Minister had told them that the real commandants were there. Well, if the real commandants were in the House, why were they there&#x003F; After all, they had been told of the hon. member for Springs. What did the Prime Minister do, but place him upon his own particular Select Committee. If all they were told were true, why was he out of 121 members selected for that committee&#x003F;</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#against_the_bill">

<heading>AGAINST THE BILL.</heading>

<p>He believed the large part of the trouble lay in the fact that there was so little sympathy with hopes and aspirations of the people. When the hon. member for Fords-burg (Mr. Duncan) made the reasonable suggestion that there should be a special tribunal for the trial of the deported men, the Prime Minister met the suggestion with a huge guffaw. When a representative Congress met in the Orange Free State the other day it was called a comedy. The Prime Minister had ruthlessly shed nearly half his Ministers, and those who remained swopped portfolios with the seasons. (Laughter.) Everyone who disagreed with him he dubbed a lost Hottentot. (Laughter.) That did not make for good government or peace. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the Bill, went on Mr. Fichardt, he would not vote for it, for this reason, he was prepared to give the Government an indemnity for things fairly done, but not when it acted on the principle that it could deport people whoever they might be without trial. In conclusion, he would say that he did not believe in any of the conspiracies laid before them. He believed there was some trouble, but it was magnified. While agreeing to the indemnity portion of the Bill, he would, as far as he possibly could, oppose the deportation of men without trial and without proper warrant. He did not believe it was in the interests of South Africa that such an immoral principle should be laid down in this country.</p>

<speech by="#runciman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. RUNCIMAN</person> (South Peninsula)</from>

<p>said the hon. member who had just spoken had expressed surprise at there being so much support for the Bill from the Opposition side of the House. What had surprised him (Mr. Runciman) was that so much opposition to the measure should come from those who were sitting behind the Prime Minister. (Government cheers.) There had been a good deal of talk about a conspiracy, but if there had not been a conspiracy on the Rand it was very evident that there was a conspiracy on the part of a section of the South African Party to wreck the Government. (Ministerial cheers.) The hon. member for Lady brand, in a most flippant manner, had done nothing but abuse the Government, but not one single word did he utter of protest against the acts perpetrated during the riots. (Ministerial cheers.) Everything, he said, was to belittle the Government and pour contempt upon it. It had been stated in the past that the great South African Party was so united that it was impossible to put it down. Where was that party now&#x003F; (Laughter.) A party led by the hon. members for Victoria West (Mr. Merriman), Smithfield (General Hertzog), Barberton (Mr. Hull), and Uitenhage (Mr. Fremantle) was, he supposed, after the next general election to take the place of the gentlemen now occupying the Treasury Benches. That accounted for the attitude they had taken up in this debate&#x2014;(Ministerial cheers)&#x2014;and their appealing to hon. members to abandon the Government in order that hon. members might help them. (Ministerial cheers.) If there ever was an exhibition for party purposes it was the <span class="col_649-650" refersTo="page_0331"/>speeches made by the hon. members he had just referred to.</p>

<p>The members of the South African Party had always held themselves out to be great patriots, while hon. members on the Opposition side had always been referred to as Uitlanders and foreign adventurers. Now, however, the tables were turned. Now when the country was in distress and the Government had done something to help the people out of danger, it rested with these Uitlanders and the foreign adventurers to aid the Government. (Hear, hear.) Times like the present were not the occasion for the indulgence of party politics, and as far as he, was concerned, he was going to vote for the Bill in its entirety. (Ministerial cheers.) But at the same time he was not going to absolve the Government from all blame in connection with what occurred at Johannesburg during June and July. He happened to be on the Rand during those months. The Government was responsible for the strike and the horrors that accompanied it. The men&#x2019;s grievances had been ventilated, yet Government had done nothing to redress them. It was only after the fearful doings at Johannesburg that Government recognised that there should be some redress, and this was a recognition that the strike was justified. The strikers were actuated not merely by desire for more money, but by anger against neglect in regard to miners&#x2019; phthisis.</p>

<speech by="#runciman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. RUNCIMAN</person> (South Peninsula),</from>

<p>resuming his speech, said that when the House adjourned he was endeavouring to point out the real cause of the unrest and disturbances which took place in Johannesburg during July of last year. He had stated that, from personal inquiries which he made at the time, this unrest was due in a large measure to the ravages and stress arising out of miners phthisis. The hon. member for Barberton had put it down largely to the differences between the employers and employees, but he (Mr. Runciman) did not attach much importance to that. His opinions regarding this question had been gained through personal observation. He had gone to the men at their houses and had gained his information at first hand. During the present session a return had been laid on the Table, showing that last year 3,000 cases of miners&#x2019; phthisis were presented to that House for amelioration and relief. Those 3,000 men were in Johannesburg in July last year, and what was their condition then&#x003F; Some of them knew they had only a few months to live, and none of them more than two years; consequently they did not care what took place. Under those conditions they became very easy prey to the agitators who were so anxious to stir up strife in Johannesburg. These men had nothing to lose, they had suffered terribly by the disease, and the spirit of despair had come upon them. It was in a great measure due to that spirit that the trouble arose. Their condition had its influence on their fellow-workmen, who thus became more or less imbued with the same spirit. Proceeding, the hon. member said that he had no sympathy with the extreme measures which were taken by the men&#x2019;s leaders at that time to bring about the trouble. They went so far as to kill all public sympathy which had been in their favour, and the public rose against them. An orderly protest, against the disabilities under which they were suffering would have gained-them more in the end. It had been said there was no connection at all between the miners and the dynamite outrages, but he had come into contact with some of the miners, who had admitted to him that they had for months been storing up dynamite in preparation. When he (Mr. Runciman) expressed his horror of such things the miners stated that they had been ordered to do so by their leaders.</p>

<p>said he only hoped the hon. members on the cross-benches would be able to repudiate these statements, and he hoped as he went on that they would be able to repudiate a few more. They said there was no conspiracy, but as the result of a search made in the native compounds on the Wednesday previous to the 4th of July, hundreds of weapons were found, which had been secreted by the natives in preparation for what was about to take place. They had been advised to do it. When asked whom they were going to use the weapons against, their answer was; not against the Government, but against the white miners.</p>

<p>could not say, but the white miners would certainly have been the first sufferers if anything had taken place. The white miners were the first to set the example. A large percentage of the strikers were dragged out and terrorised. Those who had condemned the Government for not taking more severe measures in connection with the putting down of <span class="col_651-652" refersTo="page_0332"/>meetings at Benoni would have been the first to condemn the Government for limiting free speech if they had done so. The Socialists at that time found that the time was not ripe enough for their purpose, and made terms with the Government. They set to work to stir up discontent and determined to bring about a general strike through the Union.</p>

<p>Poutsma had by that time captured the Railway Society. As far as the organisation was concerned, they were ready to bring about this calamity of a general strike. The retrenchment on the railways gave them a good excuse to stir up the men and make them believe that they were being very unfairly treated.

<speech by="#runciman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUNCIMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I will accept the statement of the hon. member for Jeppe, but let me say that he has identified himself with those who were in favour of a general strike, and that even during the time this debate has been going on he has been supporting those who were in favour of it. (Hear, hear.) I am glad to hear these hon. gentlemen state that they are not in favour of a general strike, because the Federation of Trades will be able to find out the true support they may expect to get from these gentlemen. Proceeding, Mr. Runciman said it was the fear of a general strike which caused the Government to proclaim Martial Law. If such a calamity had occurred, the result would have been starvation and looting, and civil war would inevitably have followed. (Hear, hear) He could not understand how any man in that House could do otherwise than support this measure, not only for deportation, but also for keeping these men out of South Africa. He thought the Government were perfectly justified in deporting these men. His hon. friends on the cross-benches had asked for a precedent. The Government had in one way or another attempted to give a precedent. He would give one from the Socialists&#x2019; own books. When the Socialist Colony was formed in Paraguay, one of the regulations laid down was that no intoxicating liquor was to be consumed. A few of the men were used to a little drop after a hard day&#x2019;s work. Three of these men broke away from the regulation, they went over the border of their country, and they returned in a very drunken state. They were brought un before the directors of the colony, and the directors, being Socialists immediately acted as Socialists did in these circumstances&#x2014;they became more autocratic than the Czar of Russia. Without a trial, these-men were immediately deported, and to make humiliation more complete, the adjoining countries were asked, to supply a cordon of armed native policemen, in order to march these men but of the country.</p>

<heading>GREAT BRITAIN&#x2019;S DIFFICULTIES.</heading>

<p>He agreed with the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Merriman) when he deplored the fact that the nine men who had been deported from South Africa were sent to the Old Country to accentuate the troubles they had there. He thought all of them in that House had no desire to accentuate the difficulties that Great Britain was suffering under at the present time, but the right hon. gentleman omitted to mention that the very question which they were considering to-night was the cause of the troubles in Great Britain at present; and if the Government in the Old Country had been a little stronger, and they had taken an example from what was being done in this country, it would have been very much better for them. He would like to join with the Leader of the Opposition in strongly Urging upon the Government the necessity of bringing in legislation to prevent these disturbances from being repeated in South Africa, and he hoped the House would not rise until measures of that kind had been passed.

<p>Shall I say &#x201C;poisonous imputations&#x201D;&#x003F; (Laughter.) Proceeding, the hon. member quoted what Mr. Mason had said (that he wanted them to be like him, who sent the King, flag, and country to hell), and went on to say that an ex-Minister of the Crown might have had the sense and the goodwill or the taste&#x2014;call it what they liked&#x2014;to have poured oil on the troubled waters. The hon. member quoted from the &#x201C;Transvaal Leader&#x201D; a report of a speech of the hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Hull), who at a dinner had proposed the toast of South Africa, to the effect that that toast had become so threadbare that he was not going to say much about it; it was almost as threadbare as the first toast, but that toast would be honoured, when the first toast had been forgotten. Proceeding, the hon. member said that he was afraid, after that alarming statement, that the not quite complete. (Laughter.) He rose to give unstinted praise to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence for the <span class="col_653-654" refersTo="page_0333"/>way in which they had coped with the revolution on the Rand. He was sure he could not go back to his people if he had not got up and upheld the Government, in all their actions over the late strike. (Hear, hear.) He was bound to say that the Government had made one great mistake, and that was when they called someone in authority to arrest the hon. member for Jeppe (Mr. Creswell), who, as far as he knew, had been in Bulawayo in July, and ignored in January, and who had been discredited, and had to get himself arrested, and so he had written that document. (Laughter.) Dealing with Mr. Creswell's manifesto, which he read, the hon. member said that there had not been any attempt under Martial Law to make any man go back to work. The most extraordinary thing about the speeches which had been delivered in that House was that most hon. members agreed that the punishment fitted the crime, yet they said that these men ought to have been tried. Other hon. members had said that the Government was wrong, and then they said that they were going to vote for the second reading of the Bill. He could not understand that attitude. (Hear, hear.) The common every-day game of life was that a man was either for or against you. He hoped that those who were against the Government in regard to that matter, whether they were on his side of the House or on the other side, would not walk out of the House on the division for the second reading of the Bill, but would register their vote. (Ministerial cheers.) If the House could swallow the big thing, the declaration of Martial Law, they could swallow everything else, because everything else was consequential, therefore he was quite prepared to vote for the Bill. (Hear, hear.) He must admit that the Government had met the extraordinary circumstances extremely well. It was said that by deporting these men they were setting a precedent; that might be if-the Government were going to be there for all time. (Laughter.) The hon. member went on to say that the cause of all the unrest in the Transvaal had not come from within, but when a band of imported agitators had come to that country.</p>

<debateSection name="#agitators_not_wanted">

<heading>AGITATORS NOT WANTED.</heading>

<p>In the course of a speech then, he said they did not want a band of agitators and he hoped they would go back. It was not until this band of agitators came into their midst that there was a deliberate interference in the relationship between masters and men on the Rand. They came into a veritable Garden of Eden, and he pointed out that at that time men were working for better pay and better hours than they were at the present time. He could not hold the hon. members on the cross-benches blameless for what had happened. He could not hold them blameless for the men who were out of, work&#x2014;some of these had had a steady job with good pay for 20 years. Homes had been broken up, and while it was bad for the men it was hell for the women and children. Men were leaving for other countries, and he said that such a condition of affairs would never have come about had not the men sent these six members of the cross-benches to Parliament. From the first week in July the strike leaders dominated the whole of the Witwatersrand area. They practically tried to control the mines from the Trades Hall. Thousands of men joined the Unions for the sake of their own peace. These men had had experience of Labour leaders, and they had found them the hardest taskmasters in the world. Continuing he referred to the entry of the 11 Labour members on the Johannesburg Town Council, and said that they had destroyed the municipal life of Johannesburg, so much so that no decent fellow would go on the Johannesburg Town Council. A few who were there stuck there and said they would see the thing through. The late Mr. Dowell Ellis, the kindest and most courteous of Mayors, said that these 11 members had made his life a hell. One of the committees was broken up because these Labour members would not play the game. But they were not satisfied with all that; they wanted to make the Government subservient to their own ends. For years the Engine-drivers&#x2019; Society on the mines had been recognised and received special privileges.</p>

<p>People in other parts of the country had said that if the mines had only recognised the other societies none of this trouble would have occurred. But what did they do the last time&#x003F; They did not even take the trouble to vote, and sections of them would not work unless under certain conditions. They would never have ended the mischief by recognition of the Trade Unions. He went on to refer to the Premier Mine, where, he said, that 12 months ago the management introduced the pension scheme, gave the men special privileges, and there they lived a happy life. What did those men do&#x003F; It was only necessary to send a poodle dog&#x2014;not a Labour member&#x2014;and they came out immediately. No fewer than 386 of those men were now seeking employment.

<p>said that he was not going to delay the House, but he would merely state the reasons why he was going to support the Government for the actions they had taken under Martial Law. To the hon. member for Lady-brand he would like to say one or two things. That hon. member had made a most amusing speech; in fact it had proved more amusing than all the other speeches rolled together. He twitted hon. members on his (the speaker&#x2019;s) side of the House for supporting the Government on the present occasion. He was going to show that the hon. member should sit somewhere else than the place where he had been sitting lately. When he (the speaker) was elected to represent his constituency in the House, he said that no matter who brought in the legislation, he would support legislation that would be of the greatest benefit to the country. The Government had not introduced the legislation he was looking for, but the Bill before the House was one that he felt that he could support. The hon. member for Ladybrand had made some statements which had very much astonished him. He could not represent the action of the hon. member, sitting behind the hon. Minister as he was, as anything more than stabbing the Minister in the back. If there was such a split in the party opposite, if he and his friends were trying to oust the present Government to catch votes in different parts of the country, they should do it openly and take their seats on the cross-benches. (Ministerial cheers.) Years ago the hon. member was sitting behind the Ministers supporting them, and one of his friends was in the Ministry. Now they were doing all they could to discredit the Government, and for what purpose&#x003F; It was to get votes. What had Barbary ostriches to do with the matter then before the House&#x003F; Nothing at all. Proceeding, Mr. Oliver said that he happened to be in Johannesburg on the 4th and 5th of July, and he would like to tell the House a few of the things that came under his notice at that time. He was down at the Park Railway Station when the strikers came down. There were about 20 unarmed policemen, who had been many hours on duty. The House had been told that the strikers were very often provoked to violence by the action of the police, but there was no such provocation on this occasion. These policemen were stoned and forced to retire. It was said that those people were not strikers but hooligans, but the fact remained that a large number were wearing red ribbons and had pick-handles in their hands. They may not have been rioting themselves, but they did not try to stop those who were endeavouring to burn down the station. No; they prevented the police from doing their duty, and prevented the fire, brigade from trying to put out the fire. If they were not actually committing these acts themselves, if it had not been for their support such things would not have happened. They committed all kinds of acts of violence and all sorts of illegal acts. If they called that striking, the sooner they put a stop to it the better. (Cheers.)</p>

<heading>WHAT DO STRIKES MEAN&#x003F;</heading>

<p>Proceeding, he said he thought it was the hon. member for George Town who said that all the hon. members in that House except the hon. members on the cross-benches objected to strikes. If strikes meant laying down tools and refusing to work under certain conditions he thought he might say that they did not object, hut if it meant pulling out people who were satisfied with their pay and their conditions of work, if they allowed them to set fire to property and destroy property and to commit acts of violence, and stop communication and food supplies, then he could safely say that they objected to strikes, and in his opinion the Government should take action to see that such things as happened in July should not be repeated in this country. The question of the right to work had also been raised. It was because certain people in the Labour Party pulled out men who were willing to work that there was any objection. There was also the right to exist, and when one section of the community attempted to bring another section to their knees by taking the upper hand throughout the country it became the duty of the other section of the community to bind themselves together in defence. In January a very different state of affairs existed compared with July. In July the Government was taken by surprise, but they could be largely excused for that because the crisis was brought about so hurriedly and they never realised for one moment that the strikers would go to the excesses that they did. He was satisfied that the strikers meant a repetition in January on a larger scale than in July. They had the words of their leaders for that. One of them said: &#x201C;We commence in January where we left off in July.&#x201D; Well, they left off with violence, destruction of property, and bloodshed, and if they had made that statement that they were going to start in January where they left off in July, was not the Government acting rightly in seeing that such things were not allowed to be repeated. They would find at the exhibition which was being held in Cape Town that a new industry was started in January. At that exhibition there was a railway engine wheel, a portion <span class="col_657-658" refersTo="page_0335"/>of which had been blown out, and a piece of the rail itself, which had been blown out. Who started that new industry&#x003F; It was the strikers. If they were prepared to do that, then were they not prepared to do much more&#x003F;</p>

<p>The reason it was not done on a wholesale scale was not because they were not prepared to do so, or had not the means to do it. There was a sight, and he hoped the strikers and agitators would never forget it. He saw Boer and Briton bound together maintaining law and order throughout the country. (Cheers) They were bound together to protect the railway. That was one good thing that had come out of evil. That was the reason why there was no wholesale destruction of trains, loss of life and property. It was because the Minister of Defence, finding that the strike had broken out again, touched the button, and sent a flash flying over the country, and instantly, almost by magic, they saw the Defence Force and the burghers taking up pre-arranged positions, guarding property, and keeping the sections of the miners separate from each other. Boer and Briton supported the Government in upholding the law of the country. Proceeding, the hon. member said that he thoroughly endorsed the action of the Government in declaring Martial Law in January. He was convinced that if that had not been done there would have been a repetition on a larger scale of what took place in July. There was another statement made by hon. members on the cross-benches to which he would like to refer. They said that those who were really responsible for the crimes which had been committed were the occupants of the Treasury Benches. They said the Government was responsible for the hundreds of men who were leaving the country at the present time, but in his (Mr. Oliver&#x2019;s) opinion the cause of these men leaving the country was easily traceable to the Labour leaders. They induced these men who had no grievances to leave their work, and now they could not get employment, and the Government was being wrongly blamed.</p>

<heading>AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION.</heading>

<p>What was the pretence in this railway strike&#x003F; Had the men any grievances&#x003F; If they had brought forward any real grievances, he believed they would have got the support of a great section of the people in this country. The demand made by the representatives who waited upon the Minister was not that they should be given in-creased pay or reduced hours, but that the Government should not dismiss a single man from the railway. First of all, they stated that the Government must re-instate every man who had been dismissed, no matter what the cause of his dismissal was. If the Government had given way on that, they might as well have handed over the reins of Government to the Labour leaders. There was no excuse for this general strike, and he supported the action of the Government in refusing to place themselves in such an impossible position. He would like to ask the Labour leaders, if they desired to represent themselves as working in the interests of labour in this country, how were they to further their scheme of getting more white labour into the country when every strike meant that white labourers were thrown out of work, and fewer were employed in future&#x003F; He regretted to see white men going away from this country, and he contended that the fault lay with the leaders of the Labour Party. In his constituency there were a number of railwaymen, and he thought he could fairly claim that, but for the loyal action of the railwaymen at Kimberley, things would have been very much worse than they were, because it was owing to their action that the Government were able to run trains without any interruption from Cape Town to Johannesburg. Whilst referring to this matter, he would like to say that, although many grievances had already been put right, there were some that had not, and he maintained that if the railway employees were to be contented and do good work, it was the duty of the State to pay them a living wage, to treat them fairly, and, if they had any grievances, to give them an opportunity of bringing those grievances to headquarters, and, if proved to be real, to put them right. While they expected the railways to be run on business principles, they did not expect goods to be carried at a loss, which was made up by taking away from the pay of the railway-men, and they did not expect such a reduction in rates as not to allow a fair and living wage for the railwaymen. If there were men on the railway to-day who were not receiving a living wage, it was the duty of the Government to put that right. There were some things which it would be hard for the Government to justify. He thought they would find it hard to justify in the eyes of the people of this country if they placed orders for rolling stock across the waters which could be executed in the workshops in this country, and at the same time dismissed men from those workshops. An explanation had certainly been given by the Minister of Railways, but surely, when they were dismissing men, they could find work for those men to do. He could not justify to himself the placing of orders oversea for work which could be done in this country at the same price or anywhere near that price, and he contended that it was the duty of the Government to employ these men and keep them in the country, instead of allowing them to go to other parts of the world.</p>

<heading>VINDICTIVE ACTION DEPRECATED.</heading>

<p>He felt confident that the Government were desirous of meeting these things. The threat of the general strike in January was <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_0336"/>nipped in the bud, and put a stop to by the prompt action of the Government. They had come off victorious, they had been very successful, and they were supported by pretty well the whole of the inhabitants of this country. He did not suppose for a moment that they wished to be vindictive, and he appealed to them not to show any vindictive action towards the men who had been thrown out of work. As far as Martial Law was concerned, he gave his entire support to the Government. He was going to vote for the second reading of this Bill, although it included one or two things which came as a shock to him. When he heard that these nine men had been deported without trial, he felt that it was very unjust, but he came to the House which an open mind and, after hearing the statement of the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Railways and Harbours, he thought they had made out a good case up to that point. Afterwards he thought the case was somewhat weak. The Minister of Defence said there was no other adequate way of punishing these men and that they could not meet the disease of Syndicalism under existing laws. They had had many opinions from lawyers in that House on the subject, and he, as a layman, did not feel justified in giving an opinion upon it. The only thing of force that the Minister of Defence had said, as far as his judgment went, was something to the effect that in the then condition of the country, the maintenance of law and order demanded that these men should be deported. He knew that the Government acted in good faith, he believed they thought it was the best thing to do, and therefore he was going to support them in the deportation. At the same time he thought these men might have had a trial before a Martial Law Court or a special tribunal. They certainly deserved a great deal more than they got. To put it another way, he did not think they deserved what they got&#x2014;this free passage Home. He did not think that was a punishment fitting the crime. In his view, they ought to have received some more severe punishment than that. As to the question of exile, while he gave his vote entirely to the Government for the second reading of this Bill, including the deportation, he wished to make it perfectly clear that if any suggestion were made in that House of any other action that would meet the case he reserved to himself a free vote after listening to all the arguments and objections brought forward when they came to clause 4. He should support the Government because he felt that they deserved the thanks of this country for the action they took in saving it from the bloodshed and revolution with which it was threatened, (Cheers.)</p>

<heading>THE DUTY OF THE GOVERNMENT.</heading>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. G. W. GROBLER</person> (Rustenburg)</from>

<p>declared that he had very little sympathy with people who tried to create disturbances and to bring business of all sorts to a stand still. He had said the same thing before, and he accordingly approved of the steps which the Government had taken in, order to preserve peace and order. The public also supported the Government in that, for they felt that the disturbances of last July ought not to be repeated. When the Ministers signed the contract in the Carlton Hotel with the people who had caused those disturbances the whole people had felt humiliated. The public were also disposed to help the Government because of the great Kafir peril. It was known that if the mines were closed down and the natives sent home, this would cause heavy loss to the country. In addition to that, the sending away of thousands of Kafirs would cause great danger to the Kafirs on the farms. The intention of the strikers to call in the aid of the Kafirs was intensely disapproved of by the general public. The Government needed to make no excuses for having proclaimed Martial Law. In July the armed forces of the country had been bombarded with stones and bottles, and then there was no Martial Law. He was really surprised that they had waited so long before proclaiming it. The burghers would not have remained still so long. That affair by itself was sufficient to justify the Government in introducing Martial Law. It had taught the strikers that they had got to behave themselves. Its result was to damp down the strike without the shedding of a drop of blood.</p>

<p>The Minister had alleged that there was a conspiracy, whilst others denied it. For his (the speaker&#x2019;s) part he did not believe there was any conspiracy. But why did the Minister wish to prove the, existence of a complot &#x003F; Syndicalism was itself an economic conspiracy. The leaders of that movement wanted to alarm the public to such a degree that the existing order of things could be destroyed. In the work by Sir Henry Clay called &#x201C;Syndicalism and Labour,&#x201D; Syndicalism was said to be the taking from those who had and who paid wages, and the giving of those who had not and who received wages. In Paris they had recently a Syndicalist at the head of the electric current supply, and he kept the town for a whole year in a state of alarm, cutting the town&#x2019;s supply of light off whenever he felt inclined. The people in Johannesburg wanted to go to work in the same way, in order to get their demands agreed to.</p>

<p>The Government was not entirely free from blame with regard to the signing of the treaty in July, as appeared from the report of the Commission; but owing to the manner in which they had since put down the strike they had recovered the prestige of the whole people. In this country they knew nothing of Syndicalism and strikes, and yet the Government had so handled the matter that, they had won the approval of the whole world.</p>

<p>In view of those facts he was very sorry indeed that he was bound to disapprove of the deportations without trial. He was not <span class="col_661-662" refersTo="page_0337"/>sorry for the men themselves who had suffered deportation, but he feared that a dangerous precedent had been created. Let them assume for a moment that they had presently another Government who favoured, for example, the nationalisation of land, that an agitation was started against it, and that feelings on the subject became strong. Could not the Government, in such a case, deport those persons who opposed themselves to the nationalisation of the land &#x003F; It had been stated that people who had been born in the country could not be sent away from it, but for his part he could not see any difference between the two. The deportation of persons born in the country was wholly illegal, and the deportation of people not born in the country was neither more nor less but equally illegal. If they could do the one, so they could do the other. As time went on it would be found that the unlawful deportations would more and more overshadow the good that the Government had done. He had heard some time ago of plans of that kind, but thought with the hon. member for Fort Beaufort that a Bill would be introduced to the House giving the Government power to deport, and that evidence would be laid before them showing that deportation was necessary. The act would then have been a legal one, and he would have been able to vote for it. But it was wrong to send the men away first, and ask for approval of the act afterwards. There was now nothing further to be done.</p>

<p>He deplored most earnestly the attack which had been made by the Minister of Finance on the hon. member for Smithfield. The speaker knew the abilities of the Minister, had known him for fifteen years, and had always regarded him as one of his best friends; but thought that he coupled chivalry with his talents, and was accordingly very disappointed that he should have tried to connect the hon. member for Smithfield with the strike movement. Why had the Minister dished up that stale report in its original flavour and colour, a report which he knew perfectly well was totally devoid of any truth&#x003F; If they had known there was going to be a strike, there would have been no congress at Bloemfontein. Of course, they would not knowingly have allowed themselves to be let in a trap. It was unfair to spread the report that the hon. member was coming with a commando of 5,000 men to help the strikers. The Minister apparently thought that if he threw enough mud some of it would certainly stick. It was unworthy of him to repeat the rumour in that House. Was the Minister able to give them the assurance that the report was not spread by persons who had reasons for wishing to bring the hon. member for Smith-field under the suspicions of the public&#x003F;</p>

<p>The speaker would like to know whether in the eyes of the Prime Minister he also was one of the active lieutenants of the hon. member for Smithfield. If not, he was satisfied; but if so, then it was only fair that where they reproached the hon. member for the ill actions of his sympathisers&#x2014; as the Prime Minister had done in the case of the alleged statements by the hon. member for Uitenhage, they should credit him in like manner with their good actions. At a public meeting shortly after the first strike the speaker had stated that, no matter what their differences might be, they had to support the Government through thick and thin, so far as was necessary in order to suppress public tumults. And with regard to the last strike, although he was not one of those who was liable to be called up under the Defence Force Act, he had immediately placed himself at the disposal of his commandant if required, and had also encouraged the burghers to offer their services voluntarily, in order to show the strikers that they must expect no sympathy for disturbances from the people in the country districts.</p>

<p>He hoped the whole thing would be a lesson for all of them. A rebellion had to be suppressed with violence, but he did not believe that violence alone would solve the difficulty. History showed them that power and violence had never produced anything of abiding value. South Africa was a good example of that. The man who said twelve years ago that the neck of Afrikanderdom would have to be broken, and who had the power of an Empire behind him with which to break it, was to-day a forgotten dignitary, whilst the same people whose necks were to be broken were ruling in South Africa.</p>

<p>The Labour movement with which they had now to do was a world movement, and it was impossible to dispose of such a question by deporting nine men. If they wanted to settle such a question they would have to examine into the causes of such a movement and see whether or not there were grievances which could be removed, or ameliorated. In that way they would free such a movement from danger, for although they would never satisfy the leaders&#x2014;they would look for grievances if there were not any&#x2014;they would be able to satisfy the great bulk of the people, who would refuse to follow their leaders in any subsequent attempt to make trouble, for it was quite impossible to say that all the strikers were unreasonable beings. There was another reason why the way he had indicated should be followed, and it was this, that the Labour Party here had practically no chance to get into power, because the class from which they got their followers in other countries, that was to say, the people who did its daily work, consisted in this country of natives. If the persons who had the power failed to treat the workmen with sympathy the men would necessarily come to the conclusion that there remained only one way open to them, and that was by direct action, by strikes, etc.</p>

<p>Well, he intended to vote for the second reading, but when the Bill afterwards came into Committee it would be necessary to <span class="col_663-664" refersTo="page_0338"/>delete everything from it which might afterwards be used as a reproach against the people. It had been said that no Government could deport people unless the opinion of the public was in favour of it, but Parliament could confer such power on a Government, and Parliament did not always represent the will of the public. Assume for a moment that the Government wished afterwards to repeat such an action and that the majority of the public was opposed to it, an obedient majority in the Parliament would still approve of the act. There would then remain only two ways open to the public. The one was to submit, however dissatisfied they might be, and the other was to rise in rebellion against Parliament and the lawful authorities, and so follow the methods of the South American Republics, as had been stated by the right hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. Merriman). The nation in South Africa was still a young one. They should keep its history inviolate and do nothing for which they would afterwards have to blush.</p>

<p>said he felt it incumbent upon himself to say a few words with regard to the question before the House. When a great national crisis occurs the ordinary party differences fall to pieces for the time being, and that was how he felt on the question. They had been passing through a crisis, a crisis in which the minority of the land, who had their rights he supposed, sought to impose their authority on the majority, on Parliament, and the Government. The question was whether they were going to rule or whether the Government and the Parliament of this country were going to rule.</p>

<debateSection name="#a_debt_of_gratitude">

<heading>A DEBT OF GRATITUDE.</heading>

<p>He felt they owed a debt of gratitude to the Government, despite their mistakes for settling the crisis in the only possible way. However allowable strikes may be by those who were not treated well with regard to pay or conditions of work, the idea of Syndicalism was an evil of so pernicious a character that it was a great blessing to any country, and certainly to a young country like the Union of South Africa, that Government at the very commencement of its career would not allow such things to occur, and were determined to put them down with every power at their disposal. He had much sympathy for the legitimate grievances of the working-man, but in his opinion the hon. members on the cross-benches had been the very men who had hindered those grievances &#x201C;being redressed. They had often tacked on to resolutions which were worthy of support, matters which one could not support. They had brought their resolutions before the House for vote-catching purposes. He hoped as the result of this great turmoil there would be a new departure, and that where any real grievances existed they would be redressed. With regard to the railways, it did not seem the right thing, when a large sum of money had been lost to the railways by lowering the rates paid by farmers and merchants, that the loss should be put on the shoulders of the working-men on the railway. He thought that the Government should be very careful about that matter of retrenchment, but when the representatives of the Trades Federation demanded not only that retrenchment should cease, but that those who had been retrenched should be taken back, they could not expect the Government to tolerate that ultimatum. It was the intention to bring about a general strike. It was clear that the Government did not realise the gravity of the situation in July. The Syndicalists thought that South Africa was a fitting place to carry out a great experiment, they thought that the Government, and the people were innocent and ignorant people, and there was some justification for their thinking so. The Government did not see through it in July, and was brought to its knees. Nevertheless, in his opinion, the agreement they made was the best under the circumstances in the interests of the country. The Syndicalists looked upon that as a victory, and they were encouraged to go forward with the idea that a general strike was becoming possible. The Prime Minister had spoken about the native peril in July, but he ought to have told the House how well the natives behaved. There certainly was a danger of the ideas spreading along to the natives and their getting out of hand, and for that reason he (Mr. Schreiner) approved of the plans made for the natives being sent to their homes. There was an idea of a strike in the native mind, but he did not know by whom it was implanted. If the natives struck work and went out of the mines, very few of them would go back, and their places would be filled by cheap labour from the South of Europe. At the recent Native Congress although a paper was read which was an incitement to strike, the delegates did not act on the propositions made, but passed on to the next business. If these things had been mentioned by the Prime Minister in his speech nine days ago, different ideas as to the feelings and action of the natives would have gone abroad not only in South Africa but to the world. He was speaking at the first opportunity he had had to show that the-representatives of the natives in South Africa in congress would have nothing to do with strikes. It was true that some native men had attempted to strike for better pay, but the responsible people-were against the strike, and should be given the credit for that. It certainly would have been a dreadful thing if 300,000 natives had been let loose through the country, but they must not forget that amongst the people in those compounds there were a large number who would not misbehave themselves. There were many respectable <span class="col_665-666" refersTo="page_0339"/>and God-fearing men amongst them, and although there was a criminal section they should be careful not to tar the whole four millions with the same brush.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#loyalty_of_natives">

<heading>LOYALTY OF NATIVES.</heading>

<p>At that Native Congress resolutions were passed and sent to the Government expressing the loyalty of the natives and their irrelation to the strike movement, and praying for the Government to give protection from the strikers. The Prime Minister, in January, complimented them on their loyalty, and told them that so long as they obeyed the mine managers they would be protected, but if not, then the hand of the law would come down heavily on those who disobeyed. He (Mr. Schreiner) had taken the greatest interest in the movement set forward by the Syndicalists, and had studied the position as it gradually evolved itself. He knew the tradesman whose store was burnt down at Benoni, and had heard the various details of the lawless acts done in that town. He had come to the conclusion that as to the people who were at the bottom of the strike and were responsible for stirring up the people to commit crimes in the name of liberty, the best thing was to deport them, and that things would never be right until the leaders of the movement had been sent out of the country. He had felt that this was a movement which ought to be crushed by the authorities. They might call it conspiracy if they wished, but it was Syndicalism, endeavouring to bring the whole of the country to its heel. There was no doubt in his mind that if the Government had not acted quickly there would have been a far worse state of things in the country in January than what took place in July, which was only a sectional disturbance. If once the railway communication had been stopped the country would have been brought to its knees, and if this had occurred all that had been prophesied by the deported men would have been fulfilled, because there is no doubt that a great number of the workmen would have followed the Syndicalists. That being so, after a time the people of the country would have called upon the Government to give in, and that was no doubt the object of the strike leaders. An industrial war was just as bad as any other war. But this was a war undertaken not for the redress of grievances, but simply to give the strike leaders and their small following the power to rule the rest of the country. The words &#x201C;Industrial Republic&#x201D; were not too strong an expression to indicate what was meant, and he thought the Government were quite justified in the action they had taken. To his mind there were only two alternatives, one was to believe what the cross-benches had told them that the Government had formed a conspiracy to crush Labour and the Labour leaders and deport them, and the other was that this was a definite plan of a junto of Labour leaders to secure control of the country for the purpose of Syndicalism. In choosing as to who were the real conspirators the case of the Government was incalculably stronger than that put forward by the cross-benches. Personally, he would not have retrenched the railway men had he been the Minister of Railways, because it was playing into the hands of the strike leaders and making it a grievance which threw the men into the hands of the Syndicalists. He had listened to almost every speech that had been made in that debate, and had been willing to accept new light, but he saw no reason why the Government should not be indemnified for proclaiming Martial Law and calling out the Defence Force. He had been surprised at the methods which the Government had adopted in deporting these men. He had thought the Government would have introduced a Bill to deport them while keeping them in the country. He could not agree with the Minister when he said that such a Bill would not have been passed, because he (Mr. Schreiner) believed that the same majority that was going to pass the Indemnity Bill, and perhaps even a bigger majority, would have supported it. But while not agreeing with the method which the Government had adopted he was nevertheless going to support the Bill, because he believed that the deportation of these men was necessary and going to be the salvation of the country. He would like to have more evidence about some of the men, but if there was a movement which had to be crushed in this way then all those who were connected with it were responsible, and there was sufficient evidence to link these nine men with responsibility in the movement.</p>

<debateSection name="#banishment_of_the_deportees">

<heading>BANISHMENT OF THE DEPORTEES.</heading>

<p>When they came to the question of banishment, he must confess that he could not understand the people who said they were entirely in favour of deporting these people, but said they should not be banished and should be allowed to come back. He supposed these people would like them to be deported for three months, six months, or a year. If he were absolutely satisfied that these men should be deported and that they were dangerous to the peace and welfare of the nation, he could not see why they should ever be allowed to come back again. He did not bind himself to that view, but, as he at present felt, after listening carefully to all the arguments that had been brought forward these men should be kept out of the country. In the course of the debate one or two things had been said which he thought ought not to have been said. One was in regard to South Africa and the Empire. They all, of course, said &#x201C;South Africa first,&#x201D; because self-preservation was the first law of Nature, but he did not think the point need have been emphasized <span class="col_667-668" refersTo="page_0340"/>in the way it had been. Some members spoke of the deportations, and the calling out of the Burgher Forces and what took place under Martial Law, as if racial feelings were being aroused again. On the contrary, he rejoiced that this was the first real thing that had happened for bringing the two races together. Apart from the people under the sway of the Labour leaders and the Syndicalists, the country was against the action of the Syndicalists, and in favour of the Government&#x2019;s action, and they had seen the two races making a united stand against the common foe which had arisen to the welfare of society. One of the members on the cross-benches had spoken of keeping the natives in the kraals. They all knew what that meant&#x2014;keeping the natives from the mines. They would never succeed in getting a great labour movement in South Africa if that were the view they took of the labouring portion of the people of this country. All their pratings of freedom and liberty were vitiated by the fact that they wanted to impose the opposite of all this on the coloured and native population. He had no doubt that what had happened would be a lesson to everybody in this country. It would be a lesson to the Europeans, and also to the coloured and native population, because they would see that the Government did not intend at any time to allow a section of the population, however valuable they were, to ride roughshod over the rights and welfare of the rest of the population. He hoped that when this turmoil was over, there would be a really earnest endeavour on the part of the Government and Parliament to deal with any genuine and legitimate grievances that were in existence. He hoped that not only this Government, but all future Governments in the Union, in the carrying on of the work of the Union&#x2014;the railways, for instance&#x2014; would not only think of pounds, shillings, and pence, and that the carrying on of the railways on business principles would not be interpreted to mean that the employees should be made to suffer loss in order that the receipts should be swollen. He believed there should be legislation which would make it clear that even what was allowed in ether countries, even what was allowed in the Old Country, was unsuitable for South Africa, and that Syndicalism would not be allowed a free hand, that this country set its face against such a thing as a general strike or a sympathetic strike, and that, above all, the country was determined, and Parliament was determined, that its protecting hand should be over every man&#x2014; white, coloured, or black&#x2014;who desired to labour and that no man should be allowed to interfere with him.

<speech by="#wilcocks">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. T. M. WILCOCKS</person> (Fauresmith)</from>

<p>said the speeches delivered had been of such a diverse character that it was difficult to come to a conclusion, though if they examined the facts themselves it was easy enough to decide. Ten years ago the country was happy in that it knew nothing of strikes, but now their difficulties were not even confined to ordinary strikes. The strikes they had were of such a character the world had not hitherto had experience of. Grievances ought to be ventilated only in a constitutional manner, otherwise a vast deal of injury would be caused to all industries. He took it for granted that everybody was willing to help the workman so long as the latter went to work in a reasonable way and was willing to accept help. Capitalists ought to see that they were dependent on labour, and conversely the same. Strikes now appeared to have become the fashion in the country, but in that way they only handicapped progress. How could they possibly expect people to invest their capital in this country if it was found impossible to preserve the peace&#x003F; If it came to a ballot, the great bulk of the working-men would vote against a strike. With reference to the July occurrences he felt that the Government had shown themselves to be very weak, but in January they had taken action in a proper manner. If those disturbances had not been at once suppressed the danger would have grown greater, and the Government were therefore very largely to blame for the occurrences of July. Of course, what had been done in January would cost them a lot of money. Perhaps it had not been necessary to proclaim Martial Law everywhere, but notwithstanding that fact he was prepared to give a certain measure of approval to what had been done. He hoped the old commando spirit would long continue to flourish. The Government were asking for an indemnity not only for what was done under Martial Law but also for what was done prior to the Proclamation, and he thought that was going too far.</p>

<p>How was it possible, he asked, to approve everything the Government had done&#x003F; The eyes of the world had been directed to South Africa, and they would do well therefore to be prudent in creating precedents. He quite failed to understand how the Government could deport the men without giving them a trial. The Minister of Defence had stated that the existing laws were too gentle, and that the courts of justice and Parliament were unsuitable bodies to decide such a matter. Well, that was going too far. Assuming, however, that the Minister was right, why did not the Government appoint a special tribunal for the purpose of trying these men&#x003F; Hon. members were placed in a serious difficulty in having to deal with a Bill which covered both the Proclamation of Martial Law and the deportations as well. So far as the proclaiming of Martial Law went he was able to approve of it, but felt the strongest objections to the taking of such a drastic step as deportation <span class="col_669-670" refersTo="page_0341"/>of the offenders without trial. He trusted therefore that they would in Committee agree to appoint a tribunal consisting of the Chief justice and two other judges to decide this question. The complexion given to the Jagersfontein occurrences by the Minister was a little exaggerated, the rising amongst the Kafirs having been practically suppressed by the time the burghers and the military forces arrived. He admitted that the burghers deserved all praise for the readiness with which they replied to the call for armed help. The occurrence showed clearly how necessary it was that the Government should take measures as speedily as possible to secure their effective arming. (Hear, hear.)</p>

<p>He failed to understand why the Minister of Defence had dragged the hon. member for Smithfield into the affair. A good deal had been said about hon. members who wanted to make political capital out of these occurrences, but so far as he (the speaker) was concerned he did not care a rush for political capital. The Minister of Defence had taken it amiss that the hon. member for Smithfield had stated on July 20, in the course of a speech, that it was the Government&#x2019;s duty to do something more than protect life and property, and that it was the duty of the Government to protect the poor against the rich. What harm was there in that&#x003F;</p>

<p>Working-men would have to be protected against injustice, and it was the duty of the Government to see that they lived happily. Well, could they see anything very wrong in that&#x003F; There had been a lot of talk about the poor white, and if the thing could be done with talking they would all have been made millionaires by this time. The Minister of Finance was annoyed that the hon. member for Smithfield spoke in that way on the 20th July. But the Prime Minister spoke on the 11th July at Losberg, and said that the workmen must be satisfied and made happy, and it was the duty of the mine-owners to see that their workmen were satisfied. What was the difference between the Prime Minister and the hon. member for Smithfield&#x003F; Which of the two had done wrong&#x003F; From the one side they were told it was a sin, but not from the other side. Why was that&#x003F; The Minister of Finance had spoken in a disparaging manner of a congress of representatives of the people, and had described it as a comedy, and added some references to foreign adventurers. Had the Minister the right to speak in that way&#x003F; Had not the hon. member for Smithfield given an explanation of his expressions&#x003F; The hon. member for Smithfield had been generous enough to preserve silence on the subject, but the Minister of Finance was not. The Minister of Railways and Harbours also had described the Bloemfontein Congress as ridiculous, and said that no business of importance was transacted at it. Well, the future would teach them that. How was it that the Minister of Finance had so suddenly got the hon. member for Smithfield on the brain, quoting him in the course of his speech no less than six times. The hon. member for Smithfield, with 5,000 burghers, on the way to Johannesburg. What nonsense! They did not expect things of that sort from a Minister. Such statements were unworthy of him, and he ought to have known better. And then he found it necessary to talk about blatant patriots. There ought to be an end of that sort of thing.</p>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VENTER</person> (Wodehouse)</from>

<p>said his constituency was bounded on two sides by native territory, and it was his duty therefore to make known his opinions on the subject. The Bill was of great importance, and he was much astonished to find that the lawyers were not in agreement with regard to it. The hon. member for Albany had clearly explained the real position when he said that extraordinary circumstances demanded extraordinary measures. The hon. member for Uitenhage had stated that the members of the Government were making election speeches, but that was exactly what the hon. member himself had done. He stood with one foot in the boat belonging to the Labour Party and the other foot in the boat belonging to the hon. member for Smithfield.</p>

<p>Whatever might happen in the world off labour, it was quite certain that the country population were not going to allow themselves to be trodden in the dust. Who was the true leader of the Labour Party&#x003F; It appeared to him that it was the hon. member for Ladybrand. There was a conspiracy in the House. The hon. member had brought the debate down to a very low level and the country ought to take note of the fact. He said that 70,000 burghers had been called up in order to oppose 5,000 strikers, but the fact was that the former were required in order to watch the railways.</p>

<p>The Government had been charged with negligence, but nobody had thought it possible that such circumstances could arise. He felt bound, therefore, to indemnify the Government for everything they had done. He was in favour of free labour, and objected to the posting of pickets, or to any hindrance being placed in the way of those who were willing to work. It was in order to protect those people that the burghers were called out, with the result that the strike died a sudden death. In January the Government had acted as the country had expected they would, and it had not been proved by any hon. member that the Government had done anything in bad faith. The Government had, in fact, done everything in good faith. It was true some trifling matters had been complained of, but they did not weigh against the general interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>The speaker went on to refer to public-meetings which he had attended, and at which it had been declared that the best thing would be to deport the leaders. The ship ought, he said, to have been more fully <span class="col_671-672" refersTo="page_0342"/>laden, and if matters did not go properly they would have to despatch another ship. Banishment was the proper thing to do, for it was impossible to provide such people with pleasure excursions. Those people who had been inciting the natives had been playing with dynamite, a most deplorable thing to do.</p>

<p>The speaker concluded by deprecating the speeches which had been made by hon. members who seized every opportunity to attack the Government. It was their duty to protect the Government, and they had failed to do that. The Labour Party was opposed to the Government, but that was not the right way to get their grievances removed.</p>

<p>deprecated the remarks of Mr. Wilcocks in again dragging the old trouble across the floor of the House. They wanted rest and peace in this country, and he strongly denounced the action of certain hon. members who had, against all etiquette, addressed meetings in the constituencies of other members. (Hear, hear.) He held that the troubles of July and January had been created by the troubles which the Government had had last year. He would remind hon. members of the old saying, &#x201C;A house divided against itself cannot stand.&#x201D; Dealing with the trouble itself, he urged the proper training and winning of the burghers. &#x201C;If you want peace,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;prepare for war.&#x201D; They could no longer draw on the Imperial troops, therefore it was their duty to see to it that their own forces were properly trained. The hon. member proceeded to deal with &#x201C;the tyranny of the Trades Hall,&#x201D; and stated that if the deported men had done elsewhere one-tenth of what they had done here they would have been deported long ago. He held the Government had done a great deal to help the poor man, and referred to what had been done for labourers on the railway, many of whom, he said, were now in a happy and prosperous position. The hon. member proceeded to refer to the native aspect of the question, which he considered the most serious.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. VAN DER WALT</person> (Pretoria District, South)</from>

<p>said he was well acquainted with the condition of affairs, as he lived in the neighbourhood of the Rand. Every hon. member ought to make known his views, though no doubt the debate was becoming monotonous, the Bill having already been under consideration for nearly a month. Last year the hon. member for Jeppe had proposed a motion of no confidence in the Government. The motion had gone through the country, and the strike had arisen from it. A good deal of criticism had been directed to the actions of the Government in Juy last, and it was easy to be wise after the event. Action had to be taken on the instant. So far as concerned the complaints about low wages, he was in favour of increasing wages, but it would have to be done in a proper manner. Now the strike had been suppressed, it would certainly not occur again for the next twenty years.</p>

<p>Some hon. members were able to approve the proclamation of Martial Law, but were unable to approve of the deportations. He could not understand that. He supported the Bill and intended to vote for it, so that the people now on the water might stay away. They must be kept out of the country, and if there were still more people of the same kind they ought to go, too.</p>

<p>The hon. member for George Town had made some remarks about the burghers who did service in Germiston, but he forgot that whilst he was peacefully sleeping they were keeping watch. The speaker could not believe all those complaints, for the burghers, had behaved themselves well.</p>

<p>Many of the burghers were entirely unarmed and others insufficiently armed. He thought the Government should properly arm the people in the neighbourhood of the goldfields.</p>

<speech by="#kuhn">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. G. KUHN</person> (Prieska)</from>

<p>said the time had arrived when they must cease to be silent. Although they Laughed, the affair was a most serious one. The Bill was going to become law. But that would not finish it, as for many a long year to come they would point the finger at that Bill. Twelve years ago he belonged to those in the Cape House of Assembly who strongly disapproved of Martial Law, the objections arising out of their conviction that grave injustices were being committed under it. Now that they were in the majority it was their duty to take care that no similar injustice should take place. It was their duty to guard against injustice. Were there no people who had delivered something for which there must be payment&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town, Harbour, had said a good deal about the illegalities, but the Government had acknowledged that their actions were illegal. It was necessary to draw a distinction between law and justice. It was necessary to put an end to the illegal acts, and take care that they could not happen again.</p>

<p>Then a good deal had also been said on the subject of grievances, but nobody had explained what they were. The members of the Labour Party had given a few examples, but those were not real grievances. If people had objections to the railway service, they could leave it. Everyone was free to resign when he thought fit. It was impossible to compel the Government to retain officials against its will.</p>

<p>The members of the Labour Party were opposed to the Government. They spoke with contempt of the Government, and said the Government had no heart for the working-man. During the first session of Parliament those hon. members had stated that the natives on the mines should be replaced by whites. That would make <span class="col_673-674" refersTo="page_0343"/>things easier for a general strike. Well, it had not been successful, and so they had set to work to incite the Kafirs. That was so mean that at first he had been unable to believe it. And yet the Labour Party still made out that they were acting on behalf of the poor whites. If the Government had failed to take drastic steps, what, he asked, would have happened in this country&#x003F; How was it possible that the Government had agreed that the hon. member for Springs should be appointed on the Select Committee to deal with native affairs&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN NIEKERK</person> (Boshof)</from>

<p>considered that very little remained to be said on the subject before the House. If the Government had taken sharp action in July they would not have heard anything more of the question. Whilst the storm was brewing the Minister of Railways and Harbours went on a journey to England, whilst at the same time the Minister of Mines and Industries held a meeting in Malmesbury. The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister were obliged to take over the work of the other Ministers. That was how it came about that they did not get done till January what ought to have been done in July. Like all Afrikanders, he felt sympathy with the working-men, but the day had not yet arrived when it was possible to grant them everything they asked for. Their grievances ought to be settled in a constitutional manner, and not with the accompaniment of violence and disorder. Their thanks were due to the burghers who had stood so faithfully beside the Government, for despite all personal difficulties they had not hesitated to respond to the call. He hoped the Government would not forget that. Some of them had not even got rifles, whilst others had suffered personal losses. He could not understand why the burghers had to be commandeered whilst the mine-workers of Koffyfontein, Blaauwbosch, and Elandsput were able to go peacefully to sleep. With regard to Martial Law and the way in which it had been carried out, he intended fully to support the Government. But with regard to the deportations, he came to the conclusion that the Government had done an unconstitutional thing, though different lawyers had expressed different views on the subject, It had been stated that the will of the people was the highest law, but they must not forget that justice ought to prevail. The Government had done a thing which had never been done before.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence had dragged a man into the debate who ought not to have been dragged into it at all. The House was told of some rumour about the hon. member for Smith-field, to the effect that he was going to Johannesburg at the time of the first strike at the head of 5,000 men. They had no right whatever to drag the name of the hon. member into the debate in that manner. It had been very painful to him (the speaker). Moreover, it was unfair. Did they want to give the public a wrong impression, to do further hurt to the feelings of the hon. member for Smithfield, or was it all done from political motives&#x003F; If so, that would be a deplorable thing. Why did the Prime Minister use such expressions&#x003F; And then the Minister of Finance talked of what he called blatant patriots. The speaker did not know what that meant, but the best commandants in the Free State belonged to them. And all the 500 persons who were present at the congress at Bloemfontein went to fetch their rifles and offered themselves for service under the Government. He himself had personally done the same thing, and that was why he felt pained at the remark which the Minister had made. They must forgive the hon. member for Vrededorp, as he did not know what he was doing. The hon. member did not know what he wanted, though he was ready to give advice. He should keep it to himself.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Edenburg had already pointed out where the danger lay, namely, in the speeches of the hon. members for Fauresmith and Ladybrand. It was a prophetic look. If that was all the hon. member knew, he would have done better to preserve silence. The coolie question, scab, everything was held at the door of the blatant patriot. It was unfair and unworthy of the hon. member.</p>

<p>It was not easy to come to a decision, but when it was once done, it should be done in a manly way. He was unable to approve of any action which was unconstitutional and illegal. He trusted it would not form a precedent.</p>

<p>said that while he thought the Government proclaimed Martial Law in the best interests of the country, he must vote against deportation without trial, and he hoped the Government would introduce some sort of amendment so that these people might come back and be placed on trial. He did not think that all the opposition had come from members genuinely opposed to the Bill, but from members who were opposed to the Government and took the opportunity of attacking the Government. (Hear, hear.) He had many notes, but he thought he would create a record by making the shortest speech. (Hear, hear.)</p>

<speech by="#meyler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. MEYLER</person> (Weenen)</from>

<p>said he thought that some members had failed to grasp essential details of the Bill they were debating. The first point was that it was quite unnecessary to bring in a Bill in order to get Martial Law taken off, a Proclamation would be quite sufficient to effect this purpose. He proceeded <span class="col_675-676" refersTo="page_0344"/>to quote authorities to show that Martial Law should only be put in force where there was an insurrection or a state of war. He had hoped that the Minister would give them his full case to explain the necessity for Martial Law in Natal and the Free State. He pointed out that the fines under Martial Law in these two Provinces amounted to &#x00A3;15, and he dealt with cases where men were arrested without charges being preferred. He also pointed out that certain Labour candidates for the Provincial Council in Natal had received more support than they would have done had they not been arrested and released without charges being preferred. He declared that Natal had suffered owing to Martial Law, and said that the credit of a place like Durban would be badly damaged in consequence of what had happened. Natal had suffered, and the pampered part of the Union&#x2014;the Cape&#x2014;had gained. As a matter of fact, he thought that the Proclamation of Martial Law had not been necessary. He alleged that the law was proclaimed in Natal so as to give the Government a clear way to the sea, and that arrangements for what had taken place in Natal were made early in December. So far as the deportations were concerned, the Government had tried to get into communication with shipping companies in December to make preparations for the sending away of certain passengers. The hon. member then went on to refer to the Benoni meeting, and traced the history of what happened, quoting the correspondence that had passed between the parties concerned. He also mentioned the running of special trains and the conveyance of over 1,600 people to a district that was already inflamed. He thought that these matters should have been clearly placed before the House by the Minister. The hon. member said that, while it was difficult to find out what happened at Benoni, so far as the Market-square meeting was concerned, he was present and saw what had happened. He said that the meeting was proclaimed in the &#x201C;Star,&#x201D; but everybody did not possess a tickey.</p>

<heading>&#x201C;A HORRIBLE DISPLAY OF FORGE.&#x201D;</heading>

<p>He felt very mad when he saw the horrible display of force. (Labour cheers.) The crowd could have been kept moving without any difficulty, and speeches could have been delivered. He had heard 50 times as strong speeches delivered in Hyde Park on a Sunday morning, as were made by the deported men&#x2014; (Labour cheers)&#x2014;and still Britain remained an Empire. Reference had been made to the presence of drunken men in the Market-square, but he did not see a single one. As to the trolley incident, a speech was delivered by Mr. Morgan, a fellow countryman of his, of whom he felt very proud on that occasion. Mr. Morgan deserved a V.C. for attempting to get the crowd to obey the order to disperse. (Labour cheers.) He was followed by Mr. Bain, who made a violent speech. It was grossly unfair that a man who behaved like Mr. Morgan on this occasion should have been treated as he had been. (Labour cheers.) It was the sight of the police, went on Mr. Meyler, that led to the trouble. Once the hooligans started to throw stones, however, the police were quite justified in doing what they did. At night the hooligan element took charge of the town, and the military and police were perfectly justified when they started to fire and if innocent people suffered it was their own fault, as they had no business to be there. On the following day matters became worse. The troops behaved in a most restrained fashion, never firing without provocation. He was bitterly disappointed when he heard that an armistice had been concluded, for the police and military had perfect control of the situation. Referring to the revolver incident, Mr. Meyler said the public had been misled as to it by Mr. Poutsma and others. It arose through the narrowly-averted disaster of the police shooting on the crowd after the armistice had been concluded. Had that happened, no doubt revolvers would have been used and Ministers might have been shot. The English Press stated that the trouble had cost the Union a million but an article in the &#x201C;Cape Times&#x201D; had put the expenditure down at &#x00A3;100,000. It was a pity that Government had not stated the amount in the House, as a section of the English press were reiterating that the men had scored a signal victory, for they had only lost a week&#x2019;s wages, whilst the Government had lost &#x00A3;1,000,000. Continuing, Mr. Meyler said the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Madeley) had been unfairly treated. Hon. members who had attacked him had not remained to hear his defence. As to the alleged boycotting of the Judicial Commission, the hon. member remembered that another Commission, still sitting in South Africa, had been boycotted by the Indian community because they considered that certain members of the Commission had prejudiced the case, and he noticed that the Bishop of Zanzibar was inclined to take the same course about the Commission appointed to enquire into certain Church troubles in Central Africa&#x2014;so they were in good company.</p>

<p>The elected man of the railway workers had been seized and sent oversea, and that was hardly the best way of getting discontent away from the railway service. They were putting a premium on the formation of secret societies which would be a real danger to the community. When a man was retrenched his whole means of living were taken away; and there should be no retrenchment on the railways unless it was absolutely necessary, and there were no other means of economising. Could not some other arrangements be made, such as putting the men on the land&#x003F; It was not allowable for <span class="col_677-678" refersTo="page_0345"/>men on the railways to strike, but, on the other hand, the Government as an employer, should be above suspicion. Orders for rolling stock were now being sent oversea, and not only to Britain, but even to Germany. Referring to the dynamite outrages which the Minister had dealt with, the hon. member said that legislation should be introduced to punish those who were found unlawfully in the possession of dynamite. It had been said by the Minister that ashes had been found in the Johannesburg Trades Hall, as if in-criminating documents had been burnt; that might, or might not, have been the case&#x2014;there was no evidence; but there was a statement that official documents had Been burnt in Pretoria&#x2014;instructions with regard to the censorship, it had been stated&#x2014;and he hoped that the Minister would give them an explanation of the matter. The hon. member went on to Real with the alleged shooting of natives which the Minister had admitted in reply to a recent question, which he said was a very serious affair, and said that they should have some further information on these matters. In conclusion, the hon. member moved, as an amendment, to the amendment of the hon. member for Jeppe (Mr. Creswell): In line two, delete the words &#x201C;of citizens of this Union,&#x201D; and after the word &#x201C;trial&#x201D; in the same line insert the words &#x201C;or the unlawful shooting or assaulting, of citizens of this Union&#x201D;; and on page 142, in the last line but one of the amendment delete the word &#x201C;thirteen&#x201D; and insert &#x201C;eight,&#x201D; after January, and at the end of the amendment add the words &#x201C;and the unlawful shooting or assaulting, of citizens of the Union.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The amendment would then read as follows: &#x201C;To omit all the words after &#x201C;That,&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;This House declines to condone the deportation without trial, or the unlawful shooting or assaulting, of citizens of this Union, and is of opinion that before proceeding further with legislation indemnifying the Government or its servants for other illegal acts committed by them since January 8th, 1914, the fullest information should be before it as to those acts and the alleged justification for them. To this end it considers that a thorough and searching investigation should be conducted by a competent and impartial tribunal presided over by the Chief Justice of South Africa or other ordinary Judge of Appeal with power to provide for the representation before it, of the Trade Unions and other bodies against whom Martial Law was declared. It is further of opinion that to enable Martial Law to be at once withdrawn and to permit of Parliament acting upon the result of the abovementioned investigation a Bill should be introduced suspending any litigation against the Government or its servants in respect of all illegal acts committed subsequent to January 8th, 1914, other than the illegal deportation of citizens and the unlawful shooting or assaulting of citizens of the Union.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. W. SAMPSON</person> (Commissioner-street),</from>

<p>rising at 2.10 a.m. It was his duty to say a few words before the debate concluded. The constituency he represented had had to bear the brunt of all that had happened. On one day in July many people there had their heads broken. That night there were shots fired through the streets, and the next day volleys were fired on harmless citizens, which amounted to little less than butchery. Then there was that brilliant, noble and inspiring spectacle, the taking of the Trades Hall, which the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Madeley) had the other night very brilliantly described. He (Mr. Sampson) had seen the whole thing. It was something to commend the Defence Force for. He would suggest that the Minister of Defence should strike a medal by which they could remember the happening. (Labour laughter.) As far as his constituents were concerned, it would be for ever a laughing stock. Quoting from a report of one of his speeches, the only one, which, he said had not been quoted in the House so far, he pointed out that he had then said that he would rather have a general election than a general strike at any time. That had been his opinion all along, and that was the only way they could have avoided troubles through which they had passed.</p>

<p>He wanted to associate himself in the first place with everything his friends on the Labour benches had done. He did not want to be whitewashed. Had he been given the opportunity he would have done what they had done. All they had been doing was to try to get the workers to follow constitutional laws with a view to remedying their grievances. He said that many theories had been advanced during the debate, and he thought that the last speaker had got nearer the truth than any other member. Certainly the hon. member for Tembuland got very near it, but he did not work his own statements out to their logical conclusions, and if he had done so he would have got nearer the truth. His (the speaker&#x2019;s) theory was that the strike was egged on with a view to creating trouble, so that something might be made to happen in this country to drown the differences in that House. Mr. Sampson went on to say there was nothing in the labour movement with which he had been acquainted since its inception of which he or anyone else need feel ashamed. He thought not very long after the happenings in July that in the minds of more than one Minister this idea of deportation occurred. He thought it was one of the things decided upon a long time ago, and that after events were really created to bring about that end. The plan seemed <span class="col_679-680" refersTo="page_0346"/>to be not only to overthrow the working-class movement in this country, but with the idea of getting level with political enemies, including some hon. members who sat opposite. He would like to know from the Minister whether he did not make preparations in July for calling out the Defence Force, and referred to a visit to Pretoria, where he saw maps of the Wit-watersrand area headed &#x201C;Industrial Dispute, July, 1913,&#x201D; and an unusual number of officers about the Government Buildings. Then curiously enough the papers for some months past had contained paragraphs to the effect that the idea was prevalent that certain men would have to be deported. It became a by-word in Johannesburg. &#x201C;You are going to be deported.&#x201D; In December the &#x201C;Star&#x201D; had a programme of what was going on and the strange thing was that these things did actually happen in January. He put it to the Government that they were humiliated after the Carlton Hotel affair, and afterwards acted in a spirit of revenge. He also wanted to know from the Minister whether he had any assistants inside the Federation of Trades egging on the proposed second strike in July. Everything seemed to point to that being the case. These men did not make speeches much outside, but got at the men inside. With regard to the proposed second strike in July, the speaker said that the Ministry were baulked by the politicians, his colleagues on those benches, who succeeded in stopping it, and preventing the Government from carrying out then what they did in January.</p>

<p>The trouble did not begin in July last, but dated back a good many years before there was a working-class political movement in South Africa. It was the failure of the Trade Unions to get redress for their grievances which brought the Labour Party into existence. In the late Transvaal Parliament no heed was given to the representations made by the Labour members. Although it was the custom to pass one industrial measure per session, at the same time no attention was paid to miners&#x2019; phthisis and the bigger evils. Blacklisting and the cheating of men by means of wrong measurement was rampant. Another mistake had been made in the Transvaal with regard to the passing of the Industrial Disputes Act. The Government attempted the impossible. This Act took away from the men the right to lay down their tools, and it gave them no equivalent and no proper method of redressing their grievances. That law was in the main at the bottom of this trouble, and the only offences which some of the deportees had committed were breaches of this repressive law.</p>

<p>Continuing, the hon. member said that the country would have been spared anything like the occurrences of the last eight months had it not been for the high-handed action of the mining officials at Benoni. Had the Government not assisted these companies early in the fight by bringing scabs into the mine we might have been spared many of the incidents that had occurred. Government was not prepared to show the sympathy to the men that it should have done but it was very quick to assist the mining companies. (Labour cheers.) Why did the Minister side with the mining companies&#x003F; A number of the men who had been deported were arrested then for causing a strike which the Minister of Mines said was no strike at all in the meaning of the Act.</p>

<p>You cannot disconnect the two incidents. They were all part of the same strike. The hon. member went on to say that the warnings uttered from the cross-benches last session&#x2014;now stated to have been used as threats&#x2014;were given in all good faith with the desire to assist the country and the Government, and prevent a general strike. Continuing, the hon. member said the Government had precipitated the strike on July 4th. While the ballot was being taken to decide whether a general strike should be declared on July 10th or not, the Government were bringing troops on the Rand and bringing soldiers by train, and were making all sorts of arrangements which seemed like the preliminaries of battle. He said that there would have been no strike at all had the Government not precipitated it by leading the workers to believe that they were going to try to crush them. The hon. member said he had seen several large meetings in London, where he was born, but he had never seen such wanton acts of violence by policemen and troops as he had seen performed on Market-square, the police riding like savages with pick-handles, and taking an absolute delight in hitting every head they could see.</p>

<heading>CROWD BECOMES ANGRY.</heading>

<p>A large number of people who had taken no part in the strike up till then, and had simply come to see what was going to happen, as the previous speaker (Mr. Meyler) had pointed out. They took no part in any violence; but after the unwarrantable attack of the troops and police the crowd grew more and more angry, and there was a pretty lot of angry men in Johannesburg when night fell. Dealing with the burning of the &#x201C;Star&#x201D; office, he said it was the articles which had appeared in that paper which had caused the hatred of the people, of Johannesburg, and it was the most natural thing for the people of Johannesburg to attempt to burn the building down. History was but repeating itself. When he had been employed at a newspaper office at Cape Town in 1896 an attempt had also been made to roast them alive there, as a result of a <span class="col_681-682" refersTo="page_0347"/>violent speech on Greenmarket-square of a certain gentleman who was the friend of the Opposition. The crowd who went to the railway station went there to stop the trains which were bringing more troops and police.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newlands had talked about the burning of the &#x201C;Star&#x201D; office and the fact that 20 girls were there, but he forgot to make any remark about the girls being made to work at that late hour of the night. In his opinion this was more immoral than even the burning of the office. But all they heard about was the destruction of property&#x2014;nothing about the destruction of human life by intolerable conditions of work. Dealing with the statements about the hooligans, the hon. member declared that they were the result of the 1907 strike, when the mine-owners brought in men from the country, promising them &#x00A3;1 per day. After they were worked out the mine-owners threw them on the street. They drifted to the poorer quarters, and it was only natural that when they saw the way their fellow-workers from the mines were being treated on July 4th, that they should come along and assist those against whom force was being directed. Dealing with the shooting in the streets of Johannesburg on the 5th July, he said he believed that the soldiers indulged in indiscriminate shooting. He would like to know from the Minister the instructions that were issued. He quoted from the King&#x2019;s Regulations directing that soldiers should not shoot on persons separated from the crowd, and said this is exactly what happened. For soldiers to lie down in the street and shoot inoffensive persons was nothing less than butchery. Dealing with the Carlton Hotel conference, be said that the men who signed the treaty were the next day ridiculed all along the Reef.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#a_great_disappointment">

<heading>A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.</heading>

<p>He had an idea on the Sunday that there would be trouble, for he heard crowds of men denouncing their leaders for signing an agreement to compensate blacklegs, and hands were held up against resolutions advising the men to go back to work. There was no return to work until those men who had been shot down in the streets had been buried; but instead, an orderly procession of some 30,000 workmen who attended their comrades&#x2019; funerals. Then there was an interval. The men asked that matters which had been urged for many years should be attended to. Delegates proceeded to Pretoria to discuss their grievances with the Government. The men had been told by the delegates who were at the Carlton Hotel that the Government had given them to understand that the mine owners had placed themselves unreservedly in the hands of the Government. The delegates went to Pretoria, not to speak in a truculent manner, but in a fair way, and were solicitous to do the workers some good. They were greatly disappointed, however, when the Prime Minister told them that he could not decide anything definitely in regard to employees Other than: those employed on the railways at that conference. It appeared to the men representing the general trades that Government was making an attempt to divide the workers and to reduce the railway men to dissociate themselves from the general trades.</p>

<p>Mr. Sampson denied that the Federation&#x2019;s letter to the Government of July 17 last was in the nature of an ultimatum, and maintained it was only natural that the men should ask for a reply to be given by a certain date in order that they might be able to discuss it on a date when it was convenient to hold a meeting. The letter was never intended to be an ultimatum. The Government told the delegates they would appoint a commission to inquire into their chief grievances. From the very beginning he knew that that would not wash with the workmen on the Rand; but, worse than that, when they were asked, the Government would not agree to abide by the decisions of the commission. The workmen could only be excused if they thought the Government were fooling them and were trying to gain time in order to put them off, while they were making preparations to beat them in other ways. That was what the workmen thought. Then they came to the suspense caused by the threat of a second strike. Inflamed and excited by the scant courtesy the delegates had received at Pretoria, some of the more excited men said it was not then too late, and that they should strike again. He was glad to say that strike never took place.</p>

<p>Continuing the hon. member said that he could not pass over his little contribution to that debate without referring to what the Minister had called &#x201C;the great conspiracy.&#x201D; The Minister had taken newspaper cuttings and pieced them up and interspersed them with his own remarks, so that they had not known what was newspaper cutting or what was the Minister&#x2019;s own statement, and wherever an incident had happened between July and January it had to be made to fit in, irrespective of the date of the incident. It showed scant respect to that House when the Minister came to it with a tale like that.</p>

<p>Proceeding, the hon. member read the following affidavits from Mr. J. Erasmus, a reporter on the &#x201C;Rand Daily Mail&#x201D;; Mr. Hindman a member of the Executive of the Transvaal Association; and Mr. T. A. Tole, one of the organisers of the Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association, to show that there was no connecting link between the railway strike, the coal strike, and the strike of Unions affiliated to the Federation:</p>

<block name="quote">I, JOHN ERASMUS, make oath and say: I am a reporter on the staff of the &#x201C;Rand Daily Mail.&#x201D; I was with Mr. J. T. Bain, Mr. J. Hindman, and others at the Trades Hall, Johannesburg, on <span class="col_683-684" refersTo="page_0348"/>the morning of Wednesday, January 7, 1913. Mr. Bain and Mr. Hindman have been personal friends of mine for many years. My business as a reporter was to obtain a statement of the attitude of the Trades Hall leaders on the strike position as disclosed in the Press that morning. I found Mr. Hindman telephoning to Mr. Poutsma, insisting on his coming to Johannesburg immediately to explain the position with regard to the railway strike. It was clear from Mr. Hindman&#x2019;s remarks that neither he, as acting secretary of the Miners&#x2019; Association, nor Mr. Bain as secretary of the Federation of Trades, had even been consulted about the strike of the railwaymen. It was understood from this telephonic communication that Mr. Poutsma would arrive in Johannesburg shortly after one o&#x2019;clock that day. I next saw Mr. Bain, and he was extremely annoyed at the announcement that Mr. Poutsma would be expecting him at that hour. He said that he had never been consulted, nor had anyone else at the Trades Hall been consulted, with regard to the railway strike. He was angry at receiving the news for the first time through the newspapers. I was anxious to be present, in the interests of my profession, when Mr. Poutsma arrived; but Mr. Bain said, with some heat, that Poutsma had never on any occasion consulted him about his movements, and he would not miss his lunch for the convenience of Mr. Poutsma. The time of the arrival had been a misunderstanding. I subsequently met Mr. Poutsma on his arrival by the train at Park Station before three o&#x2019;clock. There was no representative of the Trades Hall to meet him. I accompanied him to the Trades Hall, and was present at the meeting with Messrs. Hindman and Bain and others, when Mr. Poutsma made his statement as to the circumstances leading up to the railway strike. Mr. Poutsma commenced with an apology for never having consulted the Miners&#x2019; Association or the Federation of Trades, or any of the other Rand Trade Unions. On this point both Mr. Bain and Mr. Hindman &#x2014;Mr. Bain especially so&#x2014;were indignant, pointing out the serious consequences which might arise from his Society having acted independently without consulting other interested bodies of workers. Mr. Poutsma explained that the Amalgamated Society of Railway and Harbour Servants had been forced to declare the strike by the non possumus attitude adopted by the Ministers and the Administration. The fact was, he said, that he had never dreamt that they were going to be forced into this position on a matter which could have been settled quite easily. This position had arisen so suddenly and unexpectedly that he had had no opportunity of consulting other representatives of organised labour. I was requested not to report the foregoing, and I was allowed to remain on the understanding that I would comply with that request.</block>

If the Association had been a party to any such conspiracy for a general strike, as has been suggested, I must have known of it. I knew nothing of it. On 7th January I telephoned to Mr. Poutsma, at Pretoria, asking him to come over and give my executive the facts of the railway position, as all we knew about it was what we saw in the newspapers, which might be unreliable. He came over, and Mr. J. T. Bain and I saw him. We told him that our Association, for one, could not be rushed into a national movement in five minutes, and he said he did not want it to be. I telegraphed to Mathews and Toomey to return, as the situation was threatening. During that week the executive of the Association met and decided against getting involved in the railway strike, subject to what the Federation might say; and at the Federation meeting on 10th January the miners&#x2019; delegates voted against striking. Previously to that the Association had never conferred with either the railway men or the Federation regarding a general strike. The Syndicalist conspiracy story is pure rubbish and fiddlesticks.</block>

<p>P. WHITESIDE, Justice of the Peace.</p>

<block name="quote">I, THOMAS ALEXANDER TOLE, make oath and say: I am one of the organisers of the Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association, and vice-president of the Transvaal Federation of Trades. Towards the end of 1913 I was sent by the Executive of the Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association to organise the miners of the Natal coal mines, in response to a request for such organisation from the Natal men. I had nearly finished my work there accordingly, when trouble broke out between the engine-drivers on those mines and their employers. This trouble, I know, was spontaneous on the part of these engine drivers, and was in no way engineered from Johannesburg. The engine-drivers, however, asked the <span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0349"/>Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association to stand by them in their trouble if necessary, and the Association agreed. However, it never became necessary, as the engine-drivers got what they wanted. Two weeks later I returned to the Rand, having completed my work in Natal. Three days after that, the Miners&#x2019; Association at Johannesburg heard that its officials on the coal mines had been dismissed because of their being such officials. I was sent back to investigate, and reported the facts to be as stated, and that the Natal men were determined to strike unless the men were reinstated and certain other demands complied with. I saw the mine-owners, who refused to reinstate the dismissed men, and notice to cease work was handed in by the men. Mr. Tom Mathews, the general secretary of the Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association, came down to try and settle the dispute, but failed, and returned to Johannesburg. Then I again opened negotiations, but without success, and the men came out. Then Mathews came down again to try to settle the trouble, with Toomey, the president of the Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association. They succeeded in getting the owners to agree to terms acceptable to the men except as regards the question of wages, which they reserved for the men&#x2019;s views. They recommended the men to accept the wage offered by the employers, and so did I. The men, however, refused. Toomey and Mathews had been sent specially, over my head, by the executive of the Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association to settle the dispute, as the feeling of the executive was that the Natal men should be satisfied with the terms obtainable for the time being. It was the men themselves who insisted on rejecting them. Finding that they could do no more, Toomey and Mathews returned to Johannesburg, their return being accelerated by a telegram received by them from the head office that a grave situation had arisen on the railways, and that their presence was necessary. I remained in Natal, and noticed that before and during the Natal strike the Government acted on behalf of the coal mine-owners, and assisted them in preventing a settlement by allowing them to break the mining regulations ad libitum, and also by sending armed police to drive the natives underground&#x2014;for instance, at Glencoe&#x2014;the result being that the boys worked without proper supervision, and the Glencoe mine is now on fire in three sections. As for McKerrell, he was authorised by the Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association to assist me, before the strike, in my organising work in Natal, and that was all. Then he went to Durban and informed some of the coal owners that the men would not agree to this or that, and when he spoke to Mr. Warington Smythe he was doing so merely as an individual on his own responsibility. In&#x003F; any case I understand his threats to have been made after failure of all the negotiations only, and in general conversation, and no one on the men&#x2019;s side took any particular notice of what he said as binding anyone except himself. Certainly he had no ground for believing that his threats might come true. The whole conspiracy story is an absolute lie. I may add that organisers of the T.M.A. were sent to Witbank to prevent the men there from sticking in sympathy with Natal without the authority of the Executive of the T.M.A.</block>

<block name="quote">I, THOMAS MATHEWS, make oath and say: I have read the affidavit of T. A. Tole, sworn to-day, regarding the Natal coal strike. I confirm the contents thereof. It is possible that the engine-drivers were encouraged to press their demands by the fact of the Indians&#x2019; strike having somewhat embarrassed the coal owners and Government. With the Indian strike the Transvaal Miners&#x2019; Association, of which I am general secretary, and the Transvaal Federation of Trades, of which I am an executive member, have nothing whatever to do. The request to my association to support the engine-drivers came from the local branch of the miners. Tole&#x2019;s efforts resulted in 90 per cent. of the Natal miners becoming members of the association. When Toomey and I returned to Johannesburg we found a railway strike declared. The thing came as a thunderbolt to me. I was completely taken by surprise by it; I knew nothing whatever about it before, and was surprised that I had not been consulted either in the T.M.A. or in the Federation. I know that neither body was in the least concerned with planning it. As for the general strike, it was only thought of after the railway strike began.</block>

<p>Oh, no, you were not so friendly. (Laughter.) Continuing, he said that the only charge against Mr. Bain seemed to be that he had been a member of the Transvaal Secret Service. He was told that the Minister was a member of the Transvaal Secret Service at one time. When did such service become dishonourable&#x003F; Dealing with the statement credited to Mason: &#x201C;That there is no pond deep enough to drown him, nor is there any rope long enough to hang him,&#x201D; the speaker said that under cross-examination the reporters and others admitted that this might not be a correct quotation of what Mason said. One witness had stated that he had taken it down on a cuff and made a mark against &#x201C;him.&#x201D; Even the police officer was not sure. What Mr. Mason had said was: &#x201C;There is no pond too deep in which to drown himself, and no rope too long to hang himself with,&#x201D; describing the feelings that a blackleg should have. The reporters admitted that that was what might have been said and at the adjourned hearing the charge was withdrawn. He protested against the things which had been brought up without proper explanations. Referring to the report of the speeches alleged to have been made by the deported men, the speaker said that on many occasions the men deported had complained that they had been misreported. The statement credited to Waterston had been corrected at subsequent meetings by himself, but these contradictions never appeared in the Press the next morning. Ministers were the first to complain if they were misrepresented. He went on to say that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Railways had led them to believe that the Government&#x2019;s desire was to avoid trouble while the men were against conciliation and wanted a general strike. He read a telegram from a Mr. Sutherland, Mayor of Volksrust, showing the men there desired conciliation. The Minister of Railways had stated that the deported men were putting their heads together in February last for the purpose of inducing other Societies to declare a general strike. But his only proof of that statement was a selected quotation from a letter which he said was written by Mr. Poutsma during the week ended August 2. The letter was dated July 23, as a matter of fact, but the Minister was anxious to disconnect it altogether from the July incident. After reading the entire letter, he said it was clear that it was not necessary that its writer should be a member of a junta to know that there was likely to be a general strike, under certain circumstances. The Minister implied that there was some connection between the general trades and the railway men at that date, but there was absolutely no connection, as the letter showed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SAMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I was mainly employed on piece-work, and earned every penny I got. Continuing, he said that what was attempted by retrenchment was to reduce wages and create in South Africa what hon. members on the Opposition benches had threatened&#x2014;a reservoir of unemployed&#x2014;(Labour cheers)&#x2014;a body of men they could draw on who might be forced by hunger to take work from others at a lower wage. His opinion was that the employers provoked that strike to create a situation of putting many men on the streets, so that at their own time they could re-engage these men at their own rate of wages. There had been no Syndicalist conspiracy, but there had been a conspiracy on the part of the Government and the big employers to reduce wages. He was told by Mr. Mathews that the books of the Miners&#x2019; Association were still in the hands of the authorities, and he asked what good purpose was served by doing that unless it was a purpose which was not favourable to the men. He was informed that the membership roll of the T.M.A. <span class="col_689-690" refersTo="page_0351"/>had been copied, and that some mine managers had been put in possession of the list of these men and refused them employment. He hoped that this information was wrong, but he could see no other way in which that information could have been obtained. The hon. member went on to say there was no necessity for Martial Law, except as part of the plan to deport men. When they talked about blowing up the mines, surely those who said these things ought to blush for making the statement. Surely the men would like to leave the door open to their future employment. If Martial Law was unnecessary, why should hon. members be asked to condone what had taken place under Martial Law &#x003F; The hon. member for Fort Beaufort spoke about the large percentage of Trade Union funds going to administrative expenses. He (Mr. Sampson) could say that in his own union during the past 18 years not five per cent. of the total revenue had gone in management expenses. He condemned the high mighty police officials for having robbed men of their trade union cards, which had been torn un. It was that Card which was a means of identity in the matter of benefits.</p>

<heading>&#x201C;IN THE GOOD CAUSE.&#x201D;</heading>

<p>Dealing with the raid on the Old Arcade, the hon. member referred to the way in which he alleged people were treated. He drew attention to what had been done by one constable, who had roughly treated ladies and gentlemen and had used insulting language. Complaints had been lodged, he had brought the matter to the notice of the House, but nothing had been done so far. These were the things people put up with, according to the hon. member for Langlaagte, &#x201C;in a good cause.&#x201D; He thought that the Minister prevented the termination of the strike in January, and described how Trade Unionists, who could not go back to work unless they held a meeting, were chased from one point to another, with the result that, owing to the regulations issued by the Minister, the strike was continued several days longer. Even appeals to the Minister and the Control Officer for permits to hold meetings proved unavailing. Some tried to hold a meeting behind mine dumps and were chased away; others started a cricket match, but were equally unsuccessful. Having referred to a letter which appeared in the &#x201C;Cape Times,&#x201D; wherein a Mr. Chester asked whether Government was going to compensate innocent victims of Martial Law, the speaker dealt with the accusations made against the Federation, declaring that that organisation did not give the order to cut off Johannesburg&#x2019;s water, light, etc., in July. That happened as a result of what happened on Market Square on the 4th of July. The men came out, but one of the leaders now deported sent them back almost immediately, aided by a letter from the men&#x2019;s union. Then they on the cross-benches had been credited with trying to bring out the natives. Never a bigger untruth had been told. He said that these statements were absolutely wrong. Was there a word in the Commission&#x2019;s report to the effect that hon. members on the cross-benches had been trying to get the natives to rise&#x003F; The story that they had tried to do anything of the sort was a mere bogey. If there had been any sign of such a thing he believed the men on strike would have banded themselves together for protection of life and property. They knew that men of Trade Unions had offered their services to guard the town. When that was stated the other day, the Minister laughed; but he could assure hon. members that these men meant business, and were not out to deceive the Government. They sometimes Had property to defend as well as other people.</p>

<p>said the Prime Minister had indulged in a number of catch phrases, giving no justification for what the Government had done. He did not produce any evidence to the House. If all the evidence the Prime Minister had brought forward comprised the whole of the evidence the Government had to go on in declaring Martial Law, then it was a-very flimsy case indeed, and it would prove to the people that Government had tried to assist the big employers to crush out the Labour movement. (Labour cheers.)</p>

<p>Just before 5 o&#x2019;clock, Mr. Sampson proceeded to say that tyranny of the kind that had been witnessed on the Rand from July onwards could only breed revolution. If there was a revolution, Ministers should not be surprised, for they would have brought it about. They had not considered the people in the least. There was no better breeding ground for revolution than the way in which tyrants tried to tread the people underfoot. After all the men who had been deported were doing no more than trying to get a better life&#x2014;(Labour cheers)&#x2014;something better for the workers. There had been no plot or revolution in South Africa. The Minister had tried to evolve a common or garden strike, such as occurred every week in other countries, into a revolution. (Labour cheers.) If he <span class="col_691-692" refersTo="page_0352"/>had been dealing with what had happened as an ordinary strike he would not have been able to carry out his plan to crush the Trade Unions. It was only by instituting Martial law that he could achieve that end, but he failed, and he never could accomplish his end. (Labour cheers.)</p>

<p>He (Mr. Sampson) had stated at the beginning of his speech that there were others than the Government who knew of their plans,; and he quoted an article from the &#x201C;Star&#x201D; of January 6 regarding the preparations of the Government to deal with labour troubles, the contents of which he said bore a striking similarity to what had since happened. How would this treatment of Trade Unionists affect immigration &#x003F; The hon. member questioned whether members of Trade Unions in other countries would venture to come to South Africa, if that was the way the Government treated their fellow Trade Unionists. In regard to what the Minister had said about the ballot which had been taken by the Federation, he (Mr. Sampson) had been present at the trades Hall. He had gone to see that everything was fair and square. The returns had been on the table, and he had taken a check of them himself; and he said that the Minister was not justified in reflecting on the character of the men who counted the ballot. The majority was, as stated three to one in favour of a strike, so high had the feeling of the men grown in regard to the Government&#x2019;s treatment of the railwayman. These men in other trades had nothing to gain from striking, but had stood by the railwayman. Unless they could show what the whole of the workmen would have gained by striking, where did the conspiracy come in&#x003F; If the men conspired, they must have done so for some mutual gain, and there had been nothing of that kind proved. He whole-heartedly supported the amendment of the hon. member for Jeppe; but he had seconded the amendment of the hon. member for Weenen, and would like to give his reasons for doing so: he therefore moved the adjournment of the debate at that stage.</p>

He asked why those hon. members who spoke against the deportations did not assist the Labour Party in its appeal when the ship was within hailing distance. They asked for a little consideration. He did not see the need for urgency in connection with this Bill. He thought that as a result of what had happened the Government would be a little better disposed to its employees than it had been in the past. He thought that the Railway Department, instead of teaching the men a lesson had learnt a lesson themselves. He asked hon. members to do justice to those who were poor. He had listened to debates on all sorts of subjects, and why should hon. members laugh when members on the cross-benches brought forward different matters. He thought he would be lacking in his duty if he did not vote for the last amendment. Those who said that they stood for justice must know that by voting for the second reading they would not be doing justice. In conclusion, Mr. Sampson said: &#x201C;We shall not deny the Government indemnity for acts committed in good faith, but we shall aim at making it impossible for the Government ever to perpetrate another such outrage on the people of South Africa.

<heading>GENERAL SMUTS&#x2019; REPLY.</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>,</from>

<p>rising at 5.40 a.m., said the debate had lasted so long and they had reached such an hour that he did not think it was expected of him to make any lengthy speech. Before he replied to some of the criticisms he would like to refer to a point raised by the hon. member for Jeppe (Mr. Creswell) and also referred to by the hon. members-for Weenen and George Town. The hon. member for Jeppe (Mr. Creswell) last Friday stated that he had information that <span class="col_695-696" refersTo="page_0354"/>on Sunday evening or Monday morning last a telegram was despatched from the Defence Department here to the Defence Department of Pretoria instructing the Department to destroy by fire all censorship regulations and forward a certificate stating that that had been done Then the hon. member stated that on the same day the wire was sent a reply was received stating that certain censorship instructions had been destroyed by fire. The hon. member said an attempt was made to destroy certain evidence which was material to an enquiry to be made under his amendment.</p>

<p>Continuing, General Smuts said: &#x201C;Last Monday I sent the following wire to Pretoria: &#x2018;Destroy by fire copy number so-and-so regulations of censorship and forward me certificate that this has been done.&#x2019; I got the following answer from Pretoria: &#x201C;&#x2018;Copy number so-and-so was destroyed in our presence this, 16th of February) 1914.&#x2019; It is perfectly clear that the telegrams to which the hon. member refers are identically the telegrams, I sent to Pretoria. These telegrams did not refer to any matter having reference to the present debate. As Minister of Defence I have in pay possession certain secret instructions belonging to the War Office to use in, an emergency of world-wide importance, which might arise under certain contingencies. These documents I hold on the instructions of the British Government and I have to destroy them as new instructions are issued That was what happened. New instructions have been sent and the old ones have been destroyed. The important point is this: That this matter, which is of very great importance and is an official secret of the War Office, was disclosed immediately after the wires had been sent by me, to the hon. member for Jeppe by some spy or thief who got hold of this telegram. (Ministerial cheers.) I shall insist, and this Government are entitled to insist, that we shall have the name of that thief or spy from the hon. member for Jeppe, and if the hon. member does not state the name of that individual, I shall use the machinery of this House in order to get it. (Ministerial cheers.) This matter has absolutely nothing to do with the subject with which we are now dealing, but it had to do with an entirely different matter, and these censorship regulations were never once used on the present occasion.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#his_case_strengthened">

<heading>HIS CASE STRENGTHENED.</heading>

<p>Continuing, General Smuts said he wished to say a very few words in reply to points raised in the present debate. He thought he might make bold to say that the case put forward in his opening statement had not been shattered in any material respect. On the contrary, that case had been strengthened in very material respects by evidence brought forward on both sides of the House. Some criticisms, almost quibbling criticisms, had been advanced against the use of the word &#x201C;conspiracy,&#x201D; but it was not a question of words&#x2014;they had to do with facts and there was no doubt that from all the information Government had had to do with a combined movement for a criminal object. (Ministerial cheers.) The statement he had made had not been shaken in any material particular by the discussion in the House. Some hon. members who had differed from his statement of the case had brought forward a stronger case. The hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. Merriman) had brought forward a stronger indictment, stating that these people were declared enemies of society. He (General Smuts) did not go to that length. Then the hon. member for Cape Town, Harbour, asserted that these people were waging war against society&#x2014;(hear, hear)&#x2014;and were resorting to all those methods of barbarism which were declared illegal by the Geneva Convention.] He (General Smuts) could not possibly have made a stronger statement than those made by some of his critics.</p>

<p>What was the case put forward on the other side&#x003F; The hon. member for Jeppe had made this case: that the Government had tried to prevent the workers combining to strike, and that, in order to rehabilitate itself, it had resorted to a diabolical plot to work up the workers to a revolution, so that it might use the military forces against them. He asked hon. members if a single title of evidence had been brought forward to support that view&#x003F; The hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Hull) had said, Well, we have to do with a case of jackasses. This is a body of fools who talked over a number of grievances, until they were filled with them, but they had not a criminal motive.&#x201D; That view seemed to be sun-ported by the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Fichardt), but he did not think there was anything to support that view either, and it was perfectly clear, with the evidence before them and from the actual occurrences, that these, views of the hon. member for Jeppe and the hon. member for Barberton were not supported, either by the actual facts, or by the extracts which he had read, and which were mostly from the &#x201C;Rand Daily Mail,&#x201D; a paper favourable to these men. What practically all were agreed on was that the Government had not misjudged the position in January, and that the Government had been entirely justified in calling out the Defence Force in January, and had not misjudged the danger which faced the country. That was most important, because once they had reached the conclusion that the Government was justified in declaring Martial Law and calling out such an armed force as had been done, important consequences followed. If in ordinary, circumstances, in ordinary times, any Government in that country were to deal with people, as they had dealt with these nine deportees, the conduct of that Government would be most reprehensible. He referred to what the hon. member for Fordsburg had said.</p>

<from><span class="col_697-698" refersTo="page_0355"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. DUNCAN</person> (Fordsburg)</from>

<p>said that he agreed that the circumstances were absolutely everything.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person></from>

<p>said it was absolutely necessary that they should start from the point of view that such things having happened in the country, which made Martial Law necessary, and that, when the situation arose, the Government were entitled to take such measures as they thought fit in such a crisis. These were not ordinary times, but the gravest crisis possible in the fortunes of the country. The hon. member for Cape Town, Central (Mr. Jagger) was entirely wrong when he confused the case with lynch law. It was not a case at all of lynch law. The hon. member for Fordsburg and other hon. members had pointed out that the case he (General Smuts) had made in his opening statement was not so strong as in the preamble. But the preamble of that Bill started with the fundamental facts of Martial Law. The whole case of the preamble resting, as he had rested it in his opening statement, on the basis of a very grave crisis having arisen in that country justified the Government in declaring Martial Law and calling out armed forces in that country. Almost every member had said that in his statement he had said they must not wait for passion to cool down, but he had not referred to passion at all in his statement (which he read again), but said that the deportations were part and parcel of the events which had been occurring. As to what the hon. member for Cape Town, Central, had said, the ordinary law courts could hardly have dealt with those cases, and he thought that a special court should have been created. Suppose that had been done, they would have got no further. It was not only a case of a special court, but there was no legal serious offence with which they could have charged these people. They would have had to create a special crime, and besides creating a special tribunal and a special crime, they would have had to create a special punishment also. He asked hon. members whether that was a feasible proceeding. Was it feasible to have those nine men in prison, constitute a court to try them, create a crime with which to charge them, and then lay down some extraordinary punishment&#x003F; He was sure that no Parliament in its sound senses would have adopted a course like that. The responsibility rested on the Government, who had had to take the best steps they could for the interests of the country. All that they asked that House of Parliament was to approve the action the Government had taken, and that approval was necessary in the state of the law. One question which remained was this. These men, having been deported, should they come Pack&#x003F; Were they to stultify the action which had been taken by the Government and allow these people to come back&#x003F; He did not think there were many hon. members in that House, whatever the initial view they might have taken of the deportation, who would say that it was desirable that these people should come back. If any trouble were to recur in that country&#x2014;and they were by no means out of the wood&#x2014;and a similar crisis were to occur in the immediate or near future, what was going to happen&#x003F; They had no standing army in that country, and if their Citizen Army saw that they were playing with such risks, did they think that they would get their citizens to respond as they had responded&#x003F; (Hear, hear.)</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, he did not wish to labour the point, there was no course open to the House but to confirm the action which the Government had taken and to leave the responsibility where it rested&#x2014; mainly on the Government. The Government had taken the action. The House would confirm what the Government had done, and if that was done the House would take the best course possible in the interests of the country. They had heard arguments on abstract points, but he did not think it was necessary to go into those points. They all reverenced ideals of liberty and law in this country, but, of course, they must recognise in the last resort the highest constitutional ideals rested on a basis of force. How long would liberty endure if the Poutsmas and the Bains were allowed to go on as they had clone&#x003F; If they wanted this young country to develop on sound lines in the future, to be a free community, to have its constitutional liberty guaranteed, then it must be based on force, and he said this was the only possible course to prevent danger to those ideals.</p>
