MINISTERS:

           Progress in implementing Investing in Culture Programme

443.  Mrs N D Mbombo (ANC) asked the Minister of Arts and Culture:
      (a) What progress has his department made in implementing the
      Investing in Culture Programme since it was launched, (b) which
      projects are funded by his department and (c) which provinces are
      implementing the programme successfully?                      NO2473E

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Madam Speaker, the answer is quite long
but I will do my best. The programme has since been established as a chief
directorate with a staff complement of 15, which includes nine provincial
co-ordinators to support the strategic planning, implementation and
monitoring and evaluation of supported projects.

The Department of Arts and Culture, in conjunction with the Media,
Advertising, Publishing, Packaging and Printing Sector Education Training
Authority - MAPPP Seta - has entered into a training partnership through a
signed memorandum of agreement to ensure that the supported projects
receive accredited training whilst in the short term they provide
employment in compliance with the government’s Expanded Public Works
Programme.

Accredited training in this sector has been achieved through this
partnership with MAPPP Seta on 14 learnerships and 16 skills programmes. To
ensure a scaled-up and smooth implementation of the training programme, the
provincial co-ordinators are already trained and qualified as both
assessors and moderators on craft production, craft enterprise and craft
operation management. Sixty project managers have also qualified as
assessors on craft production and 2 696 crafters have qualified on craft
production.

In recognition of the existing skills and in increasing and transforming
the training provider base, a further 149 master crafters were registered
on the project central database. They are qualified to render accredited
training and thus can be exited.

The programme is currently funding 281 projects nationwide, with 88 located
within the various Integrated Sustainable Rural Development and Urban
Renewal Programme nodal areas. The details of the programme follow.

In Gauteng we have a total of nine projects in one nodal point, which offer
employment opportunities to 156 women and 254 youth, and we participate in
32 EPWPs. The budget allocation is R14,6 million.

In Mpumalanga we have a total of 24 projects in three nodal areas, which
employ 395 women, 290 youth and 20 in the EPWP. The budget for that is R13
million.

In the Western Cape there are a total of 13 projects in one nodal point,
which employ 102 women and 101 youth, and the budget for that is R7,3
million.

In the Northern Cape we have a total of 23 projects in 12 nodal points that
employ 238 women, 312 youth and 14 in the EPWP. The budget allocation is
R11,7 million.

In Limpopo we have a total of 43 projects in five nodal points employing
847 women, 620 youth and 67 in EPWPs. The budget for that is R32,4 million.

In the Free State we have a total of 16 projects in three nodal points
employing 126 women, 105 youth, and 11 in the Public Works Department’s
projects, with a budget of R10,7  million.

In the Eastern Cape there are 68 projects in 39 nodal points employing 683
women, 490 youth and 105 in the Public Works Department’s programmes, with
a budget of R38,1 million.

In KwaZulu-Natal we have a total of 59 projects in 24 nodal points
employing 396 women, 351 youth ...

The SPEAKER: Order, hon Minister. I suggest that, perhaps, the rest of the
information can be given in writing.

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Yes, I would like to table it if possible
but I think it gives a fairly good idea of what we are doing. Thank you.

The list of supported projects is available on request.

The Investing in Culture programme focuses  on  the  economic  opportunities
for craft,  music,  heritage  and  cultural  tourism  sectors.  Through  the
meaningful  partnerships  established  nationally  and  internationally,  as
manifested in the exhibitions  attended,  products  developed  from  several
projects were able to enter the mainstream markets. Some  of  the  supported
projects have already generated 10% of the allocated project costs, both  in
revenue accrual and/or rand value of  recognition  of  excellence.  This  is
seen as a good lead towards sustainability beyond departmental funding.

As the department, through Investing in Culture, is committed  to  providing
market access to funded projects, the Rand Show, amongst other  exhibitions,
offers the projects a platform  to  trade  in  an  experiential  environment
allowing a wide range of consumers to interact with  the  products.  At  the
2007  Rand  Show,  56  projects  were  exhibited,  with  a  revenue  accrual
amounting to  R  152  443.00.  Revenue  accrued  through  sales  amounts  to
approximately R2 million  whilst  infrastructure  development  allocated  to
specific projects by the EU R3 million, licensing from EMI  R1  million  and
R50 000 came from the local municipality.
(c)   Through continuous monitoring and evaluation, as well  as  a  thorough
orientation  programme,  more  than  90%  of   projects   are   successfully
implemented with full co-operation from all provinces.

Nkskz N D MBOMBO: Ndiyabulela Mphathiswa ngenkcazelo yakho evakalayo, kodwa
ixhala lam lisekubeni le misebenzi ingaka iza kugcineka njani ukuze iqhube
ixesha elide, le nto kuthiwa yi-sustainability ngesilungu, ngamanye amazwi
ingabi yinto yanamhlanje eza kuphela ngomso. Kwakhona, ndifuna ukwazi ukuba
mangaphi amanye amasebe ancedisa ukudala amathuba emisebenzi.

UMPHATHISWA WEZENKCUBEKO NEZITHETHE: Ndingenjenje ukuphendula lo mbuzo,
sifumana inkxaso enkulu kwiSebe lezemiSebenzi nanjengokuba besele
ndichazile ukuba kukho i-MAPPP seta enika abantu izatifiketi. Ngoko ke
siyancedisana ke kakhulu kwelo cala nela sebe. Eyona nto ingamandla
nebalulekileyo kukuba sifumane imali size siyifake kula malinge ukuze abe
ziinkqubo ezimileyo neziqinileyo.

Sifuna ukuba abantu bangapheleli okanye bangajongi kuwo wodwa la malinge.
Sifuna ukuba umntu athi akuba eqeqeshiwe akwazi ukuhamba, azifunele
umsebenzi ngaphandle ukuze akwazi ukuvulela abanye izithuba. Ngalo ndlela
ke sicinga ukuba la malinge angathatha ixesha elide okanye agcineke.
Ndiyabulela. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs N D MBOMBO: Thank you, hon Minister, for the clarity you have just
given but what concerns me is how those jobs will be secured and whether
they will be sustainable. Those jobs should not be for a short period. I
would also like to know which other departments are teaming up to create
more job opportunities.

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: What I would like to say at this stage is
what I said earlier on, namely that the Department of Labour does assist a
lot in that the MAPPP Seta issues certificates and that collaboration is
quite helpful to my department. What is of paramount importance is to get
adequate funding to ensure the strengthening and sustainability of these
initiatives.

Our aim is to encourage self-reliance among the people themselves in that
when they are trained in a specific field of work, they must go and look
for employment that fits the training they have received. That will also
pave the way for new entrants to also benefit from these initiatives. In
that way we are certain that these efforts will last longer and be
sustainable. I thank you.]

Mev D VAN DER WALT: Speaker, Minister, op bladsy 62 van die verslag van die
Ouditeur-Generaal vir 2006-07 is daar natuurlik ’n hele lys met die
projekte wat op daardie datum beskikbaar was. U het nou nie tyd gehad om
die lys te voltooi nie, maar die Noordwes was nie op daardie lys nie en ’n
mens wonder of hulle dan geen projekte gehad het nie. U oorstemmende
departement in die Limpopo Provinsie gaan al geruime tyd gebuk onder
geweldig ernstige klagtes van korrupsie en ek sal graag daarvan wil weet.

Die program het ten doel om geleenthede te skep, juis in areas vir mense
waar hulle woon; om daar ook ’n inkomste te verdien. Met die probleme wat
ek geskets het, wil ek graag van u, as nasionale Minister, weet watter
beheer of planne van aksie u in plek het om hierdie projekte se
volhoudbaarheid en implementering te verseker regoor al hierdie nodale
areas waarvan u praat. Dankie.

Die MINISTER VAN KUNS EN KULTUUR: In die vorige verslag is daar miskien nie
verslag gedoen oor die Noordwes nie, maar ek kan vandag vir u vertel daar
is 26 projekte in die Noordwes, waar ons 147 vrouens en 97 jeugdiges oplei.
Die begroting daarvoor is R13 miljoen.

Oor die kwessie van korrupsie: as u kennis dra daaroor, sal ons baie
dankbaar wees as u dit vir ons kan blootlê sodat ons daardie probleme kan
ondersoek. Baie dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs D VAN DER WALT: Speaker, Minister, on page 62 of the report of the
Auditor-General for 2006-07, there is, of course, a whole list of projects
that were available on that date. You did not have the time to complete the
list, but the North West was not on that list and one wonders if they had
no projects. Your corresponding department in Limpopo has had tremendously
serious allegations of corruption levelled against it for some time now and
I would like to know about that.

The programme is meant to create opportunities for people precisely in
those areas where they live; so that they can earn a living. Regarding the
problems I have indicated, I would like to know from you, as national
Minister, what control or plans of action you have in place to ensure the
sustainability and implementation of these projects across all these nodal
areas you have spoken of. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: In the previous report there may not have
been any mention of the North West but I can tell you today that there are
26 projects in the North West, where we are training 147 women and 97
youths. The budget for this is R13 million.

Regarding the issue of corruption: If you know anything about it, we would
be very grateful if you could supply us with that information so that we
can investigate these problems. Thank you.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Minister, Turakina is the name of a farm just outside
George. It is an ancient Quena name and if we listen attentively, we can
hear the ``tourism’’ in the word ``Turakina’’. If we have a little
understanding of ancient cosmologically orientated religions, you will know
that the ancient ``tourism’’ of ``Turakina’’ was of a special kind. It was
related to pilgrimage.
In the same way I can link the ancient Quena word, ``mullai’’, with the
present ``mouille’’ as in Mouille Point. In this case, some understanding
of etymology will help. Minister, is there any possibility that your
department can assist with the opening up of this hidden knowledge which is
linked to my Quena heritage and which I believe can make an incredible
contribution to cultural tourism? I thank you.

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: This is a very interesting question and
interesting information. There is one minor problem that I would like to
avoid and that is to get entangled in religious matters. We all have our
own belief systems and if you go through the various belief systems, you
will find that they all contradict each other. Therefore, I like to avoid
them. Much as one might say that the belief system you are talking about is
an important part of South African heritage, so are many others, but I
would rather steer clear of those.

However, I am willing to listen, to receive information on the matter and
we can look into it. As far as I am concerned, it is far better to steer
clear of religion because it is potentially a very explosive matter.

 Interventions to improve Mathematics and Science education, with a view to
 participation in 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study
452.  Mr G G Boinamo (DA) asked the Minister of Education:

      (1)   In light of a statement by an official of her department (name
            furnished) that South Africa would almost definitely participate
            in the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science
            Study, Timss, after the department’s interventions to improve
            Mathematics and Science education have had an impact, what are
            these interventions;

         2) whether her department has developed its own tests to evaluate
            the success of these interventions; if not, why not; if so, what
            are (a) the relevant details and (b) outcomes of the tests;

         3) whether South Africa will participate in Timss in 2011; if not,
            why not; if so, what are the relevant details?

                       NO2899E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, may I say, firstly, that in terms
of the quotation ascribed to a staff member of my department, I can’t
believe that a member of my department would use a phrase such as “would
almost definitely”, which, in Setswana, means go eletsa, o lekile le o a
netefatsa, because it sounds very strange. However, the reply to the
question is as follows.
Firstly, the interventions that are targeted at improving Maths and Science
in schools include ensuring that disadvantaged schools have adequate
resources to enable them to lay a solid foundation in these critical
subjects, particularly in the earlier grades, through compensatory post
provisioning and school allocations.

Secondly, interventions include recruiting students with the potential to
take up teaching as a profession through the provision of full-cost,
service-linked bursaries and to supply those bursaries for the studying of
subjects in these critical skills domains for South Africa.

Thirdly, they also involve strengthening ongoing development and support to
our serving teachers and managers of schools to make all our school centres
those of excellent teaching and learning.

We have developed our own testing systems with respect to part two of the
question as well as methods to evaluate the success of our interventions.

Through the systemic evaluations that are conducted at Grades 3, 6 and 9,
we have been able to establish important baseline information that directs
our interventions to specific areas that need strengthening.

We are already piloting standardised common tests at Grades 10 and 11 to
ensure that the transition to the new senior certificate in 2008 is as
smooth as possible.

We realise that there are serious needs and we are working on these in
order to have a system of external verification for all our internal
evaluations, not only of learner performance, but also with regard to the
quality assurance evaluations of the personnel and systems that are
currently utilised in the education system.

It is difficult, with respect to the last part of the question, for me to
respond to the “would almost definitely”, as ascribed to my official. South
Africa might or might not participate in Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study in 2011. The decision to participate will be
taken by government and the Minister of Education at that time.

We, of course, do also participate in other regional assessments and
international studies such as the South Eastern and Eastern African
Consortium for Measuring Educational Quality and Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study.

We value Timss, but we believe that the time has now come for us to really
look carefully at streamlining our participation in international studies,
many of which do not actually add value in terms of our understanding of
the key challenges that confront us in the system of education and often
replicate the nature of questions and tests that are put before our
children.

So, I believe that it is important that we avoid unnecessary duplication of
testing and focus on building a robust system that responds to our national
needs and unique challenges while attacking the core problems that underlie
the underperformance that we do see in a great deal of our learning sector
in South Africa.

Mr G G BOINAMO: Minister, thank you for your answer. However, the
improvement in the teaching of Maths and Science does not depend on
evaluation only, but also, and most importantly, on the qualifications of
teachers. Furthermore, learning and teaching material must be in place.

My questions are as follows: Firstly, what programmes are in place in order
to intervene effectively and productively in terms of the improvement of
Mathematics and Science?

Secondly, how many Mathematics and Science educators are there and what are
their levels of qualification?

Thirdly, how many schools are equipped with Science laboratories? Lastly,
was the Minister, by withdrawing South Africa from participating in Timss
in 2007, admitting the fact that her department has failed South African
children? Thank you.
The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, there seems to be a great deal of
licence with follow-up questions because I actually recorded six. So I am
not sure how to deal with this and I hope you will allow me the time.

Firstly, and clearly, as I indicated, there is no way in which evaluations
can be seen as the sole means of driving improvements in performance; they
are apart of, and are often used for research purposes. However, you also
have to ensure that the form of evaluation you utilise actually serves to
assist you in informing and developing your system.

While having a whole lot of international tests to participate in might
look very good, and while it may be nice for the opposition to say South
Africa did badly, as Minister of Education, I have to say that I must put
in place interventions that will improve the system; that is my duty.

Therefore, the quality of teachers must be improved, hence my current
recruitment of any qualified teachers, willing and able to teach in
currently vacant Mathematics posts, be they South African or non-South
African. The advert is out there. If you know any teachers who are
qualified, we have the posts in which to place them. So, clearly the issue
of qualifications is being addressed.

Secondly, we are addressing our teacher development programmes as well
because the research we have done indicates that the problem is not just
qualifications but also the understanding of the content. You may have done
Maths up to third-year level but if you can’t quite understand theorems, or
your algebraic understanding is poor and you are, therefore, unable to
teach Grade 12 children, improving content – teacher development – is,
therefore, vitally important.

Regarding schools with Science laboratories, I ask you again, hon member,
to visit the website of the Education department and read the report of
Nims, the National Institute for Materials Science. It has the full details
as to the number of schools that do not have laboratories. From the
briefing made to the portfolio committee by my officials, you are aware
that the majority of schools, particularly those in black communities, do
not have laboratories and libraries.

This is part of the indictment we must recognise and what we are seeking to
do, as government, is to respond and provide those resources. So we do not
get the reports done merely to have them sit on our tables and make us look
nice and informed; we are seeking to attack the problem at its heart.

Finally, my department has also briefed the portfolio committee on the
Dinaledi schools programme – and I am aware that you were present there –
which is an expansion of an initiative begun in 2001.

And if you had followed that report, it would have indicated that we have
now got down to the detail of what we actually do to ensure, one, that
there are resources for teaching Mathematics and Science in the schools;
two, that we have a specific teacher development programme for everyone of
the teachers in the 468 Dinaledi schools; and three, that we advance with
my eventual strategy, which will, of course, be concluded by that Minister
in 2011, of ensuring that every secondary school in South Africa offers
Mathematics to a child, whatever school he or she might be located in.

That is what South Africa must offer the children of the future. It should
not be our system that chooses whether a child does Maths or not by
preventing schools from having Maths teachers.

So, my own purpose is certainly to improve where we offer the subjects now
and also to ensure that we expand by giving every child in our country, in
secondary school, the opportunity to do quality Mathematics. That is my
response, hon member, to the several questions you posed. I hope I have
addressed them.

I urge you to read the reports that the officials have put before the
portfolio committee which contain the kind of detail that you may be
seeking. By withdrawing from Timss, I do not believe that it was an
admission that we are not ready for the programme.

I came here freely, when this question was asked, in fact, some months ago,
and said that I did not believe that our country has done sufficiently well
in the education system for me to be assured that we would perform better
or benefit greatly from participating in Timss 2007.

I said, therefore, that we must work hard at the strategies we have put in
place to ensure that in four years’ time we are better, more confident that
participating in Timss would actually be a sign that we have made some
improvement towards our country’s children performing better. I think it
takes courage to say that we are not quite ready yet. Let us prepare
ourselves better and be sure that when we do the test, we can show that we
are capable. [Applause.]

   Progress in reviewing social security and welfare services for children

  479. Mr T M Masutha (ANC) asked the Minister of Social Development:

       What is his department’s progress in reviewing the basket of social
       security and welfare services for children between the ages of 14
       and 18 years old?                                      NO2928E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, the department
has made the following progress since Cabinet directed the Forum of South
African Directors-General, Fosad, which is the social sector cluster, to
investigate measures to reduce vulnerability amongst children over the age
of 14 and to recommend a definition of child vulnerability.

Interdepartmental discussions were held on both a bilateral and a
multilateral basis, focusing on identifying gaps in the existing policies
and legislation with a view to designing interventions to respond to the
needs of vulnerable children in an integrated and comprehensive manner. A
matrix was developed to facilitate the identification of gaps pertaining to
service delivery for children between the ages of 14 and 18.

Furthermore, in May 2007, the Minister of Social Development hosted an
international symposium involving participants from various social sector
departments, social partners, as well as national and international
experts, to review existing child poverty reduction strategies and
interventions and to enhance existing plans towards reducing child poverty.

In September 2007 the department prepared a Cabinet memorandum defining
child vulnerability, identifying key elements that contribute to
vulnerability in children aged 14 to 18 years and recommending the
development of an integrated strategy to address their vulnerability.

On 5 September Cabinet indicated that further consultation was required to
refine the definition of child vulnerability and the development of the
proposed strategy. The department intends to conduct such consultations and
revise the initial Cabinet memo before the end of December 2007. It is, in
fact, work in progress. Thank you.

Mr T M MASUTHA: Thank you, Deputy Minister, for that very informative
response. The Minister of Social Development is known to have shifted the
frontiers of poverty facing children. When he took over in 1999, he found
only 500 000 beneficiaries of the child support grant, but today there are
8 000 000 on the system. Only children under the age of six were receiving
grants but now it is also accessed by children under the age of 14 and, of
course, the foster care grant, which was only accessible to about 50 000
children, is now enjoyed by 400 000 children.

What other measures is the Ministry considering to continue to expand these
frontiers, to ensure that those children in this age group continue to
enjoy further protection whilst these policy gaps are being explored? Thank
you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, as I’ve said,
this is work in progress but I do need to point out that poverty and income
support are but a few of the gaps that have been identified. The other gaps
in the services for children between 14 and 18 include children in conflict
with the law, child labour and the lack of services or the fact that
children are vulnerable to child labour practices. Regarding child
protection, such children are easy targets for rape, sexual and commercial
exploitation.

With regard to health, this age group is susceptible to substance abuse,
sexually transmitted infections, HIV/Aids and, with respect to education,
the highest school drop-out rate is amongst children aged 14 and over.
Alternative care and obtaining birth certificates are other gaps.

All of these issues are being addressed – as I said it is work in progress
– in an integrated implementation plan; and as soon as the Children’s
Amendment Bill is finalised, the implementation of the Children’s Act would
address a number of these gaps. All of these make up a basket of services
beyond poverty and income support and also includes the providing of
nutrition in centres in the afternoons and so on. These are all part of the
basket of services that is being looked at but the improved memorandum has
to go back to Cabinet. Thank you.

Ms J A SEMPLE: Thank you, Madam Deputy Minister for your reply. However, it
was a little disappointing because you gave a lot of intellectual responses
and all kinds of strategies, and so forth, but nothing really concrete.
Children do not cease to be children once they reach the age of 14. You
talk about child labour and children in conflict with the law but in fact
it seems that many of them don’t have any other alternative because they do
not have any other kind of support. The only concrete proposal you made is
the mention of nutrition.

My concern is that this Children’s Amendment Bill that is still hanging
around in the wings of Parliament talks about children of 16 heading child-
headed households. Now, given the lack of social workers that we have, how
are those children and the children that they are looking after going to be
able to access those services? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, I think that as a
member of the portfolio committee, the member is aware that all of these
needs are being addressed in the Bill and that as far as child-headed
households are concerned, there are already programmes running, not waiting
for the passing of the Bill; programmes in which home-based care workers go
around to visit those children and assist them to obtain the documentation
as well as the skills that they require with regard to the running of those
households and to get access to the child support grant for siblings that
might qualify for it. These services are already happening. Thank you.

 Findings of SA Academy of Science’s report on nutrition, research into the
  impact of nutrition on HIV and TB, and regulation of the industry dealing
                   with nutrition supplements and the like

451.  Dr R Rabinowitz (IFP) asked the Minister of Health:

      (1)   Whether the findings of the SA Academy of Science’s report on
            nutrition are satisfactory; if not, what is the position in this
            regard; if so, what are the relevant details;

      (2)   whether she will respond to the proposals for more extensive
            research into the impact of alternative health products and
            nutrition on HIV and TB; if not, why not; if so, what are the
            relevant details;

      (3)   whether the regulation of the industry dealing with nutrition
            supplements, complementary medicines, traditional medicines and
            medical devices will be fast-tracked; if not, why not; if so,
            when?                  NO2898E

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, thank you very much for the
opportunity to respond to the question by the hon member. I must say, first
of all, that it is important to state that the study was based primarily on
the review of available scientific literature, much of which is known to
the department. May I say to anybody who is interested in matters of health
that the outcomes of the literature review, therefore, do not necessarily
provide any new information that was unknown to the Department of Health.

The findings of the literature review reaffirm the policy position of the
Department of Health. It confirms that in addition to the two infectious
diseases – TB and HIV and Aids – South Africa also faces a challenge of
micronutrient deficiencies: Overt hunger and macronutrient deficiencies -
hidden hunger. We will recall our food fortification programme in this
regard.

It also confirms that nutrition plays a critical role in promoting good
health. Proper nutrition plays a critical role in delaying the onset of
diseases and indeed there is progression – be that in communicable or non-
communicable diseases. In itself, nutrition ... [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I suspect that the hon
Minister is answering the wrong question because the reply she is giving
here has nothing to do with the question at all.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: It is Question 450 that the Minister is answering. I
wanted to let her speak on and then follow up on the question and replace
the order. I had noticed that she was not observing and you were not
observing ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Which question is she answering?

Dr R RABINOWITZ: She is answering Question 451, and the question that is
now up for answering is Question 450. I don’t have a problem if you want to
change the order but correctly speaking we are now dealing with Question
450.

The SPEAKER: Yes, we are supposed to be on Question 450.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: But the hon Minister is answering Question 451.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: With your permission, can I just complete this
question if it doesn’t ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: In other words we are now dealing with Question 451. It is
fine. For the purpose of saving time, let’s just continue with Question
451, which is what the Minister has been dealing with, and then we will
come to Question 450.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Thank you very much for your consideration. I must
apologise for answering the wrong question. Nevertheless, I am sure the
answer that I am giving is indeed very comprehensive.

Nutrition itself is never a substitute for medical treatment when
necessary. It serves as a solid foundation that enhances the effectiveness
of medical treatment.

On the second question of Question 451, the Department of Health encourages
research on the impact of alternative health products and nutrition on HIV
and Aids. We have a research unit within the department which works in
collaboration with other research agencies such as the Medical Research
Council. The department has also allocated funds to conduct research on the
key elements of comprehensive care, management and treatment plan which
include, amongst others, nutrition.

Draft regulations related to the labelling, advertising and composition of
nutritional supplements, complementary medicines; and medical devices, are
being finalised and will soon be published in the Gazette for public
comment. Regulations related to African traditional medicines are also
being compiled but will take a little longer than the above-mentioned
categories. The finalisation is, of course, also planned for the year 2008.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Hon Minister, your interest in alternative medicine as a
support for HIV and Aids is well known and we commend you for it. But the
IFP is concerned that the development of the industry is being done in a
haphazard and nonindependent fashion. While the country races ahead with
the development of genetically modified seeds which are developed, produced
and sold by large multinationals with a questionable long-term effect on
health and resistance, the development of our traditional knowledge
receives very little attention.

We feel that without an independent Medicines Control Council, without
independent ethical research, and without independent clear mechanisms for
securing intellectual property on traditional medicines or benefit sharing
for communities, our traditional knowledge is going to be manipulated
unscrupulously by companies like Christine Qunta’s, which makes Comforter’s
Healing Gift, and claims that it heals HIV and the like by Dr Rath.

Why does the hon Minister not set up independent institutions to develop
traditional medicines? Why have we waited so long since the dismissal of
the South African Medicines and Medical Devices Regulatory Authority Bill
for these issues which you are responding to today to be implemented? Why
don’t you implement better control of genetically modified foods so that
their long-term health effects can be tracked as they emerge? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, I don’t know whether that is a
follow-up question or follow-up questions. But I will try my best to
respond to those that I think relate, in particular, to this question.

The SPEAKER: I think the Minister can respond to those that relate to this
question.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Yes. Thank you very much. I think I did mention
that we are indeed finalising the regulations in order to ensure that the
question of complementary medicine is addressed once and for all. So, I
don’t understand what the question is because I thought I had already given
an answer that, indeed, the regulations will be in place very soon.

The other question that would relate, in particular, to this question – I
am not going to talk about Genetically Modified Organisms, GMOs, here –
concerns African traditional medicine. The member is a member of the
portfolio committee, Madam Speaker. She knows how long it has taken us to
even agree on where to begin around the issues of African traditional
medicine. It is only in this week, and I think tomorrow, that we are going
to be able to finalise one step in this whole process – that is the
establishment of the African Traditional Health Practitioners Council. This
is absolutely critical for us to do before anything else.

If I had moved in another direction, I would have been accused of working
outside the legislative framework. We now have a legislative framework
which I think will be approved tomorrow. Let us, therefore, give ourselves
space and time to do things properly so that we don’t begin pointing
fingers at each other.
The issue of GMOs does not relate to this question. Thank you very much.

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker and hon Minister, pre-March 1998, the Medicines
Control Council, MCC, made no differentiation or distinction between
various paradigms of medicines. Medicinal substances of whatever paradigm
were submitted for registration and complementary medicines were controlled
like any other medicines. I can cite a few examples, St John’s Wort,
Senokot, and Fybogel. All of these complementary medicines have been
registered.

Since March 1998, the Department of Health has separated the registration
process of complementary medicines that have been free for all, which are
flooding the market. It was only in 2004, six years later, that your
department first issued draft regulations. Another three years down the
line, we are still waiting for the final version of those regulations. You
have mentioned in the reply to the hon member that these regulations will
be issued soon or implemented soon. But, hon Minister, nine years down the
line, surely you can give this House and the nation a date by when they
will be issued and implemented. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: The question that I am being asked is “by when?”
When they are ready they will be published. The hon member, who is a member
of the portfolio committee, will be the first one to know. Thank you.
Ms N F MATHIBELA: Hon Minister, is it not ironic that some amongst us in
this House do not seem to recognise our respect for the views of entities
that this Parliament funds, such as the Academy of Science of South Africa?
They, thus, present their views as contrary to what is a subject of ongoing
research in the field of biomedical science. However, hon Minister, can you
provide timeframes for the completion of these regulations? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: The department informed me that by the end of
November the regulations will be in place. Hon member, you are also a
member of the portfolio committee. I think that this information would have
been communicated to the portfolio committee by the officials. Thank you.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister, may I address the
specific issue of the recommendation by the Academy of Science of South
Africa into further research into the use of traditional and alternative
medicines to treat TB and HIV?

Hon Minister, you appear to have been perfectly happy until now to advocate
the use of such medicines within the framework of uncontrolled trials. I
would specifically like you to answer the question as to what measures you
would take to do further research in these areas but in a manner that is
ethically controlled and well managed, independently and scientifically
managed? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Deputy Speaker, if we go through Hansard, I am on
record as saying to this House that with regard to African traditional and
alternative medicines, whatever, as a department we will continue to do
proper research in order to ensure the safety and efficacy of the medicines
that we use as a department. I am on record in this regard. I don’t know
what else I must say except to re-endorse the statements that I have always
made in this House. Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That then brings us to the question the Minister should
have dealt with earlier, Question 450.

   Outcome of research on hoodia plant by SA Medical Research Council, and
                     patent granted as a result thereof

450.  Dr R Rabinowitz (IFP) asked the Minister of Health:

      (1)   Whether the research on the hoodia plant conducted by the SA
          Medical Research Council, SAMRC, and Pfizer resulted in an active
          chemical being isolated for use in appetite suppression; if so,

      (2)   whether a patent has been granted in respect of the chemical; if
          not, why not; if so, (a) in which countries, (b) which entity
          holds the patent, (c)(i) what benefit-sharing agreement was
          negotiated and (ii) with which community was it negotiated and
          (d) when will it (i) be implemented and (ii) become commercially
          available;

      (3)   whether she will make a statement on the matter?   NO2897E

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Hon member, thank you very much for your
understanding that I answered Question 451 instead of Question 450.

With regard to question one, the SA Medical Research Council reports that
they have never conducted any research on the hoodia plant. That’s what
they told me. The SA Medical Research Council, with regard to your question
two, therefore, does not hold any patent on this plant. Therefore, the
answer to question three is ``no’’. This is the information supplied to me
by the SA Medical Research Council. Thank you.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Hon Minister, the answer you have given to this question
is completely amazing, because presentations have been given to the Health
committee by the Human Sciences Research Council and the SA Medical
Research Council indicating that research, indeed, was being conducted on
the hoodia plant. Also, that the hoodia plant is widely available, making
claims that it is a weight-reducing plant.

This just indicates how poorly we are developing regulations and law to
develop our intellectual property on traditional medicines. It is an
industry that could be worth billions and billions of rands to the people
who have this traditional knowledge, yet nothing is being done to develop
it. It relates to the points I made before: Until we have an independent
ethics committee, independent research and a clear will to develop these
products, our traditional knowledge is just going to be lost. [Time
expired.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Your time has expired and there is no supplementary
question coming from what you said but, Minister, it is up to you if you
want to comment on that statement.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Well, I was just about to say I don’t know whether
that’s a supplementary question. It isn’t, indeed.

I would just like to say that I am surprised that a Member of Parliament
would not know the efforts that this government is making with regard to
indigenous knowledge and that she does not know that we have ethics
committees at national level and at the different institutions. I cannot
believe that. But the question, of course, is not a supplementary question.
Thank you very much.

Mr M WATERS: Hon Minister, the hoodia plant is becoming quite a valuable
plant. It actually now costs $40 an ounce. It’s almost priced as a narcotic
in the world. And if you go on to Google and you google the word, you will
see 40 million responses. So the world seems to have caught on to the plant
and what it can do.
In this country, it is promoted as a cutting-edge advanced appetite
suppressant, metabolism booster, fat burner and energy enhancer all in one.
In America, for example, the Federal Trade Commission has just announced
that they are to recover $25 million to settle allegations of deceptive
marketing tactics of this product.

You stated here that the Medicines Control Council have conducted no
trials, yet people are allowed to sell this product openly in the market
because the regulations which we’ve been waiting for for nine years are not
forthcoming and you can’t give us a date by when they are coming. What are
you going to do to protect the consumer in this country against false
advertising and false claims? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Deputy Speaker, my understanding is That is the
core business of Trade and Industry. Thank you.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Now that the Minister knows that the plant is a South
African plant and that there is a lot of financial value in it, and she
also knows, as a Member of Parliament, that the Human Sciences Research
Council can do research, and that the Department of Science and Technology
can assist her department to get it patented, will she take it up and see
to it that this becomes a registered, patented South African plant?

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Deputy Speaker, I think the member also knows the
processes of applying to do research in this country. If they don’t want to
listen to me, Deputy Speaker, I’ll sit down. I have no problem with sitting
down if they don’t want to listen, but I will continue.

I was saying he knows the processes - what the MRC would do once they think
it is necessary. They put priorities to the department. We look at the
application, of course, after it has gone through the ethics committees and
so on. Finally, we agree as a department that this is what needs to be
done. This information which has been provided might assist us in engaging
the MRC and the HSRC as to what to do next. I must thank the members for
the valuable information that they have just provided. Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Dr Rabinowitz, you are making things very difficult for
us. Why don’t you ask questions from your seat? We have to deal with
records of the institution, and it keeps on saying Mr Lucas, who is not in
the House. Will you please go to your seat, ma’am, and ask your question
from there?

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Hon Minister, to provide some information for you: In the
hearings that we have had as the Health committee, we have been informed
that the research was undertaken with Pfizer and abandoned because no
active chemical principle was found. So, that begs the question why further
research has not been undertaken, not to look for an active chemical but to
look for the overall effect of the entire plant.
Following up on the question that was asked by the DA, is it not your
responsibility as the person in charge of the SA Medical Research Council
and the Human Sciences Research Council’s medical division to see to it
that this research is done in a responsible fashion? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Deputy Speaker, before I come and answer questions
in Parliament, if the information I require emanates from any other body, I
ask that body to provide me with information. And, therefore, the answer
that I gave is in fact a report that I got from the SAMRC, in a nutshell. I
have also just said that the information that I now have might assist me to
go back and see what we can do.

Yes, it is my responsibility as the Minister of Health to do those things
that promote indigenous knowledge in this country and to ensure the safety
of medicines in the country, be they alternative or traditional medicines.
The efficacy of medicines is indeed our responsibility. I thought I had
said ``Thank you’’, and I want once more to say ``Thank you very much for
the information’’, and I don’t know what further to say except to say
``Thank you’’, ``Thank you’’, ``Thank you’’!

 Measures against underspending of budgets by provincial housing departments

 485. Ms Z A Kota (ANC) asked the Minister of Housing:

      Whether her department intends taking any measures against the
      underspending of budgets by provincial housing departments; if not,
      why not; if so, what are the relevant details?           NO2934E

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Deputy Speaker, I have just sent you a note and I
would like to thank you for taking note of my concerns. Thank you very
much.

Over the past three years we have had a very good record of spending –
spending up to 96% of our allocation. We guard our successes very jealously
and we have developed steps to ensure that there are no roll-overs in
Housing. We have done this to an extent that it is possible for us to avoid
them.

Accordingly, at every Ministers and Members of the Executive Council,
Minmec, meeting, we take time to go over our expenditure patterns and
normally dispatch a team from our finance section to assist where we
perceive there is a problem. For the first time this year we decided to
take money away from provinces that show no promise of using their
allocation. A special Minmec meeting was, therefore, called to discuss
special circumstances we found ourselves in. This year we resolved, at this
Minmec meeting, that the reallocation option would be used instead.

Furthermore, we have ensured that provinces that have not performed so well
are assisted to ensure that they deal with the problems that they are
encountering. We also keep a very short leash on such provinces to ensure
that the money is spent. There is no way that we can have a roll-over when
we have such a shortage of housing. Thank you.

Ms Z A KOTA: Thank you, Minister, for your comprehensive answer. You spoke
a number of times at the committee about delinking housing subsidies from
housing projects. Will this also assist provincial departments with
patterns of expenditure? Do you think it will also improve or address the
question of underspending?

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Thank you very much, hon “Zo” Kota. The issue of
delinking subsidy from allocation is something that we have been concerned
with for some time now to ensure that our Housing Subsidy Scheme – HSS - is
in very good health. This is also something that has been used by MECs to
indicate some of the problems that they have in delivery – something that
they say is slowing down delivery.

However, we have looked at the matter and discovered that it is only a
small portion of the problem that we have. We have taken this on board and
we are dealing with it. We think that the bigger problem is nonalignment
between what we do at local level and what we do at provincial level.
We are dealing, together with the Minister for Provincial and Local
Government, with the issue of the Municipal Infrastructure Grant, MIG,
allocation where we are required to pass on money to municipalities who
might not be ready for this kind of allocation. When we have streamlined
our allocation system to ensure that the lowest level, which is the local
level, is in a position to use this money, I think we will then be over
most of the problem with our allocations. Thank you.

Mr S J MASANGO: Hon Minister, the criterion used to allocate funds to
provinces is an old one based on demands per province. For the Minister to
fairly punish provincial departments for nondelivery, wouldn’t the Minister
consider another criterion like allocating funds according to business
plans and cause analysis, which will force provinces to perform according
to their business plans?

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: I would love to have that power. The Ministers
here who have the same problem as I do are just nodding and saying they
would love to have Members of Parliament suggesting that we take over that
power. That would be good for us.

Unfortunately, no. Allocation to provinces is determined in the Division of
Revenue Act allocations and we have a set formula which we just carry
through. But we would like to take what you are suggesting into account –
that we would need to get, from provinces, some kind of business plan that
will give us additional responsibility and power to ensure that they do
deliver.

However, hon Masango, perhaps you can make an amendment to the law. You
would get a lot of support from members from this side. Thank you.

Mr A C STEYN: Minister, yes, the spending record for the last three years
has been good. However, this does not necessarily translate into good
delivery. With that aside, we are dealing with underspending here. I want
to put this to the Minister: Is the redirection of funds to other provinces
the only option? Shouldn’t one deal with the root cause of an
underexpenditure, that is, keeping officials and provincial departments
responsible for the underexpenditure? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Deputy Speaker, I would like to correct the
terminology that the hon member uses. The expenditure has not been good; it
has been very good. There is a big difference. We had a very good record
and I would have wanted you to actually acknowledge that.

Yes, we had a problem where spending did not relate directly to delivery.
But the problem that we had was projects which we had to block along the
way and which we are now dealing with as block projects. Once we have done
this, hopefully what we put in will result in the number of houses on the
ground.

Yes, we would very much like to ensure that officials at provincial level
are held accountable for what they do. I do not know what else I can do
from where I sit. I could withhold their salaries – is that what you are
suggesting? I would love to do that. I would like to have the power to do
just that because ultimately I have to stand here and answer to why we have
any underexpenditure. Ultimately, when people out there hear that there is
underexpenditure in such a critical area as Housing, we will then have a
lot of problems.

Beyond what we have done, I am very grateful to you in the portfolio
committee for the support you have given. I think there is very little that
we can do. What we have at our disposal is to withhold money. I think it is
working very well because right now we are getting ripples across the
system. Thank you.

   Termination and or awarding of contracts with SA Post Office and other
                              service providers

469.  Mr C M Lowe (DA) asked the Minister of Home Affairs:

      (1)   In light of her department having recently terminated the
            services of the SA Post Office, Sapo, as a distributor of its
            documents to post-box addresses and reviewing all its service-
            level agreements and its decision to choose one service provider
            to do everything, (a) what are the reasons for some of her
            department’s contracts with Sapo not being cancelled and (b)
            what is the current status of the review;

      (2)   whether any other contracts with service providers have been
            terminated; if not, why not; if so, with which service
            providers;

      (3)   whether a single service provider has been awarded a contract by
            her department; if not, why not; if so, which service provider?
                                                         NO2916E

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Thank you, Deputy Speaker and hon member. The
department is currently finalising its new identity document process
mapping exercise as part of the turnaround project, which includes the
collection of IDs. This process will define the most efficient way of
distributing IDs to their owners. There are currently a number of service
providers that are responsible for collecting applications and distributing
IDs and this includes Sapo.

The work of these service providers was not managed in terms of any real
contract or service-level agreement and there is, therefore, a termination
of an arrangement rather than a contract. Thus the open-ended nature of
this working arrangement has affected efficiency and resulted in documents
being lost. And for purposes of improving efficiency and accountability,
the department has decided to consolidate the work of collection and
delivery in one service provider. Given the fact that XPS is currently one
of the service providers and is wholly owned by Sapo as a state-owned
enterprise, we have started negotiations with them.

With regard to the third question, owing to a general problem with contract
management within the department, the turnaround project is currently
reviewing all major contracts and service-level agreements with service
providers, particularly the large ones that have a direct impact on our
ability to deliver an efficient service to our clients.

At its conclusion this process will determine the nature of action that is
required with regard to each one of those contracts. Lastly, no contract
has been signed with XPS but discussions are under way towards
finalisation. Thank you.

Mr C M LOWE: Deputy Speaker, thank you very much indeed, and to you, hon
Minister, thank you very much once again for a very frank response. It is
not the first time that you have been frank about the conditions of your
department. I would like to thank you for that frankness. I would also like
to assure you of the support of the DA in fixing the problems in Home
Affairs.

We all know what the problems are now. You and your director-general have
been more than candid with South Africa. I think together we need to fix
those problems for the people of South Africa.

On that basis I’d just like to ask a number of questions around the
provision of these services because just as the refugees in South Africa
have human rights that they need to have taken care of – they have certain
rights that everybody writes and talks about – so the citizens of this
country too, who rely on the services of Home Affairs, have the same rights
to access those services which, as you and I both know, hasn’t been
happening as it should be for some time.

Around the provision of the service of providing documentation, could I
just ask – perhaps it is difficult to reply in the sense that you are in
negotiations – if you could give assurances that those who are responsible
for those negotiations will ensure that the new provider of that service
can actually deliver; that certain safeguards are put into those contracts;
that there will be penalty clauses; that the documentation will be received
on time; that there will be standards set in the contracts, for example,
how many days before the document will be received. I think that’s what
South Africa needs; just an assurance that it will happen. [Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Yes, hon member, the reason why we have gone
the route of reviewing all major contracts is precisely because we have
uncovered that one of the biggest challenges has been a lack of penalties
in our contracts in our service-level agreements. But secondly, I can
indicate to you, perhaps because I know that there has been a lot of
controversy around this Sapo issue, that in the main it had to do with the
fact that, much as we call an ID a secure document, the manner in which
these IDs were being distributed was not of a secure nature.

So, we hope that with XPS and with the service-level agreement which we are
going to be signing with them, there will be those kinds of penalties but
also from the side of XPS that there will be an appreciation of the fact
that the kind of document we are dealing with is in fact a secure document.
Thank you.

Mr C M LOWE: Deputy Speaker, thank you very much indeed. Hon Minister, once
again, thank you for that response. Could I perhaps just ask this: It
appears from your answer to the question that you’re considering using XPS.
Now my understanding is that XPS is part of the SA Post Office but it is
certainly a separate entity. My concern is just that, to quote somebody
very senior in your department, your “department is just as dysfunctional
as the SA Post Office”.

I am concerned that the SA Post Office doesn’t have a very good track
record in this. How confident are you that XPS is actually going to
deliver? Surely we should be thinking out of the box and perhaps look at
external service providers, perhaps somebody in the private sector who will
be more motivated by other reasons of delivery rather than XPS.

I respect the fact that XPS has the right to be a contender but surely we
should look wider than that and, given the condition the SA Post Office is
in now and the fact that it hasn’t delivered in the past, we should be
looking further than that. Perhaps you could just make some comments on
that. Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: I don’t think it has anything to do with the
inefficiency or inability of Sapo to render this kind of service. I think
that the major challenge, as I indicated earlier on, has been in the nature
of the relationship which we had, in terms of which, firstly, there was no
service-level agreement, so there were no penalties. But, obviously, having
learnt from the mistakes committed in the past, much as XPS is an entity of
Sapo, we believe that if we have a good service-level agreement and proper
monitoring systems in place, but also penalties, XPS will be able to
discharge this function in a better manner.

But I also have to say that the biggest challenge we had with Sapo was
that, as you know, IDs would simply be distributed, so there was no mailing
which was secure which could guarantee that documents would reach their
owners. At times, as we talked, for instance, it was even difficult to
ascertain how many documents had been distributed and how many had not been
distributed.

But we believe that we’ll do better with XPS, much as it is part of Sapo,
because we don’t think the problem was in the main with Sapo; we think that
it was in the casual and informal manner in which we were relating with
Sapo. If we had had penalties from the beginning, if we’d had a service-
level agreement properly drafted, if we’d had proper monitoring systems, I
think that we could have avoided some of the difficulties which we have
encountered from them. Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Lowe, it looks like you are the only person
interested in this. Would you like to have another slot? [Laughter.]

Mr C M LOWE: You are very kind, Deputy Speaker. Thank you ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: It’s not I. These are the Rules that say you can have
up to four supplementary questions.

Mr C M LOWE: If the hon Minister would indulge me, perhaps I can just ask
her to comment on the following: Obviously, any service agreement, we hope,
will hold the service provider to a maximum number of days within which
they will have to deliver documentation, be it, normally, an ID document,
but it could also be other documents.

Perhaps I could ask - I am stepping a little wide off the mark - if she
could comment whether within the department itself will start setting
targets on how many days we will take to produce those documents because
it’s all very well delivering documents in three days, for example, but if
it is taking six months or even four months to produce, it doesn’t help us
get very far. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Mr Lowe, I thought you were aware of the fact
that the ID processing workstream is dealing with precisely that issue of
setting targets; one, for collection of applications, two, for processing
of IDs, but, three, also for the distribution of those IDs. I think we have
also indicated that if there is an interest we can come and brief the
portfolio committee in detail about those targets and I think some of the
targets referred to were actually announced last week.

They look very ambitious but we believe that we will be able to do it with
proper planning and proper supervision of the officials working in those
particular areas. Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is an extra slot but I’m not going to give it to
Mr Lowe because this is now becoming a portfolio committee on Home Affairs
and we are now also drifting away from the SA Post Office to other areas in
Home Affairs.

  Measures to ensure no negative impact by National Credit Act on students
                         from disadvantaged families

492.  Ms P R Mashangoane (ANC) asked the Minister of Education:

      What measures are in place in ensuring that the National Credit Act,
      Act 34 of 2005, does not impact negatively on students from
      disadvantaged families?                                       NO2942E

[The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I would like to thank the hon delegate, Ms
Mashangoane. My answer is: Parents who are paying school fees can do it in
three ways. The first way is to pay off the whole amount for the year, the
second way to pay is on a monthly basis and the third way is to pay once
per term.

Paying in this manner does not fall under the Credit Act. If you as a
parent borrow money from someone to pay the fees, then that will fall under
the National Credit Act.

It is not our school policy to lend parents money to pay school fees. I do
not know of any school that lends parents money to pay school fees. Our
schools and their payments do not fall under the National Credit Act.

Speaking of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, this is the scheme
that assists students at universities and universities of technology with
finance. It gives them bursaries and also loans, but loans fall under the
National Credit Act.

Section 78(2)(a) of this Act says that institutions and students must not
make a loan that they would not be able to pay back. Section 78 of that Act
is looking at that area.

As employees of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, who assist
students with loans to further their studies at universities, we try to
lend them funds that they will be able to pay back.

Another thing that we are doing as regards the National Student Financial
Aid Scheme is, if a student performs well in the exams, 40% of the loan is
converted to a bursary and 60% of the loan stays as a loan and it is the
one which falls under the National Credit Act.

We wait until the student gets employment before he or she start paying the
National Student Financial Aid Scheme back. You do not start paying on the
first day of your employment but we wait until you earn R58 000 per annum
before you can start paying the National Student Financial Aid Scheme back.

What I can say is that with the Education Act, we are trying to help
students who are getting loans from the National Student Financial Aid
Scheme to be up on their feet and only then can they start paying back
their loans. [Time expired.]]

Ms P R MASHANGOANE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker, and thank you, hon Minister,
and thank you again for your detailed response. Minister, can one really
say the impact of the National Credit Act on students will be minimal,
given the fact that so many students have to apply to banks and tertiary
institutions for loans? Would the Minister agree that the department should
investigate further the impact of the National Credit Act upon students?
Thank you, Chairperson.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I do not think we would want to investigate it
unless we are made aware of a particular challenge or problem. However, it
is important to state that if students borrow money from banks, those are
registered as lending institutions under the National Credit Act. The
universities in our country which have a loans granting system have to be
registered as credit providers under the National Credit Act.

However, as I have said with regard to the National Student Financial Aid
Scheme, we are excluded because the scheme excludes students from the
provisions of the Act and therefore the scheme, given its operations within
a statute, is not considered to be a lending institution in the broad term
of the recklessness that is being guarded against by the National Credit
Act.

As I have said, the arrangement that we have made seeks to allow young
people to look for work and only begin repayment once they earn a
particular salary. This does serve as a means of assisting young people to
be able to meet the obligations. The fact that R341 million of money
borrowed and paid back by graduates went back into loans this year for
other students indicates that graduates are able to meet their obligations
that arise from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme.

Mr G G BOINAMO: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Minister, you know as well
as I do that there are highly performing learners who unfortunately happen
to come from indigent families and also live in deep rural areas where
information systems are totally out of reach. What systems are in place to
allow such learners to benefit from the National Credit Act? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I am not sure if we would want to have learners
benefit from the National Credit Act except in so far that the institutions
they borrow money from should not be reckless in lending money to people
who clearly cannot meet their obligations as borrowers.

Now, in terms of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and providing
information to those students - if that is what the hon member meant - what
we are doing is ensuring that we spread this information as widely as
possible. We have begun a national outreach campaign to senior secondary
students, that is, those learners who are in the FET phase - from Grade 10
- to inform them about FET colleges throughout the country; how you apply
for the bursaries available for that; and the National Student Financial
Aid Scheme and its accessibility once you have succeeded in passing Grade
12.

This information is, of course, now being distributed. We have pamphlets
that we are providing to libraries in communities, to the Thusong Centres,
directly to schools, through the Umsobomvu Youth Fund and through youth
organisations so that we try as far as possible to reach every young person
wherever they may be located. We also utilise some non-governmental
organisations that have a very strong rural outreach record as part of the
organisations that assist us in identifying deserving and talented young
people who should have access to bursaries and loans from the National
Student Financial Aid Scheme.

Mnu A M MPONTSHANE: Ngiyabonga Phini likaSomlomo. Ngeshwa, mhlonishwa,

(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Thank you, Madam Deputy Chairperson. Unfortunately, hon
member, I was not able to understand fully what you said in your initial
response. I do not quite understand the language that you spoke. I
understand just a little bit. The interpreter says ...]

... When students apply for loans they are restricted on how much they can
repay. The question arises: If they are restricted on what they can repay,
what happens to the rest if they cannot afford to top up what they have
received already according to the restrictions? That is one question.

Lo okade etolika uthi futhi ... [However, according to the interpreter ...]

... the scheme will only ask the student to repay once he or she is on
their feet.

Angazi-ke ukuthi kusuke kunjani lapho. Sengigcina-ke mhlonishwa .. [I do
not know why that is the case. Finally, hon member ..] [Time expired.]]

UNGQONGQOSHE WEZEMFUNDO: Umuntu osisiza ngokutolika angimqondi kahle.

Nami angizwa ukuthi ubethini kodwa uyazi ukuthi ingane efuna ukuboleka

iyamcindezela lento yokukhokhela isikweletu semali abeyibolekwe isikhwama
semfundo sikazwelonke. Ngiyethemba ukuthi ke siyezwana. (Translation of
isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I also do not quite follow what the person who
is helping us with interpreting is saying.

However, you know that when a student wants to borrow money from the
national bursary fund, it is first determined how much money the parents
have. The money that he or she will get from the national bursary fund is
augmented by the money that they will get from the university. Some get a
bursary based on their good performance in their matriculation
examinations, some get the money elsewhere, while some universities have
what is referred to as funding from the parents of the students. Therefore,
all these things are combined.

So, it is possible for a student to be subsidised fully through the
national bursary fund without first determining the financial status of the
parents. Some receive small amounts for buying books while others are given
money to pay accommodation fees at the residences of the educational
institutions, etc. When you mention the writing off of this money, I do not
know where you get that from because I certainly did not talk about that.

Let me respond to the issue of refunding the money. What I am saying here
is that when a student gets employed, he or she is likely to refund R30
000. However, the student must owe the national bursary fund at least R62
000 before he or she starts paying back the money because we do not want a
situation in which he or she is being pressurised to repay the national
bursary fund. I hope we understand each other.]

So you have to repay the loan because it survives on the basis that the
money circulates and that you repay the loan amount in order to assist
other young people. But, as I have said, 40% of that money is converted to
a bursary upon success. If you do not succeed, clearly then you do have a
burden because then all the money remains a loan. However, for those
students who complete their studies, as they complete, a proportion of what
they have borrowed becomes a bursary and they remain with a portion which
is a loan.

We have also found out that the salary levels in South Africa do allow
young people to pay the loans back. [Time expired.]

(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Mr G G BOINAMO: Thank you, Minister of Education. When giving students
loans that they can afford to repay, can’t we consider first how much they
are going to need for completion of their studies in the institutions of
higher learning? Is that not disadvantaging them to complete their studies
because the money they have loaned is the amount that they can afford? In
some instances these loans are insufficient to pay off the whole amount of
their fees for the completion of their studies, even though they have to
repay it. I want to know whether they can’t be assisted with loans that can
help them till the completion of their studies instead of having to quit
due to a shortage of funds? Thank you.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Part of what we face as a country is that when
the scheme was introduced the view that was held generally by the South
African public and parties in the House was that all persons who are in
need of financial aid should receive support wherever they are studying.
And the costs, as you know, of universities differ vastly - there are some
that are very expensive and some that do not charge as much as the norm.

So you do have difficulty with what is called the full cost of studying.
Hence in some institutions you find that because they are going to divide
the money amongst all the needy students and given the differences in need
– that some need R500 while others need R15 000 – the money can’t satisfy
all the needs and government is not able to provide sufficient funding to
assist all needy students.
Hence the range of schemes that are in place, some with government support,
such as the recent Fundisa Scheme which was announced by government,
putting in R20 million to encourage parents, together with the private
sector’s R14 million, to save funds through a collective scheme created
specifically for the purpose of assisting and supporting South Africans to
save for the education of their children at higher education level.

What I am trying to say in replying to your question is that the need is
vast because we have many talented children and higher education is
expensive. What we are doing is to ensure that we create a diverse range of
mechanisms so that all the needs may be met and also to encourage us as
parents to play a role in supporting the education of our children.

I think the National Student Financial Aid Scheme does an amazing job in
terms of contributing to the success of young people in our country and
clearly the private sector coming on board to support is a very positive
initiative but the need is huge.

       Establishment of community libraries in 2006-07 financial year

481.  Mrs T J Tshivhase (ANC) asked the Minister of Arts and Culture:

      Whether any community libraries have been established in the 2006-07
      financial year, especially in rural areas and townships; if not, (a)
      why not and (b) what are the challenges in this regard; if so, how
      many?                                   NO2930E

The MINISTER OF ARTS  AND  CULTURE:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  The  following
responses were received from the heads of the provincial  library  services:
Eastern Cape, no community libraries were established  during  2006-07.  The
reasons for this were that the infrastructure budget that was allocated  was
for  the  Butterworth  library  and  there  was   a   limited   budget   for
infrastructure.

In the Free State, two community libraries  were  opened  in  rural-township
areas, namely: Fateng-tse-Ntsho in Dihlabeng  Local  Municipality  in  Thabo
Mofutsanyana District  Municipality;  Qalabotjha  Library  in  Mafube  Local
Municipality in Fezile Dabi District Municipality; two libraries  are  under
construction for  opening  in  the  current  financial  year  and  they  are
Refengkgotso Library  in  Metsimaholo  Local  Municipality  in  Fezile  Dabi
District  Municipality;  and  the  Selosesha  Library  in  Thaba-Nchu  -  in
Mangaung Local Municipality in Motheo District Municipality.

In Gauteng, construction of 12 new libraries and the upgrading of one
library with funding from the municipalities was started in 2006-07:
Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality - Jabavu in Soweto, River Park in
Alexandra, Ivory Park North and Tshepisong in Soweto. Ekurhuleni
Metropolitan Municipality - Tembisa West Community Library opened on 27
January 2007. Upgrading of the Olifantsfontein Library has been approved
for 2006-07. New libraries for Vosloorus and Langaville are also on the
budget. In Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality there are new libraries in
Winterveld, Garankuwa, Klipkruisfontein, and Nelmaphius in Mamelodi. In
Mogale City there will be a new library at Hekpoort.

In KwaZulu-Natal, seven new libraries were built. One in  Nongoma,  Hlabisa,
Ixopo, Ingwe, Mtubatuba, Eastwood, and in Msunduzi. In Limpopo, one  library
was established at Mankweng, Polokwane Municipality  with  municipal  funds.
No libraries were built with provincial funds. That was owing  to  financial
constraints and there was no budget.  In  Mpumalanga,  no  formal  community
libraries were built.  Alternative  library  services  were  established  to
provide access to information. A book-box was established in  Sandriver  and
a  container  library  was  established  in  Zwelisha.  This  was  owing  to
financial constraints, capacity and financial challenges.

In  the  Northern  Cape,  no  community  libraries  were  built,  owing   to
insufficient funding for capital projects. In the North-West,  construction,
or planning of construction, of five  community  libraries  as  started  and
mobile libraries were established in Taung,  Morokweng,  Ikageng,  Manamele,
and there is also a relocation of the Tlhabane  Library.  There  is  also  a
community library  in  Rustenburg  and  a  mobile  one  for  each  of  these
districts.

In the Western Cape, six new libraries were built –  both  from  the  public
and community. There is another one in Nelspoort in the Beaufort West  Local
Municipality; and in Buffeljagsrivier in the Swellendam Local  Municipality.
There are library depots  as  extended  rural  service  delivery  points  in
Klipdale, Vleiplaas, Slanghoek, and Nieuwedrift. I thank you.

Tshivenda paragraph follows.)

[Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Deputy Speaker, hon Minister, reading makes one clever.
If we look at the rural areas far away, we find that there are no libraries
for which there is a serious need. Which other things are replacing the
libraries in rural areas – I mean, in a very rural place? This will be to
promote a tendency for reading books. Our people are seriously in need of
libraries.]

What about the remotest rural areas? Why are there no libraries there so
that people could also engage in reading?

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: I think the hon member should appreciate
that we disburse the funds to the provinces, who in turn disburse them to
the municipalities. As I have already explained, in some provinces, they
haven’t built any. Not because we haven’t disbursed the money to them but
due to the way they have distributed it and found that they are under
certain constraints.

We don’t determine where the provinces will establish libraries nor do we
determine which municipalities they should disburse the money to. We can
only initiate a programme, make the money available, and it is the
provinces that make the final decision about how the money is spent.

Mev D VAN DER WALT: Dankie agb Adjunk-Speaker. Minister, biblioteke is
inderdaad ‘n provinsiale aangeleentheid, maar ek dink die antwoord wat u so
pas aan die voorsitter van die komitee gegee het, is baie duidelik. Ek dink
die geld moet onvoorwaardelik na hulle toe gaan. Dan sal ons dit sien. U is
bekend daarvoor dat u absoluut ‘n kultuur van lees wil bevorder en ek
ondersteun u daarmee baie ernstig sedert ek in die Parlement gekom het.

Dit is inderdaad so dat u beheer sal moet kan neem oor hierdie geld van die
department wat na die provinsies toe gaan, want ons mense wat ongeletterd
is en wat in die verre platteland bly, het nie geleenthede om na biblioteke
in die dorpe te gaan nie. Wat word van hulle? Dis baie duidelik. U het nou
weer gesê Limpopo het al weer nie ‘n biblioteek gebou nie. Daar is ‘n groot
krisis daar en ek kan nie sien dat die nasionale department aanhoudend geld
kan verskaf, maar die geld verdwyn of word nie benut vir dit waarvoor die
intensie daar is nie. Ons gaan nooit by die mense uitkom nie, en ek wil
weet of u dit gaan ondersoek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Mrs D VAN DER WALT: Thank you, hon Deputy Speaker. Minister, libraries are
indeed a provincial matter, but I think the answer you have just given to
the chairperson of the committee is very clear. I think the money should go
to them unconditionally. Then we will see it. You are known for absolutely
wanting to promote a culture of reading and I have supported you very
seriously with that since I arrived in Parliament.

It is indeed true that you should be able to take over control of this
money of the department which goes to the provinces because our people who
are illiterate and who live in outlying rural areas do not have the
opportunity to go to libraries in the towns. What becomes of them? It is
very clear. You have just said that Limpopo has once again not built a
library. There is a huge crisis there and I cannot see how the national
department can continually supply money, but that the money disappears or
is not utilised for the purpose for which it was intended. We are never
going to reach the people, and I would like to know if you are going to
investigate this.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Deputy Speaker, I want to thank the hon
member for her suggestion, but unfortunately, unless we are going to amend
the Constitution, I won’t have those sorts of powers. However, what one
tries to do is to enter into a dialogue with the provincial governments so
that there is some sort of making up of minds about these matters. I think
it is much too radical a step to take - to amend the Constitution, just to
enable me to build libraries where I see the need.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Van der Walt, there is an extra slot. Rather than
shouting, take a slot and ask another question.

Mrs D VAN DER WALT: Baie dankie, agb Adjunk-Speaker. [Thank you, hon Deputy
Speaker.]

We have seen conditional grants in the budget that you had. I am not saying
that you must amend the Constitution. Just make the money conditional. That
will help. I don’t know whether you are prepared to do that and go into
negotiations with the provinces. I thank you.

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Deputy Speaker, I think the hon member is
absolutely right. Yes of course, if we give you the money to do a, b, c,
and d, that is conditional, but if we just disburse money to you and say,
as a province, here is money for community libraries and you may choose,
there are no conditions. If there is an instance where we have identified
very obvious needs and the province doesn’t come through, then of course we
will be within our rights to withhold that money until they come through,
but we haven’t done that.

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Dankie Minister. Ons is baie bly vir die groot bedrae
geld wat u spandeer aan die bou van biblioteke, maar een van die
fundamentele vereistes vir die effektiewe gebruik van ‘n biblioteek is die
vermoë van ons leerlinge om te kan lees. Ons tel groot probleme op in die
verslae wat ons kry. Daar is probleme op skoolvlak rondom die vermoë om te
lees. As u met my saamstem sal ek dit waardeer as u miskien die Minister
van Onderwys kan uitneem vir ‘n ete en ‘n vriendelike kollegiale gesprek.
Dankie Minister. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Thank you, Minister. We are very glad about the large
sums of money you are spending on the building of libraries, but one of the
fundamental requirements for the effective use of a library, is the ability
of our learners to read. We have identified major problems from the reports
we received. There are problems at school level concerning the ability to
read. If you agree with me, I would appreciate it if you could, perhaps,
take the Minister of Education out to lunch or dinner and have a friendly,
collegial discussion. Thank you, Minister.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: So af en toe het ek by die Minister van
Onderwys ... [Every now and then the Minister of Education and I ...]
[Laughter.]

I don’t think there is any need for anyone to suggest that I take her out
to dinner. No, no, that is not the problem. [Laughter.] Our difficulty in
terms of a culture of reading in South Africa is that we are, in fact, not
a reading nation. That is our primary difficulty. When we did a survey on
this matter, we found that in something like 50% of households in South
Africa, there are no books at all. Very few parents read to their children.
Those are the difficulties. Hopefully the libraries will assist us in
breaking the culture of non-reading.

The other difficulty which we face, and are trying to address as the
department, is that in many instances, before people can have access to
books, they have to leap over a hurdle in that there are very few books
published in the languages that they use at home. This is why we have been
driving this process of trying to get more and more books published in the
indigenous African languages so that you can read a book in the language
you use at home and get accustomed to reading that way rather than having
to learn a new language before you can read.

These are the efforts we are trying to make to break through on that
particular front. I thank you.

   Effects of transfer of funds from Eastern Cape housing budget to other
                                  provinces

454.  Mr A C Steyn (DA) asked the Minister of Housing:

      (1)   Whether, with regard to her announcement that R500 million is to
          be transferred from the Eastern Cape’s housing budget to other
          “performing” provinces, the transfer of “budgeted” funds by the
          Eastern Cape will have any effect on any existing projects that
          have already started; if not; why not; if so, what effects;

      (2)   (a) on what basis were the recipient provinces, Gauteng, KwaZulu-
          Natal, Northern Cape and the Western Cape identified and (b) what
          (i) steps have been put in place or are envisaged to ensure that
          the additional funds will be spent efficiently within the current
          financial year and (ii) effect will the transfer from the Eastern
          Cape have on their portion of future funds over the medium-term
          budget period;
      (3)   whether her department has taken any steps to assist provinces
          who fail to spend their allocated budgets; if not, why not; if
          so, what steps?                                NO2901E

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Madam Deputy Speaker, the hon member wants to know
whether our transfer of R500 million from the Eastern Cape has had any
effect on that province; if not why not?

The reply is as follows: No, it did not have any effect on the Eastern
Cape, precisely because the money that we have taken from them is the money
they would not have used anyway. It is the money that they had not already
committed in their allocation. As early as 23 August 2007, we engaged with
the province and indicated to them that unless their expenditure improved,
we would have to take away that money. So by the time we took that money
away in October, they had already made the necessary preparations, I think,
psychologically, that the money would be taken away.

So I don’t think that any of the money that has been removed would have
affected them adversely. I think that the projects that they are running
right now have been sufficiently budgeted for and this money would not have
been used anyway.

The hon member also wants to know on what basis we have chosen KwaZulu-
Natal, Gauteng, Northern Cape and Western Cape as recipients of the money
that was withdrawn from the Eastern Cape. We had a number of criteria and
chief amongst them was that we had decided that most of the money would be
used for emergency housing, especially as we go into this particular period
of the year.

Therefore, what we would have wanted to ensure was that these are provinces
that would have a high priority need for emergency housing. These are
provinces that would already have spent well up to the particular time that
the money was allocated to them. Also, these are provinces that would have
had business plans submitted previously for unfunded projects which in
terms of the allocation that we had we were unable to fund and, therefore,
these are plans that we could very easily dust off and use.

The hon member also wants to find out what we are doing to ensure that
these provinces that receive our money are able to use the funds. We are
working together with these provinces. We have dispatched and intend to
continue dispatching teams to ensure that that which we have allocated to
them is used by the end of the year.

The hon member also wants to know, finally, whether we have taken any steps
to assist those provinces that have failed to spend their allocations. Yes,
we haven’t taken the ultimate step. We didn’t want to throttle some
officials. What we have done is that we have written to the Premiers to
urge them to consider directing the necessary expertise and capacity to
those departments that might be very much in need of their support, and we
are restructuring the department to ensure that we can send personnel to
assist those provinces that have had problems.

I need to say at this particular point that the province that did have the
most severe problem was the Eastern Cape. As the member well knows, the
Eastern Cape is one of those provinces that have responded to our request
to separate the responsibilities of housing from those of local government
and, therefore, they were in the process of restructuring and were unable
to utilise the entirety of the money which was allocated to them, which is
R1,052 billion for this financial year.

Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Chief Whip and your cellular phone, would
you please leave us?

Mr A C STEYN: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Hon Minister, I think the
fact that funds can be taken away at such a late stage in the financial
year underscores your earlier answer that it is not aligned to budgets.
However, I would have thought that the same argument can be used about the
recipient provinces, that they also don’t have the aligned projects for the
budget.

What comes to mind, for example, is that in last weekend’s Sunday paper, in
the Scopa hearing, Gauteng was rapped over the knuckles for under-
expenditure of R34 million. But I think what was more important was the
R195 million that was used for an audit to determine who lives in the
previously built RDP houses.

It is, therefore, my concern that by transferring these large sums of money
to provinces at this late stage, it is either going to lead to dumping or
it is going to lead to inefficient spending. I think there is nobody in
this Chamber – individual or department – who would not love to get a
Christmas present like that, where you give him R200 million.

Now I would like to ask you, hon Minister, are you going to be able to ring-
fence the outcomes of the additional funds very particularly? Should you
perhaps have bitten the bullet and rather than get the very good record of
expenditure, return some of that money to Treasury?

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: No, no. There is no way I could have returned this
money to Treasury. We have a great need for housing, hon member. We have
indicated that the money that we have taken away from the Eastern Cape is
being utilised primarily for emergency housing – which means that this
money will be used for people who are living under very stressful
conditions, people who are living below flood lines and people who are
constantly plagued by fires at this particular time of the year.

There is no way that you can budget or plan for emergencies. So this is not
particularly in any of the plans that they would have had. We are using it
to ensure that, should we have the unfortunate situation where we have
shack fires or floods, we would have the necessary infrastructure to deal
very quickly with those people if we have not already removed them.

So we are working together with these provinces and we will be able to use
this money. It is not called ``dumping’’ in my language. I know we speak
two different languages. In my language it is said to be a clever re-
allocation of funds to ensure that we have maximum utilisation of money
that is allocated to us for a very vital responsibility that we have.

Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

Mr S J MASANGO: Madam Deputy Speaker. Hon Minister, I just want to know,
you are saying the money will be used for flooding or emergency, but should
there be no emergency, what are you going to do with it?

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Madam Deputy Speaker, I did not say the money will
be used for flooding. Why would you use money to flood people? [Laughter.]
He was not listening when I said that we would use that money for emergency
purposes because at this time of the year, with the inclement weather that
we have, there are people who live in areas that are prone to flooding.

Therefore, what we are going to do with this money in those provinces that
have these problems is to ensure that we can build temporary housing or
more solid housing in the short term to protect those people from the
hazards of this particular type of weather that we have at this particular
time of the year. But we would not use any money to flood people.

Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

Mkszn S N SIGCAU: Sekela Somlomo ndiyabulela, kwaye ndikwacela uxolo
Mphathiswa obekekileyo, ndicela ukubuza ukuba ingaba iphondo leMpuma Koloni
belinikwe imali engaphezulu kweemfuno zalo kusini na.

UMPHATHISWA WEZEZINDLU: Mandithi kobekekileyo uSigcawo hayi, iMpuma Koloni
inikwe imali ebesiyabele yona. Indlela esiyisebenzisayo kuhlahlo-lwabiwo
mali kukubala inani labantu abahlala kwelo phondo, siphinde sibale iqondo
lobuhlwempu kwelo phondo okanye i-poverty index gabula makhumsha.

Ngoko ke imali ebesiyinike iphondo leMpuma Koloni besicinga ukuba biza
kusetyenziswa nyaka, kodwa njengokuba bendisitsho, abakwazanga
ukuyisebenzisa kwade kwafika le mini sibone ngayo ukuba siyisuse le mali
kubo size siyinikezele kwamanye amaphondo, ngoba saye sabacela ukuba
bahlukanise uxanduva lwezeZindlu kweliya looRhulumente baseKhaya.

Bathe xa beyilungisa loo nto, bekwalungelanisa nephondo labo abakwazi
ukuyisebenzisa le mali ngale ndlela ibilindelekele ngayo. Siyithathile ke
le mali kodwa sikuthi siyibuyise xa begqibile ukulungelanisa, ngoba
ndiyaqonda ukuba wena lungu elihloniphekileyo, ukuba eyona nto uyikhalelayo
yile mali yakowenu. Sisayigcinile ke siyakuphinda siyibuyise xa sele sibona
ukuba nizakukwazi ukuyisebenzisa le mali. Enkosi. (Translation of isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms S N SIGCAU: Thank you, hon Speaker, and in the same vein, I would like
to apologise for this question. Did the Eastern Cape province receive a
budget allocation exceeding their provincial needs?

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Let me say to the hon Sigcau: No, the Eastern Cape
province got their correct budget allocation.  When we allocate money, we
first look at the population size, and poverty levels through the checking
of the poverty index in that province.

We were convinced that the money we had allocated for the Eastern Cape
would be expended during the same financial year, only to realise when the
end of the financial year got nearer that that money would have to be
rolled back in order for us to re-allocate it to other provinces that need
it most, and we went further to encourage them to separate Housing from
Local Government.

Therefore, they cannot use that money until they sort out the problems in
and around their province. We have since rolled back that money and will
only re-allocate it after they have resolved their problems. As we are all
aware, the hon member is more worried about the money that belongs to her
province. As I have already said, that money will be made available once
you have sorted out your problems. I thank you.]

Mr A C STEYN: Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to finish my earlier question.
What I wanted to ask the hon Minister is: Should we not, rather than taking
the risk of having the money used inefficiently - I think my colleague
wanted to know what if there is no emergency then the money will not be
used - consider returning it to Treasury for another purpose? What comes to
mind is what was said in this Chamber this afternoon – investment in our
students for bursaries. I was going to suggest building libraries in the
Eastern Cape but it appears they can’t do that either.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish I had the power to
recommend to the Chief Whips of their parties which member to remove from
the portfolio committee because quite clearly, the member is more committed
to education than he is to housing. [Laughter.] He knows very well the dire
need we have for funding in housing.

The fact that this money has been not used right now does not mean that
other provinces do not need the money. We, unfortunately had to follow a
particular process outlined by the law - the Dora process - and that is the
money that was allocated to the Eastern Cape. Unfortunately, because they
were restructuring, they could not use it this year. But it does not mean
that we cannot use it.

We might not have an emergency in this country but there are people who are
living under very stressful situations. Would it not, therefore, be better
that we remove them from those stressful situations in the unlikely event
that there might be a hazard?

If there are no floods then we will be very happy. But if the floods do
occur we will then have the necessary means to remove them and put them in
conditions that are the kind of conditions we would like our people to live
in. But, touch wood, we will not have floods. Why not plan for them in case
they do happen? Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

 Investigation, initiatives and savings in relation to social security fraud

480.  Mr T M Masutha (ANC) asked the Minister of Social Development:
      What (a) has been the outcome of the investigation into social
      security fraud, (b) initiatives are being taken to deal with social
      security fraud and (c) has been the total amount in savings resulting
      from such initiatives with regard to social security fraud?
                                                   NO2929E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Deputy Speaker, the reply is
that the Department of Social Development entered into an agreement with
the Special Investigating Unit to conduct fraud investigations and
prosecute grant frauds. A total of 5 656 people were taken through the
courts as at the end of September 2007 and 4 515 were convicted.

The reply to the (b) part of the question is: The South African Social
Security Agency, Sassa, is implementing a number of initiatives which range
from improving the grant administration process to fraud detection and
prevention mechanisms to address social security fraud. The initiatives
include, among other things, the use of biometrics, which allow for single
user access to the Social Security Sopen system.

This allows Sassa to accurately know who accessed the system, where and
when, and do regular data matching between Sopen and various sources of
data, for example the Persal and UIF systems. The exercise is conducted
regularly to identify exceptions which are investigated for validity and
eligibility. Sassa is also strengthening its human resource and vetting
processes to ensure that dishonest people are not appointed or are
identified and dealt with accordingly.

The reply to the (c) part of the question is: 12 591 acknowledgements of
debt valued at R69 million were signed as at October 2007. A further
preventative saving estimated at R690 million, which relates to grants that
would have been paid should the grant not have been terminated, was
realised. Thank you.

Mr T M MASUTHA: Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you, Deputy Minister for that
reply. In fact we had, as the portfolio committee, an interaction this
morning with Sassa and we had our guns blazing because of the negative
report from the Auditor-General relating to an amount of R40 million but we
were pleased to note that out of that R40 million only R600 000 could be
related to fraud and the balance of the money was actually utilised for the
legitimate functions of Sassa. I am satisfied with the further response
from the Deputy Minister so I will not ask a follow-up question. Thank you.

Ms H WEBER: Chairperson, thank you very much. Hon Deputy Minister, could
you perhaps tell me if any of the people who have been accused of fraud
were actually employed at the Social Security Agency and whether any of
them were previously employed by social development before the Social
Security Agency was formed? Thank you.
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: I am afraid that I don’t have
the data that is being asked for in front of me but in terms of grade 3
offenders in Gauteng there were eight people from the Department of Social
Development; in Mpumalanga there were three people from social services;
there was one in the Western Cape from social services and from all the
other departments there are people who are offenders. Whether they were
employed by Sassa, subsequently, I am sorry that is a new question. Thank
you, Deputy Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I was also just about to say that Ministers are not
compelled to answer questions that are not related to the initial question
and that are not based on the question that had been asked and this is one
such a question.

Ms J A SEMPLE: Chairperson, I would like to ask a follow-up question
regarding the reasons for the discrepancy between the number of public
servants who were found guilty of receiving grants fraudulently and those
who have actually signed the acknowledgement of debt. Just to help the hon
Deputy Minister, this was Question 465, which we’re not going to get to
today, so I am sure you have the answer there. Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Are we asking Question 465 now
as a follow-up question, Deputy Speaker?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: We are not asking Question 465. We are still on
Question 480 and I just made a ruling earlier on that the Ministers are not
compelled to answer anything that is not related to the initial question.
If the hon member still wants, and I think the hon member should get a
response to Question 465, given the fact that this is our last question
time this year with this cluster, it can go to the member as a written
response. Agreed? Thanks.

It looks like there is no other question related to Question 480. I would
just like to make mention of the fact that the two hours allocated for
normal question time have expired. We will now proceed to take questions
outstanding from 24 October 2007 for an hour, which, if you remember, we
promised the House that we would make sure that we did before we adjourn
this year.

           QUESTIONS STANDING OVER FROM WEDNESDAY, 24 OCTOBER 2007
                                  Cluster 2

               Proposals for improvement of teachers’ salaries

356.  Mr R P Z Van den Heever (ANC) asked the Minister of Education:

      Whether her department has formulated any proposals for the
      improvement of teachers’ salaries following the recent public sector
      strike; if not, why not; if so, what proposals?    NO2490E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker, the reply to this question
is as follows: Yes, the department has formulated proposals for improved
remuneration of educators. The proposals are available on the website of
the Department of Education in far greater detail than I would be allowed
by Madam Deputy Speaker to refer to in this particular sitting. So I would
ask the hon members to look at the website.

We have put forward a revised proposal just this week to the Education
Labour Relations Council, given the objections to the original proposal
from two of the unions represented in the Chamber and that set of proposals
will also be placed on the website shortly.

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Thank you, Minister. Some of the queries that have
been raised, and this may be covered by the revised response that you have
talked about, is that in terms of higher salaries on the basis of higher
qualifications, it would take teachers very long to reach their maximum. In
fact, it was said that it would take teachers up to 18 years to move to the
maximum of the salaries if they go on the basis of a higher salary for
higher qualifications.

One of the concerns that has also been mentioned is that, as far as the
occupation-specific dispensation is concerned, these are based on learner
performance and teachers who are at poorly performing schools, which are
the historically disadvantaged schools, will suffer, and teachers at better
performing schools will flourish. Given the explanation which the Minister
has given that there are revised proposals in the pipeline, I wonder if the
Minister would want to venture a comment on that?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Firstly, Madam Deputy Speaker, the complaint had
been that it would take 54 years to reach the end of the notches on the
upper end of the salaries that have been proposed. Now we have replied that
the calculation is wrong; it would have taken 18 years.

However, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have to add that given that end scale for
that level of teacher is R364 000, as proposed currently, by the end of
next year that R364 000 will have changed, given annual increments that are
paid anyway so that in 18 years the R364 000 could very well be R1 000 000
given the additions one has to work on. So the notion that you will get to
R360 000 in 18 years is actually quite mistaken and I wish we could do
better calculations.

I believe the proposal that has been put forward is a fair one with respect
to the link to performance. In any system where you remunerate on a basis
where you have performance awards which we have in our system with respect
to the evaluation of teachers where you get a percentage addition each year
as an extra added on to your annual payment, depending on performance
through the evaluation, ensuring that you also look at the performance of
learners is vitally important because you are in school as a child in order
for you to do well through the teaching. And if we have children who are
failing in the system and we continue to reward teachers, I do not think
that would be a good policy. So I think having learner performance as one
of the criteria, not the only one that you would look at, is something that
we should not really give up.

Mr G G BOINAMO: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. On the basis of the
confusion, frustration and anger she has caused by making a false
announcement on increases in teachers’ salaries, will the Minister accept
the SA Democratic Teachers Union’s proposal for an immediate 4,5% general
salary increase, if not, why not and if so what are the relevant details
and does she expect to produce good results across all grades when she
makes the best teachers, who produce excellent results, wait for 19 and 28
years respectively before they earn a monthly salary of R22 000?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Again, with respect to the last part of the
member’s question, I just ask you to do the calculations. Hon Boinamo, you
began in this Parliament earning a particular salary. If you looked at how
you will get to the last set of notches in the parliamentary salary, you
might have said it will take me so many years to get to R640 000, whatever
it is – I don’t know what it is - you cannot, if you get increases of 7%,
5%, 6% each year, have those salaries remain static in terms of your
understanding of what will occur in 10 years’ time.

I don’t know what more to say. It’s actually quite worrying that those who
are teaching our children can’t work out that salary levels – the top or
the bottom - change every year because we have increments every year. So I
am a bit puzzled by this notion that it takes 18 years to get to the
current salary offer that we have put forward.

With respect to the first remark, I take offence at the implication that I
have misled teachers. I certainly have not!

With respect to the matter of whether we will do something to respond by
offering an increment of 4,5% across the board, my answer to you is the one
I have given to the unions when we met, which is that there is no agreement
in the resolutions signed by the majority of unions when the agreement was
reached that there would be an across-the-board percentage increase over
and above the 7,5% that was the settlement this year.

The agreement that was signed indicates that various departments that
employ professionals in the Public Service should work out an occupational
specific dispensation. That is what I have done. I have acted on the basis
of the agreement. The offer that I have put out there adheres to the
principles enunciated in the agreement and I believe that it is a fair one.


There are aspects of the issues that have been raised about the levels and
the large number of steps within a notch and so on. That, I think, is
reasonable to look at and some of that we are prepared to adjust. But as to
an across-the-board increase, hon member, the direct answer is no, there
will not be such increase.

Mnu A M MPONTSHANE: Phini likaSomlomo, ngicela usheshe ungikhuze uma
mhlawumbe lokhu engizokubuza kungasahambelani nemibuzo ebuziwe. Bengicela
ukubuza kumhlonishwa ukuthi ngabe isimo sesikuphi, uma kwenzekile ukuthi
usuyitholile imibiko eqhamuka ezifundazweni, mayelana nezikhalo zothisha
ezihambisana nesiteleka samaholo ekade sikhona. Abanye othisha bakhala
ngokuthi bathathelwa izimali zabo kodwa bengayanga esitelekeni. Sesinjani
isimo manje ezifundazweni uma uNgqongqoshe eseyitholile imibiko?
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Deputy Speaker, I would like you to correct me if what
I’m going to ask does not correspond with the questions that have been
asked. I would like to ask the hon Minister about the situation now with
regard to the teachers’ salary strike that took place recently, if she has
already received any reports from provinces. Some teachers are complaining
that there were deductions from their salaries even though they did not
participate in the strike. How is the situation now in each province if the
Minister has received the reports?]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker, we are in constant liaison
with my colleagues in the provinces to assist them where we can with
ensuring that no teacher has deductions made from their salary unfairly. We
had a fairly significant number of teachers writing to us with respect to
KwaZulu-Natal and I believe that matter has been resolved. We had
deliberations with the head of education as well as the MECs. We do
intervene where we can.

The problem, however, arises from the fact that the steps we had agreed to
were not followed at all schools. Registers were not kept; people would not
sign in when they were at work, and so on. Also, some of the systems of the
provinces, I think, have failed us, but we are striving hard to ensure that
no teacher is disadvantaged by virtue of the implementation of the no-work-
no-pay rule.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I beg your pardon? Well, I don’t think you are
allowed to do what you are doing. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon Minister. The hon member is definitely
out of order.

Hon Boinamo, there are no more slots for follow-up questions. Not even that
one.

Question 350 to stand over.

  Plans with regard to desegregation of residences at the University of the
                                 Free State

353.  Mr B G Mosala (ANC) asked the Minister of Education:

      (1)   Whether the Council of the University of the Free State has
          informed her department of its plans to desegregate residences in
          2008; if so, what are the relevant details;

      (2)   whether her department plans to assist the university to
          implement this decision; if not, why not; if so, what are the
          relevant details?                                         NO2487E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker, I wonder if someone could
give me the Question Paper with all these questions. I’m a bit
disadvantaged in the sense of not having them, but ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: We could just ask him to repeat the question.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: No, I’ve got the question in front of me and I
can reply, but I’m saying if there are any more for me I’d ...
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: This is the last one.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: All right, well ...

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, it would be a pleasure for us to give
her a copy of the Question Paper.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: No, thank you, not from you!

Mr M J ELLIS: Are you sure?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Yes, absolutely.

Mr M J ELLIS: Awww!

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, you are out of order! Sit down!

Hon Minister, please address us.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: He’s very disorderly, but he’s being helpful
today!

In reply to paragraph 1, yes, I have been informed by the university of
their plans to desegregate residences from January 2008. However, the
council, on writing to me, did not provide me with a copy of the revised
policy.
With regard to whether we plan to assist with the implementation, all I can
say, hon member, in reply is that I’m pleased that the council of the
university has taken the very progressive decision to desegregate
residences in 2008. I think it’s shocking in our country that we still have
segregated residences at any university after 13 years of democracy, and
I’m looking forward to the successful implementation of the decision of the
council.

Given the challenges associated with this very important policy
development, I have asked my department to be ready to assist the
university if and when necessary.

Mr B G MOSALA: Thank you very much for this kind of response, Minister. We
are very grateful that your department has taken up this matter with the
university. Hopefully a copy of the revised hostel placement policy will be
forwarded to your office soon. We are also hoping that the university
council will be fully co-operative and positive, especially in view of
their commitment to increase diversity in their university residences.
Thank you very much, Minister, I do not have a follow-up question.

Mev D VAN DER WALT: Agb Adjunkspeaker, dankie vir die geleentheid.
Minister, ek kan nie anders nie as om my te verstout deur te sê die VF Plus
het hierdie ding by die universiteit gedryf en nou is hulle glad nie hier
nie en hulle het selfs hulle hofsaak teruggetrek. Kyk nou maar net!
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek noem hulle nou die “VF Minus”! [Applous.]

Ek dink natuurlik daar is baie studente wat hulle studies wil maak werk,
omdat hulle wil klaar afstudeer en natuurlik omdat dit vandag baie duur is
om te studeer. Gegewe die konflik in 1997 op hierdie universiteit se kampus
as gevolg van sogenoemde gedwonge integrasie, kan ek u vra of u enige
maatreëls in plek het ingeval daar vroeg volgende jaar weer sulke konflik
deur die ekstremiste geskep gaan word? Baie dankie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs D VAN DER WALT: Hon Deputy Speaker,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity.
Minister, I cannot but make bold to say that the FF  Plus  has  driven  this
matter at the university, and now they are not even present here today,  and
they have even withdrawn their court case. Imagine that! [Interjections.]  I
shall now call them the “FF Minus”! [Applause.]

Of course, I believe there  are  many  students  who  will  want  to  ensure
success in their studies, because they want to complete their  studies  and,
of course, since it is very expensive to study nowadays. Given the  conflict
on the campus of this university  in  1997  which  resulted  from  so-called
forced integration, may I ask you whether you have any measures in place  in
case similar conflict is again instigated by  extremists  early  next  year?
Thank you very much.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: As I’ve indicated, we are in touch with the
council, with Prof Fourie, the vice-chancellor, with the various
stakeholders in the institution and being aware that there are elements
that are resistant and racist, we have of course alerted my department to
also speak to departments such as Safety and Security so that, if
necessary, we would provide support.

Could I ask that we don’t use the term “forced desegregation”, because our
Constitution, which we all support, says we should not be segregated in the
way that the institution has had its residences. Therefore, I think all of
us as political parties need to loudly acclaim the decision taken by the
council and support them in executing the decision.

I’m not surprised that the FF Plus is not here because the resolve of the
people of South Africa is that we would be a nonracial society and the FF
Plus is not supported in its resolve that it cannot work with that kind of
principle and objective. But those of us gathered here, will do so and
ensure that we support our universities to reflect the ethos elaborated in
our Constitution.

Mr G G BOINAMO: Thank you, Madam.

O ntseetse mafoko, Tona. Legale ke tla tswelela ka potso ya me. [Minister,
you said what I intended to say. Nonetheless, I will still ask the
question.]
The segregated students’ residences at the University of the Free State are
clearly in conflict with the creation of a nonracial society which is
enshrined in the Constitution of the country. Is the Minister intending to
hold the council of the University of the Free State to account for having
allowed this unacceptable situation to exist for such a long time? If not,
why not? If so, what are the relevant details? Thanks.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: There is no provision which allows me to hold
the council to account. What would perhaps have been an action taken within
the institution or by parents would have been a class action against the
practice of segregation. I think it has been young people who have fought
against the segregation very vigorously and have been supported by various
members of the executive and academic staff of the university who had the
resolve that that situation had to change.

It is sad that there continue to be elements in our country that are
supportive of such segregation on racial terms and fail to realise that the
young people of our country have to be the root of the future South Africa
which is united and nonracial, and I think this important step is a
contribution to ensuring that young people in South Africa do become that
root that gives life to a strong branch of a united, nonracial and
nonsexist South Africa.

I urge all of us to support the university and to object in newspapers that
seem to allow debate that is anti such a step to rage in their papers. With
us the progressives are tending to be very silent on these matters. So I
think, let us speak out loudly in support of ensuring that all our
institutions respect the Bill of Rights in our Constitution and that they
contribute to building a nonracial South Africa.

 Position regarding the nomination of a certain person for a position on the
                                 SABC Board

360.  Ms M Smuts (DA) asked the Minister in the Presidency:

      (1)   whether his Chief Director for Ministerial Services (name
            furnished) asked a certain person (name furnished) for her
            permission and her curriculum vitae on nominating her for a
            position on the SA Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Board; if
            not, what is the position in this regard; if so,


      (2)   whether his Chief Director advised the said person that he is
            working for the Minister in the Presidency; if not, why not?
                                                                    NO2496E

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Deputy Speaker, the reply is as follows:
The Chief Director in the Presidency contacted the office of the said
person and requested a curriculum vitae and a letter of acceptance for the
purpose of making a nomination to the SABC Board. With regard to question
No 2, the answer is no.

Ms M SMUTS: Deputy Speaker, does the hon Minister in the Presidency not
mislead us by omission by not answering the last part of my question to
him? The second part of the question to the Minister was whether his Chief
Director had advised Ms Serobe that he was working for the Ministry in the
Presidency, to which he answered “no”.

The last part was: If not, why not? I am looking for an answer there
because we have in the interim, since the Minister was missing from the
House - and may I say how much better it is when he is with us and for the
whole afternoon – received this remarkable letter from Ms Serobe to the
Speaker in which she says: “I was contacted telephonically by Mr Louis du
Plooy of the Office of the Presidency asking whether I would agree to a
nomination. Had the chairman of our committee asked me if I know Mr Louis
du Plooy of the Office of the Presidency, I would have confirmed “yes”, as
I had no need to conceal the fact.”

For all I know, the answer to the question whether he had advised Ms Serobe
that he was working for the Office of the Presidency, may be no because she
already knows him. However, you have not, sir, answered the question “if
not, why not?” Until we hear a satisfactory explanation, I would like to
suggest, with respect, that that is misleading by omission.

The second thing I would like to ask, Mr Chair ...

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order, hon member! The time for
your first opportunity to ask a follow-up question has expired.

Ms M SMUTS: Thank you. I think that’s a sufficiently serious one.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): You might have an opportunity to
ask a further supplementary question.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, if she wants to know, “if not,
why not?”, I do not know. He didn’t tell her. What do you want to know? You
stand here and make accusations about misleading by omission. What is
misleading? You asked the question and I have answered the question. If you
think I am misleading you, you must go and take whatever action you think
you must take. The answer is no! The answer to the question “if not, why
not?” remains “no”, because he did not think - and I don’t know why - that
he should inform her who he was. What else do you want?

Mr R D PIETERSE: Chairperson, hon Minister, the Act allows any person or
any South African to nominate any suitable person to be considered for the
SABC Board. Does the Minister know of any person that might be prohibited
from doing so, or should we ignore the last part of Ms Smut’s question as
just pure politicking?

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Thank you very much because that has
anticipated what I think she wanted to add. Let me say this: Every South
African who is an adult has a right to nominate anybody to serve on the
board. That South African need not necessarily get the permission of his or
her employer.

So, even you, Ms Smuts, if you want to nominate somebody, have the right to
do so without asking your employer, that is the DA. So, Mr Pieterse, yes, I
agree with you that an individual has the right to nominate somebody and
that an individual has nominated a person to the board and he did not hide
the fact that it was he who was doing the nominating.

Ms S C VOS: Sorry, Chair, I don’t know where Mr Biyela is, so I will ask my
question.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Please go ahead, Ms Vos.

Ms S C VOS: Thank you, Chairperson. Minister, in fact, the person said
openly in letters that she was advised by the Chief Director that he was
working for the Ministry. But be that as it may, I concede that, as you
say, every citizen has rights and can nominate whomsoever he or she wishes
to nominate, by right, to various statutory bodies, and that there is a
constitutional separation of powers, clearly, between the executive and the
legislature.

Are you now saying that it is the view of The Presidency that it is
appropriate for senior employees to nominate prospective candidates to
statutory bodies who, thereafter, are approved by The Presidency – the
employer - either by stealth or openly? Thank you.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Really, Ms Vos, you know what? I really
expected something better from you. First of all, the question is “Whether
the Chief Director advised the said person that he was working for the
Ministry in the Presidency?” The answer is “no”. The follow-up was: “If
not, why not?” I said that I do not know, but the answer is no, he did not
advise her of that but he did ask for a CV. That is the question.
[Interjections.]

No, no, I can understand you. But you see, if you don’t understand that in
a democratic society any individual has a right to nominate - but maybe not
in your party; maybe not in this independent kingdom of Zululand that your
party might want, but at least, in the democratic South Africa ...
[Interjections.]

Sit down! You‘ve been talking too much today. So, Ms Vos, with respect to
this particular question, that is the answer. Whether or not Ms Serobe may
or may not have made a statement in the press, that is not what I am
answering today. So if you want to ask Ms Serobe, you go and ask her. I’m
not here to answer on behalf of Ms Serobe; I’m here to answer for myself.

Furthermore, I must emphasise again and again and again, that anybody
employed in the Public Service has a right to nominate any person to the
board without having to seek the permission of the employer. It would be
ridiculous if an employee in the Public Service had to request the
permission of that employer to nominate somebody to the board. So the
answer to that question is that that person has a right to nominate, and
I’m answering the question according to the way it was asked.

Ms M SMUTS: Chairperson, the hon Minister in the Presidency cannot come
here and say to me that he does not know. You may not, sir, because you are
the Minister and the political head. We work here under the doctrine of
ministerial responsibility. We don’t call in public servants. You are the
political head. That is the system under which we function. You are
accountable to us. You may not come here and tell me that you don’t know,
in reply to the said part of the question.

You have, by the way - on record now - the flatly conflicting accounts of
yourself on behalf of Mr Du Plooy and Ms Serobe. That is the problem in
itself. I would like you to answer this because this is a dangerous
tendency. Do you accept ... [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order! Order! Order, hon Ms Smuts!
Minister, could you take your seat, please? Hon Smuts, you are running out
of time. Could you ask the question?
Ms M SMUTS: Under the doctrine we follow, what your public servants do, you
do. What Mr Du Plooy has done, you have done. That is your department; you
have to account for them. And in this case, it is the very Presidency which
is the appointing body that has intervened in the nomination. It is
unacceptable. [Time expired.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: You know, Chairperson, this is just getting
ridiculous. With regard to the part of the question that goes: “If not, why
not?”, I said that I cannot answer why Mr Du Plooy, who happens to be the
Chief Director in my office, nominated somebody and didn’t do something
about it. I can’t reply on his behalf, nor am I going to take lessons ...
[Interjections.]

Ms H WEBER: Chairperson, on a point of order: These questions went out
prior to the answering session today. The Minister should then have asked
that employee why before he came to answer.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, that is precisely the point
I’m making: I don’t think we must ever get into a situation in this country
in which a Minister would think that if an employee in his or her employ
has nominated somebody to the board, that employee must then be accountable
to him or her. I think that is wrong and antidemocratic. I’m very surprised
that the DA would have to take a position that smacks of antidemocratic
tendencies.

Further, I do not want to be taught a lesson by Ms Smuts about the
separation of powers, nor do I want to be taught a lesson by her about my
responsibilities to this House. My responsibility to the House is to answer
this question, which I believe I have answered well enough.

Out of respect for her, I actually even gave her a written answer before I
came here because I was unable to come to the House earlier, and she knows
that. She had a written answer that I had submitted, which I’m repeating.
This is the answer I am giving to the House, an answer to the question she
had posed. If she is not satisfied with the answer, there is nothing I can
do about it. I can only answer the question in the best way I think
possible. If she is dissatisfied, hard luck!

 Tools being used in Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Forestry Charter
                 to ensure benefits for women and the youth

379.  Ms T E Lishivha (ANC) asked the Minister of Water Affairs and
      Forestry:

      What tools are being used in the Broad-Based Black Economic
      Empowerment Forestry Charter to ensure that women and the youth obtain
      benefits for meaningful and sustainable entry into forestry?
                                                         NO2517E

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Thank you, hon Chairperson, and
hon member for the question. The reply is as follows: The Broad-Based Black
Economic Empowerment Charter for the forestry sector that was launched
earlier this year, aims to ensure that we continue to grow the forestry
sector and that it remains a globally competitive industry whilst we ensure
that there is broad-based BEE and transformation of the sector.

The vision presented in the charter is that of an inclusive and equitable
forestry sector in which black women and men fully participate; a forestry
sector that is characterised by sustainable use of resources, sustainable
growth, international competitiveness and profitability for all its
participants; a forestry sector that contributes meaningfully to poverty
eradication, job creation, rural development and economic value-adding
activities.

To develop the Forestry Sector Charter, the steering committee comprising
of representatives from all sections of the industry was established. This
committee, in their deliberations and consultations, recognised that if the
charter were to be truly broad-based, then women would need specific
measures to facilitate participation in the sector.

If you look at the charter itself, the seven indicators of the charter
scorecard have taken this need into consideration, and women’s
participation is included in all the elements of the scorecard, the
implication of which is that women should form part of the empowerment
deals, benefit from skills development, management opportunities and
employment equity as well as procurement and enterprise development. Both
government and industry, therefore, have a responsibility to ensure the
participation and benefit of women in all aspects of the charter.

In fact, if you look at the sector targets themselves, the sector has
committed itself to attaining greater gender parity in ownership of
forestry enterprises and targeted 10% of ownership by black women in
existing enterprises. For medium and large enterprises, a bonus point
incentive has been included to further increase this target to 15%. Special
attention will also be given by industry and government to enterprise
development support, as I’ve said, for women in the forestry sector.

My department, over and above this, has taken a number of initiatives to
build the capacity of women in the sector, including training of women on
forestry legislation, compliance and participatory forestry management. We
have also been providing support on some of the non-forestry areas like
training women and have supported them in beekeeping activities and
development and management of nurseries for trees. They’ve also been
trained in greening, pole processing and charcoal making, which are
economic opportunities associated with the forestry sector. Over and above
that, eight female students have also been allocated bursaries by my
department this year – 2007 - while pursuing their forestry academic
qualifications. [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order! Hon Minister, your first
allocation of time has expired.

Ms P BHENGU: Thank you, Chairperson and hon Minister, for the informative
response. Hon Minister, I would like to ask whether the Minister has
considered that the women and youth should start co-operatives as a way of
involving themselves in this broad-based BEE so as to benefit and have
sustainable jobs? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Yes, we have actually
considered that. Let me say that the process to finalise a charter has been
completed and the report has to be published in the Gazette. If you look at
the charter implementation plan, one of the agreements is for the
department to establish an implementation unit that will assist with
driving certain aspects of the charter, one of which is what the hon member
is asking about, enterprise development, supporting the small and medium
enterprises that will develop out of this, as well as support to co-
operatives or community trusts. The form of the enterprise to be supported
will obviously be dependent on the needs of the community.

As far as the youth is concerned, the department has identified existing
youth projects in forestry and these will be used to provide baseline
information with regard to the skills needs of the youth. And we’ve done a
few other things just to work with the youth at schools and the public
broadcaster, and we have started the process to establish a Youth in
Forestry Award.

Mr M M SWATHE: Thank you, Chairperson and Minister. Can the Minister tell
us whether her department has prepared a viable working capital and trained
more women and youth to take up challenging tasks and positions in the
mainstream forestry industry to create more jobs for the poor unemployed?

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Thank you, hon member, for the
question. One of the major challenges that has been identified by the
charter is skills shortages, especially within our black communities. In
response to this, my department together with the Forest Industries
Education and Training Authority – FIEATA - will be hosting skills
workshops in November and December this year. In these workshops, skills
needs and gaps are being identified in relation to how women and youth as
well as the disabled can be skilled to benefit from the charter.

We are also working with the industry to ensure that training and skills
development are aligned with the sector requirements and thus placing
people in a position to compete for tenders and other job opportunities in
the sector. Funds have been set aside by FIEATA to ensure that training can
commence immediately.

In addition to skills development and training, the charter encourages the
industry to support small business enterprises through preferential
procurement and enterprise development and the indicators that are on the
scorecard.

During the implementation phase, the charter council will monitor the
industry’s performance regarding the support of small forestry enterprises
by means of mentorship, coaching and provisioning of opportunities to
ensure their sustainability.

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Hon Minister, having listened to your response and having
outlined your consideration with regard to the different parts in the value
chain - as forestry is now considered as quite a key sector in government’s
industrial policy - does the department consider that, maybe, we should
target specific areas in the value chain that would ensure that women will
remain in the sector or, in particular, in the economy? Will they consider
part of the value chain area such as beneficiation for women? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Thank you, hon member. The hon
member is correct that forestry makes a significant contribution to the
economy and it has been identified as one of those growth areas in terms of
Asgisa. The size and importance of forestry can be seen in the studies that
have been produced by Stats SA. Secondly, the contribution by the forestry
sector should also be seen in the value that it adds to our rural areas.
The hon member is also talking about beneficiation. We are indeed looking
at working together with the Department of Trade and Industry, where we’ve
developed a strategy on how we can beneficiate some of these, looking at
industries such as timber processing, furniture, pulp and paper.

With forestry being a rural activity, this has an enormous potential to
contribute to the development of the rural economy. Without a doubt, as we
look at these downstream industries, women are being considered and are
prepared to participate fully in the benefits.

Mr M W SIBUYANA: Hon Minister, we are aware of the fact that forests are
closer to rural areas and those people who reside in rural areas are
poverty stricken. Investment comes from the people who are outside the
rural areas. Are you in a position to tell us how the rural areas become
active participants in the industry?

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Well, the hon member is
correct. There is poverty amongst people residing in the rural areas, but
at the same time, these are the people who are extensively using the
forestry products for daily consumption and small-scale trade. They use
firewood. Over 80% of our rural households are using firewood as their
primary source of energy. Furthermore, it is also estimated that there are
300 000 traditional doctors who utilise forestry products.

The contribution, presently, of the forestry informal sector to livelihoods
in the second economy is estimated at between R10 billion and R14 billion.

What I’ve been saying, hon member, is that my predecessor, Minister
Sonjica, embarked on this process for the same reason that we want to
transform the sector and ensure that people who are in the rural areas,
where most of the forests are, anyway, become beneficiaries of these
forestry products. So, the Broad-Based Forestry Charter, every step of the
way, is targeting black people to come in on ownership – black people and
women to come in with regard to management to be beneficiaries of
enterprise development and to benefit right through the value chain. If you
look at most of what we’ve done, we have prepared them in terms of
workshops, consultations and setting up organisations for women in the
forestry area or sector. We are trying to prepare them.

So, what will happen is that licences are going to be issued. Regarding
companies that cannot show us that they’ve brought in black people and
black women according to the scorecard, the council that is going to be set
up is going to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the charter so
that where there is no compliance, we are also able to hold back the only
tool that we have in terms of regulating here.

Let me say to you that the challenge going forward is definitely in the
implementation of the charter. We have given an undertaking to ensure that
the charter will be implemented and that the industry and all other
stakeholders have signed the charter. So, I’m hoping that we will work
together. There might be teething problems, but we are going to ensure that
this industry is fundamentally transformed.

 Adequacy of amounts currently allocated to universities to meet demand for
                               skilled workers

372.  Mr G G Boinamo (DA) asked the Minister of Education:

      Whether, with regard to recent protests as a result of fee increases
      at a number of universities, the amounts currently allocated to
      universities are adequate to meet South Africa’s demand for skilled
      workers; if not, what steps are being taken to increase expenditure in
      this regard; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                  NO2509E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, I think there aren’t any members of
the executive who would ever feel that the allocations they get are
adequate. They always wish there could be more. However, a direct answer to
the question is as follows: We have increased the allocation to higher
education to R13,3 billion in the 2007-08 financial year. The R13,3 billion
is composed of three main items: block grants, student loans and merger
funds.
The largest item is R11,3 billion for block grants. This is an increase of
R1,08 billion, that is 10,6% higher than the allocation of 2006. The second
largest item is R1,3 billion for student loans, which is an increase of
R404,7 million over the 2006 amount, and part of this, R120 million, will
be used for teacher bursaries, and R100 million for Further Education and
Training college bursaries this year.

The last amount of the R13,3 billion is R600 million for university
mergers. By the end of next year, 2008, R3,1 billion will have been
allocated to mergers since the commencement of the restructuring process
with the National Plan for Higher Education in 2001.

Mr G G BOINAMO: Thank you, Chairperson. Minister, in light of the dire
shortage of skilled workers in South Africa, does the Minister have any
plans to provide free bursaries for skills training in order to meet South
Africa’s demand for skilled workers? If not, why not, if so, what plans are
in place?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: There are a range of devices available in the
state to support skills training. One of them arises from the National
Skills Fund, which derives its funding from the levies for skills training
that are funded through the Setas.

The other provision for skills is, of course, the R1,3 billion I’ve
referred to for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, which is a
massive support for access by poor, talented students to universities as
well as universities of technology.

A further addition is the amount I’ve referred to of R120 million for
talented students intending to teach the critical disciplines in our
education system, and thus to be in receipt of teacher bursaries, which
contract them to work for the state and not to have to repay any funds to
the state.

The fourth element consists of the first time ever funding for bursaries
for FET college study; R100 million this year and more to come from 2008.
All of these are contributing toward enhancing the skills profile of South
Africa and ensuring that young people who may be poor but have real talent
should not be denied the opportunity to become part of an expanded skills
pool for South Africa.

Position regarding use of V520 vaccine by HIV-negative women

352.  Mrs M M Madumise (ANC) asked the Minister of Health:

      What is the position of her department on HIV-negative women using the
      V520 vaccine in light of decisions in the United States of America and
      Australia to put the use of this vaccine for HIV-negative women on
      hold as it was reported that it was not preventing new infections?
                                  NO2474E
The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, thank you very much to the hon member
for the question. Let me start off by saying that I think it is now a known
fact that the Department of Health supports ethical research on the
prevention of HIV infection, including research on the development of an
effective vaccine. As you know, we are working with Saavi, the SA Aids
Vaccine Initiative. Contributing to that initiative are the Departments of
Health, and Science and Technology, as well as Telkom.

An HIV vaccine could be one of the interventions for the prevention of HIV
infections that could facilitate the reduction of such infections.
Therefore, in our view – and this is the position of the department -
halting of trials that are found to be ineffective is a good sign for us in
that it shows that there is good monitoring of such research. Of course,
you will recall that the participants in this research had received
vaccines. It is said that they were two to three times more susceptible to
being infected. Therefore, we think that halting the research was the
correct decision to take.

Of course, the South African government will continue to explore and
support the development of interventions that might help in the prevention
of HIV in our country.

Let me just remind hon members – and I think they know of this – that as
soon as we learnt of this halting of trials, particularly by the United
States and Australia, the Minister and the Department of Health convened
and held a meeting with the Medical Research Council, the SA Aids Vaccine
Initiative and the principal investigators. Obviously, we needed clarity so
that we could understand all issues around this initiative. This was
important for us because, as you know, the Department and the Ministry of
Health are responsible for the health and safety of the citizens of our
country.

So, when we were informed that the principal investigators had, in fact,
stopped the clinical trials, we endorsed that, because as I say, in our
view this indicated that we were monitoring research appropriately, in line
with all the guidelines that we have.

In this regard, therefore, all HIV vaccine trials are suspended until there
is clarity on the HVTN 503 trial. [Time expired.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Thank you, hon Minister. We’ll
give you a second allocation of time with the supplementary questions.

Mr A F MADELLA: Chairperson, Comrade Minister, as government and as the
country, we think that it is very important that we support all endeavours
to find a cure for this HI virus and Aids. However, we also understand that
certainly, ethical protocols are very important. As Minister, you also
referred to existing guidelines.

We would want to know whether the department has the necessary policies or
mechanisms in place to ensure that participants in important clinical
trials, such as this one, are fully briefed on the consequences before they
participate. When they participate, they should fully understand what they
are involving themselves in. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, thank you very much to the hon member
for this supplementary question. Let me just conclude the part that I was
trying to respond to, and then I’ll come back to your question, hon member.

I just wanted to say that obviously, there had been a breakdown in
communication between us and the principal researchers. However, we have
now agreed that before they go back to Seattle to make their final
presentation on the data that they are analysing, it would be necessary for
them to brief the Ministry and the department so that we are able to
communicate this message to the citizens of our country.

And, as I was saying, the department has indeed been informed that the
participants have been requested to stop using the investigational product,
namely the V520 and HVTN 503. Researchers in this context – and I’m coming
to the question that you asked - are expected to continue to monitor the
status of all participants, that is, those that were positive or negative
at the time the study was stopped.

Obviously, you will recall that we have guidelines that we put in place
particularly to ensure that the ethical norms and standards are met before
people are enrolled for these trials, so that they actually know what they
are in for.

Of course, when we had a meeting with the principal researchers, it became
clear that even the advisory committees that have been established to
monitor this process were not very strong. So, we’ve taken a decision that
we’d need to strengthen the advisory committees so that, indeed, the
participants know what they are in for.

So, once more, I’d like to say that, indeed, all vaccine trials are
suspended until there’s clarity on HVTN 503 trials. Thank you very much.

Mr M WATERS: Thank you, Chair. Hon Minister, you stated in your reply that
you won’t allow unsafe trials and that we should welcome the halting of
trials that were ineffective, as a sign of good monitoring with guidelines.

However, in 2005 a friend of yours, Dr Rath, set up two clinics in
Khayelitsha and was luring people infected with HIV with food parcels in
order to convince them to give up the antiretrovirals and take vitamin C
supplements instead, claiming that these would treat them for Aids
symptoms. At the time, three people were reported to have died as a result
of these trials.

In 2005, the DA submitted an application, in terms of the Promotion of
Access to Information Act, to the MCC, the Medical Control Council, for a
copy of its report into Dr Rath’s activities in Khayelitsha, a report that
was promised two years ago. Later in 2005, you reluctantly allowed the MCC
to investigate Dr Rath’s experiments.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order, hon member! You should ask
your question – you are running out of time.

Mr M WATERS: Are you not applying double standards when it comes to your
friends and to the safety of vulnerable South Africans? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I think it is Mr Waters who knows
about the clinical trials in Khayelitsha. I don’t know anything about
clinical trials in Khayelitsha and, therefore, am not in a position to
answer the question that he is asking. If he has concrete information that
he can put before me that indicates that I applied double standards, we
will use that information. However, I’m not going to work around gossip,
corridor talk and street talk that there are clinical trials taking place
when, in fact, I have not been given concrete information about these.

So, I don’t know anything about clinical trials in Khayelitsha. Therefore,
if he has the information, he’s still at liberty to come and give us that
information. I have no double standards. Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Did you manage to get the
question, Minister?

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Yes, I did, indeed, Chairperson. And may I say that
that is not a supplementary question to the question that was asked. Thank
you very much.

Mr G G BOINAMO: Thank you, Chairperson. I hereby give notice on behalf of
the DA that I shall move:

   That the House discusses the carnage which is gripping South African
   schools, where many learners continue to be murdered by their own peers.

   CONSIDERATION OF FOURTEENTH TO FORTY-FIRST REPORTS 14 TO 41 OF STANDING
                        COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS

Mr N T GODI: Chairperson, as we come to the end of our parliamentary
session this year, we want to place before the House the reports of the
committee as you indicated. These 28 reports come at the end of a year that
was one of the busiest, and I need to thank my colleagues and the staff of
the committee for their resilience and persistence.

The resolutions, as they appear, are about departments and entities that
have appeared before Scopa, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
These include the Department of Labour, the Department of Arts and Culture
and its entities, the Department of Sport and Recreation, the Department of
Justice and Constitutional Development, the Department of Health, the
Department of Defence, the Department of Education, the Department of Home
Affairs, the Department of Correctional Services, the Department of Water
Affairs and Forestry, the Diamond Board, the National Parks Board,
Government Printing Works, the Land Bank, as well as a number of Setas.

As we usually do in Scopa, we have identified areas of weakness. Concerning
financial management, we have recommended remedial actions. Most
importantly, we have put timeframes on comprehensive and truthful responses
to the recommendations, and on progress reports. It will be up to the
Speaker’s office, in relation to the last element, to track responses
within the timeframes that we have set.

The issues that we are dealing with, run like a common thread through
almost all the resolutions. They can be classified as arising from: one,
the control environment; two, the control activities; three, risk
management; and four, the leadership or monitoring role.

As we pass these resolutions, there can be no doubt that Parliament is
fulfilling its constitutional mandate in overseeing executive action. The
ball will be in the executive’s court to ensure compliance with best
practices in financial management and with legislation.

We want to commend these resolutions to the House. Thank you.

Mr D M GUMEDE: Chairperson, one of the basic tenets of our Constitution is
the principle of accountability in an open and transparent environment. In
relation to this, a lot of progress has been made in so far as legislation
and rules are concerned. We have developed plans and have implemented them.
However, a lot still needs to be done to attain the required standards.

Having considered the 28 reports that we are tabling today, at least 17 of
them are qualified. One has received an adverse opinion - that is, the
worst possible scenario on financial statements - and a number have a
disclaimer, which is not much better.

Definitely, we have to improve urgently on these. Where these continue,
immediate corrective action has to be taken for the good of our country.

The major root causes for these qualified audit opinions seem to be high
vacancy rates, high staff turnover, a lack of capacity or skills which may
or may not be as a result of the high vacancy rates, and ineffective audit
committees and internal audits.

These often result in a weakening of internal control and monitoring which,
in turn, has a telling impact on governance. As this cannot be allowed to
continue, we have to examine government and some departments so as to draw
up strategies for the attraction, retention and motivation of staff.

Our human resource management seems to need more targeted attention.
However, we are happy that - except for a very few instances - the problem
is not one of attitude. A lot of departments are really trying their best.
More and more accounting officers really take accountability for the
stewardship of public resources as a duty and as an obligation, rather than
as a burden. Indeed, adversarial attitudes towards accountability have
diminished.

Yes, sometimes it is tough to account timeously, but we should remember
that we are a winning nation. It has to be done, and we can do it.

Regarding specific reports, I believe that some of them deserve deeper
examination. For example, the SA National Defence Force has indeed
deteriorated, whilst other departments are improving. This department has
been qualified in 16 areas of its audit. It has significantly deteriorated
even as compared to the position that it occupied last year.

One of the major concerns is that the documents that are critical to the
promotion of previously disadvantaged soldiers have gone missing from their
files. This has been happening and has not been corrected for a number of
years. The impact of this is that people who were disadvantaged cannot
receive promotions even if those promotions are due.

Another area of concern is that of poor control of access to information
technology systems in the sensitive area of the Government Printing Works,
which deals with identity documents such as IDs, passports and birth
certificates. Indeed, we need much tighter access controls at the
Government Printing Works.

I shall not get into any report and will leave that to speakers that will
follow on me.

Lastly, the basic values and principles governing public administration, as
enshrined in our Constitution, are primarily the promotion of efficient,
economic and effective use of public resources.

Another important principle in public administration, amongst many, is that
of accountability. It should be accountable to the public because it uses
public funds. We are in government, but we are not using our own money.

The Public Finance Management Act, by and large, promotes these, and indeed
it is heartening that the Auditor-General has noted that, and I quote:
“National departments and other Public Finance Management Act organisations
have shown a steady improvement in submitting financial statements on time,
as required by the applicable legislation.” For this we congratulate our
Public Service.

In conclusion, yes, we have a problem, but what is inspiring is that more
and more departments are getting better. We thank the accounting officers
concerned. This will promote our integrity as well as public confidence in
the administration of our beautiful motherland and make us a winning
nation. Thank you very much, Chairperson.

Mr E W TRENT: Chair, it would be instructive for members to note the
details of the 28 reports that are being discussed here, today, as well as
Scopa’s recommendations. It is impossible to go through all these issues as
there are literally hundreds of issues that are raised.

However, to contribute to the improved effectiveness of Parliament as the
ultimate oversight institution over our public accounts, I would like to
focus my attention on the implications of the late processing of these
reports and on matters raised by the Auditor-General during his briefing on
the latest audit outcome report.

These 28 reports were all finalised by Scopa between 7 and 20 June 2007.
Yet they relate to the 2005-06 financial year. All require a response from
the relevant departments within 60 days from adoption. This means that if
these reports are in fact adopted this evening, the departments will be
required to respond to a report that has already been superseded, because
Scopa is currently dealing with the 2006-07 reports.

Scopa has already concluded hearings for 2007 with the following
departments: Health, which received its 5th qualified audit in six years -
and the hon Minister is gone now; Correctional Services, which received its
6th consecutive qualified audit; Justice and Constitutional Development,
which received its 4th qualified audit in six years; and Defence, which has
also received its 5th consecutive qualified audit in five years.

A hearing with the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, which received
its 5th qualification and worst audit opinion in the last six years, is
imminent. This means that Scopa’s hands have been effectively tied in
contributing to a year-on-year improvement in the financial management and
interaction with these serial offenders.

The Auditor-General is required to include in his report the departments’
responses to Scopa’s recommendations, but is unable to do so because they
are too late. In order to correct this situation, the cycle of oversight
must be run in such a way that it fits in and complements the cycle of
reporting as set out in the Public Finance Management Act.

I want to come to something more important, and I now turn my attention to
a very serious matter. The Auditor-General has expressed himself in no
uncertain terms as to the role of leadership at both executive and
administrative level in ensuring that sound management of our public
finance takes place.

If you look at his report, you will find that those departments that have
been successful have strong leadership at executive and political level.
So, you see, leadership is very important - and you can read that report
for yourself.

The advent of the Public Finance Management Act of 1999 was aimed at
changing the way that government departments were being run, by enabling
public sector managers to manage, but at the same time also be accountable.
They have to manage and they have to take responsibility for leadership
when they are in management.

The Public Finance Management Act goes further to say that government
departments and accounting officers must ensure that their departments have
and maintain effective, efficient and transparent systems of financial risk
management and internal control. Failure to do that is an offence in terms
of the Act, yet people are not acted upon.

In this respect, the Auditor-General has pointed out that the attitudes of
Ministers and managers towards the accounting processes are wanting in many
cases. There are two or three Ministers here this afternoon; they are not
interested in financial matters. Training sessions are often only attended
by junior staff members while members of the executive do not always ensure
that they are party to financial management decisions.

The DA notes that government is at long last starting to hold accounting
officers who are unsuccessful in addressing these matters, accountable and
we welcome that. The recent resignation of the Director-General of the
Department of Labour is a welcome example, and we hope that others will
follow that example.

However, we are still concerned that responsible Ministers appear to be
ignorant of what is going on in the offending departments and entities. An
example of this is the case of the former Minister for Agriculture and Land
Affairs, who did not know what was going on at the Land Bank. You have to
give leadership, if you want to manage.

In the three and a half years that I have served on Scopa in the National
Assembly, I cannot recall a single ministerial response to any Scopa
resolution, not even from one of our serial offenders. If I can be proved
wrong, then tell me which Minister has ever responded to a Scopa resolution
to this House. And they are accountable to this House.

Until this situation is rectified and the buck is made to stop with the
political leadership, we will not see significant improvement in the way we
spend taxpayers’ money and deliver services to the people. Thank you,
Chair.

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, the Scopa reports before this House yet again
bring into sharp focus the inability of the many state institutions to
comply fully with public finance laws and regulations. The Public Finance
Management Act was created specifically to improve state financial
administration. But now, some nine years after its creation, the law is
still not properly implemented and is perhaps not taken seriously enough by
accounting officers.

By way of example, Scopa reports also highlight lack of proper internal
controls, inappropriate accounting transactions, lack of performance audits
and weaknesses in financial administration.

I want to concentrate on the MAPPP Seta and the ISETT Seta. Both of these
received qualified audit opinions. The former paid out an amount of
R12 million to training institutions without supporting documents, raising
the possibility of fraud and corruption. Furthermore, certain discretionary
payments were made that were also susceptible to irregularities.

The MAPPP Seta also exceeded the threshold of administrative expenditure
allowed by law. Very concerning is the fact that the ISETT Seta paid out
performance bonuses, and that after having received two consecutive
disclaimers of audit opinions.

It is clear that financial management of these two Setas leaves much to be
desired, as is the case in large parts of the Seta system in general. I’m
sure Scopa will, in future, as in the past, be extremely vigilant about the
financial administration of these organisations.

Chairperson, the IFP wholeheartedly supports the various recommendations of
the committee. We hope that vigorous implementation of these
recommendations will improve the state of affairs at these institutions and
we assure them of our support and our vigilance in monitoring their future
performance.

We would also like to express our appreciation to the chairperson of the
committee, the hon Themba Godi, and our colleagues from all the parties for
their hard work and dedication to clean, accurate and proper public finance
management. Thank you.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Chairperson and hon members, there are, in these reports,
issues that are justifiable. Some cases are exceptions to otherwise
acceptable track records.

It should be noted that several issues are recurring themes throughout
these reports, and are illustrative of systemic challenges facing the
public sector. We need to acknowledge these problems and implement
corrective measures that will set new benchmarks for what the minimum
requirements are for the management of taxpayers’ money.

Firstly, lack of capacity and/or skills shortages hamper many of the
institutions and organisations dealt with in these reports. This is an
avoidable dilemma, and the resources are there to remedy it. Vacancies need
to be filled, capacity should be expanded through training and incompetence
should not be tolerated. It is not about rocket science; it is just about
basic management duties.

Secondly, on the topic of management, poor management and control over
financial resources and processes are another recurring theme and lead to
other issues that are seen throughout these reports such as insufficient
internal control, governance issues and failure to comply with the laws and
regulations. Again, the duties and requirements for public management are
not a mystery. There are manuals and laws that outline in detail what is
required of a public sector manager.

Widespread failure to respect the established legal and procedural
framework can eventually only be attributed to two things: It’s callousness
or incompetence at the highest levels. The line-function Ministers should
be asking whether or not they want to be associated with the poor
management that happened on their watch.

The UDM supports the recommendations made in the reports of the Standing
Committee on Public Accounts. [Applause.]

Ms N HLANGWANA: Hon Chairperson, the public hearings for the 2005-06
financial year for different departments in the public sector were
conducted by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.

The purpose of these public hearings is to hold officials of the various
departments accountable, and understand the complexities and challenges
that they encounter in performing their duties. There are predominantly
common weaknesses in most departments, which are lack of financial control,
and non-compliance with Treasury regulations and the Public Finance
Management Act.

The annual report of the Department of Home Affairs was noted, by the
Auditor-General, as qualified, and concerns were raised about the state of
financial affairs, and high vacancy and staff turnover rates, which are the
contributing factors to the present state of affairs in the department.
Therefore, Scopa recommended that the accounting officer urgently implement
adequate financial reporting systems. Also, the officer should develop
suitable policies and procedures to reach an acceptable level of maturity
regarding financial management.

Irregular expenditure was also identified as one of the challenges that
were not fully compliant in terms of section 1 of the Public Finance
Management Act. There was an expenditure of R19 million, which did not
comply with supply-chain management and Treasury regulations. There are
very clear recommendations that need to be adhered to.

In regard to the human resource factor, the department should take the
necessary steps to ensure that all funded posts are filled with
appropriately skilled personnel and that the retention policy is reviewed,
and it is hoped that the hon Minister will monitor the accounting officer
in regard to these recommendations.

The Department of Health also received a qualified audit report. There is
non-adherence to the Division of Revenue Act at both national and
provincial department level, which is a cause for concern. The other
discomforting factor is the lack of adherence to the supply-chain
management procedures and processes.

The Department of Correctional Services has acknowledged the weaknesses
identified by the Auditor-General and the recommendations are very clear
that within 60 days of the adoption of this report by the National
Assembly, the names of officials who were involved in the negotiations for
the public-private partnership contracts who have left the department and
subsequently taken directorship and leadership positions in the above-
mentioned asset procurement and operating partnership should be submitted
to Parliament in order to ascertain whether there were any irregularities
in the process.

In general, as stated at the beginning, there are key weaknesses in the
financial controls of most departments, and it is important that we have a
uniform accounting system practised by accounting officers. Lack of
adherence to legislation and procedures should result in disciplinary
action by the various departments.

As a committee, we would encourage other portfolio committees to interact
with us in order to consolidate the strengths and weaknesses of different
departments. This will promote a harmonious tackling of the financial
predicament of the public sector.

In conclusion, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts was established by
this House to ensure accountability, transparency and implementation of the
policies of the ANC, thereby ensuring a better life for all. Ndiyabulela.
Ke a leboga. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

Mr B E PULE: Hon Chairperson, departments and entities are always caught up
in the process of adaptation to an accountability chain. This is indeed a
real cause for concern.

The common denominator in accountability in departments is non-compliance
with accounting standards, and determination of the correct values of
disclosures in the financial statements in line with applicable accounting
practices as prescribed by National Treasury, the Public Finance Management
Act and other related legislation. There are internal control weaknesses,
non-existence of generally accepted and recognised accounting practices,
and, above all, lack of capacity and skills within departments.

The Standing Committee on Public Accounts is always worried by departments
claiming that there is a lack of capacity or skills when some of them have
these skills, in fact, to defraud government. Scopa is always told that
there are measures in place when those measures are never implemented.
Heads of departments do not seem to understand that they can only delegate
the responsibility and not the accountability, but, unfortunately, they
delegate both. It is high time that Scopa resolutions are taken seriously
by this House. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P A GERBER: Chairperson, it’s always a privilege to address this House.
As members of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, we don’t often get
the opportunity to address members from this podium. I see it as a
privilege, and I thank the ANC for that privilege. I am sorry, hon Mike
Ellis. I did not lose my voice, so you will have to stand me for another
five minutes.

In the 8 January statement by President Mbeki, he said, and I quote: “We
must do scrupulous monitoring ...” We have been trying very hard to do that
in this committee. Therefore, when you work with taxpayers’ money, there is
no way that you can ask too many questions.

I’d like to touch on one or two of the resolutions that you’ve got before
you, the one being the Land Bank. This once-proud institution with so many
historical successes has tragically been allowed to be derailed by certain
irresponsible officials. It’s a sad day for agriculture in South Africa
that such a backbone of the industry has been allowed to go to ruin. We
must not complain if we go to the shops and pay R100 a kilo for lamb chops
or R70 for a pocket of potatoes or R7 for a cabbage. For far too long,
agriculture has been used as a punch bag, and we as the ANC will not allow
this.

If you go and read the Hansard and the transcripts of Scopa hearings,
you’ll see that there have been many, many warnings about the Land Bank.
Yet, every time when an institution or a department gets into trouble, a
turn around strategy is announced. We’ve seen so many turnaround strategies
that we will become drunk by turning around. If you turnaround twice,
you’re still going in the same direction, so we will have to come up with
better plans.

Why do we allow something to first end up in intensive care before we
intervene? By then it’s too late, and the damage has been done. When we had
the hearing on the Land Bank, the chief financial officer and his second in
charge weren’t even there. This was five months ago. He was on stress
leave, apparently out of the country. We, therefore, welcome the steps that
the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs has taken to clean up the
house of the Land Bank. Congratulations, Minister.

In many cases, by just reading the annual reports and financial reports of
departments, many of those issues can be picked up there, but if you go to
the basement of this very Parliament - the rubbish dump down here - many of
the new annual reports, some still even covered in plastic, haven’t even
been opened, and they are thrown away. So, we in Scopa have to read more
than 300 annual reports a year, and I don’t think it’s too much for members
to at least read a couple of these reports.

If you do read them, then please read the financial information at the end
of the report, all that information written in small font. The most
important information in life is written in small font. You just have to
look at your bank statements, your insurance policies, your car insurance,
and the back of your receipt. It’s very important information.

Then I’d like to touch on the SA National Parks Board. We had a visit to
the Kruger National Park, and a hearing with SA National Parks was very
fruitful. One of the issues that we recommended in our resolution that we
got here this afternoon deals with the Skukuza Airport, and I would like to
read it to you. It reads:


  The committee noted the closure of the Skukuza Airport, and the financial
  loss that this has had on the park. The committee recommends that
  SANParks, together with the Minister, restarts the negotiations with the
  relevant role-players in that province to reopen this airport to restore
  the financial viability of regular scheduled flights as well as the icon
  status of the Kruger National Park, especially in the light of 2010.


I’d like to touch on the Ngonyama Trust Board. This trust has been a
complicated problem child for a long time, and it will still take a while
before it comes clean due to the complexities of the issues there. I’d like
to tell you that the landholdings have been a problem there. For instance,
there were huge differences between the hectares recorded in the land
register versus the hectares reflected on the title deeds. The committee
was informed during the hearing that a qualified land surveyor had been
appointed and that it was expected that all the outstanding issues in this
regard would be sorted out by March 2007.

However, to deal with land, you need to physically survey it and for that
you need a surveyor who has graduated from university. There were three
universities that produced surveyors, namely the University of Pretoria,
the University of Durban and the University of Cape Town. Currently, only
two universities are producing land surveyors and last year UCT only
produced six, of which a couple were poached by parastatals. So we’ll
always have a bottleneck with land reform if we don’t sort out this
problem.

The big advantage, on the other hand, of the Ngonyama Trust, is that its
books are at least prepared by the Auditor-General. There are, however,
other trusts that are not audited by the Auditor-General and I will read to
you from the National Agricultural Marketing Council:


  With the closure of the former agriculture control boards, the remaining
  assets were transferred to agricultural trusts with specific commodities.
  In April 2006, the Agricultural Marketing Council decided to conduct an
  investigation into the functioning of these trusts. This investigation
  was finalised in 2006, and the following recommendations were made:


      The NAMC should urgently arrange a meeting with the Ministerial
      trustees to table and discuss ... and an induction process should be
      developed for the trust. Meetings should be held at least once a year.
      Memorandums of understanding, etc.


However, the most important one is that the financial statements should be
audited by the Auditor-General, as those are mostly statutory funds.

Now, the frightening thing about these agricultural trusts is that there is
more than R1,5 billion lying in there. These trusts are not audited by the
Auditor-General and it is a problem at this stage. For instance, the Citrus
Trust started off at R1,3 million. It’s now at R15 million. The Maize Trust
had R264 million; it now has R685 million. The Oil and Protein Seeds
Development Trust had R63 million; it has R146 million now, and so I can
continue.

The committee itself had a wonderful year with its challenges and what you
see here before you today, although we are not exactly doing justice to it
by putting it so late in the day, has been the product of a lot of hard
work and a lot of long hours. I would like, on behalf of the ANC, to thank
all the committee members from all the parties for their dedication and
their hard work with these reports. I put these reports to you. Thank you
very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:

   That the Reports be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Reports accordingly adopted.

The House adjourned at 19:06.
