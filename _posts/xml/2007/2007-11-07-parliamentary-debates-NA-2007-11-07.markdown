                              NOTICES OF MOTION


Dr S M VAN DYK(DA): Speaker, I hereby give notice that I intend moving the
following motion:

   That this House resolves to debate the state of affairs at the SA
   Airways. Thank you.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the ACDP, I give notice that I
shall move:

  That the House-


   (1)      notes that 31 October is an important date on the Christian
         calendar, as it was on this day in 1517 that Martin Luther made a
         courageous stand which opened the way for the Word of God to
         powerfully impact every area of life;

      2) acknowledges those heroes of the Christian faith who have impacted
         society for the good in establishing solid foundations which have
         resulted in the many freedoms we experience today. Thank you.

Mr L B LABUSCHAGNE: Speaker, I give notice that I shall move that the
Cabinet and ANC MPs who jumped on the winning Springbok World Cup bandwagon
remain on that bandwagon for the Springbok team until the next Rugby World
Cup in four years’ time.

                     CELEBRATION OF DEEPAWALI BY HINDUS

         against the apartheid government during her time in Parliament;

      3) recognises that the courage she has shown throughout her political
         career has earned her both national and international recognition
         leading to her being awarded 27 honorary doctorates, being
         nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, being made a Dame of the
         British Empire and former President Nelson Mandela awarding her the
         Order of Meritorious Service (Gold) in 1997;


      4) further recognises that since her retirement as an MP she has
         remained both committed to and outspoken in the cause of democracy;
         and

         and many more to come.

Agreed to.


                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE


                       (The late Zipporah Noisey Nawa)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move:

   That the House -


     1) notes with a deep sense of loss and profound sadness the passing
        away of hon Zipporah Noisey Nawa, who was a member of the National
        Assembly, on Monday, 5 November 2007;


     2) recalls that hon Nawa was a committed educator and was truly
        dedicated to teaching and learning through her 14 years of unbroken
        service as a school principal;


     3) further recalls her sterling work in the struggle for the
        emancipation of women and that she was a member of and served in
        various capacities on the ANC Women’s League Ramotse Branch;


     4) recognises the important role that hon Nawa played in the trade
        union movement and the working class struggle and that she was a
        member of the Executive Committee of Sadtu between 1990 and 2006;


     5) acknowledges the great contribution that hon Nawa made as a member
        of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services and the
        Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development; and

     6) conveys its deepest condolences to the Nawa family, her loved ones
        and the African National Congress.

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to, members standing.

Ms M L MATSEMELA: Hon Speaker, hon members of Parliament, the Bible, in
Genesis 1:23, says that during the creation of a man God saw that a woman
should also be created. I think by then, as the Bible says that when a
woman was created, God made Adam to have a very deep sleep so that at the
end of the day a woman should appear as we are today.

Allow me to speak on the late Comrade Ms Zipporah Nawa, whom I have
categorised under the following: She was a cadre who met the challenges of
the 21st century; she was a professional and she was a parent. Comrade Ms
Nawa was born on 1 March 1945 in the rural village of Lebotlewane in
Moretele 1. In adulthood she retained the fondness for the countryside that
had also contributed to her education.

She had experienced the dust blowing in her face, heard the whistling of
the wind when it travels through the air, slapping her in the face and on
the legs, where the skin would dry up and these tiny missiles would sting.
On cold days, I assume, she would sometimes kick a stone and stub a toe. I
suppose many of us would understand why she joined the ANC.

I suppose those who have knowledge of the countryside understand all this.
Comrade Ms Zipporah Nawa served the public in the second decade of freedom
so as to meet the needs of the poor. President Thabo Mbeki once said:


   As government we believe we have a clear understanding of what the
   national agenda is and are determined to do everything possible to pursue
   it, working together with the people and all their representative
   formation in the people’s contract to advance the vision of the Freedom
   Charter.

Indeed, the late Ms Nawa was a cadre who was politically committed to
taking the masses to higher levels of human development. She was a cadre
who understood matters that measured human development and continually
analysed the indicators to improve the delivery of social, political and
economic services to the masses. She was a cadre who learnt to make
decisions which were not detrimental to society, a cadre who had mastered
all modern skills of accessing knowledge - some of these include the
traditional method of acquiring knowledge through experience – and a cadre
who possessed the flexible thinking process that is required of us to
compete in the extremely volatile 21st century global economy. However, a
flexible mind must not be confused with flexible principles. She was also a
cadre who had human relations.

We have been four comrades in this regard who have been deployed in the
Moretele constituency office. It was I, Comrade Chris Molefe, the late
Comrade Ms Nawa and Comrade Moseki.

We used to work very well in that constituency office. Comrade Nawa was
also a cadre with a source of stimuli for the creation of responsible
citizens. She was a cadre who at all times projected what was best for the
ANC, and by so doing, stimulated the masses to be organised, patriotic,
disciplined, modest and honest, and have a strong sense of social
conscience.

Earlier on I said that when God created a man and a woman, that creation on
its own, for instance, in the case of the late hon Nawa, made her to be a
very strong woman, because when you read the book of Genesis, it will tell
you about God telling the woman how she would labour; very bad. And again,
that on its own I took as making us women very strong, because the late
Comrade Nawa was also a mother.

As a professional, she started teaching in 1993 until 2006 at Lefofa
Primary School, from where she resigned as the principal to become a Member
of Parliament in 2006. As a mother, she is survived by her two sons and a
daughter. May her soul rest in peace.
Moulana M R SAYEDALI-SHAH: Madam Speaker, hon members, the hon Noisey Nawa
died suddenly and unexpectedly over the weekend. Like all who knew her, we
are in a state of shock and sadness.

We recognise that, indeed, she was a true daughter of the soil; someone
whose life became a testament to what can be achieved by the human spirit
when dedicated to the task of securing freedom based on considerations of
human rights. Her role in the political struggle for liberation and the
realisation and establishment of democracy is well recorded and documented.


She worked tirelessly for securing the rights of women, and also committed
over 14 years of her life towards the educational upliftment of the
community to which she belonged in Temba where she served as a principal of
the Lefofa Primary School.

Furthermore, she was an extremely kind and caring person who felt deeply
about the social issues facing our country. She was also a very
conscientious Member of Parliament and was also dedicated to her
constituency and various organisations to which she belonged, particularly
as a member of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services. She was
also distressed to see how many young people were incarcerated, often with
very long sentences, and constantly suggested ways in which this vicious
cycle could be broken.

Towards the middle of the year, she developed a chest complaint that made
it difficult for her to talk. Despite this, she attended two weeks of
intensive oversight inspections in Gauteng and in KwaZulu-Natal in late
July and early August. On occasions, she could scarcely speak. Yet, she
still put her questions to the officials by writing them down and asking
colleagues to read them out. That is the sort of dedication and commitment
that made her so special.

We, who knew her professionally, saw one side of her and deeply miss her.
One can imagine how much more her loss will be felt by her organisation,
the ANC and by her friends and family. We extend our deepest condolence to
all of them - but in the knowledge that her example and legacy will live
on. We in the DA wholeheartedly support the motion of condolence. Thank
you.

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, the IFP, in supporting the draft resolution
of the majority party, wishes to share the sentiments of the ANC. We share
the shock and the sadness that you feel at the loss of such an important
person. I say important because she is obviously someone who has done and
achieved a great deal within the ANC and certainly within the committee in
which I have worked with her - that is the Correctional Services committee.


The hon Nawa has been a very committed member of the Correctional Services
Portfolio Committee, as you have just heard from our hon colleague. I was
with her in those two weeks when she was so ill. Her sense of humour never
left her. She always continued with an incredible sense of humour and a
total dedication to the Correctional Services Portfolio Committee and the
work of the committee.

She continued to work throughout the time she was ill and was really and
truly a committed member. I am sure that the ANC is going to miss her
greatly. It is said that only the good die young, and obviously this was
indeed a good person that has died young. She was obviously a good person.
We wish to extend our condolences to the family, the ANC and the loved
ones. May her soul rest in peace. God bless her. Thank you. [Applause.]

Nksz S N SIGCAU: Somlomo obekekileyo, baPhathiswa abahloniphekileyo
namalungu abekekileyo ephela, kwakhona namhlanje sihlangene apha ukuza
kuthi ndlela ntle kwelinye ilungu lale Ndlu. Isela elikukufa sele
lisithathele kwakhona. Kubonakala ngathi sele sidibana rhoqo ngomba ololu
hlobo, yaye loO nto iyadanisa.

Esi sisikhumbuzo esibalulekileyo sokuba ixesha lethu apha emhlabeni
lifutshane, kwaye sinomsebenzi ekufuneka siwenzile kwaye siwuphumezile
imihla ngemihla kweli ziko, ngoba asazi ukuba singabizelwa nini na
edingeni.

Umbutho ohloniphekileyo i-UDM wothukile kakhulu kukuva isithonga sokuwa
kwelungu lale Ndlu. Kusapho lwakwaNawa, kwizihlobo, nezalamane sithi:
Thuthwini! Lalani ngenxeba, akuhlanga lungehliyo. Okwenzekileyo kudaliwe,
kwaye kuyintando kaThixo. Nathi siyaya ngaphesheya. Lala ngoxolo nkosikazi
yakwaNawa. Wanga uThixo angawusikelela umphefumlo wakho. Enkosi.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Ms S N SIGCAU: Chairperson, hon Ministers present here and all hon
members, we are gathered here today yet again to pay tribute to another
member of this House. Like a thief, death has come again and snatched one
of us away. It seems as if our meetings to mourn a colleague are becoming
too regular, and that is disappointing.

This serves as an important reminder that we are on this earth for a
limited time only, and that each day we have work to do and to complete in
this institution, because we don’t know when we will be called up to meet
our Maker.

It was with great shock that the UDM received the news of the passing on of
the member of this House. To the Nawa family, their friends and next of
kin, we say: Don’t despair! Let her soul rest in peace. What has happened
was the will of God. We are also going to join them when our time comes.
Rest in peace, Mrs Nawa! May God bless your soul! Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr H B CUPIDO: Madam Speaker, the ACDP joins this House in conveying its
sincere condolences to the family and friends of the late hon Mrs Nawa,
especially to her political party, the ANC, and to all the other
organisations she represented in our society.

It is our sincere hope that they have the assurance and confidence that she
has gone to be with her Maker, and we pray that they will experience the
peace of Jesus Christ at this time.

We acknowledge the high esteem in which the hon Nawa was held in terms of
the role she played in the struggle for nonracialism, nonsexism and a
united and democratic South Africa. We commend her for her commitment to
democracy and social justice in our country, and we pray that God Almighty
will sustain those who mourn her passing. Thank you.

Dr C P MULDER: Agb Mevrou die Speaker, die Vryheidsfront Plus assosieer ons
graag met die mosie wat voor die Huis dien. Die agb lid Nawa was persoonlik
as lid nie aan my baie goed bekend nie. Sy was nie baie lank lid van
hierdie Huis gewees nie en sy was maar vir bietjie meer as ‘n jaar ‘n lid
van die Parlement. Maar uit haar currikulum vitae en uit dit wat haar
kollegas van haar gesê het, is die belangrike rol wat sy gespeel het
spesifiek met betrekking tot vroue, baie duidelik. Die bemagtiging van
vroue het haar baie na aan die hart gelê, saam met haar betrokkenheid by
die onderwys haar hele lewe deur.

Ons dra graag ons medelye oor aan haar familie en haar naasbestaandes,
asook aan haar party, wat ‘n kollega verloor het, en ons wil hul graag
sterkte toewens en ons vertrou dat dit met hulle goed sal gaan op die pad
vorentoe. Baie dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, the Freedom Front Plus gladly supports the
motion before the House. The hon member Nawa was not personally known to
me. She has not been a member of this House for very long and she was only
a Member of Parliament for little over a year. From her curriculum vitae
and from what her colleagues have said about her, the important role she
played regarding women is very evident. The empowerment of women was very
close to her heart along with her involvement with education throughout her
whole life.

We would like to sympathise with her family, her next of kin and her party
who have lost a colleague. We would like to wish them all the best and we
trust that it will go well with them on the road ahead. Thank you very
much.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Hon Speaker and hon members, I may not have known the late
hon Zipporah Nawa in person, but as a human being, I believe that all
persons have been created in the image of God and that she therefore
deserves love, respect, service and understanding.

That she was unknown to a good number of us means she was not
controversial. She had a quiet disposition that allowed her to do her work
without seeking attention by sometimes speaking for the sake of it.

That she towered and rose among the ranks to become a school principal,
speaks volumes about her to follow instructions and carry them out. It is
not easy to run a school these days. That she did so for over a decade, she
definitely deserves an honour.

Having been a member of her party’s Women’s League in Ramotse gives a good
picture of who she was. Ramotse is, by the way, one of the slum areas in
the Hammanskraal area. Having been able to be elected to office in that
area means that Zipporah was made of sterner stuff.

Her response to a call to higher service prompts us in the UCDP to pay
homage to her, her family and her political party, the ANC, and to say that
that is the way of all flesh. Let us all take solace in the hope that her
soul will rest in peace. I thank you.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, I come to the podium today to sadly bid
farewell and pay respect to the beloved ANC MP, Zipporah N Nawa. Our
sincere condolences are extended to the bereaved family and friends of the
deceased. This condolence is especially extended to the loving sons and
daughter of Mama Zipporah.
Nawa was a great comrade in the fight against apartheid and active in her
contributions as an ANC MP. We express our sincere condolence to the ANC on
the loss of a great comrade and a defender of human rights.

Our condolences are further extended to the royal house under the auspices
of the chieftaincy of Chief Simon Molathlegi, who has a strong bond to the
family through Nawa’s late husband.

Hon Zipporah Noisey Nawa, we salute you. May you rest in peace in the
gardens of Heaven, knowing that you have sacrificed for the people and that
your strength, hope and zeal, shall live on in our democracy for centuries
to come. Rest in peace. I thank you.

[Mr M T LIKOTSI: Speaker, we as the APC associate ourselves with all the
other parties in sending our condolences to Mrs Nawa’s family since she has
departed from this earth. We are sending these condolences from the depth
of our hearts and we say to her family, friends and the party that she
loved so much, may they be comforted. What has happened to them is nothing
new, since death touches us all. We hope that through her death members of
her party will work harder and continue with the struggle that we are in,
which is that of struggling for our freedom.

The educational experts should work even harder on her behalf so that
education can continue to develop. Those who are on the side of the
workers, since she was an activist, should also stand up and continue with
the workers’ struggle in honouring the icon that is no more. These are our
condolences and we say may her soul and that of all the departed believers
rest in peace. I thank you.]

Mr S SIMMONS: Madam Speaker, the NA supports the motion of condolences in
respect of the late hon Z Nawa as it appeared on the Order Paper. We want
to express our sincere condolences to the Nawa family, friends and the ANC.

The hon Nawa served in this House for a short period of time, but had to do
her work in a difficult portfolio committee. We wish to thank her for her
services to all South Africans in all ways that she contributed. May her
soul rest in peace. I thank you.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I take it that there are no objections to the
adoption of the motion by the House, and I only wish to add the feelings
and the views of the Presiding Officers of this House - the Deputy Speaker,
myself, the House Chairpersons. We will convey all the sentiments expressed
in this House this afternoon to the family.

Before we proceed with the rest of the business, we now wish to ask the
House to rise to observe a moment of silence in memory of the late hon
Nawa.

The condolences of the House will be conveyed to the Nawa family.

                  ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Speaker, hon members of the House,
ladies and gentlemen, the amendment Bill before us arises out of the recent
experiences we have had of our inability to significantly lower the cost to
communicate, of increasing access to, and the affordability of information
and communications technologies.

One of the challenges South Africa and many other African countries faced
was that sufficient investment in the infrastructure was not occurring. At
a summit held in Kigali, Rwanda, on Connect Africa, sponsored by the
African Union and the International Telecommunications Union - ITU - at
which seven heads of state participated, it became abundantly clear that
55% of the unconnected population of the continent will not become
connected unless we create new models and especially have governments
intervening.

This was in line with our thinking as  expressed  in  this  amendment  Bill.
While the World Economic Forum readiness index had found our policies to  be
some of the  best  among  our  peers  in  developing  countries,  the  World
Economic Forum found  we  were  low  on  uptake  and  usage  of  ICTs.  This
amendment Bill facilitates the intervention by  government  to  ensure  that
strategic infrastructure investment is provided  to  extend  access  to  and
affordability of, information and communication  technologies  services.  It
also provides a framework for Icasa  -  our  regulator  -  for  licensing  a
public entity to achieve the strategic intention of reduction of  costs  and
the extension of access and affordability.

This thinking is a paradigm shift in the sector not  only  in  South  Africa
but throughout the continent. Throughout the  continent,  several  questions
have arisen to which this proposal responds. The questions that  were  asked
were provided  by  the  private  and  public  sector,  as  well  as  by  the
regulatory bodies. The questions are: What is it  that  we  must  do,  given
that rural areas are usually  not  seen  as  a  market  for  private  sector
investment?

Satellite coverage is a possible solution for these areas. But satellite  is
too expensive. So, what should we do? The kind of  partnership  and  funding
models and mechanisms for absorbing whatever funds we have,  have  not  been
appropriate. What is it that we can do?

The overwhelming answer and consensus of  all  the  different  stakeholders,
those from the private sector, namely  operators,  satellite  providers,  IT
equipment and  device  manufacturers,  etc,  to  the  Development  Financial
Institutions as well as governments, was: African governments should  invest
in  the  building  or  provision  of  broadband  infrastructure,   including
wireless broadband and especially the most efficient and less expensive.

Government should provide  frameworks  for  sharing  common  infrastructure,
access points, spectrum, devices, content and knowledge, especially in  poor
and underserviced areas, in order to meet our Millennium Development  Goals.
That government should help to  reduce  the  costs  of  doing  business  and
improve  affordability  by  all  while  not  suppressing   but   encouraging
competition.

This amendment Bill does just that. It does  not  suppress  competition  but
allows for strategic intervention by  government,  where  the  market  fails
while providing a framework for licensing in such circumstances.

The shrinking pool of investment capital and the failed initiatives  by  the
private sector to address the issues of costs to communicate, has led us  to
these critical steps of amending the Electronic Communications Act  in  line
with the concept of a developmental state.

The process within the parliamentary committee has been very thorough and  I
thank all members of the portfolio committee for  diligently  engaging  with
the amendment. I also thank the ICT sector operators and the  regulator  for
giving opinions, advice that generally was  not  violently  opposed  to  the
Bill and for accepting the principle of the need  for  strategic  government
intervention that can spur competition in the expansion of  ICT  access  and
services.  I thank, particularly, the  new  chairperson  of  the  committee,
Comrade Vadi for his demonstrated  leadership  in  steering  this  Amendment
Bill through in such a tight schedule, especially in  an  area  he  had  not
been as familiar as the previous chairperson.

Finally, I’d like to thank my  departmental  staff,  especially  Ms  Mashile
Matlala and the policy section under which she has worked very closely  with
my deputy. They have worked round the clock to ensure the  passage  of  this
Bill.

I would like to urge this House to pass this Bill, which will assist  us  in
bringing the advantages of ICTs closer to our people  and  achieve  some  of
the Millennium Developmental Goals for our country. I thank you.

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, South Africa would not, in fact, have had a
problem with a lack of competition in the infrastructure layer if the
Electronic Communications Act had not contained the one section that we
opposed in that law. The Electronic Communications Act is Parliament’s law.
It is also our law.

We reconceptualised the Convergence Bill as it was, to deal not only with
convergence but also with competition. The absence of competition that has
slowed us to a snail’s pace was – let it be said – the product of policy
failure, which gave Telkom too long an exclusivity period and then tried to
introduce a duopoly under adverse conditions.

Legislating in a policy vacuum in 2005, we threw the sector open to
competition, except for that one section. Section 5(6) prevents Icasa, the
Independent Communications Authority of SA, from issuing invitations to
apply for network licences above a certain scope.

A properly empowered regulator applies its expert mind precisely to such
matters – how to stimulate and create incentive investment and competition
in areas where it is lacking. The Electronic Communications Act, however,
contains a red robot: Everyone has to wait until our hon Minister issues
policy directions in terms of which Icasa can issue an ITA, invitation to
apply, not only for the big networks but also for any licence for in which
a state-owned entity holds 25% or more. The light remained resolutely red.

Then enters the hon Public Enterprises Minister to turn the light from red
to green. Unfortunately, he did so, of course, using the only entities over
which he holds sway – the SOEs.

I would like to say that the DA, like every party in nearly every country
in the world, is opposed to a return to state telecoms, and I mention that
because our hon Minister described a paradigm shift in Africa, which, I
think, we must be really careful about.

The case for liberalisation in telecoms is conclusive, but our telephone
minister number two - as I nicknamed the Public Enterprises Minister - made
proposals that sounded as if they had, in fact, the potential to break the
bottleneck in terrestrial backbone facilities provided, of course, that
they remain limited to a wholesale, cost-oriented offering to operators.

Infraco, in other words, had the potential to serve the goals of the pro-
competitive Electronic Communications Act. Now, Infraco could not simply be
deemed a licence under its own Act, for legal reasons and also because it
must fit the logic of the Electronic Communications Act. It had to be
brought into Icasa’s domain. Regrettably, the amending Bill tabled by our
hon Minister brought it firmly into her own domain, rather than the
regulator’s.

The DOC, Department of Communications, leapt at the opportunity to
introduce an effective parallel licensing regime under which it could
license its own SOEs to perform strategic infrastructure interventions -
and we are talking here only about infrastructure interventions. Sentech,
of course, already is supposed to play such role – one wonders.

However, such a provision as the one tabled, unconstrained, was far too
vague and broad. Our communications committee has instead placed this
provision within the Electronic Communications Act’s policy direction-
making section, where it is automatically subject to checks and
constraints. It is the logical place to put it since that makes it the
extension of section 5(6), which is essentially exception to the general
Electronic Communications Act prohibition on ministerial influence upon
licensing decisions.

Let me say that it remains regrettable that this amendment does not open
the ITA - which is to follow - to private sector entities that do wish to
build infrastructure.

It is no more than a form of damage control against the ambitions of both
telephone Ministers. However, because it goes someway to achieving such
damage control, we will, today, support it. As our colleague, the hon Manie
van Dyk, supported Infraco but made many warnings, we echo those very same
warnings.

We do warn against the return to state telecoms. What we need is not the
competition between two Ministers, which we are going to get. They are
already competing with each other on undersea cables to the east and to the
west of our continent. What we need is real and open competition. Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr S E KHOLWANE: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, indeed,
it would be important for me to appreciate the well-calculated decision by
the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises to ensure that they do refer
this matter to the Portfolio Committee on Communications, so that we deal
with this matter of the amendment of the Electronic Communications Act
accordingly.

When we were debating the second reading of the Infraco Bill, I said - and
I will repeat it again today – that across the political spectrum, we are
all in agreement that the cost of communication services in this country is
too high.

All the stakeholders that appeared before the committee on 31 October 2007,
during the public hearings, shared the common objectives of government,
that is to expand access to information, communication and technology
infrastructure and services and, furthermore, to make strategic
interventions in infrastructure investment.

However, we all differed on how government should achieve these objectives.
Most of the submissions, with the exception of a few, suggested that normal
processes of licensing should be followed. However, we are moving from the
premise that indeed government should play an important role in ensuring
that we do bring down the costs of telecommunications.

We also acknowledge that some of the presentations were informed by the
fact that most of those who made the submissions were against intervention
by the state. They suggested an approach where the state does not intervene
in this industry.

Of course, they based their argument on the fact that government
intervention through Telkom could not yield the expected results and,
therefore, government should fold its arms, watch and rely on the goodwill
of the market to provide solutions – a fact we disputed and still do even
now. Our view is that we should learn from what happened with Telkom and
ensure that it does not happen again.

The Bill provides an opportunity for government to intervene on
infrastructure investment whenever deemed necessary in order to enable
government to address some of the significant challenges, such as improving
on government service delivery and supporting the objectives of the
Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for SA, Asgisa, and to provide the
much-needed bandwidth for strategic projects and consumers at large in
order to fast-track development.

We should accept that we could not find the logic to limit this
intervention only to Infraco, whilst we all agree that ICT, Information and
Communication Technology, is a dynamic industry. However, we should note
that the current provisions of the principal Act do not cater for the
facilitation of strategic intervention by government in the ICT sector,
hence the proposed amendments.

In order to ensure that the Minister intervenes in accordance with the
strategic objectives, the Minister needs to consult or get Cabinet’s
approval before initiating and facilitating intervention. This would ensure
strategic infrastructure investment and also provide for the framework for
the licensing of a public entity by Icasa in terms of chapter 3.
Indeed, it is regrettable that my colleague in the Portfolio Committee on
Communications thinks that the Minister wants to usurp the powers of Icasa,
which is not true. In fact, we confirm that Icasa has to deal with
licensing. The Minister provides the framework for licensing so that Icasa
could perform its task without any fear or favour.

We should also emphasise the point that during the Infraco debate, we
indicated that there is a need for both Ministries to ensure that they
develop policy to regulate both Infraco and Sentech, because if they are
not regulated, we might find a situation where there are duplications.
Linked to that is the matter of scheduling, which Sentech has continuously
raised. We think that it is a very important matter that we need to take
up.

As I have indicated, we are of the view that as a developmental state, we
must intervene. Whatever happened with the Telkom intervention, we must
acknowledge and learn from it as we move forward. Since I arrived here, I
have heard people talking on this platform, still complaining about the
Telkom issue. I wonder when that matter would be left in the past. Maybe at
one point, it will be so that we can focus ahead in a manner that would be
productive for our society at large.

In conclusion, one would like to extend one’s appreciation for the industry
on the input it has made during the public hearings, which were robust and
challenging. We would also like to extend our appreciation to the state law
advisers, committee researchers and the department’s officials who have
made sure that our work became easier in terms of co-operation and so on.
Without any hesitation and doubt, the ANC will support this Bill. Thank
you. [Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Chairperson, once again the Portfolio Committee on
Communications has turned the potentially problematic drafting of law into
acceptable law and the IFP will support these proposed amendments to the
ECA.

It is a pity that the ECA, in fact, had to be tinkered with as all of us in
the committee realised that it was a finely-tuned piece of legislation.

However, as you have heard from hon Ms Smuts, we now have what appears to
be two Ministers operating in the sphere of communications – in some kind
of parallel ICT universe. And, we all know that attempts to deal with the
licensing of Infraco via public enterprises travelled a very long and
winding road which led directly to the door of the Communications
Committee.

Infraco can now be licensed. We indeed hope that all the hype that Infraco
will reduce the cost of access to ICT infrastructure will come true and
very soon - to its credit - the Communications Committee under its new
chairperson, I hope hearings on what were initially purported to be minor
amendments which they most certainly were not, and we are indebted to the
industry in general for their outstanding contributions.

The amendments before us today protect the Regulator – Icasa- from direct
ministerial intervention as is required by our Constitution. But like Ms
Smuts in the DA, the IFP is concerned about any attempts to entrench state-
owned entities in the ICT sector. Thank you.

Mr H B CUPIDO: Hon Chairperson, the ACDP supports the Electronic
Communications Amendment Bill before the House today.

Electronic Communications has taken the world by storm in recent years and
has changed the way people in all spheres of life communicate with one
another by using computers and cellphone connections; the world has become
a village called a global village.

According to the 2006-07 South African Survey, in 2004, 82 out of   1 000
people had access to a personal computer and 78 out of a 1 000 were
Internet users. I am sure that three years down that line these numbers
must have been doubled by now, at the same time the UK had 628 per 1 000
Internet users and the USA had 630.

The competition among service providers has drastically increased with more
and more mind-blowing products and unique facilities coming onto the
market.
The ACDP has no doubt that the explosion of electronic communication
technology is of great benefit to South Africa and African markets as a
whole. We need to be informed and in contact in order to keep up with the
rest of the world.

The ACDP welcomes the investment and the possible reduction in
infrastructure cost, the improvement in service delivery and the support
that will flow forth through Asgisa and the benefits consumers will receive
in general. Thank you.

Dr P W A MULDER: Voorsitter, die opwindende aspek van hierdie Minister se
werk en departement is dat dit haar taak is om seker te maak dat Suid-
Afrika nie agterraak by die ongelooflike tempo waarteen die kommunikasie,
tegnologie en telekommunikasiewêreld vandag orals ontwikkel nie. Dit maak
dit opwindend aan die een kant, maar aan die ander kant plaas dit vreeslike
druk op elkeen van ons, ook in die komitee in hierdie Parlement om te sorg
dat ons bybly met alle ontwikkelinge.

Suid-Afrika is die ekonomiese reus van Afrika en Suid-Afrika word gesien as
een van die sewe opkomende ekonomieë in die wêreld. Ons goedontwikkelde
infrastruktuur is een van die hoofredes vir Suid-Afrika se ekonomiese
posisie in Afrika en in die wêreld, daarom durf ons nie agter raak wat dit
betref nie.

Die VF Plus gaan hierdie wet en die wysiging aan die oorspronklike wet
steun, omdat ons geensins die indruk wil skep dat ons in die pad staan van
ontwikkeling op hierdie terrein nie. Wat wel waar is, as mens na die wêreld
kyk met wie ons kompeteer en as ons kyk na ander lande met wie ons
ekonomies kompeteer, dan blyk dit dat mededinging en kompetisie die beste
metode orals is om wel tred te hou met hierdie ontwikkelinge sover dit
gaan. Ons durf nie daardie les nié leer nie.

In hierdie geval is die regering besig met die strategiese ingryping wat
nie die ideale wyse is nie, maar dit lyk in die lig van omstandighede dat
daar nie ander oplossings is nie en daarom sal ons dan wel hierdie wet tans
steun. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Chair, the exciting part of this Minister’s work and that
of her department is that it is her responsibility to ensure that South
Africa does not fall behind on the incredible pace at which the
communication, technology and telecommunication world is developing all
over today.

It is exciting on the one hand, but on the other hand it also places
immense pressure on us individually in the committee of this Parliament to
ensure that we keep up with all the developments.

South Africa is the economic giant of Africa and South Africa is seen as
one of the seven upcoming economies in the world. Our well-developed
infrastructure is one of the main reasons for South Africa’s economic
position in Africa and in the world, therefore we dare not fall behind
regarding this.

The FF Plus will support this Act and the amendments to the original,
because, by all means, we do not want to create the impression that we
stand in the way of development in this area.

There is truth in the matter, when you look at the world that we compete
with and if we look at other countries with which we compete economically,
it is clear that rivalry and competition are the best methods to keep track
of these developments as far as it goes everywhere. We dare not attempt not
to learn this lesson.

In this instance the government is busy with a strategic intervention,
which is not the ideal way, but in the light of circumstances, there are no
other solutions and, therefore we will currently support this Act. Thank
you.]

Mr R B BHOOLA: Chairperson, in view of the telecommunications situation in
South Africa, and noting that Telkom has for a very long time been the sole
service provider, a standard cost has been established. With the
introduction of Infraco, we hope that telecommunications services will
receive a more competitive and lower costing.

At the end of the day, one of our country’s challenges is making services
more accessible and affordable so that those hampered by poverty may enjoy
them too, and in turn contribute to social development. This factor of
social development is paramount in every faculty of government and
business. This statement must not be misconstrued. What we are saying is
that quality services need to be made cost-effective for everyone.

From this amending Bill we gather that even if Infraco remains a government
entity, there is no guarantee that costing in telecommunications shall
decrease or that we will not end up with a situation similar to that
involving Telkom.

Telecommunications is used for a variety of reasons and it contributes
greatly to our progress. Today’s technology has privileged us with the
opportunity to succeed at the press of a button. I do not intend wandering
into the aftermath of apartheid, but reality is that we are challenged to
bridge the divide between the haves and the have-nots, and this can only be
done by increasing accessibility.

The MF acknowledges that the powers offered to the Minister in this Bill
may be criticised as a sign of excessive state intervention and as
infringing on the jurisdiction of Icasa, especially with regard to
licensing.

We sincerely hope that this will not be the case and that an amicable
agreement on co-operation can be reached between the two to fulfil the
mandate of providing efficient and effective telecommunications in South
Africa. The MF will support the Bill. Thank you.

Mr R D PIETERSE: Deputy Speaker, hon members, allow me to offer best wishes
to two special women on their birthdays: our Deputy President, who
celebrated her birthday this past Saturday, and hon Helen Suzman, a special
lady who celebrates her 90th birthday today. Best wishes to them, and may
they stay young for a very long time.

Agb lede, baie, baie jare terug het agb Dene Smuts, in samewerking met agb
Sue Vos, in ons komitee onder voorsitterskap van Ned Kekana, baie keer
aangevoer, en soms gesmeek, dat daar gekyk moet word na die hoë pryse van
telekommunikasie. Natuurlik was dit somtyds gemeng met destydse DP-politiek
en vandag se DA-politiek, maar niemand kan ontken dat dit die waarheid was
dat die pryse te hoog was nie.

Dit was ook meer as eenmaal aangehaal deur ons President. Ek onthou dat die
President ten minste drie keer in sy staatsrede die hoë Telkompryse
aangehaal het en gesê het dat dit moet verminder as ons enige direkte
buitelandse beleggings wil hê, en ook binnelandse kompetisie wil stimuleer.
So die President het dit baie keer genoem, maar niemand het blybaar aandag
daaraan gegee nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Hon members, many, many years ago in our committee chaired by Ned Kekana,
the hon Dene Smuts in co-operation with the hon Sue Vos, many times argued
and sometimes pleaded, that the high prices of telecommunication should be
looked into. Of course it was sometimes mixed with the then DP politics and
today’s DA politics, but nobody can deny that it was the truth that these
prices were too high.

It was quoted more than once by our President. I can remember that the
President in his opening address quoted the high prices of Telkom at least
three times and said that it must be lowered if we want any direct foreign
investments, as well as stimulate domestic competition. So, the President
mentioned it many times but apparently nobody paid any attention.]

Neotel and Usals, the underserviced area licences, were there, but still
very little downward movement was seen in terms of prices. Neotel on its
own experienced, and is currently experiencing, serious challenges and
hopefully the differences between Neotel, the Department of Public
Enterprises and the Minister will soon be resolved.

We need state intervention to ensure that we drive down prices aggressively
and further stimulate competition. But most importantly, we need to take
infrastructure and services to the poor, the rural and the marginalised.

Nou is die tyd om ‘n beter lewe, ‘n lewe op ’n ander vlak, aan al ons mense
te gee, ongeag ras, kleur, seks of gestremdheid. Ek wil graag beklemtoon
wat Telkom nie doen nie, veral in ander gebiede soos die platteland en die
armer gebiede van ons land.

Suid-Afrika is ‘n land van baie moontlikhede. Ons mense lewe in ‘n periode
van hoop en ek kan waarlik sê hul hoop staan nie beskaamd met die staat se
tussentrede nie.

Die vraag wat ek graag wil vra, agb Minister, is: Is Infraco die voertuig
wat die uitdaging moet aanvat en aanpak? Ek dink daar is ‘n deel en daar is
plek vir die privaatsektor. As hulle saam met Infraco hierdie kwessie kan
aanpak, sal die goed baie vinniger gebeur en teen baie goedkoper pryse. My
probleem is dat, as ons net na Infraco kyk, gaan ons moontlik nie die mas
opkom nie.

Hierdie voorgestelde wetgewing gee die Minister tyd om gouer aan sekere
uitdagings aandag te skenk, veral na samesprekings met en goedkeuring van
haar kollegas in die Kabinet.

Namens die groot en magtige ANC hou ek hierdie voorgestelde wetgewing voor.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Now is the time to give a better life, a life on another level, to all our
people, irrespective of race, colour, sex or disability. I want to
emphasise what Telkom does not do, especially in other areas like the rural
and the poorer areas of our country.

South Africa is a country of possibilities. Our people are living in a
period of hope and they can truly say that their hope is not in vain with
the government’s intervention.

The question that I want to ask, hon Minister is: Is Infraco the vehicle
that will undertake and tackle the challenge? I think there is a part and
place for the private sector. If they undertake this issue together with
Infraco things will happen much faster and with cheaper prices. My problem
is that, if we only look at Infraco, we might not make it.

This proposed legislation gives the Minister time to look at some
challenges sooner, especially after the discussions and approval of her
colleagues in the Cabinet.

On behalf of the mighty and powerful ANC, I hold before you the proposed
legislation. [Applause.]]
The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chair, I would like to thank all the hon
members of the House and the parties that have supported the passage of
this amending Bill.

In part, the reasons for us going this route, have nothing to do with the
objections that have been mentioned, for example by the opposition member
Dene Smuts. Hon members will remember that we changed because everyone had
asked that we do certain things in our policies and in our laws. These
include such things as number portability, pre-selection and allowing
everyone to provide facilities.

Ka Sesotho, ke sa ntse ke eme. [In Sesotho we say: I am still standing.]

Ek wag nog. [I am still waiting.]

They have not provided those facilities in the private sector. It is the
failure by the private sector to provide those facilities that have created
the kind of problems that have been mentioned. Now that they are doing so,
there are instances of encouragement.

The most important thing for us to do is to make sure that this country,
which is a developmental state, pays attention not only to two sectors of
our population - the business and urban sector – but also to the rural
areas. Nobody has been paying attention to the rural areas.

We know that the cost of communication also has something to do with the
bandwidth that goes out of or into a country, who controls it and what
their costs are. If that bandwidth is high, the cost will always stay high.
This is what many developing countries have found out and we can learn from
those developing countries.

Look at India. Because their bandwidth was provided by people from outside
India, particularly for the businesses of the United States, the prices
came down. But in any other country that is not the case, and we have proof
of that. This resource is necessary in order to be able to extend ICTs to
rural areas.

The second area is that there were conditions placed on Telkom when it was
first partly privatised, and those conditions favoured the private sector.
I could not change the shareholders’ agreement between Telkom and the then
parties that were involved in Telkom. Neither could I unilaterally change
the shareholders’ agreement between Telkom and Vodacom.

Today we hear that it is government or it is me or this part of government
that did that. In fact, what pushed for this situation was that everyone in
government had been told that it was important that the private sector took
over. But, we saw what the private-sector-driven policies and practices
have done with regard to the cutting off of telecommunications in many of
our rural areas or underserviced areas.

The hon Pieterse asked whether Infraco is the only way to intervene? It
certainly is not, but is a strategic way for government to intervene. Since
we have taken that policy decision to have government intervene by setting
up a company like Infraco, many other companies want to come to the fore
because there is actually quite a lot of business that can run on this
infrastructure.

So, the intention is not only to have Infraco, but particularly to make
sure that international bandwidth, which is one of the reasons why our
costs are high, can actually be brought down.

I now come to the issue surrounding the licensing conditions. The Bill
certainly does not make any difference in the relationship. It is Icasa
that will issue the licence for Infraco and for any other entity that
government deems a strategic intervention. It is Icasa, and not the
Minister, that sets the conditions of that licence. So there is no reason
to fear excessive intervention in the work of Icasa. On that basis, Icasa
itself has supported this Bill.

I would like to say that I would be very happy if the House could pass this
Bill so that we can get down to the business of making ICTs possible or
available to the most disadvantaged people of our country, whom these have
not been able to reach. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

      CONSIDERATION OF SHORTLIST OF CANDIDATES FOR APPOINTMENT TO MEDIA
                   DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSITY AGENCY BOARD

              (Report of Portfolio Committee on Communications)

Mr I VADI: Deputy Speaker, the term of office of the four board members of
the media development and diversity agency comes to an end in December this
year. In terms of the Media Development and Development Agency Act of 2002,
the NA must call for nominations from the public to fill these vacancies.
It must compile a short list of candidates and this House must recommend
the appointment to the President.

The Portfolio Committee on Communications has complied with these legal
prescripts. It had received 23 public nominations and interviewed eight of
the candidates. Having done that, the committee is pleased to recommend the
following list of candidates for appointment by the President to the media
development and diversity agency - MDDA board: The first person that we are
recommending is Professor Guy Berger. He is the head of the school of
journalism and media studies at Rhodes University. The second candidate is
Ms Nomonde Gongxeka, of Yizo Yizo fame, actress and currently employed at
the SABC. The third candidate is Mr Siviwe Minyi, a media trainer and
facilitator from the Western Cape. The last one is Ms Gugu Msibi, former
political journalist and now a media consultant.

The committee believes that the candidates who have been recommended bring
with them a range of skills, which will contribute positively to the MDDA.
The committee also wishes to express its sincere gratitude to the four
outgoing members of the MDDA board. By all accounts, they have discharged
their responsibilities diligently, and efficiently.

We wish to thank Ms Khanyi Mkhonza, the current chairperson of the board;
Dr Gibson Boloka; Ms Kerry Cullinan; and Prof Govin Reddy, for the enormous
contributions they have made to the MDDA board and the agency itself. They
have played a significant role in promoting media diversity and in terms of
content in the media, the ownership of media institutions, language,
cultural diversity in the media and presenting varied perspectives to
contemporary social and political issues.

Finally, the committee hopes that members of this assembly will encourage
local community radio stations and local newspapers, in their
constituencies, to apply for funding from the media development and
diversity agency. These funds are there for the development of local media
and I am hoping that members of this assembly will encourage their
constituencies to take advantage of this opportunity. I thank you.

Question put: That the following candidates be recommended for
consideration for appointment to the Media Development and Diversity Agency
Board: Ms Gugu Msibi, Ms Nomonde Gongxeka, Prof Guy Berger and Mr Siviwe
Minyi.

Question agreed to.

Ms Gugu Msibi, Ms Nomonde Gongxeka, Prof Guy Berger and Mr Siviwe Minyi
accordinly recommended for consideration for appointment to the Media
Development and Diversity Agency Board.

 THE CONCEPT OF SOUTH AFRICA AS A DEVELOPMENTAL STATE, THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL
 AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS TO THE POOREST OF THE POOR, THE IMPACT OF THIS IN
 THE SADC REGION AND WHETHER SOUTH AFRICA SHOULD BECOME THE HEGEMONIC POWER
                       IN THE INTEREST OF THIS REGION

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr M B SKOSANA: Acting Speaker, I am quite aware that the subject itself is
very broad, and rightly so, so that we can all have a bite of it. I will
briefly deal with the first aspect of it and one of my colleagues will deal
with the last aspect of it, namely for the region. Hon members, both the
Ministers of Finance and Public Service and Administration dealt with the
idea of South Africa being a developmental state some time ago. Today we
have heard that the hon Minister of Communications is also joining in on
that.

I have often grappled intensely with the question, of whether as a
political collective, as public representatives in the House and among the
custodians of the Rousseauian contract with the people – the social
contract if you like - we have in fact, come to a common understanding of
what a developmental state should mean to all South Africans. So far we
have accepted and embraced the notions of a constitutional and the
democratic state. As a result, we have encountered less difficulty in
building the relevant institutions to make these concepts meaningful to the
ordinary South African men and women in the streets. I must say that hon
members should please take credit for that.

However, the crucial question remains whether we possess the capabilities
to do likewise with the ideals of a developmental state, whether we could
master the necessary courage and insight to define development in the terms
of its normative goals to realise the well-being of the poor and the
marginalised. Umer Chapra, in his book “The Future of Economics and Islamic
Perspective” argues that these goals may include not only economic well-
being but also human brotherhood and socio-economic justice, sanctity of
life, property, individual honour, mental peace, happiness, family, as well
as social harmony; whereas, Denis Goulet defines development as choices and
too often in interstate affairs, the choice is increasingly cruel against
the poor nations.

One of the major problems dogging the north-south trade agreements is the
variant meaning of development. Obviously, the rich nations of the world
understand development to mean the maximisation of wealth and consumption
for their own people. Similarly, the poor nations also seek a better life
for their own people, but the state of under-development has become their
pervasive weakness.

Another author, Ammartya Sen, among other development writers and
practitioners, sees development as freedom borne out of the removal of
substantive unfreedoms such as poverty, unemployment, poor health,
illiteracy and social deprivation. To realise this noble goal, the poor and
the marginalised must have full access to political freedoms, social
opportunities, economic facilities, transparency guarantees and protective
security.

Closer to home, I must also ask: Do we regard development as a tool for
distributive justice or has it become, and by default of the people, a
concentration of economic wealth and power in the hands of a few? Thirteen
years of liberation, and for a people emerging from a society marked by
huge wealth disparities, deep social inequalities, racial and repressive
legislation, how much progress has the developmental state made in
discarding the elements of the post-war, colonial and apartheid economic
development planning?
It is a historical fact that the primary objective of this economic
planning was to maximise wealth and consumption for the white minority to
wield political and economic power, imposing in the process a heavy burden
of perpetual poverty and hardships on the African majority. To what extent
has the development enabled the people to effect a revolutionary
eradication of the psychological damages inflicted by the Verwoerdian
concept of master-servant education, whose long-term consequences have
become an impediment to all forms of freedoms?

Some will argue that, why do you blame Dr Verwoerd when more than two
centuries before him, the likes of Herodotus, Hegel and Montesquieu, just
to name a few, had laid the foundation of all racial prejudices against the
African people for centuries to come? Therefore, the fate of racism for us
has been a history of the myth of the European people. Change cannot be
realised overnight.

Should it not be historically, theoretically and practically inherent in
the developmental state to inject at all levels a radical development
paradigm that says the people ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order hon member, a presiding officer should lead by
example. The time has expired. [Laughter.]

Mr M B SKOSANA: How many minutes did I have?
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: They were six. How many did you ask for?

Mr M B SKOSANA: Well, I did not know it was six.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, it is gone, sir. I am sorry about that. Next time
ask for ten. I call on Mr Njikelana.

Mr S J NJIKELANA: Ngiyabonga Phini likaSomlomo. [Thank you, Deputy
Speaker.]

The question of whether the state or markets should lead national economic
development continues to engulf economic discourse. History has proven that
markets alone have failed to address socioeconomic challenges faced by
society; hence the role of the state in leading a national development
agenda to promote social justice and equity amongst social groups has been
strongly advocated.

I would like to take cognisance as well of what Mr Skosana said,
particularly that the role of Parliament in moulding a developmental state
and its character should be highly recognised and placed at the centre of
our work. In keeping with that, I would like to also share what I see as
the key features of a developmental state.

Scholars globally have highlighted, amongst other things, that there is an
emphasis on market share over profit when moulding a developmental state.
They go on to talk about economic nationalism, protection of fledging
domestic industries, focus on foreign technology transfer, ensuring that
government’s delivery or ability to deliver is effective, alliance between
state, labour and industry, glaring scepticism on neoliberalism and the
Washington consensus, and prioritisation of economic growth over political
reform. The original conception and application of a developmental state,
which came from East Asia, was characterized by authoritarianism and, with
time, it has evolved to what is referred to as a democratic developmental
state. The international community embraced a state-led model of
development intended to bring about industrialisation and entrepreneurship
through intensive and deliberate effort in state intervention.

Let us then look at our local context. Rene Gradwohl states that the
fundamental policy shifts since 2003, using examples such as the 10-year
policy review, the National Public Works Programme, the new role of state-
owned enterprises, the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South
Africa, broad-based black economic empowerment, focus on delivery, the new
national skills development strategy, the ongoing review of state capacity
by the Forum of Directors-General of South Africa are clear indications for
the government of the second Mbeki Presidency seeking to refine the role of
the South African state in the process of generating more equally shared
development in the country.

However, I would also like to highlight that South Africa is a
developmental state in the making, because if you look at the shortcomings
of the neoliberal influenced economic policy, they have necessitated that a
shift towards a more interventionist government role should be placed. The
introduction and the application of Asgisa is one of the tools that
indicates the state’s intention to effect shared growth through active
intervention but the question still remains: Why a developmental state?

As we engage in debate on the developmental state, it is important to
understand that various developmental states were informed by diverse
stages in human history; hence we have seen evolvement in the modelling and
approach. Once again, Rene Gradwohl argues that widespread disillusionment
with failed neoliberal policy and descriptions and the encouragement of
efficient and successful states like Botswana and Mauritius paved the way
for the conception of developmental states to be hesitantly embraced as an
alternative development model for African states throughout the 1990s.

Obviously, amongst other things, is the fact that a developmental state is
highly characterized by its responsiveness to a changing environment, which
therefore means that, in moulding our state, we should ensure that we are
building a developmental state that has the capacity to be responsive to
changing conditions and, as such, should lead and manage economic
relations.

With regard to the implications and impact, currently, there is an
abundance of evidence as to how the state has focused on the indigent
through social services such as housing, access to health, and improvement
of social security through social grants, with particular emphasis on
social cohesion. I would also like to highlight the building of a rainbow
nation. Strong patriotism is fundamental in enabling a state to pursue a
cohesive and sustained development-orientated policy.

I would also like to share implications around economic issues. I would
like to start by saying that successful pursuance of a developmental agenda
by the state is contingent upon rapid accumulation and diffusion of social
capital and social construction of economic institutions. Recently, we have
actually made a breakthrough by formulating the national industrial policy
framework.

Obviously that would be coupled with the focus on ensuring that the
practitioners in the second economy are empowered through programmes driven
by the Department of Trade and Industry as well as programmes driven by all
the departments in the economic cluster. Furthermore, the state has
ensured, when it comes to international trade, that assisting African
countries would in the long run help South Africa in its economic
development. Amongst other things, issues such as removal of double
taxation have also been addressed.

One of the things that characterise a developmental state is its ability
and propensity to deepen democracy. We have seen in the current
dispensation the emergence through either legislation as well as
implementation of organs of popular power or governance. Reference in this
regard is made to ward committees, structures that help and assist ward
councillors, community policing forums and school governing bodies as well
as the erstwhile community development forums, although in certain areas
they are still active. If one takes a look at all these structures, it is
quite clear that that is a genuine attempt to ensure that democracy is not
only confined to representative character, but is also moved to higher
levels which one would call participatory democracy.

Our very Parliament has taken up annual programmes such as Taking
Parliament to the People by the NCOP, the People’s Assembly, the Women’s
and the Youth Parliament. We know from the executive side that there are
izimbizo, as well as public hearings through the parliamentary committees.
All those are practices and features that one would have only found in a
developmental state in the making.

Whilst one looks with great admiration as to our genuine attempts to have
tried to formulate, mould and implement a developmental state, there are
also challenges that face us. First and foremost are the ability and the
capacity of the state to deliver on its policies and programmes. Our
President, in his state of the nation address, has time and again laid an
emphasis on this matter, particularly on the improvement of service
delivery and the ability of the government to optimally utilise the budgets
allocated annually as well as the monitoring of implementation. We need to
take note of the extent to which we are able to mobilise people towards a
better life for all. It is accepted that although the state has a primary
role in upgrading these conditions for the poor, there is ample scope for
civil society and the private sector to also play a role.

Focus on rural development is also an area that needs noting. There is
unfortunately not much around rural development whilst there is an
Integrated Rural Development Strategy. As a result, underdevelopment is
still abundant in the rural areas. Inertia from established business
together with those who resist change whilst they benefited from apartheid
is still a glaring feature. Our ability to respond to environmental changes
as a developmental state is an area that needs careful consideration.

Reference here is made to currency fluctuations which are beyond our
control in addition to commodity prices which change erratically from day
to day, trade imbalances, inflation, and widening wealth disparities. One
can even make reference to a recent article by Mr Moeletsi Mbeki, where he
warned of South Africa’s industrial decline, which is leaving small islands
of wealth in a sea of poverty. Whilst I may not claim authority to such an
assertion, it is but an issue that is worth noting.

In conclusion, I would like to highlight that an alliance between the
state, civil society and business is a fundamental necessity. The state
should take the role of a leader in effecting a developmental agenda. A
strong and democratic state with clear objectives, internal cohesion,
popular legitimacy and the capacity to control economically powerful
factions of the population and direct the use of their resources, can
achieve democratic economic objectives much better than the market alone,
however defined. I thank you. [Applause.]

                WELCOMING OF DELEGATION FROM SLOVAK REPUBLIC

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I wish to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, His Excellency Mr
Jan Kubis and his delegation. [Applause]. Hon Minister, we welcome you to
our Parliament.

Mr J J M STEPHENS: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon  members,  my  good  friend,
the hon Njikelana, and I share some common ground on  this  issue.  He  says
that we are a developmental state in the process of being built.  I  am  not
sure if I agree with that, but we both agree that at this moment we are  not
a developmental state.

The saying that South Africa is a state crying out for  swift  and  dramatic
development is incontrovertible. Can we make poverty a thing  of  the  past?
The saying that South Africa is a developmental state  is  a  delusion,  and
the often-repeated assertion to the contrary does not make it  so.  We  lack
too much to qualify.

Jac Laubscher, a Sanlam group economist, wrote  the  following  in  Business
Day of 18 July 2007: “South Africa does  not  have  an  elite,  meritocratic
bureaucracy that  attracts  the  best  talent  in  the  country...”  Such  a
bureaucracy is of fundamental importance for a  developmental  state  -  one
that I pleaded for earlier this year. In the classic sense, a  developmental
state enjoys unwavering and consistent government action  within  a  context
where all sectors of society are united in a  single  hegemonic  development
project. This is patently absent in South Africa.

We focus on redressing the wrongs of the past rather than  on  addressing  a
prosperous future for all. The wrongs of the  past  will  be  redressed  and
their effects erased when everyone is  given  the  capability  to  share  in
general prosperity. When the focus is on making poverty  history,  then  all
sectors of society will unite with the willingness  to  make  the  necessary
sacrifices.

There has been development over  the  past  13  years  and  some  very  real
achievements too -  especially  in  the  important,  but  limited  areas  of
housing, domestic water and electricity supply.  But,  how  do  the  overall
developmental advances measure up against what is actually required to  make
poverty history? The answer to this is: Very badly.

Revisiting the miserable list of government  policy  failures  -  stretching
from health to education, unemployment reduction and industrial policy -  is
unnecessary. They are well documented.

Suffice it to say that the Finance Minister’s  economic  growth  projections
indicating a steady decline in growth from 4,9% this year to 4,5% next  year
before returning to only about 5% per year in 2009  and  2010  gainsays  any
claim to a successful developmental state. Given a target of 6%  growth  per
annum, we can accept that the target area will not  even  be  challenged  by
2010. Since the growth target was set with a  goal  of  halving  poverty  by
2014, we are clearly further than ever  from  achieving  this.  If  that  is
development, then all one can  ruefully  say  is:  “Some  development,  some
state.”

Should South Africa; or even, can South Africa become a developmental  state
in the classical sense. The phrase “developmental state” was  coined  by  an
American political scientist ... [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  would  the  member  take  a
question?
Mr J J M STEPHENS: When I have finished.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The member will take the question later on.

Mr J J M STEPHENS: ... Chalmers Johnson, to describe  the  economic  miracle
of Japan after World War II.  South  Korea  and  Taiwan  later  adopted  the
phrase to describe  their  similar  economic  development  methodologies.  A
classical developmental state is one that follows the  growth  methodologies
of these Tigers. Importantly, their growth methodologies were  pragmatically
developed and implemented in the context of the international regime of  the
day, as a political economist, T J Pempel says: “It is hard to  imagine  the
economic successes of these three had the United States not been so  anxious
to assist their economic enrichment.”

Much has changed. Opportunities such as  favourable  access  to  the  United
States markets  are  not  available  to  us.  Import  substitution  and  the
protectionism  they  practised  are  not  feasible  under  the  World  Trade
Organisation regime.

The 21st century international climate simply militates against our  ability
to follow the mid-20th century developmental methodologies.
Consequently, our concept of a developmental  state  must  be  a  derivative
rather than an emulation of the classical one. Yet, much can be learnt  from
the Asian successes.

Fortunately, since the unlamented demise of  the  Washington  Consensus,  no
one seriously doubts the pivotal role of the state in economic  development.
What the particulars of that role are and how they change over time  is  our
own  decision  -  given  our  history,  our   diverse   cultures   and   our
predilections. We must seek and find our own third way too.

Joseph Stiglitz says that the term “third way” has attained  different  and,
in some cases, quite specific connotations. But, what I mean,  as  he  does,
is that a third way lies between socialism,  with  an  intrusive  government
role, and laissez-faire economics,  with  a  minimal  government  role.  The
South  African  model  must  employ  market-conforming  methods   of   state
intervention  and  a  fixed  focus  on  addressing  future  opportunities  –
opportunities equally accessible to all.

In a developmental state of the third  way,  consensus  exists  between  all
sectors of society regarding developmental goals and the  means  to  achieve
them. The  goals  are  inclusive  and  not  exclusive  and  selective.  That
produces an unconditional commitment by all for the developmental project  -
a focus on economic growth that disproportionately empowers  the  poor;  not
through  handouts,  but  through  capability  enhancement  and   opportunity
creation. It is not developmental to give people houses, water,  electricity
or food.  It  may  be  charitable,  but  it  is  not  developmental.  It  is
developmental when government  enhances  people’s  capabilities  -  allowing
them to afford a house, water, electricity and  food.  It  is  developmental
when you give  people  quality  health  care  and  education  in  high-grade
facilities.

Capability enhancement  is  the  developmental  approach  pioneered  by  the
renowned Amartya Sen – an approach that the DA  fully  subscribes  to.  With
him we say: Development is freedom. Freedom, he says, can only exist  in  an
open democratic society. This we must maintain, develop and protect  at  all
costs. That is why the DA  embraces  an  open  society  –  a  society  where
freedom lives.

Democracy  by  itself  is  not  freedom  and  does  not  guarantee  freedom.
Democracy plus capability, plus  opportunity  is  freedom.  An  increase  in
capabilities is an increase in freedom - freedom to escape poverty;  freedom
to enjoy full social functionality;  and  the  capability  to  live  a  life
filled with accomplishment, boundless opportunity and  the  ability  to  use
it. Thank you. [Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: He can’t take a question because he went over the time.

Mr J J M STEPHENS: My time has expired?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: You have no time left to answer any questions.

Mr  J  J  M  STEPHENS:  Yes.  You  can’t  ask  the  question  otherwise  ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I did not say that  you  must  take  a  question.  I  am
speaking on your behalf to the hon Minister to say that you cannot take  the
question because you have no time  left.  [Interjections.]  So,  you  should
actually be saying thank you, Deputy Speaker.

Mr J J M STEPHENS: I would like to take the question. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, no – for saying ... [Interjections.]

Mr J J M STEPHENS: I would like to take the question.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Then you should have actually timed your speech to  make
sure that there is time for the question. [Interjections.] Will  you  please
take your seat, hon member.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon  members,  the  concept  of  a
developmental state implies a certain ethos  of  a  caring  government.  The
ethos is underpinned by a recognition that uplifting the poor and  defending
the weak among us is  the  first  and  most  important  duty  of  any  truly
democratic and just society. It is an ethos that says that  those  who  have
will not only give to those who do not have in order to promote their  self-
interest and protect their prosperity from the eventual wrath of those  with
nothing. Much to the contrary, it is based on the sort of  thing  that  says
that I can view myself as prosperous if my neighbour and his  neighbour  and
everyone of my fellows are also prosperous.  That  worth  is  not  something
that resides purely in an individual but depends on the general  wealth  and
wellbeing of the entire society.

The social, political and economic implications of the  developmental  state
for the poorest of the poor are thus benevolent. If indeed  we  accept  this
sort of ethos within the state, then we must also adopt  it  in  the  larger
context of our nation’s interaction with the outside world,  especially  our
neighbours. It therefore, means that in as much as  our  neighbours  do  not
prosper, we cannot prosper. As much as  they  do  not  succeed  politically,
socially and economically, we do not.

Thus, it is entirely contradictory to combine this ethos with  the  talk  of
hegemony or South Africa  assuming  such  status  in  the  region.  It  goes
without saying that South Africa has not only the  biggest  economy  in  the
region, but also the biggest on  the  continent.  Indeed,  our  natural  and
human resources outstrip those ... [Time expired.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Deputy Speaker, while the concept of a developmental
state is used to explain the exceptional growth performances in East Asian
countries, the success of a democratic developmental state will depend on
the capacity of that state to manage the complex and very delicate balance
between growth and social development. Balancing requires trade-offs, with
democracy and equity on the one side and economic growth policies and
strategies within a demanding competitive global on the other. Capacity and
capability are of course conditions for success and these factors present
enormous challenges in South Africa.

When we look at the continent of Africa we see a kaleidoscope of rich
cultures and historical traditions, but we also see a gap between the poor
and the rich that continues to widen. And, in South Africa we are still
plagued by inequalities, which are the cause of much tension.

Neither economic growth nor poverty alleviation programmes alone will be
sufficient to eradicate poverty. There is no substitute for creating more
productive employment and supply and demand for labour must change. While
education and skills development are key it will take two to three decades
for these sorts of interventions to begin to impact on the situation, so
long-term and short-term solutions must go hand in hand.

Some economists do not see South Africa as a developmental state but as a
redistributive state, focused on the transformation of the economy and
society.
Observers, both inside and outside the government, struggle to make sense
of South Africa’s role and identity in Africa. Some argue against a
hegemonic role for South Africa; others say we have hegemonic power whether
we like it or not, largely due to the fact that South Africa is less
vulnerable than other African states and presently more politically stable.
Dr Adam Habib of the Centre for the Study of Civil Society who supports
South Africa in the role of a hegemony, says simply being a pivotal state
means that South Africa will be rejecting a role of leadership which is
neither in our, nor the region’s best interest.

If being a hegemonic power means being in the forefront of addressing
issues of poverty, unemployment, marginalisation and inequality, how bad
can that be? Because of South Africa’s precarious First World and Third
World qualities, perhaps the argument that South Africa could best be
described as a potential hegemony makes most sense.

The ACDP would like to see South Africa’s position, whether hegemonic or
not, being sensible and realistic with a view to producing results rather
than posturing for position or being overly concerned with our image. South
Africa has a responsibility to do its utmost to actively and positively
impact the lives of not only the citizens of the SADC region but this
continent as a whole. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon member. I would just like to make a
little correction. I am not an Acting Speaker and I do not want Hansard to
be confused in terms of recording proceedings. The Speaker is very much
here – just two minutes away from this House.

Ms M M MDLALOSE: Madam Deputy Speaker, the ideology of viewing South Africa
as a developmental state is becoming increasingly popular. However, it is
important for us to determine if we are a developmental state in the true
sense of the ideology. Central to the concept of a developmental state is
the idea that a developmental state is focused on a single goal: to achieve
the highest economic growth possible. The developmental state is focused on
state intervention on manufactured goods, exports to promote economic
growth - state intervention has to support the market, and not replace it.

The state does not lead the market, but follows it. In addition, a
developmental state also implies a specific institutional set upon which
the role of society, and in particular the private sector, is crucial. In
addition, in a developmental regime all sectors of society are united in a
single hegemonic project, a national consensus regarding the objective
economic development together with a willingness to make the required
sacrifices to realise the objective.

Madam Deputy Speaker, when one considers all these points about a
developmental state it becomes obvious that we would be disillusioned to
think that we are one. South Africa is primarily a redistributive state,
focused on the transformation of the economy and society. We should
concentrate on what the role of government should be in a predominantly
free market economy, and focus our energies on the failures of the market
by scrutinizing our economic policies.

Our country cannot just focus on pursuing high economic growth when the
majority of the people are still poverty-stricken, less educated and less
capable. We as a country need to focus on our socioeconomic policies and
challenges before we can view ourselves as a hegemonic power in the SADC
region. Africa has its own challenges of poverty, low levels of productive
capacity, low capita income, low life expectancy, high infant mortality,
illiteracy, oppression of women and over-dependence on export earnings and
foreign capital, the list goes on, at the end of the day Africa has
suffered immensely to be independent. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, the concept of a
developmental state is difficult to agree upon. Suffice it to say that it
is generally used to mean a state that drives development in contrast to a
free market approach.

According to Chalmers Johnson, a US Asian scholar, a critical element in a
developmental state is its ability to mobilise a nation around economic
development within a capital system.

The big question to us today is to what extent does South Africa mobilise
the nation and neighbouring states to economic development? Is South Africa
able to maintain mass support through nationalist propaganda, improvements
in living standards for workers and businesses and increase employment as
well as paternalistic labour relations in large companies?

If the answer is yes to all the questions, then we are moving in the
direction of a developmental state, as defined by Lenin.

A developmental state has to answer the question why the countries of East
Asia are industrialised while other countries are trapped in poverty and
resource dependency.

For South Africa to get out of the cycle of poverty, the following have to
be done: Firstly, government departments and agencies should be provided
with a clear mandate to prioritise equitable employment-creating growth and
ensure that there is effective co-ordination around all programmes.
Secondly, government should export industries based on development of
domestic market and other government measures should be built. Thirdly, we
have to ensure the improvement of the quality of life of workers by
reducing the costs of basic necessities such as transport.

It is a given that the moral standing, the economic and military resources
of South Africa make it to look more or less like a hegemonic power in the
SADC region.

South Africa has the necessary characteristics of a hegemony as she has a
political and socioeconomic vision of the transitional environments and the
political willingness to implement such vision. I thank you. [Time
expired.]

Ms K R MAGAU: Chair, South Africa is a developmental state. The achievement
of democracy provided South Africans with an opportunity to pursue economic
growth, development and redistribution, so as to achieve a better life for
all.

Our vision of the economic base of a national democratic society is
characterised by, among others, a thriving and integrated economy that
draws on the creativity and skills that our whole population can offer,
building on South Africa’s economic endowment to create employment
opportunities for the benefit of all. It is also an economy that is
connected to the world - benefiting from vibrant trade relations with North
and South, and which is an integral part of a balanced regional economy
that contributes to the growing prosperity of Africa. Guided by the
preamble of our Constitution, we have committed ourselves to build a united
and democratic South Africa, able to take its rightful place as a sovereign
state in the family of nations.
SADC aims to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth and
socioeconomic development through efficient productive systems; deeper
integration and co-operation; good governance, and durable peace and
security in order for the region to emerge as a competitive and effective
player in international relations and the world economy.

Ours, therefore, is an interdependent region. The linkages among Southern
African states include formal and informal cross-boundary human and capital
movements; infrastructure networks, and shared natural resources. It is
this interdependence among Southern African states that must be exploited
for greater regional integration. We should also be mindful that Southern
African settler colonialism concentrated extraction and production mainly
in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Angola. Therefore, the three became the
principal poles of capital accumulation within the region, while
neighbouring states became labour reserves, servicing the labour needs of
the white settler colonies.

It is this understanding which enables South Africa to prioritise regional
integration. Therefore, current negotiations on economic partnership
agreements have the potential to reverse the gains we have achieved as a
region. These trade agreements we entered into between 1999 and 2002 – what
we call the Trade Development Co-operation Agreement, the TDCA - allowed us
to have access to the EU markets as much as they had access to our economy.
Realising that our economy is linked to that of the region, we have thus
taken a decision, as a country, to negotiate as a bloc. Whilst these
negotiations are going on, there are issues of dual membership that the
region has to deal with, which I have also alluded to. They came as a
result of colonial settlements.

The EU has sought to take advantage of such issues as well as the expiry
date of the Cotonou Agreement, which is 31 December 2007, to force us, as a
region, to agree on terms which are unfavourable to our future economic
development as a region, which is very important for us for the achievement
of a better life for all and all of our neighbours. Our region should not
allow this.

A number of African, Pacific and Caribbean states will find themselves in a
difficult trading environment with the EU if the 31 December 2007 deadline
still stands as the EU wishes. We are also told that there is no
alternative to the EPA negotiations which deadline is 31 December 2007.
Even though most parliaments will be in recess during that time for
ratification of such an agreement before the implementation of the new
agreement, the EU finds it impossible to change the deadlines.

We, therefore, urge the EU to accept that forcing us to agree with the EPA
outcomes that will be detrimental to ourselves and the region is
detrimental to a developmental state, as well as the region, which is busy
integrating itself. Therefore, South Africa, in the interest of the region
of which we are an integral part, must reject with contempt the suggestions
we have seen in the media recently that we, as a country, are blocking
economic partnership negotiation processes.

As a region, we have come a long way to where we are now. We also
understand our historical backgrounds and diversity. We should, however,
not allow the EU to defocus us from developing our region. We should not
allow the EU to push us to a point where we compromise each other’s
economies. Together we need to focus on accelerating our integration.
United we stand, but if we allow the EU to divide us, we will certainly
fall.

We must, in line with our African agenda, protect the unity of the
continent and refuse to negotiate alone in exclusion of the region. Even if
there are difficult challenges, we need to stand firm whilst working on
improving our intraregional trade disparities. Poverty and underdevelopment
is still prevalent in our region and in our country and the EU, in
possession of EPA negotiations, where they are attempting to also smother
the deadlocked Doha negotiations, must realise that that will be an
injustice to the majority of the people of our country and our region. We
should not agree to that. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, we might look at ourselves and say we are
progressive compared to countries in the SADC region, but we need to bear
in mind that we are still a fairly new democracy and before we are to lead
the way to democracy for our neighbours we need to first find our feet.

The MF has no objections to us being at the forefront on issues regarding
human rights and human development. In terms of the policy and our
Constitution, we are on firm footing. A close look certainly shall open our
challenges in applying policy and the chaos we have found ourselves in
since 1996. This chaos referred to does not imply that our current system
has failed, but rather that the legacy that we have been left with has been
extremely difficult to transform.

The MF believes that we do have a pivotal role to play in the development
of democracy and human rights on the continent. We feel that the mandate
for South Africa to run as a hegemonic power in the region remains the
mandate of our neighbours in consideration of the interest of all South
Africans.

The challenge of poverty on the continent is big and we need to find ways
as a new democracy to cross the borders of being classed as a developing
state to one of great power and strength. This will only be achieved if we
can overcome the strains of poverty and retardation and infiltrate the gap
that the powerhouses exhaust themselves with by keeping us out.

If the foreign debt can be written off on the continent as an incentive to
correcting the implications of colonialism, Africa would be placed in a
very progressive position on the map. We need to endorse a world conscience
on the debt of colonialism. This will pave our road to speeding up
development and then invite us to lead democracy in the SADC region. I
thank you.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chair, in the wake of third-wave democratisation and
neoliberal ascendancy, our conception of the developmental state must be
reconfigured. The PAC defines a developmental state as one that has a clear
commitment to a national development agenda and does so by including the
poorest majority and closing the widening gap between the rich and the
poor.

There are many reasons for creating a developmental state that places
greater concern on poverty eradication and social and economic liberation
of the poor African majority in particular. Extreme social inequality also
means that there must be an identity of interests between voters and
parties in this Parliament. This means that floor-crossing must be
abolished. It is not in the interest of the voters of our country, nor in
the interest of development and effective service delivery.

This kind of state must pursue economic integration into the global
economy. This it must achieve at its own pace, not at the behest of
international pressure. In the post-Washington Consensus era, there is a
renewed emphasis on institutional capacity and on states owning their own
national development strategies. It would therefore, be anachronistic for
South Africa to play a hegemonic role in the SADC countries. I thank you.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, the FD supports the idea of a developmental
state if by implication it suggests a caring state. A caring state upholds
the rights and privileges of its citizens to access state services that are
adequately resourced, easily accessible and available, duly responsive to
meet required needs and service objectives as well as efficiently and
effectively managed.

One of the basic conditions towards the implementation of a developmental
state is for government to improve on service delivery. It does not matter
if we call ourselves a developmental state when hospital beds are cut or
when the cost of living in South Africa is beyond the reach of the average
citizen. There is general concern that although South Africa has had stable
economic growth over the past decade there is still the need for an
economic miracle to lift our people from poverty and unemployment if you
want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2014.

Although we have had an average growth of around 3% to 5% over the past few
years, the current economic climate suggests that unless real disposable
income benefits are enjoyed by more and more people, very little turnaround
in the fortunes of poorer households will be attained by 2014. Most of the
poor are constrained by circumstances, which force them to rely too much on
state assistance, even though government has introduced mechanisms such as
Asgisa and the Jipsa programmes to empower the unskilled and the indigent.

Finally, a developmental state in the context of our country is one that
should redress economic and social inequalities through a blend of market
and social forces within a consolidating partnership framework including
government, business as well as civic bodies and institutions of higher and
further learning. I thank you.

Mr S SIMMONS: Chair, the concept of a developmental state is primarily
brought about by the urgent need to address, amongst others, poverty in
underdeveloped countries. It works with the assumption, according to
leading scholars, that the market can and will address the deliverance and,
therefore poverty challenges.

The challenge, therefore, is for the developmental state to become more
than a rhetorical concept, but a reality. It therefore begs the question
whether an even-handed ratio exists between what the market generates to
the state in the form of taxes and delivery to the masses, especially the
poorest of the poor.

Markets are most lucrative if conditions internally and externally are
favourable. We therefore have considered whether not only our domestic
market conditions allow for optimal state resources, but whether the
conditions of our subcontinental economic and political environment need an
overhaul.

The NA therefore believes that subcontinental customs regulations have to
be reviewed to allow for more streamlined economic and trade activities
within SADC. This, we believe, could lead to a greater flow of capital and
labour among member countries that would bring about greater revenue
resources to governments, which would allow for more poverty alleviation.
Also, skills specialisation and technological advancement can be achieved
in this way.

However, no matter how big the poverty alleviation resources pool is, the
ability to channel this to the poor remains the biggest challenge. We
therefore, above all, need to seek ways and means of how we will ensure
that the necessary skills are in place for the desired distribution
infrastructure to address poverty. Allow me to state that the magnitude of
this topic begs for greater deliberation than what is allowed for here
today. I thank you.

Mr S J F MARAIS: Chairperson, as we have already heard a couple of times
today, originally the meaning of a developmental state was linked to the
build-up and growth of Japan as an industrial nation after World War II,
which later was also linked to other Asian developing economies such as
Korea and Taiwan.

Chalmers Johnson, the American political scientist, explained the role of
the developmental state in the modern economy as follows:


 A state attempting to match the economic achievements of Japan must adopt
 the same priorities as Japan. It must first ... be a developmental state -
 and only then a regulatory state, a welfare state, an equality state, or
 whatever other kind of functional state a society we may wish to adopt.

Jac Laubscher, die groepekonoom van Sanlam, interpreteer dit dat ’n
ontwikkelingstaat op ’n enkeldoelwit gefokus is, naamlik om die hoogste
moontlike ekonomiese groeikoers te behaal. Die res, met inbegrip van die
verdeling van ekonomiese groeivoordele, moet hieraan onderworpe wees.
Laubscher beskryf in sy artikel “Die Suid-Afrikaanse ontwikkelingstaat:
mite of realiteit?” die eienskappe soos volg:


 [een,] ’n klein, maar elite-, meritokratiese burokrasie, wat die staat se
 nywerheidsbeleid formuleer en uitvoer. Die burokrasie ... word gemotiveer
 deur nasionale belang en nie eie belang nie ... [; twee,] ’n politieke
 stelsel wat aan die burokrasie genoeg ruimte gee om inisiatief te neem en
 effektief op te tree ... [; drie,] ... ’n leidinggewende organisasie [is
 nodig] wat beslag kan gee aan ... insentiewe vir die privaatsektor ...
 toegang tot insette waarborg, kapitaal op voorkeurbasis beskikbaar stel,
 risiko's verlaag, ’n entrepreneursvisie verskaf en konflik tussen
 ondernemings bestuur[; vier,] ’n unieke verhouding van interafhanklikheid
 en simbiose tussen die burokrasie en die privaatsektor [met] voordeel [vir
 albei; en laastens,] die vervolmaking van markkonformerende metodes van
 staatsinmenging. [Met] die ... fokus op uitvoere ... in die bevordering
 van ekonomiese groei ... veroorsaak [dit] dat staatsinmenging ...
 markondersteunend moet wees en nie markvervangend nie ...


   [Dit bevestig dat] die ontwikkelingstaat ... ’n bepaalde institusionele
   opset [impliseer] waarin die rol van ... die privaatsektor,
   deurslaggewend is.

Ooglopend geld bogenoemde nié in Suid-Afrika se geval nie, en het ons in
wese eerstens ’n herverdelende staat wat gefokus is op die transformasie
van die ekonomie en die samelewing, en tweedens ’n regulerende staat omdat
ons soveel kere spesifieke uitkomste wil bewerkstellig. Suid-Afrika is
duidelik nié ’n ontwikkelingstaat nie, en die staat se rol in ons
vryemarkekonomie moet eerder verder uitgedaag word. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Jac Laubscher, the group economist of Sanlam, interprets it as a
developmental state which is focused on a single goal, namely achieving the
highest possible economic growth rate. The rest, including the division of
economic growth advantages, must be subject to this. In his article “The
South African developmental state: myth or reality?”, Laubscher describes
these characteristics as follows:


   [one,] a small, but elite, meritocratic bureaucracy, which formulates and
   executes the state’s industrial policy. This bureaucracy ... is motivated
   by national interest and not self-interest ... [two,] a political system
   which provides the bureaucracy with enough space to use its own
   initiative and act effectively ... [; three,] an organisation which
   supplies leadership [is needed] to settle ... incentives for the private
   sector ... guarantee access to inputs, make capital available on a
   preferential basis, reduce risks, supply entrepreneurial vision and
   manage conflict between enterprises [; four,] a unique relationship of
   mutual dependency and symbiosis between the bureaucratic and private
   sector [with] advantages [for both; and lastly,] the perfection of market
   conforming methods of state intervention. [With] the ... focus on exports
   ... [this] means that state intervention ... should be market supporting
   and not market replacing ... in the promotion of economic growth ...


   [This confirms that] the developmental state ... [implies] a certain
   institutional arrangement in which the role of ... the private sector
   proves conclusive.

Obviously the above does not hold in South Africa’s case, and we
essentially have, firstly, a redistributive state focussed on the
transformation of the economy and society, and secondly, a regulating state
because we want to achieve specific results so many times. South Africa is
clearly not a developmental state, and the state’s role in our free market
economy should rather be challenged further.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, would the hon member care to
take a question?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Hon Marais, do you want to take a
question?

Mr S J F MARAIS: Chairperson, may I first finish?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): He wants to complete his speech
first, Deputy Minister.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Could you leave a minute at least to answer
my question?

Mnr S J F MARAIS: Beide die SAOG-state en die markte se tekortkominge moet
ondersoek word. Pragmatisme is belangrik en dit kry vele kere die oorhand
oor ideologie, en daar is baie voorbeelde daarvan in die wêreld. Dit moet
’n les wees waaruit ons moet leer sodat unieke Suider-Afrikaanse
ontwikkelingsmodelle geskep kan word vir ons unieke uitdagings en
omstandighede. Suid-Afrika is ook in ’n belangrike rol en posisie om wel
leiding te kan neem onder SAOG-lande en in die SA Ontwikkelingsgemeenskap.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr S J F MARAIS: Both the SADC states and the markets’ shortcomings should
be investigated. Pragmatism is important and many times it gets the upper
hand over ideology, and there are many examples of that across the world.
It should be a lesson we should learn from so that uniquely Southern
African developmental models can be created for our unique challenges and
circumstances. South Africa also has an important role and position to
supply leadership among SADC countries and in the Southern African
Development Community.]

Then South Africa can embrace its assigned role as the hegemonic power in
the SADC region.

Ek sluit af met die standpunt van die DA en my nasionale leier dat Suid-
Afrika en die SAOG kan ontwikkel en groei indien ons gemotiveerde burgers
het wat openlik vrye keuses kan maak en dat die staat die gemeenskap van
diens moet wees en nie andersom nie. Dit is van die kernwaardes van ’n open-
opportunity society. Ek dank u.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I conclude with the position of the DA and my national leader, that South
Africa and the SADC can develop and grow if we have motivated citizens who
can openly make free choices and if the state serves the community and not
the other way around. These are some of the core values of an open-
opportunity society. I thank you.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Hon Deputy Minister, do you want
to pose your question?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you very much, hon Chairperson.

Hon member, just an observation that you have cited both Japan ...
[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order! I must request you to put
the question, Deputy Minister.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Would the hon member agree or disagree that
the apartheid state was a quasi-developmental state that ensured the rapid
development, in particular for the Afrikaner and in general of the white
people of this country, and if you do agree, to say therefore the task of a
democratic developmental state is to address these imbalances created by an
apartheid state?

Mr S J F MARAIS: Chairperson, I do believe that the moment that you talk
about a developmental state, and obviously getting results from that
concept, you must look forward. And then you must ask yourself what you
will need to get to a developmental state.

We know that in the past many things have been done and there can be many
arguments whether they were developmental or not, but I do not think that
is the objective. I think one must look at the basic principles and say:
“We must look forward and at what is required to develop into a
developmental state. We must address those issues and forget about the
past.” Thank you very much. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, may I just say that we are very impressed with
the hon Deputy Minister’s interest in DA policy, etc, and if he would like
to attend our study groups so he can learn a bit more, he is very welcome
to do so. [Laughter.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order! That’s not a point of
order.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Chairperson, as the debate is
already unfolding, I want to welcome the DA’s shift because all along it
has been a believer in a free-market system and now it is indeed embracing
aspects of a developmental state. Unfortunately, in their embracing of the
developmental state argument, their ingredients are unfortunately
incorrect. I think there should be a debate, hon Deputy Minister, just to
engage on those fundamentals and theories underpinning that particular
debate because theirs are more liberal theories and ideologies. We need to
then engage on other democratic ones to ask ourselves as to what exactly is
working for South Africa.

I do not understand what exactly hon Stephens is saying. Earlier on, he
said that delivering free houses in itself is not developmental. Did he
visit the people to whom houses were delivered for the past two to four
years, and thus checked the qualitative change that has happened in their
lives with electricity and refrigerators in their houses? They are now able
to sell some frozen items from their houses. One cannot therefore say that
is not developmental in nature. It is developmental! [Applause.] I think he
is living in another South Africa that I don’t know where it is.
[Interjections.] We welcome the shift but the ingredients are wrong.
[Interjections.] Am I out of order, Chairperson?

Mr J J M STEPHENS: Chairperson, is the hon member prepared to take a
question? [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Are you prepared to take a
question, hon Bapela?
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Well, I will take questions towards
the end of my speech. Thank you. I therefore hope that the hon member comes
back to the real South Africa.

In characterising the international situation, the ANC in its strategy and
tactics of 1997 said the following:


   The ANC should aim to contribute to the restructuring of the
   international relations in the interest of the poor and this statement
   remains relevant as ever ...

It continued, and I quote –

   ... We are moved in this regard by the conviction that, as long as
   injustice, poverty and conflict exist anywhere on the globe, so long as
   humanity finds within itself individuals, movements and governments to co-
   operate in their eradication of such poverty, the ANC is proud to be part
   of these international forces.

The topic as tabled has four aspects to it and I will focus mainly on the
hegemonic power, whether South Africa should become one or not in the
interest of the region.

What is hegemonic power? I tried to look up what it could be. It is
described as the use of power, usually by those controlling the
metanarrative or masternarrative against the other.
Other explanations are that hegemony is a coercive control manifested
through direct force or its threat. It is also about power, ideology,
influence and knowledge, dominance of the ideas and coercion and cultural
dominance. “Hegemonic” describes the policies of states, which control or
bully those within their sphere of influence. Hegemonic power - the power
of hegemony - is primarily through coercion and consent.

These are but a few descriptions and definitions on hegemony and hegemonic
power. I raise all these points to later argue and respond to the question
raised, whether we should become a hegemonic power in the region or not.
Having that in mind, let us look at hegemonic behaviour and tendencies.

Firstly and fundamentally, hegemony is about raw, hard power. Militarily,
hegemonic capabilities are such that no other state has, the wherewithal,
to put up a serous fight against it.  Economically, hegemony occupies a
position of economic supremacy in the international system and enjoys a
preponderance of material resources and a key factor driving hegemonic
expansion.

Secondly, hegemony is about the dominant power ambitions - the purpose for
which it is to use its power. Hegemony acts self-interestedly to create a
stable international order that will safeguard its security and its
economic and ideological interests only.
Thirdly, hegemony is about polarity, because of its overwhelming advantages
in relative military and economic power.  Hegemony is the only great power
in the international system, which is, therefore by definition unipolar.

Fourthly, hegemony is about will. Not only must a hegemony possess
overwhelming power, it must purposefully exercise that power to impose
order on the international system. When it comes to grand strategy, a
hegemony practices the adage, “if you have got it, flaunt it” or as the USA
said during the Iraq invasion, “coalition of the willing” or “You are
either with us or against us”.

The philosophy and fundamentals concerning hegemony are about structural
change, because if one state achieves hegemony, the system ceases to be
anarchic and becomes hierarchic. Of course, as Robert Gilpin has noted:

   No state has complete control over an international system, and thus
   hegemony is a relative, not an absolute concept.


When a great power attains hegemony, as for example the USA did in Western
Europe after World War II, it means that the system is more hierarchic -
and less anarchic - than it would be in the absence of hegemonic power.

Implicit in Gilpin’s observation that hegemony is a relative concept is
subtle but important although the USA is not omnipotent. Although the US is
the most powerful international actor today since imperial Rome, there
clearly are limits to its ability to shape international outcomes.

The USA has been unable to suppress the insurgency in Iraq, just as it did
not prevail in the Vietnam War and unable to compel either North Korea or
Iran to halt their nuclear programmes. Does this mean the US is not an
extra regional or global hegemony after all? Clearly not - at least not -
if we understand what power is and what it is not. As Kenneth Waltz has
pointed out: “Power does not mean the ability to get one’s way all the
time.”

Material resources never translate fully into desired outcomes - a point
acknowledged by military strategists that when they observe that the enemy
has a vote in determining the degree to which one’s own strategic goal will
be realised. Rather, a state is powerful if it gets its way most of the
time than others do, precisely because the US is an extra regional hegemony
- a marked asymmetry of influence which favours it. In international
politics, the US does not get all that it wants all the time. But, it gets
most of what it wants an awful lot of time and it affects other states far
more than states affect it.

Having defined in a very scientific and philosophical argument about what
hegemony is, we in the ANC, reject any notion or thinking that South Africa
is a hegemony. Hence, each time in international forums, we do stand and
argue against insinuations, such as big brother, the power of the South,
the regional power, a bully or imperialist power of Africa, which
unfortunately are being ascribed without care and consideration.

One is a hegemony only if one uses the power of one’s economy, the relative
military power and if one coerces, forces and dominates, imposes and
controls in such a way that one becomes a unilateralist. That is not the
agenda or parts of any of our foreign policies in this country and not in
the democratic South Africa.

Yes, probably under apartheid we saw such hegemony, of bombing neighbours,
in Lesotho, Botswana, Mozambique, and in Zambia under the guise of fighting
the so-called terrorists or stopping the expansion functions of the
communists. It forced others into agreements, such as the Nkomati Accord
and or the Mbabane Agreements, sponsoring and supporting civil wars in
Mozambique and Angola. Apartheid South Africa was a bully and hegemonic
power in the region. At that point, if one would ask the question whether
South Africa should be called a hegemonic state, I would have agreed but
not this democratic South Africa.

In the democratic South Africa values and principles of international co-
operation are underpinned by multilateralism in international affairs and
proactive engagement in conflict management. Multilateralism is a concept
of foreign policy and is therefore based on collaboration as opposed to
competition.

Countries that pursue multilateral foreign policies avoid acting
unilaterally and are generally opposed to foreign policies based on
dominance. They tend to preoccupy themselves with issues such as the reform
of international institutions, greater collaboration between North and
South and a South-South co-operation. Theirs is a vision of an inclusive-
based international system that is not discriminatory and where compromise
is the norm. South Africa, our country, can safely be placed within that
category of countries.

At the same time, in the field of conflict management, which is the other
pillar of South Africa’s Foreign policy, the country is becoming
increasingly bold and assertive. Despite our commitment to acting within a
framework of multilateralism, we have not shied away from taking the lead
in offering dynamic and pragmatic solutions to some of the most intractable
conflicts on the continent.

What is happening in the Doha Round of negotiations, in the G20 countries
and in the EPA’s negotiations, as alluded to by my colleagues, is that
South Africa participates and contributes to those collectives and we are
not bullying anybody. We contribute ideas for solutions and we look at the
benefits of the collectives that benefit everybody.

Responding to the question whether South Africa becomes a hegemonic power
in the interest of the region. Our response is no. It cannot be, it shall
not be, and shall never be, but it will remain a regional player within a
collaborative system of international agreements.

We must as a regional player enable our neighbours and the continent to
grow their economies, assist them to address the challenges that they are
facing, like the infrastructure, grow our own regional market as SADC
within the regional economic communities’ programme. I hope therefore, that
the hon Ben Skosana will agree with that approach.

Noting also that our economy has expanded into the region and the
continent, our strength and capacity gives us advantages as far as
manufacturing is concerned. However, we have an obligation in the region to
see to it that other member states produce goods that can also find their
way into our markets and trade in South Africa. We also want to see an
increase in trade amongst member states within the region.

In conclusion, it is not in the interest of South Africa to become a
hegemonic power. I think I have described what hegemonic power is and what
is a hegemony. It is a senseless and heartless type of an activity or
behaviour. We do not want to become that. We can still pursue our national
interests through multilateral as the order of the new world that we are
striving to build. As the ANC we clearly state that we want a just and
equitable world order and that just and equitable world order is possible.
And, we must strive to build it. Amandla! [Applause.]

Mr J J M STEPHENS: Chairperson, the hon member said he will take a
question.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Okay, proceed.

Mr J J M STEPHENS: I would like to know from the hon member whether he has
ever taken the trouble to visit the people who were given houses and then
thrown out of those houses? They lost them because they couldn’t afford to
live in a house because they had no jobs? [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Well, I don’t know of any cases
where people were thrown out of houses. I think there is an issue here and
I want to explain that issue. The issue is that there are houses that are
given to people for free. There is a category of those houses, if you are
not aware; those are called “RDP houses”. So, you cannot throw out a person
who has been given a free house to live in. Then municipalities have what
we call indigence programmes so that those people who are unemployed at
that particular moment can go and apply for indigence and a consideration
would be given. [Interjections.]

Government has been discouraging those people who after getting a house and
then selling it to somebody else, to stop that. That is where we have to
ensure that those things do not happen because we give those houses on the
basis that people need them and therefore they will be able to grow and
develop themselves. [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, hon members, the well-known definition of a
developmental state as developed by Chalmers Johnson, which is premised on
his seminal analysis of Japan’s very rapid and highly successful post-war
reconstruction and reindustrialisation has to be juxtaposed with our own
uniquely South African home-made definition that will bear characteristics
of who we are, where we come from and where were are going to.

According to Johnson, a developmental state is the one that determines and
influences the direction and pace of economic development by directly
intervening in the development process rather than relying on the unco-
ordinated influence of free markets or market forces. Even if we agree with
Johnson’s definition, ours will have to be expanded to include an element
of what one may call African humanism.

Indeed, I agree with hon Njikelana that South Africa is actually a
developmental state in the making, but any development ideology that we
seek to follow will have to be in touch with the African reality. Basil
Davidson teaches us very clearly regarding this, that instead of building
new states from the foundation culture of Africa’s pre-colonial states,
Africa tried to build new states from the foundation culture of colonial
states. So, African independence had not been able to join in its own
history and tradition.

The whole of the African continent is in the third phase of the struggle
for economic liberation and development. No African country right now has
won its economic struggle against poverty; and economic emancipation and
development is the most important phase in our liberation struggle. Africa
can never be free unless it has achieved economic freedom, and that is a
given fact.

Political freedom cannot be sustained on an empty stomach whilst holding
out the desperate and humiliating hands of begging. We can never be free
unless we have overcome our personal poverty and achieved financial
success. But, let us get this very straight: The Asian Tigers and China
followed development pathways that did not conform to the Washington
Consensus doctrine of free markets. It can be argued here that perhaps that
is why they are what they are today.

The destruction of our African values as a result of colonialism accounts
for many of Africa’s ongoing economic problems. Africa borrowed wrong
things from the West. Africa borrowed even the wrong components of
capitalism. It also borrowed the profit motive, not actually the
entrepreneurial spirit. We borrowed even the acquisitive appetites of
capitalism, not its creative risk-taking.

Our kind of capitalism right now assumes that human beings are primarily
economic beings. It assumes that human beings will always act so as to
pursue their own rational self-interest. In business terms, these
principles are mirrored by the pursuit of profits for its own sake and by
the assumption that every business exists to maximise its own self-
interest. At least, George Soros agrees with me, regarding this.

Poverty as we know it has many faces; one of them is intellectual poverty
which has allowed for inappropriate development strategies that are
inconsistent with our African culture. We need to ensure that there is an
integration of our African belief systems, thought and culture. History
shows that significant societal transformation has to be strictly and
correctly accompanied by our guided and developed African Renaissance.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order! Hon member, your time has
expired.

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, we hope that the ruling party will actually
take the debate on the developmental state forward, because it seems to be
a very interesting debate. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 16:36.
