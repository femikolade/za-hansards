                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms A N T MCHUNU: I hereby move:

   That the Council –


      1) congratulates young maidens of South Africa who are celebrating the
         Reed Dance at Enyokeni Royal Palace, Nongoma, over the week-end of
         6 to 8 September 2007;

         the spread of deadly diseases;


      3) expresses its appreciation for their voluntary stand to work with
         their mothers and continue with virginity testing, despite world
         pressure on them to get deflowered and then provide a market for
         condoms and chemical contraceptives at a young, tender and immature
         age; and


      4) notes that loading a child’s body’s with drugs exposes the body
         system to infections and resistance to drugs.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

    READINESS OF PROVINCES TO DEAL WITH DISASTERS CAUSED BY FIRES AND THE
                               IMPACT THEREOF

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We now proceed to the subject for discussion
today on the readiness of provinces to deal with disasters caused by fires
and the impact thereof. We have invited the Minister for Provincial and
Local Government. We welcome you, Minister, and your deputy. Thank you very
much for coming.

All of you are aware that this is a very current and important issue. We
have a few MECs with us. Thanks for coming, MEC Mashego-Dlamini from
Mpumalanga; MEC from the Western Cape, Mr Dyantyi. I thought all MECs would
be here today, because of the importance of the subject. Thank you to the
special delegates also for making it to this important discussion.

Minister, just before you take your place, we have decided in the Council
that once a quarter, we will pick a topic for discussion, not just on
provincial and local government issues, but on many other issues also. We
have already had education. We missed the last quarter, but are now doing
the provincial and local government issues. There is another subject coming
and we can discuss to what extent government is prepared. With agreement
between you and me, we thought it would be much better to focus on the one
today so that we have that valuable input for the subject today.

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, hon MECs,
Deputy Minister Nomatyala Hangana, and hon members, on behalf of the
Ministry and the Department of Provincial and Local Government, I would
like to take this opportunity to express our debt to you for seeing fit to
organise this debate.

This debate offers us the welcome opportunity to reflect on the readiness
of provinces to deal with disasters caused by fires and the impact thereof.
Not only does this debate deal with a matter that bears on the untold human
suffering caused either by the elements or by human activities which are
not benign to the environment, but also, it is about a problem which
reaches deep into the economy of our country.

The fires at the end of July and beginning of August in Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-
Natal, Free State, Eastern Cape,  Limpopo  and  Gauteng  had  a  devastating
impact on the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  our  people.  Amongst  the  many
casualties that we as a nation have suffered in the wake of those fires  are
the 20 men and women whose passing we deeply regret.  We  hereby  offer  our
sincere and heartfelt sympathy and  condolences  to  their  loved  ones.  We
further offer our sympathies to those of our people who have lost  property,
plantation, crops, grazing land, livestock and game as well as  those  whose
lives and livelihoods have been negatively impacted by these fires.

As we speak, the relevant national sector departments, provincial
departments, municipalities and private entities are working very hard to
make a precise determination of the extent of the damage caused by this
disaster. Early indications of the damage and losses include the following:
As much as 100 000 hectares of forestry and commercial plantations, and a
further 22 700 hectares in Swaziland, as well as over 200 000 hectares of
grazing land have been lost; loss of an as-yet-unknown number of stock and
commercial game species, and other species; environmental damage, including
soil erosion and the fires facilitating the spread of invasive alien
plants; four sawmills and as-yet-undetermined numbers of houses and
buildings were damaged or destroyed; the potential loss of an as-yet-
unquantified number of existing and future jobs; loss of foreign exchange
and revenue, and the psychological displacement and loss of productive time
impacts during and after the fires.

It bears emphasising that had it not been for  the  decisive  and  dedicated
toil of the Disaster Management Centres, the cadres of the Working  on  Fire
programme, the SANDF,  local  councils,  fire  protection  associations  and
other  structures,  the  losses  and  the  damage  could  have   been   more
staggering. In Mpumalanga alone, the Working on Fire programme  provided  32
fire-fighting aircraft, including four air force helicopters,  to  fight  40
fires, flying over 700 hours. Three hundred-and-seventy  fire-fighters  from
Working on Fire, and mopping-up support from 105 Working for  Water  workers
fought the  fires.  In  addition,  capacities  from  local  government,  the
commercial forestry industry and the agricultural sector were mobilised  and
deployed.

In a letter written to my colleague,  the  Minister  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry, and copied  to  me,  the  executive  director  of  Forestry  South
Africa, Mr Edwards, takes the view that had it not been for the  Working  on
Fire programme, the damage could have reached catastrophic  proportions.  Mr
Edwards actually makes a counterfactual deduction to  the  effect  that  the
Working on Fire programme may have saved the country well over R1 billion.

We are currently undertaking a detailed damage assessment.  Co-ordinated  by
the National Disaster Management  Centre,  this  process  involves  all  the
affected provinces, municipalities and national sector departments. The  aim
is to determine the steps that need to be taken to normalise the  situation.
We also intend to identify priority interventions required across the  three
spheres of government and the private sector. Lastly, we intend to  quantify
the  extent  of  damage  incurred  by  all  stakeholders  with  a  view   to
identifying those amongst them that may require  and/or  deserve  provincial
or national government assistance.

Once the damage assessment has been completed, then a  post-disaster  review
will be undertaken. The intention is to identify best practices  which  must
be taken on  board  as  we  establish  new  benchmarks  for  organising  our
disaster prevention and mitigation readiness into the future.

As we all know, the first step towards fighting disasters  is  to  make  the
issue itself a national priority. In this regard, we are proud to  say  that
the necessary legal and regulatory  structures  are  already  in  place.  We
require steadiness of purpose on the part of all  stakeholders.  All  of  us
must work together to turn regulations into effective  practices.  In  their
development  planning,  all  spheres  of  government  must  treat   disaster
prevention and mitigation as a subject for  serious,  sustained  action. The
private sector and the academic community must consciously be  part  of  the
national effort toward maintaining the natural resource base upon  which  we
depend for our continued economic development.

The generality of the South African population must take responsibility  for
preserving the ability of the biotic community to meet  the  needs  of  both
present and future generations. All these things will happen  if,  and  only
if, we redouble our efforts  to  mobilise  for  enforcement  of  our  legal,
regulatory and institutional mechanisms. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S SHICEKA: Chairperson, Minister, Deputy Minister, MEC present from the
Western Cape, Qubudile, and MEC from Mpumalanga, Mama uCandith, special
delegates present, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, comrades and friends,
today I feel very privileged to stand before you to share views about a
most important topic that is, however, underrated, which is disaster
management, and specifically dealing with fires.

Capitalism is a system that encourages individual accumulation of wealth,
and this wealth is at times reflected through property ownership,
individually and collectively, in the form of a state. Disasters arise from
both natural and human causes. They are inevitable and we do not know when
and where they will happen. Disasters are always unpredictable; hence,
their worst effects can be partially or completely prevented by
preparation, early-warning systems and decisive response.

South Africa as a country has developed one of the best models for disaster
management and the prevention thereof. Our model of disaster management
involves preparation, support, and the rebuilding of society when natural
or man-made disasters occur. In general, any emergency management is the
continuous process by which all individuals, groups and communities manage
hazards in an effort to avoid the impact of disasters resulting from the
hazards.

The launch of the White Paper on Disaster Management, and the passing of
the Act thereon is but one of the most important pieces of legislation that
correctly outlines government’s new thinking in relation to disaster
management. The recent disasters related to shack fires, particularly in
the Western Cape, and veld fires, emphasise the importance of this
legislation.

In line with international trends, priority is given to the prevention of
disasters. Unlike previous efforts, our model places emphasis on the
importance of preventing or mitigating human, economic and property losses,
and avoiding environmental degradation. Although preparedness and measures
for more efficient rescue operations will remain a necessity, much greater
attention is directed to the introduction of preventative strategies.

Previously, the plight of the most vulnerable sections of our population
was ignored and the very cause of their vulnerability - that of poverty –
was obscured. In line with government’s priorities, our new approach to
disaster management pays specific attention to the pressing needs of poor
communities in relation to both natural and human disasters. The new
approach is in keeping with the government’s commitment to alleviate the
plight of the poor communities through its national efforts in poverty
reduction, land reform, housing, employment creation and service expansion
and delivery.

Disaster management is furthermore not the exclusive preserve of
government. The private sector and civil society need to play a crucial
role in ensuring that there are sustainable and effective methods of
ensuring that disasters are managed, and that we are able to take these
programmes in partnership and in co-operation with all those that are on
board.

We need to strengthen the capacities within and across municipalities to
record and track disaster-related impacts to better inform both disaster
management and development planning. Moreover, in an effort to minimise
fire-related incidents and disasters, free training in fire safety needs to
be provided to the community, meaning that we need to mobilise our people.
Government has developed policies that are in place; now we need to ensure
that structures are established.

However, it is not only the structures that need to be established. We also
need to ensure that during the development of the independent development
plans, and all other planning-related systems and programmes, disaster
management is part of that, and at the core of that. The mobilisation and
capacitating of our communities is supposed to be at the core of this so
that our people are able to ensure that they develop strategies that can
have early-warning systems, but not only that; they must be able to ensure
that they deal with this matter on their own.

As all of us know, rural municipalities do not have the capacity to deal
with disasters at this level. Therefore, we need to make an extra effort to
involve our people in dealing with these issues, so that our people, on
their own, are able to take up the cudgels of this process, and deal with
it in a way that ensures that the indigenous knowledge systems are taken on
board in doing so.

We believe that the role of community development workers is supposed to be
at the centre of this mobilisation process so that they play a role in
educating our communities about veld fires and also about the impact of
smoking and dropping the cigarette stubs in dry areas. People must be
trained in basic first aid and in dealing with fires. They must also be
trained on the dangers of building houses in unsafe areas, and the dangers
of paraffin as a form of energy that is utilised by our people in our
communities.

One of the most important programmes that has been developed by the
paraffin industry is the “Ufudo” campaign. This campaign is aimed at
conscientising and building the consciousness and education of the people
who live in informal settlements. This campaign is aimed at mobilising our
people so that they are able to deal with these things, particularly when
they deal with primus stoves, paraffin lamps and also the candles that
sometimes are dangerous when they are utilised in these areas.

People from informal settlements, we believe, must also be educated about
leaving enough empty space in-between so that fire engines are able to move
in these areas, so that when one shack is burning, it does not affect the
shacks around it. We believe that these matters are matters that must be
taken up, and are matters that must be liaised upon in a way that takes us
forward in this respect.

I want to conclude in the time I have left by saying that all of us must be
soldiers who are beginning to ensure that they build this consciousness in
our society about the importance of disaster management in general, and of
fire management in particular, as these issues affect the whole of the
country and they affect the livelihood of our people, and therefore, they
need to be combated by all of us. We must be at the forefront, as
legislators, in this process of educating our people, particularly in rural
areas. Thank you.

Mr A WATSON: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs and hon fellow members
of the NCOP, research shows that most regions in South Africa are naturally
fire-prone, and the inherent fire hazards are exacerbated by a number of
factors, not least of which is the escalating occurrence of alien plant
invasions coupled with the ever-present fire risks associated with forestry
and agriculture. This is particularly prevalent in a province like my own,
Mpumalanga, with vast areas of forestry in the escarpment areas and
alongside it thousands of hectares of grassed areas and grazing fields.

Fires will always be part of our lives and the natural ecological role of
fire must be recognised and never underestimated, but the devastating fires
of the recent past, particularly in Mpumalanga, the Eastern Cape, Limpopo
and other provinces have had a very negative effect on all spheres of life
in those provinces.

On 7 August, barely a month ago, Sappi announced that they alone were
negatively affected on no less than 4 300 hectares of forested land in the
Sabie and Graskop areas, and considering the slow production of timber,
this will not only set back the industry for many years, but will also
cause a severe shortage of timber in the foreseeable future. The consequent
job losses and effect on dependent families can only be imagined.

Councillor Ernst van den Berg, who serves both on the Emakhazeni Local
Municipality and the Ekangala District Municipality reports that the veld
fire of 15 August that swept through the farms between Wonderfontein and
Carolina in Mpumalanga not only destroyed many hectares of grazing, but
also resulted in the emergency culling of no fewer than 600 sheep and 40
head of cattle – all prime breeding stock, which included some top-class
dairy cows. In the same area, just weeks before, two tourists were burned
to death when a trout farm and holiday resort was unexpectedly engulfed in
a raging fire in which many animals were also killed, and in which
buildings, vehicles and implements were destroyed.

The obvious and highly evident effects of fires out of control are easy to
reflect upon, and even easier to raise to the level of newsworthiness, but
the negative impact on farm dwellers, particularly the families of
farmworkers and the rural poor, cannot be overstated. Just think of the
loss of housing and possessions when thatched or wooden dwellings ignite
and, worst still, the loss of life and disability.

Of equal importance is the knock-on effect on rural economies. A survey of
flower and thatch harvesting of natural plant resources in the fynbos in
1993 showed that the value of these products amounted to more than R65
million per year, and sustained 20 000 to 30 000 rural people in
subsistence livelihoods. While no accurate current value is available, this
survey reported that it is reliably estimated that the value of this
industry, to the rural poor, is now at least R120 million a year.

Time does not permit me to reflect on other effects like air pollution and
the inhalation of smoke particles, but all these occurrences re-emphasise
the vital need for an integrated approach to fire management in all the
affected regions. Research in my own province has revealed that whilst a
disaster management unit does indeed exist, and while excellent work is
being done by the Working on Fire programme, such as during the recent
terrible fires, evidence of input from the side of government – both local
and provincial – has been minimal and mostly of a short-term nature during
crises.

Often, when communities and individuals have been negatively affected by
fires, they are soon assisted with blankets, tents and food parcels to
render temporary and emergency relief. However, no provisions seem to be in
place for long-term assistance and support to such victims.

The impact of such disasters and the consequential needs of the affected
communities and individual victims are also not always properly assessed.
There is evidence of hundreds of blankets being distributed to people who
have sufficient shelter, blankets and clothing, but who are in dire need of
feed and fodder for their animals.

During March this year, my colleagues in the legislature submitted
questions in regard to fire services in Mpumalanga municipalities, and in
the reply by the MEC for Local Government and Housing, they were informed
that, presently, only 17 fire brigades serve the entire province. This is
obviously a hopelessly inadequate situation, because some of these
communities are 50km or more away from the nearest fire brigade.

Many other things can be said about disasters, but I want to say – in
closing – that the recent devastations referred to and similar occurrences
of previous years are proof enough, if proof is needed, that a
comprehensive plan must not only be compiled, but must be urgently
implemented.

Therefore, on behalf of the DA in this House, I propose that this subject
becomes a priority oversight item on the programmes of the next provincial
visits by delegations, and that the NCOP embarks on a national
investigation and, ultimately, produces a report which clearly outlines
vital steps to be taken to implement effective and operational disaster
management units in all provinces. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms K C MASHEGO-DLAMINI (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, hon Ministers and Deputy
Ministers who are present here, hon members of the NCOP and delegates from
various provinces, it is a great honour and prestige to be accorded this
opportunity to address this august House on such an important matter. We
are coming out of the fire disaster-prone season at the end of August,
which has left a number of areas in the country in ashes.

Our province was, however, not an exception to such occurrences, as it had
its share of the disaster from 27 July to 16 August 2007. The severity of
the fire disaster has left at least 13 people dead, 26 injured, 222 houses
destroyed, 157 structures damaged, about 50 000 hectares of plantation and
2 500 hectares of grazing land destroyed and almost 1 000 animals and
livestock killed. Further sporadic incidences of blazing fires were
reported in the veld and forest farms beyond 16 August. Around five o’clock
yesterday morning, 15 shacks and two cars were destroyed at Sabie.

It is, however, worth mentioning that Cabinet took an interest in the
matter and has sent the Minister for Provincial and Local Government and
the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry. The visits by the Ministers
were followed up by the Premier of the province and some members of the
Provincial Executive Council to distribute disaster relief to the affected
communities on 3 August 2007. The visits were conducted in collaboration
with the Gift of the Givers Foundation that was generously donating food
parcels, tents, blankets, clothes and other goods. The last visit was made
by the members of the NCOP from our province, which we greatly appreciate.
[Applause.]

Whilst the visits were taking place, the departments of local government
and housing and other sector departments provided an immediate response
following the inferno. The construction of temporary housing structures and
provision of humanitarian aid were among the immediate dispersed measures.
Other departments assisted in providing the assessment of damages in their
field of expertise.

In dealing with the situation, the province was guided by the following
three important pieces of legislation: the National Veld and Forest Fire
Act of 1998, the Fire Brigade Services Act of 1987, and the Disaster
Management Act of 2002.

According to Forestry SA, the fires and associated damages caused to
commercial forests is a five-fold increase on the last 25 years’ average
and this will take decades to recover from. Estimates indicate a loss of
about R3,5 million and that damages of commercial areas affected totalled
9,92% of the provincial forested area covering a range of related sectors.

Through the 2006 statistics, we are made aware that out of the
approximately 1 281 521 hectares occupied by forestry in the country,
almost 521 385 hectares are in Mpumalanga, which is 40,7%. In terms of the
areas that have been burnt in the whole country – 63 964 hectares –
Mpumalanga has experienced a burnt forestry of 47 760 hectares, which is
74,7% of the disaster in forestry.

Having said that, Forestry SA has further requested assistance in view of
this disaster to be exempted from paying property rates in forestry where
such fire disaster occurred - exemption will be for a specific
consideration period as may be acceptable to the Minister and the relevant
local municipalities. The second request was for exemption from surcharges
on water supplied beyond the normal water allocation quotas. This exemption
will only be applicable for a specific period of recovery for plantations
and to put wood logs under irrigation for a certain period.

As for the Department of Agriculture, more than 45 farms were seriously
affected in the province, because their livestock and agricultural
equipment and commercial buildings were largely lost to the blazes. More
than 25 hectares of grazing land has been lost. The provincial cabinet of
Mpumalanga has allocated R16 million – you must listen to this, Mr Watson –
to supply all the livestock farmers with fodder to enable them to feed the
little bit of livestock that remained.

The Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs administration has estimated
a total loss of R253 million. This costs estimate can be expected to change
if new sporadic fires emerge and an updated report is submitted. It goes
without saying that the province has suffered an immense economic
catastrophe through these fire disasters. Most of our active labour force
will be left unemployed due to economic cutbacks in the agriculture and
forestry industries.

Following the fire disaster, the Department of Local Government has come up
with plans to further improve disaster management in the province. The
department is finalising the process of a compliant Provincial Disaster
Management Framework. The department is negotiating capacitated local
municipalities in the three districts to sign a service level agreement for
the 24-hour service of the Provincial Disaster Management Centre as a
temporary measure for their current facilities until the completion of the
Provincial Disaster Management Centre. Further negotiations will unfold
with the Working on Fire agency to second and deploy some of its
firefighters to distressed municipalities.

A declaration of commitment and partnership was signed between the
department and the Gift of the Givers Foundation as an NGO so that we can
join hands when such occurrences happen in our province again. The province
has compiled a consolidated assessment report for approval by the
Provincial Executive Council – which has been done yesterday – and this
report will be submitted to the National Disaster Management Centre.

The centre will clarify the disaster in terms of section 23 of the Disaster
Management Act, which will provide a direction whether a provincial or
local disaster should be declared in the province. The declaration of the
disaster, whether at local or provincial level, will necessitate
extraordinary steps and measures towards recovery and rehabilitation.

We are, however, quite confident that with the current process for the
construction of the fully equipped, state-of-the-art Provincial Disaster
Management Centre the following can be achieved with ease in a very short
space of time: Farmers will be monitored for compliance with the Act by
ensuring that fire-breaks are consistently done; we are considering
reviving fire protection associations for all veld, farm and forest areas;
we are considering all our municipalities being fully equipped and having
adequate and relevant human resources for firefighting; there will be a
submission of the report from the category of authorised persons, detailing
the gaps in the fire stations of municipalities; we will also pursue the
report on the findings of the current investigation into the causes of fire
that was instituted by our department from the second week of August 2007.

A report with findings and recommendations is due to be submitted to the
department by mid-September; it is also about time that we ensure that
there are credible disaster plans and contingencies in the province,
including all municipalities. The IDP engagement process will also assist
to jack up our quality in this field. Cabinet yesterday seconded the
decision that all assessments of the fire damage from all stakeholders need
to be submitted to the provincial office by 2 September 2007.

We are confident that should all these be realised, the persistent blazing
fires engulfing the province over the past few years will soon be history.
We will continue to work with Working on Fire, the SANDF and other
stakeholders in providing speedy responses where necessary.

I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

[Ms A N T  MCHUNU:  Hon  Chairperson,  allow  me  to  express  my  heartfelt
gratitude to the Minister who has  had  to  deal  with  this  sad  state  of
events, as well as all other hon members who responded  when  this  incident
occurred; it is very sad indeed. If one listens to them  talking  about  the
deceased and property which has been destroyed, one feels very  sad.  We  do
appreciate all their efforts.]

Fire disasters have a huge impact on human beings, the environment and
agriculture and as such they require a high level of government
intervention. Though many of these fire disasters are unpredictable their
worst effects can be partially or completely prevented by preparation,
early warning and swift decisive responses.

The recent tragic fires last July that were defined by the KwaZulu-Natal
MEC for Agriculture and Environmental Affairs as a catastrophe highlighted
a lack of preparedness by provinces to manage fire disasters. During the
fires, many victims battled to access emergency medical treatment. As a
result the fires claimed as many as 17 lives. Nearly 1 000 people also lost
their homes and everything they owned.

The response from private firefighting and the Provincial Disaster
Management Centre was very crucial, although it highlighted the
government’s lack of firefighting capacity and emergency services in rural
areas.

The IFP notes with dismay that whenever there is a disaster the response is
always weak from local government. It is very clear that the response to
fires in rural areas needed national, provincial and local government
attention.

In response to the KZN fires, one of the rural metro emergency service
directors has this to say: “The cities have five-star fire services, but in
rural areas - more than 80% of South Africa - there is practically nothing,
so they are always hit the hardest. Alternative options are needed to
ensure that firefighters get out there and help people in time.”

Droughts and veld fires fall under the LandCare Programme as well. The
Drought Grant was stopped in the 2005-06 financial year. This grant should
be re-introduced to cover rural and farming communities, since it is
drought which often leads to uncontrollable fires. Forests, just like
homesteads, need to be clearly demarcated so that veld fires do not spread
to these areas.
Furthermore, measures to reduce the consequences of wild fires such as
preparedness and contingency plans, wild fire recovery plans, community
education programmes for self-protection of lives and property and building
restrictions and standards for areas prone to veld fires, must be in place.

I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Adjunkminister, agb LUR’e teenwoordig, lede van die Nasionale Raad van
Provinsies in hierdie hoogwaardige Huis, kollegas en vriende, laat my toe
om eerstens ons verskoning namens die LUR vir die Noord-Kaap, die agb Van
Wyk, aan die Huis te bring in sy afwesigheid hier vanweë dringende sake van
die provinsie. Dit het dit vir hom onmoontlik gemaak om hier te wees, en hy
het my gevra om deel te neem aan hierdie debat. Ek doen dit met groot
nederigheid en met die nodige agting en respek wat dit verdien. Geagte
Voorsitter, ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C A T SMITH (Northern Cape): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy
Minister, hon MECs present, members of the National Council of Provinces in
this august House, colleagues and friends, allow me firstly to tender an
apology to this House on behalf of the MEC for the Northern Cape, the hon
Van Wyk, who is absent as a result of urgent provincial matters. These have
made it impossible for him to be here and he has asked me to participate in
this debate.  This I do with absolute humility and with the necessary
regard and respect that it requires. Hon Chairperson ...]

... it is crucial that, in the country’s disaster management, a specific
grant is made available for disaster management. This will enable
municipalities to have dedicated capacity, both in terms of staff and
equipment, for disaster management. It will also assist provinces and
municipalities to comply with the Disaster Management Act.

The matter of paying stipends to volunteers needs serious attention,
especially in remote towns of municipalities.

Due to the fact that the firefighting services, especially fully equipped
trucks, are very expensive and out of financial reach for small Category B
municipalities, interactions should take place. We’ll have the SANDF and
ACSA to look into availing those firefighting trucks to these
municipalities for use.

Dit is ook noodsaaklik dat daar groter samewerking onder ander
belangegroepe sal plaasvind, spesifiek in rampsituasies. Dis van kardinale
belang.

Gedurende `n ramp in die Noord-Kaap in Kgalagadi, het 40 000 hektaar veld
afgebrand. Gedurende daardie tyd het dit vir ons drie dae gevat om te kom
onderhandel met die Suid Afrikaanse Nasionale Weermag om die helikopter in
die lug te kry om daardie veldbrand te probeer help.

De Beers, op sy beurt, het vinniger `n helikopter beskikbaar gestel. Daarom
is dit noodsaaklik dat ons hierdie samewerking bewerkstellig. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is also necessary that there should be greater co-operation between
other stakeholders, especially in disaster situations. This is of utmost
importance.

In a disaster at Kgalagadi in the Northern Cape, 40 000 hectares of veld
were destroyed in a fire. During that time, it took us three days to
negotiate with the SA National Defence Force to get the helicopter airborne
to assist in the efforts to extinguish that blaze.

De Beers, in its turn, was much quicker at making a helicopter available.
That is why it is necessary for us to bring about this co-operation.]

Hon Chairperson, the types of disasters which occurred in the Northern Cape
are those of motor vehicle accidents, train accidents, domestic fires, veld
fires - as I have indicated, particularly one of 15 000 hectares and 19 000
hectares - hazmat cases, including anthrax and bomb scares, cholera cases
in the Vaal River were also reported. The Provincial Disaster Management
Centre is not fully operational. This is due to the fact that a decision at
national level to purchase equipment for all provinces from Switzerland has
not been accepted. The province is now in the process of facilitating the
purchase of equipment in order for the centre to be fully operational.

In two years we have not been able to retain the two provincial disaster
managers, but we are in the process of recruiting a new manager. The PDMC
has been operational, although in the last financial year the approach to
membership has changed.

The new approach has not been a workable one, so the department will revert
to the approach which will include all sector departments in the province,
in order to have a hands-on approach to disaster management.

The province has made available a grant to purchase firefighting equipment
called Advanced Firefighting Technology, which is a skid pack operated by
volunteers trained in the five districts. This was to enable quick response
to domestic fires in municipalities.

The province makes an annual grant available to districts to facilitate the
observations of NEA. Currently more than 1 300 users are connected on the
NEA system. This assists especially in monitoring disasters and any other
emergencies in remote, rural and farming areas.

The Pixley ka Seme district has a fully functional District Disaster
Management Centre with a disaster management plan and a disaster management
framework in place. It is connected to NEA and trained volunteers are
available with the AFT firefighting skids.

The challenges here are that the district municipality and the Category B
municipalities have no fully fledged firefighting services, no dedicated
personnel for disaster management, no dedicated budgets and all the
volunteers are leaving for other jobs because they do not get stipends.

The Siyanda District has not appointed a head for disaster management since
the resignation of the last manager a year ago. The district has a fully
functional District Disaster Management Centre. It has not completed the
district disaster management plan nor has it completed the management
framework. It is connected to NEA and trained volunteers with the AFT skid
packs are assisting there.

The challenges in this district are basically the same as those in the
other districts except that Khara Hais Municipality, which is based in
Upington, and the district municipality are the only ones who have fully
fledged disaster management and firefighting capacity with dedicated staff
and a dedicated budget.

The Kgalagadi district has a fully functional plan and centre without a
framework in place and it is also connected to the NEA system.

Namakwa has a fully functional Disaster Management Centre which has not
completed the management plan and district management framework. NEA is
also connected and the very same challenges that I’ve mentioned in terms of
the Category B municipalities apply here as well.

The Frances Baard District has a fully fledged district management plan as
well as a centre and a framework in place. It is also connected to NEA and
there are AFT firefighting skid packs available.

It is known that in the Frances Baard District we have the Sol Plaatje
Municipality which is the only Category B in this area that has a fully
fledged and dedicated staff to deal with disaster management.

There, the challenges are again the fact that all of the other
municipalities do not have these facilities to assist. We therefore request
greater co-operation among all the parties involved, so as to make disaster
management assistance easier. Hon Chairperson, I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): Just before I proceed, Chairperson, just to
make the point to hon Watson and hon Wilkinson, up until 15 September I am
available to speak to in terms of having a deliberations talk.
[Interjections.]

Chairperson, let me make the point that I come from a province that is
disaster-prone. In the Western Cape we have various seasons. In winter we
deal with floods. In summer we deal with fires. So, every winter and every
summer we know we have to deal with these two issues to an extent that we
are going beyond understanding it as a disaster. Something has to be done.

Let me also make the point that as part of our work we have done research
and identified that in the Western Cape alone we have 38 hazards that can
cause any disaster and may include floods, fires, avian flu and many
others. All together there are 38 and therefore that process has to
therefore develop planning and response to the type of hazards we have
identified which is part of what the Act requires of us to do as provinces.

The Fire Risk Assessment for the 2007-08 fire season in the Western Cape
indicated that the good rains have increased vegetation growth. The
environmental services study on climate change indicated that we could
expect longer and drier summer seasons in the Western Cape. The effect of
the two conditions stipulated above on veld fires will be larger and more
intense fire incidents that can lead to conflagration and disastrous fires
in the province.

The result of such fires in the water catchment areas will be erosion and
environmental degradation. Where the fires occur in the fynbos biosphere,
it may have the effect of endangered species being lost. Further, results
of the loss of these natural resources such as fynbos and flower-picking
activities will lead, as my colleague indicated, to loss of livelihoods for
close communities depending on fynbos and flower-picking activities and
contracts.

The climate change challenge that we are facing may have further effects on
informal settlements as it is known that hot warm weather goes with strong
winds which could lead to runaway fires in the informal settlements. The
impact of these fires will be on the poorest of the poor where they will be
losing all of their personal belongings and livelihood. The Western Cape
economy will also be affected by veld and forest fires, as well as informal
settlement fires.

In terms of our state of preparedness, the current state of fire brigade
services in the province, as indicated earlier by other colleagues, is
split between Category C and B municipalities – that is your district and
local municipalities. Working for Fire, supported by the Department of
Water Affairs and Forestry, has planned for nine ground firefighting teams
with four teams still in the planning stages awaiting contracts with
partners such as Newlands National Park, Knysna and Jonkershoek. The teams
will be placed in strategic points in the province according to the veld
and forest fire risks.

Whilst on the issue of state of preparedness, I do also want to mention in
this House that, as a province, we have up to this point, since last year,
mobilised over 800 volunteers, because if we are dealing with issues of
fire and disaster, somebody has to be infiltrated and you have to be able
to educate and engage with communities if you are at a people-centred
stage. That work done, also as a requirement in terms of our Act, we have
also as part of the state of preparedness worked with all the 30
municipalities. Each of the 30 municipalities in the Western Cape has been
instructed since the last financial year to adopt fire by-laws.

What we have discovered is that whilst disasters can be natural, sometimes
there is recklessness which includes two issues here: where people who stay
in informal settlements would deliberately, some of them, set another shack
on fire to enable relief and so on. I mean, we have to strike with the law
and act on those issues. We also are aware of people who throw stompies out
of their cars and destroy Table Mountain with veld fires and we are saying
that is not a natural disaster. It is human created and has to be dealt
with accordingly and therefore each municipality out of the 30 have those
fire by-laws that they are going to enforce and there are fines related to
that.

We also, as part of that, are convinced that we also have to deal with the
cause of risk, because if there are these risks somebody is causing them.
Sometimes we can speak and relate to insurance companies in terms of their
role; in terms of what role they can play in this.

In terms of our state of readiness in the province: most of the
municipalities’ vehicles and equipment are outdated and need replacement or
are insufficient to attend to the local risks and cannot support adjacent
municipalities without compromising their areas. In this regard, as a
province, we have quantified our needs. We have come to the conclusion that
what we need is R500 million to replace our equipment.

We have engaged with the Department of Provincial and Local Government,
DPLG, and the National Disaster Management Centre in this regard to seek
support, but linked to this is the whole issue of maintenance. It is of no
use to bring new things when you are not going to budget and maintain the
infrastructure that you have and we think that it is very important for us
to move forward, because what you are not able to maintain in one year,
will cost you close to three times as much later on.

Working on Fire aerial firefighting support by means of helicopters for
veld and forest fires and fixed-wing aircraft is in the planning process
and has not yet been confirmed. The Department of Local Government and
Housing has made, in our province, an amount of R1,7 million available to
support municipalities in aerial firefighting. We have based this on what
we were able to spend last year where we were supposed to spend R3 million
and you can see that R1,7 million is a shortfall of R1,3 if the same extent
of fire were to happen in the Western Cape, but we are also going forward
in creating around that.

I also want to share with the House, hon members, that we haven’t recorded
our needs with the DPLG. We are pleased that on 18 September the Fire
Brigade Board nationally is going to be meeting, chaired by Deputy Minister
Nomatyala Hangana, where we are reporting and discussing some of these
issues and I would urge it would be good if members of this House could
also be part of that when we relate some of these issues.

In terms of the issue of disaster risk reduction, we feel that it must be
integral in the planning processes, therefore the disaster management
chapters are noted by myself and the integrated development plans, IDPs,
that were approved. The IDPs that we are approving in this current period –
we are very clear that no IDPs are going to be approved if they do not have
a disaster management chapter are about planning for that. If you miss it
in the IDP, you therefore must take responsibility if you did not plan for
it. There is an old saying in our province that we always say ...

Daar is ’n groot gat in die dak. As dit nie reën nie sê niemand niks oor
water, maar as dit reën, dan weet julle daar is ‘n groot gat in die dak.
[There is a big hole in the roof. If it does not rain then nobody says
anything about water coming through the roof, but when it rains then they
know that there is a big hole in the roof.]

In essence what that says is that disaster management is an ongoing task.
It is a process that you have to plan, prepare and budget for. You can’t be
shaken when this happens and you are not prepared for it.

We also have the Provincial Disaster Management Centre in this province
which is, we believe, well equipped. I think the Eastern Cape and other
provinces have exposed themselves and I would like to invite our
neighbouring province, the Northern Cape, as part of the three province
interprovincial collaboration – Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern
Cape – to see that as an important project, because we are likely to share
resources very soon. [Laughter.]

We have also, as a province, taken it upon ourselves that there is a need
for us to engage – to engage with best practices. We have taken two trips
so far. We have been to Cuba and Germany, and in Cuba we were exposed to
the kind of way in which you involve communities as part of disaster
management and we are taking to heart some of those lessons in the present.
Recently we have been to Germany, to learn of the way in which they use
volunteers and the level of equipment that they have. What is new to us
here is very old in Germany, so that you can see that we are far in terms
of the level of preparedness around these kinds of issues.

We also need to thank the National Disaster Management Centre for the kind
of support they have given us up to now, because we are raising our needs
and the National Treasury or National Treasurer being engaged around how we
allocate some of this budget around some of these issues. There is an issue
here, in general, how to deal with this, especially in their department of
resources and capacity.

We want to see how we link up the role of districts, because out of 30
municipalities you are not going to equip each of those 30 municipalities.
How do you make the district responsible, etc, on this issue?

In conclusion, I think the other issue that we think is very important,
that we will also be discussing on 18 September, is an investment that we
make towards 2010. As a country and as provinces are we ready in terms of
delivery towards 2010, but also beyond 2010, so that beyond 2010 our
provinces in the country have the kind of resources and capacity to deal
with some of these issues.

We are embarking on an annual awareness programme in communities about some
of the issues. I thank you, Acting Chairperson. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon members, I have
been alerted by the Table staff that the next speaker, hon Yawa of North
West, is not available, so we will continue with speaker number 10 and that
is hon Kgoshi Mokoena.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Madam Chairperson, it is known who that person is who
likes today better than yesterday but hon Watson’s utterances cannot be
left uncorrected. He said the national government and provinces were
reluctant or that their involvement in disaster management was very
minimal. But he knows very well that our national government and our
provinces have acted swiftly to attend to those calamities. He also knows
very well that it was for the very first time in this country that when
disasters struck, national and provincial leaders, accompanied by local
leaders, swiftly went to the affected areas where they conducted the
inspection, not to read about them in newspapers or hear about them on the
radio. [Interjections.]

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, would you please, with due respect, call on the
speaker to correct his statement? I did not speak about national
government. If the hon member wants to quote me he must do so correctly;
otherwise he must rest in peace. [Laughter.]
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Madam Chairperson, I would empathise with
the hon Watson to have what he said corrected. Maybe we should check that
in Hansard. But to say to another member that he must go and die - because
he said rest in peace ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! Chief Whip,
those were not the words that hon Watson said. You may continue, hon Kgoshi
Mokoena.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. I respect hon Watson so much
that I shall not respond to what he said because people might not notice
the difference between me and him. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! Hon members
please stop your private conversations and listen to the member speaking.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, before I deal with issues on this topic,
let me, as was rightly conveyed by our Minister and other speakers, also
convey our heartfelt condolences to those who lost their loved ones and
those who were affected by these fires. Your loss is our loss! It is
painful also to note that there are some who died in the mission of saving
other people’s lives. I’m referring to our firefighters here. These heroes
and heroines will be remembered forever.

In the Limpopo province, for example, there had been 19 incidents of fire-
breaks which destroyed 28,5 hectares of blue-gum trees worth R20 000, 70
000 hectares of pine trees worth R1,7 million, six hectares of blue berries
of a very high breed, and 3 000 hectares of grassland of which the value is
unknown.

In Limpopo we are fortunate that there was no loss of life. Our farmers
were able to remove some of the livestock before the fires could break up.
We were fortunate also because no building was damaged. We did not see or
hear of any fatalities. It was only in our neighbouring town of Graskop
where we experienced a lot of damage and loss of lions.

I want us to look at some of the causes of those fires. After a thorough
investigation it was established that those fires were caused by cigarette
butts, controlled burns that ignited and even people who were just naughty.
Now, the question that is directed to all of us in this august House as
oversight practitioners is: What would be our intervention in this regard?
Are we going to sit and only react or be surprised when such disasters
strike? Or are we going to come up with preventative measures to deal with
challenges that affect our people as a result of these fires?

I must mention that there used to be the so-called rangers who used to
patrol our areas. What prevents our provinces from introducing such
measures again? It is imperative that there should be disaster management
centres at all strategic points in all our provinces to respond to calls
for services. Are these services going to be localised or still be
centralised? Do we have competent officials in charge of managing these
centres?

It is disturbing to realise that when disaster struck, it took not less
than five days to extinguish those fires. It is sad to note that we are
always reacting after the fact. Unfortunately the majority of our
municipalities are not capacitated to deliver such services. You can
imagine when some of these municipalities are unable to compile their own
IDPs – their line consultant. What more if they are to manage these
services? Municipalities were mandated to deal with health matters but they
messed them up. Hence the mandate was withdrawn.

As the NCOP, let us propose that the provinces establish disaster
management centres in all areas to help skilled personnel who can handle
any situation with speed. Let those centres be well equipped. It is a
matter of concern to witness firefighters battling to extinguish a fire but
still the building or property burns to ashes in their presence.

Secondly, as this House, let us propose that we have fire stations in all
our districts. I experienced an occasion where a particular community
waited for a firefighter for two hours. When he finally arrived, a property
with three kids inside was burnt to ashes.
Thirdly, let us propose to have weather services that are centralised. Let
us have units that will be able to have regular meetings with relevant
departments and stakeholders.

Fourthly, let provinces develop programmes to address communities about
climate change. There is talk of global warming. What roles are played by
the country or provinces to enrich these discussions?

What we need to ask as this House is: What are we going to do with people
who deliberately cause these fires? After enjoying their puffs they throw
cigarette butts anywhere, especially while they are driving.
The question that needs to be answered is: what has happened with those
fire station managers who are reluctant to attend or respond to calls? I
would suggest that if it is true that there are managers who behave like
that ...

... gagabobona e be thabeng. [... their home will be in the mountains.]

They should not be redeployed to civil society. I hope from now onwards
there will be proper co-ordination between relevant stakeholders when
handling this kind of choice.

Our thanks go to our national and provincial departments for their swift
reaction during the disasters that had occurred previously. I am referring
to none other than our people’s leaders – our Minister, the Deputy Minister
and MECs in the affected provinces. To you I can only say no matter how
deep the bottle, the cream will always be on top. Thank you, Madam
Chairperson. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Deputy Chairperson, I
would like to thank the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Provincial
and Local Government as well as other hon members for their participation
in this debate. A special word of thanks to the MECs and other special
delegates from provinces for sharing information with the House about what
is happening in their respective provinces, and their responses thereto.
From this discussion, it is clear that provinces and municipalities have an
uneven capacity to present and mitigate disasters. But indeed we need to
appreciate the efforts of the MECs and their colleagues in the provinces to
attend to this problem of inadequate capacity. We also appreciate these
efforts and we need to encourage them to do more.

I want to confirm partly for the ratification of one of the participants in
the debate that Mpumalanga and the Western Cape are two of the provinces
which have the best organised Working on Fire programmes. [Applause.] It’s
important that we encourage the other provinces to take a closer look at
what exists in these two provinces in order to see whether they can’t learn
from what is being done in these two provinces rather than we invite them
in.

Disaster prevention and mitigation, as it has been said in this debate, are
not the sole responsibility of the government. I am informed that currently
there are 91 registered Fire Protection Associations in the country. We
clearly need more of these because these Fire Protection Associations are
but one of the forums that bring government and the other stakeholders
together to co-ordinate efforts and resources towards preventing disasters
and mitigating disasters.

So, it is important that as we do our oversight work, especially as the
NCOP, we also need to pay attention to this question: To what extent can we
also lend a hand in the effort to mobilise stakeholders other than
government to participate in the activities or form these Fire Protection
Associations?

I think we also need to encourage members of the public to take the lead in
the National Fire Danger Rating Systems which appear on television and the
radio and in the print media in order to understand when to take extra
precautions against fire. So, sometimes we would decry the lack of
resources or the inadequacy of resources when in fact we do not make full
use of existing resources in order to insulate ourselves from these
problems that we are talking about. So, I am saying let all of us
contribute whatever we can in order to improve our nation’s readiness to
prevent and mitigate disasters. Otherwise, once more, thank you all for
your participation in this debate. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): We want to thank
you, hon Minister and the Deputy Minister, for the informative, detailed
and explanatory contribution in the debate, and your presence here today. I
am sure hon members appreciate your contribution.

Debate concluded.

 CONSIDERATION OF PROGRAMME 2009 - REPORT ON REVIEW OF PRIORITIES FOR 2007-
                       08 AND 2008-09 FINANCIAL YEARS

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Deputy Chairperson, hon members, hon special
delegates and MECs present today, thank you very much for giving me this
opportunity to give a statement on Programme 2009.

Programme 2009 serves as our guide in the performance of the work of the
National Council of Provinces – NCOP - during this term. The document lists
four main targets that we must achieve by the end of this term. It states
that by 2009 the NCOP must have done the following things - I am quoting
these purposely so that all chairpersons of committees, as they deliberate
in their committees and do their oversight, plan. Make sure that these get
into your plans and that you achieve these issues.

Firstly, we need to increase oversight work, guided by the input from the
provinces and local government regarding their needs and interests.
Secondly, there must be promoted public participation with a clear impact
on service delivery and the work of Parliament. Thirdly, there must be
ensured improved support to local government through closely monitoring
government programmes at municipal level. Fourthly, there must be ensured
improved intergovernmental relations as a result of the NCOP’s sustained
contribution to building the system of co-operative government.

You know those from the past three years. We have been talking about them
in our workshops and debating them also in this House. We also debated them
in our summit that we had in May.

Now, the document in front of us contains a breakdown of the work that we
need to do to achieve these targets. As we agreed at the beginning of last
year, each year we would revise the priorities so that we are able to focus
on key areas of our work, given changing circumstances.

A few months ago I presented a set of priorities to the Whippery and
chairpersonship of the committees. My proposal was that we have a long-term
view this time and look at the priorities from now until the end of 2009.
My belief is that it is not likely that we can have major policy shifts
during the remaining part of the current term. Also, having a long-term
view would help with planning and ensuring that we have the resources
needed to carry out this function for the work that we are supposed to do
as committee chairpersons and presiding officers.

We agreed at that meeting that while such an approach is correct, to set
our priorities until the end of the term, we must be flexible and be
prepared to revisit the document if circumstances do change. We will
certainly do so as the importance of this document is its relevance to
prevailing circumstances.

I want to deal with the key service delivery focuses that we are dealing
with in Programme 2009. The first one is a social transformation in terms
of education, health, housing, social security, sport and recreation, and
land and agriculture. The second one is empowerment of women and youth;
creation of economic opportunities; Asgisa and Jipsa; public transport and
infrastructure; Expanded Public Works Programmes; and job creation. The
third one is safety and security - to boost community involvement, and
create domestic violence and crime-fighting strategies. The fourth one is
governance and local service and that is local government capacity,
assistance to local government, and intergovernmental fiscal
administration.

You will recall that last year we said we must be biased towards supporting
delivery at local government level and I hope that all of us and all the
committees are planning to do that, because that is where the major
delivery of services takes place. It is at local government level. If we
don’t get in there and go and support those local government structures,
then we would find that we are lacking somehow in performing our oversight
function.

The follow-up on issues from 2004 comprises a selection of issues from the
state of the nation address. Issues from 2004-07 are categorised according
to key focus areas, looking at a framework and quality and impact of
service delivery.

The other thing we have to look into is the issue of the legislation. This
means the identification of some key section 76 legislation, from 1997 to
date, to dedicate follow-ups and to list these pieces of legislation as it
is contained in the revised document that we have tabled this afternoon.
The list includes, for example, the Water Services Act, Adult Basic
Education and Training Act, National Health Act and Older Persons Act. We
have just identified those four pieces of legislation. What we are
requesting those committees to do is that they should take those pieces of
legislation, and scrutinise them, whether they are implemented or not.

We believe they are key and important pieces of legislation. What’s
happening with the Older Persons Act? Is it being implemented in draft or
are there perhaps problems with this Act? What is happening with the
National Health Act? Is it being implemented in the draft or are there
problems and gaps on the ground to implement this Act? What is happening
with the Water Services Act? Is it being implemented on the ground or are
there problems? Let’s take the Adult Basic Education and Training Act.

We have just mentioned those four pieces of legislation to say, look at
them and come back and report in the NCOP. Debate and give us a sort of
introspection into these particular pieces of legislation – whether they
impact on the lives of our people or how they impact on the lives of our
people on the ground.
Internal and external relations is one issue that is contained in the
document. Internal relations: this section deals with the promotion of
principles of intergovernmental relations and co-operative government and
the monitoring of decisions of intergovernmental relations forums and
government plans. Yesterday, Tuesday, we had a workshop on
intergovernmental relations where we have been examining the expenditure of
provinces in seven years and stating how the provinces are spending the
money that you allocate to them in terms of the division of revenue.

These are the issues that we have to take very seriously and monitor very
seriously on the ground. As the Minister of Finance said yesterday, you
would like to know where every cent has gone to and what it has been spent
on, as you have allocated it to the provinces.

In terms of intergovernmental relations, that becomes very important – how
you also relate to the other spheres of government and legislatures in
dealing with those issues.

Now, external relations: this section deals with the need to prioritise
Africa and developments within the continent when it comes to international
participation. It is a very crucial issue. I have said myself there is a
lot that we can learn in Africa, not only in Europe and America. You still
get this trend that our committees really like to go to America. They would
rather go there to learn than to Nigeria or Ghana or the Congo. You can
learn a lot of things on the continent.

In respect of the international agreements that we ratify in this House and
even in the other House - we have entered into agreements with many of the
continent’s countries. What are we doing about this in terms of monitoring
it and sharing our experiences with other countries on the continent? But
no, if I look at your international travel and study tours, you still want
to learn from Europe, you still want to learn from America. At what stage
are we going to learn from Africa and really deal with critical issues that
are affecting us as a continent in Africa? Those are becoming the key and
important issues.

I can raise just one similar issue that I deal with myself, economic
empowerment. What is happening with trade within Parliament? Those are the
things we should be looking at, because we should be saying, let us trade
with each other on the continent and when we do that we will then be
increasing our economy, stabilising our economy, improving our economy,
growing our economy - because we traded with each other.

I normally ask this very important question: Where does all the oil that
Nigeria has go to? It goes to America. It goes to Europe. Why can’t it come
to South Africa? Why can’t it go to Zambia? Why can’t it go to Namibia? Why
can’t it go to the other countries on the continent? The overproduction can
go to other countries.

I normally ask the question: What happens to the platinum that is mined in
such large quantities in South Africa? Where does it go to? It goes
somewhere else. It comes back to South Africa after it has been polished
and we buy it at great expense and we think we are doing very well. I asked
some people in Ghana: “Do you enjoy nice chocolates?” They said to me:
“Mahlangu, yes we do.” I said: “What happens to your cocoa?” They said it
goes to Europe. Then what happens? London produces very nice chocolates and
they send it back to Ghana, where it is bought at great expense and
enjoyed.

What is happening to our gold? All those things: the rings that you are
wearing there. Where is gold being polished and being made into jewellery
right now? Are we doing enough on the continent to supply and process these
things ourselves? That is the type of issue I am trying to raise with the
people. Let’s focus also on internal relations, on the issues of the
continent and not only America, Europe and Russia, etc.

Coming to the systems and mechanisms that are covered in this document,
these are the ways and means to improve effective implementation of the
above-mentioned first three priority areas that I’ve spoken about. Now what
we need in putting those mechanisms in place is proper planning and co-
ordination. We must implement these systems and mechanisms to focus and
manage the NCOP work through the Whippery and committees.

It’s very important to engage the provinces on all these issues so that we
work together. The reporting system becomes very important. Regular
reporting on the impact of Programmes and activities should be linked with
programme 2009 and include political oversight. In this respect we will
have improved the format of committee reports so that they relate to the
objectives of Programme 2009.

Hon Shiceka, when you give a report in this House for a debate, it’s not
necessary to tell this House you met on 21 March and you deliberated on
this legislation, full stop. I’m not interested in that. What we are
interested in is the content of the report. If you have been dealing with a
piece of legislation that focuses on local government, what is the content
of that legislation? That’s what we are looking for.

I know you met on 21 March, but what were the critical issues raised in the
public hearings? How did you, in terms of that particular legislation,
produce a quality piece of legislation? If you do your provincial oversight
work visit, I’m not interested to hear that you’ve been in the Eastern Cape
on this or that day, you met with the mayor, you met with the councillors,
full stop.

I know you’ve been there, but what I want to know is what you’ve discovered
whilst you were there, what the programme is that you’re putting in place
to deal with the problems that you have encountered and what it is that you
have shared with your colleagues in the province or municipality to deal
with those issues. That’s the content of the type of report that we would
like to have. And it must talk to Programme 2009, it must not be a
programme that is hanging in the air and is not talking to anything.

Now those are the important things. One last thing under the reports that I
want to capture very clearly is this: It does not help us to come to the
end of the year here in this House, then put up a pile of reports and run
them through quickly like a tape recorder, and then we adjourn and leave.
What is important is that committees must produce quarterly reports. We
have requested this. We debate them because we shall have time to debate
them, even if we spend a whole day debating quarterly reports.

Then, towards the end of the year, we compile our annual report, which we
can table in the ATCs, and we don’t have to go back to the reports which
we’ve produced. As we produce these reports it helps us to say what the
things are that we have not done in the previous quarter, what the things
are that we have to carry over to the next quarter, so that when we report
on the next quarter we can measure our performance and ourselves, or set a
benchmark in terms of the work of the committee. The demands placed on us
as a result of oversight work that we must do to advance the struggle
against poverty and underdevelopment require us to work smarter. Hence the
need to identify the above areas we think are critical.

The reality is that in order to carry out this mandate in a meaningful way
the NCOP needs to be focused. If we are not focused we will not be able to
achieve our objectives, as we said. We cannot do everything. We cannot. We
are a small House. We wish we could do everything, but we can’t. Hence we
have tried to guide committees to identify key areas that we should work
on. It is therefore the intention of this document to ensure that we focus
our work. I’m confident that we can focus on doing the things we have
identified above. We can go a long way in terms of making an impact on the
lives of our people.

If the House agrees with these revised priorities as contained on page 10
of yesterday’s ATCs, we will make available a pocket-sized book for easy
reference so that members, wherever they are, can take it along and consult
it with regard to whatever they want to do. It will be a small book like
the Constitution. You can put it in your pocket or briefcase. Every member
will have one so that you are in a position to check every time when you
meet in the committee and look at your plan as to whether the issues which
we’ve raised in this document are captured in your work from day to day.

So we will print that book for you. We want you to always carry this
document to remind yourself during your engagement with your meetings or
site visits of our aggrieved areas of focus towards achieving the targets I
spoke about earlier in the same way that you always carry your
Constitution. I commend the proposed revised priority for the current and
next financial year to this House. I thank you very much.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): I shall now put the
question. The question is that the report be adopted. As the decision is
dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution I shall first
ascertain whether all delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast
their provinces’ votes. Are all the delegation heads present?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): In accordance with
Rule 71 I shall first allow provinces the opportunity to make their

alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must please indicate to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against or abstain from voting.
