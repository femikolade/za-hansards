   STEPS TOWARDS EFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN
                                   SCHOOLS

                             (Draft Resolution)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I have two motions. I will
start with the first one.


Taking into consideration that today is the day of taking a girl-child to
the workplace, I have three girls in the office of the Chief Whip in the
NCOP by the names of Miss Yusra, from Islamia College, Ms Hanifa from
Rosendale Senior Secondary School, and Miss Annelies Pentwa from Mxaiya
Senior Secondary School, who were acting and are still acting as Chief Whip
in my office. They have instructed me to move a motion without notice as
follows:

  That the Council -


   (1)      notes that -


         (a)      a safe and disciplined learning environment is one of the
             critical elements for the successful delivery of quality
             education; and


         (b)      the alarming rate of substance abuse and violence in
             schools and the prevailing legacy of apartheid poverty in our
             communities are some of the key factors that continue to
             undermine the learning environment in many schools across the
             country, particularly in the Western Cape; and


   (2)      calls upon -
         (a)      all schools and their governing bodies to develop drug
             usage, misuse and dependency management plans that reflect the
             ethos and values of the country’s National Policy on Drug
             Abuse Management in Schools, which is intended to contribute
             towards effective prevention and management of substance abuse
             by learners in schools; and


         (b)      the Department of Social Development to expand its poverty
             intervention mechanisms through schools to ensure that
             learners from poor families, especially those who qualify for
             grants, are assisted.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       CALL FOR DELAY OF RELOCATION OF MOTHLOTHLO COMMUNITY IN LIMPOPO

                             (Draft Resolution)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council –

   (1)      notes with concern challenges raised by the Mothlothlo
       community, under Kgoshigadi Langa of the Mapilo Traditional
       Authority in Limpopo, with the Limpopo permanent delegates under the
       leadership of Hon H Matlanyane during the provincial week from 14 to
       18 May this year, namely –


       (a) that the Anglo Plats Mine wants to continue relocating people
             from the area before they implement agreements that were
             reached between them and the community; and


       (b) that this has angered the community to an extent where they
             threaten to use force to physically stop the whole process if
             their concerns are ignored;


   (2)      therefore calls upon the Department of Minerals and Energy,
       together with the Ministry, to expeditiously intervene to avoid the
       looming fiasco or catastrophe, and to delay the forceful removal of
       those poor communities at Mothlothlo until all agreed processes are
       implemented; and


   (3)      requests that the Department of Minerals and Energy reports back
       to the Council at their earliest convenience.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          CELEBRATION OF AFRICA DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Hon House Chair, I move without notice:

   That the Council notes that –


   (1)      tomorrow, 25 May 2007, marks the celebration of Africa Day, a
       day which has been celebrated by the 850 million people of Africa
       since the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in
       1963;


   (2)      this day remains a historic reminder to all of us about Africa’s
       collective struggle against colonialism and the resilient
       determination of African leaders to fight against the systemic
       obliteration of our continent by colonialists; and


   (3)      the theme for this year, which is “Reflections on Post-colonial
       Africa - Towards making the 21st Century an African one”, challenges
       all the people of Africa to -


       (a) never forget the collective efforts of the heroes and heroines
             of Africa who fought bitterly for the liberation of our
             continent; and


       (b) work together for a collective and integrated developmental
             agenda for the advancement of the African continent in the
             21st Century.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Budget Vote No 34 – Water Affairs and Forestry:

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Hon members, before we proceed, I
want to welcome, on behalf of this House, the acting NCOP Chief Whips who
are sitting in the gallery. I also want to welcome the Minister of Defence,
hon Lekota, and also the hon Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry, hon
Hendrickse, and the officials from the department. Thank you for coming to
participate and listen to the debate in this House.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: House Chair, hon members of
this House, ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today in my first
policy review debate in the NCOP since my appointment as Minister of Water
Affairs and Forestry. I think the last time I stood here was the day when I
had been shifted; I was in between posts. [Laughter.] I had been presenting
a Bill from my previous portfolio, and that afternoon I was moved to this
portfolio. But it is nice to be here again.

Hon Minister of Defence, thank you for the support and for being with us in
the House. Over the past 12 months that I have been Minister of Water
Affairs and Forestry, my department has accomplished a great deal in
creating a better life for our people. I will just touch on some of the
highlights over the past year, and the plans that we have for this year.

Just last year 1,2 million people received access to basic water,
contributing to our target of eradicating the backlog of people without
access to water by 2008. An additional 250 000 households received access
to basic sanitation. We plan to intensify efforts this year to achieve an
even greater impact in these areas.

Also last year, 74 000 units of the bucket system were eradicated, with the
remaining units in the formal established settlements set to be eradicated
this year. I reported to the National Assembly during my budget debate that
we are left with 106 000 units of the bucket system in these settlements,
and that I have held sanitation summits in those provinces that are most
affected by this bucket system of sanitation, which are the Orange Free
State ... rather Free State. I am sorry about that - the Orange River still
runs there. The other provinces are the Eastern Cape and North West. I
would really like to thank the Premiers from all the three provinces who
not only attended these summits but showed their commitment to eradicating
the budget system, together with their MECs and mayors who attended these
three summits and also showed commitment to eradicating the bucket system.

Where we stand, we look forward to this bucket system being eradicated by
our target date of December 2007. Indeed, I am aware that hon members are
going to raise an issue around the definition of the bucket system, as was
adopted by Cabinet. We will deal with that when we respond.

Also, 76% of households benefited from provision of free basic water last
year. Some areas have experienced problems with this service and we have
seen a proactive response by Mpumalanga, which has programmes that involve
communities to address operational and maintenance problems.

During the past year we have also embarked on an extensive process of water
use verification. In a number of catchments in each province, as you know,
illegal water use is a threat to our allocation of water. Our Free State
office has developed a fully functional enforcement and compliance unit to
deal with people who steal our water.

In Limpopo, we have started work on the De Hoop Dam, and you saw the soil-
turning event which launched our Water Week. That dam will be constructed.
The dam itself will bring much-needed water to approximately 800 000 people
who presently are without access to water in that area. It will obviously
also unlock the mining potential of the platinum group of metals, which we
are told still has to be mined for 100 years in that area. So there is a
very exciting project starting there.

Limpopo will also see the completion of the water treatment works for the
Nandoni Dam, which, at a cost R389 million, will see over 700 000 people
being given access to water, with many more people benefiting in the future
from our plans to extend this project. This project is also due for
completion this year.

Still on Limpopo, we are supporting the planned power station in Lephalale,
and this financial year we will be completing the feasibility study for the
pipeline to take water to the power station.

When it comes to Mpumalanga, our plans to support electricity generation
and the liquid fuels industry will see the completion of the Vaal
augmentation pipeline during this financial year. The Injaka water
purification and distribution works, as well as the pipeline that will take
water for domestic use to the rural villages of Acornhoek in Mpumalanga,
will also be completed during this financial year.

Work on the Berg River Dam, here in the Western Cape, has been ongoing.
This project, which will increase available water in the Western Cape, will
also be completed this year.

In KwaZulu-Natal, the Hluhluwe regional water works will almost be
completed by the end of this financial year. This project will be providing
rural communities in northern KwaZulu-Natal with water for domestic use.

In the Northern Cape we are constructing a R22 million water pipeline from
the Orange River to Colesberg.

These are just some of the projects, hon members, that we are going to
undertake this year, whereby we really intend to change the people’s lives
through access to water and sanitation.

Draft regulations for the support to resource-poor farmers have been
published and we should start to see an increase of our support to these
farmers during this financial year. Already, we have supplied rainwater
harvesting tanks to the farmers and we have plans to extend this programme
with further 200 rainwater tanks this year in Limpopo, the Free State and
the Eastern Cape, as well as 1 000 of the smaller “Jojo” water tanks being
provided in Thaba Nchu in the Free State.

The North West will be installing early-warning systems in the groundwater
aquifers in the Vryburg area, so that we are able to detect levels of
groundwater and so make better use of this water resource.

During the past financial year we also raised our profile in the
international community. Most of you will be aware that we hosted an
international conference on earth observation technology for use in
obtaining water-related information. Some of our officials have
participated and presented papers at different international conferences.
South Africa is increasingly being seen as a leading light in addressing
the pressing water and sanitation challenges facing the poor, and
particularly people living in the rural areas. This view was supported
during the launch of the 2006 United Nations Development Programme Report,
which was launched here in Cape Town.

During this financial year we will be hosting two international events. The
first is the Unesco symposium on hydrological issues which will be held in
November 2007; and the second, which I am pleased to announce today, is our
sanitation conference for African countries. This conference will be held
in KwaZulu-Natal in February next year, and will see the attendance of
African Ministers to discuss critical issues on sanitation.

Cabinet has also approved that South Africa can participate in a huge
exhibition and conference that will be held in Zaragoza, Spain, during
2008.

Hon members, African co-operation has also remained very high on our agenda
during the past year. In addition to our participation in the African
Ministers’ Council on Water, or Amcow, we have been active in watercourse
commissions that were established to manage the rivers we share with our
neighbouring countries, that is Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Mozambique,
Botswana and Zimbabwe.

While there are all these achievements and successes, there were also a
number of challenges that we faced in the water and forestry sector over
the past year. Some of these include the ongoing delays in the issuing of
water licences for afforestation and the pollution in our dams. This
results in hon members of this House picking up the phone as they go past
the dams where they live and saying, “Hon Minister, it’s not only green,
it’s stinking; can’t you do something about it?” So these are the
challenges we face: pollution of our dams and rivers, the need to ramp up
delivery of access to water and sanitation, the capacity of certain
municipalities to deliver services, overburdened waste water treatment
infrastructure arising from the increased number of users, and, of course,
the drought that hit our country this past summer.

As you know from the public hearings and meetings that you have had with
the department, in my department we have had our own challenges internally,
particularly regarding the restructuring of the department, which has now
been ongoing for approximately nine years, and which we are trying to get
to finality. And there is also our qualified audit, as a department. I have
committed to dealing with both issues, in particular ensuring that the
department has a clean audit by the end of my term of office.

Amahhovisi ethu asezifundeni zonke futhi ayingxenye ebaluleke kakhulu
eMnyangweni Wezamanzi Nezamahlathi. La mahhovisi abalulekile eMnyangweni
ngoba abhekana nezinkinga zamanzi namahlathi, ezibhekana nomphakathi nsuku
zonke kohulumeni bezifundazwe. Ukwenza nje isibonelo, amahhovisi ethu
axhasa omasipala kwezamanzi nokuhanjiswa kwendle, abuye asize futhi lapho
kuvela izinkinga khona.

Ihhovisi lethu eliseNtshonalanga Kapa lisanda kwethula uhlelo oluhle
olumayelana nokuqeqeshwa nokulekelela omasipala ekusebenziseni
nasekunakekeleni izingqalasizinda. Lesi sinyathelo sihlanganisa nokubhalwa
kwezincwadi ezizoluleka omasipala ukuthi zinakekelwa kanjani lezi
zingqgalasizinda. Amahhovisi ethu ezifunda aphinde abheke izikhungo anazo
ezifundazweni, njengezinhlangano zabasebenzisi bamanzi, ibhodi yezamanzi
kanye nezikhungo zokuphathwa kwezindawo okuqhamuka kuzo amanzi.

Okunye okubalulekile ukuthi amahhovisi ethu asezifundeni anesibopho
sokuqinisa ubudlelwano nababambe iqhaza abahlukene esifundazweni. Amanye
amahhovisi azimbandakanya ezinhlakeni zohulumeni bezifunda ezibhekene
nokulethwa kwamanzi kanye nokuhanjiswa kwendle. La mahhovisi ayisigaba
sokuqala esithintwayo uma kufakwa izicelo zokugunyazwa kokusetshenziswa
kwamanzi noma amahlathi, kanti futhi basebenzisana nomasipala kanye
nezikhungo zamabhodi amanzi ukuqaphela ukuhlanzeka kwamanzi aphuzwayo.

Uma sibheka isabiwomali soMnyango sika 2007-08 amahhovisi ethu ezifundazwe
azokwabelwa imali engamarandi angamabhiliyoni angu-3,1 ecazwe esambeni
samarandi angamabhiliyoni angu-5,3 kusabiwomali salo nyaka. Lesi sabiwomali
engisethulayo phambi kwenu namhlanje sizosekela imizamo yethu yokukhulisa
umkhakha wezamahlathi, ukubhekela izidingo zabantu zezamanzi kanye
nokuhanjiswa kwendle. Lesi sabiwomali sizobuye sisize ekwakhiweni
kwezingqalasizinda, ukunakekela umkhakha wezamanzi kanye nokuqeqeshwa
kwabasebenzi boMnyango nabomasipala, ukuze izinsizakalo zamanzi zethulwe
ngempumelelo.

Ngizothanda ukwethula ezinye izinto ezimqoka ezibhekene noMnyango Wezamanzi
Namahlathi kulo nyaka wezimali ka 2007-08. Malungu ahloniphekileyo, okunye
okubalulekile ezigabeni zokusebenza kwethu ngesikhathi sonyaka wezimali
esikuwo ukuqinisekisa ukuthi siyafinyelela esibalweni esinqunyelwe sona
sokuqeda ukusetshenziswa kwamabhakede ezindaweni ezihlelekile kanye nokuba
nempumelelo ebonakalayo ekuqedeni ukusalela muva ekuletheni amanzi ngonyaka
ka-2008.

Inselelo enkulu esibhekene nayo eminyakeni emine elandelayo ukuqeda lokhu
kusalela muva maqondana nezindlu zangasese ngonyaka ka-2010. Sesikutholile
ukuthi isifundazwe ngasinye sisalele kangakanani emuva, futhi lokho
singakuthatha sikwehlise sikuyise nakumasipala, njengokuthi nje, isibonelo,
isifundazwe saseLimpopo sinamakhaya alinganiselwa ku-800 000 lapho kungekho
khona ukuthuthwa kwendle; kanti KwaZulu-Natali sinamakhaya alinganiselwa ku-
700 000 angenakho ukuthuthwa kwendle ngendlela efaneleyo; eMpumalanga kanye
nakomasipala abanjengoMaquasi Hills, eNyakatho Ntshonalanga, nakumasipala
waseLundini esifundeni saseMpumalanga Koloni, sebefikile esibalweni esingu-
100% ekuqedeni ukusetshenziswa kwamabhakede ezindaweni ezihlelekile.
Ngicabanga ukuthi kuhle sibaphe ihlombe kuleyo ndawo. [Ihlombe.]

Ukukhula okukhulu kwesabiwomali sethu okungu-19,9% wesamba semali salo
nyaka kusozisa ekuqedeni inkinga yokuthuthwa kwendle ngamabhakede. Uma
ubheka izinga lokusalela emuva, kuyasicacela ukuthi zizodingakala ezinye
izinsizakusebenza, ngaphezu kwalesi sabelo.

Omasipala yibo abadlala indima enkulu ukubhekana nalokhu kusalela emuva.
Siyaqhubeka nohlelo lwethu lokuthumela onjiniyela ukuthi bayosiza labo
masipala abaqhugayo. Ngingasho nje ukuthi emuva komhlangano wethu wase-Free
State lapho sabona khona ukuthi kuzoba nenkinga enkulu ngoba iFree State
iyona enamabhakede amaningi – alinganiselwa ku-80 000 enanini elingu 106
000 atholakala eFree State – siye sathumela-ke onjiniyela abalinganiselwa
kwaba-13 ukuyosiza eFree State.

Siyaqhubeka sisebenza nayo i-DBSA kuSiyenza Manje no-Project Consolidate
woMnyango Wezohulumeni Bezifundazwe Nabasekhaya, nezifundazwe. Futhi
siyaqhubeka nokuthi sibheke namanye amakhono kubantu abaphuma kwamanye
amazwe ukusiza kule ndima yochwepheshe emkhakheni wezamanzi.

Ingxenye yethu yokwesekela uhulumeni wasekhaya ifaka phakathi ukuqhuba
uhlelo lokufundisa imikhandlu ngokubahlomisa ukuthi baqonde kangcono
ngomkhakha wezamanzi nezamahlathi. Kulo nyaka nisibone siya
engqungqutheleni kaSalga lapho besenza khona lokhu esikubiza ngokuthi
“izifundo zokucathulisa”.

Sisebenzile futhi nezikhungo zokuthuthukiswa nokuhlelwa kwezamanzi lapho
sisebenza khona nomasipala abayizikhungo zokulawula ukusebenza kwamanzi
ukuze bahlele kahle ngenkathi behlelela amanzi, bazi ukuthi iyiphi
ingqalasizinda ekhona kule ndawo abakuyo ukuze bazi ukuthi angakanani
amanzi angatholakala, khona bezohlelela kahle amanzi abo azosetshenziswa
ezindlini nawokuthuthukisa umnotho.

Ukuqinisekisa ukuthi wonke umuntu uthola amanzi, uMnyango wami unezibopho
ezimbili zokuthi, ohlangothini lokuqala, uqhakambise ukongiwa kwamanzi
kanye nokunaka ukudingeka kwamanzi, kanti kolunye uhlangothi ukwakha
nokuthuthukisa izingqalasizinda ukuze kuhlangatshezwane nokukhulu
ukudingeka kwamanzi. Noma kuyinselelo enkulu ukuqhakambisa zombili lezi
zindlela, ukuze sikwazi ukusebenzisa ngokugcwele imithombo yethu yamanzi
ekhona ngaphambi kokuthi siqale sibheke imisebenzi emisha ekhona yokwakha
izingqalasizinda zemithombo yamanzi, siyasiqonda isidingo sokuba songe
amanzi.

Bese ngikhulumile nge-De Hoop Dam, okungomunye wemisebenzi esiyiqalile,
kanti kukhona neminye imisebenzi yezingqalasizinda ezolungiswa kulo nyaka,
isetshenzwe futhi inakekelwe esifundazweni ngasinye. Ngingasho nje ngithi
eGauteng sizolungisa i-Vlakfontein Canal njengengxenye yoSuthu-Vaal Scheme,
futhi sizobe silungisa siphinde sikhulise ukusebenza kokuhlanzwa kwamanzi
asemgudwini we-Vaal River, okungenye yezinto okufanele zenzeke.

Iningi lezingqalasizinda zemithombo yamanzi eyakhiwayo nguMnyango wethu
isezindaweni zasemakhaya kakhulu, emaphandleni eLimpopo, KwaZulu-Natali,
Mpumalanga naseNtshonalanga Koloni. Kweminingi yale misebenzi siqinisekisa
ukuthi sisebenzisa abantu abangomama nentsha. USihlalo ohloniphekile
wekomiti ngiyethemba ukuthi uyifakile le nto okulalelwa kuyo yokuhumusha
ngoba le yingxenye ayithintile futhi ake wangazisa ngayo. Manje uzojabula
ukuzwa ukuthi, kulo nyaka, esifundazweni saseNyakatho Ntshonalanga sizobe
sinomsebenzi wokuhlanza amanzi edamini laseHaartebeesport sisebenzisana
nenkampani ye-Rand Water. Ngingasho okuningi ngalokhu, maqondana nendlela
umonakalo osuwenzeke ngayo kuleli damu, ukunukubeza kwamanzi, ukufa
kwezinhlanzi njalo njalo. Kulo nyaka sizobe sisebenzisana ne-Rand Water
ukulungisa lokho. [Ihlombe.]

Ekunakekeleni ukongiwa kwamanzi kanye nokudingeka kwawo, sisekela  inhlolovo
ebe yimpumelelo komasipala abafana neMangaung, Cape Town kanye  naseMfuleni.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[We have offices in  all  provinces  and  they  are  an  important  part  of
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. These  offices  are  an  important
part of the department as they deal with the day-to-day water  and  forestry
issues facing the community  in  provincial  government.  For  example,  our
offices support municipalities in  their  day-to-day  water  and  sanitation
service delivery and intervene in cases where there is a crisis.

Our Western Cape  regional  office  recently  launched  a  very  interesting
programme aimed at training and supporting municipalities on operations  and
maintenance of infrastructure. This initiative involves the  development  of
training  manuals  that  guide  municipalities  on  how  to   manage   their
infrastructure. Our regional offices  also  provide  support  and  oversight
over  the  institutions  we  have  in  provinces,   such   as   Water   User
Associations, water boards and Catchment Management Agencies.

Another important thing is that these regional offices are  responsible  for
maintaining good relationships with various stakeholders in  the  provinces.
Other offices are involved in provincial government structures dealing  with
water and sanitation delivery. These offices are  the  first  port  of  call
when applying for water use or forestry licence, and  in  co-operation  with
municipalities and water boards they are also  involved  in  monitoring  the
quality of drinking water.

If we look at the Department of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry’s  budget  for
2007-08, out of a total  budget  of  R5,3  billion,  R3,1  billion  will  be
allocated to our regional offices during the  2007-08  financial  year.  The
budget I table before you  today  will  support  our  efforts  to  grow  the
forestry sector, and also address the basic water and  sanitation  needs  of
our people. This  Budget  will  contribute  to  infrastructure  development,
regulate and monitor water sector,  and  build  capacity,  both  within  the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry and in municipalities in  order  to
effectively deliver water services.

I would also like to outline some key challenges facing  the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry over the 2007-08  financial  year.  Hon  members,
one of the most important areas of our work during this  financial  year  is
to ensure that we eradicate the bucket  system  in  the  formal  established
settlements, and make substantial progress in  eradicating  the  backlog  of
access to water by 2008.

Our biggest challenge over the next four years is to address the  sanitation
backlog by 2010. We have identified the backlog in each province and we  can
easily translate this into municipalities.  Typical examples here  would  be
Limpopo where  we  still  have  approximately  800  000  households  without
adequate sanitation, and KwaZulu-Natal where there  is  also  a  significant
backlog  with  over  700  000  households  not  having  access  to  adequate
sanitation.   Whereas  in  provinces  such  as  Mpumalanga,  as   well   as,
municipalities like Maquasi Hills in North West  and  Elundini  Municipality
in the Eastern Cape have already eradicated  100%  of  the  bucket  backlog.
They are to be congratulated. [Applause.]

A significant increase of 19,9% in our budget for this financial year,  will
help in addressing some of the backlogs in eradicating  the  bucket  system.
Looking at the backlog that we have, it is clear that  additional  resources
will be required on top of this budget.

Municipalities are playing a critical role in addressing  the  backlogs.  We
are continuing with our programme of deploying engineers  to  municipalities
that require additional capacity. I can say that after our  meeting  in  the
Free State, where we recognised that there is going to be a problem  because
out of 106 000 households still using the bucket  system,  approximately  80
000 come from the Free State. We have since deployed 13  engineers  to  help
in the Free State.

Our relationship with the Development Bank of  Southern  Africa  in  Siyenza
Manje and Project Consolidate of the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government is continuing. We are also continually  looking  at  bringing  in
international expertise to help in the water sector.

Part of our support to the local government includes  running  a  councillor
induction programme to empower them with an understanding of the  water  and
forestry sectors. This year we attended Salga  convention  where  they  were
conducting “induction workshops”.

We have  also  worked  with  water  services  development  institutions  and
municipalities which are the institutions responsible for the  provision  of
water services so that they can do proper planning when they deal  with  the
provision of water services, and know which infrastructure they have in  the
area where they live and know how much water they can provide for  household
use and the development of economy.

In  ensuring  that  there  is  water  for  all,  my   department   has   two
responsibilities, which are; promoting water conservation and  water  demand
management and on the other hand  the  department  is  responsible  for  the
construction and upgrading of infrastructure to meet  the  increasing  water
demand. While it is a huge challenge to meet these two  responsibilities  in
order  to  conserve  water,  and  utilise  our  available  resources  before
embarking on new water resources  infrastructure  development  projects,  we
recognise the need to capture and store water.

I have already mentioned the De Hoop Dam, one of our leading  infrastructure
projects, but we also have an infrastructure refurbishment,  rehabilitation,
operations and maintenance  programme  in  each  province.  In  Gauteng  for
example, we are rehabilitating the Vlakfontein Canal, as part of the Usuthu-
Vaal Scheme, and will be rehabilitating the refurbishing of  our  water  and
waste-water treatment works in the Vaal River system, amongst others.

Most of the department’s current water resources infrastructure  development
projects are implemented  in  rural  areas,  particularly  in  the  Limpopo,
KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Western  Cape  provinces.  In  most  of  these
projects we ensure the involvement of women and youth.

I hope that the  hon  Chairperson  of  the  Select  Committee  on  Land  and
Environmental Affairs is using his earpiece, because this  is  the  part  he
alluded to, and he even spoke to me about it. Now you  will  be  pleased  to
hear that in the North West Province we will be undertaking a water  quality
remedial project for the Hartebeespoort Dam  with  the  assistance  of  Rand
Water. I can say a lot about this, concerning the extent of damage  in  this
dam: water pollution, the death of fish, etc. This year we will  be  working
with Rand Water to address that. [Applause.]

On water conversation and water demand management we have supported very
successful pilot projects in municipalities like Mangaung, Cape Town and
Emfuleni.]

As with water, we need to acknowledge the crucial role already played by
provincial and local government in the national forestry agenda. Many
provinces and municipalities are aware of the benefit of forestry, not just
for the social and aesthetic benefits which trees and forestry provide but,
more importantly, for the livelihood and support and economic benefit that
they provide.

In terms of economic growth and development which forestry offers, we are
working closely with other government structures in the Eastern Cape and
Kwazulu-Natal to fast-track the afforestation licensing process which
involves support from a number of other departments.

These new forestry areas will be singularly important in the transformation
and growth of the forestry sector and, as such, afforestation forms an
important part of our Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Charter, which
has been completed and agreed to with all the sectors. I plan to launch
this charter next month. This charter captures all the key national
priorities for the sector as reflected in the Accelerated and Shared Growth
Initiative of South Africa, the Joint Initiative for Priority Skills
Acquisition and the past two state of the nation addresses by our
President, which called for a strategy for the forest, timber, pulp and
paper industries.

The department has worked very closely with other departments on the
process of reducing the administrative burden on forestry development.
Applications for afforestation have increased dramatically from 800
hectares in 2004 to 5 500 hectares this year. Under the charter, we are
aiming at processing in the order of 15 000 hectares per year for the next
10 years. We have also managed to halve the original time of about 18
months to process a licence application and have plans in place to reduce
this timeframe. We are also planning to use the progressive provisions in
the National Forest Act to provide direct support to communities in this
and other forest enterprise areas. Strategic interventions such as the
establishment of the special purpose vehicle Asgisa Eastern Cape (Pty)
Limited will assist in driving implementation of the forestry programme in
these areas.

Afforestation, as you all know, will take place mostly in the rural areas
where there are very few available job opportunities and economic activity.
The development of these additional raw material resources will attract
greater processing capacity in the form of sawmills. We are going to see
the development of board mills, chipping and treatment plants, and all
these will lead to broader economic growth in those areas.

Through this afforestation, an additional R500 million per annum could be
generated on the plantations part of the industry which had a turnover of
R32 billion last year and add-in in excess of R1,5 billion per annum in
value-added processes. We are also revising and we have approved our policy
on the remaining category plan B and plan C forestry which we intend to
rehabilitate and hand over to the communities. Since the job of making
forestry to work in the economy and in the lives of poor people involves
all three spheres of government, we are finalising the implementation plan
for the forestry sector which can be used by provincial and local
governments.

I believe my department has an important role to play in the area of using
water for economic growth and contributing towards poverty eradication. It
is therefore necessary that, during the coming years, we use our budget
towards achieving these broader government objectives.

We will contribute to poverty alleviation through current initiatives such
as the Masibambane Programme, our greening programme and our support
programme to resource-poor farmers. This support will be provided through
running projects such as rain water harvesting, food gardens, planting of
fruit trees, skills development for rural women, as well as other projects
that can bring food to the table.

The majority of the Working for Water budget allocation which you see this
year will be spent in the provinces. You are very well aware what this
project has accomplished. We intend to grow this project.

My time is running out. As I conclude, I would like to thank the
Director–General of the department, Mr Jabu Sindane; the deputy directors-
general and all the officials of the department right to the last one for
their hard work and commitment. I would also like to thank the Select
Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs for the important oversight
under very difficult circumstances and with so many departments to oversee.
Again, I would like to thank you for the work that you do.

I request the House to support my department’s budget of R5,3 billion. I
thank you. [Applause.]

particularly privileged to be able to participate in this important debate
in this time of democracy. I would therefore like to highlight a couple of
facts. Water affairs, sanitation and forestry, the three of them, have to

[Chairperson, if you will allow me to say something, I would like to take
this opportunity to thank the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry for
making a decision with regard to the land at Hartebeespoort Dam. I feel
enraged when I see that place.  I would like to take this opportunity to
thank the department for taking up my challenge and request with regard to
the appalling condition of that dam.

I would like to link two points that concern your department; as it is its
responsibility to conserve the water and keep it unpolluted. Again the same
department has to make sure that sewerage is separated with clean water
because the problem with sewerage that comes through Jukskei River from
Alexandra and the nearby white areas is swept away by the river and flows
into the Hartebeespoort Dam. That is the reason that makes the situation at
that dam so unbearable.

I would like to make an appeal and request that this should not only be
done by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, but they should work
together with the Department of Environmental Affairs as pollution is their
responsibility. In Setswana we say joint efforts make the task lighter. By
so saying, we really tell the truth that indeed joint efforts make the task
lighter, that is why these two departments should work together on this
issue.

The residents of that area are watching with keen interest as to where will
they get assistance. In Makatakong, as we speak, most of the villages get
water from the lorrie tanks because there seems to be a problem with the
water pipe system that is supposed to provide water to the people.

The sewerage problem is a reality. The old Motswana was telling the truth
when he said there is an influence of external factors in a problem as it
is the case here where the problem does not emanate only from the dam, but
from the streams and rivers that flow into it. We used to believe that our
streams and rivers were unpolluted until we discovered today that their
water needs to be purified. This is an indication that our future and that
of our children is in danger. This is a challenge to us.]

The South African society of the past was characterised largely by
socioeconomic backlogs and underservicing across social groups and regions.
The regime’s policies by then left a legacy of severe economic and social
disparities, and most South African families still live in conditions that
do not meet the most basic needs.

The spiralling effects of this legacy as well as the new challenges of
economic globalisation engaged the state in developmental imbalances. A
central priority of the South African government as set out in the Bill of
Rights is to ensure the provision of a range of services to meet
socioeconomic challenges within the constraints of available resources.

One of the critical challenges that the national government faces,
therefore, is how best to redistribute national revenue, with a view to
equity and poverty alleviation. The South African government’s fiscal
system is designed to address this concern, through the assignment of
functions allocated to each sphere of government.

Many national departments, however, in their budget submissions as well as
their strategic plans, recognise challenges encountered by South Africa in
its third year of the second decade of democracy. Broadly, these include,
but are not limited to, poverty eradication and building the capacity of
the state to implement government policies in order to create a better a
life for all the people of South Africa.

The initiatives to meet these challenges are underpinned by the principles
outlined in the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative of South Africa,
Asgisa, and in the government’s programme of action. In line with the
changing role of the department, an overview of the overall expenditure
trends for the department reflects that the total expenditure decreased
from R4,3 billion in 2005-06 because of the transfer of expenditure of new
water and sanitation projects to the municipal infrastructure grant from
Programme 3: Water Services.

A lo a nkutlwa? [Do you hear me?]

HON MEMBERS: Re go reeditse! [We are listening!]

The increase in expenditure by R853,3 million between 2006-07 is due to the
allocation for the construction of De Hoop Dam – the increased allocation
for improving dam safety.

O reetse sentle! O reetse sentle morwarra! [Listen carefully! Listen
carefully, my brother!]

Funds rolled over for personnel costs related to the transfer of some of
the department’s functions include the following: disaster management
projects, drought relief, flood damage to structures and the management of
commercial forestry in the Mpumalanga area.

The revised estimates for 2006-08 show that the anticipated underspending
for the department is R794 million, owing to the delays in obtaining the
environmental approval from the Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism for De Hoop Dam and delays in finalising transfer agreements with
the municipalities regarding water schemes.

There are indeed constraints, in addition to those constraints on
development imposed by South Africa’s general aridity. Poor water quality
can also seriously limit the usage of water resources. A particular concern
is a decline in the quality of effluent discharged from many municipal
sewerage treatment works. This reflects the inadequate capacity of many
municipalities to undertake their water-related responsibilities. The
department is, however, offering as much support as possible to local
government to rectify the situation.

Inadequate management capacity in local government is also reflected in
many of the drought relief situations, and support initiatives are required
from the department ...

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Unfortunately, your time has
expired, hon member.

Rev P MOATSHE: Is it true? [Laughter.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Just look at the screen.

Rev P MOATSHE: Thank you, Chairperson, and I would also like to thank the
Minister and the department. Let’s spearhead an endeavour to turn around
the lives of the people of this country around. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C J VAN ROOYEN: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, I would like to
remind this House of the dreams of Antjie Krog, who wrote in the preamble
of the 1997 White Paper on National Water Policy for South Africa, and I
quote:


 We want the water of this country to flow into a network - reaching every
 individual – saying: Here is this water for you; take it, cherish it as
 affirming your human dignity, and nourish your humanity. With water we
 will wash away the past, we will from now on ever be bound by the blessing
 of water.


In 1994, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry inherited a set of
policies and laws that did not treat water as a fundamental right and
social priority. However, since 1994, access to water is regarded as a
basic human right. The state has assumed a constitutional duty to ensure
and protect this basic right - thus, the start of the blue revolution.

Prior to 1994, 14 million South Africans did not have access to safe water.
Twelve years later - thanks to the blue revolution - 41 million South
Africans have access to safe water.
What is more significant and important is the fact that, currently, more
than 80% of the population with access to water infrastructure enjoy access
to free basic water, which translates into 74% of the South African
population. This is truly a remarkable story, of which we can all be proud.


In 2005, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry further transformed
its role from being an implementer to a regulator and sector leader.
Therefore, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry will only be
responsible for compliance with water and sanitation regulations, and will
ensure that municipalities maintain their focus on the eradication of the
bucket system and water supply backlogs.

The question, Minister, is whether this new strategic direction is the
correct one in terms of the government’s pro-poor policies. If we consider
the current challenges and lack of capacity within municipalities, should
we not perhaps investigate whether we are not putting undue pressure on
municipalities who are already under pressure, due to the lack of capacity
and resources, to fulfil this very important and fundamental human right?
Are we not perhaps busy shifting responsibilities, notwithstanding the
current constitutional arrangement that states that water service provision
is a local government function?

To come back to the point, however, government has set for itself various
targets, which include the eradication of the remaining 106 800 buckets in
the formally established settlements by December 2007 and to supply clean
water to the remaining 14% of the population by 2008.

During last week’s provincial week programme of the NCOP, permanent
delegates from the Free State focused on progress made on the eradication
of the bucket system in Free State, where it was reported that at the end
of February 2007 about 85 000 buckets still needed to be eradicated before
the 2007 deadline.

Out of the 19 local municipalities in the province that receive allocations
from the 2007-08 budgets, 13 of them do not have any major challenge to
meet this deadline. However, hon Minister, the remaining six local
municipalities have a major challenge to comply, owing to the budget
shortfall of approximately R400 million. This could result in about 45 000
buckets not being eradicated by the targeted date of December 2007. This
fact was also confirmed by the MEC for local government during a briefing
to the portfolio committee on 8 May in Cape Town.

To further illustrate this point, during a presentation made by the
Mangaung Local Municipality to the members, it was reported that, in 2002,
the sanitation backlog was estimated at 90 000 households without adequate
sanitation. This backlog now stands at 10 793. The amount needed to
eradicate the remaining 10 000 buckets is R222 million and only R60 million
is available from the municipal infrastructure grants. The shortfall for
this municipality is therefore R162 million.

However, I am pleased to announce that the Mangaung Local Municipality has
taken a proactive initiative to seek outside sources to cover the shortfall
of R162 million. This indicates their commitment to address this inhuman
and degrading legacy of the past, and to provide a better life for all as
promised in our contract with the people. At the council meeting on 17 May
2007, the council took a resolution to cover the shortfall from outside
sources to enable them to meet this deadline.

It was distressing to note, however, that during the debate to authorise
this additional funding, members of the opposition, in particular the DA,
opposed the council’s resolution. This is yet another clear indication of
how far removed from the realities of life in the townships the opposition
is.

I was even more shocked when a member of the ACDP also opposed the
council’s resolution - them being based on Christian values and principles!
Is this type of attitude by the opposition parties not, perhaps, because
they live in areas that are not affected by the bucket system and therefore
does not affect their lives directly?

During the UN Millennium Summit of 2000 in Johannesburg, the world leaders
agreed to reduce by 50% the proportion of people without sustainable access
to drinking water by 2015. In the Free State, 89% of formal households
currently receive free basic water, which translates to 546 000 households.
[Time expired.]

Mr A WATSON: Hon Chairperson ...

... agb Ministers ... Waar’s hulle nou? O daar’s darem een. Agb Minister,
agb Voorsitter en lede, dis verblydend om te sien dat die kleurryke
geaardheid van ons voorsitter ook weerspieël word in die veeltaligheid wat
hy vandag hier aan die dag gelê het, baie dankie daarvoor. Ek wil ook graag
net vir my kollega daar, agb Van Rooyen, net sê dat die DA ten volle ten
gunste is en hard veg vir die uitwissing van die emmerstelsel en nie net
partytjies hou om dit te vier terwyl dit nog nooit gebeur het nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]

As daar wel so ’n besluit was in Mangaung dan was die DA se besluit gegrond
op grondige finansiële beginsels en nie net die uitwissing van die
emmerstelsel nie. [Applous.] Maar as hy ons in dieselfde lig as die ACDP
wil noem, seker omdat saam regeer hier in Kaapstad, wil ek vir hom sê dit
beteken nie wat die ANC sê is wat die DA sê nie. Net so min as wat die ANC
sê in Laingsburg en Beaufort-Wes is wat die DA sê. Onthou dit asseblief.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[... hon Ministers ... Where are they now? Oh, there is at least one. Hon
Minister, hon Chairperson and members, it is heartening to see that the
colourful disposition of our chairperson is also reflected in the
multilingualism that he is displaying here today. Thank you very much for
that. I would also just like to say to my colleague over there, hon Van
Rooyen, that the DA is fully in favour and fights the eradication of the
bucket system vigorously and that the DA does not only have parties to
celebrate this while it has not happened yet. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

If, indeed, such a decision was taken in Mangaung, then the DA’s decision
was based on well-founded financial principles and not only on the
eradication of the bucket system. [Applause.] But if he wants to mention us
and the ACDP in one breath, most probably because we govern Cape Town
jointly, I want to say to him that it does not mean that the ANC is saying
what the DA says. Just the same as what the ANC is saying in Laingsburg and
Beaufort-West, is not what the DA is saying. Please bear that in mind.
[Interjections.]]

But, as the newly-transformed water regulator and sector leader, the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry still bears ultimate
responsibility for reaching basic water supply and sanitation targets for
all by 2008 and 2010 respectively - and not the DA.

Meanwhile, the eradication of the bucket system will be helped along
immeasurably if waterborne sewerage systems could be established without
incapacitating incidents resulting from bad planning. Mpumalanga recently
witnessed such an incident when a lack of connection for a newly-
established waterborne system meant that there was no sanitation in place
at all and temporary measures had to be put in place. Of course, I am
referring, once again, to the situation at Embalenhle near Secunda, in
Govan Mbeki municipality, where, regrettably, even the temporary measures
have not been sufficient but still the system does not work.

At the workshop here in Parliament last year, which was sponsored by this
very department and the Department of Provincial and Local Government, I
was shouted down as a liar when I raised the question of eMbalenhle, but
the situation remains a shocking reality even today. Yes, hon Minister, the
bucket system has been eradicated now in extension 18 at eMbalenhle, but it
has been replaced by nothing. Is that good? [Interjections.] If that’s
good, I understand your thinking.

First there was a problem with the overflowing of temporary toilets. That
was attended to but now the waterborne toilets are overflowing because of
the malfunctioning of the sewerage system. I am informed that the
underground piping was laid at an upwards angle, so the gravity-fed
drainage simply could not work. Those underground pipes are now filled to
capacity, so the whole sewage can only go one way: out of the top of the
toilet. The sad part is that the preferred contractor - and listen to this
now - responsible for this mess was paid in full and in advance, and has
now disappeared.

Therefore, the damage remains unattended, while some of the inhabitants
still have no toilets at all. As if this terrible health hazard is not
enough ... [Interjections.] You can talk as much as you like. If you
support what is happening there, go to eMbalenhle and tell them that. Mr
Goeieman, go and tell them that the ANC and the NCOP are happy that the
people in Mpumalanga have no toilets at all. Go and tell them, don’t tell
me. [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Hon member, are you rising on a
point of order? [Interjections.]

Mr A WATSON: No, question time is later on and to the hon Minister. As if
this terrible health hazard is not enough, the situation grows even dimmer.
People have now resorted to their own makeshift bucket systems. They are
back to the bucket system of their own, using their own containers of
whatever kinds and emptying these into the nearby river which ultimately
flows into the Vaal Dam. It is not a happy story at all.

Last week in Mpumalanga, I also drew the attention of the newly-appointed
MEC for local government about this sad event. I am convinced of her
sincerity and shock. I am therefore sure that she will react shortly.
Ngqonggoshe, angazi ukuthi leli hhovisi lakho elise-Secunda lenzani ngoba
kudala sikhala kodwa abenzi lutho. Mhlawumbe wena ungabavakashela ukuze
ufike uzwe ukuthi benzani eSecunda ngoba lawa mathoyilethi awalungile,
namanzi awalungile kanti futhi abantu bayasokola. (Translation of isiZulu
paragraph follows.)

[Minister, I am not too sure what your office in Secunda is doing because
since time immemorial we have been complaining, but nothing is being done.
Maybe you have to visit them and find out what it is that they are doing in
Secunda, because the toilets there are not functional, the water is not
potable and the people are suffering.]

Of course, bulk infrastructure capacity constraints often mean that
waterborne sewage systems are overstretched, resulting in untreated sewage
spilling into storm water systems and natural water systems –wherever that
occurs, not only in Secunda. It is therefore most disturbing that issues
concerning drinking water quality and water pollution are being reported
with increasing frequency. In many rural areas such as Mpumalanga and
Limpopo, I have received reports of people having taps next to their houses
but nothing emanating from them. Those are white elephants standing there
doing nothing, and I can take you there.

South Africa’s water quality currently rates highly and it would be sad if
the situation had to deteriorate to the point where citizens, who can
afford to do so, and private businesses, had to purchase their own water
purification and sanitation systems, in addition to running their own
electricity generators. [Interjections.]

I wish Mr Goeieman would go and sit on his seat, because he is making a lot
of unnecessary noise. But I have grown used to him as an empty bucket, just
like the toilets which are not working. [Interjections.] [Applause.] I am
addressing you, not anybody else.

In Afrikaans is daar ’n baie goeie gesegde, mnr Goeieman wat standhou met
water en dit is: [There is a very fine saying in Afrikaans, Mr Goeieman,
that has relevance to water, and that is:]


Leë pyp, maak toe jou kraan, dan sien ons jou dalk vir ’n volle aand. [If
you remain silent, you will not expose your ignorance.]

[Laughter.]

No, I have already said that I won’t take questions. You have attempted to
waste my time a few times. [Interjections.] Your attempts to waste my time
are futile. They are as futile and as unhealthy as you. [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Hon Tolo, can you please take your
seat?

Mnr A WATSON: U sien, Voorsitter, ek het verwag dat daar nou weer reaksie
gaan wees en ek weet die lede van die Huis gaan nou weer sê dat ek onlojaal
teenoor my provinsie is. Ek wil tog die Huis herinner dat die lede van die
DA net soos alle ander partye wat in hierdie Huis verteenwoordig is,
alhoewel hulle deel is van ’n provinsiale afvaardiging, is deel van daardie
afvaardiging op grond van die stemme wat hul partye in die provinsie gekry
het. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Daarom moet die Voorsitter en al die lede baie mooi verstaan die DA is nie
onderdanig aan ’n provinsiale afvaardiging nie, maar aan die kiesers wat
vir ons gestem het. [Applous.] [Tussenwerspels.] Twee miljoen. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A WATSON: You see, Chairperson, I expected that there would be some
reaction and I know that the members of the House are going to say that I
am being disloyal towards my province. I would like to remind the House
that the members of the DA, like all other parties represented here in this
House, although part of a provincial delegation, are part of that
delegation on the basis of the votes their parties received in the
province.
[Interjections.]

That is why the Chairperson and all the members should clearly understand
that the DA is not accountable to a provincial delegation, but to the
voters that elected them. [Applause.] [Interjections.] All two million of
them.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, in terms of the Rules of this
House, a member must address the Chair, not the members directly. That hon
member pointed a finger like the late former State President. I think he
must address the Chair.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Can you please continue, hon
member.

Mr A WATSON: Thank you, Chair, for not acknowledging that nonsense. I was
trying to say ... [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Hon Watson, I didn’t say you must
say that is nonsense. You have to withdraw that statement.

Mr A WATSON: I am not saying it is nonsense. I am not saying you said it is
nonsense. I think it is nonsense. But I withdraw, because I am wasting my
own time. [Interjections.]

Agb Voorsitter, ek wil net weer herhaal, ons sal kyk na die probleme en die
wense van ons kiesers en nie na ’n provinsiale delegasie se leier of sy
provinsie nie. Ons is hier om na ons kiesers te kyk en ons sal sorg dat ons
lawaai maak oor plekke soos eMbalenhle vir solank as wat ons kan en vir
solank as wat ons wil. Ek dan u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, I would just like to repeat once again, we will look at
the problems and the concerns of our voters and not at a leader of a
provincial delegation or his province. We are here to take care of our
voters and we shall make sure that we make a fuss about places such as
eMbalenhle for as long as we are able to and for as long as we would like
to. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnu M A MZIZI: Sihlalo noNgqongoqshe, impela namhlanje bekungadingekile
ukuthi silokhu sijikijelana ngamagama, nanoma ngani enye, ngoba sikhuluma
ngento ebalulekile, amanzi namahlathi. Amanzi namahlathi ayimpilo kithi
sonke. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson and hon Minister, today, there is really no need
for us to throw tantrums at each other, or any other object for that
matter, because we are talking about a very important thing here; water and
forestry. Water and forestry are life to us all.]

The debate for the day deals with the commodities that are essential to the
lives of human beings, even to the creatures living under the sun. The IFP
is aware of the engagement of the department in water resources management.
It is true that effective management of water, which is a scarce resource
in South Africa, is pivotal for equity, distribution and access.

We welcome the department’s putting in place new institutional management
for water resource management which will be decentralised to regional and
local levels for greater public participation and improved efficiency. The
IFP also welcomes the continuity of the laws that protect the forests.

Lapha-ke sengikhuluma ngesihlahla esisanda kutholakala laphaya eLimpopo.
Kufanele sisithezelwe futhi sivikeleke ngokusemthethweni leso sihlahla. [I
am talking here about the tree that was  recently discovered in Limpopo.
That tree must be concealed and be protected by law.]

If this is not done, some of these trees would be extinct. The incoming
generation would not know about certain plants that had lived and provided
human beings with life.

Nezinye izihlahla ezilungisa umuzi, ezaziwa uhlanga oluthile lwabanye
bomdabu, nazo lezo zihlahla zidinga ukuthi zivikeleke. [And the other
trees, too, which are famous for aphrodisiac reasons, to a certain black
ethnic grouping, must also be protected.] [Laughter.]

I wish to touch on one little point that the IFP would like to see being
improved on, in order for people at large to benefit. The following area
needs attention: lack of hygienic drinking water supply in the rural areas.
Water is scarce because the very same river where they fetch water for
drinking is also where they do their laundry. And, because the river flows
from the other side, someone is taking a bath while animals are also
drinking the same water. Such water is not sterilised for human
consumption.

As regards sanitation in rural areas, especially in an educational
environment, most schools in the rural areas use toilets which don’t flush
because in most areas they do not have sewerage systems. These toilets are
dangerous to the community and schoolchildren as well.

Angazi-ke Ngqongqoshe ngoba laphaya endaweni engibuya kuyo,
ngaseBekkersdal, kusasetshenziswa zona lezi zindlu zangasese zomgodi.
Ziyinsakavukela umchilo wesidwaba; wena-ke owakubona kwenzeka lokho.
[Minister, I do not know what will happen in my area because near
Bekkersdal people are still using the pit toilets. They are commonly used,
as you know.]

There should be black ownership and supply of timber and contracted
services to the sector, especially by women etc. The black-owned component
is largely limited. There is about 8% of planted forests, and black women-
owned companies are few. Forests contribute significantly to the economy,
both directly and indirectly. Formal and commercial forestry alone
contributes 2% to the GDP. There is a lack of water for economic
development activities, such as irrigation systems for watering food
gardens.

Ngqongqoshe, ngike ngathinteka lapha uma ukhuluma ngabakushayela ucingo
bekhuluma ngamanzi anukayo. Angazi ukuthi basuke bekhuluma ngamaphi amanzi.
Kodwa laphaya eSt Johns, ikhona indawo ebizwa ngokuthi, “amanzi anukayo”.
Lawo ngamanzi aziwayo impela. Kuthiwa uma ufika khona noma ngabe uphethwe
yisiphi isifo, uma ungena kuwo siyaphela isifo. Uma uphuza lawo manzi
anukayo, kuyaphola lokho okukuphethe. Ngibona sengathi lawo manzi kudingeka
avikelwe ngoba ayikhambi. Abaningi abakwazi lokho kodwa abanye bahlala
khona eSt Johns. Iyani khona nina enigulayo ukuze nibone ukuthi imvelo
ikuphi.

Angisike elijikayo. Yebo, indaba yamanzi imqoka kodwa laphaya emalokishini,
lawa manzi okuthiwa siwathola simahla, empeleni asiwaboni ezitatimendeni
zethu. [Ubuwelewele.] Hawu madoda, kanti isikhathi siyisitha nakimi?
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Minister, I was deeply touched when you were talking about people who
telephone you alerting you about the stinking water. I do not know which
water they are referring to here. But in St Johns, there is a place
referred to as “stinking water”. That water is generally known by people.
They say if you get inside this water, no matter what you are suffering
from, you are immediately cured. If you drink that stinking water, your
illness is cured. I believe this water must be protected because it serves
as a remedy. Many do not know that, but they live there at St Johns. You,
who are sick, go there so that you can see what nature can do for you.

In conclusion, let me say, indeed the water issue is very important
particularly in the townships, there is water which is said to be free, but
we do not see that in our bills for water consumption. [Interjections.]
Alas, good people, is time an enemy to me, too?]

                MOTION MOVED ON 29 MARCH 2007 BY MR A WATSON

                                  (Ruling)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon members, before I proceed to
call upon the next speaker, I would like to bring to your attention the
ruling that I reserved on 29 March 2007. It was in the matter between the
Chief Whip of the Council, hon Windvoël, and the hon Watson.

The ruling goes as follows: I would like to make a ruling on the
reservations I made to a motion that was moved by hon Watson and objected
to by the Chief Whip of the Council, on the basis that parties had agreed
not to move motions without notice, if such motions are politically
controversial.

I would therefore like to warn that any agreement between members and
parties, which was not and has not been sanctioned by the House or endorsed
by the House, will not have any binding effect on the House. However,
parties are encouraged to adhere to any agreement they may have entered
into within the structures of Parliament.

On that basis, I therefore rule that the motion without notice moved by hon
Watson and objected to by the hon Chief Whip of the Council will become a
notice of motion. Thank you.

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Mnr die Voorsitter, in die Vrystaat is die Departement
van Waterwese baie traag om die toekenning van waterregte te finaliseer.
Dit sal baie goed wees as die agb Minister op ’n dringende basis daaraan
kan aandag gee. Dit het ’n baie nadelige effek. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Hon Chairperson, the Department of Water Affairs in
the Free State has been dragging its feet in finalising the awarding of
water rights. It would be very useful if the hon Minister could intervene
as a matter of extreme urgency. It has a rather negative effect.]

The guide to the National Water Act provides for protecting the health of
the water resource, and this refers in particular to the quality thereof.
It further provides for pollution prevention and makes it obligatory for
any person to report to the police any accident or incident of water
pollution. Failure to do that would be a crime.

In a recent report by the National Biodiversity Institute, it was found
that 82% of South Africa’s rivers are being endangered by pollution and 42%
thereof are critical, mostly because the sewerage systems, particularly
their purification schemes, are collapsing in many parts of the country.

Shockingly, it was reported last week that the Minister said that the
government would not crack down, legally, on municipalities that failed to
prevent water pollution if the local authority lacked capacity to comply.
The hon Minister is a lawyer herself and she would know that the law of
contract has a maxim “impossibility of performance”, which applies. In
certain circumstances, a person will not be held to a contract if it is
impossible to perform its contractual duties. However, self-created
impossibility is no excuse.

The municipalities and government created the lack of capacity themselves
by getting rid of competent people and employing incompetent ones, through
bad planning, political games, refusing to upgrade or maintain sewerage
systems, and ignoring the pleas to do so. In addition, performance must be
impossible, not merely difficult or costly. The department’s reasoning,
therefore, is shocking and shows its unwillingness to protect our scarce
water resources.

It’s hard for me to believe that the Minister really had this attitude.
Maybe she was reported wrongly. I think today she has now the opportunity
to put it right, because I can’t, in my wildest dreams, think that the
Minister would be so unwilling to support municipalities not to comply with
the Act. Thank you, Chairperson.

Ms B L MATLHOAHELA: Chairperson, I greet the hon Ministers and all members
in the House. As we all know, water and trees are essential for the
existence of mankind. Green trees and green vegetables absorb the carbon
dioxide for the production of oxygen. On the other hand, trees serve as a
heating substance for the poorest of the poor. When the poorest of the poor
are gathering wood, they can be arrested. How do we deal with this
situation in its own unique way?

It is winter right now. The heart of the ID goes out to these people.
Preservation of forestry is essential, also within the context of global
warming. Do we keep the balance in a health way between using forestry for
economic use and the survival of humankind?

I need to bring to the attention of the hon Minister the lack of water in
some places in the Northern Cape, where 3 000 people depend on nine taps
for their water consumption. We again find that in other settlements water
runs throughout the night and day from leaking taps. What measures are
taken to preserve such water which is wasted? This is observed by those who
pay the revenue in this country. These contradictory situations need to be
given attention.

During the provincial week of May 2007, it came to the attention of the
Northern Cape delegation that the Phokwane Municipality at Hartswater was
in debt of R15 million for water. This amount was payable to the Sedibeng
Water Board. The above-mentioned municipality is not in a financial
position to level this debt. Due to this situation, the municipality cannot
supply a water service to the community. We humbly request the attention of
the hon Minister regarding the situation. This municipality earnestly needs
assistance. This debt has been outstanding since 1996. Thank you, hon
Chairperson.

Ms B N DLULANE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister ...

... amalungu ngokubanzi, Tat’ uWatson, ndisivile isikhalo sakho mna wakwa-
ANC, kodwa bendiza kukucebisa ukuba, kuba uMphathiswa kunye nesebe lakhe
belapha, uthethe naye. Kambe ndiyakhumbula ukuba kule komiti sikuyo
sobabini sinengxaki enkulu malunga nokutshitshiswa kwamabhakethi
asetyenziswa njengemizi yangasese. Sonke ekomitini savumelana ukuba sibuze
kuMphathiswa ukuba ngaba akukho nto ingenziwa na. Ingxaki yaseMpumalanga
uyiphakamisile yaza yaphendulwa. Sachaza ukuba sinengxaki yokuba la
mabhakethi awazibandakanyi iindawo ezingamatyotyombe. Uyiphakamisile
iSecunda. Ndifuna ukuba uMphathiswa ayive ... (Translation of isiXhosa
paragraph follows.)

[... Members at large, Mr Watson, as an ANC member, I heard your concern,
but I was going to advise you that, since the Minister and her department
are here, you speak to her. However, I acknowledge that in the committee to
which both of us belong, we have a big problem regarding the eradication of
the bucket system. We all agreed in the committee that we should ask the
Minister if there is anything that can be done. You raised the problem of
Mpumalanga and a response was given. We explained that the problem
regarding the bucket system is that they do not include the informal
settlements ... You made mention of Secunda. I want the Minister to hear it
..]

... just because, when you were addressing this, there was a lot of noise
in this House. I suppose there is a formal bucket system at Secunda. That
thing must be taken to the Minister so that she can investigate it,
together with the MEC. According to the report on the eradication of the
bucket system, we have been told in the committee that there are only three
provinces that require attention, which are Free State, Northern Cape and
Eastern Cape. Mpumalanga was not mentioned.

However, we must not correct things in an incorrect manner in this debate.
We must raise the point by saying that if it’s not correct, it was wrong
information from the national department. That report came from the
national department and it stated that there were about three provinces.
But if it’s not so, Minister, this is your time to tell us, as this House,
about what is happening in Mpumalanga.

The aim of this budget is to push back the frontiers of poverty and close
the gap that has been created in the past, of resources concentrated in
urban areas. Water availability means a change of life in the remote areas
and economic activity that will benefit people who had been drinking in the
same river or well with pigs, goats, donkeys and cattle. I do have an
experience about what I’m saying. This is the past that we are not proud
of, which resulted from apartheid.

A significant allocation from this budget has to make sure that the people
of this country in the rural areas no longer drink with goats in the same
river. It must make sure that the reservoirs don’t run dry. It is
embarrassing to see that, when our people open taps, nothing comes out of
the tap.

Our budget of R5,3 billion is allocated to this department this year to
address what I have mentioned. It means that our government cares. I must
confirm that even though there are those taps, the department cannot make
water run in those taps without enough budget.
In this budget there is an increase of R400 million for water and
sanitation for this financial year and a further R620 million in the next
financial year. I’m hoping that the caring organisation, which is the
caring government, is trying to address whatever problems we inherited in
the apartheid era. That’s why we are saying that there are still those
problems. Without this budget and without the caring government, we cannot
outdo the apartheid regime’s budgets, which only focused on those who have,
while those who don’t have did not have such budgets.

In this financial year, a budget allocation of R1,9 billion has been set
aside for water and sanitation. I believe that this allocation was made
because water, sanitation and hygiene are vital components of sustainable
development and alleviation of poverty.

Our government has been confronted with a situation in which not only have
the majority of people in this country been excluded from the land, but
they have also been denied either direct access to water and sanitation or
productive use of and access to the resources. That’s why there are still
these problems. Those who benefited from the apartheid regime are today
making remarks when I say that there are still taps without water. This is
because we have a huge backlog which comes from those who did benefit
during the apartheid days.

There is only so much water that falls on our land every year. We need to
engage ourselves in debates that can help us come up with feasible
strategies to manage these resources. I want to commend the Minister and
her department for the pleasing work they have done so far in the area of
water resource management and bucket system eradication interventions, more
especially in the Eastern Cape.

We did call public hearings on this matter, and very few people who still
make use of the bucket systems in the formal settlements or those old four-
roomed houses that were given to us by the then bosses, attended the
hearings.

Regarding the Free State and the Northern Cape, as we have said, we were
pleased that all those three MECs attended to your call. Surely, they have
promised that by December 2007 they will be finished with that. However,
the outstanding ones need your intelligence, Minister. I don’t know whether
you can change the policy that has been formulated. I, Beauty, am saying
this as a member of the ANC, because I do have complaints that I have
received from my constituency concerning the definition of this thing. That
doesn’t mean that you are not doing anything, but there are still buckets
which were not budgeted for in this financial year. We are pleading that we
must look at this thing.

Another exciting development we have seen this year is the commencement of
the construction of the De Hoop Dam in Limpopo, which was launched on 19
March this year. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon members, before I call upon the
hon Minister to reply to the debate, I want to make a plea concerning the
fact that, for the entire duration of the debate, the hon Minister has
respectfully listened to all of you, without interjecting or showing either
approval or disapproval. My observation is that there is a tendency by some
amongst us, who find it to be a good thing when Ministers reply to the
debate, to heckle and interject when they don’t like certain things. I want
to plead and warn in advance that such behaviour is not going to be
tolerated.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Malibongwe! Chairperson, I
would like to, at the very outset, thank hon members for their lively
participation in this debate.

I have noted the chairperson’s remarks around the responsibility of the
department to ensure that our water resources are managed and kept clean.
It is very important for hon members to note that most of the problems in
this area are problems of capacity in municipalities to manage and maintain
their infrastructure. We are working to ensure that that capacity is built
in the municipalities, as this infrastructure was initially the
infrastructure of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry and was
transferred. We are building capacity and we are moving towards a stage
where we are going to be very tough on the municipalities.

I would like to say we have more information on the Hartebeespoort Dam and
the exciting work that is going on there. However, time won’t allow me to
deal with all of it. In conjunction with that point, I would like to go
straight to the two points raised by hon Van Heerden. The first one deals
with the process of allocation of water rights in the area where he comes
from. I would want the FF to actually assist us to release water - most of
which is in the hands of people who used to own land – in order for us to
distribute it to people who had no water rights. That is the biggest
challenge we are facing. We would want them to assist us in getting water
rights allocated to black people who are new landowners and who are finding
it very difficult to access water from some of the farmers who do have
access and are not utilising it.

Secondly, I would like to respond to the hon Van Heerden’s point about the
state of rivers and pollution and what we are doing as a department. We
have a river health programme that is focusing on raising awareness and
protection of rivers from pollution. To top up this initiative, the
department is about to launch what we call an adopt-a-river strategy that
will see the involvement of communities and officials assisting with the
programme that parliamentarians have started by adopting and protecting
certain rivers. As a department, we are aware of the challenges concerning
old infrastructure which often leads to pollution of our dams and rivers.

This is what the hon Van Heerden said I would need to clear today. My view
is that the department has the right to take any polluter to court to make
them clean up their act, and we are working on the polluter-pays principle.
But when it comes to municipalities, before we can take those
municipalities to court we must provide them with support and guidance. Our
approach to regulation is a developmental approach, given the capacity
challenges that we find in the municipalities, as I have pointed out. I am
working to ensure that capacity is built in these areas. I am addressing
specific and particular municipalities where you find that sewage is
running into our rivers. When the time is right, we are going to come down
on those that are not cleaning up their act, including industries.

Let me now come to the second issue ... time is running out. I agree with
hon Van Rooyen. I don’t know whether the revolution is blue or green. It is
a revolution, nevertheless.

Hon Watson, congratulations for your elevation to this new position. You
know, the issues you raised about eMbalenhle are actually, I am informed,
not correct. Buckets were eradicated in the area, but they went a step
further and made sure that they removed buckets even in the informal areas.
We are not aware of any overflowing sewerage lines, because deadlines for
all work which was scheduled for completion in March were met, concerning
work on improving the sewerage system. We do get monthly reports on the
water quality in this area. We are monitoring them very closely. Therefore,
most of what you were saying here is actually not true.

What is true about eMbalenhle is that in areas where they are planning for
waterborne solutions in the future, they have in the meantime put in VIP
toilets that can be upgraded into fully waterborne systems when the water
is available. That is an ongoing project. I think this was a smaller part
of the bigger problem that they had to solve but they are dealing with it.
From where we stand, there are no buckets in this area and whatever
solutions they have put in place, I think you should appreciate the very
positive work that the municipality does in that area and what they have
done to bring sanitation to the people.

Hon Mzizi, in fact, what you mentioned is a very serious issue. I am glad
that both you and the hon member of the ID raised this issue, because
forestry is going to become even bigger and more important in the whole
scheme of things in our country. During the past year I approved a national
list of protected tree species under the National Forests Act.

As a department, we have developed guidelines for the use of these trees to
ensure the continued benefits that they offer to the people of the country,
both economically and ecologically. For the first time ever in South
Africa, we published what we call “21 championed trees”, which are then
protected under this Act. We are assisting municipalities in this area. If
trees have cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic significance, then
they can identify those for protection. If you have this tree that you are
talking about, please work around that issue with the municipality so that
it can come onto our list of protected trees.

With regard to the issue raised by the hon member of the ID around the
debts owed to the water boards, I should point out that we are working with
National Treasury to resolve this debt issue. It is money owed by the
municipalities to the water boards and this is a problem that we are facing
all over the country as we deal with the developmental nature of our
society, where the majority of our people cannot pay but the municipalities
are expected to provide a service. We are trying to maintain that balance.

Hon Dlulane raised a serious plea on this policy of buckets. Why does the
definition of the bucket system not include informal settlements? This is a
definition that was adopted for a specific reason. Here were houses built,
formally established houses, where people didn’t have proper sanitation and
the President came to a decision that this must stop in December 2007. That
is why we set up a programme and targets to ensure that no buckets will be
seen in those areas after December 2007.

It is very difficult to say that you can eradicate buckets in all informal
establishments when some of them mushroom overnight. What we need to decide
is what form of service we can take to where our people are and ensure that
growth of that kind of informal settlements is addressed by our human
settlement plan, which the Minister of Housing is driving. We must not
underestimate why this is happening - the population is growing. If you
look at the survey done by GCIS, families are becoming smaller. Younger
people are leaving home to go and live on their own. So, you have all these
informal settlements mushrooming. Over and above that, regarding our very
own good policy of providing RDP houses to people, people believe that they
must be in the informal settlements to get onto the register of getting an
RDP house. That also encourages people to move to these informal
settlements.

From our view, we are going to eradicate the buckets in all formal
established settlements this year and the rest of the informal settlements
must be addressed by the human settlement programme. We must also recognise
that we have agreed to give universal access to all these services for our
people – Water 2008 and Sanitation 2010. So, as we move towards our
universal access sanitation programme, we are also going to address those
areas that were raised as areas of concern.

Hon Chairperson, I am informed that I have 38 seconds left. I just want to
very quickly deal with the Free State because two people raised the issue
of Free State. In the Free State we have been working very closely
regarding the eradication of the bucket system. We are working with local
government and with the provincial government. We have assessed, together
with the departments, any funding shortfalls and we are going to assist
with allocating funding to certain municipalities in the Free State. The
province is also facilitating access to external funding in those
municipalities and discussions with the DBSA are going ahead in this
regard. Some municipalities have also gone ahead and looked for funding
outside of their own budgets.

The most important intervention that the municipalities have agreed to do
is to implement technology within the available funding. If you look at
that R400 million that the Free State said they were short of, the fact of
the matter is that they were talking about having full waterborne systems,
even in areas where they knew there would be no water this year. If the
area does not have water to provide waterborne systems, they have to put in
place something that would enable them to provide proper sanitation to the
people in the area – and not buckets. As we move towards universal access
and if we provide the infrastructure for water and pipelines, and the
sewerage treatment plants that would be needed; and if there are more
people using the waterborne system, they should provide the water. It is
advisable that municipalities take up this VIP system that can be upgraded.
We have seen it in many areas of our country. Thank you, hon members.
[Applause.]
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Order! Hon members, on your behalf,
I think I must formally extend our gratitude to the hon Minister for
providing leadership and inspiration to this august House, particularly
against the background of the past weeks’ engagement by this House on this
specific topic of bucket eradication within our provinces.

I think the debates were more helpful and informative and members will be
able to go back to their provinces and counter-check some of the facts that
are provided by the national department. The hon Minister is the only chief
executive of that department and no information can be correct except what
comes from her. Therefore, I think it was helpful. On that note, hon
members, that concludes the debate and the business of the day.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 15:48.
