                    SPRINGBOK VICTORY IN RUGBY WORLD CUP

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move:

   That the House -


      1) congratulates the Springbok rugby team on winning the 2007 IRB
         World Cup;


      2) expresses its appreciation to the team for its part in making
         Saturday, 20 October 2007, a memorable occasion;
      3) acknowledges that the Springbok’s victory united the country; and


      4) expresses the hope that South Africa will retain the World Cup in
         2011.


Mr T D LEE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. While today is about the Springboks,
we must not forget the Cheetahs who are the Curry Cup champions of South
Africa. [Applause.]

Madam Speaker, on Saturday, 20 October, I sat with my family in Port
Elizabeth, the home town of Alistair Coetzee, watching the Springboks play
the final match in the Rugby World Cup. It was my sister’s fiftieth
birthday and what a birthday present. I will always remember where I was
that night, because that is how we as humans commemorate great moments in
our lives, with strong and unyielding passion, with the memory of the event
that never fades away.

That was a great moment in South Africa’s history. To the Springboks, to
the support team and to you, Jake White, we will honour you and we will
miss you when are you no longer the coach of our team. I salute you!
[Applause.]

In die DA, glo ons daaraan, dat jy op verdienste in  ‘n  span  moet  kom  en
weet ons dat al hierdie spelers op verdienste in die span is. [Applous.]

Ons weet dat julle danksy julle  ingebore  en  later  vertroetelde  talente,
sover gevorder het en ook danksy skole wat julle potensiaal  raakgesien  het
en julle gedruk het om dit  te  verwesenlik.  Die  span  wat  na  verdienste
gekies is, het die belangrikste rugbytoernooi ter wệreld gewen.

Gevolglik was daar ‘n massiewe opwelling van positiewe emosie en ‘n
gebeurtenis met min gelyke in Suid-Afrika se geskiedenis, wat almal verenig
het. Daarenteen is daar voorstaanders van kwotas wat glo dat ras moet
bepaal watter keuses Suid-Afrikaners moet maak. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The DA believes that a person should be included in a team on merit and  we
know  that  all  these  players  have  earned  their  place  in  the   team.
[Applause.]

We know that they got as far as they did thanks to their inborn talents,
which were developed later, thanks to the schools that spotted their
potential and pushed them to realise that potential. The team, which was
chosen on merit, won the most important rugby tournament in the world.

Consequently there was an enormous upsurge  of  positive  emotions,  and  an
event with few equals in South Africa’s history, which united  everyone.  On
the other hand, there are those who favour quotas,  who  believe  that  race
should determine the choices South Africans must make.]

Many of those people who fervently call for quotas are sitting here today
... [Interjections.] ... basking in your glory - the very institution they
have actively fought to undermine. Jake, there is no doubt that success has
many fathers but failure is an orphan. Now the question South Africa needs
to ask in the light of this triumph is: Do we want to limit our choices by
focusing on race, as the ANC believes we should ... [Interjections.] ... or
should we strive to be the best we can, like the Springboks?

If we want to be the best, then the government needs to support us and
provide us with opportunities so that we can make the choices that we want
to make.

Prof B TUROK: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: What the speaker is doing
is dividing the House when it should be united. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER:  Hon member that is not a point of order. The hon member is
expressing a view.

Mnr T D LEE: Suid-Afrika se mense is die enigistes wat kan besluit watter
een van die twee opsies hulle wil hệ. ‘n Mens hoop dat die Springbokke se
oorwinning sal help om daardie keuse makliker te maak. As ek so na die
opwelling kyk, het die mense die keuse gemaak. Julle het self gesien hoe
mal die mense in die strate oor julle was - en nou verwys ek na die
Springbokke. Julle het ‘n beker en heldestatus huis toe gebring en dit met
julle optrede, onder al die mense in hierdie ... (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr T D LEE: The citizens of South  Africa  are  the  only  people  who  can
decide which of the two options they prefer. One hopes that the  Springbok’s
victory will help to  make  that  choice  easier.  When  one  considers  the
upsurge of emotions it is clear that the people have made their choice.  You
saw for yourselves how crazy the people in the streets were about you –  and
now I am referring to the Springboks. You brought  home  a  trophy  and  the
status of heroes and spread it among all the people ...]

The CHIEF WHIP  OF  THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  is  the  speaker
prepared to take a question?

Mr T D LEE: At the end I will take any question, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: He is left with six seconds.

Mr T D LEE: Julle het ‘n beker en heldestatus huis toe gebring en dit met
julle optrede onder al die mense in hierdie land versprei. Danksy julle, is
almal in Suid-Afrika vandag helde. Baie dankie. [Applous.] [You brought
home a trophy and the status of heroes and spread it among all the people
in this country. Thanks to you, everyone in South Africa is a hero today.
Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Madam Speaker, thank you very much for allowing us this
special sitting in the National Assembly today, in honour of our rugby
team. It is indeed a privilege to have them in our midst.

Four years ago, Jake White announced to South Africa and the world, as he
took over the reins of the rugby team, that his dream and goal was to lead
the South African rugby team to World Cup glory in 2007.

His goal wasn’t going to be an easy one to achieve and the road ahead was
going to be a difficult one, but he never lost focus on what he wanted to
accomplish. His methodology was to nurture and develop a bunch of highly
talented young rugby players, while drawing on the experience of the old
hands in his team. He made the Springboks a family, a collective, the proud
team they are today. [Applause.]

Throughout his four-year term as a Springbok coach, rugby also remained the
ultimate political topic, a frequent target of our frustration with the
pace of transformation. Six months before the World Cup, the hon Butana
Komphela even threatened to withhold the passports of the Springbok team
because the squad did not reflect transformation sufficiently. But Mr
Komphela and the IFP knew very well that transformation was not the
responsibility of rugby players, but rugby administrators.

However, every dark cloud has a silver lining. Mr Komphela is a constant
thorn in rugby’s side, but the Springboks even managed to get Mr Komphela
on their side as he was seen in Paris, wearing his rugby T-shirt and
cheering on the Amabokoboko. [Applause.]

And this is probably the most significant achievement of this World Cup
victory in France. It has shown us how powerful sport is as a nation
builder. We must take note and build on this wonderful experience.

As South Africa lifted the Webb Ellis Cup on 20 August 2007, at braais and
gathering places across this beautiful country of ours, we South Africans,
black or white, IFP or ANC, PAC or FF Plus, rich or poor, forgot our
differences and stood as one to celebrate as a nation. [Applause.]

As Andrew Molefe, a Sowetan reporter, so beautifully puts it:

   Colour didn’t matter. We hugged, cried and kissed across racial lines.
   Our collective blood was green.
I would like to end with this special tribute to John Smit, Jake White and
the boys by repeating the words of our leader, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
who, following our dazzling World Cup victory, said:


   All South Africans are today justly proud of the Springboks. Quite
   simply, they represent the best of us.

Viva, Amabokoboko, viva! You represent the best of us! [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order:  As this
Parliament makes laws, I propose that we immediately make a law that Mr
Jake White remains the coach of the Springboks. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Van der Merwe, you are trying to sneak that one in from
behind. [Laughter.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Speaker, hon members and our esteemed guests, the
South African national rugby team, the Springboks; the Springboks will by
now have some inkling of what their achievement has meant for all South
Africans. If they had any doubt, then the welcome at the airport and the
subsequent street parades culminating in Cape Town yesterday would have
convinced them that as a nation we are overjoyed with their victory.

I hope to emphasise to them that when we salute their victory it is not
merely a question of our celebrating a success, but also celebrating the
manner in which they achieved their success. We are celebrating not just
the final winning score when the whistle was blown, but also the way in
which you sang the national anthem before the first whistle was blown. We
celebrate the sportsmanship you displayed on and off the field.

We celebrate because you have achieved a remarkable feat not only because
you are talented, but because you worked hard. The dedication that went
into preparing for the tournament and the obvious dedication that went into
every single game was a display of a work ethic.

We need to thank the coach for delivering what he promised, for keeping a
cool head and for executing a strategy that was four years in the making.
We also need to single out the captain for his display of quite example-
driven leadership.

It is important that this team understands that we are not just happy that
they won rather, we, as a nation, are filled with a deep sense of pride
about the way they won, to know that people abroad will think of us as a
nation possessing such qualities.

It is wonderful to see our boys competing on the international stage and
showing the whole world the qualities that we, as a nation, aspired to -
tenacity, teamwork, sportsmanship, humility and so much more.

I want to assure this team that when South Africans hail you as heroes it
is because we realise that you are human, you get hurt and bleed just like
the rest of us. Many a South African child has been inspired by watching
the captain getting stitches and returning to the field, or Percy strapping
his knee and still kicking three vital penalties. It is your humanity that
makes us admire your achievement so highly. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I think Mr Jake White
must bring the cup down here so that we can touch it. I promise you, nobody
will steal it. [Interjections.] Shut up!

I also want to apologise that I never came to Paris to watch you beat the
English Roses. I also want to thank the team, the coach and administrators.
You all made us proud.

When I was a little girl growing up in Beaufort West, I always wanted to
play rugby - to also take on the boys like I’ve taken them on in the
classroom - but then I didn’t grow big enough to make it into the Springbok
team, but decided to come to Parliament and tackle them here with my mouth.

I had the honour of watching the rugby game with Chester Williams and his
family and I learned quite a lot that night. You should have seen the sense
of relief on Chester Williams’ face when the final whistle blew. You have
made us proud.

You are the only team that was playing there not only to win, but also to
play for a vision. The pressure on you must have been tremendous and yet
you emerged victorious.

I think over the past week that you’ve been going around the country you
must have noticed it in the eyes of the supporters how we feel about our
team. Whether rich or poor, black, white or coloured, they understood that
you are the proof that when we stand together as a nation, we can overcome
anything. [Applause.]

We face so many challenges and we must savour this great moment of victory
and take strength from the fact that the vision of a unified nation is
attainable in South Africa.

To Mr Jake White, the coach, I want to salute you for everything, and on
behalf of the ID, I want to wish you a bright future. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, it is an exceptional privilege for me to
thank our national rugby team, the Springboks, for once again putting South
Africa on the international map as a winning sporting country. Your
convincing win over England in the World Cup final inspired our nation as a
whole, and in particular the Proteas and Bafana Bafana. There was a time
when it seemed that our Proteas were losing against the Pakistani side, but
I believe it was because of your example and inspiration that they turned
their game around and brought another trophy home.

Springboks, your preparation for the World Cup, your training, your
dedication, your willingness to give it your all, and to take the knocks,
has meant so much to us as a nation. You truly behaved and conducted
yourselves as professionals and ambassadors, and for that we salute you.

I specifically want to congratulate the coach, Jake White, for a job well
done and for silencing his critics. Sir, the fact that you led the
Springboks to victory in spite of the criticism, ridicule and even
condemnation that was unfairly levelled against you, makes you a very
special man and one of the best rugby coaches in the world. [Applause.] If
this Assembly had the right to vote for a rugby coach, then I believe an
overwhelming majority would have retained you. [Applause.]

Lastly, to see you all as a team, bowing before the Lord, thanking him for
the victory after your splendid performance, made you God’s champions, and
that has been the greatest blessing to me. You are our heroes; you are our
champions; you are our esteemed ambassadors. May the Lord continue to keep
and bless you all, including your families. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Agb Speaker, namens die Vryheidsfront Plus, ons gelukwense
en dank aan die Springbokspan. Ek het ‘n boodskap vir elke Springbok, maar
kan in twee minute net by enkeles uitkom. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the FF Plus, our
congratulations and thanks to the Springbok team. I have a message for each
and every Springbok, but will only get to a few of them in the two minutes
at my disposal.]

To Jake White, the coach who put up with a lot of criticism, I wish to
quote the American President Lincoln, who also had to put up with a lot of
criticism. He said:

   I do the very best I know how, the very best I can. If the end brings me
   out wrong, then angels swearing I was right would make no difference. If
   the end brings me out all right, what was said against me won’t amount to
   anything.

Ek dink aan Percy Montgomery, wat, ek dink, die speler van die toernooi
moet wees. Toe ek sien hoe hy onder die hoë skoppe van Jonny Wilkinson moes
deurloop, het ek aan die woorde van die oud-Springbok, Basie Viviers,
gedink, wat jare terug gesê het:
   Flyhalves wat baie skop, maak die fullbacks baie beroemd.

Aan Bryan Habana, rugbyspeler van die jaar, wil ek ‘n aangepaste Vorster-
storie vertel. [Applous.] Op die lughawe bestorm ‘n jong man my en vra of
ek Pieter Mulder, leier van die Vryheidsfront Plus is. Hy sê hy het baie
waardering vir wat ons in die Parlement doen en hy vra my vir my
handtekening. Toe ek klaar is, vra hy dat hy nog ses handtekeninge wil hê!
Ek is verbaas en vra hoekom. Hy sê, “Man, miskien as ek gelukkig is, kan ek
ses Mulder-handtekeninge verruil vir een van Bryan Habana!” [Gelag.] Nou,
dit sê iets van waar ons nou trek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[I’m thinking of Percy Montgomery, who, I think, should be the player of
the tournament. When I saw how he was peppered by the high kicks of Johnny
Wilkinson, I thought of the words of the former Springbok, Basie Viviers,
who years ago said:


   Flyhalves who kick a lot, make fullbacks very famous.

I want to tell Bryan Habana, rugby player of the year, an adapted Vorster
story. [Applause.] A young man came rushing up to me at the airport and
asked me if I was Pieter Mulder, the leader of the FF Plus. He said he had
a lot of appreciation for what we are doing in Parliament and he asked for
my autograph. When I had signed he said that he wanted six more autographs!
I was surprised and asked why. He said, “Man, if I’m lucky, I will be able
to exchange six Mulder autographs for one Bryan Habana autograph!”
[Laughter.] Now, that says something about where we are currently.]

Sir, in this Assembly we mostly disagree with each other. At times we have
had serious disagreements with each other about rugby and the Springboks.
However, before the final match, the FF Plus submitted a motion here, and a
part of it reads thus:

   ... that this House conveys its support and best wishes to the Springboks
   and expresses the hope that the Springboks will be crowned the rugby
   world champions on Saturday.

Madam, unbelievably, no debate followed and I am happy to tell you that the
motion was accepted enthusiastically and unanimously. [Applause.]

Die oorwinning van die Springbokspan en die reaksie daarop wys vir my dat
gewone Suid-Afrikaners ver voor baie van ons as politici is. ‘n Merietespan
met Habana as held het waarskynlik meer vir goeie verhoudinge gedoen as al
die gepraat hierso. Die mense daar buite soek goedgesindheid, hulle soek
sukses en nie onnodige politiek nie.

Wat die toekoms van Suid-Afrika betref, wil ek vir die mense in die Huis
sê, as ons die regte besluite hier neem, kan ons die atmosfeer wat tans in
Suid-Afrika heers, vir altyd behou. Ek dank u en ek sê dankie vir die
Springbokke daar bo op die gallery. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The Springbok team’s victory and the reaction to it show me that ordinary
South Africans are far ahead of many of us politicians. A team selected on
merit with Habana as its hero has probably done more for good relations
than all the talking here. The people out there want goodwill, they want
success and not unnecessary politics.

Concerning the future of South Africa I want to say to the people in the
House that if we take the correct decisions here, we can retain the
atmosphere currently prevailing in South Africa forever. I thank you and I
thank the Springboks up there in the gallery.]

Ms M P MENTOR: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Of the 12 parties here
today - including my party, the ANC - eleven have fielded male speakers.
Patricia de Lille was the only female speaker. The supporters of rugby are
men and women. I wonder what message we are sending to the female
supporters who are here, especially my daughter who is sitting over there.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: That’s not a point of order, but it is a very serious point,
and I think this House, particularly the different political parties, must
ponder on it.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, we in the UCDP align
ourselves with the motion to congratulate the Springbok rugby team on their
magnificent performance and good sporting conduct, on and off the field. I
tried my best to “green” myself, and I did it in my own way, unlike the
other people.

That the Springboks, after the tournament, almost swept the boards
regarding awards, speaks volumes about them as sports ambassadors of this
country. In spite of the whingeing that can still be heard around, the
Springboks represented the nation well.

We know that human beings are fastidious most of the time. That is why even
in the present day there are those who still complain or who have
reservations about the progress this country has made in the economy. It is
not surprising that those doomsayers keep on saying it could have been done
better if it was done this way or that way. The Springboks shouldn’t tear
themselves apart over that. After all, Chihuahuas keep yelping at moving
vehicles!

We, in the UCDP, say that the team, their management and all involved have
done their nation proud. As sportsmen, they all deserve our respect,
recognition and support.

The Springbok team has shown how it is done; they have succeeded in
bringing all South Africans together as a nation. We should not allow this
unity to fall away in what we say or do, hereafter.
May the team grow from strength to strength and go to greater heights in
their green and gold.

Well done, Jake and “die manne” [the team.] Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr R B BHOOLA: Madam Speaker, I have mentioned previously that South Africa
is not just a sporting nation, but also a winning nation.

On Tuesday morning our victorious Bokke arrived at the OR Tambo
International Airport and were met by a huge number of supporters who have
evidently crossed the apartheid divide and supported the team irrespective
of the ill effects of that regime.

If anything, we congratulate and thank the Bokke for a fabulous win and for
bridging that divide. We have witnessed supporters throughout the country
reaching out in celebration. We are extremely proud of our people who have
found it in themselves to come together and unite at this auspicious
moment, with the Bokke having emerged victorious.

The MF has immense respect for the sport of rugby. We believe that the
support it has received throughout South Africa shows that it has the
potential to bring about transformation at the highest level.

May the sensational win be a further affirmation of our enduring faith in
the value of inculcating a culture of sport amongst our youth, so that one
more child participating in sport is one more kept out of court.

As a new democracy, we are striving to bridge many racial and gender
divides. Rugby, like soccer and cricket, can help us to do that. We cherish
the hope that this beautiful game of rugby will be developed and extended
to the rural and disadvantaged communities.

We applaud the rugby captain for his impeccable leadership. We also applaud
his astoundingly heroic team. Last but not least, we thank Jake White, the
South African rugby coach, who steered our team to success. Bokke, South
Africa salutes you! Keep up the good spirit!

This message comes from the hon Minister of Sport and Recreation in KwaZulu-
Natal, Mr Amichand Rajbansi. We wish you beautiful thoughts and wonderful,
great and overwhelming success for the future. Thank you.

Mr M T LIKOTSI: Madam Speaker, the APC wishes to pay tribute to the
Springbok rugby team for winning the International Rugby Board World Cup
2007. You have made us very proud and restored our fading dignity in this
sport, guys.

The APC wishes to thank our brilliant coach Jake White and his technical
staff for a job well done. We thank you guys who stood the test of time
and, to the captain John Smit, we thank you for steering this Springbok
ship through troubled waters in France. Tribute should also go to the SA
Rugby Board who, under difficult circumstances, soldiered on to where we
are today, the deserving champions.

The APC pays tribute to the nation for standing firm behind the Springboks
through hell and high water. Without you supporters, it could have been
difficult for the Springboks to withstand the pressure from its
competitors. Keep on supporting the team at all times, win, draw or lose.
We thank the President, the Deputy President and the Minister of Sport and
Recreation for boosting the team’s morale in France. You displayed your
leadership qualities when it was least expected. Well done!

Last, but not least, we thank your spouses, partners and families for
allowing you to represent the country in a tough competition. We know it
was hard to see your loved ones being battered mercilessly on the playing
field in France. Your support is greatly appreciated. We thank you.
[Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, the FD thanks you for calling this special
assembly to honour the Springboks at Parliament today.

Bringing home the Web Ellis Trophy is, first of all, a victory for sport
and South Africa, combining discipline, focus, talent, management skill and
opportunity to produce a winning team. The formula for success is found in
doing the basics right and to follow through with endurance, perseverance
and a belief in oneself, the team and a sound set of noble virtues and
values.

The victorious Springbok team has shown that they possess these qualities
to be crowned worthy champions of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The victorious
Springboks also lifted the Web Ellis trophy as a symbol representing a
nation that believes in itself.

The 2007 Rugby World Cup victory captured the imagination of a nation,
reminding us of our collective success in changing a hostile political
system into an open democratic system through peaceful means. The victory
took us back to the historic elections in 1994, with Madiba personifying
the first truly great democratic President of this land. We were also
reminded of how the new South Africa inspired the Springboks’ first Rugby
World Cup win in 1995, which was followed by Bafana Bafana winning the
Africa Cup of Nations in 1996.

The Springboks also won the highest accolades at the World Cup. Well done,
John Smit, for being voted the best captain. Well done, Bryan Habana, with
your eight tries, for being voted the best player, and well done, Jake
White, for being voted the best coach at this tournament. [Applause.]

We congratulate the Springboks on having won the Rugby World Cup. Go on and
use your experience to mentor others. Well done, Springboks! Well done!
Amandla! [Applause.]

Mnr S SIMMONS: Speaker, ek kon gister nie help om ’n knop in my keel te kry
toe ek die toejuiging van Kapenaars van alle rasse meegemaak het in die
middestad nie.

Ek wil aan die Bokke en hul afrigtingspan sê julle het meer vir nasiebou
gedoen as menige politici. Ek wil dus die agb Hoofsweep van die ANC se
resolusie beaam waar hy erkenning gee aan die Bokspan se bydrae tot
nasiebou. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S SIMMONS: Madam Speaker, yesterday I couldn’t help but get a lump in
my throat when I experienced the acclamation of Capetonians of all races in
the city centre.

I would like to say to the Bokke and their coaching team that they have
done more for nation-building than most politicians. I would, therefore,
like to associate myself with the ANC Chief Whip’s resolution in which he
acknowledges the Bok team’s contribution to nation-building.]

Madam Speaker, many commentators have correctly pointed out that the World
Cup victory gave nation-building in South Africa massive momentum. This
momentum is being seriously threatened by constant ill-considered
statements regarding transformation by the Chairperson and Deputy
Chairperson of the portfolio committee on sport. If we are able to
capitalise on this momentum, the Whippery of the ANC should give serious
consideration to replacing the hon Khompela and hon Frolick as Chairperson
and Deputy Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation.
[Interjections.] There are more than enough members within the ANC with
much more appropriate credentials and, therefore, with a better insight
into rugby and sports in general than these gentlemen.

Mr T M MASUTHA: On a point of order: Is it parliamentary for the hon member
to cast aspersions on a fellow member without going the way of a
substantive motion?

The SPEAKER: Hon member, there is nothing unparliamentary in what the
member has said so far. Please finish up, hon member.

Mr S SIMMONS: Thank you, Madam Chair.

To Mr Hoskins and his council: Please ensure a nonracial rugby fraternity,
one that is neither white nor black, but one that provides all the
opportunities to share in the joy and pleasure of the game. Consider your
colleague and Bok team manager Mr Yeye’s recent statement that our national
team should not be customised for any specific race group, but that it
should always reflect the best talents South Africa has to offer.
[Applause.]

The NA rejects representivity as a racial concept. I thank you. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I would first of all
like to acknowledge and call upon these people whose names I am going to
read out to stand up so that this House will see them, since this is an
auspicious moment.

I call upon Mr Oregan Hoskins, who is the President of SA Rugby.
[Applause.] The second one is Mr Zola Yeye, who is the manager. [Applause.]
I also call on Jake White, the coach, to stand up. [Applause.] I know there
are many I could have called but I am just going to call the last two, who
are Percy Montgomery ... [Applause] ... and I am also going to call Bryan
Habana. [Applause.]

This is a memorable moment in the history of our country. Our people are
united in rejoicing at the victory of the Springbok team. Whilst we
celebrate the Springbok victory, I just want to give a little history so
that these great guys, the sporting team, and everybody in South Africa
should know where we come from. [Interjections.]

I want to say, as we go on, we must build such that any victory becomes the
victory of the people with their hearts and minds.

The SPEAKER: Order! Can I stop that activity over in that corner? Please
proceed, hon Chief Whip.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: When we get this type of moment of
victory, it must be a true victory from our hearts, souls, cities,
townships and rural areas. In this we shall be saying all of you are
welcome to become Springboks. We are saying to you who have won today that
tomorrow you will be coaches of the future, but don’t forget other people.
If we don’t do that, we will have serious problems like we had in the past.


In boxing, we had two champions, a black and a white champion. We had Vicky
Toweel who was a white bantamweight champion, and we had Slumber Gogotya a
black bantamweight champion in the past. Vicky Toweel went on to win the
world championship. David Gogotya was not allowed to fight then. One day it
was arranged that these two champions would do some sparring in a corner in
a gym. Funnily enough, they sparred and Gogotya dropped the world champion.
There was silence and the government said that this fact must not be
published.

We also had Jacob Ntuli, who left South Africa, who was a good flyweight
champion. He left South Africa because he could not see his way forward. He
went to Britain and won the British Empire Championship. That man could not
come back to South Africa to fight in our midst. He was kept in England
because apartheid could not accommodate him.

Let us take the case of tennis. Tennis is dead in South Africa nowadays. We
no longer speak of Ferreira and others. It is dead and it can only survive
if all our people, all of us, are prepared to develop everybody in South
Africa in our sporting activities. [Applause.]

This is to the Springboks: This is not a political speech, but to make you
think, so that you are better sportsmen of tomorrow and tell the true
history and you can say not that way, but this way.

Whilst we celebrate we must also not forget that, last week, Bafana Bafana
won the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations Cup, too.
[Applause.] To the Springboks, we say: Halala halala [well done], to you.
We also say carry this with pride, but remembering that South Africa needs
you not only as a particular Springbok, but as all the Springboks in South
Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: That concludes the debate and I take it that there are no
objections to the motion and it is, therefore, agreed to. I will now
suspend the proceedings until 14:00 when the Minister of Finance will
deliver the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement.
Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to.

Business suspended at 12:45 and resumed at 14:07.

                     MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL
                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, hon members, our dear friends in
the House and at home, in tabling the 2007 Medium-Term Budget Policy
Statement, we can affirm that economic growth and investment in public
services are steadily bringing a better life to millions of our people.

We can look back with pride on the course we chose in implementing our
Reconstruction and Development Programme, because we can see the fruit of
the new constitutional order we built; of the transformation of policy and
service delivery we undertook; of the tough decisions we made and the
dedicated efforts of South Africans from all walks of life who have
contributed to our social progress and economic renewal. Today is better
than yesterday, and tomorrow will be even better than today. [Applause.]

We can  assert  this  confidently  because  our  progress  is  recorded  and
measured, and the facts speak louder than  any  rhetorical  flourishes.  Yet
the message of today’s Budget Statement is not  that  we  have  reached  our
destination or that victory can already be  claimed;  it  is  that  we  have
advanced to new challenges and another phase in our  transformation  journey
still lies ahead.

The 2007 Community Survey released by Statistics SA last week tells a  story
of steady progress in public service delivery. In 1996 just  over  half  our
people did not have water in their homes. Today,  over  88%  of  our  people
have access to piped water. In 1996, only 64% of our people lived in  formal
houses. Today, over 70% enjoy this right.

In almost every area of public service delivery, from access to schooling
and health care to refuse removal; from electrification to access to
computers; from roads and streetlights to sports facilities; from
telecommunication services to public transport, we can point to steady
progress in living standards. Development is also about access to jobs.
It’s about security of income and redressing past inequalities. We can show
measured quantitative progress on these fronts, although we clearly still
have more work to do in these dimensions of reconstruction and development.

So, in tabling  the  2007  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement,  we  also
reaffirm  our  commitment  to  building  a  stronger  economy,  faster   job
creation, broadening participation and deepening the quality of  social  and
economic opportunities for all. South Africa is now entering  its  9th  year
of the longest economic  upswing  since  the  national  accounts  have  been
recorded in this country.

National income has risen by 22%  per  person  since  1999,  with  increases
across all income groups. Employment is rising  faster  than  at  any  point
since the 1960s. Fixed investment has increased sharply since 2002, by  over
10% a year. These are, indeed, substantial  steps  towards  our  medium-term
economic goals - growth of 6% a year or more, an unemployment rate of  below
14% by 2014 and an aggregate poverty rate half that recorded  in  2004.  Our
commitment is not just an aspiration towards these  targets.  We  intend  to
measure progress, step by step, in sharing  the  democratic  dividend  among
all of our people.

We need to understand that the present buoyancy in our  economic  growth  is
partly  a  consequence  of  favourable  global  economic  conditions.   High
commodity prices, low interest rates and strong  international  demand  have
contributed  to  the  momentum  of  our  income  growth  and  to   financing
investment through capital inflows.

We need to welcome  and  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities  of  global
growth, but we then also  need  to  distinguish  temporary  prosperity  from
structural progress. We need  to  ensure  that  windfall  gains  are  wisely
invested and surplus resources are set aside for when markets  turn  against
us in times ahead.
On the  domestic  front,  our  economy  remains  strong,  buoyed  by  rising
investment in productive capacity, higher  employment  and  incomes,  strong
consumer  demand  and  healthy  foreign   capital   inflows.   Last   week’s
announcement of a R37 billion investment by the  Industrial  and  Commercial
Bank of China in one of  our  leading  banks  indicates  that  international
confidence in our economy is high, and perhaps also signals a new place  for
Africa in the changing patterns of trade  and  finance  flows  in  the  21st
century.

So the healthy economic outlook that we  are  able  to  table  today  is  of
interest not just to our own people, but also in our region  and  the  wider
world. We expect the South African economy to grow by  4,9%  this  year  and
4,5% in 2008, before returning to about 5% in the year 2009  and  2010.  The
outlook is somewhat less positive than it appeared in February.

Financial crises in developed markets, global imbalances, high food and  oil
prices internationally and slowing growth in the  USA  and  other  developed
countries do cloud the sky. The advent of the sub-prime mortgage  crisis  in
the US is further evidence of the interconnectedness of our world, and  also
a reminder of the fact that we must build  up  our  cushion  against  global
volatility.

Our approach to international finance and monetary management has  meant  an
accumulation of over US$30  billion  in  foreign  reserves  with  the  South
African Reserve Bank, which in itself is a considerable strength and also  a
contribution to greater exchange rate and interest rate  stability.  In  the
fiscal stance outlined today  we  indicate  how  public  finances  are  also
contributing to the resilience  of  the  economy  in  the  context  of  both
international uncertainty and the future investment requirements of our  own
economy.

In regard to inflation and capacity utilisation we  are  mindful  that  more
rapid economic progress has itself brought new dimensions to  the  struggle.
In the context of increasing oil and food prices globally,  and  I  want  to
emphasise that these are global price increases, rising  inflation  has  re-
emerged as a policy concern.

Our expanding investment spending has run  well  ahead  of  our  ability  to
save, contributing to an increased current account deficit  on  the  balance
of payments. This highlights the importance  of  improved  productivity  and
industrial competitiveness  as  a  condition  for  further  acceleration  in
growth and employment creation over the decade ahead.

The recent increase in CPIX inflation to  6,7%  has  necessitated  steps  to
curb inflation and the Reserve Bank, on the recommendations of the  monetary
policy committee, has implemented those steps.

Global price trends present an inflation  challenge  for  all  economies  at
this time. Food and  commodity  prices  have  increased  sharply  in  recent
years. More recently, the  depreciation  of  the  US  dollar  and  continued
market pressures have increased oil prices to  over  US$90  per  barrel,  an
increase of 23% in just the last two months.

We must pause and consider the impact of  that  on  an  economy  like  ours,
where so many of our people live far from where  they  work  and  where  the
bulk of South Africans are dependent on hydrocarbon fuels to get  around.  A
23% increase in the global price clearly has a  very  profound  impact.  The
global  trends  have  interacted  with  our  own  rapid   economic   growth,
agricultural  supply  conditions,  broader  supply  pressures   and   skills
deficits to push the CPIX above the inflation target this year.

The rate of capacity utilisation in the economy is very  high  and  in  some
sectors  demand  pressures  are  generating  higher  prices.   These   price
pressures will not abate quickly,  yet  addressing  them  and  returning  to
within the inflation target range is important  for  our  long-term  growth.
Higher inflation reduces our competitiveness, undermines the real income  of
rich and poor households alike  and  creates  greater  uncertainty  for  the
investment decisions of firms.

The task of bringing down inflation cannot  just  be  left  to  the  Reserve
Bank. Robust investment in capacity is underway and this  will  reduce  some
of the price pressures over time. All actors in the economy have a  role  to
play. In particular, an improvement in  the  fiscal  balance  will  help  to
moderate inflation and create space for  stronger  private  sector  economic
activity.
Because we are so determined to make tomorrow better  than  today,  we  must
carefully analyse our present pattern of growth.  For  the  next  two  years
somewhat slower growth in  household  spending  will  be  offset  by  rising
private and  public  investment.  Our  increased  investment  has  not  been
matched by a commensurate increase in domestic  production  or  in  savings.
Rising inflation and a high  current  account  deficit  are  both  signs  of
robust economic growth and that we  run  the  risk  of  not  being  able  to
finance that growth in the future.

In order to address these imbalances, we need to sharpen  our  microeconomic
policy instruments through lowering the costs of  doing  business,  stepping
up our efforts in skills development, increasing trade  competitiveness  and
investing in infrastructure that will support our economic expansion.

To grow rapidly and to sustain that growth, we  must  increase  exports  for
they are the source over time of the revenue that must pay for our  imports.
The prices of gold, platinum and other commodities  have  risen  sharply  in
recent years and this has helped us, but we need to take  further  and  more
aggressive steps to diversify our trade capacity.

Because of its impact on productivity and innovation,  trade  policy  has  a
central place in promoting competitiveness. Our  approach  needs  to  ensure
that competition is fostered through tariff simplification  and  reform  and
that  incentives  for  investment  and  for  research  and  development  are
appropriately targeted and effectively administered.

Public accountability is critical to the success of such initiatives, so  we
will seek to publish appropriate reviews and assessments  of  our  progress.
In addition, both industrial  and  labour  market  policies  must  focus  on
raising the labour intensity of the economy so that we can  create  jobs  at
an even faster pace. Greater progress in channelling young people into  jobs
has to be central to the policy objectives over the coming years. In all  of
these matters, we face intense international competition.

A recent survey of 600 chief executives of multinational  companies  said  a
shortage of qualified staff  ranked  as  their  biggest  concern.  No,  this
survey was not conducted in South Africa.  The  skills  shortage  complained
about is in Asia. Yes, a region with almost half the world’s  population  is
experiencing severe skills constraints.

China is battling with severe shortages  of  lawyers  –  Gerda,  there’s  an
opportunity. Major Indian companies are complaining about a shortage  of  IT
professionals contrary to common wisdom about the IT epicentre of the  world
being in India. Everywhere companies are experiencing difficulty in  finding
industrial, commercial and managerial expertise.

Last week, the European Union announced its intention to recruit  20 million
skilled foreigners over the next two decades. I believe that  this  kind  of
parasitic conduct of nations is wrong. [Applause.]  The  point  we  need  to
debate about South Africa’s skills shortages is not whether  they  exist  or
not, but how we should confront the challenge and deal with it,  recognising
that everywhere else in the world they are focused on the same thing.

We will continue to place education and skills development  at  the  top  of
our budget priority list.  Building  a  learning  society  is  partly  about
improving the quality and content of what goes on in the classroom,  but  it
is  also  about  investment  by  businesses  and  their   employees,   about
communities taking ownership and responsibility for their schools and  about
how families communicate values and capabilities to their children.

I am aware that the negotiations with educator  unions  on  the  occupation-
specific dispensation have encountered some difficulties. We all  know  that
a better career progression system is needed to retain good teachers and  so
efforts to unblock these difficulties must enjoy our full support.  I  think
it is appropriate in this  context  that  this  House  pledges  support  for
Minister Pandor in this endeavour.

The area of skills development is clearly one in which  we  will  make  more
progress if we address the institutional and financial barriers  that  stand
in the way of aligning resources with needs.

I share  with  the  Minister  of  Labour  a  disappointment  that  financial
management has been poor in several of our  sector  education  and  training
authorities. At the end of last year, our Setas held  over  R3,7 billion  in
cash reserves – effectively levy income that employers had not  utilised  to
reimburse training expenses or skills development projects that had not  yet
been implemented.

Other parts of our higher and further education system  that  are  ready  to
expand enrolment and step up their contribution to human investment  do  not
have the financial resources to do so. This surely cannot  be  correct,  and
so we  have  to  explore  options  for  improving  the  integration  of  our
education and training financing arrangements and we must do this together.

For the past five years, public spending has increased by an annual average
of 9,4% in real terms. That is 9,4% above inflation. If a comparison is
made with expenditure in 1995, it shows that public spending has doubled in
real terms since then. Higher spending has been financed by falling debt
service costs and rising tax revenues.

We must take into account that some of the growth in our revenue is
cyclical, related to high commodity prices and the consumption boom. It is
incumbent upon us to manage these cyclical revenues differently.

In this Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, we introduce the concept  of  a
structural budget balance. This scares Minister  Thoko  Didiza,  who  thinks
that the word ``structure’’ does not belong there. So, sometimes it is  also
referred to as a cyclically adjusted budget balance.

The structural balance attempts to calculate the effect of cyclical
revenues on our budget balance. It is not about structural adjustment, if
that is what you want us to say and agree to. This addition to our box of
tools allows us to ensure that public spending is protected, even if
conditions worsen.

Revenue that is cyclical must be treated differently. To do otherwise, we
admit, would be reckless. Some of the cyclical revenue should be spent on
things that raise our ability to grow faster in the long term - things such
as infrastructure, education and institutional capacity. It also makes
sense to use some of that cyclical revenue to pay off debt or to save for
future needs.

With this in mind, government is proposing to budget for a surplus of  about
0,6% of the GDP for the next three years, so that when  economic  conditions
deteriorate we have the resources to  cushion  the  economy.  When  cyclical
revenues are removed from our calculations, the  structural  budget  balance
indicates a deficit that will rise to about 1% of  the  GDP  in  the  fiscal
year ending on 31 March 2011.

The tax burden on the economy has  risen  since  2004,  mainly  due  to  the
cyclical windfalls accrued as a result of higher consumption  and  commodity
prices. Rising employment and higher salary increases have  also  led  to  a
rise in tax revenue. This year, we project  to  collect  about  R8,5 billion
more than what we budgeted in February, mainly due to higher  inflation  and
related salary increases.

I just want to remind this House that  in  previous  years  we  have  always
collected substantially more. This year we are in the R8,5 billion zone.  We
expect that over the medium term, main budget revenue will  be  about  27,5%
of GDP.

We reaffirm the principle that cyclical  revenues  should  not  be  used  to
provide permanent tax relief. However, proceeds from  better  administration
and tax compliance and the broadening of the tax base may be used  to  lower
the tax burden, as we have done in the past.

Apart from the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement we are also going to
table an Adjustments Appropriation Bill today. We have tabled two
adjustments appropriations this year. The special adjustments budget tabled
in September 2007 dealt with urgent transfers for the following items: The
sum of R1,9 billion brought forward from 2008-09 to finance the
construction of stadiums for 2010; R2,5 billion for the pebble bed modular
reactor project; R700 million for the Land Bank; R222 million for Denel;
R45 million for Alexkor; R500 million to Sentech for wireless broadband
infrastructure.

In the Adjustments Appropriation Bill that we table today, we include
details of amounts rolled over from last year’s budget as well as
unforeseen and unavoidable expenditure. These include an amount of R654
million for expenditure resulting from fires, floods and other adverse
weather conditions – I think we all recall what happened to grazing land
and forests a few months ago - R400 million for the prevention and
treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis; R744 million to support the
restructuring of SAA; R1,9 billion to accommodate the higher-than-budgeted
costs of the 2007 salary agreement.

Taking into account about R5 billion in underspending, total spending
amounts to R542 billion - about 15,4% more than expenditure in the past
fiscal year. The revised estimate for the budget surplus is R10,8 billion,
which is marginally higher than the R10,7 billion projected in February.

The proposed budget framework for the next three years makes provision for
about R81 billion of additional allocations, allowing for spending on
services to rise by 6,4% a year in real terms over the next three years. Of
this amount, about R15 billion goes towards funding the higher cost of the
2007 Public Service salary agreement. A further R2 billion goes towards the
occupation-specific dispensations proposed for educators and the envisaged
dispensation for social workers. In 2006, the budget provided R4,6 billion
for occupation-specific adjustments in the health sector.

About R4,3 billion  over  the  MTEF  period  will  go  towards  compensating
pension and social grant beneficiaries for  rising  food  prices  and  other
cost-of-living increases, so that  we  can  maintain  the  value  of  social
grants.

Of the remaining amounts, municipalities receive about R12,6 billion to
accelerate the pace of delivery of water, sanitation and electricity
connections. These resources also cover the additional costs of providing
poor households with free basic services. Over the next three years,
infrastructure transfers to municipalities total R57 billion, reflecting a
firm commitment to sharing the fruits of economic development. This
includes a further R2 billion for public transport infrastructure and
systems.

Provinces receive about R36 billion, mainly for targeted interventions to
improve the quality of schooling, health care and welfare services. The
proposed budget framework provides for growth in the provincial equitable
share of 11,9% a year over the next three years. The new estimates of
provincial population numbers are taken into account in the allocation of
these funds.

Several  conditional  grant  allocations  are  revised  upwards.  A  further
R2,1 billion goes towards funding the comprehensive HIV and Aids  programme.
Early  learning  opportunities  and  the  expansion  of  Grade  R  are  also
prioritised, because these are programmes that  improve  outcomes  in  later
years.  Provision  will  be  made  for  more  places   for   learners   with
disabilities, who therefore have particular needs, in our schooling  system.
The School Nutrition Programme receives a further addition  to  take  higher
food prices into account and to feed  more  children  for  the  full  school
year.

Earlier this year, the Minister of Education released a report detailing
the state of school facilities. It illustrates considerable progress over
the past decade, but also signals that more needs to be done. Whereas in
1996, 51% of schools were overcrowded, this figure has now dropped to 24%.
The number of schools without electricity has decreased from nearly 14 000
to 4 300. [Applause.] Schools without adequate water have declined from
8 800 to 3 150. The number of schools with access to computers has
increased significantly, but there are still 17 000 without them.

With these challenges in  mind,  a  further  R2,7 billion  is  proposed  for
school building and maintenance over the MTEF period.  [Applause.]  National
departments  receive  about   R33 billion   of   the   proposed   additional
expenditure. Much of this will go to economic infrastructure  and  services,
including  a  substantial  rise  in  funding  for   industrial   development
incentives.
We  will  also  increase  spending  on  fighting  crime,  improving  service
delivery in the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  and  expanding  labour-based
employment  programmes.  Higher  education  will  benefit  from   additional
allocations in recognition of rising student numbers and the need  to  boost
financial assistance to students.

The 2008 budget framework favours programmes that induce efficiency  savings
in other areas of spending - for example, removing  nonroadworthy  vehicles,
reducing road accidents and taking pressure off our emergency  services  and
trauma  health  care  services.  Increasing  the  number   of   agricultural
extension  workers  enhances  the  prospects  of  successful   land   reform
projects.

Allocating resources to the right areas is only half the  battle.  The  2008
budget framework raises the bar in the quest to improve value for money.  In
line  with  the  Presidency’s  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Framework,   the
Treasury has issued guidelines for the development of  performance  measures
related to each programme. The intention is to  assist  Parliament  and  the
public to hold departments to account  for  the  delivery  of  key  outputs.
Therefore, let us look beyond how much there is to what that money buys.

As part of finalising the 2008 MTEF, national departments are asked to make
R2,3 billion worth of savings as part of an efficiency programme. National
departments are asked to improve their management of expenditure on travel,
entertainment, marketing, catering, events and consultants. [Applause.] It
is anticipated that provincial treasuries will adopt a similar approach in
the finalisation of their budgets. These savings will be reprioritised
towards frontline services.

Madam Speaker, I pause for applause at this stage.  [Applause].  Thank  you,
it is welcomed; it was so spontaneous, it is really beautiful!

This Budget Framework and the related economic policy  proposals  provide  a
clear platform for investment in the infrastructure and  services  that  are
likely to raise our  growth  path  towards  6%.  About  R20 billion  of  the
additional amounts go towards capital formation, signalling  a  continuation
of the drive towards broadening access  to  basic  services  and  increasing
economic efficiency.

Allocations  for  targeted  salary  increases  are  related  to  performance
systems presently being implemented in  the  Public  Service.  For  fear  of
being very unpopular, let me say that this excludes Members of Parliament.

On  the  basis  of  sound  fiscal  and  economic  policies,  we  have   made
significant  progress  in  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  all  South
Africans, particularly those living in poverty. With the right  policies  in
place and through steady improvements in  building  implementation  capacity
and monitoring service delivery, we can accelerate progress in  transforming
the lives of all South Africans.
Madam Speaker, ten years ago this month, the South African Revenue Service
Act was promulgated to give effect to a key element of our public finance
reforms – the creation of an administratively independent, efficient and
effective revenue and customs authority that would be able to fund our
spending objectives in a sustainable way. Since those chaotic days, the
Revenue Service has evolved into an organisation respected and admired
across the world. [Applause.]

The SA Revenue Service has been at the centre of a series of tax
administrative and organisational reforms that have completely changed our
relationship with taxpayers. A key element of the social contract between
government and citizens is that paying one’s fair share of taxes is
essential to all of our futures and that revenue collection is as much
about a better service to the public as it is about enforcement.

It is this virtuous circle which lies at the heart of our fiscal policy and
at the centre of Sars’ unyielding drive to promote compliance by providing
ever higher service levels, greater simplicity and ease of access to honest
taxpayers.

Madam Speaker, none  of  us  needs  reminding  of  the  unrelenting  vigour,
dedication and passion of Commissioner Pravin Gordhan  and  the  15 000  men
and women who work for the SA Revenue  Service.  [Applause.]  Today,  as  we
congratulate the management and staff of Sars for  ten  years  of  dedicated
service, we must also  thank  South  African  taxpayers  –  individuals  and
companies –  for  their  contributions  to  our  nation’s  development.  The
Commissioner has asked me to mention that tomorrow is the deadline  for  tax
returns. [Laughter.]

Madam Speaker, we are close to the highpoint of our year as the host of  the
G20. In just three weeks, we host the Finance  Ministers  and  Central  Bank
Governors from the  19  systemically  most  significant  economies  and  the
European Union as the 20th party just outside of  Cape  Town.  This  meeting
follows a series of consultations dealing with fiscal space, the  impact  of
commodity prices  and  reform  to  the  World  Bank  and  the  International
Monetary Fund. We have also used  our  chairmanship  of  the  G20  to  bring
African finance ministries into a dialogue with more developed countries  on
issues of development.

I would like to thank colleagues in Cabinet, and in  particular  members  of
the Ministers’ Committee on the Budget, for  their  role  in  crafting  this
policy statement. I would also like  to  say  thank  you  to  the  staff  of
Statistics South Africa, the Ministry of Finance and the National Treasury.

Madam Speaker, I hereby table the 2007-08  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill,
the Adjusted Estimates of National Revenue, 2007 and the Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement for consideration by Parliament.

I thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement will be referred to
the Joint Budget Committee and the Portfolio Committee on Finance for
consideration in accordance with their respective mandates. The Adjustment
Appropriation Bill, together with related papers, will be referred to the
Portfolio Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                        SECURITIES TRANSFER TAX BILL
                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to
introduce the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill and the Securities Transfer Tax
Bill for this year. These Bills contain the second instalment of tax
announcements contained in the annual February 2007 Budget address to the
nation.

Given the complex nature of the South African economy, these Bills cover an
expansive range of tax topics. However, despite these disparate topics,
government’s goals for the tax system remain clear and consistent – to
achieve equity, certainty, efficiency and simplicity. These all call for a
broadening of the tax base and, where possible, a reduction in the
complexity of the tax code.

However, it must be stressed that unintended loopholes exploited by some
taxpayers and their highly sophisticated advisers will not be tolerated.
The additional revenue stemming from closing these loopholes will provide
scope for further tax reforms or funds available for critical expenditure
priorities and lower tax rates where deemed appropriate.

In terms of business taxation the main focus of the Bills is the Secondary
Tax on Companies - STC. The STC rate will be reduced from 12,5% to 10%. The
rate reduction comes with the closing of significant loopholes that have
emerged in the market place. A small group of taxpayers have sought to
disguise otherwise taxable sales and taxable dividends through a variety of
means.

Many of these schemes seek to artificially classify both sets of
transactions as a tax-free return of capital or a set tax-free intra group
dividends. While many of these schemes are remote to all but a very elite
set of tax experts, the costs of these schemes should not be ignored.

We understand that some private equity fund managers are very active in
this regard and there is an international outcry, because in the UK they
found that private equity fund managers pay less tax than domestic workers,
for instance.

This drive to close loopholes should, however, not be perceived as an anti-
business attitude on the part of government. The set of Bills presented
today contain a range of measures designed to support the growth of
business. Shares held by taxpayers for at least three years will now
automatically receive beneficial capital gains tax rates.

For individuals with savings held directly in the form of shares, this
change will mean that there will be certainty that the tax from growth from
these shares will be limited to a 10% capital gains rate. Other provisions
in the Bills presented today seek to minimise the tax impact of mergers and
acquisitions, many of which are important for our country’s goal of
transformation.

Finally, in order to encourage infrastructure development, the Bills
contain depreciation tax relief for new and used rolling stock, railways
port infrastructure, environmental equipment and commercial buildings.

There are also a few special situations. As strange as it may seem to some
our tax system does have a sympathetic heart. Beyond the broad-based relief
in income tax rates granted earlier this year, certain situations call for
special assistance. Of particular note is the taxation of sporting bodies.

Our national and provincial sports organisations contain both professional
and amateur sports divisions. Our children in amateur sports today need
support so that they can become our future stars in rugby, soccer and
cricket, or at least so that they can enjoy themselves along the way.
Under the proposed amendments, professional sports organisations can now
obtain tax deductions for funding amateur sports development directly.
[Applause.] Since most funding for amateur sports today is derived this
way, the deduction should play a very significant role.

On a different note, certain workers face the risk of physical injury or
even death in their jobs. In order to compensate them for this danger of
doing such work, government presently provides tax-free compensation in
terms of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act of
1993. However, some employers provide additional death and injury benefits
that are currently subject to tax.

The proposed amendments allow for tax-free treatment for up to R300 000 for
these additional benefits. Our policemen and women who face a daily risk in
protecting our society will be major beneficiaries in these proposals as
well. [Applause.]

Lastly, many of our poorer citizens lack ready access to banking
facilities, especially in the rural areas. Earlier this year, the National
Treasury introduced the Co-operative Banks Bill so that communities can
form their own associations for everyday savings and loans.

We are proposing an amendment that complements this effort by providing
small business tax relief for co-operative banks. This relief spares these
co-operative banks from a flat 29% tax charge. Co-operative banks will now
be eligible for tax exemption for up to R43 000 of their annual net income,
a 10% charge for income up to R300 000 and 29% only thereafter. [Applause.]

The second set of Bills deals with securities transfer taxes on shares. It
is important to note that Securities Transfers Tax Bills do not represent
the new tax. These Bills merely combine pre-existing stamp duties on
unlisted shares and pre-existing uncertificated security taxes on listed
shares. The new regime simplifies many archaic rules and streamlines
exemptions. Most taxpayers should benefit from the reduction in compliance
costs associated with these changes.

Once again, Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chairperson of the
Portfolio Committee on Finance, the hon Nhlanhla Nene, for his leadership
and the members of the portfolio committee for their constructive role in
the process.

I would like to say the process because whilst there is a belief that
Parliament does not amend money Bills as any member of the Portfolio
Committee on Finance would be able to testify, hon Cronin, they have been
through this, they have heard hearings, they have submitted to us the
amendments that are necessary and these changes in the Bills before this
House reflect the views and wisdom of the Portfolio Committee on Finance.
[Applause.]
So, Madam Speaker, I hereby table the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill, 2007,
and the Securities Transfer Tax Bill 2007. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Bills referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance for consideration and
report.

                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Dr J T DELPORT: Deputy Speaker, I wish to give notice that I shall move:

   That Parliament debates the ethical standards of conduct that judicial
   officers ought to adhere to and the role of the Judicial Services
   Commission in this regard.

                  CONGRATULATIONS TO NATIONAL CRICKET TEAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Deputy Speaker, I move without
notice:

   That the House -

      1) notes the excellent performance by our national cricket team, the
         Proteas, in Pakistan on Monday, 29 October 2007;


      2) acknowledges that the magnificent performance of the cricket team
         in the tournament demonstrates the hard work by the team and
         management; and


      3) congratulates the Proteas on winning the test series and the one
         day tournament in Pakistan.


   Agreed to.

                      CONGRATULATIONS TO BAFANA BAFANA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I move without notice:

   That the House –

      1) congratulates Bafana Bafana on their 4-3 victory over Zambia to win
         the COSAFA Castle Cup in Bloemfontein on Wednesday, 24 October
         2007;


      2) notes that this win denied defending champions Zambia winning the
         Cup a record fourth time;


      3) recognises that this was only the second success in 10 years for
         South Africa in this annual Southern African Championship;


      4)  further recognises that this win means that the trophy will remain
         in South African hands, as this final was the last match to have
         been played in the history of the COSAFA Castle Cup; and


      5) congratulates the team and coach Carlos Parreira on this win and
         the boost it has given to footballers across the country.


Agreed to.

                               CORRECTION WEEK

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs L S CHIKUNGA (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, Deputy President, Members of
the Executive and hon members, we welcome the progress made by the
Department of Correctional Services during Correction Week from 15-19
October 2007.

It is one of the main highlights on the Department of Correctional
Services’ calendar and aims to create awareness around the various
correctional programmes driven by the department and its partners to break
the cycle of crime. The focus week of Correctional Services seeks to
inculcate knowledge and understanding of the department’s core mandate of
safe custody, rehabilitation and social reintegration of offenders, whilst
also encouraging meaningful public participation and involvement in the
implementation of the mandate.

Some members from this House attended the week’s activities and as such
were exposed to the celebration of best practices, model partnerships and
successes in ensuring safe custody, the progress made in rolling out the
implementation of the White Paper in centres of excellence and pockets of
best practices in social reintegration programmes. We acknowledge the
strides made by the Department of Correctional Services under the
stewardship of Minister Balfour.

Most of us are still talking about Correction Week and as the ANC we urge
all hon members to participate in turning around the many challenges facing
the country’s correctional system and make their mark in building a safer,
more secure and prosperous South Africa, where all can enjoy a better
quality of life. I thank you. [Applause.]

        AGENDA TO TOPPLE DA-LED MULTIPARTY GOVERNMENT IN WESTERN CAPE
                            (Member’s Statement)

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, the ANC is
currently engaged in its tenth attempt to topple the democratically elected
multiparty government in the Western Cape. They have, obviously, not learnt
that in a democracy, you must accept the will of the voters. It is an
outrage for the Western Cape Premier, Ebrahim Rasool, and the Western Cape
Provincial Police Commissioner, Mzwandile Petros, to be abusing resources
of state to pursue their party-political agenda against the DA-led
multiparty government.

Commissioner Petros has shown his political bias by continuously allowing
evidence that is part of a police investigation to be selectively leaked to
the media. It also seems that he reports on almost a daily basis to Premier
Rasool on the status of investigations into the Premier’s political
opponents, which is a clear conflict of interest and undermines the
constitutional requirements of a politically neutral police service.

The real outrage lies in this: Why have Commissioner Petros, Premier Rasool
and Safety and Security Minister Nqakula not taken any action against Badih
Chaaban, the councillor accused of making death threats, offering bribes
and having links to the criminal underworld? The ANC will, clearly, go all
out to protect this man ... [Time expired.]

                     NEGOTIATIONS ON TEACHERS’ SALARIES

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr A M MPONTSHANE (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, the IFP has noted with some
concern that the negotiation process on teachers’ salaries seems to have
hit new difficulties, with at least three major unions rejecting
government’s occupation-specific dispensation document. Naptosa, the
National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of SA, called the document
“unworkable” and has called for negotiations to be placed on hold, while
Sadtu, the SA Democratic Teachers’ Union, called it “a sham”.

It does appear strange that it would allegedly, take a new teacher about 57
years to be eligible for the maximum proposed salary. Surely, if this is
true, this proposal must be deemed unworkable and unrealistic.

The IFP recalls with concern the negative effects on learners of the recent
Public Service strike. It is clear that if common ground cannot be found
between teachers and the department, the potential for further disruption
in the education sector cannot be discounted.

It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the unions and the
department go back to the drawing board to come up with a solution that
will benefit both, by improving the salaries of teachers whilst improving
their performance. I thank you.

            BUILDING OF PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE AT DE DOORNS APPLAUDED

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnu M M DIKGACWI(ANC): Sekela-Somlomo, siqwalasela ngemigcobo nochulumanco
olungazenzisiyo ibhulorho esandula ukwakhiwa eDe Doorns. Ngenxa yeentsokolo
zezopolitiko wawungekho umhlaba owawubekelwe bucala kulungiselelwa
ukwakhiwa kwezakhiwo ezinje ngale bhulorho.

Sikwaqaphela nokuba imali engangezigidi ezinga-20 eerandi esetyenzisiweyo
ukwakha le bhulorho yenze ukuba kuvuleke amathuba engqesho kuninzi lwabantu
baseDe Doorns. Le bhulorho iza kucutha inani leengozi, njengoko abantu
abaninzi bebetshayiswa ziimoto xa bebuya emsebenzini benqumla indlela
besiya kumatyotyombe abo, abanye bevela kufolela imisebenzi.

Singabahlali baseNorth Side nabaseSouth Side ku-N1 siyabulela kumasipala
norhulumente wephondo bebambisene ne-SA National Road Agency Ltd
ngokuqinisekisa ukuba amathuba emisebenzi ayavuleka, kwanokuba abantu baza
kusinda ekutshayisweni ziimoto. Kwakhona abantu baza kukwazi ukuya
ezikliniki, ezikolweni nasezivenkileni ezikwelinye icala lika-N1.

Siyabakhuthaza nabanye abaneenjongo zokuphuhlisa kulaa mmandla ukuba
benjenjalo. Abahlali balaa ndawo basezintwaleni, bafuna ukuhlanjululwa
ngamabhakethi eJeyes Fluid. Yizani kutyala imali eDe Doorns. Enkosi.
(Translation of isiXhosa member’s statement follows.)

[Mr M M DIKGACWI (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, we note with joy and genuine
happiness the bridge that has just been erected at De Doorns. Due to
political pressures, there was no land that had been earmarked for such a
bridge.

We also note that the amount of R20 million that was used to build this
bridge created job opportunities for many of the people of De Doorns. This
bridge will reduce the number of accidents, because a number of people used
to be knocked down by vehicles when going to and coming from work, having
to cross the highway on the way back to their shacks, some coming from
seeking jobs.

As residents of North Side and South Side, along the N1, we would like to
thank the municipality and the provincial government, in collaboration with
the SA National Road Agency Ltd, for ensuring that job opportunities were
created and that people will no longer be knocked down by vehicles.
Furthermore, the people will now be able to go to the clinics, schools and
shops on the other side of the N1.

We encourage others who intend to develop that area to do likewise. The
residents of that area have problems with an infestation of fleas. They
need to cleanse the area using buckets of Jeyes Fluid. Come and invest at
De Doorns. Thank you.]

                               MALARIA VACCINE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs C DUDLEY (ACDP): Deputy Speaker, the ACDP welcomes breakthrough
research in the United States in developing a vaccine against malaria. We
are encouraged by news of an American scientist leading an international
team of researchers to produce a vaccine against malaria.

As Africans we all know the terrible toll taken by malaria every year, with
an especially heavy toll on infants. Whilst we are pleased that companies
are establishing industries in malarial areas and are endeavouring to
protect their staff through the use of DDT, we, however, recognise that DDT
has its own negative effects and is not the ultimate solution.

So it is with real hope that the ACDP recognises the work being carried out
by a biotechnology firm in Maryland, using malarial mosquitoes themselves
to manufacture a vaccine against malaria.
Although there is a long way to go before they will be able to license it
and deploy it as an effective eradication method, this vaccine brings hope.
It promises the birth of economy and prosperity in ravaged areas, and could
save lives.

We look forward also to developments in this regard within South Africa’s
science and technology sector. Thank you.

                   MURDER OF THREE FEMALE LAUNDRY WORKERS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms D M RAMODIBE (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the ANC I rise to
bring to the attention of the House and share with you and the nation at
large, one of the challenges faced by our new democracy, as the country
advances towards transforming itself into a nonracial, nonsexist, united
and democratic society.

In the constituency where I am deployed in Vanderbijlpark near Vereeniging,
I have been following up a case of three female workers, namely Joyce
Lesito (28), Constance Moeletsi (30) and Victoria Ndweni (30). In 2006 they
were allegedly placed into a dry cleaning washing machine that contained
chemicals. They were later found dead.

The administration of justice should be accessible to all the people. It
must be credible and legitimate. The case against the accused dragged on in
the Vereeniging Magistrate’s Court and was delayed by bail applications for
the perpetrators. They were later granted bail, despite public objections
and demonstrations by the ANC Women’s League and the alliance partners.

The case has now been put in abeyance or suspended, pending further
investigation. It was alleged that there was not enough evidence against
the accused. I call on the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development to investigate this very serious matter. I thank you.




                      SLOW PACE of Land REDISTRIBUTION


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M V NGEMA (Nadeco): Madam Speaker, poverty is the parent of revolution
and crime. This is an observation that was made by academic and
philosopher, Aristotle. It was this statement that came to mind when the
media report seen over the weekend stated that less than 5% of agricultural
land has been transferred into black hands since 1994.

The issue of land will continue to open wounds for the people of this
country. Reports of widespread protests against the slow pace of white-
owned farmlands being transferred into black hands and delays in
compensating families who were forced off their land during apartheid are
disturbing, owing to the fact that the people were promised the transfer of
30% of white-owned farmlands by 2014. This year only 258 890 hectares have
been redistributed, which is almost 40 000 hectares less than in 2002.

South Africans have been extremely patient and understanding with regard to
the issue of land redistribution. However, when there are reports of
widespread underperformance in the redistribution of land ... [Time

                      SUSPENSION OF ABALONE HARVESTING

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnr I F JULIES (DA): Mevrou die Speaker, die Minister van Omgewingsake en
Toerisme se besluit om die oes van perlemoen stop te sit sal slegs die
wettige vissers straf terwyl die stropers steeds sal voortgaan met hulle
kriminele bedrywighede. Deur dié stap sal die Minister juis die
belanghebbendes verloor wat ’n rol speel in die beskerming van die vissery.

Wat gaan nou gebeur met wettige perlemoenvissers? Hulle sal in armoede
verval. Die Regering se plan om ’n maatskaplike armoedeverligtingsplan
bekend te stel om hierdie vissermanne te help sal nie werk nie. Dit is wel
waar dat Suid-Afrika ’n perlemoenakwakultuurbedryf nodig het, maar dit sal
jare neem om opbrengste te toon en dus ook om die vissers van ’n inkomste
te voorsien.

Die grootste probleem met die perlemoenbedryf is dat 300 wettige
perlemoenvissermanne en 700 ander wat betrokke is by die verwerking van
perlemoen miljoene rande belê het in fabrieke en in bote. Die kapitaal is
nou bestee en dit is onwaarskynlik dat dit oorgedra kan word na ander
visserye, wat reeds oorgekapitaliseer is. Daar is baie vissermanne wat die
banke baie geld skuld vir bates waarvoor hulle nou nie meer sal kan betaal
nie.

Die DA versoek die Minister om dringend sy besluit te heroorweeg en om so
spoedig moontlik met die wettige vissermanne te vergader om die
gemeenskaplike bestuur van hierdie hulpbron te bespreek. Baie dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr I F JULIES (DA): Madam Speaker, the Minister of Environmental Affairs
and Tourism’s decision to put a stop to abalone harvesting will only punish
legal fishermen while poachers will continue with their criminal
activities. By taking this step the Minister will, in fact, lose the
interested parties who play a role in the protection of the fishing
industry.

What is going to happen to legal abalone fishers? They will fall into
poverty. The government’s plan to introduce a social poverty alleviation
plan to assist these fishermen won’t work. It is, indeed, true that South
Africa needs an abalone aquaculture industry, but it will take years to
show a return as well as supplying the fishermen with an income.

The biggest problem in the abalone industry is that 300 legal abalone
fishermen and 700 others who are involved with abalone processing have
invested millions of rands in factories and boats. The capital has already
been spent and it is unlikely that it can be transferred to other
fisheries, which are already overcapitalised. There are many fishermen who
owe the banks a lot of money for assets they will no longer be able to pay
for.

The DA requests the Minister to reconsider his decision as a matter of
urgency and to meet with the legal fishermen as soon as possible to discuss
the joint management of this resource. Thank you very much.]

                        MURDER OF DR “POX” REGHAVJEE

Prof S M MAYATULA (ANC): Somlomo, into yokugetyengwa ngokumasikizi kuka-Gqr
“Pox” Reghavjee eQonce ngentsasa yayizolo, ilanga lihlabe umhlaba,
isothusile, kwaye isivusele umnyele thina bantu baseMpuma Koloni. Lo

kwabomthetho nakuluntu ngokubanzi ukuba lubambisane ukulwa nalo mthyoli
ukuze kufunyanwe abenzi bobu bubi. Enkosi. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of
isiXhosa member’s statement follows.)

[Prof S M MAYATULA (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, the brutal murder of Dr
“Pox” Reghavjee in Queenstown, yesterday morning, in broad daylight, has
shocked us and has disturbed us as the people of the Eastern Cape. This was
a people’s doctor who helped us greatly during the apartheid era in
Queenstown and surrounding areas. To those who killed him we say: Beware
the long arm of the law. We would like to plead with law enforcement
officials to co-operate in fighting this abomination so that the
perpetrators of this crime may be brought to book. [Applause.]]

                       SCOURGE OF VIOLENCE AT SCHOOLS

                            (Member’s Statement)
Ms C N Z ZIKALALA (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, we are in a crisis and do
not seem to have any solutions at hand. The level of violence in and around
our schools has spiralled out of control. A Durban teacher was stabbed and
robbed of her vehicle as she was leaving her school in Marianhill
yesterday. The incident happened just a few days after 23 teachers were
held up at Savanna Park Secondary School, near Marianhill.

The future of our children and grandchildren looks bleak. They are not able
to concentrate on their school activities as they have to be vigilant for
acts of violence and criminal activities.

The only way that we will overcome this scourge is for all of us to work
together and try our utmost to find lasting solutions. It is unacceptable
that learners do not feel safe in their schools.

The future of our country and of our youth needs to be liberated from the
unscrupulous criminals who are holding them hostage and who seem to commit
their criminal activities at will. The culture of violence and lack of
respect must be stopped before it takes root in our society and becomes the
norm. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

                   IMPROVED SERVICE DELIVERY IN SOSHANGUVE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr H P MALULEKA (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, Soshanguve is one of the
biggest townships in Tshwane, which, like many of our townships, is still
lagging behind as regards some essential services. Our government has
established a number of departments within the township. Residents of
Soshanguve now have services provided on their doorstep by the following
government departments: Labour; Correctional Services; Justice; SA Police
Service; Social Development; Home Affairs; and GCIS.

We would like to thank the MEC for Social Development in Gauteng, Mr
Kgaogelo Lekgoro, for his quick response after we brought to his attention
the need for more resources for social workers who work in Soshanguve. The
MEC has made the following tools of the trade available to our social
workers: computers with 3-G connectivity, four cars of which two are
subsidised, and office space, which is currently being renovated. We have
also been informed that social workers who are not office-bound will be
provided with cellphones.

These interventions can only mean improved service delivery and the
realisation of our commitment to create a better life for all.
I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

             KAUSHIK PATEL NAMED CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF SAA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr S M VAN DYK (DA): Deputy Speaker, last week SAA appointed Kaushik Patel,
the former chief financial officer of Telkom, as its new chief financial
officer. No mention was made of this to the Portfolio Committee on Public
Enterprises, which was briefed by the airline a week before.

SAA’s overstretched board is known not to pay attention when it matters
most and therefore this situation creates suspicion and concern. Just take
into account that Mr Patel will be SAA’s fourth CFO in only one year.
Members will agree with me that this is a highly unusual situation for a
multi-billion rand company to be in.

It is also the same year in which SAA Chief Executive ``Emperor`` Khaya
Ngqula promised to turn the state airline’s R883 million loss into a R47
million net profit. Of course, seeing is believing. Given SAA’s performance
under him, Ngqula’s abilities are by no means proven.

Along with the fact that he has a hand in at least 22 other companies, he
will need all the assistance he can get to turn SAA around. About 2 232
employees will lose their jobs to save R863 million. They need to know that
this is not for nothing.

Another R3 billion in taxpayer’s funds have been requested from Treasury,
of which R1,3 billion has already been paid for recapitalisation.
South Africans need to know that Mr Patel’s appointment was the culmination
of an exhaustive process to find a CFO to guard the taxpayer’s ever-
increasing investment in SAA. Public Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin needs
to provide that assurance to Parliament.
Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

                              ELDORADO PARK FM

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr S J NJIKELANA (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, my statement is about another
creative and dynamic development tool for Eldorado Park.

On 15 September, history was made in Eldorado Park in the Deep South around
Johannesburg when Eldorado Park FM was formalised. Whilst the establishment
of community radio stations is a growing activity in South Africa, the
uniqueness of Eldorado Park FM is confirmed by the composition of its board
of directors, which is well balanced in terms of gender, race and age
grouping.

What was also admirable was the effort put in by the youth empowerment
network of Eldorado Park in relentlessly pursuing this project to its
current stage of development. The board of Eldorado Park FM committed
itself to promoting community values and a true sense of South Africanness.
There was a clear commitment that various languages other than English and
Afrikaans would also be used.

Participation from the areas that will be covered will be strongly
encouraged and adhered to. Areas that will benefit are Slovo Park, Kliptown
and Klipspruit in Soweto and Freedom Park as well as Eldorado Park itself.
Even local councillors have endorsed the intention for the station to cover
local activities in the City of Johannesburg regarding service delivery and
development projects generally. Thank you. [Applause.]

      DEPARTURE OF DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS AND
                          PERFORMANCE OF DEPARTMENT

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnr A H NEL (DA): Dit is vanoggend aangekondig dat die Minister van Landbou
en Grondsake en die Direkteur-generaal van Grondsake ooreengekom het dat sy
dienste beëindig word.

Die hele saga spruit voort uit mnr Glen Thomas se bywoning van die
Wêreldbeker-eindstryd waar hy, ongelukkig vir hom, op televisie gesien is.
Dit wys ‘n mens hoe ‘n gevaarlike spel rugby is! [Gelag.]
Feit is egter dat Grondsake al ‘n geruime tyd nie presteer nie. Die

Minister het die department laat ondersoek deur die Staatsdienskommissie.
Die President het sy ontevredenheid uitgespreek met die leiding van die
department wat, volgens hom, net beplan, maar niks uitvoer nie.

Die Minister en haar Adjunk kan egter nie agter rugby skuil nie. Hulle moes
al lankal opgetree het. Hulle het hul plig versuim. (Translation of
Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr A H NEL (DA): It was announced this morning that the Minister of
Agriculture and Land Affairs and the Director-General of Land Affairs have
agreed that his services would be terminated.

The whole saga resulted from Mr Glen Thomas attending the World Cup Final
where, unfortunately for him, he was seen on television. This goes to show
what a dangerous game rugby really is! [Laughter.]

However, the fact is that Land Affairs has not been performing for quite
some time. The Minister has had the department investigated by the Public
Service Commission. The President has expressed his dissatisfaction with
the leadership of the department, which, according to him, only plans, but
never carries anything out.

The Minister and her Deputy cannot hide behind rugby, however. They should
have acted long ago. They have neglected their duties.]

            AIDS STATISTICS AND THE NEED TO REVISE AIDS POLICIES

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): Deputy Speaker, the recent comments from the United
Nations Children’s Fund that our country has lost the Aids battle give us
cause for concern.

One hears reports from various sectors of the Health department that the
numbers of people with HIV are decreasing in certain categories. However,
statistics that have been issued by the statistical bodies monitoring the
Aids epidemic in South Africa indicate that, although their statistics are
not identical, in all categories the numbers of people suffering from HIV
are increasing, and the numbers of people who will die from HIV will
increase from the current 1 000 per day to 1 100 or 1 200 per day in the
coming years.

That being the case, something drastic should be done about our current
Aids policies. The Minister of Finance’s voting of additional money to
fight HIV and tuberculosis is not the answer. Thank you.

        AGENDA TO TOPPLE DA-LED MULTIPARTY GOVERNMENT IN WESTERN CAPE

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Deputy Speaker, obviously the fear of
the ongoing investigation into the case that the hon Botha has referred to,
is causing them sleepless nights. Hon Botha, the fact of the matter is that
your entire leadership is running scared. Do you remember the English
phrase that says, “the guilty are afraid”? I am sure you can recall that.

The fact that you are trying to divert attention from the DA and the
possibility that there is more that is going to be uncovered in the
investigation, is causing you sleepless nights; but we are going to
continue to investigate the case. If a crime has been committed, we will
investigate. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, please, hon members!

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Deputy Speaker, with respect to the proposed
occupation-specific dispensation, which I have placed before the Education
and Labour Relations Council, it’s important, perhaps, to say to the member
who made the statement that it is vital in negotiations that you don’t
negotiate in the media. Therefore, what we have done is to meet with the
union representatives, and my department and the unions are discussing the
areas in which there appear to be different approaches with respect to the
model.

I shall just repeat that what we would want to achieve is, of course, an
occupation-specific dispensation for teachers that must be achieved in
terms of the agreement reached in the Public Service bargaining chamber.
That dispensation must be linked to performance assessment, because we have
agreed that performance has to be a core part of the model. It must support
career pathing in a positive fashion for educators in service; it must
recognise experience; it must encourage qualifications and recognise them;
and it must also support us in retaining scarce skills in the critical core
subjects or gateway subjects: maths, science and technology.

We hope that the final model, which I trust will be agreed to, and which I
think we know is as far apart as our statements in the media may indicate,
will at least have these core principles enshrined in it.

On the matter of violence in schools, clearly, this is an aspect that all
of us should be worried about. I think what we should be doing is to engage
our young people in our communities, in our homes and in our schools, to
begin to share a set of core values that we would promote and hope young
people would espouse the notion that when there is a quarrel you resolve it
without a knife, a gun or a dangerous object; if you differ, you discuss
the difference and arrive at an agreement.

I think this Parliament has great experience at finding one another in a
range of domains. We need to transmit that manner of conflict resolution to
the children of our country and, as parents, play a greater role in shaping
the moral fibre of our children and not just leave this to teachers. Apart
from the rules and measures we put in place each of us, as South Africans,
have a role to play.

                      SUSPENSION OF ABALONE HARVESTING

                            (Minister’s Response)

Die MINISTER VAN OMGEWINGSAKE EN TOERISME: Speaker, ek wil graag reageer op
die agb Julies van die DA se verklaring oor die kommer oor die opskorting
van perlemoenvangste.

Laat ek dadelik sê dit is nie ’n besluit wat ons maklik geneem het nie,
maar dit is ook nie die eerste keer dat dit gebeur in ons visbedryf nie.
Daar is al voorheen sulke noodtoestande verklaar ten opsigte van sommige
van die visbronne waar daar ’n probleem was.

Wat met die perlemoen gebeur, is dat hierdie bron jaar ná jaar besig is om
dramaties te krimp. Dit het oor die afgelope dekades gekrimp van ’n
jaarlikse kwota van duisende ton na 600 ton enkele jare gelede, en tot
slegs 125 ton verlede jaar.

By al die besluite wat ons neem, neem ons ’n sterk wetenskaplike inset in
berekening. Wat baie belangrik is, is dat ons dit nie net gaan opskort het
nie. Ons het ook daarmee saam ’n maatskaplike plan aangekondig om die impak
te versag op dié mense wat geraak word, maar ons weet almal dit is baie
moeilik om die impak 100% uit te skakel.

Dis ’n baie moeilike besluit vir enige regering om te neem. Ek vergader
later vanmiddag met Cosatu en Masifundisi. Ons het niks om weg te steek
nie. Die besluit wat ons neem, is ’n besluit waarvan ons die inligting met
enigiemand kan deel, en ek is selfs bereid om dit direk met Cosatu te
bespreek.

Môreoggend sal ek ook aan die portefeuljekomitee ’n deeglike voorlegging
daaroor doen, maar dis ’n moeilike besluit en ons kyk na alle opsies om te
kyk of ons nie steeds die impak kan versag nie. [Applous.] (Translation of
Afrikaans Minister’s response follows.)

[The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Speaker, I would like
to respond to the hon Julies of the DA’s statement regarding the concern
about the suspension of abalone fishing.

Let me say immediately that this is not a decision that we took lightly,
but it is also not the first time that this has happened in our fishing
industry. Such states of emergency have been declared before with regard to
some of the fish resources where there was a problem.

What has happened to the abalone is that this resource is diminishing
drastically year after year. Over the last few decades it has declined from
a yearly quota of thousands of tons to 600 tons a few years back, and to
only 125 tons last year.

In all the decisions we take, we take a strong scientific input into
account. What is very important is that we are not simply going to suspend
it. Along with it we also announced a social plan to soften the impact on
those people who are affected, but we all know that it is very difficult to
eradicate the impact 100%.

It is a very difficult decision for any government to take. Later this
afternoon I will be meeting with Cosatu and Masifundisi. We have nothing to
hide. The decision we are taking is a decision we can share the information
of with anyone, and I am even prepared to discuss it with Cosatu directly.

Tomorrow morning I will also give a thorough presentation on it to the
portfolio committee, but it is a difficult decision and we have to look at
all the options to see if we can’t still soften the impact. [Applause.]]




                        MURDER OF DR “POX” REGHAVJEE


                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Deputy Speaker, I am only taking the
one issue, which is on the murder of Dr “Pox” Reghavjee, because there is a
Minister for the one on correctional services, and that is the Deputy
Minister of Correctional Services.

Malunga no Gqr “Pox” Reghavjee eQonce, sithumela imiyalezo yosizi novelwano
kusapho lwakhe nakubantu beelali zonke zasekhaya, nezijikeleze idolophu
yaseQonce. Ukugetyengwa kwalo qgirha wabantu kusothusile sonke. Kwabo benze
obu bubi neli nyala lihlasimlisa umzimba sithi, ingalo yomthetho inde.

Amapolisa aphume iphulo njengokuba ndithetha nje, athe mbende emva kwabo
ukuze ababambe abo sathana. Niyaya emaplangeni, kanti naseKokstad
entolongweni ndinilindile. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[With regard to the murder of Dr “Pox” Reghavjee in Queenstown, we would
like to convey our condolences to his family and to the people of the
villages surrounding Queenstown. The murder of this people’s doctor has
shocked all of us. To those who have committed this heinous deed we would
like to say: beware the long arm of the law.
The police are investigating as we speak. They are tracking them down so
that they may arrest these devils. You are going to appear in court and I
am waiting for you at the Kokstad prison.

                               CORRECTION WEEK

                              ELDORADO PARK FM

                           (Minister’s Responses)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Deputy Speaker, I want to
respond to the statement made by the hon Chikunga as well as that of the
hon Njikelana.

Firstly, I want to welcome the statement of the hon Chikunga, and secondly,
to re-emphasise the call of the hon member to all of us to mobilise and
rally our communities behind the Department of Correctional Services call
to make corrections, rehabilitation, and social reintegration the
responsibility of all South Africans in order to ensure a safer and more
secure South Africa.

Lastly, I would like to remind the members of the yellow ribbon campaign –
and I only see the Minister and myself wearing our yellow ribbons - since I
explained the purpose of the yellow ribbon campaign last week. It is aimed
at embracing ex-offenders upon their release and encouraging them to live
crime-free lives and join the majority of people who are upright citizens
of this country.

On the second statement by the hon Njikelana, I would also like to
congratulate Eldorado Park FM on their launch in September 2007, and hope
that the community of Eldorado Park and beyond will use this radio station
to increase their participation in local, provincial and national
government.

Lastly, I would like to call on Eldorado Park FM to raise topical matters
that will assist, not just that community but all South Africans, to bring
to the attention of law makers issues that will enable them to create a
better life for all. Thank you. [Applause]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Deputy Minister, I do apologise for my pink rose.
Thank you. [Laughter.]


            AGENDA TO TOPPLE MULTIPARTY GOVERNMET IN WESTERN CAPE


                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Deputy Speaker, those who shout the loudest
about democracy respect it the least. They must explain to us, because
before you intercept anybody’s communications you need a court order. Did
they have a court order or not? Do not come here, digress, and talk of
something else or somebody else getting reports without telling us whether
they did or did not have a court order. They paid this money ...

Mr M J ELLIS: Deputy Speaker, may I rise on the point of order to say that
we have already had a response from a Minister to the hon Sandra Botha on
this matter, and I believe the Rules imply that there should be only one
ministerial response to each issue. Thank you.

THE LEADER OF THE OFFICIAL OPPOSTION: Madam Deputy Speaker, I would be
delighted to have a second one. Thank you.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Yes, that is your democratic right. That is
the first point. The second point is that they must come clean. Did the DA
and that speaker intercept the communications of their own members or their
allies such as the ID without a court order or not? Surely we need to come
clean on those questions, because if you did that I want to know what
respect you have for democracy. The third point is that the DA knows ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members! I need to be able to follow what is
being said in the House and you ...

Mr M J ELLIS: It is not worth following.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is worth following from where I am sitting.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Ag, laat hulle skreeu man, [Oh, let them
shout], because there is nothing else they can do. The third point is that
they know that it is not in the power of the Minister or the Premier or
anybody else to charge people. That is the responsibility of the
Directorate of Public Prosecutions, but those who feel aggrieved by what Mr
Chabaan has done have a right to go and charge him. So why do we stand
here, under the protection of this Chamber, and make these statements? Go
and lay a charge, because that is your democratic right.

The last point that I want to make is that if you respect democracy you
will, therefore, respect the fact that this side of the House has 70% of
the legislative powers here in South Africa. Respect democracy. [Time
expired.][Applause.]




                   MURDER OF THREE FEMALE LAUNDRY WORKERS


                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Yes, interception
without permission is a crime. There is a charge for that.

My sister ...
... ke batla go tlatsa polelo e e dirilweng ke wena ka kgang ya batho ba ba
neng ba bolawa ba bo ba tsenngwa kwa ditshelong tsa “dry-clean”. Ditopo tsa
bona tsa fitlhelwa koo.

Ke tla bowa ke bega sentle ka kgang e. Gona re diegile mme le rona re

[... I would like to support you on the issue you have raised in your
statement, namely the issue of people who were killed and then stuffed into
dry-cleaning machines. Their corpses were then hidden there.

The truth of the matter is, our people were seriously affected. Our people
are still writing to us, asking us whether we are doing something about
this.
At the beginning of this case, while we were investigating it, we were told
that some mistakes had been made in the meantime. We did not discover
exactly what had happened.

I wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions requesting him to give us a
full report. I hope the report will come. It will help us as the Executive
to condemn the perpetrators if need be and encourage them to do their work
as expected.

I will come back to report in full on this issue. Indeed, we took some
time, but we are also awaiting answers. Thank you.]

The House adjourned at 15:29.

National Assembly

1.    The Speaker

    (a)     Agreement between the Republic of South Africa and the
        Government of the Republic of Cuba on the Employment of Technical
        Advisors, tabled in terms of section 231(3) of the Constitution,
        1996.


    (b)     Letter from the Minister for Public Enterprises, dated 25
        October 2007, to the Speaker of the National Assembly, in terms of
        section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No
        1 of 1999), explaining the delay in the tabling of the Annual
        Report of Arivia.kom for 2006-2007.


         TABLING OF ARIVIA.KOM’s FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2006 – 2007
      Dear Speaker


      In terms of section 65 (1)(a) and (2) of the Public Finance
         Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), as amended, I am required
         to table Arivia.kom’s Annual Report and Financial Statements in
         Parliament within six months after the end of the financial year to
         which those Statements relate. As Arivia.kom’s financial year ended
         31 March 2007, the Annual Report and Financial Statements must be
         tabled in Parliament not later that 30 September 2007.


      We are in the process of winding down this state-owned entity. Since
         our last submission the shareholding in the company has changed
         resulting in Eskom Enterprises now the major shareholder with 58,5%
         and Transnet 41,5% of Arivia.com. No Annual Report for Arivia.com
         has therefore been prepared for the financial year 2006/7. Audited
         financial statements for that period however are available. In
         compliance with the PFMA requirements I therefore wish to table the
         Arivia.kom’s financial statements before Parliament.


      Kind regards




        ALEC ERWIN, MP
         MINISTER OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES
