QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY



THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT


  National Youth Service Volunteer Campaign, the National Youth Service and
                                    Jipsa

1.    Mr S E Kholwane (ANC) asked the Deputy President:



      (1)   (a) What is the main purpose of the National Youth Service
            Volunteer Campaign which was launched on 4 December 2006, (b)
            what are the key objectives being pursued by this initiative
            and (c) how does this campaign relate to the mandate of the
            National Youth Service (NYS);



      (2)   whether this campaign will address the question of youth
           development and training in relation to the objectives of the
           Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition (Jipsa); if so,
           in what way?                                       N247E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, hon members, I would like to start by
explaining the difference between the National Youth Service Volunteer
Campaign and the National Youth Service. The main difference between the
two initiatives is that in the volunteer campaign, we have a short-term
intervention which aims to get young people to participate in volunteer
programmes during vacations and holidays, for example, and engage in
developmental community activities such as crime prevention, peer
education, marine and costal management as well as support to vulnerable
children. On the contrary the National Youth Service Programme, which is a
long-term intervention running between 12 to 18 months, includes accredited
technical training, life skills training and supervised community service.

The key objectives of the National Youth Service Volunteer Campaign are to
inculcate a civic responsibility culture amongst the youth, in keeping with
Asgisa and other objectives of government of creating a caring and a
sharing society; to raise awareness and the profile of the National Youth
Service programme and to foster co-operation amongst national communities
and stakeholders that partner with government departments.

It is our duty, as government, to demonstrate that everyone and all our
young people can play a productive role in the development and in caring
for most vulnerable people in our society. The volunteer campaign was
launched in December 2005 and, therefore, has had an opportunity to impact
on a larger number of young people.

We would urge members to encourage young people in their constituencies to
make themselves available for the short-term volunteer campaign as well as
for the longer-term National Youth Service programme which, for many of the
young people who are unemployed, at risk and in need of skills, would be a
more life-enhancing experience. Thank you.

Mr S E KHOLWANE: Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Deputy President
for a comprehensive response. My question is: How can these young women and
men access the programme in general, especially those in deep rural areas?
Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon member, I have to say I also feel that the
promotion and advertising of this programme is not as effective as it
should be. On the one hand, we need to make the information available to as
many young people as possible so that they know how to access the
programme, but we are also conscious that we do not want to over-advertise
and be unable to accommodate all of the young people whose interest we
would have generated.

In part, we would like to rely on municipalities to engage, to select and
to encourage young people to do that and, of course, our GCIS should also
be involved. I would take responsibility and admit that there are some
improvements that need to be made about advertising and promoting this
programme. I would also like to offer information to the members here so
that, through your constituency offices, you can also assist us to close
the gap. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M M SWATHE: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, it would be interesting to
know how many youth formations were invited to participate in the
initiative, and whether the wholly ineffective National Youth Commission
has any role to play. Given the fact that the biggest problem amongst the
youth is joblessness, could you please advise the House on the role the
National Youth Service Volunteer Campaign will play in helping to encourage
the acquisition of new skills? Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: I would start by defending the National Youth
Commission. It is not an ineffective institution. [Interjections.] Sorry?
[Interjections.] OK, you can send a message to Kader, I won’t. I interact
with them. I know that the current National Youth Commission, for instance,
has been in place for a couple of months and the previous commission had
teething problems. And I think one of the things that the new commission
has embarked upon is to close the gap in those areas where the previous
commission was weak.

There is no blanket answer about the strengths and weaknesses of the
National Youth Commission, because in some provinces they are much stronger
and in some provinces they are weaker. It is a matter of ensuring that
where they are strong, we help them to do better and where they are weak,
we strengthen them.

To answer the question, the National Youth Commission is an integral part
of developing and implementing these programmes. In fact, in relation to
the national volunteer service, there are now almost 30 000 young people
that are participating. Most of them have been recruited through the
structures of the National Youth Commission in different parts of the
country. In those provinces where the National Youth Commission is
stronger, it is reflected by the number of young people who have been able
to stay in the programme and finish. But there are some provinces where the
success is not something I would write to my mother about. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Sekela-Mongameli obekekileyo, ngaba uyangqina na ukuba
iNkonzo yeSizwe yokuXhobisa uLutsha, okanye iNational Youth Service
ngesilungu, kunye nenkonzo yobuvolontiya, ngamaphulo amabini abaluleke
kakhulu? Ngaphandle kokufundisa ulutsha umsebenzi ukuze lungazibandakanyi
kulwaphulo-mthetho, akwabalulekile ekuvuseleleni izimilo ezweni lethu,
ukwenzela ukuba ulutsha luzingce ngelizwe lalo. Ngaba uyakungqina na oko,
Sekela-Mongameli?

USEKELA-MONGAMELI: Somlomo obekekileyo nelungu elibekekileyo elibuze
umbuzo, ndiyangqina ukuba eli phulo libaluleke gqitha. Mandiphinde nditsho
ukuba ukuqoqosha izimilo zolutsha yeyona nto ibalulekileyo ekufanele ukuba
siyenze njengamalungu ePalamente nanjengabantu abasele bebadala.

Kungoko ke, ngokubhekisele kwiNkonzo yeSizwe yokuXhobisa uLutsha,
singathanda ukucebisa abantwana ukuba bahlale kule nkonzo ixes ha
eliziinyanga ukugqitha enyakeni kuba singathanda ukubabona betshintshile
nkqu nendlela le yokuhamba xa bephuma kulo. Nikhe nibabone xa behamba
bekekele, le nto elokishini yam kwakusithiwa kukubhampa? Sifuna ukuba xa
bephuma kweli phulo bangabhampi koko bahambe kakuhle ngendlela enesimilo.
Enkosi. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Adv Z L MADASA: Hon Deputy President, do you agree that both the National
Youth Service programme and the National Youth Service Volunteer Campaign
are important? In addition to training youth in job-related skills in order
to help them avoid being involved in criminal activities, these campaigns
play a critical role in moral regeneration that would in turn motivate them
so that they could be proud of their country.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Speaker and the hon member who has asked the
question, I agree that this campaign is important. Let me reiterate that as
Members of Parliament and the elders, we need to inculcate in our youth a
sense of moral regeneration as one of the most important things.

It is for that reason that we, in the National Youth Commission, would like
to advise our children to remain in this church for a period of about a
year; starting from this month. Have you seen them waddling? In my township
we used to refer to this kind of walk as "bumping". We want to see them
moving and walking decently after training. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Somlomo, mhlonishwa Phini likaMongameli, lubasiza kuphi lolo
hlelo laba abancane ekucosheni imisebenzi uma sebephuma lapho? [Madam
Speaker, hon Deputy President, how does this programme help the youth to
get employment after leaving it?]

USEKELA-MONGAMELI: Somlomo, abanye babantu abasele beqalile ukungena
kwiNkonzo yeSizwe yokuXhobisa uLutsha bathi bengekayigqibi babe sele
bebonwa ngabaqeshi, baze abo baqeshi babaqeshe. Siyazama ukugxininisa kubo
ukuba xa ubani eziphethe kakuhle, waqhuba kakuhle, uza kukhawuleza
ukufumana umsebenzi. Loo nto inceda ekubeni bafumaneke abasebenzi
abafanelekileyo. Kanti enye into entle kukuba siyakwazi ukubabona
abanezakhono, ekubonakalayo ukuba kufuneka babuyele esikolweni. Bathi xa
bephuma kweli phulo sibe sesibazamela indlela yokuba babuyele esikolweni
baye kuqhubela phambili imfundo yabo.

Njengokuba ngoku sele kukho iikholeji zokufundela imisebenzi, okanye ii-FET
college ngesilungu, singathanda ukuba abo bafundela umsebenzi wezandla
bathi xa bephuma apho baye kungena kwinkqubo yokufundela umsebenzi kwezi
kholeji.

Okwesithathu, singathanda ukuba kubekho inkqubo abaphumela kuyo.
Besingekakwazi ke ukuwucwangcisa kakuhle lo mba ngoba besisalindele
uMphathiswa wezeziMali ukuze sibone ukuba usipha malini khon’ ukuze sibe
nokuseka inkqubo eza kubanika izakhono ukuze xa bephuma kweli phulo sikwazi
ukubasebenzisa.

Ngoku sicela ukuba sibambisane nemibutho engekho phantsi kukarhulumente,
iinkampani kwanamasebe ukuze xa ifuna abantu abanezakhono ezithile baze
kukhangela kwaba bantwana. Abanye babo sifuna ukuba babe ngoosomashishini
abazimeleyo. Sifuna ukuba  bathi xa bephuma kweli phulo aba bakhayo, abe
umntu enebhokisi yakhe yokugcina izixhobo zokusebenza anokuyisebenzisa
ukuya kufuna umsebenzi.

Kwakhona, sifuna ukusebenzisa eli phulo lokuba urhulumente abonelele
ngesixa-mali esithile ukukhawulelana nomvuzo wabo baqalayo ukusebenza
athethe ngalo uMongameli ukunceda abanye babantu abatsha ngoba kuya kuba
lula ukubafumana nokubamba udliwanondlebe nabo. Enkosi. (Translation of
isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, some of the people who have already
started with the National Youth Service programme are poached by
prospective employers before completing their training. We are trying to
highlight to them that if they conduct themselves accordingly and perform
well they will get a job easily. That helps in getting suitable candidates.
We can also easily identify people with potential who would need to go for
further training. After training we ensure that they go for further
training.

Now that there are also FET colleges, we would like to encourage those who
are being trained in handicraft to go and study further at these colleges.

Thirdly, we would also like to put in place development programmes that
would employ them as soon as they have completed their training. We have
not been able to do proper planning, as we have been waiting on the
Minister of Finance for our budget allocation that would enable us to set
up a programme that would provide skills to them so that after they have
been trained we could employ them.

Therefore, we request that we work in partnership with non-governmental
organisations, companies and departments so that when they need people with
certain skills, they may select from them. We would like some of them to be
set up in their own companies. We want to empower those who train in
building and construction so much so that on completion of their training,
each one of them has a complete tool box with which they could market
themselves.

Furthermore, we would like to follow up on the President’s proposal that
the government should consider providing financial assistance to meet the
financial needs and augment the salaries of some of the newly employed
youth, because it would be easy to attract them for interviews. Thank you.]

       High crime rate a constraint for investment and economic growth

2.    Dr S M van Dyk (DA) asked the Deputy President:

      Whether, in light of the World Bank’s recent investment climate survey
      findings as well as that of Grant Thornton regarding the high crime
      rate as a constraint for further investment and growth (details
      furnished), she will add crime as the seventh binding constraint to
      economic growth under the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for
      South Africa (Asgisa); if not, why not; if so, what measures will be
      implemented in order to deal with this constraint?
                                   N243E
The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker and hon members, the answer to the
question is: Crime is one of the government’s major focus areas. Its
importance is not just in reference to Asgisa, but it is an overarching
challenge that the government is focussed on, and therefore we do not have
to regard it and to include it as necessarily one of the bounding
constrains. The fight against crime has to intensify whether there is
Asgisa or not.

As already announced, some of the measures that are to be instituted in
this regard will include the increase of the police officers, as was
announced by the President; the augmentation of the ICT-based forensic
science laboratory for processing DNA by the establishment of another
facility in the Western Cape; and the capacity of the intelligence division
of the police which is being increased, both in terms of the number of
officers and in terms of enabling technical infrastructure. The cluster
intends to sustain measures intended to arrest and prosecute repeat
offenders, particularly those responsible for serious and violent crimes.

Similarly, the operations to prevent crime in the places and at times when
it mostly occurs will be sustained. In this regard, the government
particularly wants to massively reduce house burglaries. It is in this
particular time that terror visits most people, the sense of insecurity
that people feel in their homes. These are the few areas that I am
mentioning in which we intend to intensify crime prevention. Of course, the
list of our interventions is longer. Thank you.

Dr S M VAN DYK: Madam Speaker, this is Asgisa and economic development. The
Deputy President does not recognise crime as a barrier to economic
development. So, the hon Deputy President, therefore, does not agree that
crime is a barrier to Asgisa, despite the fact that South Africa’s murder
rate is eight times higher that the world’s average.

Does this mean that the government accepts that 18 000 murders per annum is
reasonable, despite the fact that many of those murdered were highly
skilled people contributing to our economy? Is the hon Deputy President not
in agreement that the unacceptably high crime rate plays a role in the
brain drain, taking into account the shortage of skill in South Africa, and
that crime also limits foreign investments and foreign capital that
contribute to South Africa’s economic development?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam  Speaker,  I  will  not  dignify  this  with  an
answer. I have said that the  crime  prevention  measures  are  overarching.
Whether there was Asgisa or not, we would have to do this  job,  because  it
is one of the basic services that we have to provide to  our  citizens.  So,
we do not have to repeat in Asgisa something that we  have  to  do  and  are
doing anyway. We just need to do it better. [Applause.]
Mnu V  B  NDLOVU:  Somlomo,  mhlonishwa  Phini  likaMongameli,  uma  kuthiwa
ukufakwa  kwezimboni  kungase  kuncishiswe  ngukuthi  mhlawumbe   ubugebengu
bandile  ezweni,  ngabe  umhlonishwa  uyakuvuma  yini   lokho   ngoba   mina
bengicabanga  ukuthi   phela   ukusebenza   kwezokuphepha   kufanele   ngabe
kuyithinta yonke iMinyango? Manje  indlela  ababuza  ngayo  laba  bafowethu,
kuzwakala sengathi umhlonishwa uyakuvuma ukuthi ubugebengu  lobu  obenziwayo
ezweni bukhulile. Uma ekuvuma ethi  bukhulile,  lokho  akuzukuyithinta  yini
imicabango yalaba abafuna ukufaka izimboni kuleli zwe?  Uma  ngabe  kuvunywa
uwena mhlonishwa, ngeke kusuke kubakhinyabeze yini na?

IPHINI LIKAMONGAMELI: Konje oNdlovu bangoGatsheni, oBoya benyathi?

AMALUNGU AHLONIPHEKILE: Yebo!

IPHINI  LIKAMONGAMELI:  Ngiyezwa.  Angizange   ngisho   ukuthi   ngiyazivuna
izigebengu.  UNgqongqoshe  ongasekho,   uMnu   Tshwete,   wayevame   ukuthi,
“Izigebengu zizoxakana nathi njengoba ithambo lixakana nenja.”  Nayo-ke  nje
into esifuna ukulwa nayo. Ukuthi le nto ifakwa ku-Asgisa noma  uyifaka  kwi-
JCPS,   lokho   sekuyimininingwane.   Into   ebalulekile   ukuthi   makuliwe
nobugebengu.

Maqondana  nombuzo  othi  ubugebengu  bunayo   yini   indlela   yokunciphisa
ukutshalwa kwezimali,  yizo  zonke  izinto  lezo  esiziqaphile.  Noma  ngabe
bekungenzeki lokho,  kubalulekile  ukuthi  ubugebengu  makuliwe  nabo  ngqo.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)
[Mr V B NDLOVU: Chairperson, hon Deputy President, when there is  talk  that
investments might decrease owing to the crime level which is too high,  does
the hon Deputy President agree with that, because personally, I  think  that
the question of safety should concern all departments?  And  the  way  these
brothers ask questions; it sounds like  the  Deputy  President  admits  that
crime has increased in this country. If the  Deputy  President  admits  that
crime is on the increase, is that not going to be a  matter  of  concern  to
those who want to invest in this country? If you, the hon Deputy  President,
admit this, is that not going to scare investors?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: By the way, the Ndlovus are also  known  as  Gatsheni,
Boya benyathi?

HON MEMBERS: Yes!

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: I understand. I have never  said  that  I  am  partial
towards criminals.  The  late  Minister,  Mr  Tshwete,  used  to  say:  ”The
criminals will fight us like a dog fighting for its  bone  because  we  give
them such a hard time.”  And that  is  the  thing  that  we  want  to  fight
against. Whether it is Asgisa or JCPS, is just a detail. The most  important
thing is to fight crime.

With regard to whether crime has an impact on decreasing investments,  those
are the things that we are looking at. Even if that was  not  happening,  it
is still important to fight crime head-on. [Applause.]]

Nksz M M SOTYU: Ndiyabulela Sekela Mongameli, uchan’ucwethe Mamlambo
njengokuba sele ubonisile ukubaluleka kwentsebenziswano phakathi koluntu
ngokubanzikunye norhulumente ngokulwisana nobundlobongela, uhambe emazwini
ebethethwa nguMongameli kwintetho yakhe yovulo lwePalamente ebonisa
ukubaluleka kodibana kwethu sisilwa nobu bundlobongela. Ngoko ke andizi
kubuza mbuzo kuwe. Ndiza kuthi nje kuwe, mazenethole! (Translation of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Mrs M M SOTYU: I thank you, Deputy President, you have hit the nail on the
right place, Mrs Mlambo. You have shown us why there should be co-operation
between communities and the government in crime prevention. This is exactly
what the President said in his speech during the opening of Parliament. I
am, therefore, not going to ask you any question other than to say, well
done!]

The  SPEAKER:  Phini  likaMongameli,  hhayi-ke  useyivalile.  [Well,  Deputy
President, there you are, she has closed it.]

                 Access to water, sanitation and electricity

3.    Mr A M Mpontshane (IFP) asked the Deputy President:

      Whether the Government has any programmes in place to meet its targets
      regarding access to water, sanitation and electricity?

                       N246E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Deputy Speaker, the answer to this question is
as follows: Government has set the following targets with regard to the
attainment of universal access to the basic services of water, sanitation
and electricity – for the eradication of the bucket system the deadline is
the end of 2007, for access to basic potable, clean water it is the end of
2008, for access to basic, decent sanitation it is the end of 2010, and for
access to basic electricity it is the end of 2012.

Cabinet received a full report at the Cabinet lekgotla last month, and
discussed the mechanisms put in place in order to meet these targets. In
the limited time allowed for me to answer these questions, let me just
detail some of the steps we are following to accelerate the provision of
these basic services and to meet the said targets.

Firstly, we have increased our transfer of funds to the local sphere of
government where these services are provided. Transfers to local government
have grown by 19% per year in the current 2007-08 Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework.

As hon members will recall, the Minister of Finance announced in his Budget
last week that the local government equitable share will receive a further
R5 billion for the delivery of free basic services, which has now reached
an average of about 80% of households. The municipal infrastructure grant
receives R400 million more for a final push to eradicate the bucket system;
a further R600 million for the electrification programme; R1,4 billion for
bulk water and sanitation infrastructure; and R950 million to deliver water
and electricity to schools and clinics. The total infrastructure transfers
to municipalities now total R52 billion over the next three years.

Secondly, in line with Project Consolidate, we are intensifying our efforts
to ensure that the expenditure level of the municipal infrastructure grant
improves significantly. The introduction of project and programme
management practices will enable a clear flow of information which will
ensure alignment of planning, funding and budget prioritisation.

We are also endeavouring to provide more support to municipalities with
critical capacity constraints and are particularly targeting municipalities
with limited or no capacity; rural municipalities with backlogs exceeding
60% of the population; those rural municipalities which are under Project
Consolidate; and rural municipalities that are spending less than 50% of
the municipal infrastructure grant allocation.
A major priority is schools and clinics that do not have basic services.
The government, through the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, will
assist struggling provinces and act as an implementing agent to provide
infrastructure to schools and clinics. Water boards and NGOs will be
utilised. Existing capacity within the provinces will be enhanced and
allocations for this programme will be ring-fenced.

Fourthly, we are endeavouring to ensure that more engineers are deployed to
these programmes by the Department of Provincial and Local Government, and
the Development Bank of Southern Africa. Specifically, we are aiming at
recruiting more engineers and targeting those that are retired in order to
solicit their expertise, and in some cases solicit the expertise of
engineers in our existing organs such as the Industrial Development
Corporation and the Development Bank of Southern Africa. Even the engineers
that are here in Parliament must go back and practise. We want engineers
turned bankers to go back to their profession, people such as the Minister
of Finance.

Lastly, the government, through the Department of Water Affairs and
Forestry, will be working more closely with identified municipalities to
ensure speedier implementation of water and sanitation projects. This will
include hands-on implementation of programmes and projects of other
government departments such as Water Affairs, and Provincial and Local
Government. Thank you.
Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Somlomo, siyabonga kumhlonishwa iPhini likaMongameli.
[Madam Speaker, we thank the hon Deputy President.]

Indeed, it is good that the government has these comprehensive programmes,
plans and targets that it wants to meet in providing water, electricity and
sanitation.

But one has to ask questions. If one looks at what is happening in the
rural areas, women, of course, and some men, still have to travel many
kilometres from distributing centres because piped water does not go to
their households. They still stand in these long queues. Does the
government envisage bringing piped water closer to their households?

Secondly, we appreciate the fact that the government is doing something
about the bucket system. But, of course, in the rural areas there are those
who do not have the relative luxury of those buckets; all they have is the
bush. Will the government also include those who don’t have this bucket
system, who have the bush instead?

Lastly, a specific question to the Deputy President: I come from the area
where we have the vast Jozini Dam, but around the area ...

The SPEAKER: Hon member, you have exhausted your minute and you are still
telling the history of where you come from. You have not yet asked your
question. [Laughter.]
Mnu A M MPONTSHANE: Bengithi ngizama ukwendlalela, Somlomo.

USOMLOMO: Musa ukwendlala mfowethu, asikho isikhathi sokwendlala. [Uhleko.]

Mnu A M MPONTSHANE: Awungiphe umzuzwana omncane nje ... [Ubuwelewele.]
Ngicela ukubuza-ke mhlonishwa Phini likaMongameli ukuthi laphayana edamini
laseJozini ... (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A M MPONTSHANE: I was trying to give a background, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: Stop giving a background, my brother, there is no time for a
background.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Just give me a second ... [Interjections.] May I then
ask the hon Deputy President regarding the Jozini Dam ...]

... are there any concrete plans to use that dam to supply water to the
surrounding communities who have no water at all, as I am speaking to you?
Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Speaker, firstly, regarding places where there is no
tap in the house, when we talk about universal access the plan is that
people should not have to travel more than 200 metres to access clean,
potable water. Even before I get to that, you used to be in the KwaZulu-
Natal government: What did you do? [Laughter.] [Applause.] [Interjections.]
Madam Speaker, who is on the floor, they or I?

The SPEAKER: The Deputy President is on the floor. Can she answer?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Ndiyabulelagiyabonga. Nenza ntoni ngeJozini Dam? [I
thank you. What are you doing about the Jozini Dam?]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: May I give an
explanation ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Cha! Iyiphi leyo nto ofuna iqondiswe? Uyakuphendula nje uPhini
likaMongameli; – angithi ubumbuze umbuzo? [No! What is it that you want to
correct? The Deputy President has answered you. Have you not asked her a
question?]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, I would like to explain.

The SPEAKER: Cha, bab’uMpontshane. Ngicela uhlale phansi khona
ezokuphendula umhlonishwa uPhini likaMongameli. [No, hon Mpontshane. I am
asking you to take your seat so that the hon Deputy President can respond
to your question.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: No, No. I have the explanation. You lost the
elections there. That is what happened, because you did not give people
water quickly enough. But I am helping you now.

I have answered the part of the question on what we are defining as
universal access. In addition, when we talk about universal access to
sanitation by 2008, we are including those communities which do not have
sanitation facilities now, so the new households that are being built and
the ones which have no sanitation facilities at all will therefore be
included in the new figure.

Of course, one of the things we are most anxious about is to make sure that
new houses and facilities that are being built have all these basic
services. We must not, as we go forward, create a new backlog of inadequate
human settlements. In that way, hopefully, we will reduce the backlog
significantly. Thank you.

Mr W P DOMAN: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, you referred to the
important role that local government will have to play in this regard. Now,
the sector skills plan findings for local government indicate that 36% to
38% of approved positions in local government are vacant. The highest
proportion of these vacant posts is in less skilled positions - elementary
and clerical workers. So, the shortage is not attributable to skills
scarcity. They also found that at least 20 000 to 30 000 jobs could be
created immediately if they would just appoint these people.
So, hon Deputy President, I would like to ask you: Does the government have
any plans or initiatives to ensure that the local government appoints these
people, and can you exert any pressure on an organisation such as the ANC,
which has 80% of the executive managers that can do this job?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Yes, hon member, it is our intention to do all we can
to try to fill the vacancies as soon as possible, especially at municipal
level, starting with the City of Cape Town, if possible. [Interjections.]
Everybody wants to come and work in Cape Town. [Interjections.] No! They
just want to come and live in Cape Town, not to live under the present
government that is governing the City of Cape Town but just to live in Cape
Town for its God-given beauty. [Interjections.]

In general, hon members, part of the work that we are doing in the
deployment of unemployed graduates is to meet these municipalities where
there is a genuine problem in recruiting people. For instance, where we
have vacancies for clerks, that work ends up being done by teachers and
therefore takes up valuable teaching time. The Minister of Education
collaborates with the Minister of Public Works to make sure that when we
recruit people for the Extended Public Works Programme, we recruit people
who have recorded skills or are trainable and could play a role in
providing those administrative services, we will use those people to fill
those positions. We will train them so that they become fully qualified
clerks.
In fact, hon member, the Minister for the Public Service and Administration
and I have this as one of our key activities to embark upon, at least in
the first half of the year. I think the challenge is in the public sector.
But we would also like the private sector to be a bit more aggressive about
how they recruit so as to create these many instant jobs you and I are
looking for.

Mr J D ARENDSE: Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the Deputy President
whether the programme to eradicate the bucket system is flexible enough to
incorporate formal areas that do not use the bucket system, and also do not
use any type of formal sanitation system but, instead, make use of a system
commonly known as the long-drop pit latrine, which is dug by the people
themselves? I am speaking about areas where a house is built with brick and
mortar, which is obviously a formal house, but where people still dig their
own latrine in the yard. They don’t use the bucket system so at the moment
they don’t qualify for assistance. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, it is not in the target we have for
universal access by 2008, but it is included in the improvements. And, hon
member, it’s not unparliamentary to talk about droppings in Parliament.
[Laughter.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I would like to know if the Deputy President
is satisfied with the progress in terms of sanitation, water and
electricity with regard to schools? Are some provinces perhaps lagging
behind in this respect? I say this with a picture in mind of some of the
rural Eastern Cape schools I visited. Has the government prioritised these
rural schools, and schools in general?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Yes, hon member, regarding those areas where the
services are most needed and where the capacity in the province seems most
stressed, we are prioritising them for support. But, as you know, with
these kinds of services, in the case of schools, it’s either a service or
no service at all. We would like to see all the schools as priorities. But,
where there is clearly a problem, that the province is going to default
because there is no capacity, we try to help those provinces. That is why,
in Project Consolidate, we even deploy those experts from stronger
municipalities to go there as facilitators for faster implementation.

        Public servant involvement in the Moral Regeneration Movement

4.    Ms P R Mashangoane (ANC) asked the Deputy President:

      What steps will the government take to ensure that public servants, in
      particular those in the main service delivery departments, are
      involved in the implementation of the key principles of the Moral
      Regeneration Movement?                  N248E

Ms P R MASHANGOANE: Thank you, Madam Speaker ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! It’s the Deputy President who must respond to the
question, hon member.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: The hon member is in a hurry to get an answer, Madam
Speaker.

Hon members are aware that the Moral Regeneration Movement is a joint
initiative between civil society and government at national, provincial and
local levels. As far as national government is concerned, some departments
are running programmes aimed at strengthening the moral fibre of our
society, but also at strengthening themselves within the departments.
However, I do believe that much more can be done and more departments can
participate in this programme.

Your question, hon member, relates to what government is doing to ensure
that its employees, the public servants, are imbued with the principles and
values of moral regeneration. I think that this is a crucial question,
because if we were succeeding to the extent that we want to succeed in this
regard, we would not be talking about corruption or poor service delivery
in pockets of our civil society. That is why we, therefore, need to have
targeted and dedicated programmes to address these challenges.

We are also aware that, in the Public Service, we have adopted the Batho
Pele principles. We speak directly to the issue of morality. The Department
of Public Service and Administration has programmes on Batho Pele, which
have the potential to strengthen the moral values of public servants, and
we expect departments to provide reports on what they are doing or planning
to do to instil these values within their departments and amongst their
employees. This is also expected to happen within the overall compliance
and requirements of Batho Pele. We will be in a position to give more
detailed feedback to this House once the Minister for the Public Service
and Administration has received progress reports from departments.

Hon members, the most critical intervention that, I would like to argue,
needs to be made in strengthening the moral fibre of our society is within
families; it is by parents and communities because it is here that we plant
the seeds of positive values amongst our young people. The responsibility
should not only be shifted to schools, the government and organised civil
society. It is particularly families that need to instil moral values,
starting from childhood. So, we need parents to be a critical component of
the Moral Regeneration Movement.

I’d like to take this opportunity to urge not just parents and families and
those who are in care of young people and children, but also the hon
members to play a role in advancing moral regeneration in their
constituencies and to support the initiatives that are undertaken in their
communities by different stakeholders, church groups, youth groups,
education and so on, so that we can have a comprehensive approach.
[Applause.]

Ms P R MASHANGOANE: Madam Speaker, I was indeed really in a hurry to get a
response from the Deputy President. [Laughter.] Thank you, Deputy
President, for your comprehensive response. My follow-up question is: Apart
from reports from departments, what mechanisms are in place to monitor
change in behaviour towards adherence to the principles and objectives of
the Moral Regeneration Movement?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, this question is extremely difficult:
What mechanisms are in place to monitor change in social behaviour? I must
say I have to go and investigate this; I don’t know the answer. [Laughter.]
Is it a number of sinners or of those who go to heaven? Of course, the
overall decrease in criminal behaviour would be an important indicator.

I would like to ask Minister Pallo Jordan to answer this question on my
behalf in the next round of questions. [Applause.]

Mr I F JULIES: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, in the Public Service there
is a code of conduct for public servants. When will the government
implement the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, No 12 of
2004? For example, when will the government act against Members of
Parliament who are involved in the Travelgate scandal?
The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, I think Parliament should be able to
speak for itself on this matter. So, I think the hon member should direct
this question to Parliament.

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, arising from your
response, the ACDP shares your view that a high standard of ethics and
morality is required, particularly in the Public Service, as well as your
emphasis on the role that families should play. However, in terms of the
Public Service Code as well as the Protected Disclosures Act, public
servants are required to report fraud, corruption, nepotism,
maladministration and other offences in both state and private sectors. To
what degree, hon Deputy President, are the provisions of the Protected
Disclosures Act, which protect whistle-blowers, being circulated in the
Public Service to make public servants aware of the statutory protection
they enjoy so that they can contribute to ethical standards that are being
maintained in the Public Service?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon member, I am not aware that the civil servants
generally do not know that they are protected and that the mechanisms and
the methods used for people to whistle-blow are such that people can
actually do that in confidence in order to protect themselves. Those of us
who are principals have the responsibility, when we pursue these matters,
not to disclose the sources of this information where we think it will
endanger people. But more and more we find that public servants actually
want to disclose and they want to take the responsibility for having made
the disclosure, because I think there is a growing sense that it is a good
thing to actually report wrongdoing. But to the extent that in some cases,
especially junior officials, may need protection, clearly that is in place.
If it is the sense of the member that perhaps people do not know, maybe
this is something that we need to look at. But I wasn’t aware that this is
a problem.

I also want to go back to the question that I didn’t answer, regarding some
of the key indicators to monitor the impact of moral regeneration. I think
some of the more formal instruments that we have will include the PMFA,
through which we are able to identify problems; and the performance
management agreements that people have to sign and against which they have
to perform and be evaluated. Corporate governance in general is also but
one of the mechanisms that we have to measure that impact.

When we see an increase of people who comply with all these measures, we
will know that we are actually having a breakthrough. When we see an
increase in incidents, we will know that we are not performing according to
our own objectives. However, when you see a decrease of people who default,
then, obviously, we are able to make a judgment based on that.

Maybe you will see these as hard instruments. So, we also are concerned
about having both the hard instruments and also monitoring the soft issues,
because, concerning some of the issues around customer care, not all of the
instruments that we have can actually indicate to you whether a person
gives a service with a smile, which in some cases can be make or break in
the manner in which people are made to feel welcome. So, those are some of
the things that we continuously have to fine-tune. These are the things
that those who are in the front line of service provision need to actually
internalise. When we do orientation and ongoing training for our public
servants, these are some of the things that we need to look at. Thank you.

Mnu V B NDLOVU: Somlomo, mhlonishwa Phini likaMongameli, kuye kwenziwe
njani ngalaba abanamakhanda alukhuni kodwa futhi bevikelwe yizinyonyana
zabo noma mhlawumbe bevikelwe ukuthi banezikhundla ezinkulu – kodwa kube

IPHINI LIKAMONGAMELI: Abanye babo basejele njengoba sikhuluma nje ...
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, what is usually done
about those who are hard-headed and yet they are protected by their unions
and sometimes they are also protected by the high positions that they
occupy and yet things must be reported to them? What should be done about
those who are hard-headed who do not want to follow the principles of moral
regeneration?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Some of them are languishing in jails as we speak
...]

... because the application of laws and regulations and the requirements,
when it comes to compliance, applies to everybody. If you are a director-
general, for instance, you have the same sets of conditions when it comes
into aspects of compliance as somebody who is junior and so on. So, I think
the important thing is to apply the regulations and the laws without fear
and favour.

                                 (Cluster 1)

MINISTERS:

              Community policing forums in fight against crime

5.    Mr M S Moatshe (ANC) asked the Minister of Safety and Security:

      Whether his department is looking at strengthening community policing
      forums (CPFs) in order to make them more effective as an important
      partner of the Government in the fight against crime; if not, what is
      the position in this regard; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                              N207E

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, the answer is yes, the
community policing forums are the best vehicle to connect communities with
the police, as an expression of the concept of community policing. Put at
the centre of that relationship, the CPFs will be given the necessary
authority to build and nurture that community–police relationship. We are,
therefore, putting in place measures to make the CPFs autonomous bodies
that will be responsible to the communities, to mediate between them and
the police.

The CPFs will be established through a democratic process, including
elections. The functions of the revamped CPFs will include building
confidence between the communities and the police, helping to root the
police among the people as trusted allies in the fight against crime,
determining, together with the police, policing priorities in the given
community and assessing police performance on the basis of those
priorities.

The CPFs will be resourced by the government and members will receive
training for better management and effective communication with all
stakeholders. Thank you.

Mr M S MOATSHE: Thank you, Minister, for your comprehensive answer. Will
you please indicate to this House what the likely impact is that the
Minister expects as a result of these measures aimed at the strengthening
of CPFs? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: There will, of course, be an
improvement in terms of policing in all the areas where there will be these
structures. Given the fact that we have always recognised that when you
have better community-police relations, then crime in those areas does
decrease. We are certain, therefore, that there will be very drastic
reductions in crime in those areas.

We have already started a programme where some of the communities are
already working with the police, and in those areas crime has indeed gone
down. That is the impact that we will have. But more than that, we will
have better co-ordination of all the resources that will be deployed in
these given areas, and conditions will be created for engaging more people,
on the basis of poverty alleviation, who will work side by side with the
police as reservists. We believe, therefore, that when we do this, which,
by the way, is an accepted practice in most democracies, we will indeed be
impacting very positively on the fight against crime. Thank you.

Mr C M MORKEL: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Minister, CPFs are based in
geographical communities, but we have also seen recently the roll-out of
the railway police on certain routes. Do you see an opportunity to extend
the type of role communities play in geographical police areas on those
routes in overseeing the railway police, especially regular commuters that
would perhaps be part of a mobile CPF or become reservists that travel
regularly on that route? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: That also fits into the design that we
have, because, in the end, we are going to have community police forums in
all areas that are therefore going to work with the police, among other
things, to identify people within those communities that can become part of
the reservist system.

An arrangement can be made under the command and control of the CPFs for
them to have a relationship with other areas where there will be CPFs, so
that the reservists become part and parcel of railway policing. In other
words, you will have people who, together with the police, will be at the
railway stations and will be on the trains themselves.

We don’t want to create many structures for this. The CPFs can do that kind
of work. It is correct that that would also benefit from the revamped
community police forums, because those are intended indeed to encourage
better community-police relations. Thank you.

Mnr R J KING: Agb Minister, die President beklemtoon in die staatsrede die
noodsaaklikheid van vennootskappe in samewerking oor staat en gemeenskappe
heen ten einde misdaad te beveg. Die President voorsien die uitbouing van
die Gemeenskapspolisiëringsforums tot geïntegreerde
gemeenskapsveiligheidsentrums.

Onmiddellik kom dit by ’n mens op, ’n wonderlike ideaal, mits u departement
nie hierdeur probeer wegskram van die verantwoordelikheid vir die werwing,
opleiding, finansiële ondersteuning, uitbouing, bevordering en erkenning
nie. Is u bereid om die volle verantwoordelikheid vorentoe te aanvaar dat
Gemeenskapspolisiëringsforums sal werk? (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr R J King: Hon Minister, in his state of the nation address the
President emphasised the need for partnerships to co-operate across state
and community lines in order to fight crime. The President envisages the
extension of community police forums into integrated community safety
centres.

What immediately comes to mind is that it is a wonderful ideal, provided
that your department does not in this manner try to avoid the
responsibility of recruitment, training, financial support, extension,
promotion and acknowledgement. Are you prepared to accept full
responsibility in future for the success of community police forums?]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: As you know, I can speak Afrikaans,
but I wanted to be certain that the interpretation is correct upstairs. Of
course, this is not an abdication of our responsibilities. We have made
this abundantly clear from the outset. All that is happening is that we are
inviting the communities to participate in providing national security
everywhere in South Africa and, as I say, this is not a practice that is
unique only to South Africa. It happens elsewhere in the world as well, but
the law-enforcement agencies don’t abdicate their responsibility; they will
be leading from the front in respect to these matters.

It is better to work together with the people, particularly because the
criminals that we are fighting live among the people, and, therefore, the
people are the best repository for information - the very information we
require in order for us to conduct investigations successfully. We are not
abdicating our responsibility.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker, Minister, in my constituency all the
smaller organisations got together and formed a community police forum
where each home in the Havenside area is paying R150 per home and we have
24-hour police security. We bought bicycles and four-wheel scooters for
them to use.

I am happy to hear that we can get some assistance from your department.
Can you please kindly let me know who we can contact to get some sort of
assistance? Thank you very much.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: It is those experiences of our people
that in fact have informed what we are trying to do. Over many years now
there have been communities indeed that have collected some resources in
order for them to ensure that there is some community activity that is
designed to assist the law-enforcement agencies.

As I said in my speech the other day in this House, there are even some
members, like you, who participate in those programmes. What we are saying
is that we must create conditions, and those can only be made possible as a
consequence of decisions that we must take here, because we must change the
law in order for us to do all these things. It does not mean that when you
have started something like that you can’t approach, for instance, your
local station commander. You go to that person, the commissioner there, and
speak with him or her.

I am sure the police will be able to help, but I really appreciate the role
that people, like some of these hon members in this House, are playing.
Fortunately, you do understand that when we make the kind of call we have
made, it is not because we ourselves want to walk away from our
responsibility. Thank you very much for that.

         Release of crime statistics and targets for crime reduction

20.   Ms D Kohler-Barnard (DA) asked the Minister of Safety and Security:



      (1)   Whether he will release crime statistics to the public and the
           legislatures so that his department’s performance can be
           properly assessed; if not, why not; if so, when;




      (2)   whether he will outline a set of targets for crime reduction, by
           category; if not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details;




      (3)   whether he will step down if he fails to achieve these targets;
           if not, why not;


      (4)   what is the government’s position on transparency, with specific
           reference to his department’s refusal to release up-to-date
           crime statistics?                                        N225E

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: It is our department’s policy to
release crime statistics annually for all levels of policing before the end
of September of the financial year, following the year of release. The last
crime statistics, therefore, were released in September last year as part
of the SA Police Service’s annual report.

This department’s performance is assessed against quarterly reports to the
National Treasury. The targets set for crime reduction are already a common
cause. To repeat, the police are expected to reduce serious and violent
crimes by between 7% and 10% annually until 2014. Those serious and violent
crimes include murder, attempted murder, rape, indecent assault, assault,
serious assault and common assault, aggravated robbery and common robbery.
While no target has been set for the other categories of crime, the
reduction of crime is part of the mandate of SAPS to prevent and combat
crime. To that extent, therefore, the police are determined to reduce the
levels of all crime, as has been happening since 1995, when the SAPS was
established.

There’s a question about stepping down and I want to say that I’ve
responded to that question in the past, hon member, and I’m not going to
repeat myself. I’m inviting you, therefore, hon member, to go to Hansard
and that’s where you’ll get the answer.

The hon member knows that we are transparent. We publish an annual report
on the activities of the SAPS, including crime prevention and crime-
combating activities. And statistics are part and parcel of that report.
That is being transparent. There are many countries in the world that
embraced democracy much earlier than we did but which do not publish
statistics.

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Minister, you told me in an answer to a parliamentary
question last year that you would present your annual crime statistics to
Parliament before releasing them to the press. You stated that you would,
but you then chose not to. In fact, these figures are never even presented
to the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security to assist us in our
oversight duties. You stated that you would bring them to Parliament first
– you didn’t. Will you reconsider, and, at the very least, bring them to
the portfolio committee before your annual bun fight?

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I hope  that  you
are going to indicate to her that the first thing we do indeed is to  submit
those reports to Parliament. By the time we interact with the  media,  those
reports have been submitted  to  Parliament.  I  don’t  know  what  you  are
referring to when you say we have not submitted them  to  Parliament  before
we released them to the media - because we did.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The hon House Chair, will you please  help  us  maintain
order in your corner there.

Mnu  V  B  NDLOVU:  Ngiyabonga,   Phini   likaSomlomo.   Bengithi   angibuze

[Mr V B NDLOVU: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I wanted to ask the hon  Minister
whether the plan ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Speak into the microphone so that we can hear you.

Mr V B NDLOVU: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I wanted to ask the  hon  Minister
whether the plan that we previously used of integrating all the  departments
in fighting crime could be brought back so that it  does  not  only  end  up
being the Department of Safety and Security that deals with this problem  as
there are criminals from other departments too.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: I don’t know what he means by that.

Eqinisweni,  yilo  Mnyango  obhekene  nezigebengu.  [In  fact,  it  is  this
department that deals with criminals.]

But, as you’d appreciate, we do work in clusters and our cluster  is  a  big
one. All the people in  that  cluster  are  working  on  the  basis  of  the
integrated criminal justice system.

IPHINI  LIKASOMLOMO:  Sengihlulekie  ukukusiza  baba  ngoba  kade  ngikucela
ngithi  khuluma  ngendlela  yokuthi  ngikwazi  ukukuzwa   kodwa   wena   ube

impendulo. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I have failed to assist  you,  hon  member,  because  I
have requested you several times to speak audibly so that I  can  hear  you,
but you continue to speak softly. Anyway, I just  hope  that  you  got  your
reply.]

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Minister, I would like to put it to you that, in  fact,
you did not submit them to Parliament. We checked extensively on the day  of
your press conference. There was nothing available at all to anyone  asking.
So, I don’t know where you released them or to whom, but  it  certainly  was
not to Parliament.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: I don’t know if we are  going  to  have
this kind of argument with the hon member. The fact of the  matter  is  that
we would never ever go to anyone else and release a report we  know  has  to
be submitted to Parliament first of all. We did that and whatever you did  -
I mean you have your own structures and I  have  mine.  You  have  your  own
means of verifying things and I have my own. I’m saying and I am putting  it
to you that we  submitted  that  report  before  we  went  public  with  it.
[Interjections.]

        Safekeeping and control of police dockets at police stations

30.   Mr V B Ndlovu (IFP) asked the Minister of Safety and Security:


      Whether any steps are being taken to improve the (a) controls over and
      (b) safekeeping of police dockets at police stations; if not, why not;
      if so, what steps?                                       N236E

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Deputy Speaker, the answer to
both questions is yes. The following are the steps we have taken: Firstly,
there are lockable facilities that have been issued to the detective
service component for the secure storage of dockets in order to prevent
losses and unauthorised access to such dockets. Instructions to keep
offices of investigating officers locked during their absence have been
issued to prevent unauthorised access to dockets and/or theft thereof.

Dockets forwarded to and received from court are audited to prevent losses
that may arise. Strong departmental action is taken against members who are
found to have negligently lost dockets. All docket losses are monitored by
the head office by means of a monthly return from the provinces. Thank you.

Mnu V B NDLOVU: Phini likaSomlomo, mhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe, umqondosimo
walo mbuzo ubuqonde ukubuza ukuthi uma selilahlekile idokodo, kwenzekani
kumnikazi wedokodo? Uma lilahlekile idokodo kube kukhona ophakathi,
oboshiwe, kwenzeka njani kuyena? Uma lidayisiwe, lowo olidayisile kwenziwa
njani ngaye? Lo olithengile yena-ke wenziwa njani?

Le mibuzo ngiyibuza ngoba, ekugcineni, kuye kube sengathi yilaba
abaphenyayo kuphela abanecala kanti mhlawumbe baningi abant u abathintekayo
ekulahlekeni nasekwebiweni kwamadokodo. Kuye kwenzeke njani kulaba bantu
abayimixhantela ekwenzeni lo mkhuba omubi kangaka? (Translation of isiZulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr V B NDLOVU: Deputy Madam Speaker, hon Minister, the core of this
question was to ask what happens when the docket is lost. What happens to
the owner of the docket? When the docket is lost and there is an accused
person who is languishing in jail, what happens to him? If the docket has
been sold, what happens to the person who sold it? And what happens to the
one who bought it?

I am asking these questions because, at the end of the day, it always looks
like it is only the detectives who are guilty whereas in fact there are
many other people who are involved in the disappearance of dockets. What
happens to these other people who are involved in this bad practice?]

UMPHATHISWA WEZOKHUSELO NOKHUSELEKO: Xa kuphandwa, kuphandwa umntu lo

wena bayalithenga idokethi, nabo bayaphandwa.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: When an investigation is conducted,
it is into the official who handled the docket, together with everybody who
has been found to have been involved. This includes those that you claim
buy the docket.]

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Minister, in this technological age, no copy is made
of dockets as they are completed. Now, the single piece of paper that
represents a victim’s right to justice then becomes a second victim.
Firstly, it might become a victim of shoddy filing, or shoddy police work,
and never to be found again. Secondly, and more commonly, it becomes a
secondary victim for the perpetrator.
While it is unforgivable for a member of the SA Police Service to lose a
docket, it is equally so that certain members are corrupt and will dispose
of a docket in exchange for money. Have the members of the SAPS been
trained to detect and report such corruption within their ranks, and if
they have, why is it still happening?

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: It is true that it is still happening
and, I must indicate, not to the same degree and level as was the case in
the past. There are measures that are in place to deal with this matter. It
is not only just a matter of people who lose dockets or what-have-you. That
situation is very serious. It is criminal, in fact, for any person who is
conducting an investigation to lose any aspect of that investigation,
including whatever information is available as well as information in the
dockets themselves.

This is a matter that we are addressing on an ongoing basis. Quite soon our
systems are going to be such that it is not going to be possible for people
to sell any dockets, because - I am sure many members are aware now - we
are converting very rapidly to high technology in order to deal with all
these matters. Thank you.

Mr S MAHOTE: Deputy Speaker, Minister, will the department under your
guidance give due consideration to the electronic backup of dockets?

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Yes, we do, and we have even gone one
step further. The other day, the members of the Portfolio Committee on
Safety and Security were shown what the police as a management and
performance tool defines. What we have been able to do with regard to that
is that we are recalling a number of dockets that were closed as
undetected, and we are reopening those dockets in order for us to restart
investigations in a proper way. What we are doing is that, using that
instrument, the dockets are now being electronically stored so that we can
deal with matters, including this issue of where some of the dockets are
lost. Thank you.

Nksz N M MDAKA: Mphathiswa obekekileyo, inyaniso yinyaniso, ngoba xa

(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Mrs N M MDAKA: Hon Minister, the truth is the truth. Your department has
been able to rearrest a dangerous prisoner who had escaped from prison. We
are not going to discourage and discredit you when your department is doing
a good job. Our purpose is to build a nation. We are not, because we are an
opposition party, objecting to the good things just for the sake of
opposing. The truth must always remain the truth. For now, your department
is doing a sterling job. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is not a question, but a compliment. I don’t know
whether ...

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Hayi nam ndifuna nje ukuthi
ndiyabulela. Halala! [I also want to say thank you.]

                Shortage of artisans in Correctional Services

3.    Mr D V Bloem (ANC) asked the Minister of Correctional Services:

      Whether he has been informed of the shortage of artisans in
      Correctional Services workshops nationally; if so, (a) what has his
      department done to attract and retain artisans and (b) what measures
      have been put in place to review the current remuneration packages of
      artisans?                                    N205E

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Hon Deputy Speaker, in reply to the
question by the chairperson of the portfolio committee, the Department of
Correctional Services does have a vacancy rate of 6,5% in the specialised
field of artisans.

However, the artisan field in Correctional Services – we’re talking about
plumbers, fitters, motor mechanics and electricians here – is very broad,
and the department is not experiencing shortages in all fields. Each vacant
post is, therefore, dealt with on merit, in order to ensure the effective
functioning of that specific trade.

The prepared reply goes as follows:


   (a)      The department has advertised 102 artisan posts since September
        2006. Higher salaries have also been offered to artisans where a
        critical shortage exists. It’s not an easy task to retain artisans,
        due to the high demand and very high salaries in the broad labour
        market, which government departments cannot compete with. However,
        the department has resorted to making counter-offers in an effort to
        retain their services.

     b) The position of artisan, as with other scarce-skills occupational
        classes, has been revised and a new code of remuneration has been
        developed to cater for the specific needs of artisans. However, the
        impact of the high salaries and the different working conditions,
        which are also difficult within Correctional Services and in the
        labour market, is not only being felt with regard to artisans, and,
        therefore, the department is addressing all these scarce-skills
        occupational classes within the available budgetary allocations and
        the Department of Public Service and Administration mandates. Other
        initiatives, such as bonus incentives and payments for trade tests
        are also being considered under the department’s recruitment and
        retention strategy.


Thank you.

Mnr D V BLOEM: Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, baie dankie aan die Minister vir
die inligting wat u vandag vir ons gegee het.

Ek dink hierdie storie moet baie dringend ondersoek word. Die Witskrif vir
Korrektiewe Dienste lê spesifiek klem op rehabilitasie, maar ons sit met ’n
probleem. Ons het byvoorbeeld verlede maand Drakenstein besoek. Daar’s ook
’n tekort. In St Albans is daar ’n werkswinkel wat toe staan. Ek dink ons
moet ernstig aandag gee aan hierdie probleem om rehabilitasie ’n
werklikheid te maak, anders gaan ons met ’n groter probleem sit van mense
wat nie gerehabiliteer word nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr D V Bloem: Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you very much to the Minister
for the information you imparted here today.

I think this story should be investigated as a matter of urgency. The White
Paper on Correctional Services specifically puts the emphasis on
rehabilitation, but we are faced with a problem. For example, we visited
Drakenstein last month. There is also a shortage. In St Albans there is a
workshop that is not in use. I think we should give serious attention to
this problem in order to make rehabilitation a reality, otherwise we will
be faced with the much bigger problem of people not being rehabilitated.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: I do agree with you fully that this
must be addressed quite soon, and you’re quite correct as well that the
emphasis of Correctional Services is on rehabilitation, and when these
workshops are short of artisans it makes life very difficult. But, as you
well know, there are other programmes as well in which offenders can
participate.

Whilst we are busy dealing with that, one of the requirements I’m pushing
to make within Correctional Services is that offenders must participate in
at least four programmes before they are even given a chance to go to the
Parole Board. It is one of those things that we’ll be able to gauge them
with. There is agriculture, there are the workshops, there are lots of
other programmes that we have.

In Drakenstein we have a huge agricultural farm – some of them participate
in those – and in St Albans we also have huge workshops which I’m trying to
address very quickly. We will give, and are giving, serious attention to
all these issues. Thank you.

Mr J SELFE: Deputy Speaker, the hon Bloem is absolutely correct. On a visit
to Malmesbury Correctional Centre in June last year I observed four
workshops that could have been used to rehabilitate inmates standing
completely empty, and the reason for them standing empty was that the
artisans who used to train the inmates had all left the service. Apparently
some six to eight officials leave that facility every month, mainly to go
and run prisons in New Zealand.

Now, what steps is the Minister taking to stop our people from leaving to
go and run prisons in New Zealand, and what steps is the Minister taking to
employ artisans as part of an outreach or partnership with other
institutions in the private sector to fill these gaps on a temporary basis?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Hon member, as I have mentioned,
you’ll find that in areas such as Malmesbury, and other areas,  there’s
been a problem of vacancies not being funded, but those are things that I’m
addressing now to try and get those vacancies to be funded so that we can
retain some of those artisans.

But we also want to decentralise our advertising of vacancies. For a long
time they’ve been done at national level, but now we’re giving them to the
regions to look at so that they can address those issues very quickly
within their own management areas.

Artisans do leave, as I’ve mentioned here, because they get better offers.
We have also said that we were going to increase our counter-offers to them
so that they don’t leave. If there are departments that have these
artisans, we’ll work with them so that they can do some shifts with us and
some shifts with them. These are things that we are addressing at the
moment. Thank you.

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Deputy Speaker, I concur with my colleagues that
there’s a serious problem here and it’s something that does need to be
sorted out. I’ve been partly covered by the questions posed by my
colleagues, but a further question is: We have talked for many years now
about an income-producing facility. In other words, we’re saying that most
of these artisans are working in situations where they could be producing
an income for the department which could be used towards the salaries of
these people.

The question that I also pose is: Are these artisans tutors or are they
merely artisans? There’s a difference between somebody who is an artisan
and somebody who is capable of teaching, and I think we need to address
that issue as well and perhaps look at the salaries that should be paid for
that particular qualification. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Hon member, remember that I have
said that we are trying to address these together with Treasury and with
the Department of Public Service and Administration. I’ll tell you why I
said Treasury; because we do produce some of the stuff in the workshops,
and it’s quite beautiful stuff that offenders produce, but we cannot just
sell it on the open market. [Interjections.] He has his Constitution,
looking at me. I’ve been pleading with them that some of the money that we
get ... Quite rightly, Treasury says we should give it to them.
[Interjections.] Exactly! It goes back. So I’m trying to ask if we can’t
retain that so that we can increase the salaries of these artisans.

There is a difference – you are right – between tutors and artisans. We
still have the tutors as well, and we’re battling in that regard too, but
the more pressure we can put on Treasury, and a little bit of pressure on
Labour, because Labour also ... [Interjections.] I’ll sit on you!
[Laughter.] I will sit on you. I’m bigger than you!

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: It’s unparliamentary to sit on any hon member!

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Sorry, sorry, Chair. That threat is
unparliamentary. I will not sit on him. [Interjections.] No, I won’t do
that.

Also, some of the salaries are kept by Public Service and Administration.
That’s another problem that we are facing. We are trying to plead with the
DPSA not to cap the salaries, because we’re losing people in the process.
Let’s try and use whatever funding we have to make sure that we retain
them. We’re going to be working very hard towards that.
Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, you’re out of order!

Mnr D V BLOEM: Minister, baie dankie, ek is doodseker die lede daar buite
wat vandag na u antwoord geluister het, gaan harder werk, want hulle weet u
het gepraat met die Minister van Finansies en dat hierdie mense nou hier in
Suid-Afrika gaan bly en beter werk doen. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die vraag is
nou, wanneer gaan u met die Minister van Finansies praat? [Gelag.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr D V Bloem: Minister, thank you, I am absolutely certain that the
members out there who have listened to your reply today are going to work
harder, because they know that you have spoken to the Minister of Finance
and that those people will be remaining in South Africa and will be
improving their efforts.[Interjections.] The question remains, when are you
going to speak to the Minister of Finance? [Laughter.]]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: As long as there’s nothing like sitting on an hon
member! [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chair, I did apologise for that.

Ek is ook doodseker ... [I am also very sure] ... that we will try our best
to address some of these issues. However, I’m also making a call to
artisans who are retired and are out there – plumbers and other people, and
even amongst the offenders we do have some of these artisans – to come
forward so that we can give them some work to do so as to help the others
to gain these skills. I’m making that call, but I’m making that call also
to offenders, because we have plumbers who are offenders and they do work
within our facilities and we do pay them a certain stipend.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, Minister. We are very happy today to hear
that the Minister is very tweetalig [bilingual], but to use the two
languages in one sentence takes some doing. Excellent! Very good.

 Escapes from prison, method of escape, escapees assisted by police officers
                              and prosecutions

26.   Rev K R J Meshoe (ACDP) asked the Minister of Safety and Security:



      (1)   (a) How many persons have escaped from prisons and holding cells
            during the most recent 12-month period for which information is
            available and (b) what was the method of operation used by each
            escapee;

      (2)   whether there were any cases where police officers assisted
            prisoners who escaped; if so, what are the relevant details;


      (3)   whether any police officers have been prosecuted as a result; if
            not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                                              N231E

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The member who asked the question is not in the House,
but he has indicated to us that Mr Swart will ask the supplementary
questions, if there are any.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you very much, Madam Deputy
Speaker. I was worried, because I had made an arrangement with him earlier
on that one of his questions needed further investigation by us, and,
therefore, we would not be able to answer it today.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is it this one?

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: No, this one is straightforward. I
don’t think it is this one. So I was worried that he may have been under
the impression that it is this question. It is the second one, not this
one.

There are 1 908 of these people who escaped from police custody during the
2005-06 financial year. Not all of them of course escaped from police
cells; some of them escaped from police vehicles and the community service
centres.

The escapees do not include those who escaped from Correctional Services.
[Interjections.] There were none? [Interjections.] OK, I was going to say
you should ask him about those from Correctional Services.

Of course, there are some police officers who connived with some of these
escapees and in so doing facilitated their escape. Departmental
disciplinary procedures were instituted against 38 of them, and 12 members
were convicted through that departmental process. But 31 criminal
prosecutions were preferred against others and two were convicted. Thank
you very much.

Mr S N SWART: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I, firstly, apologise, hon
Minister, that the hon Meshoe is not in the House today.

The ACDP shares concerns regarding escapes from courts, prisons and holding
cells, particularly where such escapes involve high-profile and dangerous
prisoners. One escape is one too many; 1 908 appears to be unacceptable.
When police or prison officials additionally assist in escapes, they put
the lives of colleagues and the public at risk, and it becomes all the more
reprehensible. We therefore welcome the fact, hon Minister, that where
officials have been found to be implicated, they face the full force of the
law.

In view of your response, hon Minister, are you satisfied that sufficient
steps are being taken by the police to prevent persons escaping from
holding cells or when being transported to courts, or appearing in courts?
Will the SAPS continue to probe the possibility of prison officials being
bribed to help Ananias Mathe escape, as suggested by the investigating
team? Thank you very much.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Deputy Speaker, my colleague is
asking if we can share this question. I’ll take a bit and he can take the
rest. [Laughter.] No, it is not a joke, because two departments are
involved. I will take the part that relates to the prisons.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am agreeing to that.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you very much. I hope the hon
member did not say that we are putting in place “suspicious” steps. Did you
say that? What did you say? [Interjections.] Sufficient? Oh, sorry. My ears
are 65 years old this year. [Interjections.] At times I don’t hear. You are
much younger than some of the ancients who are sitting over there.
[Laughter.]

Madam Deputy Speaker, there is nothing that is as overwhelmingly wrong and
in fact highly criminal as law-enforcement agencies that facilitate escapes
by these criminals. Because when they do that, they are actually allowing
people like that to go out and kill their colleagues, which has happened in
the past.

We are taking a very, very serious view of that matter. In fact, we are
looking at measures to deal seriously with people who would allow for this.
I may also mention the fact that we are putting together systems that will
ensure that those who murder these officials are going to face the full
might of the law, because we cannot allow a situation where our members are
murdered. Therefore, if it is their own colleagues, in the first instance,
who create conditions for them to be murdered, we want to do something
which is going to be very drastic to deal with that situation. We are
investigating every avenue that relates to escaped criminals, to find out
if there is anyone in the Service who might be culpable for such an escape.
Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The second part of the response?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Deputy Speaker, I do agree with the
hon member: One escape is one escape too many. I agree with you fully, it
is what I say to my officials all the time.

Our escape record at the moment is looking quite good, because it has gone
completely down in number. Regarding the fact that an awaiting-trial
detainee called Ananias escaped, who was not even supposed to be in that
centre fortunately, we raised this with the portfolio committee last week
concerning the report that had been put together by a team from the NIA,
the SAPS and Correctional Services. That is the report which was then
presented to the portfolio committee last week. It ended with me owning
that report as if it had been written by me. I ended up being the “mampara
of the week”, when, in fact, the report was not my report. The report comes
from that team. But, of course, when you are in these kinds of places you
have to have a thick skin.

That team is working together. We have not disbanded that team. Regarding
that, nine officials have been suspended and are being criminally charged
as well, because we cannot allow a situation where people endanger the
lives of society, and endanger the lives of their colleagues for a few
pieces of silver. We cannot allow that.

Lastly, that report is a team report and they are still following up on the
leads of what happened. They will come up with something much more criminal
than what is in that report. Thank you very much.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, Minister. We hope you don’t earn that title
again this weekend.
Mr M S BOOI: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister, are you in a position to
share a little bit about the effort that they are making to curb this
particular problem? Will you highlight to the House, as you are busy
putting measures in place, what it is that you are really doing to assist
to combat this particular problem of escapees from police cells and the
different cars that they get into? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Deputy Speaker, as I said
earlier on, we are beginning a process where we are converting to high
technology on a number of things. I was going to speak to the chairperson
of the portfolio committee, but I may as well publicly extend this
invitation to her. There are various things that we are doing. On Thursday,
8 March, we are going to a facility in Midrand, Gauteng, that we have
developed. That facility traces people and vehicles. We are therefore going
to be using it to ensure that we cover the country in terms of crime
prevention. Because it relates to crime prevention and even the issue of
escapees, those people who commit crimes and try to use our highways and
freeways to escape are going to face the law-enforcement agencies, because
there is not going to be a way in which they are going to get out of the
rings that we are going to create to deal with that situation.

At the right time, chairperson of the portfolio committee, we are going to
invite members of the portfolio committee to go and see that facility, in
order for you to have a broader understanding of some of the measures we
are beginning to put in place to deal with crime in South Africa. Thank
you.

Mnr R J KING: Minister, kan ek maar asseblief Afrikaans praat? Dankie.

Mev die Speaker, in die geval van ’n polisiebeampte wat verdink word van
hulpverlening aan ’n ontsnapte uit die selle of voertuie of wat die geval
ook al is, uit bewaring, wat is die onmiddellike stappe teen so ’n
verdagte, en kan u dit asseblief, indien moontlik, met ’n voorbeeld
illustreer, wat u onmiddellik doen om op te tree as daar so ’n, ek wil sê,
verdagte vrot appel in die mandjie is? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr R J KING: Minister, may I please speak Afrikaans? Thank you.

Madam Speaker, in the case of a police officer being suspected of rendering
assistance to an escapee from the cells or vehicles or whatever the case
may be, from custody, what are the immediate steps to be taken against such
a suspect, and could you please, if it is possible, illustrate, by using an
example, what immediate steps you take if there is such a - as I would like
to put it - suspected rotten apple in the barrel?]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Deputy Speaker, if members of
the public, including, of course, public representatives such as you come
into possession of such information, we require that information, because,
indeed, we want to get rid of those members who pretend to be law enforcers
who, instead, act criminally. We want to deal with that element. And,
therefore, immediately a person is seen to be committing any crime, please
report it.

There are a number of areas in which reports can be given, including the
general number that we have. I know that at times people are saying they
cannot get through to that number. In fact, the facility that I am talking
about will also address the issue of 10333. But there are others. There is
the ICD which can receive those reports. But the easiest thing to do would
be to report such a person to the nearest police station. And of course we
have a law that allows for civilian arrests of people who commit crimes.
One can even effect a civilian arrest. Thank you.

Mnu V B NDLOVU: Mhlonishwa Phini likaSomlomo, bengicela ukubuza
kumhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe ukuthi ubani othatha isinqumo sokuthi isigebengu
esithile kufanele singene siboshwe imilenze nezinyawo enkantolo? Ngabe
nguMnyango wakho noma uMnyango Wezokuhlunyeleliswa Kwezimilo, kumbe
nguMnyango wezobulungiswa? Ubani othatha isinqumo esinjalo ngoba kubonakala
sengathi kukhona okufanele bakhulekwe imilenze nezinyawo uma beya laphaya?
Kukhona abafana nalabo kodwa bona abangakhulekwa imilenze nezinyawo.
Othatha lesi sinqumo kanti ubani ngempela? (Translation of isiZulu
paragraph follows.)
[Mr V B NDLOVU: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask the hon
Minister who takes the decision to say that a particular prisoner should
appear in court in handcuffs and leg irons? Is it taken by your department
or it is the Department of Correctional Services, or maybe the Department
of Justice? Who makes such a decision, because it looks like there are
those who should be in chains when they go to court only to find that they
are not? Who really takes this decision?]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is up to the Minister, if he would like to respond
to that question. We always ask members to try to stay as close as possible
to the original question. But maybe, because it relates to escapees, it is
up to the two Ministers – also because it is now a two-pronged question. I
think we should now give you another slot of responding, the two of you, if
you want to.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I will give the
greater portion to my colleague. My own answer is: Asindim, baba. [It’s not
me, hon member.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Asindim. [It’s not me.]

The DEPUTY SPEKER: Enkosi. [Thank you.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: How
is it possible that two Ministers respond to each question? Does that mean
that the questioners here will all get two opportunities as well?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Minister, are you done?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: I am not.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: OK, I will come back to you.

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Deputy Speaker, whenever there
is an escape or we have risk-profiled a particular offender, it is
important that that offender is handcuffed and is footcuffed as well when
going to court, because we have to protect the officials. I have lost too
many officials because of offenders who were not cuffed, and I am not going
to take a chance on that at all. The lives of those officials are very
important.

When we get to the courtroom – I am not talking about the police, I am
talking about Correctional Services – in most cases we are able to take off
the footcuffs. But we don’t take the risk, particularly with high-risk
criminals, taking off the handcuffs, because they have to be protected as
well. So I did not take the decision, but I support that people who are
dangerous must be cuffed, end of story. I am working in a security
environment, not in any other environment. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Gibson, there has been an occasion where a member
has been given more than one slot, when they felt they needed more answers
to the question that they had raised. We allowed them to do that. But when
a member actually says “my question is related to two departments” and the
Ministers who have the information are here in the House, and this whole
exercise is about information sharing, we cannot say, “No, only one
Minister may answer.” That is counterproductive. That is actually saying to
us what we are trying to do here is not what we expect to get out of the
exercise. So the purpose of the exercise is that, whatever information is
available here will go to the hon members and to the nation, because the
nation needs that information. Thank you. [Applause.] [Interjections.] We
have more time. Do you want to put more questions to the Ministers?

Mnu A M MPONTSHANE: Mhlonishwa Phini likaSomlomo, bengicela ukusho ukuthi
umbuzo obuzwe yilungu lethu maqondana nokuthi ubani othatha isinqumo
awuphenduliwe.

IPHINI LIKASOMLOMO: Yebo. Ilungu liye labuza maqondana neMinyango
emithathu. Angithi kunjalo baba? Angithi ububuze umbuzo maqondana
neMinyango emithathu? IMinyango emibili iziphendulele kodwa uMnyango
Wezobulungiswa awuphendulanga. [Ubuwelewele.] ONgqongqoshe ababili
bamphendulile. Ilungu lami elihloniphekile lithi lona lijabulile, angazi-ke
wena baba ukuthi ungena ngaphi. [Uhleko.] (Translation of isiZulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker, may I indicate that the
question asked by our member in connection with who takes the decision to
chain prisoners has not been answered.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes. The hon member posed a question to three
departments. Is that so hon member? You asked a question to three
departments? Two departments have answered for themselves but the
Department of Justice has not. [Interjections.] Two Ministers have answered
him. My hon member says he is happy, and I do not know where you fit in,
sir. [Laughter.]]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, the third Minister
is in the House, and in the spirit that you explained ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think this slot belongs to the IFP - unless they are
saying you should speak on their behalf, because I’m sure that they are
able to say exactly what you are saying, Mr Gibson.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I thought that the hon Mpontshane had
finished – I thought he’d finished.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: You just have to polish your isiZulu, then you would
know that he had not finished.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: When he has finished then, perhaps, I
could have a turn at addressing you, Madam, in the spirit of telling the
nation what’s going on.

Mnu V B NDLOVU: Phini likaSomlomo, bese ngilindele ukuthi mhlawumbe

(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Deputy Speaker, I was expecting that maybe the hon
Minister of Justice would say she is the one who decides because the other
two said it’s not them. I asked all three of them.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Have a seat, sir. I will not ask the Minister, except
if she wants to talk about this matter, because I said ...]

... the question that was raised and the questions that are raised as
supplementary questions should be as close as possible to the initial
question. I said to them it is up to them to answer if they felt like it,
but they are not compelled under this exercise to do so, because the
question is not a supplementary question at all, it’s a new question. They
have honoured you by responding to you. And I’m going to ask that the
Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development do so, if she feels
that she would like to respond to you. But if she does not feel like it,
then we shall proceed. Justice? [Interjections.]

Mr Ellis, there’s no Brigette. No matter how excited we get, we are hon
members! She is hon Brigette Mabandla or hon Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Development. Are we agreed on that, hon Ellis? Now, let’s
give the opportunity to the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, you did indicate
... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Deputy Minister, please take your seat. You were
speaking on behalf of the IFP. The IFP ... [Interjections.] I beg your
pardon?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: You assumed that I was ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, you said so. You said you were speaking because you
thought you were putting across better what Mr Mpontshane had said to the
House. Mr Ndlovu has done that very well and we are done with that matter.
[Interjections.] On which point are you rising?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam, you wouldn’t allow me to continue
so that I can finish ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: On which point are you rising now?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I’m now rising on a point of asking
whether the hon Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development won’t
reconsider the question, in the spirit of advising the nation about how
many people have escaped from holding cells? You explained how important it
is for as many Ministers who are in the House to address the nation. Now,
why don’t we give her an opportunity to reconsider her decision to say no?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I don’t think the Minister has a problem in answering
that question. Put the question down. You are asking how many people
escaped? I do not think that even if you had that responsibility, Mr
Gibson, you would at any point in time be able to give the statistics.
Write down that question and let it go to the Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Development. I now close this matter on the Minister for
Justice and Constitutional Development. She is not answering any other
questions! Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, are we finally going to hear
you?

      South Africa’s role in defusing the volatile situation in Somalia

9.    Ms F Hajaig (ANC) asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs:



      (1)   What will South Africa, as chair of the peace, security and
           stability organ of the African Union, do to assist in defusing
           the volatile situation in Somalia;




       (2)  whether the AU will be able to gather all role-players around
           the negotiation table; if not, why not; if so, what are the
           relevant details;


       (3)  whether the intervention of the USA will be a positive factor in
           the resolution of this conflict, considering South Africa’s
           position of multi-lateral intervention in any area of conflict;
           if not, what is the position in this regard; if so, what are the
           relevant details?                 N212E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr A G H Pahad): Deputy Speaker, as
I was saying before I was rudely interrupted ... [Laughter.] The answer to
point number one is that, in our capacity as the non-permanent member of
the Security Council for the next two years, and as the President of the
United Nations Security Council for the month of March 2007 and our
membership of the AU, South Africa will continue to support the efforts of
the UN, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development in bringing about peace in Somalia.

South Africa supports the national reconciliation process in Somalia and is
committed to assisting Somalia to assist the Somalia Transitional Federal
Government to ensure that the national reconciliation process is all-
inclusive and incorporates all relevant role-players, including civil
society, clan elders, elements of the Islamic Conference and the warlords.

The situation in Somalia is very volatile and violence is increasing. The
United Nations Security Council has just passed a resolution sanctioning
the dispatch of African Union forces to Somalia. We are now in the process,
through the African Union, to try to get the 8 000 African troops to go to
Somalia.

Regarding part two of the question, South Africa, through the AU, remains
committed to ensuring the involvement of all the role-players in the peace
process. We believe that all role-players who are committed to negotiations
and who are prepared to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in the
state should be part of the process.

The interim Prime Minister of Somalia, Ali Ghedi, has recently agreed to
hold talks with all the relevant parties in the peace process, including
the leadership and members of the United Islamic Courts. This is also the
position of the African Union and the Security Council.

With regard to part three of the question, America’s current intervention
in Somalia is, lastly, in contact with multilateral efforts. Currently,
these efforts are being exercised through its membership of the United
Nations Security Council, the role it plays in the international contact
group on Somalia and through the funding of the AU mission in Somalia’s
peacekeeping force.

To this extent, the involvement is constructive. Furthermore, it is our
understanding that the US is in support of the inclusive political
dialogue, consistent with the earlier statements I have made.

Ms F HAJAIG: Thank you, hon Deputy Minister, for your comprehensive reply.
Will South Africa, in light of our various commitments elsewhere in Africa,
be able to support Somalia to re-establish institutions of governance and
train people to serve in various capacities in the post-conflict
reconstruction of Somalia?

Further, if I may ask, how can South Africa assist in stopping more small
arms and light weapons entering Africa, especially in conflict areas?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr A G H Pahad): Firstly, let me
say that we are committed to assisting Somalia in every way possible to
establish institutions of government. We cannot do it on our own. We would
have to do it in partnership with the AU, the United Nations and the
European Union, because the tasks are tremendous. I think we will do
everything possible to achieve that.

The issue of small arms proliferating in Africa has been a huge problem for
us for some time. We are signatories to all the relevant conventions on
this. We will continue to work with the United Nations and the African
Union to try to stop the flow of small arms to African conflict areas.

Mr L B LABUSCHAGNE: Minister, thank you for your reply. The situation in
Somalia is of course unacceptable to all of us, and it is clear that we in
South Africa, like our fellow Africans all over the continent, would like
to see a peaceful outcome. Surely, Minister, the costs of logistics of
peacekeeping are far beyond anything the AU can afford. Surely, the AU
troops as well as our troops are stressed financially.

My question is whether we are prepared to actively engage the United States
to contribute financially to assist the African Union and South Africa, and
if needs be, to cover the costs of these operations?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr A G H Pahad): Chairperson, it is
sometimes a problem when colleagues don’t listen to what we say. I’ve just
said that the United States, as part of the Security Council and indeed as
part of the contact group on Somalia, have already committed financial
assistance to the AU forces for Somalia, and we will continue to deal with
the United States and the European Union, and, indeed, the United Nations,
to strive to ensure that enough resources are being made available for the
African force to be effective in Somalia.

Adv Z L MADASA: Hon Deputy Minister, of course, the biggest challenge with
regard to these peacekeeping efforts, as you have just indicated, is
resources. It was mooted at some point that there is a move to raise the
issue with the United Nations, regarding recognising AU peacekeeping
missions as regional missions of the United Nations, and to recognise the
AU as a regional entity of the UN, so that all these missions in that way
became UN missions so that we do not have the necessity of asking all the
time that the AU missions be converted. They can then automatically become
UN missions by recognising AU peacekeeping missions as regional missions of
the United Nations. I would like to know if there is any progress with
regard to this proposal? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr A G H Pahad): There is nothing
automatic about the process. The United Nations Security Council, which is
charged with dealing with conflicts entrenched in international peace and
security, discusses each issue on its merits.

There is now a growing acceptance that it would be better to utilise
regional structures to deal with regional problems. In many of the African
conflict situations, which are over 70% of the UN Security Council agenda,
we do try to ensure that they become a UN initiative, and are then, by and
large, supported by the presence of African troops in these conflict
situations.

Let me quickly add that we do not want a situation to arise where the
developed countries determine that this is no longer their problem and they
just pass it on to the regional groups. We want to help them remain seized
with us and, according to each conflict, determine what assistance the US
will give to our African initiatives.

   Attack on nurses at a youth centre in the Baviaanspoort Management Area

4.    Bishop L J Tolo (ANC) asked the Minister of Correctional Services:



      (1)   What happened to the inmates who attacked and injured two nurses
           at a certain youth centre (name furnished) in the Baviaanspoort
           Management Area in Gauteng on 11 August 2005;


      (2)   whether any of these inmates were sentenced for this offence; if
           not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                                              N206E

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, hon Tolo, both inmates
were transferred immediately from eMthonjeni Youth Centre in Baviaanspoort
to C-Max facility in Pretoria. A case of rape, murder and assault was
opened against both inmates.

The reply to the second part of the question is that the case against one
of the inmates was withdrawn by the National Prosecuting Authority owing to
a lack of evidence. The other inmate will appear in the High Court in
August this year. We do know what is going to happen there. If he gets
sentenced, we will move him to Kokstad super C-Max.

Mopishopo L J TOLO: Ke a leboga Modulasetulo. Mohlomphegi Tona ya Ditirelo
tša Tshokollo ya Bagolegwa, karabo ya gago e tloge e re thabiša. Potšišo ke

kopane le bothata kae moo le tšerego nako go tla go re sedimoša bjalo ka
Palamente goba setšhaba? (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[Bishop L J TOLO: Thank you, Chairperson. The hon Minister of Correctional
Services, we are pleased with your response. But the question is: What was
the problem that it took you so long to bring the response to Parliament or
to the public because the problem occurred back in 2005?]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: I am sorry, Chairperson, the
Minister of Finance is really heckling me today. He wants to speak on my
behalf. I am not sure why I deserve this attention from him but he seems to
like me too much today.

Bishop Tolo, we haven’t had a chance to come back to the portfolio
committee to report on this particular case. But we have to work with other
cases that you have asked us, as the portfolio committee, to work on. This
particular case was one of the most painful, because I had to attend to it
that Sunday afternoon. We have been following this up with the National
Prosecuting Authority. We have been saying to them: “Please, speed up the
case so that it can be closed and we can move on and look at other
centres.”

What happened there is that one of those two inmates actually did us a
disservice by attacking those nurses - people who were there to assist
inmates and to make sure that they get the necessary medical attention.
That has caused us quite a lot of no good. But I hope that the officials,
wherever they are in all 243 centres in the country, will always be
vigilant when they work in a correctional centre, because they are working
with people who can do anything at any given time.

I am also appealing to offenders, whether they belong to numbers or
gangsters, not to do that, because at the end of the day they are causing a
problem for themselves with further charges. Also, these are some of the
offenders, I think, we are not naive enough to believe will change. Some of
them will not change; they will just continue doing the kinds of things
that they are doing. We are appealing to offenders to really try their best
to participate in programmes and not get involved in all these criminal
activities.

Mr J SELFE: Chairperson, I should like to thank the hon Minister for his
reply. I am sure that he appreciates that female officials who work
particularly in high security centres are uniquely vulnerable in that
environment. It is very often said by male officials that they have to look
after themselves and also after their female colleagues in those
circumstances. So, what I would like to know is what additional steps the
Minister is contemplating to improve security, particularly for female
staff working in correctional centres? Specifically, if those female
officials were in any way attacked, what assistance was given to them to
recover from the trauma that they suffered?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, we do risk-profiling of
offenders, whether they are awaiting trial or they are sentenced offenders.
As they come into our centres, we have what we call the offender
rehabilitation path, where we check on all the sentences and everything
that they have been sent to us for and make sure that we classify them
correctly. That is the first thing. We have to classify them correctly and
make sure that they are in a maximum security centre if they need to go
there.

The second thing is that we have an anti-gang strategy that we are
employing to try and crush the gangs which are operating in our prisons.
That is something that we are all geared to with my officials, to make sure
that we clean up on those. But those gangsters who don’t seem to want to
change or are totally cheeky and silly, we put aside and get officials who
can look after them, because we cannot change them.

We are also declassifying certain maximum centres so that we know how much
danger people will be exposed to in that maximum centre, and how many
females will we put in there. My heart still goes out to those nurses, hon
member. We have given their families support. There is also a settlement
that we have reached with them. But, together with all the other officials,
I take my hat off to those brave men and women who work under these
difficult circumstances in our prisons.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, hon Minister, these criminals who committed
these crimes in prisons had already been sentenced and had been told
whatever sentence they had to serve. Now that they have committed new
crimes, what further sentence will you bestow on these people?
The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: MaMkhize, when offenders that are
sentenced do commit these further offences, we do not take the law into our
own hands. If there has been a criminal offence that has been committed, we
let the police know and they have to go through the courts again to receive
their further sentences for that.

Therefore, it is not up to us to sentence them; we do not give sentences.
It is the duty of the judiciary and magistrates to do that, and we respect
them for that. But, at least, we know that once they get further charges it
adds to the years that they still have to stay in prison.

And we don’t make prison life very, very comfortable for all prisoners that
are inside. We are trying our best to make sure that privileges are
limited. Once you commit a crime, we try to use the incentive-based system
so that, through incentives, you go up from being a phase-1 offender to
another phase. We are trying to encourage them to get out of prison rather
than staying in prison.

Mrs S A SEATON: Chairperson, can the hon Minister tell us what example is
made of these people? Besides the fact that they are going to be tried,
etc, what example is made of people who do things like these to members of
staff that are assisting them in the prison system? How do other inmates
get to know what you are going to do about such a situation?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Hon Seaton, you really are putting
me in trouble now. But I do know for a fact that, first of all, we get the
police to charge them. Secondly, we ask the judge – because we have the
Inspecting Judge – if this particular offender who has created this havoc
can be isolated. We can’t just isolate them without getting that
permission.

Also, concerning the issue of putting them in handcuffs and in footcuffs,
we have to ask the judge. I don’t want a situation where my members take
the law into their own hands. That’s not what we want. But we want to make
sure that we send a strong message to offenders that this type of behaviour
will not be tolerated at all.

Therefore, they go through the courts and get sentenced and we send them to
wherever we have to send them. But there should be no assault from anybody
for whatever crime has been committed; we can’t afford that. We’ve to run
these prisons in a much more humane way, as much as we can.

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


   That Rule 253(1), which provides inter alia that the debate on the Second
   Reading of a Bill may not commence before at least three working days
   have elapsed since the committee’s report was tabled, be suspended for
   the purposes of conducting the Second Reading debate on the South African
   Airways Bill [B 35 - 2006] (National Assembly – sec 75) on Thursday, 1
   March 2007.

Agreed to.


                                FINANCE BILL


                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, in terms of section 213 of the
Constitution, the withdrawal of money from the National Revenue Fund as a
direct charge must be provided for in an Act of Parliament – this is the
story we were talking about with the Minister of Correctional Services.

In terms of section 77, read with section 73, a Bill that authorises a
direct charge is a money Bill that must be introduced by the Minister of
Finance. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts recommended that
Parliament approves certain unauthorised expenditure arising from the 1993-
94 fiscal year, right up to 2003-04 year, as a direct charge against the
National Revenue Fund. The Finance Bill before the House represents this
Act of Parliament and approves an amount of R473,1 million of unauthorised
expenditure, giving effect to Scopa’s recommendation.

I hereby table the Finance Bill, Bill 5 of 2007. Thank you. [Applause.]

The Minister of Finance introduced the Bill.

Bill referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance for consideration and
report.


                          DIVISION OF REVENUE BILL


                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, section 214 of the
Constitution requires that the government ensures a transparent and
equitable system to divide nationally raised revenue between the three
spheres. The Constitution also enjoins our three spheres of government to
co-operate.

The Division of Revenue Bill we tabled in this House last Wednesday is an
expression of the co-operative relations between the three spheres of
government. By setting out three allocations for the equitable shares and
conditional grants for provinces and local government, the Division of
Revenue Bill further entrenches the transparency and accountability in our
intergovernmental fiscal system.

It allows all spheres to plan ahead and get down to the business of
delivering services to our people. Provinces and municipalities will budget
for these allocations, each determining how its share of funds will be used
to give effect to the policy priorities that have been agreed on through
the Minmecs, the Budget Council, the Budget Forum and the extended Cabinet.

From 1 March of last year, our country’s municipal and provincial
boundaries were redemarcated. The resource allocation aspect of these
changes were introduced in the municipalities from 1 July of last year,
while the changes for provinces will only take effect from 1 April this
year.

I am pleased to advise this House that all allocations contained in the
2007 Division of Revenue Bill have been determined on the basis of the new
boundaries. The division of revenue set out in this year’s Bill gives
further impetus to accelerating economic growth, modernising our public
services and infrastructure, and reducing poverty and inequality.

The Budget framework allocates R89,5 billion in additional spending over
the next three years. National departments will receive R32,3 billion of
this, provinces R39,2 billion, and municipalities R18,1 billion.

True to our commitment to fighting poverty and vulnerability, the shares of
provincial and local government rise by one percentage point each over the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework period. Schedule 1 of the Bill provides
the summary of the allocation of funds for the three spheres. After setting
aside R52,9 billion for debt service costs, this Bill allocates R289
billion to national departments and their agencies, R171,3 billion to
provinces, and R20 billion to local government in the 2007-08 financial
year.

Including a contingency reserve of R3 billion, total government spending
amounts to R533,9 billion, growing by a whopping 7,7% in real terms to
R650,3 last year. Transfers to provinces grow by 12,7% a year, with the
bulk of additional resources going towards education and health personnel,
social welfare services, and provincial infrastructure. An additional R8,1
billion is allocated for the hiring of teachers, teaching assistants,
support staff in schools and districts to improve remuneration levels of
teachers.

Together with resources set aside in the provincial equitable share for the
implementation of no-fee schools and a substantial increase in resources
for classroom building and provision of water, electricity and sanitation
in schools, these resources should go a long way to improving the quality
of teaching and learning in public schools, where the majority of South
African children learn.

This should accelerate the process of closing the gap between spending per
learner and spending per learner between private and public schools, thus
giving meaning to the theme of this year’s Budget, that human life has
equal worth.

Provincial budgets will reinforce the strengthening of the health sectors,
so that South Africans who do not have medical insurance can also enjoy
good quality health care.

In respect of local government, over the next three years, municipalities
will receive R129,2 billion, including R7,4 billion in allocations in kind
or an additional R20,4 billion of the 2006 baselines.

The Municipal Infrastructure Grant receives R400 million more to speed up
the completion of the eradication of bucket sanitation; a further R600
million for the electrification programme; R1,4 billion for bulk water and
sanitation infrastructure, and R950 million to deliver water and
electricity to schools and clinics. This was one of the questions asked
earlier today.

The public transport infrastructure and systems grants, and the local
neighbourhood development partnership grant are allocated R6,7 and R3,7
billion over the 2007 MTEF period.

Turning to the Financial and Fiscal Commission, the division of revenue set
out in the Bill before this House today takes account of the
recommendations we received from the FFC. The explanatory memorandum to the
Bill contains government’s response to the FFC’s recommendations, and this
is set out between pages 53 and 90 of the Division of Revenue Bill.

As the response indicates, we are in broad agreement with most of the
recommendations that are contained in the FFC’s original submission. The
differences are, firstly, in the proposal from the FFC that we roll the
Hospital Revitalisation Grant into the Infrastructure Grant for Provinces.
We respectfully disagree with this proposal, because we would like to
maintain the momentum that the Hospital Revitalisation Programme has
gathered to date.

Secondly, the FFC proposes that we merge the Land Care Grants and the
Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme. Again, we respectfully
disagree with the FFC in this regard, because we are of the view that the
two grants serve very different purposes. The Land Care Grant funds land
rehabilitation and restoration, while CASP provides targeted support to
beneficiaries of the Redistribution for Agricultural Development Programme.
In their submission to the Portfolio Committee on Finance on 22 February,
the FFC tabled an entirely new proposal suggesting, and I quote, that our:


   ... economic assumptions ...  verified by an independent, competent
   public authority.

Because this proposal was not part of the original submission, we have not
had the opportunity to comment on or respond to it until now. Without
derogating from the constitutional independence of the FFC ...
[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Hon Minister, just a minute. Hon
members, I think the level of noise is now getting out of order. We are no
longer listening to what the Minister is trying to say.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: I think hon Mabe will be speaking as well, so ...

Without derogating from the constitutional independence of the FFC, we find
this proposal particularly problematic. Budget decisions in all modern
democracies are intensely politically driven. The macroeconomic assumptions
so vital to the construction of the fiscal framework are an integral part
of these decisions.

It’s quite hard to contemplate what it means to subject its decisions to
the scrutiny of independent, competent public authorities, as the FFC
suggests, especially since all parties fight elections for the purpose of
being able to advance their policy preferences, and the recognition that
this would not be possible unless an elected government could decide on the
Budget.

The proposal begs the question: What additional information and capacity
will such independent, competent public authority have to produce better
quality forecasts than government has? Moreover, is government not a public
authority elected for this purpose?

Perhaps the view of the FFC is that whilst government might be a public
authority, it’s not competent to take responsibility for its macroeconomic
assumptions. Perhaps the view may exist that whilst government is a public
authority, and whilst it may even be competent, economic decisions need to
be taken by political eunuchs.

It is possible to give all manner of interpretation to this new proposal
from the FFC. It is government’s view that this submission is incorrect. I
invite this House to support us in rejecting this proposal from the FFC.

On that note, I want to reiterate that the Division of Revenue Bill before
this House places us in a better position to do things that we never
imagined possible a decade ago. On Friday last week, we launched the second
discussion paper on social security and retirement reform at the Nedlac
offices in Johannesburg. In it, we set out our thoughts on how we’d like to
see the social security system unfold in the period ahead.

I invite members of this House to study these proposals, which can be found
on the website of the National Treasury. These proposals are about
providing for our people, post-retirement.

Again, we say: Human life has equal worth, and you will find the measure of
this in the Division of Revenue Bill that serves before this House. Thank
you very much. [Applause.]

Mr N M NENE: Chairperson and hon members of this House, on the occasion of
the tabling of the Budget last week, I was intimidated by the Minister of
Finance when he mentioned the aggregated budget over the coming Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework period. I am still struggling to explain to my
constituency in the small town of Kranskop how much two trillion is, let
alone translate it into isiZulu. [Interjections.] No, there are no noughts
in isiZulu.

Uzongisiza baba uSkosana siyibhale phansi. [Hon Skosana will help me write
it down.]

The Division of Revenue Bill is a constitutional requirement that presents
us with the opportunity to, at least, address ourselves to the coming
financial year’s Budget, as it is vertically allocated to the three spheres
of government. This Bill is a culmination of a lengthy process of
consultation amongst these spheres of government co-ordinated by the
Ministry of Finance. I refer here to the Budget Council, the Budget Forum
meetings of the national departments and other forums that the Minister has
alluded to that include all stakeholders in the Budget process.

This process gives effect to one of the key pillars of the Reconstruction
and Development Programme – that of democratising society and the state.
The RDP is at the centre of the ANC-led government’s agenda to fight
poverty and bring about sustainable development. Both the January 8
Statement and the state of the nation address enjoin all three state organs
and society to benchmark all our programmes against the RDP, as is evident
in this Division of Revenue Bill. The equitable division of revenue amongst
the three spheres of government is also premised on one of the main pillars
of the RDP - that of meeting the basic needs of the people.

Chapter 8 of the 2007 Budget Review outlines the shift that reflects a
significant increase in the allocation to local government and provincial
governments, that sees more than 60% of additional allocations transferred
to these spheres. This is in line with the continuing trend of ensuring
that more funding is deployed where actual delivery needs to take place –
that is, at local and provincial government levels.
Local government’s share of national revenue shows the strongest growth, of
19%, over the MTEF period, according to this chapter, mainly to support the
roll-out of free basic services and infrastructure; while national and
provincial shares grow by 10,3% and 12,7% respectively. The provincial
allocations mainly cater for the acceleration of social services, with a
particular focus on housing, education, HIV and Aids, hospital
revitalisation and public transport.

[The commitment of the ANC-led government to make better life for all is
clearly evident in this Budget, especially when it is distributed to
different spheres of government. The larger portion of the amount is
gradually directed to the provinces and the local governments where the
work of making people's lives better is.

The building of infrastructure is core in getting rid of hunger and it is
the foundation of economic development in our places. This distribution of
revenue to provinces sees to it that poverty and backwardness in provinces
are addressed with the aim of uplifting the lives of the people.

The delivery of services to the people also receives a larger amount to
those areas that are far behind with development. Let me say here, Madam
Speaker, that maybe one must agree with hon Mpontshane that we need to work
a little harder in delivering services like water, electricity and the
eradication of the bucket system. More should be done to do away with this
situation. [Interjections.] No, we agree. We are not used to agreeing, but
we agree with hon Mpontshane.]

We are always warned by the defenders of apartheid that we should not blame
our backlogs on apartheid. But it is not possible to forget that had
apartheid not excluded the vast majority of our people from the provision
of basic services, we would not be talking about it today. The resources
that are being spent on addressing the backlogs would have been used in
maintaining the infrastructure instead of building it. Thanks go to the
people of South Africa for realising that only the ANC could deliver them
from the evils of apartheid, and our resolve to do so is growing stronger
by the day.

One of the flagship programmes that receives a sizeable chunk of funding is
the neighbourhood development partnership. This grant provides financial
assistance to municipalities for partnership-based community and commercial
infrastructure in townships and informal settlements. Its main focus is on
precinct, town centre and high street development projects with an
estimated project value of over R9,2 billion over the next decade. As
explained in the Budget Review, it supports the creation of high-quality
development that aims to overcome spatial and economic distortions endemic
to townships.

The principle here is to retain and increase the buying power within
townships, and create environments that improve the quality of life and
attract private sector investment. In his speech, the Minister mentioned
the areas that have taken advantage of this programme, taking up an amount
of about R50 million in technical assistance to date.

A number of other grants are allocated to provincial and local governments
to further strengthen and enhance service delivery in these spheres. Of
particular note to provinces, is the Community Library Services Grant,
which is meant to consolidate library services at provincial level. We
trust that this grant will be put to good use, and promote the culture of
reading, especially if library services are going to be located where the
majority of the people live, and be properly and adequately resourced.

My colleagues will speak on the other grant allocations and the Financial
and Fiscal Commission’s recommendations. Minister, I trust that Ms Mabe
will cover that area that you raised as a concern. Ms Mokoto will focus on
the 2010 Fifa World Cup, related funding and the capacity-building
transfers. Ms Mabe will also have to cover the expenditure trends in
provinces and our oversight role as Parliament.

The ANC government’s commitment to achieving a better life for all is a
matter of policy, and not grandstanding, as colleagues on the other side of
the iron always make it. It dates back to our founding, and our record
speaks for itself.

The committee considered the Division of Revenue Bill and passed it without
amendments. We trust that the Select Committee on Finance will apply its
mind without prejudice, and with the information at their disposal. They
are under no obligation to endorse our position. If it is in the interest
of the country, they have every right to propose amendments. The ANC
supports the passing of the Division of Revenue Bill in this House. I thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Chair, the Financial and Fiscal Commission is required by
both the Constitution and the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act to
give comment on government’s annual Division of Revenue Bill. The
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act also requires the Minister of
Finance to consult with the commission prior to the introduction of the
Division of Revenue Bill. In preparing its commentary on the Division of
Revenue Bill, the commission assesses and analyses the equitable allocation
of revenue amongst the three spheres, and horizontally within each sphere
of government, taking into account key principles of intergovernmental
fiscal relations in South Africa.

The commission’s overall finding is that it is in agreement with the
general spirit in which the 2007-08 Division of Revenue Bill has been
drafted, a view which the DA endorses. In its commentary, the commission
makes submissions on the macroeconomic implications of the division of
revenue proposals. It is these submissions that I would like to further
comment on.
It is correctly stated that the Bill is premised on important economic
assumptions that underpin the macroeconomic projections used to determine
the overall resource envelope underlying the Bill. What is referred to here
is a set of macroeconomic forecasts which will determine the value of
important fiscal variables. As we are all aware, very often market outcomes
will deviate from the forecasts, resulting in - as you have seen over the
last three years - substantial budget revenue overruns. These overruns have
been increasing from R11,6 billion for the 2004-05 financial year to R44,5
billion for 2005-06, and an estimated R32,8 billion for 2006-07. If prior
estimations are anything to go by, it would not surprise me if the final
figure for 2006-07 is even higher.

Now, I am aware that tax revenue buoyancy is primarily a factor of new
revenue resources, improvements in tax administration compliance in
collection and, importantly, higher nominal gross domestic product. I am
also aware that Treasury has determined the average responsiveness of gross
tax revenue to changes in nominal GDP.

Without detracting from the efficiency of Sars, it is the accuracy of the
forecasting of nominal GDP which perhaps bears closer scrutiny. The
overruns have not escaped the attention of the International Monetary Fund,
which has in the past expressed concerns about “the repeated
underestimation of tax revenues”. The IMF said in 2005 that overruns
needed:

  ... careful investigation, possibly leading to adjustments in revenue
  forecasting methods and procedures. Reliable revenue projections are
  particularly important for the design of credible medium-term expenditure
  plans.

In a written response to the IMF’s concerns, the Treasury said it agreed
that its revenue forecasting should be improved, and yet, as we have noted
since then, the overruns remain indeed increased in size.

It is with these points in mind that the commission’s recommendation of
independent verification of underlying macroeconomic assumptions – not
policy assumptions, the Minister is quite right in respect of policy
assumptions, that is a preserve of the ruling government – cannot be
dismissed lightly. Likewise their recommendation that this process be
institutionalised, which they are correct in saying, would raise even
further the transparency and credibility of the forecasts moving forward.

Following on the whole question of revenue overruns is a related matter of
the ratio of revenue to domestic product. This ratio, as the commission
points out, is expected to be as high as 28,2%. Now, the commission raises
a pertinent question as to whether the tax burden is too high and
therefore, as it puts it, inimical to economic growth.

Now, it is not my intention to debate here any of the levels of taxation or
recent changes to these levels, or the nature of such changes announced by
the Minister in his recent Budget Speech. That could possibly be dealt with
in the Budget debate. Where I do seek clarity is on the government’s policy
or philosophy in respect of the whole question of taxation. So, it is not
the technicalities of the tax numbers that we need to hear, but rather the
underlying philosophy.

Leading on from that, I am not aware of what informed the often-quoted
benchmark of 25% revenue to GDP as being the optimal desired percentage
revenue burden. This is a figure that Treasury itself has often mentioned.
Is this still appropriate? If not, what informs government’s thinking as to
the change? As indicated, the ratio is now well beyond that figure, and
that is even before the imposition of the royalty tax, as well as any
windfall tax on the synthetic fuels industry or on the mineral resource
industry as a whole.

I have to identify with the sentiment of the commission expressed, namely
that policy choices should be informed not only by up-to-date needs and the
capacity of the economy, but by international benchmarking experience.
Surely there has to be a case against ad hoc changes to the fiscal regime
in favour of the certainty of a stated policy or philosophy by government
which, barring exogenous shocks, would be implemented by government over a
stated timeframe and under certain conditions. Surely it is this certainty
that will help produce a positive climate for investment.

Finally, I would like to mention two specific comments which the commission
made, which I find myself in agreement with. The first is in respect of the
Municipal Infrastructure Grant where it recommended that the formula be
reviewed to take into account the operational and maintenance needs of
infrastructure roll-out.

While it is accepted in principle that municipalities, in line with section
17(2) of Municipal Finance Management Act, should fund the maintenance and
operations from their own budgets, the reality is that some municipalities
just do not have sufficient resources to do so. I am reliably informed by
officials in the programme that this often results in costly projects
degenerating into all but unusable condition as a result of the reality of
a lack of sufficient resources for operations and maintenance.

Secondly, and briefly, in respect of the national housing allocation, the
commission proposed that the formula should take into account the
variations in regional costs for constructing subsidised housing, and
ensuring uniform standards across the provinces.

While I appreciate the government’s desire not to unduly further complicate
the formula, it has to be acknowledged that the recommendation stems from
the significant impact that variations in regional costs have on the
quality, completion and lifespan of the government-subsidised houses, not
least of which is the cost of land which differs significantly across
regions.

The resulting implication is that the cost of meeting the same quality and
the standards set out by the national Department of Housing can differ
greatly, depending on the location of the housing project. Notwithstanding,
the DA supports the Bill. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Chair, the 2007 Division of Revenue Bill provides for
the equitable division of nationally-raised revenue between the three
spheres of government. This year the amount to be shared between national,
provincial and local governments amounts to R480 billion. In the 2007-08
financial year, a total amount of R202 billion consisting of the equitable
share and conditional grants will be transferred to the nine provinces to
meet their expenditure responsibilities. Local government will receive R34
billion in this financial year to improve their delivery of basic services
such as water, sanitation, roads and infrastructure.

The Minister has indicated that the National Treasury has not accepted
certain Financial and Fiscal Commission recommendations about conditional
grants to provincial and local government. For instance, the FFC wanted the
Land Care Grant and the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Grant to be
placed together to lessen the administrative workload for the provinces,
but Treasury disagreed. Other grants that were the subject of disagreement
included the Municipal Infrastructure Grant and the National Human
Settlement Grant.

The IFP accepts that, from time to time, there will be disagreements
between the FFC and the government. But, considering the vital role played
by this institution, the FFC, we have to raise concern that it could be
sidelined if care is not taken.

Faster than expected, national economic growth in the last few years and
better tax collection have meant that the Minister of Finance is in the
fortunate position of having a larger revenue cake to slice up between the
three spheres of government. However, the availability of money to allocate
is no longer the main problem. The main problem now is the ability of
provincial and local governments to spend their allocations for the
provision of basic services, infrastructure and other essential functions.

Over the past few weeks Parliament has heard that the third quarter
spending in the 2006-07 financial year by provincial departments is lagging
behind target. For instance, provincial departments of public works and
transport had spent 63% of their allocations by the end of the third
quarter.

Even more worrying is the fact that local governments are even worse off in
terms of their ability to spend the allocated grants. For instance,
municipalities were able to spend only 46% of total municipal
infrastructure grants in the first three quarters of the current financial
year. In total, some 106 municipalities or about one-third have been
classified as underspenders. Therefore, the IFP welcomes the actions of the
Department of Provincial and Local Government to delay payments to
municipalities that are unable to spend their allocations. Even more so,
the IFP applauds the fact that such allocations may, in fact, be cancelled
and diverted to local governments that have the ability to spend it.

The IFP supports the Division of Revenue Bill. But, we stress that
allocating money is one thing, efficiently spending it on projects that
address the needs of the poorest communities is a completely different
animal. We need more interventions from the relevant authorities to ensure
that spending is stepped up and we need closer monitoring to ensure that
allocations are in fact translated into basic services, improved
infrastructure and other improvements in people’s daily lives. The IFP
supports the Budget. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J BICI: Madam Chair, hon members, the UDM would like to take this
opportunity to congratulate the Minister of Finance on a good national
Budget made possible by revenue collection again exceeding forecast. The
UDM is pleased with the salary increase for teachers, medical workers,
social workers and Police Service members. They are the backbone of
building a caring and democratic society.

The social grant increase is welcomed, though it is relatively small. We
believe that, with the better than the expected revenue at its disposal,
the government should show its commitment to the fight against HIV/Aids by
lowering the threshold for ARV treatment. For instance, by commencing
treatment at a higher CD4 count than currently is the case would mean we
would be saving more lives by providing treatment at an early age.

Notwithstanding the good intentions of the national Budget, we are
concerned about the ability of departments, provinces and local governments
to spend money correctly. These capacity and management shortfalls are
significant and have the perverse effect that big budgets are promised but
often little delivery occurs.

The Division of Revenue correctly seeks to distribute the bulk of revenue
to the lower spheres of government. However, their capacity to correctly
utilise this revenue remains suspect. The array of grants and conditional
grants earmarking infrastructure development of some sort or another are
welcomed and should go a long way towards addressing the grievances of
those neglected communities who now resort to protest and unrest to draw
attention to their plight. Nevertheless, the UDM supports the Bill. Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr A HARDING: Madam Chair, consolidated non-interest expenditure by all
spheres is set to increase at an annual nominal average rate of 11,9% over
the next three years or 6,2% in real terms. Social services expenditure is
set to increase at an annual average real rate of 6% over the next three
years. Social expenditure therefore increases at a faster rate than
expected GDP growth. Given the huge resources now at the government’s
disposal and the increase in the tax to GDP ratio, this is not surprising.
However, social expenditure grows at a slightly lower rate than total
government expenditure. This, to the ID, indicates a subtle shift from
social towards the economic function of the MTEF period.

The new year budget allocation to national departments represents the
largest share of the national Budget. Subnational governments will
collectively receive the larger share of additional resources in the
consecutive two years. This raises serious questions, in light of local and
provincial government spending ability.

The provincial equitable share is projected to grow by a real annual
average rate which is slightly higher than forecasted economic growth rates
over that period. This raises possible future funding questions for the
Minister or alternatively an adjustment in allocations.

The emphasis in the Minister’s speech as well as in the Budget Review is on
fostering growth while remaining aware of the risks associated with
increased integration in a global economy. However, the ID would have
welcomed a more robust increase in social services expenditure but with
specific emphasis on the social grant. There is no doubt that savings to
fund investment are required and that the government savings are but only
one way of achieving this. It remains imperative to balance long-term
investment needs with measures which soften the impact of poverty now.

In the final analysis, much rests with the validity of how policy-makers
currently assess risk and therefore what constitutes due prudence. It is
hoped that, in looking back from the future, it will not be decided that
the actions taken were not bold enough. The ID supports the Bill. [Time
expired.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, hon Minister, you will recall that last year the
ACDP raised the issue as to whether the equitable share formula had been
realigned, following the redemarcation of provincial boundaries. As pointed
out in the 2007 Budget Review, the demarcation affects education, health,
poverty and economic activity components of the formula.

The ACDP welcomes changes to the provincial equitable shares implemented in
the 2007 Budget as this will undoubtedly allay fears regarding service
delivery to those communities whose municipalities have been moved from one
province to another. Provinces are preparing their 2007 budgets based on
the realigned provincial equitable shares. Hon Minister, are you expecting
any further adjustments to be made? Is it expected that there will be
additional costs and if so, will they be substantial?

The FFC proposed that:


  Any additional costs faced by the provinces and municipalities that
  cannot be met through the revised equitable share allocations be funded
  through a once-off allocation from national government.

The government's response to that proposal was that, “no additional
allocations were made to the local government sphere”, whilst provinces
“may be able to absorb any additional costs that arise through the
demarcation”. Is this fair, and should the additional costs, if any, not
have been funded by national governments, or is this a contingency included
in the increased allocations to provinces?

Notwithstanding the above, the ACDP wishes to commend the Minister and the
Treasury. We support this Bill. I thank you.

Ms N R MOKOTO: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister of Finance, hon members and
members of the public, when the ANC leadership, together with its alliance
partners, took a conscious decision that it will engage in multiparty talks
with the apartheid regime to prepare for the democratisation of the country
and to eventually contest the elections, it was propelled by the need to
deliver a better life for all South Africans and the great saying that:


  None of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of
  resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs, the alleviation,
  and the eradication of poverty; and therefore, the struggle to eradicate
  poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national
  effort to build a new South Africa, where all human life is equal.

Our historic decision and the subsequent ascendance of the ANC to power has
consistently derived its importance from the reality that it will impact
significantly on the current situation and the future of our country and
its people. In 2005, at its national general council held in Tshwane, the
ANC sincerely declared that South Africa had reached a new phase of the
national democratic revolution. This has, therefore. meant that the
consolidation of political democracy, the growing electoral strength of and
the support for our movement, and the relative stabilisation of our economy
have created a new set of opportunities and challenges for social
transformation.

Indeed, as the ANC, we have no other option but to agree with the hon
Minister of Finance, Minister Trevor Manuel, when he expressly said: “In
the spirit of the Freedom Charter, people’s lives hold equal value”. For
the past six years, our economy has recorded a steady growth and wellbeing,
when compared to other economies around the world.

Our current budget has increased significantly since the 2004-05 financial
year, and it has continued to do so at a very exceptional rate. This has
paved ways for a phenomenal increase on the additional allocations expected
to remain at R89,5 billion over the medium-term. The additional allocation
arose as a result of major savings on the government expenditure and a
savings on the interest accumulated as a result of the low cost of
servicing debt.

It is important to note that the additional allocations are appropriated
for focused government programme areas within departments and other layers
of government only serve to augment the already existing allocations
provided in the main Budget. The additional allocations will, therefore,
address identified priorities for the government at a specified time.

We are, however, of the view that the allocations cannot be used to
substitute any form of revenue collection, especially in municipalities, an
exercise which still remains a dilemma for many of our municipalities which
still struggle to collect own revenue for self-sustenance.

I want to highlight that our government has now been provided with renewed
impetus and possibilities to introduce accelerated growth, broad-based
development with more emphasis on key government priorities like social
services, education, health, crime prevention, public sector,
infrastructure, and the much-awaited 2010 Fifa World Cup tournament.

As the ANC, we will continue to acknowledge the fact that the rapid growth
in the budgeted expenditure does pose a challenge with regard to the
capacity to utilise these amounts, particularly in the municipalities and
within certain departments, at both national and provincial levels.
Government spending patterns in most instances leaves too much to be
desired. As part of exercising our oversight roles as parliamentarians, we
have to ensure that in all, the government fully accounts on the mandate of
the people. It is important to highlight that this kind of mannerism, which
is gradually becoming a norm, can neither be tolerated nor condoned as it
continuously compromises service delivery to our people, as a consequence
of insufficient and untimely planning by certain senior managers in the
government.

However, regarding the situation, we have to acknowledge that real spending
on capital expenditure in proportion to the unspent capital funds dropped
by 8% in 2005-06 financial year from 14% in the previous financial year.
Despite this drop, we expect a much higher rate of underspending in 2006-07
financial year.

As Members of Parliament, we have taken note of the levels of seriousness
with which the government is tackling this matter. It is the view of the
ANC that the Siyenzamanje and Project Consolidate intervention programmes
jointly run by the Development Bank of South Africa and national government
in several municipalities around the country are surely and gradually
emitting positive results for the many municipalities that previously
suffered serious scarce skills shortage.

It has taken us more than a century to convince the world what a great
potential Africa holds. The initial allocations of R4,1 billion made for
the 2010 Fifa World Cup further increased with an additional of R13,3
billion for the building of stadiums and associated infrastructure. The
government, through this generous appropriation for the Fifa World Cup, has
fully reasserted its position and commitment towards the successful holding
of this tournament in a manner which was not anticipated.

We are greatly encouraged by the positive spin-offs that will arise as a
result of hosting the 2010 Fifa World Cup tournament. These benefits will
surely have an immense impact on the economic growth, job creation, youth
development, tourism and skills development in the country. This will
produce further ripple effects for the rest of the African continent.

As seasoned revolutionaries, we wish to declare that the age of hope shall
never leave our people or our continent. The ANC supports the Budget Vote.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, the Budget tabled before this
Parliament addresses the needs and concerns of a human being. The hon
Minister was spot-on to stress that ...

... motho ke motho ga a na bosetlhana.[... a human being is a human being,
there is no lesser human being.]

A human being is a human being. There is no lesser human being; whether
rich or poor, black or white, local citizen or alien, we all have common
needs. We, in the UCDP, have this philosophy ... rata motho, tlotla motho,
direla motho, rerisa motho, itshokele motho ... [love, respect, serve,
inform and be patient to a person]

... thereby meaning love, respect, serve, consult and be tolerant to a
human being. That is the legacy we left where we governed. To us, this
Budget does exactly that: for love, it shows how much it cares through the
social grants, more allocations for education; for respect, it shows that
the Minister listened and showed respect for the views of the people on
their concerns about crime, hence resources have been poured into the
protection services; for service to the people, the amount thrown into the
Fifa World Cup attests to this; and for consulting people, Trevor’s Tips
are testimony that ... motho ke motho ga a na bosetlhana [a human being is
a human being, there is no lesser human being ...] and even concerning
issues that the Minister is hard put to handling such as lobola, he has
declared that he will consult further.

The tolerant nature of the Budget is displayed in the pains taken to
address the question of pensions to avoid the situation where people work
for the better part of their active years of life, but retire and go into
poverty. The reforms proposed by this Budget would benefit the people, who
would otherwise have had no access to cost- effective retirement benefits
and eliminate unnecessary hardships among their families.

The cherry on top in this Budget is the fact that the government has come
to its senses by introducing bursaries for those who want to train as
teachers. The vast amount set aside for education is a clear example that
the government accepts that liberation without education is worthless. From
this exercise, we hope to have people who will have the necessary skills
and manage the booming economy of this country. We only hope that
government departments will use this money profitably. Thank you. [Time
expired.]

Mr M T LIKOTSI: Chairperson, the PAC wishes to acknowledge the challenging
task done by the Minister of Finance, the Treasury and the portfolio
committee in drafting the Bill before us. We hope the three spheres of
government, as beneficiaries, will prudently utilise their budget to
address the issue of poor service delivery and other related matters.

The PAC wishes to advise the Minister to exercise a firm hand and an iron
fist in the monitoring of the fiscals to prevent underspending and roll-
overs by provinces, municipalities and some national departments. Our
people must not languish in poverty, disease, and suffer due to poor
service delivery owing to inefficiency of provinces, municipalities and
some national departments. The target set to eradicate the bucket system,
the supply of water and electricity to all must be realised. This may only
be achieved if proper monitoring and control mechanisms are put in place.
Our people were promised free basic services, and that must not be
compromised by incapable and inefficient provinces, councillors and
national departments.

The PAC, further, could not understand why Mangaung local municipality is
deprived of the status of a Metro. It is 13 years into our fledging
democracy, and one of the most significant cities of our country is still
struggling to become a Metro due to unnecessary bureaucracy. A political
decision must be taken for this to happen as early as possible.

The PAC wishes to draw your attention to the most poor and disadvantaged
rural areas such as the Greater Sekhukhune in Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, and
the Eastern Cape when the revenue is shared. These provinces are at the
receiving end when it comes to issues related to provision of
infrastructure of all sorts, water, electricity, housing and sanitation.

The provinces without world-ranking stadiums must be attended to in the
future, as they are to lose a lot of revenue when projects such as the 2010
Fifa World Cup are staged in our country. The PAC supports the Bill.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Madam Chair, Minister, the Division of Revenue Bill is
anxiously awaited annually as it clearly indicates government’s intentions
and commitments to manage South Africa efficiently and rescue it from the
shackles of poverty. For that, hon Minister, we thank you very much.

We note minor changes to the percentage allocated to national, provincial
and local spheres of government. In view of the provincial allocation for
2007-08 we are pleased to see the 21,64% made to KwaZulu-Natal. Noting the
large population and challenges in this province, these funds need to be
effectively utilised to rescue its residents from poverty-stricken lives
and develop the province into a promising democracy. We further trust that
these funds shall find their way to establishing better schooling, health
facilities and transport.

The MF has expressed its concern over the crime situation. Funds need to be
speedily made available to equip our SAPS with the necessary resources,
personnel and training to address crime. Our commitment to supply
electricity to every household, provide proper sanitation and potable water
is crucial for better living. We have also had a budget that clearly spelt
out government’s commitment. We hope that this year’s Budget is one of
commitment to delivery.

The MF, however, has a concern regarding the targets we set for government
that give us directions and supply us with instruments to measure progress
and shortfalls. Our concern is the growth of needs and whether our output
to overcome the needs is sizeable enough to conquer the challenge. The MF
supports the Division of Revenue Bill.

Mr S SIMMONS: Madam Chair, the UPSA supports and commends the hon
Minister’s Finance Bill. The success of the hon Minister and his department
has become a cornerstone of government’s achievements, of late.

Die sukses en effektiewe fiskale dissipline gehandhaaf deur die Departement
van Finansies is alombekend. Die agb Minister het heelwat politieke wil
openbaar met sy toegewing ten opsigte van fondse vir die uitbreiding van
die getal polisielede, asook aanpassing van salarisse vir onderwysers.

Die UPSA is egter van mening dat hierdie stappe, alhoewel welkom, nie
naastenby die probleme van misdaadoplossing en verbeterde onderwys
aanspreek nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The success and effective fiscal discipline maintained by the Department
of Finance is widely recognised. The hon Minister displayed a great deal of
political will with his concession with regard to funds for the increase in
the number of members in the Police Service, as well as adjustments to
teachers’ salaries.

However, the UPSA is of the opinion that these steps, although welcome, do
not adequately deal with the problems of solving crime and of improving
education.]

The UPSA is of the opinion that greater emphasis should have been put on
the improvement of the competency levels of serving SAPS members and
teachers. This would culminate in SAPS members who are better equipped to
deal with criminals, and deliver the required levels of service to the
general public. So, too, should teachers face up to the challenges in our
schools. This action would be further justified by the handsome surplus
announced.

The principle of greater emphasis on the training of serving public
servants should be extended to almost all areas of the public sector to
improve the general level of service delivery. We trust that this matter of
training serving public servants will continue to enjoy the hon Minister’s
attention.

Once more, the UPSA supports the Bill. I thank you.

Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Chair, Minister, hon members, if we all accept that
human life has equal worth, as the Minister quoted Will Hutton in his
Budget Speech this year, and that we need to deepen the debate that will
result in the improved implementation of government programmes - programmes
that will ultimately deliver sustainable democracy and development - then
the sum total of the Budget and its component parts would need to be
interrogated so that we can establish whether the expectations of those of
us who want to see a South Africa that we can all be proud of are being
met.

The President’s state of the nation address and the Minister of Finance‘s
Budget Speech set government’s agenda, an agenda for debate and delivery.
How the rest of us in Parliament therefore participate in this broader
debate within each portfolio committee will determine the depth of the
debate and whether we can in fact influence government’s agenda for the
next financial year.

How we achieve national consensus, as the President recently encouraged us,
will be determined by mostly the attitude and tone of the words not lightly
spoken in this Chamber and in the portfolio committees. If we do not use
these opportunities and approach them by making progressive proposals, but
simply use them in an attempt to embarrass one another and polarise voters,
then we will not listen to one another and will lose the opportunity to
really get to know one another.

The debate will, to a large extent, be influenced and informed by the
Community Survey 2007, which will focus on 280 000 households and give them
the opportunity to have their living standards measured. With this
ideological diagnostic data, we must then find consensus on at least the
three topics the President highlighted in his state of the nation address,
social cohesion, poverty alleviation and crime prevention and its
eradication.

The PIM, therefore, looks forward to our joint efforts to influence
government so that we can affirm and express the idea that human life has
equal worth and human beings are equally entitled to political, economic
and social right, which allow them to choose a life they have reason to
live. I thank you.


                          DIVISION OF REVENUE BILL


                           (Second Reading debate)

Ms L L MABE: Chairperson, the ANC would like to congratulate the hon
Minister on the Budget that he has presented to this House. We would also
like to encourage him to do more than what he has done, and that includes
other institutions such as SA Revenue Service, which we would like to
encourage to collect more, on behalf of this country.

Chairperson, I am going to focus on the Financial and Fiscal Commission
recommendations, but I will only give examples. I just want to remind this
House that the FFC is an independent authority. It makes recommendations to
government, and then government, in its response during the budget
presentation, responds to the FFC either by agreeing or disagreeing with
the proposals of the FFC. But if the government disagrees with those
proposals, it gives reasons why they are not accepted. If they will be
considered in future, government states clearly that those proposals will
be considered in future. I wanted to clarify this one so that, as I
continue with my presentation, all of us will be moving at the same pace.

I would also like to indicate that we appreciate that relationship that the
FFC has with national government, in terms of the proposals that it makes.
We would also like to indicate to the FFC that they must continue engaging
with the portfolio committees, the select Committee and the Joint Budget
Committee.

We cannot respond to what has not been presented before the three
committees or until it appears before the three committees. In this case I
am referring to the independent public authority that was suggested or
proposed by the FFC. We will consider it in the committee and, for now, we
do not have any comment on that authority. Especially because the more
institutions we create as government, the more problems we have in terms of
how those institutions carry out their mandate and how they spend money,
for example, the Sector Education and Training Authorities that we have at
the moment.

I would like to comment on the Hospital Revitalisation Grant. We fully
agree that the grant should not be included in that provincial
infrastructure grant, because it will not achieve the intended national
priorities. In this instance, I would give an example of what happens in
Moses Kotane. For the first time, we have two hospitals running at the same
time - one in Mabeskraal and the other in Ledig. They were constructed at
the same time, and this is unprecedented. I would want to say that if we
maintain the separate grants, then we are sure that the provincial
government would not take the money that was allocated at national level
for the construction of those hospitals and utilise it elsewhere.

I would also refer to the Land Care and Comprehensive Agriculture Support
Grant. We support the fact that they cannot be merged because the time is
not yet ripe for the two to be merged, and will not be until such time that
we are sure that the provinces will utilise the grant for what it is
intended for, especially the Land Care and the Comprehensive Agriculture
Support Grants. They will lose the meaning if we combine the two before we
achieve our objectives.

Regarding the National Housing Allocation, we request National Treasury to
consider the fact that construction costs in different provinces and in
different municipalities are not the same and it will create problems if
allocations are based on particular regional conditions. For example, in
Rustenburg the price of building materials is not the same as in Koster, in
Kgetleng Municipality. But Kgetleng Municipality orders its building
materials from Rustenburg. So, how will you be able to control such price
differences? It becomes difficult and that is why, for now, we are saying,
let us not allocate according to different regional price fluctuations,
because it is going to create serious problems for the municipalities to
make proposals or to present estimations to the national government.

Concerning grants in general, we want to make a plea to the national
departments: Please use your responsibilities to monitor the grants in the
provinces and at local government level. It seems that the national
departments are absconding from their responsibility and they are putting
the whole responsibility on National Treasury. This is uncalled for,
because they are the ones who bid for these grants and receive plans from
the provinces and the municipalities.

Therefore, they must take the responsibility to monitor those grants,
whether construction is taking place or whether the conditions are being
implemented through monthly and quarterly reports.

Unfortunately, some of the national departments do not monitor those
grants. They leave the monitoring either to the province or to the National
Treasury, whereas they are the ones who dispense. The Division of Revenue
Act is clear that the national dispensing departments must monitor and be
accountable as accounting officers.

I would also like to indicate that we really appreciate the fact that, over
the medium term, allocation for grants will increase to a greater degree.
This shows that the government is committed to ensuring that infrastructure
development is given priority. But, as I have indicated earlier on, the
department must take responsibility because we do not want to see protests
from time to time, with people saying there is no delivery on the ground,
but where national departments have failed to fulfil their responsibility.

I would like, in this instance, to give an example of the health
department. The Auditor-General, in his reports of 2005-06, reported that
payments of R1,3 billion were made prior to approval of business plans. How
can a national department make divestment to provinces when plans have not
yet been approved? At the same time, the Auditor-General raised the fact
that the amount of R110 million is more than the amount approved in the
individual business plans.

How can you dispense that amount of money without looking at the business
plans? The departments cannot expert the National Treasury to come and do
monitoring on their behalf. They are the ones who dispense, and they must
also be in a position to monitor, and make sure that they guide the
provinces.

It is the imperative of the national department to take the initiative
concerning intervention measures, because, as a national department, you
are the accounting officer and you must ensure that the provinces and local
governments utilise funds according to national priorities. Also, regarding
quarterly report and quarterly visits, we urge the departments, and we are
going to call them at a later stage to find out what they are doing, to
monitor on monthly and quarterly bases, to tell us what is happening on the
ground, and whether those grants are being utilised for what they are
intended, but, at the same time, to know which projects are at a stalemate
and which ones are at an advanced stage, and again to know which projects
will not be achieved in that particular year. It is important for us to
know, as Parliament, but, like I say, we are going to make follow up on
such issues during the course of the year.

We would like to welcome the fact that the national government has
established an intervention task team, which is referred to as the
Infrastructure Delivery Improvement Programme. This intervention strategy
is good, in the sense that we have seen a change in spending on
infrastructure for education. We have also seen an improvement in housing.
Although housing has been one of the victims of underspending in
infrastructure, but, at least, for now, for the last three quarters, there
has been an improvement in this intervention. That is why we are calling on
the national departments to do the same, not to wait for the National
Treasury. They must take that initiative.

I would also want to remind this House that the President announced in his
state of nation address two years ago that no learner will learn under a
tree. That issue has been a concern to us as the ANC, but if it was not
because of this intervention, up to now we would still be having question
marks of how many classrooms or how many learners are still learning under
trees. This intervention has speeded up the process of building more
additional classrooms, and, like I say, I presume that it is the same
intervention that has improved capital spending in housing.

We would also like to welcome the new grant on community library services.
We are a nation that has to learn and read. I thought Minister Pallo Jordan
would be here, so that he would be made aware that we are going to have an
interest in seeing whether the department has plans. What are they going to
do throughout the course of the year to ensure that there will be no
fund–shifting at the end of the financial year or that during the MTBPS
there shall be no shifting of funds?

We expected that by now they ought to be having plans of how they are going
to implement that grant, because people want to consult through using
libraries. People want libraries to be up to date in terms of the services
they offer to them.

I would also like to finally indicate to the Minister of Finance that today
South Africa is financially where nobody ever dreamt it will be.
[Applause.] When you took over in 1996, there were Messiahs who could
foretell that a Minister from the ANC could not do anything good. And we
have proved them wrong. I want to congratulate you and your staff. Even
those institutions that are under your administration or your control have
done an excellent job. The ANC supports the Bill. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I would like to express my
appreciation to all parties in the House, because it’s clear that everybody
supports the Division of Revenue Bill, but let me deal with some of the
issues that have been raised. Firstly, regarding the support expressed by
the hon Davidson for an independent body doing the micro forecast, we
recently undertook an interesting exercise where we looked at trends in
respect of this consensus forecast. There are two groups of consensus
forecasts by private sector economists: one is run by Reuters and the other
by Beeld.

We looked at our own forecast over the past few years and, just yesterday,
the GDP growth for last year was announced as at 5% year on year. The Beeld
consensus was 4,05% for last year and the Reuters consensus was 4,05% while
ours was 4,9%. In the previous year, where growth was 5,1%, the Beeld
consensus was 4,1% and the Reuters was 4,0%. Treasury was marginally better
at 4,3% but less strong.

Now, if you go back over the history of the last decade you will find the
same trends. I think the observation that we can make is that whilst
Treasury may have been wrong, we were significantly less wrong than these
consensus forecasts. There is a very important point here, because if you
take this responsibility and hand it over, where is responsibility for this
vested?

I am saying it’s an intensely political function. We take responsibility;
we will stand before this House and debate the issues. But, to hand this
thing over to some other institution out there and believe that they would
be the determinant of the forecast on which we must put the premise of
fiscal framework to allocate resources, is probably taking the economic
functions of government into some kind of belief system where you leave it
all to automatons. There is no government in the world that operates like
that, and that is the first problem I have with it. [Applause.]
In respect of the tax to GDP ratio, I would like to leave that and perhaps
when we have the Budget debate, we can give a bit more attention to that.
Regarding the support expressed, again, by the hon Davidson for the
operation and maintenance costs, let’s firstly explain that when we use
conditional grants, we use them in order to try and influence another
sphere of government in respect of national priorities. Therefore, if you
look at the local government and go through the list, you will find that
there are grants that would support the eradication of the bucket system,
water, sanitation and electricity; and then from the equitable share,
financing for free basic services.

If you fail to understand that there are limitations in respect of the
different functions, you are running the risk that the hon Mokoto raised,
namely that you then open a huge moral hazard, because municipalities don’t
have to collect the revenue that they must collect, because somebody else
is going to do it for them. Operation and maintenance costs are key to what
municipalities ought to do, and whilst it is also something that the
national level must do, to do it through conditional grants is not entirely
rational.

Regarding the hon Swart and the demarcation, there is an issue that arose
in the past few days. As luck would have it, in the area of Moutse which is
now part of Limpopo province, somehow there was a miscalculation and
teachers have been taxed twice and thus they are in uproar. They believe
that you pay more tax in Limpopo. It is something that we will resolve
together with the government of Limpopo in the next 48 hours, but these
kinds of things happen.

We think that provinces are adequately resourced to deal with the changes.
We have calculated this very carefully and we have been in very close
consultation with them. So, there are no real additional costs. There is an
endeavour to hide costs or to recalibrate the costs in some way where it’s
clearly unaffordable, but I think we are on top of that.

About issues raised by the hon Likotsi, monitoring and control are issues
that are part of political oversight. Don’t leave it to the Treasury. Our
constituency officers should be doing a lot more of this and we must defend
the rights and the responsibilities of Members of Parliament to be part of
that monitoring and oversight, ensuring that the IDPs are there and are
linked to provincial growth and development plans, and that the money is
spent as planned.

This Parliament should be a repository of all that information, so that
monitoring and evaluation of the money that we allocate would be much
better. Democracy would be better served because all Members of Parliament
would be involved in the process. Thank you very much for the support from
all parties. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises on the South
      African Airways Bill [B35-2006] (National Assembly – sec 75), dated 28
      February 2007:


      The Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, having considered the
      subject of the South African Airways Bill [B35-2006] (National
      Assembly- sec 75), referred to it and classified by the Joint Tagging
      Mechanism as a section 75 Bill, reports the Bill with Amendments [B35A-
      2006].


      The Committee further reports as follows:


        1. The Committee is acutely aware of the financial and other
           strategic challenges confronting SAA and the need for this Bill.


        2. Consistent with the government’s new emerging shareholder
           management model and the Committee’s views on this, the
           Committee decided to effect amendments to the Bill that would
           provide for:


    • A Preamble to convey the sense of SAA as a national carrier and
      strategic asset.
    • The strategic role that SAA plays.
               • The need for the Minister to account to Parliament for any
                 major changes in SAA’s role and decisions about converting
                 SAA into a public company.
        3. The Committee believes that the temperate amendments it proposed
           would not discourage potential investors or unduly bind the
           Minister.


        4. The Minister for Public Enterprises, Mr Alec Erwin, stressed
           that he agrees with the amendments proposed but explained that
           it would be more appropriate to provide for them in the
           forthcoming Shareholder Management Bill.  A key reason for this
           is that the provisions that the Committee wants in regards to
           SAA apply to state-owned entities generally.  In a letter to the
           Committee, the Minister said “….with respect to the
           recommendation to involve Parliament in the decision to convert
           SAA into a public company, the Department is in the process of
           drafting legislation to regulate State-Owned Enterprises (SOE)
           such as SAA. This SOE legislation will facilitate a role for
           Parliament in the formation and change in status of any SOE. I
           believe this will accommodate the important point made by the
           Committee that if an enterprise is strategic enough that we
           bring the matter to Parliament, then surely Parliament should
           have some role if that status is changed. Our intention is to
           bring this piece of legislation to the Committee in the second
           half of this year.” Of course, the “recommendation” the Minister
           refers to is a proposed “amendment” – but the Committee
           recognises the value of what the Minister proposes and accepts
           it. However, consistent with paragraph 2 and what is set out in
           this paragraph, we have effected the Preamble referred to above.


        5. The Minister said that the Shareholder Management Bill will
           provide for each SOE to have a Charter that sets out its
           strategic role. Any major change to this Charter would be
           brought to Parliament.

        6. The Minister said that he would explain his intention to provide
           for the measures in the pending Shareholder Management Bill
           during the debate in the National Assembly on the SAA Bill.


        7. The Committee agrees that the amendments it proposes to the SAA
           Bill are better addressed in the pending Shareholder Management
           Bill and will attend to this in the processing of that Bill.


        8. Of course, the Committee recognises the volatility of the
           airline industry and SAA’s vulnerabilities, and the government
           may need to act swiftly, but the Committee believes that any
           major changes to SAA relating to the issues dealt with in this
           Bill should, ideally, take place after the Shareholder
           Management Bill is passed.  If this is not possible, the
           Minister should inform Parliament of major decisions taken in
           terms of the SAA Bill.
           Report to be considered.
