MINISTERS:

        Outcome of inquiry into alleged blacklisting of commentators

  55. Ms M Smuts (DA) asked the Minister of Communications:

      Whether the Chief Executive Officer of the SA Broadcasting Corporation
      announced at the conclusion of the inquiry into the alleged
      blacklisting of commentators that the inquiry had shown that there was
      a "case to answer" by both a certain announcer (name furnished) and a
      certain news MD (name furnished) and that both would be submitted to
      disciplinary proceedings; if so, (a) what steps have been taken in
      this regard and (b) what was the outcome in each case?
                             N354E


The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS (On behalf of the Minister): Madam
Speaker, we must express an apology on behalf of the Minister, who was
unable to be here.

The response to the question posed by hon member Ms Smuts is as follows.
The Group CEO of the SABC tabled the findings of the Sisulu commission to
the SABC Board. After deliberating on the matter, the SABC Board decided in
the case of announcer Mr John Perlman, that he should be counselled by the
Group CEO and cautioned that if he aired organisational issues again in
public, without exhausting internal remedies, sterner action would be
taken. Effectively what was meant by sterner action was that there would be
a combination of counselling and a verbal warning.

In the case of Group Executive of News and Current affairs, Dr Snuki
Zikalala, the board decided that he should be given a verbal warning,
jointly by the Group CEO and the chairman of the board, in respect of some
of the issues raised in the Sisulu commission report, which were indeed
serious and certainly unacceptable to the board, that he be instructed to
co-operate in the remedial steps that were recommended by the commission
and that he be warned that should the conduct in question be found to occur
in future, stronger action would be taken.

Both these actions were duly and separately conveyed to the two employees
in November 2006.

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, would the hon the Deputy Minister agree that
what he has just described is not even a mild rebuke towards Mr Zikalala
and that, in fact, any pretence at disciplinary proceedings against him was
pre-judged when the SABC Board expressed its full confidence in him the day
before it announced that disciplinary steps would occur against both Mr
Perlman and Mr Zikalala?

Whereas, does he not agree that there are, in fact, grounds for dismissal
of Mr Zikalala in the findings of the inquiry to the effect that he
practiced the arbitrary and improper exclusion of individual commentators
and that this impermissibly narrowed the range of use available to South
Africans? That is a clear infringement of the SABC’s editorial policy, if
not the law. If those are not grounds for dismissal, I don’t know what it
is.

In the circumstances, would you not agree that this issue has been,
firstly, pre-judged, and, secondly, that what has been delivered to Mr
Zikalala is the mildest of rebukes, whereas we have lost Mr Perlman, who
has gone down for doing his professional duty? [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Speaker, I think that we do
have a fundamental problem in dealing with this issue, and this is that the
hon member of the opposition - and I have made this comment before - has
consistently made statements concerning the SABC that purport to interfere
in terms of the internal management processes of the SABC. [Interjections.]
She always accuses the executive and the Minister, in particular, that the
Minister should not interfere in the internal affairs of the SABC, yet she
does.

I think that we are governed by the principle that what happens inside the
SABC is a matter for the SABC Board, and the board has to decide in its
wisdom and it is the Board to which Parliament entrusts the management of
the SABC. The members of the SABC Board are not selected by the Minister.
The members of the board are selected by this Parliament. [Interjections.]
They are the public custodians of the right to good expression in that
institution, and they certainly are accountable for the management of the
internal processes of the board.

So it would be entirely incorrect for the Minister or me - or any one of us
in government - to make a value judgment on the correctness or
incorrectness of the kind of disciplinary measures that the board has
chosen to adopt in view of the fact that it has the benefit of a commission
that thoroughly investigated the matter and made certain recommendations.
On top of it all, the SABC is on record as having said that it has accepted
all the recommendations of the commission and that, indeed, has acted on
them.

In the case of Mr John Perlman himself, I think that none of us has a point
of difference on the quality of that particular journalist; on the
integrity of that journalist and on the value that he brings to the public
broadcaster. We are very, very clear about that. The fact that he has been
lost to the SABC is something that one should not be gleeful about. I think
it is sad that we had to lose a respected journalist of that calibre, but
unfortunately the situation we have before us is that he chose to resign,
and so we have lost him. That is a fact that is delivered to us. It is his
choice. It was not the desire of the SABC Board that he should have
resigned, but he chose to do so, because of his own position in that he
would be better off doing something different.

On the matter of Mr Snuki Zikalala, the SABC Board was very, very clear
that it would not countenance such conduct again; regarding the conduct the
commission made statements on. I think that, at best, we should leave it at
that and not interfere in the internal processes of the management of the
board as we have the greatest respect for their integrity and to which
Parliament has given the right to manage that institution to benefit our
people. Thank you. [Applause.]
Mr K K KHUMALO: Madam Speaker, Parliament appoints the board of the SA
Broadcasting Corporation through the Portfolio Committee on Communication.
The recommendations of the Sisulu commission will also be tabled again for
a second time before the Portfolio Committee on Communication on 16 March
2007. What is fundamental is the fact that freedom of expression has not
been violated by this particular recommendation. Secondly, the multiplicity
of views is also contained in terms of what the corporation is supposed to
be doing.

What I need to check with you, Deputy Minister, is whether in terms of the
recommendations there has been any corporate governance violation.
Secondly, has the corporation suffered when it comes to this fundamental
independence in terms of freedom of expression and the multiplicity of
views? As far as we are concerned, as the ANC, we think that that is more
serious than what the opposition is raising. Thank you, Madam Speaker.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Speaker, I can only but agree
with the hon member that we have to respect the integrity of the management
processes of the SABC Board. We have put them there on the board to do a
job, and we must give them the right and freedom to do what they think is
necessary. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnu V B NDLOVU: Somlomo, mhlonishwa Phini likaNgqongqoshe Wezokuxhumana,
umbuzo wokuqala uthi, ngabe ibhodi yamncoma yini uZikalala ngaphambi
kokuthi imphenye? Owesibili umbuzo uthi, uthini umhlonishwa uma ethi
uphenyo luthole ukuthi “possibly” kungaba uyena? [Ubuwelewele.] Impela
ngikhuluma naye umhlonishwa. [Ubuwelewele.] Ngabe akezwa ukuthi ngithini?
Somlomo ngibona sengathi umhlonishwa iPhini likaNgongqoshe unenkinga ...
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy Minister  of  Communications,  the
first question is, did the board express confidence in  Mr  Zikalala  before
investigating him?  The  second  question  is,  what  does  the  hon  Deputy
Minister mean when he says, "the investigation found out that 'possibly'  it
might be him"? [Interjections.] Yes, I am  definitely  talking  to  the  hon
Deputy Minister. [Interjections.] Doesn’t he understand what  I  am  saying?
Madam Speaker, it seems like the hon Deputy Minister has a problem ...]

The SPEAKER: Let’s give him half a minute to ensure  that  he  can  be  with
you.

Mnu  V  B  NDLOVU:  Ngiyabonga,  Somlomo.  Umbuzo  wokuqala  ubuthe:  Ibhodi
ayizange imncome yini uMnu Zikalala  ngaphambi  kokuthi  imphenye;  ayizange
isho yini ukuthi uziphethe kahle futhi ungumuntu okahle  owaziyo  umsebenzi?
Owesibili  umbuzo  uthi,  njengoba  ngizwe  umhlonishwa   ephendula   ilungu
elihloniphekile uNk Dene Smuts,  lapho  ethe  uphenyo  lwathola  ukuthi  ku-
“possible” ukuthi uMnu Zikalala wakwenza lokho, u-“possible” lo  kanti  usho
ukuthini ngempela? Ngabe  usho  ukuthi  wakwenza  noma  akakwenzanga  lokho?
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr V B NDLOVU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The first question  was:  Did  the
board express confidence in Mr Zikalala before investigating  him?  Did  the
board say his behaviour is good and he is somebody who knows  the  job?  The
second question is as a result of the response that the hon Deputy  Minister
gave to the hon member, Ms Dene Smuts, when he said the investigation  found
that it was “possible” that Mr Zikalala had done that. What does  “possible”
really mean? Does it mean that he had or had not done that?]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Speaker, let me just  apologise
to the hon member, because I was struggling with the microphone here  and  I
was unable to listen earlier on.

Let me just say that the board decided that he  should  be  given  a  verbal
warning, jointly by the Group CEO and the chairman of the  board.  Also,  it
does appear from that particular decision that the board found it  necessary
to caution Mr Zikalala on some of his  actions  and,  therefore,  took  that
decision. So, it cannot be that the board had  condoned  this  conduct  that
the commission found, in practice, might have been  unacceptable.  So,  it’s
clear from the reply of the SABC Board that they found those aspects of  the
conduct unacceptable and objectionable, and, therefore,  sought  to  caution
Mr Zikalala.

The matter about whether the  board  expressed  confidence  in  Mr  Zikalala
before  they  had  adjudicated  on  the  report  of   the   commission   ...
[Interjections.]

Ms M SMUTS: On 12 October.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: I think, again, you are dealing  with
an internal management issue, because if you were sitting  on  a  management
board and  one  of  your  employees  was  being  criticised  for  particular
conduct, the subject of which a commission of inquiry had been  specifically
appointed to look into the details, surely it would be improper for  you  to
go out and say that you had no confidence  in  your  employee,  even  before
that commission had conveyed its findings?

The SABC Board has to have confidence in its  employees,  and  until  it  is
proven that their conduct has been such that it warrants  some  disciplinary
action, it has to take the position that it has confidence in the  staff  it
has employed. Mr Zikalala is not a junior member of staff; he  is  a  senior
employee of the organisation. [Interjections.] There  is  nothing  wrong  in
expressing confidence. But, certainly, we would not respond the same if  the
commission had found that some of his conduct was unacceptable and then  the
SABC Board went on to say: “No, no, despite that, we still have the  fullest
confidence in him.”

Instead they  sought  to  correct  that  aspect  of  his  conduct  that  was
unacceptable. We must remember that  what  the  commission  found  was  that
there was no policy on the part of the SABC Board that  said  that  some  of
these commentators should not be brought before the board. There is no  such
policy, but there may have been an error in the practice. That is  where  Mr
Zikalala was cautioned. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: To the hon Deputy Minister: Is it the case - yes or no - that
the Department of Communications, upon publication by the Sowetan of
allegations that four commentators at that stage were being blacklisted,
sent a request to the SABC saying: “Now, kindly advise us, is this
blacklisting occurring: yes or no; if so, why?”

I consider that proper conduct, and I am responding to his nonsensical
allegations of interference. You yourself prompted this inquiry. The
department sent that question. The SABC responded in the form of a
statement which was misleading, found so by the inquiry. Mr Perlman
contradicted that statement, and the rest is now history.

It was, in fact, the perfectly proper inquiry by your own department as to
the existence or otherwise of blacklisting that led to the inquiry – which
was an excellent thing – that has told us that there was censorship at the
SABC and that now leaves us in a situation in which the people who
practised this censorship are still there, and those who revealed it have
gone.

The SPEAKER: Hon Smuts, you’ve run out of your minute and you haven’t asked
a question. I didn’t hear a question there, but if the hon Deputy Minister
wants to say something, please go ahead.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Speaker, I don’t see the
question in that statement. [Interjections.] I think the hon member is
trying to suggest that it is the Department of Communications that
initiated this inquiry.

Now, the hon member entrusts the department with the responsibility of
oversight over this institution.

Ms M SMUTS: I don’t! Absolutely not.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: If you don’t, then why do you ask us
the question? I think because we feel compelled ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Smuts, please take your seat and let the Deputy Minister
finish.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: If there is a public statement about
an institution that falls under our governance on the allegations that
emerged in the particular article that she referred to, I think it is the
right of the Minister to ask the board if there is any truth in the
allegation.

Ms M SMUTS: I agree.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: You do agree with that. Then, that
is what may have been done in this particular instance. So, if you agree
with that, then I can’t see the reason for your question. Thank you.

       Position of Department of Education on mother-tongue education

37.   Adv A H Gaum (ANC) asked the Minister of Education:

      What is her department’s position with regard to mother-tongue
      education, with specific reference to a certain high school (name
      furnished)?
      N336E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The reply is as
follows. The department’s policy on language in education encourages
learners to choose to learn in their mother tongue. Learners in public
schools - and by that, really, in brackets we might put parents - have a
right to choose any of the 11 official languages as a language of learning
and teaching and as a subject from Grade 3 onwards.

We also have in the policy the intention of promoting the increased
learning and utilisation of the indigenous previously neglected languages
of South Africa. The department, therefore, in its policy encourages all
learners to have studied an African language for three years by the end of
Grade 9. This particular aspect is taking a long time to be taken up by our
various provinces, but I am pleased that the Limpopo province and the
Western Cape have indeed acted in this particular area of policy.

On the matter of the high school whose name the member furnished to me, the
matter, given that there is a ruling pending, is sub judice. I will – and
offer to the member - come back to address the House on this matter once
the case is finalised. All I can say to the hon member is that as far as I
am aware at this time learners in that school continue to be taught in a
language of their choice.

Adv A H GAUM: Thank you, Speaker. Minister, in a multicultural society
parallel-medium schools can contribute towards nation-building. However,
these schools require much more physical and human resources than single-
medium schools to function properly and to prevent the situation in which
they are forced to become single-medium English institutions.

Firstly, is the Minister willing to provide the substantial additional
resources required to encourage schools to become and to stay parallel-
medium institutions? Secondly, were the steps taken against the Ermelo
school worthwhile in view of the fact that with the first quarter almost at
its end only 19 learners requiring education in English have applied to be
admitted to this school? Also, would the Minister regard it to be
reasonably practicable for a school, in terms of the Constitution, to
provide education in the official language of choice to only 19 learners
and not the 113 that were originally mentioned? Thirdly, under which
circumstances would the Minister support the establishment and continued
existence under the Constitution of single-medium Afrikaans schools? Thank
you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I will not reply to the
particular matters with respect to the school. As I have said, I will come
back to it once the matter has been concluded and we have the judge’s
ruling.

With respect to the matter of parallel-medium schools, it is, of course,
not the Minister of Education who provides resources for schools, but
provinces that have the funds allocated to them by their provincial
treasuries and they determine the allocation. Of course, they should ensure
that schools have sufficient resources to teach children in our schools
adequately, as well as learning and teaching support materials.

As far as I am aware, every person who studied teaching up to the year 2005
actually anticipated, in the degree that they took, that they would be
bilingual in terms of their ability to teach. So, the notion that a
multilingual student body somehow is an impediment to the ability to teach
is not confirmed by the reality of the qualifications offered by our
universities. So, clearly, greater resources: yes; but also full
utilisation of all educators available to the children of South Africa.

With respect to the realisation of single-medium schools, of course, our
Constitution says that where practicable this should be allowed for and
supported, and it does occur in many schools where there are significant
numbers of children who choose a single language as their medium. Indeed,
they are able to continue with their education.

However, when you have a context in which there may be children who have
the right to education, you then have to look at how you weigh this and
integrate it with the correct constitutional provision concerning the
provision of single-medium schools. So, in terms of the children’s right to
education, surely the hon member would agree, cannot be trumped by the
provision which relies on reasonable practicability. Thank you.

Mev D VAN DER WALT: Agb Speaker, ek gaan my vraag in Afrikaans aan die
Minister vra. U, Minister, is geboekstaaf dat u ten gunste van
moedertaalonderrig is en ook veeltaligheid ondersteun. Indien so, watter
aksies het u departement geneem om moedertaalonderrig, ongeag of dit Sotho,
Venda, Xhosa, Zulu of enige een van ons ander amptelike tale is, werklik
tot op datum te implementeer? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mrs D VAN DER WALT: Hon Speaker, I am going to put my question to the
Minister in Afrikaans. Minister, you are on record that you are in favour
of mother-tongue education and that you also support multilingualism. If
this is the case, what steps have your department taken to date to really
implement mother-tongue education, irrespective of whether it is Sotho,
Venda, Xhosa, Zulu or any of our other official languages?]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, as I have attempted to indicate
to members with respect to the school level in South Africa, the provision
of resources for the implementation of a national policy, which sets a
national norm and standard, depends on action by provinces. I made
reference to two provinces which have already taken action with respect to
what the member called vernacular languages, the indigenous languages of
black persons in this country.

Limpopo as well as the Western Cape have provided support for the teaching
of IsiXhosa in the Western Cape, and Sepedi and Sesotho in the Limpopo
province. So, we have positive action there. And, of course, I shouldn’t
forget KwaZulu-Natal; my colleague there would be very angry, because
IsiZulu is also being offered to young people in that province. So, there
has been action.

The next layer is, of course, higher education, and there it is entirely my
responsibility. With respect to that, there are institutions that offer
dual-medium teaching. There, what we have done, with the support of vice
chancellors, is to begin to calculate the cost of adding a language of
teaching to the university. From our side, we are going to be providing
additional resources from the new financial year to support universities in
implementing this dual-medium policy or multilingual policies. These are
still new steps that are being taken by higher education institutions in
our country, but we are committed to ensuring that we do support them.

Our reliance, however, in the final analysis, is on what the schools do,
and, if the schools have respect for the development of a multilingual
character in our schools, then certainly the higher levels of education
would also develop such an approach.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Hon Minister, mother-tongue
education may prove to be very disempowering in the end in the sense that
the economy and, in fact, all other means of production, are still to a
very large extent controlled by both English and Afrikaans-speaking
sections of our population.

The question is: Does the Minister envisage a time when companies and other
businesses may be asked or compelled to include in their correspondence
African languages, including interviews, so that those who might have been
taught in their mother tongue compete successfully? I thank you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, it is important for me to
indicate, through you to the hon member, that it is not my belief that
education in the mother tongue should be access to one language only. Our
policy encourages multilingualism and, therefore, proficiency in a language
other than the one which is your mother tongue is in my view absolutely
important.

The notion, which all of us are propounding, that somehow if we use our
mother tongue we are competing with English merely shows how colonised we
are intellectually. The Afrikaans-speaking community in South Africa was
able to wield power utilising Afrikaans.

Why would it be impossible not to wield power, because we don’t want to
repeat some of those negatives - and I’ve posed this in the public domain -
for our intellectuals, who are schooled in language development through
Afrikaans development, to assist in the further development of other
languages in this country? When did the Afrikaner become afraid of the
English, I ask?

So, hon member, the use of the mother tongue doesn’t mean drowning in
English; it means acquisition of the opportunity for full cognitive
development alongside acquisition of other languages that are available,
both in our society and worldwide. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Hon Minister, the ACDP believes
that children who begin their education in their mother tongue make a
better start and continue to perform better than those for whom school
starts with a new language.

A practical problem we are anticipating is that some languages do not have
the range of vocabulary and concepts to be useful beyond the early stages
of schooling without additional qualifications. In view of this, what will
the government do to ensure that children do not spend more time learning
newly invented words than learning the subject at hand? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, it is possible to develop
vocabulary, and it has been done worldwide. In fact, the proven research
findings that the Rev Meshoe now claims as the ACDP’s knowledge do, in
fact, indicate that it is better for children to begin in their mother
tongue.

This notion began from Rousseau right through to researchers today, so well
before the time of the ACDP, and the ACDP should not claim it as their
knowledge.
You develop concepts. Language grows through utilisation in a range of
settings. Language adapts. “Coup de grâce״ is French, but it is used in the
Oxford English Dictionary as part of English expression. So, the notion
that language is some immutable thing in society is absolutely wrong.

In Setswana, you speak of electricity as “motlaxase”. How do you explain
how you got to that particular conception? So language is able to grow;
it’s able to be developed. The way you do this is through your higher
education institutions which need to be dynamically evolved in the process
of developing these languages which have previously been neglected.

We are working with teachers, for example, in pursuit of our mother- tongue
beginning policy to write material for children from native speakers of the
languages, and we are publishing these materials with the assistance of the
United States Agency for International Development, and placing them in our
foundation classes so that our children have access to material which is
drawn from people who are actually competent in the languages that we
intend our young children to use.

So, work is being done, and you use the speakers of the language and your
academics to assist you in developing the concepts, the vocabulary and the
methodology. [Applause.]

    Adequacy of institutional and human resource funding arrangements for
                         understaffed municipalities

73.   Mr P F Smith (IFP) asked the Minister for Provincial and Local
      Government:

      Whether, with regard to the research conducted by the Municipal
      Demarcation Board (details furnished), institutional and human
      resource funding arrangements for understaffed municipalities are
      adequate for them to perform their developmental obligations and to
      properly service their residents; if not, what has the government done
      or what does it intend doing to address this matter; if so, what are
      the relevant details?  N374E

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Speaker, the
answer to the question from the hon Smith is as follows. The Ministry and
department have taken note of the research conducted by the Municipal
Demarcation Board into this matter. The challenges and issues they have
identified continue to feature in our deliberations relating to the
capacitation of the local government sphere and to structuring of the
equitable share.

Currently, from a funding perspective, municipalities are funded from a
subsidy sourced through the institutional support component of the local
government equitable share. The subsidy supplements the funding of a
municipality for administration and governance costs, including the cost of
councillors’ allowances for their legislative and oversight roles.

However, the subsidy does not fully fund the entire administrative and
governance costs of a municipality, as these are considered to be the
primary responsibility of each municipality. Institutional support, through
the administration of each municipality and that over and above the base
costs, caused administration and governance to go up in terms of the size
of the population.

Municipalities, on the other hand, are also assisted financially from the
national fiscus through the municipal systems improvement grant, which is
meant to augment institutional assistance and capacity.

Lastly, these mechanisms are meant to assist all the municipalities in view
of the low revenue base within some municipalities. It will take some time
before the ratios are brought down to acceptable levels. Steps are being
taken to improve the revenue base through, for example local economic
development initiatives.

Mr P F SMITH: Thank you, Speaker. Thank you, Deputy Minister. For the
benefit of colleagues here who don’t understand what the question is,
because the figures have been taken out unilaterally by Parliament, let me
say that the board’s figures are the following. If you look at municipal
staff as a ratio to the number of households in a municipality, the average
nationally is one staff member serving just over 2 000 households in a
municipality. But this varies from 1 to 200 households to 1 to over 10 000
households.

We think that’s a completely untenable situation. In fact, if you apply the
same sort of logic to, say, education - I don’t know what the exact figures
are – a staff:learner ratio of 1:30 is the norm, but in one school year you
had 1:1, while in another school year you 1:1 000, you would have a crisis
on your hands. You’d have parents and pupils marching to get this remedied.

But, for some reason, for local government we seem to think it is
acceptable. There is an institutional component – it is true - in the
equitable share formula, but it does not solve the problem for these
municipalities.

So, my question is: Is it true that there are no norms and standards
governing this matter at all from the national government; and, if that is
true, what does government intend doing about it?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Firstly, we have
to acknowledge, as a department, the work of the demarcation board.
Secondly, there are financial programmes to assist and capacitate the
affected municipalities. What we also have is many grants that we give to
municipalities, and different programmes. We have those grants. What we are
saying is that the process is still taking place, and we need to be patient
with the process being run by the demarcation board. Thank you.

Mr W P DOMAN: Madam Speaker, the demarcation board also pointed out that
the municipalities were failing to appoint officials to serve the public.
That’s why you get this big ratio. They found that they had underspent on
their salary budgets, although those salary budgets are restricted to 35%
of operational expenditure.

I want to ask the hon Deputy Minister: Doesn’t she agree that these
municipalities are failing South Africans by not appointing these officials
and are often using this money on other luxuries like mayoral cars and
overseas trips?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Speaker, I
fail to understand, because through Project Consolidate, the department had
actually tried its best to make these interventions.

What we have also done as a department was to identify and call for experts
in the various fields, like engineering, to come in and assist local
government with their capacity problems. What we are saying is that it is
not true that nothing is happening at local government level. There are
those skills. There are many retired engineers that we have called in, and
recently we had 99 students trained to assist and make these necessary
interventions at local government level.

It is not true that nothing is being done about the officials. There are
training programmes that are taking place in order to assist with this
intervention and to capacitate municipalities.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Hon Deputy Minister, concerns that municipalities risk losing
gains of stability and service delivery are contained in a report by
engineers seconded to struggling municipalities. With many of the posts
vacant, the project engineers found that there were no full-time staff to
mentor, and that they were forced to do many of the projects themselves
instead of transferring the skills.

As the report advises, will government urgently review its salary structure
to avoid a situation of training staff simply to lose them to the private
sector? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Hon member, I’d
like to say that we have learnt key lessons. I don’t recall having that
report by these deployed engineers, because they are accountable to us.
We’ve identified them; they did not identify themselves. Therefore, any
report would come to us, instead of going just to the public. This is so
that we can make a proper assessment as to whether these interventions are
in fact working.

The lesson we’ve learned is that at local government level there’s a
possibility that urgent attention should be given to the following areas in
sustainable infrastructure development: the appointment of senior municipal
personnel; the development of appropriate and meaningful technical
organisational structures; the development of flexible and appropriate
compensation systems for technical personnel and improvement in revenue
management. We promise that we will get there with these identified
professionals.

Mr I D MOGASE: Madam Speaker, today South Africa is the toast of Africa and
the world. The building industry is booming and the investors are
optimistic. But despite challenges in service delivery, many areas
throughout the country are experiencing development and service delivery.

My follow-up question to the hon Deputy Minister is: Is the Deputy Minister
satisfied with the majority of local economic development strategies
adopted by municipalities in terms of their alignment and consistency with
municipal integrated development plans? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Speaker, it
is not for us to decide whether the local economic strategies at local
level are the correct ones. What happens is that these go into local areas
and the people on the ground themselves decide what the best strategies
are. It is through the IDPs that the decision is taken, and that particular
municipality then agrees with the strategy. But we can’t actually decide
for the municipalities.

  Ability of Public Service to strengthen democracy in accelerating service
                                  delivery

  42. Mr A J Nyambi (ANC) asked the Minister for the Public Service and
      Administration:


      Whether the Public Service is in good stead to drive the agenda to
      strengthen democracy in accelerating service delivery; if not, what
      are the challenges in this regard; if so, what are the relevant
      details?                                                      N341E

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker, I’d
like to thank the questioner for the particular question that’s before us.

I think first and foremost it’s necessary to say that since 1994 we’ve
prioritised transforming Public Service delivery, and this is reflected in
the Batho Pele White Paper of 1997. The White Paper says:

   ... a transformed South African Public Service will be judged by one
   criterion above all: its effectiveness in delivering services which meet
   the basic needs of all South African citizens. Public services are not a
   privilege ... they are an ... expectation.

So, clearly, improving service delivery is the ultimate goal of the Public
Service transformation policy.

Have there been achievements? I think there’s a need for us to state very
clearly and unequivocally that when we look at institution-building and
management we have come a long way. We’ve amalgamated and re-established
public services in the sense that from 14 disparate public services we’ve
built a single Public Service, and a transformed one at that.

So, significant progress has been made in advancing public sector reforms
in addition to the amalgamation that I’ve referred to in bringing it all
into one service. Since 1994 we’ve seen one of the world’s most far-
reaching programmes of public service reform and transformation in our own
country, resulting in services being extended to millions of our citizens -
from basic services to increased efficiency in revenue collection, and a
very positive environment for growth and economic development. We see this
in the trajectory that has been identified in the Reconstruction and
Development Programme, through the Growth, Employment and Redistribution
programme and now the Accelerated Shared Growth Initiative for South
Africa.

Do we have any intention and do we see the capacity to accelerate service
delivery? Yes, we do. Are there challenges? Indeed there are challenges,
because if you transform so large a machinery, it does not go without its
challenges, and there are challenges around capacity.

Hence, as government, we have a very clear focus on capacity assessments,
and these are being dealt with systematically. Under those assessments we
deal with skills assessment; we look at skills development and very
specific interventions in this regard; we look at capacity-building
programmes that target the officials at different levels of the Public
Service from the level of management all the way down, or starting from the
lowest level official going up.

We’re also looking at the challenges around integrated service delivery.
We’re dealing with improving and deepening planning as well as ensuring
that we have a sound, government-wide monitoring and evaluation system in
place. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Mr A J NYAMBI: Madam Speaker, I’d like to thank the hon Minister. The
question has been clearly answered, so I don’t have a follow-up. We’ll make
sure that we maximise the vigorous oversight in the various departments.
Thank you.

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker, the hon Minister spoke about the skills
deficit in the Public Service. Another challenge is also the growing
corruption in the Public Service. How can we ensure, with the principles of
ubuntu, that corruption is curbed in the Public Service? Thank you very
much.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Thank you, Madam
Speaker, and through you to the hon Roopnarain. I think we need to be
careful to simply look at corruption in the Public Service in isolation
from corruption that is pervasive in society as a whole. Also, we should
see our interventions in this regard in relation to a societal response.

I agree with the hon Roopnarain that we need to look at the kinds of values
that should and must underpin not just the Public Service but society as a
whole, and hence our endeavour to build a national integrity system.

In this regard it is not alien to us to embrace the value of ubuntu -
elsewhere in Africa we may call it ujamaa[familyhood] - which is very
clearly a central value that is captured in our Constitution, not
necessarily through the use of the term ubuntu, but in the need to ensure
that we pursue values that talk about the integrity of people, obviously in
such a manner that it does not allow for the abuse of power or authority by
any one person or the misuse of status or position for self-enrichment.
Finally, through ubuntu, no citizen should at any point feel compelled to
pay for a service that they have a right to, because public servants are
there to serve the community and ours is to ensure that we put in place the
kind of value system that is and furthers ubuntu, which comes from our past
as part of the traditional values of our country and our continent and that
must be reflected in our work ethic, in the integrity with which we take
things forward. I want to conclude by saying that this must not be limited
to the public sector, but be pervasive in all sectors of society.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order! Hon members, please lower
your voices.

Mnr K J MINNIE: Agb Voorsitter, agb Minister, “whether the Public Service
is in good stead” – dis ’n ope vraag of die Staatsdiens, met die oog op
versnelde dienslewering, in ’n goed genoeg toestand is. Kyk ’n mens na
diensleweringtyd, met ander woorde die tyd wat dit neem om diens te lewer,
met verwysing na departemente soos die Departement van Binnelandse Sake en
ons lisensie-afdelings in provinsies, dan ontstaan daar groot twyfel.

Die Minister bevraagteken syfers wat die DA ter tafel lê oor vakante poste
in die Staatsdiens, asook beramings wat uit die jaarverslae vir 2005-06
kom. Dit het nou tyd geword dat ons die feite oor vakatures oor die hele
spektrum van die Staatsdiens bekend maak, van skoonmaker tot
departementshoof.

Indien volledige syfers nie beskikbaar is nie, is my vraag aan die Minister
of sy bereid sal wees om ’ n oudit te laat doen om die feite oor vakatures
in die Staatsdiens te bekom. Indien nie, waarom nie? (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr K J MINNIE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, “whether the Public Service
is in good stead” – it is an open question, whether the Public Service, in
view of accelerated service delivery, is in good stead. When one looks at
service delivery time, in other words, the time that it takes to deliver a
service, with reference to departments such as the Department of Home
Affairs and our licence departments in provinces, then a big question
arises.

The Minister is questioning the figures that were tabled by the DA with
regard to vacant posts in the Public Service, as well as estimates obtained
from the annual reports for 2005-06. The time has now come that we make
known the facts with regard to vacancies across the full spectrum of the
Public Service, from cleaner to department head.

If the total figures are not available, then my question to the Minister is
whether she will be prepared to do an audit in order to obtain the facts
with regard to vacancies in the Public Service. If not, why not?]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Thank you very
much, Chairperson. Hon Minnie, are you trying to claim some easy victories
once again?

I think as government we’ve made it very clear that it is our business and
intention to establish exactly what the skills and competency levels are in
the Public Service. In terms of vacancy levels, we have those figures from
Persal. There’s no question about that. We are also looking at matching the
figures that are on Persal against what is in the personnel expenditure
budget.

In that regard as well, if you bothered to check the statement we issued
after the lekgotla, you would have been aware of the fact that we are
indeed looking very closely at ensuring ... No, not looking very closely –
we’ve actually instituted, since July of last year, a procedure in which
all Ministers, when looking at their organograms, make submissions to the
Minister for the Public Service and Administration so that we closely look
at the organogram against the strategic plans and business plans.

Part of this is to ensure that there is a signing off on organograms and a
placing of that information on our information systems as government, so
that there are alignments between the organograms in departments and the
budgets that are available. This is because right now the discrepancy
around figures relates, amongst other things, to the discrepancies as to
what’s on the organograms vis-à-vis what’s in the personnel expenditure and
Persal itself.

In terms of improving service delivery, there is no question that there are
differences, or shall I rather say, that we do have problems within the
Public Service and different levels of service delivery.

I want to give you one good example. The Government Employees Medical
Scheme, Gems, at this point in time has 100 000 plus principal members. If
you were a member of Gems, which, sadly, you cannot be at this point in
time, and you phoned a call centre, as a result of their having your
information, any one of the call centre operators would be able to respond
to you with all the details concerning your particular file, the
information you require, etc. Turnaround time there is excellent, and
that’s a reflection of very strong management at the head of that public
entity. [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order!

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: You don’t get that
with any other medical scheme at this point, and this is a government
employees׳ medical scheme. [Time expired.]
Mr H B CUPIDO: Chairperson, hon Minister, in order for the public visiting
government offices to be served by well-trained public officials, could the
Minister give this House the assurance that in order to be well understood
the public will be privileged to make their enquiries and complete
documentation in their mother tongue and that they will receive an answer
they will be able to understand, because surely communication in a mother
tongue must be an important factor in service delivery.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Hon Chair, this is
one thing that we aspire to. We cannot guarantee at this particular point
in time that any one of us in this House can speak all 11 official
languages. What we are aspiring to is to have public servants who are able
to speak more than one of the predominant regional languages in the areas
in which they are.

We have taken a decision, as part of our commitment to the roll-out of
Batho Pele something like three, four years ago, that we would encourage a
greater increase in proficiency in multilingualism in order to ensure that
we are able to serve the public in a multiplicity of languages, but we do
not guarantee something that we know is not possible, because, hon member,
other than two languages, I’m not sure which others you speak. Thank you
very much.

Mr M T LIKOTSI: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon Minister, with the exception of
managerial and administrative skills, are there programmes in place to help
to change the attitude of public servants towards the citizens, because we
perceive – or it is actually what is happening – public servants as not
having a sense of urgency. They are not caring, and this actually
destabilises the whole process of providing service to the citizens. I
thank you.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Thank you very
much, hon Chairperson. I’m sure, hon member, you are not suggesting that
it’s every public servant who has that attitude. I think we’re talking
about the rotten apples in the barrel who tend to spread and infect the
whole barrel.

But yes, indeed, we do have programmes that are specifically targeted at
changing the attitude and culture that have been prevalent in the Public
Service. I think you should remember that we come out of an old public
service that we had to start and started transforming 12 or 13 years ago.
If you look at the size of the Public Service – this colossus machinery -
it is not automatically going to transform overnight. Hence, right now we
are involved in what we call a massification programme by Samdi, the SA
Management Development Institute, that looks at the induction of 100 000
public servants a year.

The induction and reorientation is precisely to influence attitudes and
cultural approach, as well as specifically reorienting, steeping our public
servants in an understanding and appreciation of the Constitution, the
values in the Constitution and Chapter 10 of this Constitution that
reflects the very principles that should govern the Public Service, so
Samdi is leading that programme. That programme won’t be centrally led; it
will be decentralised and in many instances departments will run it, but we
are looking at a core curriculum to take this forward.

We also have a very specific programme called the Batho Pele Frontline
Service Delivery Programme, which also looks at the attitude, approach and
demeanour of public servants as they interface with the community and the
public. So, yes, we are working on that, but the big push right now is to
try to influence and impact quite greatly on the Public Service.

                   Proposed scrapping of VAT on medicines

53.   Mr G R Morgan (DA) asked the Minister of Health:

      (1)   Whether, in light of a recommendation by her department ’s
           Pricing Committee in 2006 that value-added tax (VAT) on
           medicines be scrapped, she has recommenced discussions with the
           Minister of Finance about this issue; if not, why not; if so,
           what are the relevant details;


      (2)   whether scrapping VAT on medicines on the essential drugs list
           will have an impact on the cost of medicines in the public
           sector; if not, what is the position in this regard; if so, what
           are the relevant details?               N352E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HEALTH: Sihlalo, impendulo yelungu elihloniphekile
imi kanje: [Chairperson, the response to the hon member’s question is as
follows:]

In her answer to this part of the question last year, the Minister of
Health indicated to the hon member that she had not recommended discussions
with the Minister of Finance on the removal of VAT on medicine.

She also indicated that the National Treasury had noted the VAT issue and
that the Minister of Finance had indicated that the correct policy was not
to zero-rate medicines. The issue of VAT on medicine prices has been
subjected to rigorous analysis by an international panel, and the Minister
of Finance is satisfied with the present status and hence no changes are
envisaged at this time.

With regard to the second part of the question, the Department of Health
does not believe that scrapping VAT would make medicines cheaper in the
public sector. VAT is only one of the factors affecting costs. Other
factors also come into play, such as the manufacturers׳ cost recovery
strategy, to ensure return on investment, as well as global market forces.

Only when these factors have been dealt with in our pricing structures
through, for example, the current international benchmarking exercise and
other similar measures, can we then understand the impact of VAT on the
cost of essential medicines.

Mr G R MORGAN: Thank you, hon Deputy Minister. I would hope that the
Department of Health would take on this issue and not defend the views of
the Treasury on this, no matter what their views are. This is because,
certainly, the government frequently trumps its regressive credentials, but
continues to implement many policies that are, in fact, progressive. VAT on
medicines is one of them, because it targets people who are sick. The
incumbent Minister, Dr Tshabalala-Msimang, said in January 2004 that she
would be introducing measures to reduce medicine prices by 50%, but the
target so far has exclusively been on the private sector, particularly
pharmacies.

Now, a study by the World Health Organisation shows that taxes on medicines
do provide minimal income to the government, but are nevertheless passed on
to sick people. Therefore, hon Deputy Minister, in principle do you agree
that it is necessary for the government to play its part in reducing the
cost of medicines by reducing VAT? Secondly, would you continue to
champion, from a Health department point of view and not a Treasury point
of view, the need to reduce VAT irrespective of the other components of
medicine pricing? [Time expired.]
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HEALTH: Thank you, hon member. Maybe I should start
by reminding this hon member that it is the ANC-led government that has
taken measures since 1994 to lower the cost of health care. Among the
measures that we have taken are to provide free primary health care for
pregnant mothers and children under six years of age. We are engaging with
the pharmaceutical industry and not just the pharmacists. The pharmacists
are but one part in the supply chain.

We are engaging with the industry in an attempt to lower the cost of
medicines, which, unfortunately as the member knows, is taking longer than
we had anticipated. But we are also working towards putting in place the
policy that will see a sharing of resources in the private health sector.

We are making good progress on the issue of the social health insurance,
which essentially aims to increase access to medical cover for the poor.
So, the price of medicines per se is one issue that we have been engaging
in from the start, to try to see that prices are reduced.

VAT alone is not the measure that will help us solve this problem. As I
have said, it depends on what the price is, from the manufacturer to the
pharmacist and to the supplier. In this regard, I also want to inform the
member that when we decide, as the public health sector, which supplier we
are going to give a tender to, it is based on the price that they offer us,
and at times we have been able to achieve as low as 40% of the price. So,
we have engaged in a number of exercises to try to mitigate the cost of
health care, including the price of medicines.

I also want to remind the hon member that he must realise that the Minister
of Finance cannot just exempt the state from paying VAT on medicines,
because the system will be very difficult to administer. Manufacturers and
distributors that sell to the state would have to declare how much medicine
the state has bought and, therefore, how much VAT exclusion they would
have, as opposed to the same medicines they would have sold to the private
sector.

So, as you can see, this is a very cumbersome process that our Revenue
Service would have to administer. In fact, I would think that we are trying
to introduce something that would be very difficult to implement. But
indeed this government, led by the ANC, is very committed to lowering the
cost of health care. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr A F MADELLA: Chairperson and hon members, please allow me to express our
collective appreciation for the eloquent, illuminating reply by our Deputy
Minister of Health to the hon G R Morgan.

Hon Deputy Minster, an ongoing challenge of your Ministry is to see to the
procurement, as you rightly pointed out, of medicine from the
pharmaceutical industry at an affordable price rate for the public sector,
in particular the public health sector which services the poorest of the
poor.

Hon Deputy Minister, is there perhaps a sense from you that the
pharmaceutical industry is using the issue of the scrapping of VAT from
medicine as a smokescreen to hide their reluctance to make medicine
available to the public health sector and, ultimately, the poorest of the
poor at an affordable price? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HEALTH: Thank you, hon member, and thank you very
much for your congratulations on the answer. This is the ANC policy that I
am articulating. I think, indeed, you should thank the ANC for putting in
place these kinds of policies.

Indeed, as the ANC, we are concerned about the plight of the poor; we are
concerned about the prices of medicines in this country. People have told
us that if you go to the UK, you can find exactly the same medicines that
we buy here but at a much lower price. So I think all of us, including the
opposition, should be working hard to ensure that indeed the manufacturers
and the suppliers all work with us.

This is because there is something you can never buy. You can never buy
health. When you are sick, what you want is to improve; you want to get
better, and if you cannot access health care simply because you cannot
afford the cost of health care, all of us must realise that this is a
violation of one of the most fundamental of our rights.

In this case, hon member, I would really like to engage, as we have started
to do, with the private sector, to say “Yes, it is right for you to make
profits, but please think about what happens to poor people when they
cannot afford basic health care.”

Section 27 of Chapter 2 of our Constitution says that health is a basic
human right. We need everybody to assist us in this. We know that some
pharmaceutical industries are actually not keen to sell to the state some
of their medicines because they say the state cannot afford the prices. Now
that they actually realise this, we think they should ask themselves, “Is
it fair to charge so much that even the state cannot afford to pay?”
[Applause.]

Mr G R MORGAN: Madam Deputy Minister, it is your own pricing committee that
recommended the scrapping of VAT on medicines in 2006, it wasn’t the
pharmaceutical companies. Perhaps, as I have said before, it is not
necessary for you to defend the Treasury, but to defend those people who
are sick in South Africa and need VAT.

What I am asking for is an equitable division. The private sector must do
what they can, but so must the public sector. So, I put the question to you
again, Madam Deputy Minister: Would you at least seek to engage the
Minister of Finance on this issue, because you have said you have not
sought discussions with him yet?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HEALTH: The reply that I gave you, hon member, is a
reply from the Minister of Finance. So the very fact that we have been able
to get the reply from him does indicate that we have taken the step to ask
him what the situation is, what the implications would be if VAT were to be
scrapped. He has given us an answer, and we are satisfied with that answer.
He has told us that it would be extremely complicated to say that only
those suppliers that sell to the state would then, from our side, not pay
VAT, while in the private sector VAT would continue to be paid.

I want to mention to you, hon member, that when the Minister appoints a
committee, that committee is meant to look at all the various angles of
that issue. The committee then reports to the Minister. It is the
responsibility of the Minister, as the person who has been appointed by the
President, to have applied her mind. Indeed, she did in this case, even go
to the point of speaking to Treasury, and this is the answer that Treasury
gave us. We are satisfied with the answer. We are working very hard to
lower the prices of medicines, but the scrapping of VAT, at this stage, is
not an option.

    Steps to ensure reasonable and non-discriminatory fees at educational
                                institutions
38.   Ms M J J Matsomela (ANC) asked the Minister of Education:


      What steps have been taken to ensure that fee increases (a) at higher
      education institutions are not excessive and (b) do not discriminate
      against poor students?                                   N337E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you, Chairperson. The reply to the
question is as follows. With respect to part (a) of the question: there is
currently no government policy that regulates student fees at higher
education institutions. The determination of a fee structure is the
responsibility of the councils of higher education institutions.

I have, however, on a number of occasions, raised my concerns about the
rates of fee increment and the escalations that we see in this sector. In
this regard, I directed my department to work jointly with the National
Treasury to investigate the macro funding for higher education. This report
highlighted, amongst other things, the need for further investment in
higher education to minimise the impact of fees for access to higher
education.

In addition, I have requested the vice chancellors of higher education
institutions, through their body Hesa, Higher Education SA, to investigate
the primary drivers that lead to the current high fee increases. I will
continue to work with the National Treasury and higher education
institutions to develop a sustainable solution to the problem.

With respect to part (b) of the question, which relates to the impact on
poor students, our government is committed to assisting financially needy
but academically deserving students through the National Student Financial
Aid Scheme, NSFAS. In this regard, the current government contribution,
including loan repayments to the scheme, is over R1,3 billion. In addition,
students who are allocated financial aid through NSFAS are not required to
pay upfront registration fees, which have been a hardship factor for many
students, as I have provided for this in the bursaries that are provided to
them.

Ms M J J MATSOMELA: Thank you, Chairperson. Minister, thank you very much
for your response. As the department and the National Treasury engage with
different institutions, I think we should be cognisant of the
interpretation of this practice of escalating fees by the public. The
perception that has been created out there is that this is but another form
of discrimination against the poor students by denying them access to these
institutions.

With regard to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, I would like to
know how many students have already benefited from this scheme and in which
areas of study they enrolled. I thank you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I have to write down the questions first so that
I can answer them, Chairperson. I have addressed the matter of how we deal
with the impact of fee increases for students and, as I have indicated,
we’ll continue to work with institutions. We have already begun to see a
fairly significant appreciation of the budget allocated for higher
education, and I think this is a positive signal from government of support
to higher education. I hope that there will be a quid pro quo, through the
councils of our institutions, which will see a decline in the levels of fee
increments that we see in this sector.

The number of students that has been assisted through the National Student
Financial Aid Scheme since its introduction - and I begin with the Tertiary
Education Fund of SA, which was established around 1992 and began providing
support to students as the whole number forms part of the pool that relates
to the NSFAS – is over 160 000.

Of course, the assistance takes a range of forms. The poorer students
receive a higher allocation, while those who have some financial means
might get an award, at times a single award or repeated over their degree
study period, but small amounts because their families have some financial
means. The poorest students are the beneficiaries of the National Student
Financial Aid Scheme and the fields are all the disciplines that are
offered in higher education.

Mr M J ELLIS: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I want to say that the way
the question was put to the Minister seems to suggest that the questioner
believes that universities can run on fresh air. Obviously, this is not the
case, and I think that the Minister has indicated this to some extent.

But, I am also saying, Madam Minister, that I don’t believe your answer has
been entirely clear, and I look for clarity from you this afternoon. I
think it really is time that the ANC did make up its mind that either
tertiary education is free to all, or that students must pay fees, while
deserving cases must be given scholarships and certainly on merit. Really,
Madam Minister, I would like you to please clarify your point with regards
to this if you would. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, this is the first time I have been
accused of not being clear, so I’m a bit taken aback. [Laughter.] But it is
only the hon Ellis who can say that to me and get away with it.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): He wants to benefit from your
teaching skills, Madam Minister.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I don’t know. Well, I am not aware of any
university that runs on fresh air. There are some institutions in the
country, particularly private higher education institutions, that enjoy
full subsidies from certain private-sector companies in the country. But,
clearly, I have indicated that it should be possible for higher education
institutions to manage their costs better. If one examines some of what
goes on in some of our universities, there is certainly a sense that some
of the increments might not be entirely justified.

This is why, instead of imposing a framework that would limit increments or
fee levels, we have asked Hesa to actually examine the matter. This is
because if you do a comparative analysis internationally, the fee levels -
the income from tuition fees - in most university systems throughout the
world range from 20% to 22% of the entire budget of the university. In
South Africa the ranges are far higher than 25%.

So, clearly, we are falling outside of the international law and we need to
address why. This is because there doesn’t seem to be a good rationale as
to why we would extend well beyond internationally accepted norms. These
are the questions I have put to Hesa.

Part of the rationale that they may have cited a year or two ago, was, of
course, the fact that the subsidy they were receiving from government have
had years of decline, but we have now actually had a significant
improvement. Several vice chancellors have, in fact, expressed support and
appreciation for the kinds of changes they are beginning to see in subsidy
levels and support for infrastructure and development in the universities.
Mr Leon, do resist asking; I know what you would want to ask about.

With respect to the policy of the ANC, we do not have a policy that there
is free higher education. Our policy is very clear that universities are
allowed to charge tuition fees. Students that are academically able have
the potential to succeed, but that do not have the financial means are
supported through the financial aid scheme and a range of bursaries and
scholarships from the private sectors, state-owned enterprises, private
individuals and in a range of other ways.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon Minister, you have answered my
questions but I still want to ask you the following. Hon Minister, how will
the increase in the fees of higher education institutions be determined for
each student between the rich and the poor? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, I am not quite sure how to answer
that. But I think one has to point out that in many societies there has
been recognition that if you want a sustainable and thriving higher
education sector, you can’t rely solely on public means. Hence, the
recognition that due to the immense private benefit that derives to a
person who has completed a higher education programme, it is, in fact,
fairly logical and reasonable to demand some fee from those who can pay and
then for the state to support those who do not have the means to pay. So,
we are well within international practice in the manner that we are
providing higher education fee support to young people in South Africa.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): The last question goes to the IFP,
to Mr A M Mpontshane.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Thank you, Chair. Hon Minister, there is another
category of students, which is those students who are admitted but halfway
through they fail to pay the university. The university lets them continue
until their final year of study. What happens is that the university
withholds the results and these students end up not knowing whether they
have passed their final year or not. Is there any way that the department
can intervene to help such students who find themselves in this situation?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, there have been instances in which
I have been approached by students who have been in such a situation. Where
a young person has had a successful job interview and has a job offer, but
requires proof of completion of a degree in order to actually take up the
offer of a post, the university usually, in collaboration with an employer,
will provide certified results and an arrangement to repay the university
would be made.

There are contractual obligations that the new graduate might have towards
the institution. So, I think, the students who have made contractual
obligations need to meet those obligations. But where a student really
doesn’t have financial means - just cannot, in any way, meet the obligation
- we would ask the university to see how they can assist them. Of course,
when many of us were at university we sought part-time jobs to assist here
and there to pay for the little things. We didn’t have hi-fi sets in the
dormitories we occupied, nor did we have radios, nor was there beer-
drinking, nor did we have cellphones, nor were we able to pay cellphone
costs.

There are some cost measures that we must also look at, so that while we
receive support we also recognise that achieving our degree is an important
discipline and responsibility that we also need to play a part in.

             Analysis of policy implementation in Public Service

41.   Mr B Mthembu (ANC) asked the Minister for the Public Service and
      Administration:

      (1)   Whether she or her department has done any impact analysis into
           the implementation of policies in the Public Service since the
           dawn of freedom in South Africa; if so, what are the output
           and/or outcomes in this regard; if not, why not;


      (2)   whether such a policy analysis is critically important; if not;
           why not; if so, what are the relevant details;


      (3)   whether there is any specific emphasis on accelerating outcomes-
           based policy implementation measures as we advance into the
           second decade of freedom; if not, why not; if so, what are the
           relevant details?                       N340E


The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Thanks,
Chairperson, and thanks to the House. I think it is clear that in order for
government to be effective in the delivery of services to the people, it is
critical that state administrations put in place systems to monitor and
evaluate the implementation of policies. This is a challenging task and is
quite central to the international debate on public service reform.

Such systems are new areas, and governments across the world are striving
to develop effective systems and measures to monitor and evaluate the
performance of government developments, and the effectiveness of government
programmes.

Let me give you some specific examples of what we are doing. I think,
firstly, we should say that there is the government-wide monitoring and
evaluation system, which is a very key programme for the governance and
administration cluster. In this regard, the President, in his state of the
nation address of February 2007 this year and in the government programme
of action, clearly indicated the acknowledgement within the Public Service
of the critical importance of monitoring and evaluation. So, we acknowledge
the need to create a culture of continual learning and evidence-based
decision-making to facilitate continual improvement.

As a government, we have led the development of this government-wide impact
evaluation programme, and it is a unique and innovative government-led
approach for improving evidence-based policy-making through the use of
rigorous impact-evaluation techniques.

This particular programme was initiated at a seminar held in Pretoria in
June last year. We are moving forward with it through the implementation of
seven large-scale and methodologically rigorous evaluations of programmes
in the Departments of Agriculture, Land Affairs, Housing, Provincial and
Local Government, Education, Social Development, Trade and Industry and
Health.

The high degree to which the programme is being institutionalised and
embedded across several major departments, and the significant progress
made by sector departments since June last year demonstrates a high level
of commitment to internalising the values of impact evaluation for
advancing government’s programmes.

The programme is of strategic importance, because it will set us as a model
for countries in the region and across the world. Thanks, Chairperson.
[Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Hon members, I appeal to you to
lower your voices, please.

Mr B MTHEMBU: Hon Chair and hon Minister, let me express my thanks for your
very incisive response. Arising from your response, an indication has been
made that policy monitoring and evaluation is not only intended to assess
implementation challenges, but is equally important in identifying areas in
which amendments may be made.

Now, that being the case, would you indicate to us whether there are any
policy areas that would need some kind of a review so as to enhance their
potential for the realisation of the intended outcomes? Thank you.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINSTRATION: Thank you very much,
hon Chairperson ... Deputy Chair. Is it Chairperson or the Deputy Chair?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Chairperson.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chairperson. Thanks
for the correction. We have ongoing peer reviews, as you can see.
[Laughter.]

So, in response to the question, indeed we see it as an important tool. It
is a bit early, in view of the studies we are conducting, to indicate where
the reviews will take place, but what we will definitely do is to use them
to deepen areas of service delivery.

If the Minister of Education permits me, an example I could make reference
to is that the Department of Education has agreed to identify the inventory
of Quintile 1 schools by province, in terms of which they will define the
quality of roll-out capacity within each province. In terms of this the
source of data for the impact evaluation will include achievement tests on
numeracy and literacy and data on school infrastructure, which will be
drawn from the national education infrastructure management system.

Having said that, the outcomes of those findings and the whole impact
evaluation that will be done will surely inform the Minister of Education
what considerations we should take forward, as the government, in deepening
our work on advancing numeracy and literacy in schools. Thanks.

Mnr K J MINNIE: Agb Voorsitter en agb Minister, ons kom pas verlede week
uit ‘n baie geslaagde anti-korrupsie konferensie, “The Africa Forum on
Fighting Corruption.”  Ubuntu, integriteit en implementering, ensovoorts is
baie erg en sterk gedebatteer.

Beleidsimplementering is van uiterste belang en daarom is dit baie
kommerwekkend dat die staatsdienskommissie, in sy mediumtermyn strategiese
plan, die volgende syfers ten opsigte van korrupsie binne die Staatsdiens
sedert 2004 bekend gemaak het. Die getal sake wat sedert 2004 na die
department verwys is, is 3 650. Dit sluit in dienslewering en sake wat nie
met korrupsie gekoppel kan word nie, met ander woorde, navrae wat ontvang
is, wat 1 120 beloop.

Daar is steeds 2 217 onafgehandelde korrupsie sake. Minister, my vraag is:
Watter maatreëls word getref om hierdie onaanvaarbare laksheid van
departemente te stop om teen korrupte amptenare op te tree? Dankie. [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr K J Minnie: Hon Chairperson and hon Minister, last  week  we  have  just
returned from a  very  successful  anticorruption  conference,  “The  Africa
Forum on Fighting Corruption”. Ubuntu,  integrity  and  implementation,  etc
were debated very seriously and vigorously.

Policy implementation is of extreme  importance,  and  it  is  therefore  of
great concern  that  the  Public  Service  Commission,  in  its  medium-term
strategic plan, made the following figures known with regard  to  corruption
within the Public Service since 2004. The number of  cases  that  have  been
referred to this department  since  2004  is  3  650.  It  includes  service
delivery and cases  that  are  unrelated  to  corruption,  in  other  words,
enquiries that have been received amount to 1 120.

There are still 2 217 corruption cases in  progress.  Minister  my  question
is: Which  measures  are  taken  to  end  this  unacceptable  negligence  of
departments to act against corrupt officials? Thank you. [Time expired.]]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Thank you very
much.

Ek is baie dankbaar dat die agb lid baie nou geluister het in daardie
konferensie en selfs geluister het na ... [I am very grateful that the hon
member has listened attentively in that conference and has even listened to
...]

... what the Public Service Commission put before the portfolio committee.

Indeed, we have performed various assessments on degrees of corruption, or
the extent of corruption, within the Public Service. We have also done it
in broader society as a whole. We have done an audit of compliance by
departments with regard to the overall framework that we have put in place
in terms of the Public Service anticorruption strategy.

In terms of this, hon member, we have noted the point  you  have  raised  as
actually being the cases that have  been  reported  to  the  Public  Service
Commission both in terms of the help line and in terms  of  whistle-blowing.
Our task is to follow up on this. We would like to increase  the  levels  of
compliance that we are currently seeing. It is necessary  to  state,  if  we
look at the audit that has been done to date, that 65% of  departments  have
complied with the set requirements.

We would like to move towards a situation in  which  we  see  100%  or  much
closer to 100% compliance. Our task  is  to  ensure  that  both  the  Public
Service Commission and governance and administration look  very  closely  at
the extent  to  which  we  can  ensure  full  compliance  with  the  various
regulatory and compliance frameworks that we  have  put  in  place.  Thanks.
[Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Thank you, Chair. Hon Minister, I am partly covered. In
the state of the nation address, President Mbeki said, and I quote:

  We need to be prepared to roll up our sleeves and get down to work, fully
  understanding that the task to build South Africa for which we yearn is a
  common responsibility we all share.
Now, how do we ensure that this becomes the lifeblood of managers and every
civil servant; that they begin to realise their responsibility towards the
citizens and the community so that service is not just unhampered but
begins to flow? Thank you.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: There is a fair
amount we can do in terms of the various regulatory and compliance
frameworks; and I have spoken about part of that. We have spoken about
ongoing monitoring of government services, the use of the government-wide
monitoring and evaluation system.

We need to look at the more effective use of performance management
systems. There is the importance of the role of the executive in effecting
performance management systems within departments, and ensuring the
performance evaluation of directors-general, and that being implemented
within government departments.

There is also the big question of the role of Parliament and its oversight,
and ensuring that the executive and administration are held accountable by
Parliament.

Finally, I think we should remember that a lot of this is also based on our
own individual and community-collective understanding of our commitment to
public service in ensuring that we do comply with the values that are set
out in our Constitution and ensure the fulfilment of those values. So,
there is a role for all of us in taking this forward. I thank you.

   Expenditure of capital budgets by municipalities falling under Project
                                 Consolidate

68.   Mr M M Swathe (DA) asked the Minister for Provincial and Local
      Government:

      (1)   Whether, in light of the fact that 20 municipalities falling
           under Project Consolidate spent less than 10% of their capital
           budgets for the first quarter of the 2006-07 financial year, his
           department has taken any steps to ensure that municipalities
           falling under Project Consolidate will spend their full capital
           budgets by the end of the 2006-07 financial year; if not, (a)
           why not and (b) who is held accountable for this under-spending;
           if so, what steps;


      (2)   whether any action has been taken against those accountable; if
           not, why not; if so, what action?       N368E

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, the
answer to the question by the hon member is that he should note, firstly,
that the National Treasury monitors municipal budgets, for example capital
and operational in terms of sections 71 and 72 of the Local Government:
Municipal Finance Management Act. On the other hand, the Department of
Provincial and Local Government monitors the municipal infrastructure grant
allocation.

With regard to the part of the question on the municipal infrastructure
grant allocation, the answer is: R2,2 billion was allocated to all the 139
Project Consolidate municipalities for the financial year 2006-07. Project
Consolidate municipalities reported expenditure of R1,1 billion or 49% as
at the end of the second quarter of the municipal financial year.

As the Department of Provincial and Local Government, we are satisfied with
the current spending levels and we are confident that these municipalities
will be able to spend their allocations.

In view of the fact that the hon member has not identified the specific
municipalities he is concerned about, no comment can be made thereon.
However, municipalities are generally provided with support to ensure that
they utilise all the funds granted to them for the intended purposes.

The answer to part (b) of the question is that accounting officers for
municipalities are responsible for expenditure management in terms of
section 65 of the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Act.
However, there is no evidence currently of gross underspending.
The answer to part (2) regarding grants to municipalities is that the
annual Division of Revenue Act, Dora, makes provision for the management of
all transfers, receiving officers – for example, government departments,
provinces and municipalities. It also makes provision for the handling of
noncompliance and nonperformance relating to the transfer made by receiving
officers. Such action may include the withholding, stopping and
reallocation of transfers. The relevant provisions of Dora, with regard to
underspending on the municipal infrastructure grant, will be applied should
evidence of such underspending come to the fore. Thank you.

Mr M M SWATHE: Thank you very much, Chairperson and Deputy Minister. Deputy
Minister, two weeks ago we experienced and witnessed protests by the people
of the North West province about the lack of service delivery by
municipalities, and yet a bulk of money from the last financial year was
unspent. It is also noted in the Auditor-General’s report that the majority
of municipalities, including those under Project Consolidate, got qualified
reports. This indicates that Project Consolidate is failing to deliver on
its mandate. If this is so, what action will the Deputy Minister and her
department take to correct the situation; if not, why not? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, all
of what you call "unrest" in the various municipalities have political
connotations. As I said earlier, regarding the 139 municipalities
identified under Project Consolidate, we have specialists that are actually
busy in those municipalities assisting with the lack of capacity in those
municipalities. I don’t think I should actually repeat that.

But what I would like to share with the hon member is that at the extended
Cabinet lekgotla in January 2007, it was decided that the White Paper on
Local Government of 1998 would be reviewed. This process will further
examine the question of the institutional and funding capacities of our
municipalities. It will also reflect on the lessons of Project Consolidate
and priorities of the five-year local government strategic agenda.

It should be remembered that our framework for local government finances is
based on grants from national government - conditional and unconditional
grants - and sources of own revenue. Thank you.

Ms P BHENGU: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon Minister, do you believe that the
Project Consolidate municipalities are indeed beginning to generate the
critical skills required to correct the incapacities currently experienced?


The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, when
the department decided upon Project Consolidate together with Cabinet, it
was a pilot project so that we could ascertain what was happening in local
municipalities. I think it is too soon for people to say that Project
Consolidate is not working.

As I said, we will wait until the end of their term of Project Consolidate
so that we can make a proper assessment. At the moment what we as the
department are saying, is that we think Project Consolidate has made some
impact on the various municipalities. It is also very early to say how big
the impact is, but we believe that something needs to be done. We can’t
just simply sit back and say the municipalities have no capacity at all. We
need to come with a programme, and that pilot programme is Project
Consolidate.

Mr P F SMITH: Chair, I thought I heard the Deputy Minister saying now, in
response to the question from hon Swathe, that she or the government, at
least, was satisfied with the level of spending on capital grants.

Minister, I have a newspaper report here - and perhaps one doesn’t give too
much credence to newspaper reports - that quotes a senior official, Mr
Bologo, in your department, who says that there is persistent underspending
on the MIG grant and that this is so bad that the department was requesting
Treasury to reallocate funds. In fact, you made reference to the Dora
proposals yourself. The report also goes on to say that 106 municipalities
have already been identified for this reallocation of funds; further, that
if you identify the provinces where this is problematic, they are the
Eastern Cape with R144 million, Gauteng with R117 million and Mpumalanga
with an R80 million shortfall on their spending. Given that, Deputy
Minister, would it be satisfactory for you to indicate that you are happy
with the spending levels as they are at present?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, I did
not say that I am happy, but I said we are quite satisfied with the trend
in spending so far.

Unfortunately, you are quoting from a newspaper report that I haven’t seen;
so it is very difficult for me to comment on some newspaper report that is
not in front of me. What we are saying as a department is that we are
fairly satisfied because things are beginning to move, and, with those
assistants and the capacity that we were talking about, we are fairly
satisfied. We hope that the municipalities will spend all the MIG money.

What we also want to say, as the department, is that from now on if
particular municipalities are unable to spend all those MIG funds, we will
take them to the performing municipalities. That is the best way to ensure
that municipalities do perform and finalise their funds. Thank you.

Mr W P DOMAN: Chair, it’s exactly on this last point that I want to
question the hon Deputy Minister. By reallocating money away from poor-
spending municipalities to those that are performing, isn’t that going to
lead to more skewed development in our country? Shouldn’t we rather
concentrate on capacitating those municipalities that can’t deliver,
especially in the rural areas, because this is a new apartheid development
that you are creating now?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, I am
earning my salary today. [Laughter.] I hear your concern, hon member, and I
think it is correct. I think that these programmes can run simultaneously;
it doesn’t mean that simply because we remove funds from a nonperforming
municipality to one that is performing that we can’t run these programmes
parallel to each other, because it is also our responsibility to capacitate
those local municipalities so that we can improve service delivery. This is
because, at the end of the day, ordinary people must be able to feel the
service delivery of a particular municipality.

I think those programmes that we will run simultaneously will assist with
capacity. At the same time, we need to also create healthy competition
amongst municipalities. That is why, at times, hon member, you see this
unrest – I don’t like this word “unrest” – or these disturbances in the
various local municipalities. This is because one performing municipality
will perhaps deliver so many houses, whereas the municipality next to that
particular municipality will not deliver houses. That is where the problem
is – with performing and nonperforming municipalities. People ask why a
particular municipality is able to build so many houses while they still
live with the bucket system. Thank you.

       Use of dam water for economic development of Bushbuckridge area

71.   Mr M W Sibuyana (IFP) asked the Minister of Water Affairs and
      Forestry:

      (1)   Whether the supply of water from the Inyaka Dam to Bushbuckridge
           is intended to satisfy both the domestic and economic water
           needs of the local communities; if not, how does her department
           plan to address issues of the use of water for economic
           development in this area;


      (2)   whether her department will consider the utilisation of water
           from the Klaserie Dam for the economic development of the
           Bushbuckridge area; if not, why not; if so, what are the
           relevant details?
           N372E

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Hon Chairperson, my
department’s integrated approach to water management has to take into
account various considerations and competing demands for water, and it
tries to address these competing demands by taking into account, firstly,
social equity, where we look at the equitable distribution of water amongst
all people and at ensuring that as we do that we do address and redress the
imbalances of the past.
Secondly, we look at ecological sustainability, so that our aquatic
ecosystems are protected, and so that we preserve the quality of our water
resources, and so that we balance the water use as required both by
upstream and downstream users.

Thirdly, we have financial considerations, which enable us to continue to
generate revenue from the supply of this water that assists us with the
management, upkeep and maintenance of infrastructure whilst, at the same
time, ensuring that the poor are addressed through receiving free basic
water and other poverty eradication programmes.

Lastly, we also take into account economic considerations and economic
efficiency so that there’s greater efficiency in the allocation of water,
particularly in those areas where water is very scarce.

To ensure that all these considerations and all these demands are properly
balanced and measured, we as the department have decided that we are going
to establish, at a very local level, what we call catchment management
agencies for every water management area in South Africa where local people
are represented - the municipality, business and everyone who has anything
to do with that water. These demands are going to be weighed properly by
the catchment management agencies.

It is in this context therefore that the supply of water from the Inyaka
Dam to Bushbuckridge must be considered. We have to address all these
needs. Currently, the Inyaka Dam has 123 million cubic metres and was
constructed specifically to address the growing needs in Bushbuckridge.

Regarding to the second part of the question, we do not intend to supply
Bushbuckridge from the Klaserie Dam as the intention is to increase the
capacity to supply Bushbuckridge from this Inyaka Dam. The Klaserie Dam, as
you know, coming from this area, is a very small dam in comparison to the
Inyaka Dam. In comparison, its yield is only 12% of that of the Inyaka Dam,
and, as we speak, the water from the Klaserie Dam is fully utilised. Thank
you.

Mr M W SIBUYANA: Thank you, Chairperson and hon Minister. As far as I know,
and I was there this past weekend, the water supplied to Bushbuckridge from
the Inyaka Dam is only for domestic use. That water has nothing to do with
economic development. What does the department intend doing about the
economic development of the people in the area?

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Chairperson, the hon member is
correct in that currently the water from the Inyaka Dam, which is pumped up
to the Inyaka Dam reservoir, where it is purified and then transferred to
Bushbuckridge, is currently being used for domestic use because it is
potable water.
We do acknowledge, as a department, that there is the requirement of water
to be used for economic reasons as well. It is important to say that in
this area there is a significant amount of irrigation that is taking place
in Bushbuckridge, mainly by black farmers. This is economic development
because here we are talking agriculture.

My department is currently working with the provincial government as well
as the local government to see how we can increase the supply of water from
the Inyaka Dam to Bushbuckridge to enable us to supply not only domestic
water, but also to support emerging economic development, which could be
tourism. This is if you look at the utilisation of the dam itself around
clubs, fishing, golf courses of course, and all of that, and it could also
be used for agriculture and other economic activities. So, we are working.

I think the hon member must remember that potable water must be used for
drinking. We are trying to get water for economic development, which is
going to be used for economic development. Thank you.

Mev D VAN DER WALT: Dankie, Voorsitter. Ek wil graag twee dinge van die
Minister weet met betrekking tot Bosbokrand. Die eerste vraag is: Met
verwysing na die nuwe dam wat gebou gaan word, die De Hoop-dam, is enige
navorsing gedoen om ook vir die gemeenskappe van Bosbokrand ’n pypleiding
aan te lê en ook daar te help met die voorsiening? Dit is ’n baie groot
area, natuurlik, baie wydverspreid, en daar is baie probleme met water. Die
tweede vraag is of daar enige voorsiening is of beplanning gedoen word vir
die droogte-omstandighede, spesifiek in Bosbokrand? Dankie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mrs D VAN DER WALT: Thank you,  Chairperson.  I  would  like  to  know  two
things from the Minister with regard to Bosbokrand. The first  question  is:
With regard to the new dam that will be built, the De Hoop Dam, whether  any
research has been  done  about  laying  pipelines  for  the  communities  of
Bosbokrand and helping with the supply there as  well?  Naturally  it  is  a
very big area, and widespread, and there are many problems with  water.  The
second question is whether  any  provision  or  planning  is  made  for  the
drought conditions, specifically in Bosbokrand? Thank you.]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Chairperson, the question about
Bosbokrand, water supply pipelines and drought is a new question. I would
appreciate it if the hon member would table that question for proper
attention. Thank you.

Mev D VAN DER WALT: Voorsitter, ek neem die Minister se punt in ag dat ek
oor die droogte-omstandighede ’n aparte vraag moet stel. Maar is daar
ondersoek gedoen of die De Hoop-dam kan bydra? Daar is hier gevra oor
Inyakadam en Klaseriedam. Is De Hoop-dam ook in ag geneem vir dieselfde
gemeenskappe? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mrs D  VAN  DER  WALT:  Chairperson,  I  take  the  Minister’s  point  into
consideration that I should  ask  a  separate  question  about  the  drought
conditions. But has it  been  investigated  whether  the  De  Hoop  Dam  can
contribute? There was a question asked here about the  Inyaka  Dam  and  the
Klaserie Dam. Was the De Hoop Dam also  taken  into  consideration  for  the
same communities?]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Minister, I don’t know  the  geography
of that area. I don’t know whether the question is related.
The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Chairperson, as I’ve said, the
question is completely unrelated. The hon member knows that various studies
have been done, and I’ve answered questions about De Hoop Dam here. She
must table a question about this particular area she is referring to - I’m
not sure whether it’s Bushbuckridge – so that I can respond to it as far as
the De Hoop Dam is concerned.

What I’ve said is that what we are doing in Bushbuckridge right now is
concentrating on the Inyaka Dam in order to get the complete supply of
water required. Maybe in the future, if it proves feasible, we could look
at the Klaserie Dam to see if we can get water from there, or if we can get
water from outside the area of Bushbuckridge. Thank you.

         School Nutrition Programme: status and plans for extension

39.   Mr B G Mosala (ANC) asked the Minister of Education:

      (1)   What is the status of the School Nutrition Programme;


      (2)   whether there are any plans to extend this scheme to secondary
           school learners; if not, why not; if so, what plans?
                                                                    N338E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, the reply to the question is as
follows. With respect to the first part of the question, the national
School Nutrition Scheme is proceeding well in most of the provinces. The
Eastern Cape has faced a number of challenges, but these have been
addressed and children are once again being provided with school meals.

With respect to the second part of the question, the Northern Cape and the
Western Cape have extended the programme to some secondary schools. The
Western Cape provides school meals to 21 000 learners in 116 Quintile 1 and
2 secondary schools, while the Northern Cape provides school meals to 59
862 learners in 101 Quintile 1 and 2 secondary schools.

In collaboration with the Financial and Fiscal Commission, my department
has undertaken research into the feasibility of extending the nutrition
programme to all deserving secondary schools in our provinces. The report
from this study is currently being finalised and we will make a statement
on the findings when we have the report. Thank you.

Mr B G MOSALA: Thank you, Chairperson. Thank you, Minister, for the
response that you have given. Furthermore, I wish to commend our ANC-led
government for demonstrating so much concern and care for the basic rights
of children. We extend an appeal to officials at all levels of government,
school management teams as well as voluntary food handlers and suppliers
entrusted with the task of rolling out this programme to do so with honesty
and integrity.

However, my question is whether we have sufficient and effective measures
in place to deal with defaulters who undermine specific conditions laid
down for the successful implementation of this important programme. Thank
you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon Minister, we have two minutes for
supplementary questions and answers, so try to make this brief, please.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Yes, I will be brief, Chairperson. I just want
to say yes, we do have measures in place. I have a co-ordinating unit in
the national department. We have now appointed co-ordinators in every
province. Every provincial department has a team and, therefore, whenever
there is a difficulty we actually work with the directors that serve as the
provincial co-ordinating teams in order to assist the provinces to address
their problems.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Thank you. Hon Boinamo, will you also
help by keeping it short?

Mr G G BOINAMO: Modulasetulo, ke tla leka go tsibosa Ntlo e gore kgang e ke
tla simololang ka yona ga se mafoko ame ke nopolo e e tswang mo go
Noseweek: “Let them eat kak”. [Chairperson, I would like to warn this House
that what I am going say at the beginning of my speech to start with are
not my words, it is a quotation from Noseweek:”Let them eat kak”.]

   A bunch of well-connected ANC fat cats are using an Eastern Cape school

[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon member, please take your seat.
There is a point of order.

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Chairperson, I rise on a point of order: the
reference to a particular article, which is not parliamentary material, and
the reference to the words specifically are unparliamentary.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): I got the words. Thank you.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Chair, can I address you on that please?
[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): You may address me, yes.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Chair, the hon member was quoting from a newspaper
article, and I believe under the circumstances it is quite in order for
that word to be used. [Interjections.] He is not using it in an unusual
context; he is quoting it from the newspaper.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon Deputy Chief Whip, the hon
Frolick is quite right. The wording is unparliamentary whether it comes
from a newspaper or not, and the fact that it is quoted from a newspaper is
not acceptable. [Applause.] Hon Boinamo, I would ask you to withdraw that
particular statement.

Mr G G BOINAMO: I withdraw.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Thank you. On this point, hon
Boinamo, having had very little time to ask the question, I am going to say
that your time has expired. Thank you. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Chair, on a totally unrelated matter, could I please
indicate to you that the hon Ministers of Finance, Public Service, and
Justice and Constitutional Development appear to be restudying a document
which is of great interest to this whole House. I wonder whether the
Minister of Finance or any of the Ministers would care to give us a bit of
information as to what is in that document they are studying.
[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Go ahead, hon Minister. We are very
interested.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: It is a race card for Kenilworth racecourse
tomorrow. I don’t know of what interest it is to the House. [Laughter.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Well, perhaps you can pass on the
information to us if you have a winner. The time allocated for questions of
all kinds has expired and outstanding replies received will be printed in
Hansard.

             CONDOLENCES TO PARENTS OF SHELDEAN HUMAN’S PARENTS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Chairperson, on behalf of the ACDP I give notice that I
shall move:

  That the House-


  (1) expresses its sadness and anger at the brutal killing of another
        innocent seven-year-old girl, Sheldean Human;


  (2) extends heartfelt condolences to the parents of little Sheldean,
        family members and friends, and prays that the Lord comfort and
        heal their broken hearts; and


  (3) commends all who worked tirelessly to find Sheldean, who was abducted
        from near her home in Pretoria last month.


The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon member, is that a motion without
notice?

Mrs C DUDLEY: It was notice of a motion.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): If I’m not mistaken, it would be more
suitably placed under motions without notice.

Mrs C DUDLEY: We just didn’t have time to get it through by 12 noon, as we
were in a Whips׳ meeting.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Anyway, considering the subject
matter, if there is no objection ... [Interjections.] I didn’t want to rule
it out of order; I wanted you to change it. I don’t want to rule this out
of order, because I find it very difficult to rule out of order a motion on
that subject.

Mrs C DUDLEY: I’m happy with that. Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): In which case I have to ask if there
were any objections. None. Okay, thank you.

Agreed to.
The House adjourned at 17:09.
