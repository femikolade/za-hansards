MINISTERS:

     Strategic management model to address science and technology system

49.   Mr T S Setona (ANC) asked the Minister of Science and Technology:

      How far is his department with the implementation of a new strategic
      management model to address the lack of a strategic approach to the
      management of the state-funded portion of the science and technology
      system?                                            C560E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, the Department
of Science and Technology has made substantial progress in the
implementation of the recommendations, as outlined in the approved Cabinet
memo of 6 October 2004 on the new strategic management model.

Some recommendations have been implemented and progress has been made with
others. The CSIR was transferred from the Department of Trade and Industry
to the Department of Science and Technology with effect from 1 April 2005.
The CSIR board was appointed for a period of three years, effective from 1
January 2006.

Budget options for regenerating the research and development capacity of
the CSIR was incorporated into the DST budget proposal to Treasury. The
National Treasury has gradually increased the baseline allocation for all
public entities.

Regarding the appointment of DST representatives onto boards reporting to
line departments, DST representatives were appointed to the boards of the
Agricultural Research Council, Mintek, National Energy Research Institute,
Water Research Commission, SA National Biodiversity Institute and the
Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa. The DST is still awaiting
appointment of a DST representative to the board of the Medical Research
Council, which would be completed once the memorandum of understanding with
the Department of Health is finalised.

The science Vote was dismantled with effect from 31 March 2005 and each
line department now budgets individually for its research institutions. The
DST has launched the science and technology managers’ forum to assist
sector-specific departments in developing a national research and
development plan that could be supported jointly.

Regarding the three-tiered MTEF Science and Technology expenditure plan,
National Treasury has indicated that this will be included in the overall
financial systems review and modifications in the 2007-08 financial year. I
am sure the Minister of Finance will confirm that, if need be.

The DST has completed phase one of the project which dealt with data
specifications, analysis and design concerning the implementation of the
three-tiered MTEF plans in provinces. The DST is ready to proceed with
phase two, which deals with systems design and implementation. The policy
on governance standards has been completed and is presently being
implemented by the science, engineering and technology institutions.
The policy framework for the intellectual property derived from publicly-
funded research has been developed and was approved by Cabinet in February
2006. A draft Bill is being prepared on this matter. Thank you,
Chairperson.

             Name-and-shame policy to enforce employment equity

50.   Ms J F Terblanche (DA) asked the Minister of Labour:


      Whether he will make a statement on the so-called name-and-shame
      policy to enforce employment equity, as reported on in the media
      recently?                                                     C1001E

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We move to the second question asked by Ms
Terblanche to the Minister of Labour. I don’t see the Minister of Labour in
the House. I am not sure whether there is any Minister who has perhaps been
requested to respond on his behalf?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Hon Chairperson, I am not responding on
behalf of the Minister but we have information that the hon Minister is
abroad. The information is that a written reply will be submitted to the
member via the office of the chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Ms Terblanche, can you allow my office to
follow that up.

              Tax on windfall profits in liquid fuels industry

51.   Ms J F Terblanche (DA) asked the Minister of Finance:

      (1)   Whether the Government intends instituting a tax on windfall
            profits in the liquid fuels industry; if not, what is the
            position in this regard; if so, what will be the impact of such
            a tax on the prospects to increase our inland liquid fuels
            production;


      (2)   whether he will make a statement on the matter?         C1002E

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chair, this matter has been dealt with for a while
now. The first time we raised it was in the Medium-Term Budget Policy
Statement, which I tabled in Parliament on 25 October 2005 – nobody
noticed.

We dealt with the matter subsequently in the Budget Review tabled in
Parliament on 15 February 2006 – nobody noticed it there. People insist
that I said something about taxing synthetic fuels in my Budget Speech on
15 February 2006, when in fact I didn’t say anything about it.

The task team has done its work. It has concluded its report. We indicated
in the Budget Review on 23 February this year that we would engage with the
industry and report by no later than 31 July.
As I stand here, Chair, I can say that there is ongoing discussion. There
is a task team formed at a technical level between, certainly, the
companies engaged in the production of synthetic fuels and the National
Treasury. From time to time the chief executives of the companies and I
confer. We are quite happy with the progress made by the task team.
Certainly, we will report to Parliament at a more appropriate time. Thank
you.

   Measures to record and control furniture leaving parliamentary villages

52.   Mr A Watson (DA) asked the Minister of Public Works:


      Whether any measures were instituted to record and control the
      unchecked loads of furniture leaving the parliamentary villages during
      the upgrading of houses for Members of Parliament and staff; if not,
      why not; if so, what are the relevant details?

                  C1003E

UNGQONGQOSHE WEZEMISEBENZI YOMPHAKATHI: Sihlalo, ngithanda nje ukusho
ukuthi lo mbuzo sengiwubuzwa okwesibili yiqembu elilodwa, yize-ke omunye
wawubuzwe eMkhandlwini kaZwelonke mayelana nokuthi izimpahla lezi
esizithatha ezindlini zaMalungu ePhalamende, njengoba silungisa e-Acacia
Park, ziye zishonephi; nokuthi ngabe ikhona yini indlela esizibheka ngayo
ukuze zingayi lapho kungafanele khona.

Ngifuna-ke ukuphendula ilungu elihloniphekile uWatson ngokulitshela ukuthi,
ngokomthetho, uma sisusa izimpahla, ikakhulukazi ezindlini kumbe ezakhiweni
zikahulumeni, noma ngabe kusemahhovisi noma ezindlini lapho kuhlala khona
amalungu eNdlu, siye sizithathe lezo zimpahla bese sibhala phansi ukuthi
yini esiyithathe endlini ethile, sizihambise-ke ezindaweni zoMnyango
Wezemisebenzi Yomphakathi zokugcina impahla.

Ngemuva kwalokho siye sibuze ezinye izinhlaka zikahulumeni noma iMinyango
ukuthi ngabe azikho yini izinto abazifunayo kulezo zimpahla esisuke
sizithathile. Siye sizinikeze leyo Minyango-ke uma izifuna. Uma leyo
Minyango ingazidingi, siyazithengisa endalini evulelekele noma ubani bese
imali etholakale lapho iye esikhwameni sikahulumeni. Kanjalo-ke nakulolu
hlelo lwezinto esizithathe e-Acacia Park, sisebenze ngaleyo ndlela.
Ngiyabonga, Sihlalo.

Mnu A WATSON: Sihlalo, ngithanda ukubuza ngilandelise kulowo mbuzo
obubuziwe ngaphambilini. Into engididayo maqondana nalezi zimpahla
ebezikulezi zindlu zaMalungu ePhalalamende e-Acacia Park ukuthi ngizibonele
ngamehlo ami zikhishwa ezindlini, zifakwa emalolini zabe seziphuma
ngesango. Angimbonanga-ke umabhalane obebala ukuthi zimpahla zini lezi
ezikhishwe ezindlini zafakwa elolini. Uma seziphuma-ke lezi mpahla ngesango
lase-Acacia Park, asazi ukuthi mhlawumbe lelo loli lizokuma endleleni yini
noma mhlawumbe ezinye zizowa yini. [Uhleko.] Iyona-ke le nto engididayo.
Mhlawumbe ungake uphinde ungichazele kabanzi ngaleyo ndaba? [Uhleko.]
UNGQONGQOSHE WEZEMISEBENZI YOMPHAKATHI: Sihlalo, ngiyabonga kwilungu
elihloniphekile. Manje-ke okubuhlungu ukuthi ilungu elihloniphekile lisuke
labhala phansi, langaphakamisa ucingo langitshela kuseyisikhathi ukuthi,
“Nakhu bo ngibona izimpahla zingena elolini! Phuthumani!” Kodwa-ke uma
ilungu linayo imininingwane ethize engangisiza, ngingathokoza ukuthi
ngiyithole ukuze ngenze uphenyo. Ngiyabonga kakhulu.

Mnu M A MZIZI: Okuvuka laphaya empendulweni kaNgqongqoshe, siselapho
ezimpahleni ezisuswayo ezindlini njengoba kulungiswa, ngakube uMnyango
kaNgqongqoshe wakubhekelela yini ukuthi kube khona abahloli abahlola lezi
zimpahla ezisusiwe, nokuthi eziphindiswayo zisazophindiselwa zonke yini
lapho kwakufanele ziphindele khona?

Ngibuza kanje ngoba kubonakala okuningi laphaya – ngiyakholwa
bazongifakazela bonke labo abasezindlini osekulungiswe kuzo – njengokuthi
ezinye zezimpahla ezazisusiwe azibange zisaphindiselwa ezindaweni
ezazithathwe kuzo ukuze zibe khona kulezo zindawo. Sisahlupheka namanje
sizama ukubiza labo ababelungisa, futhi sihlale sithi, “Wozani phela
nizoqedela umsebenzi.” Kodwa sebekhokhelwe laba bantu. Asiboni-ke ukuthi
lokhu ngabe kuyosisiza, ukuthi kuthi sekulungisiwe kepha kube khona ezinye
izinto esikhala ngazo, ezazikhona kodwa ezingasaphindiselwanga.

UNGQONGQOSHE WEZEMISEBENZI YOMPHAKATHI: Ngiyabonga kakhulu elungwini
elihloniphekile, uMzizi, ngombuzo eliwubuzile. Kodwa ekulungiseni kwethu
laphaya, ikakhulukazi e-Acacia Park nakwezinye-ke izindawo lapho silungisa
khona, sivamise ukukhuluma namalungu. Siye sibe nemihlangano yebhodi
yezokuphatha lapho sihlala khona sivumelane ukuthi sizokwenza lokhu
nalokhu, kule ndawo nakuleya ndawo. Ebhodini yezokuphatha izindawo
zamalungu, kuye kube khona amalungu amakomidi abahlali bakuleyo naleyo
paki. Siye sithembe-ke ukuthi lawo malungu aye abuyele emiphakathini
yasezindaweni zamalungu afike asho ukuthi, “Njengoba kuzokwenziwa lolu
hlelo lokulungisa kabusha, nazi izinto ezizokwenziwa, nazi ezinye ezingeke
zenziwe.”

Sengike ngaba nomhlangano namanye aMalungu Ephalamende kuleli sonto
elidlule. Ngokwami, isithombe engisitholile ukuthi, amaningi kulawa
makomidi abahlali awasebenzi. Ngiyaxolisa ngokusho njalo. Uthola ukuthi
aMalungu Ephalamende ezindaweni eziningi lapho ehlala khona awazi kahle hle
ngezinhlelo okuvunyelwene ngazo. Maqondana nalezo zinto osuzibalulile,
kwesinye isikhathi njengoba sisuke silungisa siye sivumelane ukuthi
sizozisusa zonke lezi zinto ezikhona. Ezinye zazo sizisusa ngoba
sezimoshakele kakhulu kanti ezinye ngoba singeke siphinde sizibuyisele,
ezinye mhlawumbe sisazozibuyisela. Kuba amalungu ashoyo-ke athi, “Cha,
yenzani ngale ndlela, ningenzi ngaleya ndlela.”

Nasi isibonelo: Esinye isikhalo esike savela kubantu abangomama abahlala
emapaki sithe, “Besinazo izitulwana zokuthi sizitomote sibe bahle laphaya,
kodwa manje sezisukile.” Siye sathi-ke, “Cha, siyakuzwa lokhu enikushoyo.
Impela besizithathile futhi singeke sisazibuyisela. Sizonibhekela
ezizohambisana nale fenisha esesiyifakile ukuze sibhekelele nezidingo zenu
zokuzilungisa nibe bahle.”

Sithemba-ke ukuthi lowo myalezo wafika komama abangabahlali ezindaweni
ezingamapaki ahlala amalungu. Uma ungafikanga, mangixolise. Kodwa
esivumelane ngakho nalawa malungu engihlangane nawo ngesonto elidlule
ukuthi sizophindela emhlanganweni webhodi bese siphinde sicela ukuhlangana
namakomidi abahlali ngepaki ngepaki.

Okunye esizokwenza, uma sizovumelana namalungu amaqembu ezepolitiki, ukuthi
sitshele amakhokhasi amaqembu ngamaqembu ngalokho esikwenza e-Acacia Park
ukuze siqinisekise ukuthi wonke umuntu oyiLungu lapha ePhalamende wazi
kahle ukuthi senzani, nokuthi inhloso yalokho ukuthi sifinyelele kuphi.

Mnu S SHICEKA: Sihlalo, ebengithanda ukukwazi nje ukuthi, ngabe kubantu
abenza umsebenzi, izinkontileka, sikhona yini esivumelwaneni isigatshana
sokubahlawulisa uma bengawenzi umsebenzi ngesikhathi? Ngingakusho
ngokunanazi ukuthi, lapho ngihlala khona mina, kuthatha isikhathi eside
kakhulu ngaphambi kokuba ilungiswe indlu. Ngicabanga  ukuthi manje
izinyanga zithi azibe ntathu ngaphuma. Sekungeyesine le nyanga kulungiswa
indlu yami yodwa. Manje angikabuyi nokubuyela endlini, ngisahlala endlini
encanyana laphaya. Zonke lezi zinyanga ezine kulokhu kulungiswa indlu
eyodwa?
Engifuna ukukwazi-ke ukuthi ngabe sikhona yini isigatshana sokubahlawulisa
laba bantu ngoba phela ngaleyo ndlela kusho ukuthi laba ngabantu
abazithathela amashansi, abangawazi umsebenzi wabo, abangazi nokuthi
kuyaphuthuma ukuthi abantu babuyele endaweni yabo yokuhlala, kwenzinwe
umsebenzi? Ngiyabonga, Sihlalo.

UNGQONGQOSHE WEZEMISEBENZI YOMPHAKATHI: Sihlalo, ngiyabonga kwilungu
elihloniphekile. Isigatshana sokuhlawulisa sihlale sikhona kuzo zonke
izivumelwano esizenzayo. Kodwa ngifuna ukubuyela emuva, ngoba, ikakhulukazi
uma silungisa izindawo lapho kuhlala khona abantu, noma ngabe amahhovisi,
okuningi kuye kushintshe kwesinye isikhathi.

Noma lukhona uhlaka lwesikhathi olubekiwe, uthola ukuthi uma sesibenzisana
namakomidi nalabo bantu abathintekile, kuke kuthiwe, “Cha, ake nime
kancane. Ningangeni ngempelasonto. Ake nime kancane ningakwenzi ukuthi
nokuthi.” Lokho kwandisa izinsuku. Ngesinye isikhathi lokho kusuke
kungelona iphutha lenkontileka. Ngesinye isikhathi inkinga iba sekutheni,
thina nalabo bantu esisebenzisana nabo ekulungiseni leso sizinda kumbe leyo
ndlu yiziphi izinkinga esihlangabezana nazo.

Yingakho-ke ngithe sizohlangana kanye nebhodi lezokuphatha zonke izindawo
ezihlala amalungu, siphinde sihlale namakomidi abahlali, ngoba kucacile
ukuthi abaningi – ngokuzwa kwethu uma sikhuluma nalaba bantu abeza bazobika
udaba – abazanga ukuthi uhlelo luzohamba kanjani, izinkinga ezibikiwe
kwenziwe njani ngazo. Njengokuthi nje uma sithe, mhlawumbe, masi-ke sime
lapha ngomsebenzi.

Ngakho-ke sithola ukuthi thina siyakhuluma nebhodi kodwa amalungu ekomidi
labahlali angayi konitshela ukuthi, “Nazi izinkinga. Nithi masenze njani?”
Yingenxa yalokho-ke sesithi mhlawumbe sesizokwenza okungemnandi ngokuthi
sithi ake siye kokhuluma namalungu ngqo manje ukuze sizwe wona ukuthi
athini ngalolu daba.

USIHLALO  WOMKHANDLU  KAZWELONKE  WEZIFUNDAZWE:   Usekhona   omunye   umbuzo
wokugcina?  Uma  ungekho  siyadlula.  UNgqongqoshe  ubecelile  ukuthi  asale
esephendula  nombuzo  wesibili.  Ngiye  ngamvumela  ukuthi   enze   kanjalo.
Ngiyethemba  ukuthi  ozakwabo  ngeke  bakhubeke  ngoba  bake   bangithethisa
kabuhlungu  ngelinye  ilanga.   Ungaqhubeka-ke   Ngqongqoshe   nombuzo   58,
okungumbuzo  obuzwe  uWindvoel  kuNgqongqoshe   Wezemisebenzi   Yomphakathi.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, I would  like  to  mention  that
this particular question is being asked for the second time  now,  at  least
by one political party. The question was first asked by a certain member  in
the National Assembly. The member wanted to know as  to  where  we  put  the
items that we remove from  members’  houses  at  Acacia  Park  parliamentary
village as we are busy with renovations there. The  member  also  wanted  to
know whether we have any monitoring mechanisms in place to  make  sure  that
such items do not go where they are not supposed to go.
I want to respond to the hon member Watson by telling him that, by  law,  if
we remove such items, particularly in government buildings,  be  it  offices
or even houses where members  reside,  we  normally  take  those  items  and
record their serial numbers and the  houses  from   which  such  items  were
removed. After that we then take such items to the storehouse  belonging  to
the Department of Public Works.

After that we ask other government structures or government  departments  if
there is anything that they need from the items that we have taken. We  then
give them to those departments if they need them. If  those  departments  do
not need them, we  then  auction  them  off  and  the  proceeds  go  to  the
government account. The same process will also apply to  the  items  removed
from Acacia Park parliamentary village. Thank you, Chairperson.

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, I would like to ask  a  follow-up  question.  What
confuses me about these items which were in the houses  of  the  Members  of
Parliament at Acacia Park, is that I  saw  these  items  being  removed  and
loaded onto trucks and the trucks drove off with them. I  did  not  see  any
clerk recording the serial numbers of the items which were removed from  the
houses. And we  do  not  know  whether  the  said  truck  stopped  somewhere
immediately after leaving Acacia Park parliamentary village and other  items
could have fallen off the truck along  the  way.  [Laughter.]  And  this  is
exactly  what  confuses  me.  Can  you  perhaps  elaborate  on  that  issue?
[Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, I thank  the  hon  member.  Well,
the problem here is that the hon member decided to  write  this  down  as  a
question. The member could have picked up the telephone  and  called  me  to
say, “I see items here being loaded onto a truck!  Hurry  up!”  However,  if
the member has certain information that could help me, I would be  happy  if
such information could be  forwarded  to  me  so  that  I  can  conduct  the
necessary investigation. Thank you very much.

Mr M A MZIZI: A follow-up question on the  Minister’s  response.  Whilst  we
are still on that issue of the items which were removed from the  houses  as
they were being renovated, I wish to know whether the department had a  plan
to have inspectors to monitor the movement of the said items  as  they  were
being removed from the houses. This would have helped in  making  sure  that
items go where they were supposed to go and that  those  which  were  to  be
returned would be returned without hassles.

I am asking this question because many of the items which were removed  from
different houses were not all returned, despite  those  houses  having  been
renovated. Certain items were not even taken back to the houses  from  which
they were removed. We still hopelessly run after those who  were  renovating
the houses to come and finish their job. Yet these people have already  been
paid for this job. We therefore, do not  believe  this  is  helping  anybody
because whilst we are supposed to be happy about  the  renovations,  we  are
still not happy about certain items that are not been returned.

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Thank you very much,  hon  member  Mzizi,  for
the question you asked. Generally when we do our  renovations,  particularly
in  Acacia  Park  parliamentary  village  and  other  areas  where  we   are
renovating, we usually consult members. We  would  hold  meetings  with  the
regulatory board where we sit down and agree on what  is  going  to  happen,
where, and how. Usually, the  regulatory  board  monitoring  the  renovation
process would consist of residents of that  particular  area.  We  generally
believe that those people forming part of  the  regulatory  board  would  go
back to the community of members and report that, “As we are going  to  have
this renovating programme, here are the things which are going to  be  done,
and here are the things which are not going to be done.”

I had a meeting with other Members of Parliament last week.  The  impression
I got was that, most of these committees are dysfunctional and  I  am  sorry
to say that. You find that Members of Parliament, in most places where  they
live, do not really know about the programmes that we agreed on.

With regard to those crucial things, sometimes during  our  renovations,  we
agree that we are going to remove certain things. Some of them  are  removed
because they are damaged  and  they  are  not  returned  whilst  others  are
returned. It’s usually members who dictate to us that, “No, do it this  way,
don’t do it that way, etc.”

Here is an example: One of the complaints we received  from  female  members
who stay in parliamentary villages was that they had chairs in their  houses
which they used for  their  make-up,  and  those  chairs  were  removed.  We
responded by telling them  that  we  understand  their  complaint  to  be  a
genuine one. That was very true because we had  indeed  removed  the  chairs
there and we were not going to return them, but we told them  that  we  were
going to look for the ones that would match those chairs and place  them  in
their houses so as to cater for the beauty needs of the female members.

We just hope that this message reached the female  members  staying  at  the
parliamentary villages. If it did not reach them, I apologise, but  what  we
are agreed upon with the members that I met last week was that we are  going
to have a meeting with  the  regulatory  board  and  then  ask  for  another
meeting with the residents committee for each parliamentary village.

The other thing that we are going  to  do,  if  we  agree  with  members  of
political parties, is to inform the parties’  caucuses  about  what  we  are
doing at Acacia Park parliamentary village for the purpose  of  making  sure
that everybody who is a Member of Parliament knows what we  are  doing,  and
the reasoning behind it.

Mr S SHICEKA: Chairperson, I want to know  whether  you  have  a  policy  in
place which guides  the  people  who  do  the  job  for  you,  that  is  the
contractors, and a policy that would  enable  the  department  to  fine  the
contractors if they do not finish their job on time. I can say  without  any
fear of contradiction that where I stay, it takes a long time to renovate  a
house. I think it is now  approximately  three  months  since  I  left  that
house. This is the fourth month  now  and  only  my  house  is  still  being
renovated. I have not yet returned to that house. I am still  staying  in  a
small house  there.  Now,  for  the  entire  four  months,  are  they  still
renovating one house?

What I actually want to know is whether there is any policy in  place  which
can be used to fine these people if they are found to be wanting because  we
cannot allow this to go on like this, with these people  taking  chances  as
they are doing. One can even see that these people do not  know  their  job,
and they are not even aware that people have  to  return  to  their  houses.
What must be done? Thank you, Chairperson.

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson,  I  thank  the  hon  member  very
much. There is always a provision for fines in all contracts that  we  sign.
However I, want to go back a little bit because,  when  we  renovate  houses
and offices, certain things sometimes change.

There is usually a time frame, but you find that in certain instances as  we
work with committees and other stakeholders, it  is  these  very  committees
and stakeholders who would say to contractors, “No,  man,  can  you  suspend
your operations a little bit. Do not work on weekends. Do not  do  this  and
that.” All this increases the number of days for  that  particular  project.
Sometimes that is not the fault of  the  contactor.  Sometimes  the  problem
would be the many hindrances that we and our contractors who renovate  those
centres or houses come across.

That is why I therefore said to you that we will  meet  with  the  board  in
charge of places where members live, and also  the  residents  committee  to
discuss this matter. It is clear to us – taking all your views into  account
– that not all things were  reported  to  you.  They  did  not  explain  the
unforeseen problems that could occur and the results thereof, like when  the
contractors are told to put the renovating process on hold.

What actually happens is that whilst we do  talk  with  the  board  and  the
residents committee, they in turn do not go back to you to report  and  say,
“Here are the problems that we have. What must we do?” It  is  against  this
background now that we are going to do what we did not want to do.  We  will
approach the members directly and hear  what  they  are  saying  about  this
matter.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any other follow-up question? If
none, then let us proceed. The Minister requested to also respond to the
second question, and I agreed. I hope that her colleagues will not be
saddened by that because I remember the other day when they admonished me
seriously. Minister, you can now continue with question 58, which was asked
by the hon Windvoël to the Minister of Public Works.]

   Employment through Expanded Public Works Programme, and steps to ensure
       local communities benefit from 2010 Soccer World Cup tournament
                                preparations

58.   Mr V V Z Windvoël (ANC) asked the Minister of Public Works:

      (1)   How many people have been employed in each province through the
            Expanded Public Works Programme since its establishment;


      (2)   whether any links have been established with companies involved

[The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, I would like to thank you for
allowing me to briefly answer all my questions. I have made this request to
all my colleagues and they have allowed me to proceed. I therefore do not
expect that any of them will raise any concerns as previously done.

The question asked by the hon Mr Windvoël was, how many people have got
jobs through the Expanded Public Works Programme, since its inception?
Secondly, he wanted to know what we were doing to ensure co-operation with
the various construction companies especially those involved in building
stadiums and other infrastructure necessary for the 2010 soccer games.

In response to that, I would like to say that since the year 2004, at the
initiation of the Expanded Public Works Programme, to December 2006, 573
269 people got employment opportunities.

To give an exact account according to each province, seeing that this was
his question specifically: In the Eastern Cape there were 4952, in the Free
State 37 784, in Gauteng 108 894, in KwaZulu-Natal 182 905, in Limpopo 37
399, in Mpumalanga 43 932, in the Northern Cape 25 070, in the North West
23 786 and in the Western Cape 63 551.
When we looked at these numbers we were indeed very happy with the work
that we had done, but upon closer inspection as government, we found that
there is still much that can be done to improve them.  That is why we are
now looking at the different options available to improve the possibilities
of job creation.

One other thing that can be said is, yes, maybe we have not been
communicating adequately with relevant people in the different industries
because one, in fact, would be asking them to go beyond their call of duty.
But I am glad that the ones we have been in contact with have been keen to
work with us.

At this point we are in the process of talking to people in the Mbombela
Municipality to see whether they cannot take a certain number of children
from the National Youth Development Programme, to train them in the
specialised fields so that they may employ them in the building of the
train tracks.

I hope than even other companies when we approach them and negotiating as
we are doing, they will agree to work with us in creating job opportunities
and empowering the youth with skills.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I thank the Minister for his
reply. I would just like to make a request - since he was quick in giving
these replies - that he makes available to me a copy of the numbers that
were being quoted, according to each province.
I hope that the Minister will be able to assist us in this regard, so that
even the representatives of the different provinces may have access to them
as we each return to our respective provinces. This report will also assist
us to present it in its original form.

Another thing that I would like to know is whether there are any words of
advice that the Minister may give us, so that, as Members of Parliament, we
can continue to encourage co-operation amongst key industry role players.

Regarding youth development programmes, the aim is that they work with
industries in the different provinces through programmes such as the TSB
that we have and the SEBI in Mpumalanga. I would also like to know from the
Minister if there is a part that he feels can be played by Members of
Parliament in this regard.

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, the written reply is available
and I would be happy to make it available to the hon Windvoël. It is now up
to him to make copies for the rest of the members.

In reply to the second question that the member asked, I will not take up
much of the members’ and the Ministers’ time as was allocated to me because
I trust that I will be here with you on Thursday when we talk about the
Budget allocation to the Department of Public works; in which case I will
be in a position to explain in detail what role the members can play. This
will assist us to get the role-players in the industry to work with us
especially in the Youth Development Programme. I thank you.]

 Measures to curb issuing of illegal driving licences and amend regulations
                     iro new credit card format licences

53.   Mr A Watson (DA) asked the Minister of Transport:

      (1)   Whether any measures are in place to curb the issuing of illegal
            driving licences; if not, why not; if so, what measures;


      (2)   whether he will consider amending the regulations for replacing
            old type driving licences with the new credit card driving
            licences by (a) relaxing present measures that compel late
            applicants to apply de novo for driving licences and (b)
            imposing heavy fines of as much as R100,00 for late
            applications, in addition to the normal statutory fees; if not,
            why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                        C1004E

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: This question is from Mr Watson and is
directed to the Minister of Transport. I am informed that the Deputy
Minister of Science and Technology will stand in for the Minister because
the Minister is abroad. I now hand over to the hon Deputy Minister to
answer the question.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (on behalf of the Minister of
Transport): Chairperson, yes, several measures are in place to curb the
issuing of illegal driving licences.

The manner in which a driving licence is to be issued is legislated in the
National Road Traffic Act. This Act also governs the manner in which an
examiner of driving licences should be registered, as well as the
registration of driving licence testing centres. In addition to this, the
legislation prescribes the powers and duties of the inspectorate of driving
licences.

Emanating from the legislation, the National Traffic Information System
also has several measures in place to ensure that legislation requirements
are adhered to. A new component to the eNatis will be introduced soon, in
order to further curb fraud in the environment of bookings for driving
licences. The eNatis was also enhanced to create audit trails for all
transactions performed, including queries. The driving licence book
component is already part of the eNatis and will endeavour to address fraud
currently being experienced with regard to block bookings by driving
schools, for example. This component will also ensure that we have an audit
trail of bookings made, for audit purposes.

It is envisaged that this component will be activated within the next month
or so, or as soon as the environment has stabilised, after the introduction
of the new eNatis system. The Department of Transport further endeavours to
implement the computerised learner’s licence test. This will curb fraud, in
the sense that applicants will not be able to obtain questions prior to the
test.

The department, in conjunction with the Special Investigating Unit,
conducts investigations and audits on a national basis at all testing
centres and registering authorities. It is part of a master plan to root
out fraud and corruption in the field of driving licence management. The
role-players, together with the Department of Transport, are the National
Intelligence Agency, the South African Police Service, the Directorate of
Special Operations and, as mentioned previously, the Special Investigating
Unit.

The second part of the question’s answer is rather lengthy. If you are
happy if I proceed, I will do so. I’ve tried to reduce it a little bit, on
behalf of the Minister of Transport, but it is a bit on the lengthy side.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You may continue.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: I should proceed? Thank you.
It is important to note that there are two issues related to this question.
The first one relates to the old driving licences contained in the green
identity book, and the second relates to old paper card driving licences
issued in former self-governing territories and those issued to persons
without identity documents.

Starting off with the old driving licences contained in the green identity
book: A notice appeared in the Government Gazette 25001, dated 28 February
2003, which determined the date on which all identity book licences
referred to in section 18(6) of the National Road Traffic Act became
invalid on 1 May 2003. All identity document driving licence holders who
failed to convert to the credit card format driving licence are no longer
in possession of a driving licence that is valid to drive within South
Africa. Holders of identity document driving licences will therefore be
expected to go through the process of applying for a learner’s licence
through to the actual K53 driving test.

A notice was published in the Government Gazette dated 7 October 2003 for
the purpose of providing exemptions for certain classes of persons who
failed to convert. I won’t run through the exemptions for now, but it will
be available to the hon member. If the person concerned was at any stage
unable to apply between the period of 1 March 1998 and 30 April 2003 owing
to any one of these exemptions, the person concerned was therefore unable
to apply as required in the first sentence of section 18(6)(b) of the Act.
For example, if a person was detained for only one day during the period,
the person concerned was therefore unable to apply.
When the holder of a driving licence contained in a South African identity
document returns to South Africa and qualifies for exemption to convert the
driving licence, such a person must apply within six months after their
return to South Africa for the conversion of the said licence. This
exemption does not permit such a person, however, to drive on roads until
conversion has taken place and a temporary driving licence is issued. The
department is currently considering terminating the provision for
exemptions based on the presumption that people who had legitimate identity
book type of driving licences had ample and reasonable time to convert,
should they previously have been unable to do so.

Referring to the old paper card driving licences issued in former self-
governing territories and those issued to persons without identity
documents, the driving licence of the former TBVC countries and the self-
governing territories may still be converted to the new credit card driving
licence. The Department of Transport is currently considering terminating
this provision on the presumption that people who had legitimate old-type
driving licences had ample and reasonable time to convert, should they
previously have been unable to do so.

There are fines in respect of law enforcement and penalties when a person
converts his/her licence late. There are also two aspects when a person is
stopped and checked in terms of driving licences. Both are dealt with in
terms of section 12 of the National Road Transport Act. Firstly, a person
must have a valid licence issued to him/her in terms of the National Road
Traffic Act for the type of vehicle he/she is driving; and, secondly, the
person must have proof of such driving licence on his/her person.

Should a person be stopped and such a person is not able to produce proof
of driving licence, the officer may charge the person for not having a
licence. If the person can later prove that he/she does have a licence
issued to him/her, the charge may be reduced to driving without proof of a
licence. The fines in respect of not being able to produce a valid licence
or proof thereof are determined by the various magistrate’s offices and not
by the Department of Transport. Penalties in the case of the old TBVC and
self-governing territory licences are still to be considered. Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): As we know, the Deputy Minister
was responding on behalf of the Minister of Transport. It will be up to the
Deputy Minister whether he will take follow-up questions. Hon Deputy
Minister, are you going to take any follow-up questions?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, I believe the
hon member doesn’t insist on asking a follow-up question today. [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Hon Watson, do you want to ask any
follow-up questions?

Mr A WATSON: Madam, I think it would be unfair to ask a follow-up question,
but I would like to say that the Minister has unfortunately missed my
point. And I am not going to expect the stand-in Minister to take that up.

I think where Ministers are unable to answer questions in the House because
they are overseas, I would plead that we rather postpone the question than
to miss the opportunity to engage with a particular Minister.

I would like to thank you very much for the reply you gave. It is very
extensive, but, unfortunately, it has missed the point. And, to quote
eNatis at this stage, I think, is not a very good reference. Thank you.
I’ll put one in writing.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Hon Watson, I think you are a
member of the transport committee. Probably, it will be proper if you can
just put those questions in that committee because the Minister is not
here. I am saying you are member of the transport committee and perhaps the
questions that you wanted to put as follow-up questions could be raised at
committee level?

   Fund to provide financial assistance to SMMEs in Northern Cape tourism
                                  industry

54.   Ms B L Matlhoahela (ID) asked the Minister of Environmental Affairs
      and Tourism:

      Whether his department has created any fund to provide financial
      assistance to small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) in the
      tourism industry in the Northern Cape; if not, why not; if so, (a)
      since when has this fund been operating, (b)(i) how many and (ii)
      which SMMEs have benefited since its inception, (c) how many jobs have
      been created as a result of this fund and (d) who manages the fund?
                       C1005E

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): We will proceed to Question 54. I
am informed that the Minister is abroad, but the answer has been tabled. We
will give a copy of that answer to the members.

  Settlement agreement on agri-units for Griqua community in Northern Cape
                                  districts

55.   Ms B L Matlhoahela (ID) asked the Minister for Agriculture and Land
      Affairs:

      (1)   How many agri-units were agreed to in the settlement agreement
            on agri-units to the Griqua community in Bucklands, Herbert
            District and Douglas in the Northern Cape;


      (2)   whether there were any negotiations regarding additional agri-
            units for settlement; if not, what is the position in this
            regard; if so, what are the relevant details?      C1006E

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson, the
answer is quite short. Bucklands community consists of Xhosa people,
Batswana and Griqua people. When this settlement process was under way,
nine state-owned agricultural farms were offered to the Bucklands communal
property association. The state is in the process of transferring these
nine farms to the communal properties association.

The original claim of the community was for 21 farms, which included 12
privately owned farms. The matter of these 12 privately owned farms has
been referred to court. I’m sorry that we cannot give more information at
this stage until the proceedings of the court have been finalised.

It is a very interesting place. I’ve been there. It’s where the Vaal and
Gariep Rivers run together, near Douglas. It’s beautiful land. It’s
extremely valuable for possible tourism, game farming, agriculture and
irrigation. We are awaiting the outcome of the court process. Thank you.
       Assistance provided in establishment and support of franchises

     56. Mr V V Z Windvoël (ANC) asked the Minister of Trade and Industry:

      (a) How many people were assisted by his department or any entities
      under his department to establish franchises since 2006, (b) how many
      of these franchises were established in each province and (c) what
      support are they receiving?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H Davies): Chairperson, the
answer to part (a) of the question is that the Industrial Development
Corporation has a programme which has assisted 138 franchises to create 3
500 jobs, and the National Empowerment Fund has supported eight franchises
with funding, creating 232 jobs.

In respect of part (b), I can provide the hon member with a schedule, and
this shows that the IDC’s support programme has supported franchises in all
nine provinces. The total investment has been R207 million. Ranked by
investment, the first of these is Gauteng, followed by the Western Cape,
North West, Eastern Cape and then KwaZulu-Natal.

The National Empowerment Fund programme has supported franchises in three
provinces, with an investment value of R20 million. The biggest is in the
Eastern Cape, followed by Gauteng and then the Northern Cape.

With respect to part (c), operational support is normally provided by the
franchisor in the form of site location, quality control, accounting
systems, start-up practices and management training, and this is over and
above the right to sell goods and services from the franchisor. If the
Industrial Development Corporation deems it necessary that the franchisee
needs additional support, such assistance can be provided from the IDC
business support programme.

As far as the National Empowerment Fund is concerned, it has a dedicated
post-investment management unit which offers mentorship services to those
small enterprise owners, business people and franchisees in the general NEF
portfolio. However, because franchisees are, by definition, operating an
existing and proven business model, they are less likely to require this
type of support than stand-alone small, medium and micro enterprise
operators. Moreover, many franchisors run their own mentorship programme
for franchisees. That said, any franchisee can, at any point, access
business support services and mentorship through the post-investment
management unit at the National Empowerment Fund.

The Small Enterprise Development Agency’s franchise support programme
focuses on providing information and advice on matters relating to
franchising when an entrepreneur considers that route into business. In the
past financial year, Seda has held franchise information workshops
throughout the provinces, and participated in franchise exhibitions which
were mainly demand-driven in conjunction with their branches. Over 1 000
people attended these events.

Recently, Seda entered into a partnership with Hotdog Café and Builders’
Warehouse, with a view to creating opportunities for 20 young entrepreneurs
from previously disadvantaged backgrounds. This project is being piloted in
Gauteng province, and will be rolled out to the rest of the country later.
Both Seda and the Hotdog Café will contribute to the training of the
franchisees who will undergo a six-month training course. Thank you.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: House Chairperson, I thank the Deputy
Minister for the offer to hand over the written response.

There is this mushrooming of plaza shopping complexes in the townships. In
most instances, you find that there are some of these franchises in those
shopping complexes. Most of the time, you find that the local people only
participate in these franchises by giving their labour; they are not part
of the ownership of those establishments.

Is the department perhaps considering coming up with a kind of BEE charter
framework which will ensure that a certain percentage of the ownership of
those franchises in the local shopping complexes takes on board the people
in the local communities? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H Davies): Chairperson, I
think that the question of decisions of who gets franchises and so on is
largely a decision of the franchisors. I think it’s a model which we should
say is a potential model of entry for BEE operators, because it is already
a proven business operation and so on. But I don’t think that we should
assume that all franchises are necessarily good in all respects, and I
think that’s the basis on which Seda is prepared to offer advice and
counselling, and also the other programmes that I mentioned.

With respect to charters for shopping complexes and so on, I think that the
codes of good practice for BEE would apply, and would apply to any industry
or sector which is seeking to do business with government, or is seeking
access to regulatory benefits and so on. I am not actually aware of a
process particularly for the development of a charter for plazas and that
sector, but the broader code of practice would, in any case, apply to all
industries and sectors, whether or not they have a charter. Thank you.

     Request for more land for yacht business at Cape Town Harbour, and
              attention to be given to ship-repairing business

57.   Ms N D Ntwanambi (ANC) asked the Minister for Public Enterprises:

      (1)   Whether he will request more land for the yacht business at Cape
            Town Harbour, as this is an international sport; if not, why
            not; if so, what are the relevant details;


      (2)   whether the ship-repairing business at Cape Town Harbour will
            also be given attention; if not, why not; if so, what are the
            relevant details?                                       C1008E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam Chair ...
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): No, this question is for the
Minister for Public Enterprises, the hon Alec Erwin.

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Thank you, Chairperson. It is bad when
Science and Technology start to coup Public Enterprises. But we work very
closely together, so I am happy for him to answer if he wants to.

Chairperson, I did actually deal with this during our debate, but let me
just say that I am personally very supportive of the ship-building and
yacht-building industry, having been party to that in its early days. The
difficulty we face is that in the designs we have had for the Cape Town
harbour, we had made more space for both the ship repair and possible boat
and yacht-building activity. But, unfortunately, the process to extend the
container terminal is proving to be very complex indeed, with objections
mainly from the residents on the coastline to the north of the harbour.
This delay is proving quite a difficult one, so we now have to redesign
large parts of the port. Instead of using the expansion of the existing
container terminal to enlarge the container terminal, we may have to
redesign and pull the containers back. It is not optimal, and is causing us
some difficulty.

So I am afraid, at this point, we cannot make any major or final decisions
on exactly what we will do there, but we would certainly want to provide
more space for both boatbuilding and ship repair.
Nks N D NTWANAMBI: Ewe Mama uSihlalo ndinawo apha umbuzo olandelayo.
Mphathiswa, phaya eCulemborg, kumhlaba kaTransnet, ikhona indawo endicinga
ukuba iikhonteyina zingakwazi ukuhlala kuyo, ngoba zona azidingi manzi
njengezinye ezi bendithetha ngazo kula mbuzo wam. Kunganjani ke ukuba isebe
linokuyijonga nayo loo ndawo? (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Yes, Chairperson, I do have a supplementary question.
Minister, at Culemborg in the Transnet area, there is a spot at which I
think we can place these containers because they do not require water like
the ones I have referred to in my previous question. Would the department
perhaps consider that?]

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chairperson, hon member, we need to
consider all those areas, because in an efficient container terminal you
need to stack the containers and then move them quickly to where they can
be shipped onwards. In Cape Town it is not so common, but it can be that
there could be transhipment. Mainly in the Cape, it is containers coming
into the Cape economy and a smaller number going into the hinterland, or
the economy of the interior. Big distances between offloading and where you
are stacking, and where you want to tranship are not the most efficient
design for a container terminal. So the way we will design that area is
proving fairly complex. As I indicated, it is not an optimal situation. The
costs of building new container facilities elsewhere are very high, indeed.
In any event, in order to service Cape Town and surrounding economy we need
more space.

So we are considering those options. We are considering the section just
behind the current container terminal, but it poses a number of problems
regarding how we move the trucks in and the trains out. It is causing us to
have to redesign at some length.

 Progress in implementing traffic control systems with a view to 2010 Soccer
                            World Cup tournament

59.   Mr V V Z Windvoël (ANC) asked the Minister of Transport:

      (1)   What progress is his department making in ensuring that all
            provinces, particularly the ones that will host events relating
            to the 2010 Soccer World Cup tournament, implement traffic
            control systems to improve traffic flow and road safety;


      (2)   whether the current pool of traffic officials will be sufficient
            to meet the demands of the hosting of the 2010 Soccer World Cup
            tournament; if not,


      (3)   whether his department has taken any steps in this regard; if
            not, why not; if so, what steps?                   C1011E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (on behalf of Minister of
Transport): Chairperson, hon member, I think the answer is very clear. The
two national committees, the Law Enforcement Technical Committee and the
Public Transport Enforcement Committee, as well as a number of special 2010
Soccer World Cup preparatory committees at provincial and local authority
levels, have been established to discuss road traffic management in a
holistic fashion for the 2010 World Cup and beyond.

The Road Traffic Management Corporation’s directorate of enforcement co-
ordination, together with all provinces and many local authorities, are
involved in the rolling enforcement plan, which focuses on co-ordinated law-
enforcement actions throughout the year. Special patrol units will also be
established, first in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and the Free
State, and then in the rest of the provinces. These units will comprise
specially trained traffic officers in fully equipped vehicles, who will
monitor hazardous locations and attend to special operations in their
respective areas of jurisdictions.

Regarding the second part of the question, the current number of registered
traffic officers will not be sufficient to meet the estimated demands and
to ensure free flow of traffic and promote safety.

Regarding the third part of the question, the traffic training colleges
will increase their capacity, and the maximum possible intake of trainee
officers who meet the entry requirements will be accepted and trained. The
implementation of the new year-long qualification has been placed on hold,
and the status quo, the six-month course – with regard to the training of
traffic officers - has been recommended until the traffic training colleges
cater for the needs of 2010.

The Road Traffic Management Corporation has also offered assistance to
traffic training colleges in regard to the facilitation and assessment of
trainee officers. The possibility of training people as peace officers is
also being investigated. This may pose a challenge, as the officers will be
restricted in their powers because they will not be able to stop vehicles.
Thank you.

 Measures to ensure that certain enterprises and groups are beneficiaries of
                    the 2010 Soccer World Cup tournament

60.   Mr V V Z Windvoël (ANC) asked the Minister of Trade and Industry:

      (1)   Whether his department has put any measures in place to ensure
            that local communities are active economic beneficiaries of the
            2010 Soccer World Cup tournament prior to and during the event;
            if not, why not; if so, what measures;
      (2)   whether such measures take into consideration the role of small,
            medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs), as active participants, in
            the economic activities that are geared towards the preparation
            for this tournament; if not, why not; if so, what are the
            relevant details;


      (3)   whether these measures identify the youth, people with
            disabilities, women and rural communities as key beneficiaries;
            if not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                              C1013E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Ms E Thabethe): Chairperson, we
need to recognise that the Soccer World Cup in 2010 is a Fifa event which
is being hosted in South Africa. In this regard, the principal
responsibilities of the state are to create an enabling environment for a
successful Fifa event and to maximise the economic impact by empowering
local enterprises to take advantage of related opportunities.

The DTI is in the main charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the
2010 Fifa World Cup is treated as a protected event in terms of the
Merchandise Marks Act. Under this Act, no legal person is allowed to
associate themselves with the event without the permission of the
organisers, particularly through practices known as ambush marketing.

Mega events may be designated as protected, provided that the event is in
the public interest, and that the organisers create opportunities for local
businesses, in particular those from previously disadvantaged communities.
In this respect, the Minister of Trade and Industry is satisfied that the
2010 Fifa World Cup will be in the public interest and that opportunities
will be created for local businesses, in particular small, medium and micro
enterprises.

Further, the DTI has negotiated that 30% of the budget of the Local
Organising Committee will be allocated to BEE and SMME businesses for
procurement purposes. The BEE Act and the codes of good practice will
inform tendering procedures of the Local Organising Committee.

The DTI has been mandated to analyse certain government instruments that
have an impact on the organisation of mega sporting events in South Africa,
and the DTI has identified the following areas in particular: firstly, the
Merchandise Marks Act, which deals with actions against ambush marketing;
secondly, infrastructure development for mega events which can benefit
local communities after the event such as roads and rail; thirdly, public
sector procurement instruments, which may include alignment of the
Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act, and the Broad-based Black
Economic Empowerment Act, and other procurement activities linked to the
2010 World Cup programme; and, business development service interventions
that need to be refocused and upscaled to support the ability of small
enterprises to access the procurement opportunities arising from this
event.

Regarding the second part of the question, both procurement legislation,
that is broad-based black economic empowerment, and the Preferential
Procurement Act, as well as business support services as described above
are geared towards appropriating the greatest possible share of World Cup
benefits for small, medium and micro enterprises. Moreover, the DTI has an
agreement with the Local Organising Committee that will see 30% of the
procurement spend going to SMME and BEE enterprises.
The answer to the third part is that the DTI, in conjunction with other
departments and spheres of government, intends to host workshops aimed at
establishing how local enterprises, youth, people with disabilities, women
and rural communities can benefit from World-Cup-related projects. Thank
you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Hon members, I am informed that
the Minister is abroad, and therefore question 61 will stand over.

  Advantage of National Credit Regulator, and steps to scrap accounts older
                              than three years

62.   Ms N D Ntwanambi (ANC) asked the Minister of Trade and Industry:

      (1)   What will the advantage of the National Credit Regulator be to
            an ordinary person;


      (2)   whether any steps have been taken to ensure that accounts older
            than three years are scrapped so that they are not used against
            the account holder(s) when applying for credit; if not, why not;
            if so, what steps?          C1022E


The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H Davies): Chairperson, the
response to the first part of the question is that section 12 of the
National Credit Act establishes the National Credit Regulator and mandates
the NCR to promote and support the development of a fair, transparent,
accessible and responsible credit market. Through the Act the National
Credit Regulator will ensure the protection of consumer rights in the
credit market, such as the consumer’s right to apply for credit and be
protected against discrimination; the right to receive information in plain
and understandable language; and the right of the consumer to raise
complaints with the alternative dispute resolution agents, the ombud
schemes such as the banking ombud, and the National Credit Regulator as
well.

Overindebted consumers will have access to debt counselling services at
minimal cost. The National Credit Regulator is also responsible for
regulating the level of interest and fees payable on credit transactions,
thus avoiding the exploitation of consumers. Market players such as credit
granters, credit bureaus and debt counsellors are required to be registered
with the National Credit Regulator, ensuring that their behaviour is
monitored at all times. Through the public awareness and education
programmes of the National Credit Regulator, ordinary consumers will get to
know their rights and how to exercise them.

The answer to the second part is that the National Credit Act and its
regulations limit periods for which different types of credit bureau
information may be kept. For instance, adverse classifications of consumer
behaviour can be kept for one year, adverse classifications of enforcement
action for two years, and information relating to enquiries can be kept for
two years and a consumer’s positive payment profile for five years.

Civil courts judgments are generally kept on a consumer’s record for five
years. However, a special dispensation was introduced in terms of the Act,
which allows for the earlier removal of information on certain types of
judgments. Some of the most important categories that are affected are the
following. Civil court judgments of up to R500 as of 1 September 2006 will
be removed on 1 June 2007, as long as there are not more than two such
unpaid judgments; civil court judgments of up to R5000 as of 1 September
2006 will be removed on 1 June 2007, as long as the judgment is older than
18 months and the consumer does not have more than two such unpaid
judgments; and civil court judgments of up to R50 000 that were reflected
on the consumer’s record on 1 September 2006 will be removed if the full
amount of the judgment was paid by the consumer on 1 September 2007. Thank
you.

Nksz N D NTWANAMBI: Ndiyabulela Sihlalo, isicelo sam sesokuba uBawo uSekela
Mphathiswa andiphe eza mpendulo zakhe ngoku, kaloku ingxaki wena yeyokuba
ndingumntu apha olihomba ngeendlebe. Ngelinye ixesha kuba nzima ukuva.
Kwakhona ke nantsi enye into, ingaba isebe lakhe linayo na enye indlela
eliza kuncedisana nabantu ngayo ukuze bawazi umthetho lo, ngoba badla
ngokuthetha ngee-road shows nayo yonke le nto. Iza kuphinda yenzeke kusini
na loo nto ukwenzela ukuba lo mthetho nale ndlela intsha abantu bayiqonde?
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Thank you, Chairperson. I would like to request the hon
Deputy Minister to provide me with a copy of his reply now because my
hearing is not perfect. Sometimes I find it difficult to hear. Here is
another question: Is there any way that his department could educate people
about this Act? They usually talk about road shows or things like that.
Will that happen again in order that people could learn about this Act and
the new system?]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H Davies): Chairperson, I
will certainly make a copy of the answers available to the hon member.
Well, yes, the National Credit Regulator, as I indicated, is planning a
series of information events, but I think that it could also be something
which could be undertaken by members through their constituency offices. I
am sure there will be information brochures, and I think those could be
passed on through constituency offices. I think this will be a major change
in our credit regime. I would also want to encourage the press to provide
information on the new rights and the new services that are available.

This is ongoing work which we will monitor and, as necessary, we will try
to improve communications if we see that messages are not getting through.
But what is for sure is that we are not going to be prepared to put up any
longer with a credit system which denies people access to credit on
spurious grounds; discriminates unfairly against people; and provides
reckless lending practices, unfair terms of payment and so on. So this is
going to be a major change and we look forward to this benefiting our
people in discernible and practical ways. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr A WATSON: Chair, I want to thank the Deputy Minister for giving us such
a comprehensive answer. Just before I pose my question, I would ask that
that particular answer, which is so concise, be distributed by the Table
staff to all the members for use in constituencies.

To get back to my follow-up question, it's not quite clear to me what
happens to past entries at the credit bureaus? You know, so many of our
people were coerced into debt that they simply could not afford, especially
in the furniture trade. I have personally been involved in a number of
cases where I have had to help people. However, inevitably, those bad debts
get added onto the credit bureau’s ratings. If I understood the Minister
correctly, those cut-off points also refer to the past; or is there a
different dispensation for past entries at the different credit bureaus in
regard to bad debt?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H Davies): Chairperson, I
will pass this answer for this question on to the Table staff and they can
distribute it to all members.

There are new rules which will apply when the Act comes into force on 1
June 2007 and which will provide for the amount of time for which
information of different kinds can be held. I did indicate that. So, you
can't have adverse credit information held forever, from now on.

But, in addition to that, there are certain categories of credit
information which have already been gathered, and which are already being
used by credit bureaus and will be expunged. I mentioned the categories -
basically any debt below R500 will be expunged totally.

Then there are other qualifications of categories up to R50 000. I think
what we need is a balancing act between writing off every single credit
bureau reference which has been requested in some quarters, the need for a
new credit system that will operate on the basis of credit granters who
make judgements of whether people are actually credit-worthy, and
provisions as they are in this Act which says that reckless lending
transactions can be nullified under certain circumstances, meaning then
that the credit granters have to be able to have requisite information.

But this kind of discriminatory practice, where people’s lives are affected
for decades afterwards because when they were young and poor they had an
adverse credit record needs to be dealt with. You see little signposts
saying you should pay somebody a packet of money and that they will get you
off somewhere through the backdoor. That kind of dispensation is going. We
want a clearer, more transparent and fairer system of credit bureau
operations. Thank you.

Mr S SHICEKA: House Chairperson, the issue is that many people were coerced
into ... They were not really coerced but were duped into entering into
credit agreements without, sometimes, their knowledge, given the fact that
our system of IDs is archaic in nature. You may also find, as you see in
marriages, that people get married to people that they do not know and have
never seen. You find that most of those people are the poor who cannot
afford a lawyer that can go and represent them. Now, what is the problem,
Minister, in having a once-off removal of all these people who are on
credit bureaus so that we can start on a clean slate? The intention is to
ensure that everybody is able to be catered for, including those that
entered into these things wrongly. That is what the formations of civil
society are requesting.

I know for certain that the communist party is leading that campaign. What
is the problem then in actually ensuring that that campaign is acceded to,
and, that our people, in the context of the new law, can start afresh?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H Davies): Chairperson, I
think that the dispensation that I mentioned is a partial move in acceding
to those demands and requests from civil society. It certainly recognises
that, as the hon members said, poor people were cajoled, if not coerced,
into entering into credit transactions and that no account was taken of
people’s ability to pay. They were just shoved into these things and then,
once they default, suddenly all kinds of extra charges come in and a small
debt becomes a big debt and so on. It is recognised that that is a reality,
and that the credit bureau practices of the past were problematic.

However, as I said before, there has had to be a trade-off because of the
new system. It has been an offence for some time for credit granters to
hold people’s cards and IDs and so on. I know it happened, but if it still
happens, it is an offence.

If we move away from those forms, we have to move towards an information-
based system so that credit granters are able to have basic information
about the ability of credit seekers to be able to service debts and so on.
So, it has had to strike a balance between those two.

The answer that has come up, up to now, has been the one of partial amnesty
for different categories. I mentioned them at the beginning: R500 or less –
complete write off; R5 000 – court judgements, as long as it is 18 months
old, and R50 000 if the amount was paid. So it is a partial move in that
direction. But it hasn’t, I know, gone as far as some organisations in
civil society would like it to. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes—

         (a)      with profound sadness, the sudden departure of a gallant
               son of Africa and President of the International Cricket
               Council (ICC),Mr Percival Henry Frederick Sonn,
               affectionately known as Percy, who died at the age of 57 on
               Sunday morning, 28 May 2007 in the Durbanville Medi-Clinic in
               Cape Town; and
         (b)      that Mr Sonn, who joins the generation of fallen spears of
               the nation that have travelled the path of the ominous
               struggle for the liberation of the people of South Africa,
               will be buried on Saturday at the Durbanville cemetery in
               Cape Town;

   (2)      further notes that Mr Sonn has a long, remarkable and prolific
         history in the development of sport in South Africa and in the
         international community, and fought against apartheid both as a
         cricketer and a civil rights lawyer with vigour and great courage;


   (3)      also notes that his ingrained belief in the prospects of our
         country and determination to ensure cricket unity in South Africa
         led to the formation of the United Cricket Board of South Africa
         (UCBSA) in 1991, after more than 100 years of racial division, and
         that he was the first African to fill the post of ICC President;
         and


   (4)      takes this opportunity to extend its profound sympathy and
         condolences to the Sonn family, especially his wife and children,
         and the sporting fraternity across the world, for their loss and
         wishes them strength during this time of difficulty.


         May his soul rest in peace.

                    ELECTRICITY REGULATION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, members of the NCOP, I
think it will be proper for me to first associate myself with all the
motions that the House unanimously supported, wishing all the families
strength during this difficult time.

I would like to present to you the Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill,
after having received comments and support from all nine provinces for this
Bill. At this stage, I would like to take this opportunity to thank members
of the select committee for the work done here and in the provincial
legislatures and for the unanimous support that the Bill enjoyed.

The Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill was first introduced as chapter
four of the Electricity Regulation Bill, which became law on 1 August 2006.
The purpose was to provide a regulatory framework that regulates the
electricity value chain encompassing generation, transmission, distribution
and trading. Due to constitutional consideration, Parliament advised that
the Bill must be split into two parts. Part one, which was the Electricity
Regulation Bill, was to cover all non-municipal aspects of electricity
regulation. Part two would cover what we are about today, which is what we
call the Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill. This is about electricity
regulation, taking into account the constitutional rights of municipalities
- what is referred to as section 76 aspects of the Bill.

Our focus is now on concluding the Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill or
the part that relates to the regulation of municipal reticulation services,
as provided for in section 155(7) of the Constitution.

The rationale and the intention of this Bill are as follows: to provide for
licensing of all reticulation service providers, including municipalities;
to provide a framework for setting of tariffs by municipalities, a step
that will go towards the rationalisation of the many tariffs that we have
and also help us not to have a situation where municipalities will willy-
nilly just decide to increase the tariffs because the situation is as such
that we are unable to regulate or control municipalities in doing that –
so, we are bringing that regulation to municipalities to ensure that we
rationalise the tariffs.

It is going to empower the Minister to prescribe regulations for
municipalities in relation to electricity reticulation services, including
monitoring, compliance and corrective action in the event of breach by
municipalities; and it will also make provision, regarding the relationship
between municipalities as service authorities, and service providers who
provide reticulation services on their behalf.

In the last quarter of 2006, the Bill was introduced in Parliament. You
know, Chairperson, I have a lot of time. So, I want to take up a lot of
this time that I have here. I don’t want to finish quickly. I want to
prolong my speech even if it is short so that at least I can prolong my
stay here in the Chamber. It’s been a long time since I have seen you. But,
given that I have Minister Skweyiya here, I’ll try and be faster.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You have five minutes left ...
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: No. I have 15 minutes. In the last
quarter of 2006, the Bill was introduced in Parliament. Public hearings
were then held before the parliamentary portfolio committee. The committee
adopted the Bill in November 2006 and it was subsequently referred to the
NCOP as a section 76 Bill.

The Bill, as already indicated, was considered by the nine provincial
legislatures for adoption during the first quarter of 2007. As I indicated,
the provinces unanimously supported the Bill, subject to certain
amendments. These amendments have been taken into account in the final
Bill, as presented here. The state law adviser has taken these amendments
into account in arriving at the final version of the Bill, including
ensuring compatibility with the Constitution.

The Bill tabled before you today incorporates all comments received from
stakeholders – and there are many stakeholders. I hope members will
continue to engage on this Bill, because sometimes the devil is in the
implementation. So, the process does not end here, for all of us. You need
to continue to monitor the implementation and we would really appreciate
feedback from members if anything goes amiss in the process of
implementation.

This completes the institutional legislative framework which will then
allow certain regulations to be implemented in improving the delivery of
reticulation services.  This Bill also ensures that Nersa plays an
unambiguous role in its quest to achieve better regulation outcomes in the
entire electricity value chain.

Once again, I would like to thank all the members of the NCOP and the
select committee for their invaluable contribution and support in the
processing and handling of this Bill. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members and comrades, in
our policy debate last year we raised the issue that all South Africans
must have access to all basic necessities, one of which is electricity. The
launch of RED 1 in July 2005 was a step towards that.

Indlela yokuchitha imali yeli sebe ibonakala kakuhle. Uya kubona ukuba
ayisasazwa kangako imali. Ezi zihlomelo ziphakanyiswayo ziza kwenza khaphu-
khaphu umthwalo woomasipala. Ngaba, Mphathiswa, inkqubo yeli sebe yokuba
kube kugqityiwe ukumiselwa kwee-RED ngoMatshi walo nyaka uzayo isemi kusini
na, kuba ukuba kunjani ezi ziphakamiso nezihlomelo ziya kukwazi ukwenzeka.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[This department has shown transparency in its expenditure. You can see
that no money has been wasted. These proposals that are raised will make it
easy for the municipalities. I hope the Minister will tell us how far they
are with their business plan, regarding the establishment of RED in March
next year. If that is in place these submissions and proposals will be
possible.]

One of the clauses in the Bill mentions that a municipality must follow the
Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, and must always refer to the
Electricity Act, so that municipalities such as the City of Cape Town do
not misuse it. I must mention ...

... njengomhlali walapha eKapa nozalelwe apha ... [ as a Capetonian and a
person who resides here ...]

... that the City of Cape Town wants to behave like an island. They have
been threatening to close down the first RED and continue to drive the DA’s
unholy policies.

This legislative development seeks to integrate the regulation of the
electricity distribution industry and do away with different tariffs.
Interestingly, we have approximately 2 000 tariffs in existence. Some are
called inner-city tariffs and others are called outer-city tariffs.
Unfortunately, our people are subjected to whatever tariffs the
municipalities deem appropriate.

This legislative development seeks to provide uniformity as it integrates
tariff-setting through the national framework of norms and standards. This
immensely benefits the poor and the poorest of our country.

The Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill serves as a propeller to the
realisation of an integrated electricity industry. This piece of
legislation effects changes that will go a long way towards protecting the
masses of our people from unequal tariffs.
Nditsho kuba kubantu besi Sixeko sethu umbane wenziwe wayinto efana nemana
evela kwi-DA, nto leyo engekhoyo. [I say this because people of this city
think that electricity is a free service provided by the DA, something
which is not true.]

It’s not true. Provision of electricity comes from the national government,
which is the only government that must implement policies that govern the
entire South Africa.

Consistent with the RDP’s pronouncement on electricity for all our people,
this Bill gives practical expression to our ANC-led government’s policy on
free basic electricity for the poorest of the poor of our people. This
indicates our consciousness and concern about the conditions that our
people are subjected to.

In our last committee meeting on this Bill ...

Uyabona, abantu abangathandiyo ukumamela, ngaba basoloko beneengqondo
ezizodwa ezintlanganisweni. [People who do not want to listen are those who
always have a negative attitude in meetings.]

In our last committee meeting on this Bill, provinces supported the Bill
and the necessary amendments from the provinces were taken into
consideration. I must also mention that we tried our best to make sure that
we were as much consultative at provincial level as we could. All
stakeholders were invited and they made submissions, not only from the
NCOP’s side, but also from the National Assembly’s side. I therefore urge
the House to support the Bill with its amendments. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Hon Ministers, hon Chairperson, colleagues, I’d like to
agree with hon Ntwanambi that electricity comes from the national
government, and that’s why we’ve had so many power outages lately.
[Laughter.]

Die belangrikste eienskap van hierdie wetsontwerp is om duidelikheid te gee
aan die regulatoriese rol van munisipaliteite met betrekking tot die
Voorgestelde Streekselektrisiteitsvoorsieners, REDS. Munisipaliteite sal
nie verplig word deur die wet om diensleweringsooreenkomste met die REDS
aan te gaan nie, maar sal die geleentheid hê om elektrisiteit te retikuleer
en te versprei.

’n Verdere belangrike punt om te vermeld is dat die administrasie van die
wetsontwerp die daarstelling van norme en standaarde en die bepaling van
sleutelleweringstandaarde vir die verspreiding en retikulasie van
elektrisiteit deur die NER - Nasionale Energiereguleerder - in konsultasie
met die Minister van Minerale en Energie gedoen sal word en nie deur die
Minister in konsultasie met die NER, soos wat voorheen die geval was nie.

Die uitvoerende gesag verantwoordelik vir die retikulasie en verspreiding
van elektrisiteit bly steeds gevestig in plaaslike regering met die
aanvullende vereiste dat daardie munisipaliteite wat die retikulasie of
verspreiding van elektrisiteit wil onderneem, sowel as daardie
munisipaliteite wat diensleweringsooreenkomste met ’n RED wil aangaan om
die retikulasie of verspreiding van elektrisiteit namens die RED te
onderneem deur die NER gelisensieer moet wees ten einde te verseker dat die
minimum standaarde in die lewering van elektrisiteit gehandhaaf sal word.
Die uitvoerende gesag vir die lewering van elektrisiteitsregulasie, soos
voorsien in bylae 4(b) en 5(b) van die Grondwet, is gevestig in plaaslike
regering.

Die lisensieering van diensverskaffers sal verseker dat die NER
eenvormigheid in die voorsiening van elektrisiteit deur nasionale norme en
standaarde daar sal kan stel. ’n Munisipaliteit het slegs nodig om aansoek
te doen vir ’n lisensie indien die munisipaliteit besluit om elektrisiteit
aan verbruikers te voorsien. Geen lisensie hoef vir enige ander dienste wat
die munisipaliteit verskaf, verkry te word nie.

Heffings wat deur munisipaliteite gehef word, word nie verbied deur hierdie
wet nie, alhoewel dit die bedoeling van die wet is dat munisipaliteite die
inkomste genereer uit die elektrisiteitsfunksie slegs vir retikulasie en
verspreiding van elektrisiteit moet gebruik. Dit word gedoen om te verseker
dat inkomste wat bedoel is vir die onderhoud en vervanging van verouderende
elektrisiteitsinfrastruktuur nie vir ander dienste en doeleindes gebruik
word nie.

In die lig van die bovermelde ondersteun die DA die wetsontwerp. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The most important characteristic of this Bill is to clarify the
regulatory role of municipalities with regard to the proposed Regional
Electricity Distributors, REDs. Municipalities will not be obliged by the
Act to enter into service delivery contracts with the REDS, but will have
the opportunity to reticulate and distribute electricity.

A further important point to mention is that the administration of the
Bill, the establishment of norms and standards and determining key delivery
standards for the distribution and reticulation of electricity by the
National Energy Regulator, the NER, will be done in consultation with the
Minister of Minerals and Energy, and not by the Minister in consultation
with the NER, as was the case before.

The executive authority responsible for the reticulation and distribution
of energy still remains with local governments, with the additional
requirement that those municipalities that want to undertake the
reticulation or distribution of electricity, as well as those
municipalities that want to enter into service delivery agreements with a
RED to undertake the reticulation or distribution of electricity on behalf
of the RED, must be licensed by the NER to ensure that the minimum
standards in the delivery of electricity will be maintained. The executive
authority for the delivery of electricity reticulation, as provided in
Schedules 4(b) and 5(b) of the Constitution, rests with the local
government.

The licensing of service providers will ensure that the NER will be able to
establish uniformity in electricity delivery by applying national norms and
standards. Municipalities only need to apply for a licence if the
municipality decides to provide electricity to consumers. No licence needs
to be acquired for any other services that the municipality provides.

Levies imposed by municipalities are not prohibited by this Act, although
the object of the Act is that municipalities that generate income from the
electricity function use it only for reticulation and distribution of
electricity. This is being done to ensure that income intended for the
maintenance and replacement of electricity infrastructure that is becoming
aging is not used for other services and purposes.

In light of the above the DA supports the Bill. [Applause.]]

Mrs E S MABE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, ladies and
gentlemen, the basic RDP document, in one of its six pillars, requires
government to provide basic services to all South Africans across the
length and breadth of our country, in urban and rural areas, formal and
informal settlements.

One of the key basic services is electricity. Electricity is an instrument
that brings light, chases away darkness and brings warmth and hope.
Electricity also makes it easier for us to prepare our meals. In its
economic downstream, it creates jobs through electrical appliances. In
order to access essentials like media through our televisions and our
radios, we also need the supply of electricity.

Electricity contributes in the improvement of the quality of life of any
nation. It improves communication and linkages with other nations of the
world in a global village. Therefore, the accessibility and affordability
of electricity is a matter of must. The development of uniform tariffs lays
the basis for the realisation of the aforementioned objective.
This Bill also lays the foundation for the implementation of regional
electricity distributors, REDs, and clarifies the roles and
responsibilities of both REDs and municipalities. This piece of legislation
will be creating conditions that are conducive for the implementation of
the ANC’s policy of providing free basic electricity to the poorest of the
poor within the ranks of our people.

South Africa has a developed economy, in comparison to other 52 nations of
Africa and therefore has a developed infrastructure. Our generation
capacity and distribution networks are unparalleled in the continent.
Therefore, there is no reason that we can’t meet the ANC’s manifesto target
of 2010, in particular, and the Millennium Development Goals in general.
The Free State has voted in favour of this Bill and I thank you.
[Applause.]

Ms A N T MCHUNU: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon chairperson of the
select committee and all hon members, the insertion of chapter 4 in Act 4
of 2006 is accepted and approved by the IFP. The energy that provides
electricity acts as fuel and, as such, it has to be regulated.

Kufuneka singadlali ngomlilo. [We must not play with fire.]

Amendments that have been agreed on recognise the existence of those who
have licences and who will be taken on board and given in-service training.
Others who are accredited to participate in electricity reticulation will
need to be registered. In order to protect the end-users of electricity, it
is good that service providers will work together with the electricity
regulator.

It is a pity that electricity reticulation has overtaken proper village
designs in rural areas. Where villages have proper roads, electricity poles
would have had to follow those roads. It is also a pity that good
developmental programmes were packaged together with dirty programmes that
made black areas appear as if occupied by lesser humans, in the days of
grand apartheid.

However, efforts were made to correct the situation through research, as
shown in McCrystal White Paper and by the findings of the Buthelezi
Commission. So, we need to consult those reports in order to determine how
we can deal with those hilly and mountainous areas.

Electricity is going to speed up economic development, especially in rural
areas. Let us visit the above-mentioned reports as well to see what was
recommended about the vast hilly areas covering the Eastern Cape, the
jugged topography of KwaZulu, from Harding right up to Hlabisa and Ubombo
mountains. I mention these areas because they boggle the mind when one
thinks about them. So, municipalities that cover these rugged mountainous
and hilly areas, with homesteads scattered all over, have to be assisted
with budgeting appropriately, considering these geographical disabilities.

Further education and training colleges have to develop and train young
electricians who are going to assist the people who are using electricity
on the ground. Different types of energy, perhaps, will also be taken into
consideration by various communities. Some will generate their electricity
from cow dung and others from the solar system and other things.

The IFP supports the amendments and appreciates the work that is done.

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Hon Chair, Ministers in the House today and my colleagues,
let us admit that electricity is key and crucial for economic growth and
social development. Around the world there is demand for technologically-
driven production, and that can only be achieved when energy is available.
Decent and modern living described by our ruling party, the ANC, as a
better life for all, places electricity provision at the centre of a
sustainable and developing economy.

Electricity is also an important source of revenue for most of our
municipalities that distribute electricity. Therefore, the restructuring of
the electricity industry is necessary, particularly at local government
sphere, because it practically gives expression to the transformation of
society from the past colonial legacy to the current democratic free
society.

Again, why the Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill? Allow me to remind
this august House that there is the National Energy Act of 2004 that
provides for the establishment of a single regulator to regulate
electricity, piped gas and petroleum pipeline industries, whereas the
Electricity Bill that was enacted in 1987 provided for the regulation of
electricity generation, transmission and distribution, and increases to
electricity tariffs have to be approved by the regulator.

Although the need for a regulator is supported, the existing electricity
legislation did not take sufficient account of some key issues, including
the constitutional mandate of local government, in respect of electricity
reticulation services. Hence, this Electricity Regulation Bill is necessary
to close the gap.

Again we should remind our Minister and the department about principles
underpinning any electricity restructuring process, that is, the
restructuring must be in accordance with the Constitution, taking into
account that the responsibility for electricity reticulation is a municipal
function.

The financial health of municipalities currently performing the electricity
function must not be adversely affected. Aggregate personnel costs must not
increase in a way that undermines the objectives of one Public Service.

In conclusion, the ANC is the only political party that has a contract with
the citizens of this country, and it uses a gender lens whenever it
prepares its budgets. I thank you and the ANC is happy about this amending
Bill. [Applause.]

Mr N D HENDRICKSE: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members, this Bill seeks
to amend the Electricity Regulation Act of 2006, so as to make certain
textual corrections, in order to insert a new chapter that deals with
electricity reticulation by municipalities. In fact, this Bill gives the
Minister powers to make regulations and provide for matters connected
therewith.

The use of safe electricity is a major issue in our public safety. In the
past few years, a significant number of people were killed in this country
as a result of accidents attributed to electricity. The fact that
electricity is such a potentially hazardous resource that is widely used as
a source of energy makes it vitally important to ensure that members of the
public are not put at risk through everyday use.

The UIF notes that many small municipalities cannot maintain their
infrastructure nor prevent outages, not because of the fault of anybody
else but because of the infrastructure itself. The Bill provides for the
National Energy Regulator to be the custodian and enforcer of the national
electricity framework. We sincerely hope the amendment will help to reduce
the prices and tariffs of electricity. We welcome the regulation on
tariffs, because many municipalities have been taking people for a ride.

The Minister must ensure that the regulator enforces performance and
compliance, and see to it that appropriate action is taken against those
who do not comply with the rules and regulations. The regulator must
mediate in all disputes between generators, transmitters, distributors and
customers. Our concern is the cost of the new power stations and we
sincerely hope that this will not be passed on to the end-users but that it
will come from the fiscus.

The most important feature of the Bill is that it provides regulatory
clarity in respect of the role of municipalities, in conjunction with the
envisaged REDs.

The need for public education about energy remains a challenge in our
provinces. The government should put in place an education strategy on
energy efficiency, cleaner energy, and dangers of paraffin and coal in
households. This must be addressed as a matter of urgency.

The UIF supports the Bill. I thank you.

Ms B L MATLHOAHELA: Chairperson, hon Ministers, colleagues, the ID has
followed this Bill with quaint interest. In the year 2000, whilst I was a
police reservist, serving my country voluntarily, I was told by a police
inspector that in the next five to six years we were going to have a
shortage of electricity. I forgot about it, but when it happened I
remembered. Now, how did it happen that our rulers at that point did not
foresee it? However, we have passed there now and we have to concentrate on
the present, which is also a gift and is so important.

The ID’s concern is the municipalities. We believe that thorough training
for municipalities is essential, in order to make this Bill successful in
the future. It is an expensive process and risk factors should not be a
component. The thrust of this Bill is that maximum support on all levels of
municipalities, from the beginning, should be the highest priority.

As we take note of the powers and duties of municipalities in relation to
reticulation and area of jurisdiction, finance should be ascertained,
especially regarding those close to bankruptcy and bankrupt municipalities.


Consideration should be granted to those municipalities who became bankrupt
due to unemployed clients in their communities who cannot pay for services.
Non-compliance with this Act can have severe implications to those who do
not comply, owing to negligence. We trust that that will be the outcome. I
thank you, Chairperson.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Hon Chairperson, I think I must take
the opportunity to express appreciation to the chairperson of the select
committee, Ms Ntwanambi, for the leadership that has taken us thus far. I
want to say that all of you are pre-empting my Budget Vote speech. You are
really pushing for me to make announcements on a number of issues. I refuse
to do that, because my speech is embargoed until tomorrow. [Laughter.] I
will try and respond to some of those matters.

On the issue that the chairperson raised, about the date of the regional
electricity distributor, we are still saying that it will be 2008. But, I
must say that it is a very complex and very tedious process. We are trying
to make sure that nobody is left out.

We are consulting widely. As we speak, we are in the provinces. We are
targeting the provincial communication forums, PCFs, in the provinces,
which bring together the municipalities as well as the provinces. So, we
are in the process of consulting. I think this is the third round of
consultations that we are doing, because of the complexity of the matter
that we are dealing with.

Of course, you will appreciate that a number of things that are being
raised by municipalities are being taken very seriously by us, especially
the issue of revenue sharing, which has been used as a tool against this
process. Now, again, I have to go into my speech.

Ayikho loo nto, oomasipala abazi kuxuthwa mali. [There is no such no money
will be seized from the municipalities.]

There is nothing like that. We have an arrangement where municipalities
will enter into agreements between themselves and the REDs that we are
going to establish. Those agreements will ensure that revenue is shared. We
actually envisage better revenue generation for municipalities when the
REDs are there. So, the process of the REDs is on course, and nothing is
going to change our direction on that course. We are on course regarding
that one.

Siza kuqhuba siluhlengahlengisa olu shishino lobonelelo ngombane. Kunjalo
nje, sifuna ukuhlala sijolise kweza-RED zintandathu kuphela. [We will
continue to provide electricity and we will always focus on the six REDs.]

Outages are not unique to South Africa; they happen in America as well.
Unfortunately, this is a consequence of the positive things happening in
our country. Firstly, the fact that we have expanded the services to the
poorest communities has meant that we have stretched our supply, and there
is more demand than the supply that we would have had if we had restricted
these services to the minority that were enjoying it at the time. We are
now saying that everybody must enjoy electricity, and in the process of
expanding, our supply is affected.

I think we must underscore that one other thing that is a contributing
factor is the fast growth in our economy and, as we all appreciate, energy
is quite central in any industrialised economy. You need energy for growth
in the economy. So, we have seen growth, which we are actually
underestimating. We are underestimating the growth that we are experiencing
in South Africa. We are very conservative. Some have been saying it is 5%;
some have been saying 6%; and some are even saying it’s 9%. That also
causes problems, with regard to the energy supply.

Hon Mchunu, of course, we have an energy mix policy which would help us to
deliver energy in the rural areas where the topography is not so good. We
are looking at the solar system; we are looking at wind farms and all of
those forms of energy that will ensure that we continue to expand the
service to all our people. The results that are coming up from the pilot
that we are doing on solar energy are that people are not so happy with the
solar energy system. They are saying that the solar energy system is not of
a good quality, but we will be looking at that.

Regarding the infrastructure, we’ve a huge amount that has been given to
Eskom. Eskom has been given an amount which, I think, is to the tune of
R100 million for rolling out the infrastructure. The rural areas will be
benefiting from that.

On the issue of restructuring in accordance with the Constitution, again,
we had indicated that ...

... lo Mthetho usayilwayo siwusile kubacebisi bezomthetho bakarhulumente
ukuze ujongwe ukuba uyahambelana na noMgaqo-siseko. [... this Bill has been
taken to the state law advisers to ensure that it is compatible with the
Constitution.]

We are quite happy that the state law advisers gave us the go-ahead,
because they said that it is compatible with the Constitution. So, we don’t
envisage any problem in as far as that is concerned. Even with regard to
the REDs, we are looking at that situation.

Lo mba uyaphakanyiswa, wokuba ... [The issue has been raised that ...]

... the REDs must be compatible with the Constitution. We are working very
hard to ensure that that happens. Again, I have to stop here. I am very
constrained, because most of the issues are issues that are in my speech.
You will see that I am not giving you enough, as I should, but I thought I
should give you a taste.

Thank you very much for your inputs. We have noted some of the issues that
were raised concerning support to municipalities. In the event that
municipalities do not have money, I think that will be considered in the
equitable share. We know which municipalities are the poorest, and that is
accommodated in the equitable share that they get from the Division of
Revenue Bill. That would then be taken care of.

Of course, there is a relationship between departments and municipalities,
where we always look at the capacity and how we can help capacitate
municipalities that otherwise would have limited capacity. So, the support
to municipalities would always be there. Thank you very much, Chairperson,
and thank you all for the support. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, Minister. We shall now proceed to
the voting on the question. I shall do so in alphabetic order per province.
Delegation heads, please indicate to the Chair whether you vote in favour,

                          CHILDREN’S AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, hon members, I thank you
for the opportunity to address the NCOP on the occasion of the debate on
the Children's Amendment Bill. Within government, we have launched the
Child Protection Week on a national and provincial level and it is indeed a
timely coincidence to address the NCOP on this Bill.

We are at a critical milestone in our efforts to put comprehensive
legislation in place that would adequately protect the rights of children
in South Africa, as enshrined in the Bill of Rights of our Constitution.

The Children's Amendment Bill is intended to be an integral part of the
Children's Act, Act 38 of 2005, which was signed and assented to by the
President on 8 June 2006. The Children's Act, in its formation, was part of
the consolidated Bill aimed at dealing with the full spectrum of protection
of children in both national and provincial spheres of government, and was
to be dealt with in terms of section 76 of the Constitution, that is within
schedule 4 - functional areas of concurrent national and provincial
legislative competence.

However, the consolidated Bill was found by Parliament in 2003 to be a
mixed Bill, which included elements to be handled in terms of both section
75, functional area of national legislative competence, and section 76 of
the Constitution.

Due to its mixed character, the consolidated Bill was split and provisions,
which applied to the provincial government, were removed. The Children's
Act, as assented to by the President, contains matters which have been
dealt with in terms of section 75 of the Constitution. Those provisions,
which were removed from the consolidated Bill, form the Children's
Amendment Bill, which will amend the Children's Act.

The department introduced the Children's Amendment Bill, a section 76 Bill,
in the National Council of Provinces on 25 July 2006. The Children's
Amendment Bill makes provision for the protection of children, partial
care, early childhood development, prevention and early intervention
services, alternative care, foster care, child and youth care centres, as
well as drop-in centres.

The Children's Amendment Bill gives effect to the protection of children in
the following manner: It makes provision for partial care, known as place
of care in the existing Child Care Act of 1983, which refers to when a
person with or without reward, takes care of more than six children on
behalf of their parents or care-givers for a temporary period, by
agreement.

Partial care is a facility in which programmes, for example early childhood
development services, should be rendered. These facilities must be
registered with the provincial departments of social development.

The amending Bill further makes provision for the registration and
monitoring of ECD programmes separate from partial care centres. The
implication is that if an ECD programme is offered at a partial care
facility, there will be a requirement for it to register both as a partial
care and as an ECD programme.

The separation of partial care facility and the ECD programme is in
recognition of the fact that partial care facilities can be used for
various programmes other than ECD. There is also recognition for the needs
of children with disabilities in both partial care and the ECD programme,
and for the MECs to ensure a good spread of both partial care and ECD
programmes in each province of this country.

The Bill introduces better reporting mechanisms for child abuse, neglect
and exploitation of children, by mandating a variety of professionals, for
example, social workers, teachers, medical practitioners, psychologists and
many others to, on suspicion, report a child who has been sexually abused,
neglected or abused if it is in the best interest of the child concerned.

Other persons who believe that a child is in need of care and protection
because of abuse, sexual abuse or deliberate neglect may report that belief
to a social worker, the police or a child protection organisation.

Chairperson, as we are aware, most statutory social services for children
and their families are delivered by welfare organisations referred to as
designated child protection organisations in this Bill.

The director-general or provincial head of social development, on written
application, may designate any appropriate organisation that complies with
the prescribed criteria as a child protection organisation to perform in
the relevant province all or any specific designated child protection
services.

The amending Bill addresses the plight of child-headed households, and
makes provision for the provincial head of social development to recognise
a household as a child-headed household, if the parent or care-giver of the
household is terminally ill or has died; no adult family member is
available to provide care for the children in the household; a child has
assumed the role of caregiver in respect of a child in the household; a
child over the age of 15 years has assumed the role of caregiver in respect
of the children in the household; and if the children in the household have
been investigated by a social worker as contemplated in section 150(2).
Such a child-headed household must function under the general supervision
of an adult designated by a children's court, an organisation of state or
an NGO determined by the provincial head of social development.

Decisions concerning the child-headed households and the children may not
be taken without consulting the child at the head of the household and the
other children. Furthermore, no person may take or send a child out of the
Republic without consent from persons holding relevant parental rights and
responsibilities in respect of that child or without consent from a court.

The Children's Amendment Bill further provides for discipline of children.
It states that no child may be subjected to corporal punishment or be
punished in a cruel or degrading way and the following points are included:
the child's right to physical integrity as conferred in the Constitution
must be respected - izingane azishaywa [children should not be beaten]; the
common law defence of reasonable chastisement available to persons in any
court proceeding is hereby abolished; no person may administer corporal
punishment to a child at any child and youth care centre, partial care
facility or drop-in centre; the department must take all reasonable steps
to ensure that education and awareness-raising programmes are implemented
across the country, and that programmes promoting appropriate discipline at
home and at school are available across the country.

The Children's amending Bill attempts to promote the safety of
entertainment premises to children. Adequate stairs, escalators, lifts or
other mechanical means must be provided. A person providing entertainment
must determine the number of children and the number of adult attendants,
control the movement of people, take all reasonable precautions for the
safety of children, and not sell alcohol or tobacco products to children.

The amending Bill supports the prohibition of the employment of children
under the age of 15 years. The importance of prevention and early
intervention services are recognised in the amending Bill as it provides
for court-ordered early intervention services. This is the first time that
prevention and early intervention services are legislated for, and that
norms and standards for such programmes are determined.

The amending Bill also provides for alternative care, such as foster care,
and child and youth care centres. Foster care includes placement of a child
in the care of a person who is not a parent or a guardian of a child by
court order. A new provision in this chapter is the placement of a child
with a family member, and, where appropriate, for more than two years or
until the child reaches the age of 18 years. This provision takes
cognisance of a large number of orphans who are placed in stable
environments with family member or members and therefore require a minimum
or no supervision from a social worker.

More than six children may be placed in foster care in terms of a cluster
foster care scheme, which provides for the children to be grouped in houses
which accommodate not more than six children per house or such other number
of children per house as the court may have determined. For the first time,
child and youth care centres include traditional shelters, which render
service to children living, working or begging in the streets. Child and
youth care centres must, as a condition for registration, offer therapeutic
programmes which may include reception, care and development; temporary
safe care of children pending their placement; protection from abuse and
neglect; care and protection of trafficked or commercially sexually
exploited children; observing and assessing children; providing counselling
and other treatment; and, lastly, assisting children to reintegrate with
their families and communities.
Child and youth care centres must have management boards and no person who
is not suitable to work with children may be appointed or continue to serve
at a child and youth care centre. The Bill, lastly, provides for drop-in
centres managed for the purpose of providing services, excluding overnight
accommodation, to children and including children living, working or
begging in the streets. Drop-in centres must provide outreach programmes as
well as prevention and intervention programmes.

The Children’s Act is progressive and promotes new approaches to
implemented changes that must replace old practices. Therefore new skills
are required to implement this Act successfully. Existing service
providers, especially child protection organisations, should be
strengthened to assist in addressing the challenges of implementing the
Children’s Act and this amending Bill. With the shortage of social workers,
it is of the utmost importance that other professionals are allowed to
assist social workers in the execution of their task to protect children in
the country. Hence the Bill provides that relevantly capacitated social
service professionals be included in welfare service delivery to children,
especially in instances where professional social work service is not
essential.

The department has a recruitment and retention strategy to address the
shortage of social workers. I would like to appeal to young people to make
use of the opportunity of available bursaries and learnerships for training
in social work and social auxiliary work. Resources required to implement
the Act will be provided in terms of an approach that recognise the
existence of competing social and economic needs; and that recognises that
the organs of state in the national, provincial and, where applicable,
local spheres of government, will take reasonable measures within the
available resources to prioritise the realisation of the objectives of this
Act. The Bill, together with the Children’s Act, has been fully quoted to
inform resource allocations at various levels.

This Bill is one of the foundation Acts of Parliament to protect our
children and to ensure actions in the best interest of families and
children. Its finalisation is therefore critical. My department is
developing regulations and implementation plans to offset any delays that
might be encountered in implementing this Act.

Programmes have also been prepared, subject to presidential approval, to
activate those provisions in the Children’s Act of 2005, which do not
require regulations such as lowering the age of majority of the child to 18
years.

I wish to thank all members of the Select Committee on Social Services and
the provincial legislatures for their assistance in finalising the
Children’s Amendment Bill. I would also like to thank the officials of the
SA Law Reform Commission and the state law advisers who are assisting with
the drafting of the amending Bill, as well as the officials of the
Department of Social Development and other departments who are on the
Children’s Act steering committee for their hard work and persistence on
this Bill.

Thank you, Madam Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms J M MASILO: Hon House Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members and invited
guests, it gives me great pleasure to speak on the Children’s Amendment
Bill during the Children’s Awareness Week.

The lives of children are protected by various pieces of legislation and
institutional conventions. Apart from section 28 of the Constitution, which
deals with the rights of children, the statutes pertaining to children
currently on the Statute Book are as follows: Age of Majority Act, Act 57
of 1972; Child Care Act, Act 74 of 1983; Guardianship Act, Act 192 of 1993;
Children’s Status Act, Act 82 of 1987; The Hague Convention on the Civil
Aspects of International Child Abduction Act, Act 72 of 1996; and the
Natural Fathers of Children Born Out of Wedlock Act, Act 86 of 1997.

This amending Bill contains parts of the envisaged Children’s Act. The Bill
that was initially submitted to Parliament - the consolidated Bill - dealt
with the full spectrum of children in both the national and provincial
spheres of government, as it was to fall, in terms of section 76 of the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996, under the
functional area of concurrent national and provincial legislative
competence. However, it was found to be a mixed Bill, including elements to
be dealt with in terms of the functional areas of legislative competence of
both section 75 and section 76 of the Constitution.

The Parliament of South Africa passed the consolidated Bill that will apply
to the national government in 2005, as the
Children’s Act, Act 38 of 2005. The provisions of the consolidated Bill
that will apply to the provincial government are contained in the current
amending Bill as an amendment to the Children’s Act of 2005. This amending
Bill will be dealt with in terms of section 76 of the Constitution and will
complete the Children’s Act by inserting the provisions that deal with
welfare services delivered by the provinces.

However, over the past few years it became clear that existing legislation
was not keeping up with the realities of current social problems faced by
children, and no longer protected children adequately. In addition thereto,
the Republic of South Africa has acceded to various international
conventions such as the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the
Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. The
principle had to be incorporated into local legislation.

The amending Bill expands on the Children’s Act by inserting the following:
Chapter 5 deals with the partial care and approval of registration of
partial care facilities; chapter 6 regulates the approval and registration
of early childhood development, ECD, programmes, provided by an individual
other than the child’s parent or caregiver on a regular basis to children
up to the school-going age; chapter 8 deals with the prevention and early
intervention services, and it provides for facilities where children
identified as being vulnerable or at risk can be accommodated, as a form of
alternative care.

Chapter 11 provides for alternative care for children. Chapter 12 and 13
further expand on alternative care by respectively regulating arrangements
for foster care and child and youth centres. Chapter 13 determines that
child and youth care centres must comply with certain requirements, namely
they must be registered, offer certain programmes to children in the care
of these centres, must have a management system, and a quality assurance
process must be carried out in respect of the centre.

Chapter 14 regulates the establishment of the centre and norms and
standards for drop-in centres. It provides that the inspection of records
of the drop-in centres should be undertaken. The provincial head of the
department must maintain a record of all available drop-in centres in his
or her area.

The heads of social development in the provinces must also conduct regular
inspection of drop-in centres to enforce the provisions of this Bill.
Provincial strategies must include strategies of drop-in centres.
Strategies should include the following measures: facilitate the
establishment of sufficient drop-in centres in the provinces; prioritise
those types of drop-in centres most urgently required; and, facilitate the
identification and provision of suitable resources.

If abuse resulting in the death or serious injury of a child occurs in a
drop-in centre, it must be immediately reported by a person in charge of
the drop-in centre to the provincial head of social development and the
cause of the injury or abuse of the child should be investigated.

If the child dies while in partial care or following an occurrence in the
drop-in centre, the person operating the centre must immediately report the
death to the police official and the head of the department of social
development in the province. The police official must investigate the
circumstances of the death of the child.

The processes of consultation by the select committee on this Bill were as
follows: From 12 to 13 October 2006 the NCOP select committee attended and
participated in a workshop organised by the national Department of Social
Development and the National Treasury, where we were briefed on the context
of the Bill and the costing. The workshop was held in Kopanong Conference
Centre in Gauteng.
On 17 October 2006 the Department of Social Development briefed the Select
Committee on Social Services on the Bill. On 22 May 2007 the Select
Committee on Social Services considered the mandates from
six provinces. It is of great concern that three provinces did not submit
their mandates. These are North West - my province, Limpopo and Mpumalanga,
even though the Bill had been with the provinces since March 2007.

In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the
following senior managers from the department, who tirelessly worked on
this Bill, who worked with the select committee in organising a series of
workshops, including a workshop held in Simon’s Town in Cape Town: Deputy
Director-General Ms Nhlapo; Dr Mabetoa – the chief director who is in
charge of the Children’s Bill; Ms Ngcobo-Mbere, who is the director of the
children’s programme; Dr Kganyago, chief director of the HIV-Aids
Programme; the support staff of the various departments of government, in
particular, Ms Matlhogonolo and Mr Pierre du Preez, and legal advisers of
the Department of Social Development.

Thank you very much for the support you gave the select committee. I think
this Bill is the longest and most complicated Bill the select committee has
ever worked on. Well done to you members of the Select Committee on Social
Services for your commitment and contributions in working even after hours
to finalise this amending Bill. The Select Committee on Social Services
supports the Children’s Amendment Bill, Bill 19 of 2006. Thank you.

Nk N F MAZIBUKO: Sihlalo nani malungu, ngesiNgisi bathi: It takes a village
to grow a child. Uma ngiguqulela lokhu esintwini, kuthiwa ingane
ngeyomphakathi wonke. Yingakho namuhla sihlangene lapha kule Ndlu
yoMkhandlu Wezifundazwe Kazwelonke sibonisana ngalo mthetho onhloso yawo
ukuvikela amalungelo ezingane kanye nokubhekela impatho yazo. Nathi sibamba
iqhaza ekukhuliseni zona lezi zingane, singamalungu.

Izolo bekuyisiqalo sesonto okuhloswe ngalo ukuthi kugxilwe ekuvikeleni
izingane, phecelezi i-Child Protection Week. Inyanga kaJuni nayo iyinyanga
ebhekene nabasha kanye nezingane. NgesiNgisi, ingqikithi ithi, “Caring
communities care for their children”. Inhloso ngukugubha leli sonto
ngokuqinisa noma ukuthatha izinyathelo ezinqala zokuqinisekisa ukuthi
amalungelo ezingane athathelwa phezulu, ngoba lezi zingane zingabaholi
bakusasa.

Kuyingqophamlando ukuthi sigunyaze lo mthetho obizwa ngokuthi i-Children’s
Amendment Bill, kulo leli sonto elibhekene namalungelo ezingane.
Singamalungu eNdlu yoMkhandlu, kubalulekile ukuthi uma senza umsebenzi
wethu ezakhiweni zemiphakathi esivotele siqaphele izimpawu ezizobonakalisa
ukuthi umthetho uyahlonishwa. Ngithemba ukuthi sonke siyalithola leli
phephabhuku elivela esikhungweni esibhekela inhlalakahle yezingane, i-
Children’s Institute, elibhalwe yiNyuvesi yaseKapa, lapho khona izingane
zikhuluma ngaphansi kweqembu elizibiza ngokuthi iDinkwakwetla.

Uma ngilifunda leli phephabhuku, ngifunda ngezindaba ezibuhlungu nezimo
ezimbi izingane eziphila ngaphansi kwazo. Ngizocaphuna okunye okushiwo
ngezinye izingane, ngokwezifundazwe. Esifundazweni saKwaZulu-Natali,
izingane ziye zaphawula ukuthi iningi lazo liyizintandane futhi ezinye
zikhulisa izingane zasemakubo; ngamanye amazwi zingobaba kanye nomama
emakubo. Ezinye zikhulume ngempatho eziyithola kubazali nezihlobo, egcina
ibangele ukuthi zibaleke emakhaya ziye kohlala emigwaqweni. Ezinye izingane
eLimpopo zona ziveze ukuthi ziyanukubezwa ngokocansi, kanti ezinye
ziyekelelwe, azinakiwe abazali bazo, futhi zibhukluzwa ngabazali kanye
nothisha, ziphinde zihlukunyezwe emoyeni.

Malungu, ayikho into ebuhlungu njengokuthi ungumzali uzele ingane bese
uyithatha uyoyibeka emzileni wesitimela. Ngamanye amazwe usuke ufuna
inyathelwe yisitimela. Usuke uyisaphi emhlabeni uma ngabe ungayifuni?
Abanye abazali bayazizala lezi zingane bajike bazithathe bazilahle
emaklabishini, emigqonyeni kadoti. Labo abanezindlu zangasese eziyimigodi
bazilahla lapho. Ake umuntu acabange lowo mfanekiso yena ngokwakhe uma
uphuma endlini encane, eqeda ukwenza inombolo yesibili. Akabheki nasemuva
ngoba usuke azi ukuthi kuyesabeka. Kepha abanye abazali abangenalo uzwelo
balahla izingane zabo lapho.

Lezi zingane ezilahlwayo zikhula zingalwazi uthando lomzali, azenzelwa
namasiko, futhi zisuke zingazi nokuthi zizalwa kwabani nokuthi bangobani
nabazali bazo. Bonke labo abenza izinto ezihlasimulisa umzimba ezinganeni
sithi kubo ba ... uTapsi, inja encane. Ingalo yomthetho yinde, izobathola.
Sihlalo, kukhona igama engingalishongo ngoba bazothi alihambisani nenqubo
yasePhalamende.

Abanye bashiya izingane ezikoleni kanye nasezinkulisa, bangazilandi
ngezikhathi zantambama, zigcine zilele lapho. Kusho ukuthini uma umzali
elele embhedeni wakhe engazi ukuthi ngane yakhe ikuphi? NgesiSuthu bathi:
Ba hlabisa dihlong. [Benza amahlazo]. Omunye ubaba wabulala ingane yakhe
maqede wayimbela khona egcekeni. Emuva kwalokho wakha umjondolo phezu kwalo
lelo thuna lengane. Yadlula iminyaka eyi-16 behamba phezu kwayo ingane,
yena nonkosikazi wakhe. Babedla, bephuza, belala, bevuka yonke le minyaka
behamba phezu kwengane. Yihlazo-ke lelo.

Ngalo mthetho, sithembisa izingane zaseNingizimu Afrika yonkana, nalezo
ezinganakiwe, ukuthi, maqondana nakho konke ezikushilo nobuhlungu
ezibuzwayo, uma lo mthetho ususayinwe uMongameli wesizwe, ngeke zisaphinde
zihlukunyezwe. Ingalo yomthetho izoqina, kujeziswe labo abangaziphathi
kahle izingane.

Abaphethe izindawo ezigcina izingane kufuneka baphucule lezo zindawo,
nempatho ibe yinhle. Abakhulisela uhulumeni izingane, phecelezi foster
care, nabo mabaziqaphele kahle lezi zingane zikahulumeni, bazinike uthando
nemfudumalo ngoba uhulumeni ukhipha imali ukuze zondliwe, zifundiswe.
Akufuneki benze into eyenziwa omunye umame owathatha izingane wazivalela
endlini yezinja, yena wahamba waya kophuza utshwala ngayo yona le mali
kahulumeni. Umthetho usuvumela izindawo lapho kunakekelwa khona intsha,
lokhu okuthiwa ama-youth and child care centres. Sezizokwanda emadolobheni
onke.

Uma ngiphetha, ngithi siyabonga kuNgqongqoshe ngokuthi wenze lo mthetho
ukuze kuthuthukiswe izimpilo zezingane. Sithi, singamalungu: Phambili
ngamalungelo ezingane! Ngiyabonga. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu
speech follows.)

[Ms N F MAZIBUKO: Chairperson and hon members, in English they say: It
takes a village to raise a child. This, in simple language, means that the
child belongs to the whole community. That is why we are gathered here
today in this House of the National Council of Provinces to discuss the
Bill that aims to protect the children’s rights and look at their
wellbeing. We, as members, also play a role in raising these children.

Yesterday was the start of the Child Protection Week. The month of June is
also dedicated to the youth and the children. In English, the theme is,
“Caring communities care for their children”. The main aim for observing
this week is to ensure that children’s rights are prioritised, because
these very children are tomorrow’s leaders.
It is history that in a week that is dedicated to highlight the children’s
rights, we are discussing such an important legislation, the Children’s
Amendment Bill. As members of the NCOP, it is important that when we are in
our constituencies doing constituency work, we become vigilant to see
whether the law is respected. I just hope that we all received the bulletin
that was distributed by the Children’s Institute, which is written by the
University of Cape Town, where children speak under the organisation called
Dikwankwetla.

When reading this bulletin, I read about painful stories and bad conditions
under which these children live. I will tell you what the children from the
different provinces say. In KwaZulu-Natal children say most of them are
orphans and others are heading the households; in other words they assume
the responsibilities of mothers and fathers to their siblings. Others have
spoken about the ill-treatment they get from their parents and relatives,
which eventually force them to run away from home and stay on the streets.
Other children from Limpopo disclosed that they are sexually assaulted, and
others are neglected, their parents do not care for them, and they are both
emotionally and physically abused by their parents and teachers.

Members, there is nothing more aggravating than a parent who takes her baby
to a train, with the intention of letting the train run over that little
child. Why do parents bring children into the world if they do not want
them? Other parents give birth to these children and throw them in the
gardens and in rubbish bins. Those who use pit toilets throw them in there.
Just imagine what it would be like inside the toilet when you get out after
relieving yourself. You definitely would not want to look back because you
know it’s awful. Yet some heartless parents dump their babies there.

Children who are neglected grow up not knowing parental love and no
cultural rituals are performed for them. They do not even know their
surnames and they cannot tell who their parents are. To all those who do
all these horrendous things to children, we say to them, they should watch
out, Tapsi may be a short dog, but the arm of the law is definitely long.
And justice will catch up with them one day. Chairperson, there is one word
that I did not mention because it would have been said it is
unparliamentary.

Some parents do not bother about fetching their children from schools and
crèches in the afternoons, and the poor children end up sleeping there.
What does it mean when a parent is comfortably sleeping in his bed not
knowing where his child is? In Sesotho they say: They are doing shameful
things. A certain man killed his own child and buried it in the yard. As if
that was not enough, he built a shack on top of that grave. He and his wife
spent 16 years walking on top of that child. They were eating, drinking,
sleeping, and waking up all these years walking on top of the child. That
is a disgrace.
With this Bill, we are making a pledge to the children of South Africa as a
whole, even those that are neglected, that they will never be abused again.
And concerning all what they said and the pain that they are feeling, I can
say as soon as this Bill is signed by the President, they will never be
harassed again. The arm of the law will be strong and those who do not take
care of their children will be punished.

Those who manage the places that keep children need to upgrade those places
and the caring should be good. Foster parents need to be vigilant too. They
must give these children love and warmth because the government pays money
for them to be fed and educated. They should not do like one woman who took
her children and locked them up in a kennel and went out to drink liquor
with the children’s grant. The Bill also caters for the youth and child
care centres. These will spread throughout the cities.

In conclusion, I am saying we are grateful to the Minister for passing this
Bill in order to make the children’s lives better.  As members, we say:
Forward with children’s rights! Thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms H LAMOELA: Hon Chair, hon Minister and colleagues, the Children’s
Amendment Bill is intended for amending the Children’s Act of 2005. The
objectives of the Bill are to insert certain definitions; provide for
partial care and early childhood development; provide for protection of
children; provide for prevention and early intervention services; provide
for children in alternative care; provide for foster care; provide for
child and youth care centres; provide shelters and drop-in centres; and
finally, to create certain new offences relating to children.

The amending children’s Bill, to my knowledge, will become one of the most
important pieces of legislation, addressing the needs of children,
especially in South Africa. This piece of legislation is indeed protecting
the constitutional rights of children, such as protection against neglect,
maltreatment, abuse and degradation, and to ensure that children are free
from all forms of violence. The DA thus believes that children deserve
equal services, no matter how poor or how rural.

Agb Voorsitter, tydens ons publieke verhore rakende hierdie belangrike stuk
wetgewing was dit baie bemoedigend om te vind dat ons gemeenskappe die erns
van die implikasies van wetgewing, veral rondom die kind, besef het. Hoe
anders kon insette van tekortkominge in die wetgewing deurgegee word as die
wie juis praktiese probleme ondervind en verwerk nie deelname gegun was
nie? Waardevolle insette en aanbevelings wat groot meriete inhou was
deurgegee en ek wil dus ’n ernstige beroep op die departement doen om na
die praktiese kant van die aanbevelings te kyk en dit in die regulasies in
te sluit. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, during our public hearings concerning this important
piece of legislation it was very encouraging to find that our communities
have realised the seriousness of the implications of legislation,
particularly concerning the child. How else could inputs of shortcomings in
our legislation be passed on if the ones who are experiencing and dealing
with the practical problems are in fact the ones who are not given the
opportunity to participate? Valuable inputs and recommendations that hold
great merit were passed on, and I would therefore wish to make a serious
appeal to the department to look at the practicalities of the
recommendations and include them in the regulations.]

Provinces will be playing a pivotal role in implementing and monitoring the
amended Children’s Bill by ensuring that services reach the most
vulnerable, poorest of the poor and needy children. Provinces need to
ensure the availability of places of safety and implement foster care. They
are responsible for registration and monitoring of shelters and drop-in
centres, and need to ensure skills for implementation of the Bill.

The severe lack of social workers, auxiliary workers and statutory social
workers remains a great concern for the successful implementation of the
Bill. If we are to reach the number of social workers the costing report
suggests, we need decisive action. We need to use all available skills in
our country to assist social workers who are generally burnt out and
overwhelmed. High caseloads and poor working conditions lead to poor
quality of services to service recipients.

To my knowledge, the average caseload for social workers in South Africa is
a staggering 1:300, while in the UK it is 1:22. Social workers thus need to
be provided with resources to enable them to execute their work.
Implementation of this Bill, with the extreme shortage of social workers
experienced, is thus highly questioned.

NRO’s is erg onderbefonds en kan geensins goed funksioneer met die
persentasie fondse ontvang nie. Alhoewel hierdie organisasies ’n groot
impak op die implementering van die wetgewing maak word hulle gekniehalter
deur onvoldoende fondse. Daar moet indringend gekyk word na groter
befondsing om die gehalte van sorg te verhoog.

As ons dan ons belofte aan ons kinders respekeer en wil beoefen, moet ons
getrou bly aan ons grondwetlike plig wat die implementering en begroting
van wetgewing en dienste behels en beïnvloed. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[NGOs are experiencing a serious lack of funding and can by no means
function properly with the funds that they are receiving. Even though these
organisations have a major impact on the implementation of the legislation,
they are hampered by insufficient funds. There should be an in-depth probe
into how funding could be increased in order to improve the quality of
care.
So, if we want to respect our promise to our children and keep it, we have
to be true to our constitutional obligation with regard to the
appropriation of money for the implementation of legislation and services.]

Hon Chair, this brings me to section 28 of the Bill of Rights entitled,
Children, and my question now is: How do we raise children who do not even
have homes or shelters to live in? How do we raise children who were
orphaned long before they knew how to live or what life is like within a
family circle? And need I remind you of our HIV/Aids pandemic? How do we do
this with a Constitution that is supposed to shield these children from
hardships, yet fail them? Many of our children in rural and remote rural
areas carry the scars of orphanage, hunger, abuse, neglect, maltreatment
and degradation.

The Bill is not clear on refugee children. Are they not to be included in
the definition of a child? They too are vulnerable and needy children who
need to attend school and enjoy quality of life and health care.

In South Africa there is no co-ordinating vision for ECD and nobody really
knows where the money is situated. Our hon Minister of Finance did not even
mention ECD in his Budget Speech.

The Aids pandemic sweeping through our country is creating about 835
orphans per day. Over the next year we expect another 300 000 children to
have lost their parents. Government is aware of the magnitude of this
crisis as it is their own costing report that points to the underfunding.
The question must be asked: Do the officials know what their
responsibilities are with regard to the Child Care Act and do they have any
idea of how desperate the situation is on the ground?

A provincial breakdown on the severity of the underfunding in each province
shows Limpopo at 91,14%; the Eastern Cape at 79,3%; Mpumalanga at 72,91%;
Gauteng at 70,89%; the Free State at 68,65%; North West at 63,22%; KwaZulu-
Natal at 59,4%; Western Cape at 17,15%; and Northern Cape at 123% - and the
Northern Cape was over-funded by 23%.

In conclusion, I would like to say that, while two-thirds of our children
grow up in poverty, where children are always affected the most, the
challenge now is to ensure that children know their rights and that they
can exercise their rights without fear. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, children in South
Africa have long been faced with multiple challenges such as poverty, child
abuse, lack of access to basic services and HIV/Aids. The IFP therefore
acknowledges the positive spirit of this complex law which focuses
attention on the needs of children holistically. However, the IFP feels
that some of the issues affecting children’s lives, such as poverty,
HIV/Aids and violence directed at children, as well as various issues
affecting our youth have not been addressed.

The IFP believes that it is important for government and the NGOs to assist
parents in developing constructive and modest methods of discipline. Many
parents don’t know how to discipline their children, except by using
corporal punishment. If they are not given alternatives, they will be left
frustrated and confused as to how to deal with the misbehaviour of their
children. This will also prevent the prosecution of parents who use
inappropriate forms of discipline.

There exists a great need to support families to look after their children
so as to prevent abuse and neglect from occurring. Mere legislation is not
enough. Effective implementation of this legislation will require
government to employ more service personnel such as social workers and
psychologists to work together with the community. It will also require the
existence of support mechanisms such as day care centres, parenting classes
and community leisure activities such as sports fields.

Ukukhulisa umntwana ngendlela eyiyo kulele kakhulu emndenini, kubaba
nomama. IsiZulu sithi libunjwa liseva; injalo iphuma edunjini. Thina bazali
kudinga sihlale phansi sidingide ukuthi yini eyenza kube nje ezweni lonke.
Kungabe yisimanjemanje namalungelo aso? Okanye  yingoba sesilahle amagugu
ethu esizwe saduma nawezinye izizwe? Asazi. Imibuzo le okufanele
iphendulwe.

Ukudlwengula okungaka ezweni lethu akukaze kubonwe emandulo. Ukubulawa
kwabantwana okungaka akukaze kubonwe emandulo. Ukukhulelwa okungaka akukaze
kubonwe emandulo. Kukhona okusilahlekele thina njengesizwe. Kudingeka
sihlale phansi sakhe kabusha. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follow.)

[The appropriate moral development of a child is mainly the responsibility
of the parents, the father and the mother. Two Zulu expressions validate
this claim: the clay is moulded whilst it is still soft and the other is,
the apple does not fall far from the tree. We the parents need to sit down
and investigate the reasons for the whole country to be like this. Could
this be as a result of the new order and its rights? Or is it because we
have abandoned our own cultures as a nation and chose to practise those of
other nations? We do not know. These are questions that need to be
answered.

The continuous surge in rape cases in our country has never been seen
before. And the merciless killing of children is appalling. The high
pregnancy rate we are seeing now has never been seen before. There is
something that we have lost as a nation. We need to sit down and build
afresh.]

We are faced with a dilemma, but we need to come together, collectively,
sit down and scrutinise to see what has led to this disaster.

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Madam Chair, the Bill, as it is introduced to the NCOP,
determined in section 139 ...

... die volgende, naamlik dat die gemene reg en die gewoontereg herroep is.
Ek het nie ’n weergawe gekry van die gewysigde wetsontwerp wat vandag voor
die Raad dien nie, ek moes dit op die internet kry. As ’n mens op die
internet kyk na die wysiging wat nou voor die Raad is en waarvan ek ’n
weergawe via die internet bekom het, verbied dit enige lyfstraf of ander
onmenslike of vernederende straf. Dit is in artikel 139(2).

Dit herroep dan ook die gemeenregtelike verweer van billike tugtiging, maar
dit spreek nie die gewoonteregtelike aspek aan nie. Nou ontstaan hier ’n
vraag: Wat is die posisie in hierdie verband? Die gewoonteregtelike
magtiging om te tugtig bly nog steeds staan, dit is in terme van die
internetweergawe, dit wil sê die tradisionele leiers en die tradisionele
howe se tugbevoegdheid word nie geraak nie. Dit is soos dit geïnterpreteer
word. Dit skep regsonsekerheid en die dubbelslagtigheid hiervan sal
sekerlik nog in die howe gaan draai.

Die VF Plus is terdeë bewus van die euwels wat gepaard gaan met die
misbruik en wreedheid met betrekking tot kinders. Dit kom toenemend voor.
Maar om wetsgehoorsame ouers wat verantwoordelik met die opvoeding en
tugtiging van hul kinders omgaan te wil kriminaliseer, soos hierdie wet
spesifiek in hierdie artikel doen, is verkeerd. Dit is ironies dat dit juis
kom in ’n tydperk waar onderwysers staak vanweë, onder meer, swak
skooldissipline en lae salarisse. Dit gaan oor die dissipline by die skool.
Dit is baie moeilik. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[... the following, namely that the common law and customary law were
repealed. I did not receive a copy of the amended Bill that is being tabled
before the Council today; I had to find it on the Internet. When one looks
at the amendment on the Internet, that is now before the Council and the
version that I obtained via the Internet, it prohibits corporal punishment
or any inhumane or degrading punishment. This is contained in section
139(2).

This then also revokes the common law defence of fair punishment, but it
does not address customary law. A question now arises: What is the position
in this regard? In terms of the Internet version, the authority to correct
in terms of common law still remains. This means that the function of
traditional leaders and traditional courts to correct is not affected. This
is how it is being interpreted. It creates uncertainty in the law and the
ambiguity around this will certainly still end up in the courts.
The FF Plus is thoroughly aware of the evils associated with the abuse of
and cruelty to children. This is on the increase. But it is wrong to
criminalise law-abiding parents, who deal responsibly with their children’s
education and discipline, in the way that this Bill is doing it in this
specific section. It is ironic that it is appearing exactly at a time when
teachers are striking because of poor school discipline and low salaries
among others. It deals with discipline at school which is very complex.]

There is another possibility that can arise. If I have a vexatious or a
frivolous neighbour and I chastise my child one way or another, he can go
and lay a charge against me for assaulting my child. By doing that, however
unlikely he is to succeed, he can burden me with a lot of litigation, and
that is what we must prevent.
Ongelukkig, vanweë hierdie spesifieke klousule in die wetsontwerp, sal die
VF Plus nie, ten spyte van ander baie goeie aspekte in die wetsontwerp, die
wetsontwerp kan ondersteun nie. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Unfortunately, the FF Plus cannot support this Bill, despite the other
very good aspects of the Bill, because of this specific clause. I thank
you.]

Mrs B L MATLOAHELA: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members, the ID
will always commend where commendment is appropriate. Also, the ID will
criticise positively where it is essential.
One should expect educators to educate within the framework of the
Constitution of this country, including the rights of a child as stipulated
in the Bill of Rights. However, it has been found that a child was locked
inside a classroom after hours and stayed there the whole night - a child
of eight years of age. This occurred during 2005, for which the state is
now being sued. This occurrence at Bela-Bela, in Limpopo province – through
the Chair, take note hon Sibiya – is a grave contravention of the rights of
a child who should be enjoying protection from all sources of abuse,
according to the Bill of Rights. Mamakwa Primary School should serve as an
example for the protection of the rights of a child.

Child-headed households must be legally recognised and be supported by the
state, unless the state has ample accommodation for such children. What is
also overlooked or accepted in our country is underage pregnancies.
Sentences are not tight enough on those who contravene the laws prohibiting
sexual intercourse with children, which causes children to have children.
Surely, this kind of child abuse should be severely dealt with and child
protection services should be intensified. All children are vulnerable and
the laws of this country should address this practically. Thank you.

Mr N D HENDRICKSE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the
children of this country are our future. Many great men and women of the
world have come from very poor and trying backgrounds. We dare not fail
them! Therefore, caring for our children the way this Bill seeks to provide
is commendable.

Taking into account the scourge of HIV/Aids and the fact that many
households lose their parents, the sad reality is that the older children
have to care for their siblings and therefore child-headed households have
become a common phenomenon and it is only a given that these households
must be eligible for a grant. The Bill provides for this and we are very
grateful for it.

Removal of children from their families cannot be left to the report of a
social worker but rather to the findings of a child psychologist. Section
186 states that, once a child is placed in foster care, no further
supervision by a social worker is required, for two years. This could be
problematic, as children need to ease into their foster home, and if they
are desperately unhappy, they need to be able to speak to somebody in
authority. A monitoring period of at least six months should be considered.

Existing schools of industry and reform schools will now become child and
youth care centres. My concern, however, is that the Bill does not spell
out in detail the type of industrial programme for the youth, ie training
for a trade qualification etc. It also does not speak to the separation of
youth who are orphans and those who have serious drug issues with the law.

Bodies consisting of businesspeople should be established to assist in
finding employment for the youth who leave these institutions. They should
be housed in family units with housemothers and housefathers for at least a
year, thus breaking the cycle of crime by so doing.

The Bill further provides for the housing of street children. This must be
commended, as they are extremely vulnerable in our community. I want to say
to this House that in 1960, an organisation I was with put out a car
sticker which read: “Did you hug your child today?” I would like to
recommend this to members of the House, not only to hug their children but
also to listen to their children and to spread that. We support the Bill.
Thank you. [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon House Chairperson, hon Minister,
hon Deputy Minister in absentia, distinguished special delegates in
absentia, representatives and members of civil society formations in the
public gallery, hon members, friends and comrades, the debates and passage
of the Children’s Amendment Bill marks a culmination of a long, tedious and
robust process of engagement between the national Department of Social
Development and the Select Committee on Social Services, which has been
replicated in our legislatures.

The timing of the debate and the passage of this Bill, this afternoon,
coincides with historical milestones that cannot go unnoticed by this
august House, namely that in the next two weeks it will be the 31st
anniversary of the Soweto youth uprising, which has changed the political
landscape of this country - and that cannot be reversed.

In the next two days, the world will be celebrating the International
Children’s Day, where the entire progressive humanity will be rededicating
its effort towards a caring and just society where children are free. More
importantly, it takes place on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the
Congress of South African Students, a revolutionary student organisation,
the first of the revolutionary youth movements after the banning of the
Congress Youth League to raise the banner of the Freedom Charter within the
streets of South Africa as a vision for postapartheid South Africa.

We owe it as a nation and as a country to the Congress of South African
Students that the fighting youth of the 1980s adopted the Freedom Charter
under the slogan “Each one, Teach one”, not only as the vision for the
future but, more importantly, as an alternative syllabus to the damaging
education system imposed by apartheid.

Therefore the constitutional principles in the Bill of Rights, which give
effect to the rights of a child to education, should be a cause for
celebration of the heroic struggles of the youth under the banner of Cosas,
against the inhumane system of Bantu education.

As we pass this Bill this afternoon, two days before the International
Children’s Day and on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of this giant
student movement, it is fitting that we, once more, lower our banners in
memory of those youths who died in the line of duty in pursuit of the
rights of children.

To the young generations of the youth that is learning in our country, it
is fitting that we make this call that you should emulate the revolutionary
legacy of service to the nation embraced by the founders of Cosas, in
particular the late Comrade Ephraim Mogale, the founding president of the
Congress of South African Students, who dedicated his entire life to the
service of the nation for no material rewards.

We therefore call upon the youth of our country to join hands with
government by reclaiming the streets to make South Africa a liberated zone
for the children of our country. I think that message is important, as we
observe June 16, the 28th anniversary of Cosas and the death of Comrade
Ephraim Mogale, who died whilst he was a member of the provincial
legislature in Limpopo and also served as a founding president of the
Congress of South African Students.

We in the ANC enter this debate inspired with confidence that ours in
children’s rights represent the best of human development traditions. We
acknowledge, with clear minds, that the rights of children in South Africa
are not just about welfare services – I think I must emphasise this – and
we are not enacting this legislation to create a welfare charity regime for
children, but it should be understood within the context of a developmental
trajectory of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.

So, it is quite critical, much as all of us do acknowledge, that some of
the implications or obligations this Bill is going to impose on our
government with its limited resources, are not going to be realised within
the short-term period. It is critically important that we reclaim our
historic traditional way of doing things that has brought our liberation;
that we mobilise the masses of our people within our communities to be the
brigades that defend all these rights that we are speaking about in this
legislation, because you cannot accuse the Constitution of the Republic of
South Africa that it is failing children when criminals are molesting
children, when criminals are violating the rights of the children, when
these particular criminal incidents are taking place within the privacy of
the homes where we belong, in our own neighbourhoods.

It therefore rest upon us as public representatives as to what role are we
playing over and above coming audaciously on this public platform to blame
the Constitution and to blame the shortage of social workers on all these
crimes that are being committed against our children. I think it is
important.

The Children’s Amendment Bill before us this afternoon-provides a legal
framework for the implementation of the broad values, norms and standards
articulated in the Children’s Act of 2005. The amending Bill creates legal
certainty and uniformity of standards in the provision of partial care of
children, early childhood development, prevention and early intervention
services for children in alternative care.

We’ll agree and we’ll remember that the drafting process of this Bill
started as early as 1997, when the SA Law Reform Commission was requested
to investigate and review the Child Act, Act 74 of 1983 and to make
recommendations to the Minister of Social Development. This review was
necessitated by a number of shortcomings in the country’s legislative
instruments dealing with children, central to which was the fact that most
of the then existing laws were designed to cater for the small minority of
our country’s children. That is the reality.

The fact that we have backlogs today is because all resources and all the
laws that were there before 1994 were not catering for the rights of the
majority of the children in this country. We must take collective
responsibility for the enormity of the challenges that are confronting us,
in relation to the plight of the children in our country.

The Bill deals with the service delivery part of the broad principles,
norms and standards articulated in that particular Act. In terms of our
constitutional dispensation, the thrust of this Bill constitutes the core
functions of provinces within our multisphere system of governance. I’m not
sure to what extent hon members are speaking on behalf of their provinces,
because as far as I’m concerned, all provinces have actually voted
unanimously in favour of this Bill, with the exception of a few, of course,
on a technical basis.

Provinces have interrogated and examined their own conditions, with respect
to what kind of resources they have, both human and financial, as well as
the infrastructure they have, on the basis of saying that we agree with
this particular Bill.

I must say that social ills affecting children in South Africa are not the
creation of the Constitution, Act 108 of 1996, but they are the social
problems that are a legacy of the past and they are confronting us today.
All of us must break ranks with the past to confront those challenges as we
encounter them.

It therefore becomes critical for all of us to strengthen the NGO sector
that deals with children, as a rallying point for community support towards
government intervention. I want to repeat: Crime is a social problem.
Although it has economic ramifications, crime against children and
violations of children’s rights are a social problem to the extent that
communities are united across the political spectrum, because what affects
hon Thetjeng’s child should accordingly affect me in the neighbourhood.

If we begin to transcend those particular narrow political divides in
dealing with the debate on children, I think our country will move a step
further, whereby we’ll be able to say that, as a community, we have
succeeded without putting any blame on social workers, inefficiency of the
police, lack of police vehicles and all those kinds of things.

In conclusion, I want to call on this House to consolidate a people’s
contract for a better life for our children. The ANC supports the Bill. I
thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Chairperson, ladies and
gentlemen, members of this House, it seems there is an agreement among us
all that there is a need to protect and ensure the lives of our children in
our communities, and that we should all be part and parcel of that process
of ensuring that the children that we have in our midst, in our
communities, get better assistance and protection.

That cannot be the task of the government alone; it is the task, basically,
that faces each and every South African adult. And this, basically, is not
a new thing, especially in South Africa and, more importantly, amongst
Africans and the people of South Africa that were formerly discriminated
against; that the question of looking after children becomes not the issue
of the family alone, but of the community as a whole. So this Bill tries to
put that in legal terms and puts it as a duty of all South Africans to be
able to do that.

As hon Setona has just said, this Bill has taken a long time. It has been
there in front of us as a legislature for more than nine to 10 years, and
we have been talking about it. We have been wanting to deal with these
issues. It was one of the first things that we did as a government when we
came into power in 1994. We said that you cannot claim in South Africa any
socioeconomic right as an individual, but that can only be done by a child.
The basis of that argument was that all of us should be able to attain
those rights through the child. Quite honestly, I think it has taken quite
a long time, and quite rightly and justly so.

Quite a number of people were a little bit annoyed by the time that it has
taken. I do feel they might have been justified, but I think it was
necessary that this Bill should be considered as thoroughly as possible so
that, out of it, we can be able to say we have done what we have put down
on paper and in law regarding what ought to be done for the betterment of
our children.

But also, quite obviously, as many members have said, this Bill will call
on us all to be on guard and we need to participate. The reality is that
some issues have been raised about the question of social workers,
psychologists, doctors and all those people. We do not have enough of them
to be able to satisfy what this Bill requires. It is something that all of
us have to work on and be able to provide.

Quite obviously, the budget is there - I want to say so. The budget is
there in each and every province. To a certain extent, we are sure that it
is not enough and to the best of our ability, it is in the provinces.
Special emphasis is on ECD, its usage in a better way, its strengthening
and the protection of children. It is the duty of all members of this House
and all legislators of the National Assembly to ensure that that budget is
used rightfully.

It might not be enough, I believe, but it is in the hands of the provinces.
I think what we will be doing right through is to come back to this House
many many a time to find out exactly how it is being used and whether it is
being used correctly or not. We are controlling and monitoring it.

Quite obviously there are many things that will come out of that. Firstly,
there is enough money. I think some money that we have set aside, as we
have said before, is intended for the training of psychologists and social
workers. What we ought to do in each and every village is to encourage our
matriculants and students to ask for bursaries. I know there are not
enough, but you must ask for the bursaries so that by the end of this year
we know how much of that money has been used, in order to be able to do
that.

But also, this budget provides for ECD so that we should be able to employ
all those graduates whom we have been interested in, who have no employment
at present and are within our communities. We have also agreed with quite a
number of universities that they should be part and parcel of training of
these specialists, that is social workers, psychologists and all the others
who will take care of the children.

Quite obviously, the Bill might not encompass everything that we wanted it
to. It is quite a challenge and we hope that some of those issues that have
not been encompassed by the Bill will necessarily be encompassed and be
part and parcel of the regulation that we will be able to put in front of
you, I hope, before the end of this year. I should appeal generally to all
of you to be part and parcel of that process.

We also have hopes that this ECD programme will be able to provide as many
jobs as possible. Its expansion includes issues that are in the Expanded
Public Works Programme, EPWP, which includes the skilling of ECD
practitioners and increasing the numbers of children who attend ECD
services.

A question was raised by the hon Mrs Lamoela. I think you asked whether the
officials are aware of the implications of the Bill, and I think they are.
Hence they’ve put it quite openly and very clearly that the resources are
not enough.

What we have been told by Treasury was that those resources will be
continuously increased, provided – I repeat - provided that we can prove
beyond any reasonable doubt that they have been used correctly. In this
process, we, as a government, we, as public servants will not be having
that capacity to monitor. We hope you’ll be able to be part and parcel of
this process.

Regarding the FF Plus, I understand your concerns, but this is 2007; it is
not during the time that you and I grew up. There is the UN, there are some
basic standards that have been set internationally on how to bring up
children. It has been found beyond any reasonable doubt that sometimes this
chastising of children is not very fruitful. Hence, we are saying parents -
I think one of the speakers here has said it too - should find ways in
which they can discipline their children without using violence, because
violence breeds violence. This country has so much violence that we should
try by all means not to encourage these ways of dealing with issues
relating to discipline amongst our children. We would really appeal to the
House to ensure and monitor that, and to ensure that this Bill is
implemented as quickly as possible.

I think, as Mr Setona has just said here, it is quite important that we
should, when this Bill leaves this House and goes to the President, be able
to say that there is something that we have achieved as South Africans in
that mission that we have set ourselves to build a better life for South
Africans.

It is a step that we should be proud of, because if we can all think back
about 10 to 20 years ago, one of the first things that we ever did as the
ANC in our struggle against apartheid was to sit down amongst ourselves,
long before 1990 - I think it was 1987 - and look at the plight of our
children in South Africa in the midst of that violence. We did that in
Harare, under the leadership of Oliver Tambo, to raise the consciousness of
the world on the issues of children in our country. And, from then onwards,
we started moving together, not only as the ANC, but the broad society of
South Africa, to work together towards a Constitution that has brought us
here today to be what we are as this country, the South Africa that we are
and the democracy that we are building.

So we hope that, through this process, we will be able to unite as a
community, as provinces and as a country to ensure that we do fulfil the
promise that we have made to thousands of our people, and the whole world
is looking at us. Many people have laid down their lives to make sure that
these children, including Mr Setona here, could have a better life. I’ve
just been thinking that when we were running around in 1976 he must have
been about six or seven years old. Now he has given us a good lecture –
actually a really good first-class lecture! [Laughter.] We should be proud
of our youth. Once again, thanks a lot to him. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Ouestion put.

Bill accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the
Constitution.

                 GOVERNMENT IMMOVABLE ASSET MANAGEMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)
Mr R J TAU: Chairperson, basically, what we are presenting to the House is
a Bill that seeks to facilitate the management of the process of immovable
property in government. We have realised, for a very long time, that the
fragmentation and disorientation of government, and the need for it to be
able to manage and co-ordinate its immovable property, have created a lot
of problems in terms of accountability concerning the immovable property
and the regime itself.

The Bill seeks to provide for a uniform framework for the management of an
immovable asset that is held by a national or provincial department, to
ensure the co-ordination of the use of the immovable asset with the service
delivery objective, because that is very key and critical that the
objectives of service delivery must always be taken into account. The Bill
further seeks to provide for issuing of guidelines and minimum standards in
respect of immovable asset management by national or provincial
departments, and to provide for matters incidental thereto.

Having noted the problems experienced by the national and provincial
governments in relation to the management of the immovable property, this
Bill therefore seeks to bring about transformation in the management regime
in providing that uniform capacity in terms of the immovable asset
management framework to promote accountability and transparency within
government. You would find that, for a very long time, the situation has
been that the immovable assets that are being managed by the departments,
whether at provincial or national levels, because of this lack of
infrastructure of managing the immovable assets, and sometimes even the
disposal of these assets create serious problems at provincial and national
levels. So, the Bill will ensure effective immovable asset management
within government.

Also, of particular importance is to ensure co-ordination of the use of
immovable assets with service delivery objects of national or provincial
departments. Therefore, with this piece of legislation, we will be able to
bring about better co-ordination of the immovable asset regime.

We therefore, as the Select Committee on Public Services, put this Bill
before the House for adoption. Thank you very much, Chair.

Debate concluded.

Question put.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Order! I shall now put the question
in respect of the Third Order. The question is that the Bill be agreed to.
In accordance with Rule 63, I shall first allow political parties the
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they so wish. Is there
any political party wishing to make any declaration of vote? There is none.

We shall now also proceed to the voting on the question. Those in favour
will say “Aye”.

Hon MEMBERS: Aye!

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Those against will say “No”. I think
the ayes have it. The majority of members have voted in favour. I therefore
declare the Bill agreed to in terms of section 75 of the Constitution.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

       CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS IN MOBILE EQUIPMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, hon members, this is a very intricate and
complicated title: The Convention on International Interests in Mobile
Equipment Bill. And it is not often that I have 10 minutes at my disposal
to explain a complicated title in detail. So, I would implore the House to
please be quiet, including Mr Goeieman, and listen carefully. [Laughter.]

The above-mentioned Bill ratifies South Africa’s obligations on matters
specific to aircraft equipment, with a view to overcome problems
experienced in obtaining secure and readily enforceable rights in aircraft
objects.

The main issue is the widely differing approaches of different legal
systems to security and title reservations, engendering uncertainty among
intending financiers regarding the efficacy of their rights. This inhibits
the extension of finance and increases borrowing costs, particularly in
developing countries.

A diplomatic conference to adopt the convention and the protocol was held
in Cape Town from 29 October to 16 November 2001, under the auspices of the
International Institute for the Unification of Private Law and the
International Civil Aviation Organisation, at the South African
government’s invitation. That was six years ago. Sixty-eight states and 14
international organisations attended the conference and the majority have
signed, ratified and acceded to the convention.

No objections were received from the public after gazetting. All the
aircraft-related South African associations, together with the Chief State
Law Adviser in international law and the Department of Transport, found the
convention to be in compliance and not contentious.

The Select Committee on Public Services therefore, having considered the
subject of the Bill [B1-2007] referred to, reports that it has agreed to
the Bill and begs this House to do likewise. I thank you, Sir. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Order! Hon members, I shall now put
the question in respect of the Fourth Order. The question is that the Bill
be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 63 I shall first allow political
parties the opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they so wish.
Is there any party that wants to make a declaration? There is obviously
none. We shall now proceed to the voting on the question. Those in favour
will say “Aye”.

Hon MEMBERS: Aye!

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Those against will say “No”. I think
the ayes have it. The majority of members have voted in favour. I therefore
declare the Bill agreed to in terms of section 75 of the Constitution.
[Applause.]

Bill agreed to in accordane with section 75 of the Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - PROTOCOL ON
    FINANCE AND INVESTMENT OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY

                                 (Statement)
Mr E M SOGONI: Chairperson, only Friday last week, 25 May 2007, we
celebrated Africa Day; a day that symbolises a renewed sense of our
identity; a day that symbolises the unity of African people against all
forms of oppression, colonialism and imperialism. These freedoms came with
new challenges of confronting poverty and underdevelopment head-on
throughout our region. Together we have to build a better Africa and the
world.

The ANC and the people of South Africa have a long tradition of
international engagement and solidarity with the people of Africa, in
particular. Our fortunes as a nation are intimately interconnected with
those of our neighbours in the SADC region. With this protocol, we seek to
expedite our advance in regional economic integration, economic growth and
tax harmonisation throughout this region.

The SADC heads of state have taken a bold step which would incrementally
assist us as Africans in realising our dream of creating a united states of
Africa. This protocol provides a clear programme of action and timeframes
in achieving a common market and currency. Fourteen countries from SADC
participated in this protocol. Seven countries have already signed the
protocol. The remaining will sign the protocol after completing their in-
country process.

The highlights of the protocol are, firstly, to create a favourable
investment climate within SADC. Each signatory shall promote investment in
its territory and admit investments in accordance with own laws and
regulations.

The second highlight is to achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability and
convergence within the region in order to achieve and maintain
macroeconomic stability within the region. Signatories shall converge on
stability-oriented economic policies implemented through a sound
institutional structure and framework. Stability-oriented economic
policies, in relation to a signatory, include, but are not limited to,
restricting inflation to low and stable levels, and maintaining a prudent
fiscal stance based on the avoidance of large budget deficits and financing
deficits by primary money and government guaranteed debt to GDP. The
macroeconomic convergence shall be measured and monitored by indicators
such as the rate of inflation, ratio of budget deficit to GDP and the
balance and structure of the current account.

Thirdly, to co-operate in respect of taxation and related matters,
signatories shall, in the interest of SADC, develop arrangements such as
professionalism and expertise of tax officials throughout the region,
endeavour a common approach to the treatment and application of tax
incentives and harmonisation of the administration of indirect taxes.

Fourthly, in order to co-operate and co-ordinate central banks of
signatories on exchange control policies, the signatories shall co-operate
and co-ordinate exchange control policies to liberalise current account
transactions and achieve full currency convertibility amongst them.

I must implore colleagues in this House that the task of building the
African continent is a long one. The journey must first begin at a regional
level which this protocol is tasked to undertake. The foundation of a
brighter continent would be built once these protocols are implemented. The
members can contribute in their various regional and continental structures
in order to ensure that the vision of an African Renaissance is realised.

Chairperson, in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution, we would like
to implore this House to adopt this convention. Thank you, Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Order! That concludes the debate. I
shall now put the question in respect of the Fifth Order. The question is
that the report be agreed to. As this decision is dealt with in terms of
section 65 of the Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether all
delegation heads are present in the House.

I shall now also allow provinces the opportunity to make their declarations
of vote, in terms of Rule 71, if they so wish. Is there any province
wishing to make any declaration of vote? There is obviously none.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall do this in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must please indicate to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against or abstain from voting.
