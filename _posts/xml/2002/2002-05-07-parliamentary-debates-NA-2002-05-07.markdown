                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr A MLANGENI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the hon Charles Nqakula and the hon Nosiviwe Mapisa-
       Nqakula have been appointed Minister of Safety and Security and
       Deputy Minister of Home Affairs respectively;


  (2) congratulates these hon Members on their appointments; and


  (3) wishes them good luck on their new assignments. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! There still seems to be some problem with the
microphones. It seems that the rows at the end of the IFP - and it would
seem the DP, as well - are unable to hear. [Interjections.] Could you
please wear your earpieces for the moment.

I am sorry about that. We will now proceed with Notices of Motion.

Mev P W CUPIDO: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek sal
voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van die Nuwe NP se besluit om nie aan enige
       tussenverkiesings in Suid-Afrika deel te neem nie;


  (2) ook kennis neem van die rede wat die Nuwe NP voorgee vir hulle
       lafhartige besluit om weg te kruip, naamlik dat hulle eerder vir die
       ``oorstap''-wetgewing wil wag, en dat hulle bang is om die kiesers te
       verwar deur kandidate voor te stel;


  (3) saamstem dat die Nuwe NP se vrese net 'n verdere bewys is van die
       party se ontsettende tekort aan kiesersondersteuning, en dat hulle
       niks het om die ANC te bied in ruil vir die beloofde eersteklas-
       sitplek op die soustrein nie; en


     4) 'n beroep doen op die Nuwe NP om hul politieke opportunisme op die
        proef te stel deur die kiesers se opinies te vra en om hulle
        beskikbaar te stel om aan tussenverkiesings deel te neem.
        [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the New NP's decision not to participate in any by-elections in
       South Africa;
  (2) also notes the reason offered by the New NP for their cowardly
       decision to hide away, namely that they rather want to wait for the
       legislation pertaining to crossing to the floor and that they are
       afraid of confusing voters by proposing candidates;


  (3) agrees that the New NP's fears are merely further proof of the
       party's enormous shortage of voter support, and that they have
       nothing to offer the ANC in return for the promised first-class seat
       on the gravy train; and


  (4) appeals to the New NP to put their political opportunism to the test
       by asking for the voters' opinions and to make themselves available
       for participation in by-elections.

[Interjections.]]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:
  That the House -


  (1) takes delight in the news that Chapman's Peak will get some revival
       as reconstruction on it is underway;


  (2) acknowledges the sophisticated engineering work that will be employed
       to prevent the falling rocks that are a tourist and environmental
       hazard;


  (3) also appreciates that the reconstruction will resuscitate the
       business that went down immediately after the closure; and


  (4) wishes this venturesome exercise the success it deserves.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Western Cape MECs for Housing, Local Government and
       Social Services are co-ordinating their plans to deal with any
       flooding this year;


  (2) recognises that the ANC MEC for Social Services, Marius Fransman, has
       met with the joint operating committee and disaster management team,
       and is instituting a programme for awareness in communities and
       setting up disaster management teams in specific areas; and


  (3) congratulates the government of the Western Cape for its co-
       ordinated, preventative approach to managing the hardship that
       affects the poor when the Western Cape experiences winter storms.
[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I will move on the next
sitting day:


  That the House -
  (1) censures the ANC Youth League for recklessly attacking the Judge
       President of the Transvaal, Bernard Ngoepe, and his judgment in the
       Matloha case, as their actions and their foolish calls on Government
       to intervene in court cases undermine the rule of law, a Constitution
       of which we can be justly proud and the judiciary;


  (2) calls on the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development to
       reaffirm his commitment to the independence of the Bench; and


  (3) calls on the ANC Youth League to rather devote their considerable
       energies to the fight against HIV/Aids and poverty, and to leave
       beauty pageants and the courts alone.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at the
next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the start of construction on a gas pipeline from the Temane
       gas field in Mozambique to Secunda in Mpumalanga;


  (2) recognises that this project not only emphasises the cost
       -effectiveness of alternative fuels such as gas, as opposed to coal
       mining, but also has huge job creation potential;


  (3) welcomes the job creation potential of this project and urges Sasol
       to ensure that the local inhabitants of these respective regions
       benefit directly from such ventures; and


  (4) calls on all Southern African countries to co-operate with  each
       other in similar projects with special emphasis on job creation and
       environmental sensitivity.
[Applause.]

Mr R P ZONDO: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that the Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Scorpions have
        closed in on a syndicate which allegedly defrauded the City of Cape
        Town of millions of rands, and have arrested four people on charges
        of fraud, theft and corruption;


  (2) further notes that offices of the Department of Minerals and Energy
        in Klerksdorp and Kimberley have been raided by the Scorpions,
        following alleged corruption by staff members in the department who
        allegedly issued irregular mining licences and mining concessions;
        and


  (3) gives warning to all public servants and contractors doing business
        with the Government that this ANC Government will not tolerate
        abuse of the public purse and will crack down on those who seek to
        defraud the Government and the public with the full force of the
        law.
[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a successful prayer day for transformation in Africa was
       held in eight stadiums across the nation on 21 March 2002, where some
       300 000 Christians prayed for issues facing our nation and Africa;


  (2) that this event was also broadcast to some 20 million  television
       viewers in the United Kingdom and Europe; and


  (3) commends the organisers for their diligence and commitment in uniting
       prayers for our nation and Africa, and calls on all Christians to
       continue upholding our nation, Africa and its leaders in prayer.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek namens
die VF by die volgende sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1) die nie-betaling van munisipale dienstegelde in een jaar feitlik
       verdubbel het van R11,7 miljard tot R22,2 miljard;


  (2) hierdie syfer aandui dat die Regering beheer verloor het oor die nie-
       betaling van dienstegelde, en dat drastiese stappe geneem sal moet
       word om te verhoed dat stadsrade bankrot raak;


  (3) hoër munisipale tariewe 'n noodwendige gevolg gaan wees van die
       Regering se onvermoë om dienstegelde te vorder; en


  (4) dit die VF se standpunt is dat dit onbillik is om van betalers van
       dienstegelde te verwag om hoër tariewe te begin betaal as gevolg van
       nie-betalers van dienstegelde, en dat die VF dus 'n beroep doen op
       die plaaslike stadsrade om drasties teen nie-betalers op te tree.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the nonpayment of municipal service fees has practically doubled in
       one year from R11,7 billion to R22,2 billion;


  (2) this figure indicates that the Government has lost control over the
       nonpayment of service fees and that drastic steps will have to be
       taken in order to keep town councils from going bankrupt;


  (3) higher municipal fees are going to be an inevitable result of the
       Government's inability to collect service fees; and
  (4) it is the FF's contention that it is unfair to expect the people who
       are paying their service fees to start paying higher tariffs because
       of those who are not paying, and the FF therefore appeals to the
       local town councils to take drastic action against people who are not
       paying their service fees.]

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that nearly 90 households forcibly removed from Protea Village
       near Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens are to be resettled there on 13
       hectares of prime real estate;


  (2) recognises that this represents one of the last opportunities for the
       city to integrate a community evicted under apartheid into an
       exclusive area in which they once lived;


  (3) congratulates the ANC Government on another significant step in the
       restitution process; and


   (4)      calls on the surrounding communities to embrace the rebirth of
       this one vital and vibrant community within their midst.
   [Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with disgust, disapproval and concern the campaign of violence
       and intimidation being waged against political opponents of the ANC -
       and against members of the DA in particular - in Crossroads, which
       has resulted in the shooting to date of a DA member and the injuring
       of three others;


  (2) notes with concern that the police have taken no concrete steps to
       stop the violence and to bring the perpetrators to book; and


   (3)      calls on leaders of the ANC to restrain their members and get
       them to respect the constitutional right of all South Africans to
       enjoy free and open political activities.
[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) receives with extreme shock the newspaper report on the motor vehicle
       licence conversion scam in which about 1 500 Mozambican vehicles are
       involved;


  (2) notes with deserving disgust that the Springs vehicle testing centre
       in the East Rand is involved in such a scam;
  (3) takes delight in the fact that the people involved have been arrested
       and remain in custody, pending their reappearance in court in the
       coming weeks; and


  (4) trusts that the trial of this R10 million case will see the criminals
       in jail for a long time, given the magnitude of their scam.

Ms N M TWALA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with grave concern the reports of an impending food crisis in
       our region;


  (2) recognises that, as the largest economy in our region, we have an
       obligation to assist our neighbours to alleviate famine and hardship;
       and


   (3)      assures the people of our region that this House will do all in
       its power to ensure that all efforts are made to alleviate the
       suffering of the people of the region.
[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the action taken by staff at some of South Africa's biggest
       companies and Government departments like the Sars, Absa and Anglo-
       Gold, who are joining the fight against HIV/Aids by donating their
       time, salaries and services to help victims of the disease;


  (2) believes that this positive attitude and action taken by South
       African employees is an example of how we are going to overcome this
       challenge;


  (3) also believes that this underlines the importance of the private
       sector's getting involved; and


   (4)      encourages all South Africans to follow their lead because we
       can all play a role and, no matter how small the contribution, it is
       a step forward in the fight against Aids.
[Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at the next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with deep concern that a new computer system called ``BAS'' and
       untrained staff in the Eastern Cape are starving Eastern Cape
       hospitals of desperately needed state funds;


  (2) further notes with dismay that the Eastern Cape legislature has also
       not yet passed the provincial health department's budget vote for the
       new financial year, which has already begun;


  (3) urgently calls on the MEC for health in the Eastern Cape to stop
       blaming ``capacity problems''; and


  (4) further calls on the Eastern Cape legislature and the Eastern Cape
       MEC for Health to get on with delivery, as people's lives depend on
       their urgent action.

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 30 members of the Uniting Dutch Reformed Church in the
       Free State took part in a protest in Pretoria against apartheid
       within the Dutch Reformed Church;


  (2) recalls that under apartheid this church was divided into different
       churches for different race groups;


  (3) recognises the special role that churches and other religious
       institutions have in promoting reconciliation, integration and
       transformation; and


   (4)      calls on the General Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church to treat
       this matter with due concern and to send a strong message and
       implement an effective strategy for promoting integration and
       harmony throughout its structures.
[Applause.]

                 MARK SHUTTLEWORTH'S OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the outstanding achievement of Mark Shuttleworth, whose journey
       in space was the culmination of a life-long dream;


  (2) believes that the achievements of South Africa's first astronaut are
       an inspiration to all South Africans to realise their ambitions and
       talents;


  (3) recognises that his achievements will inspire many of our youth to
       pursue their studies in the areas of mathematics, science and
       technology; and


  (4) welcomes our Afronaut, Mark Shuttleworth, back to earth and
       acknowledges his contribution to our nation's pursuit of excellence.

Agreed to.

            POSTHUMOUS MUSIC AWARD TO PRINCESS MAGOGO KADINIZULU

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the fact that on 3 May 2002 the South African Musical Award
       was posthumously bestowed upon Princess Magogo kaDinuzulu in
       recognition of her enormous contribution to the preservation of Zulu
       traditional music and song and of her great artistry in skills and
       composition;


  (2) expresses its deep appreciation for this historic event of 4 May,
       when the first fully-fledged African opera titled "Princess Magogo"
       had its world première at the Durban Playhouse, which was
       simultaneously broadcast live in the United States, the United
       Kingdom and New Zealand, and which portrayed with great artistry the
       event which led to the imprisonment of King Dinuzulu after the 1906
       Zulu rebellion and the extraordinary life and deeds of Princess
       Magogo; and


  (3) pays tribute to the memory of Princess Magogo, a daughter of Kings
       who was chosen to fulfil a destiny, which comprised the unification
       of the Zulu nation and the preservation of its ancestral traditions.

Agreed to.

                         RETURN OF SAARTJIE BAARTMAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that in 1810 Saartjie Baartman, a young woman of Quena descent,
       was lured to Europe with promises of wealth and fame, where she was
       horribly degraded by having to appear naked as part of a freak show;


  (2) recognises that death treated her no less kindly, as she was carved
       up by a surgeon who made a cast of her body, preserved her genitals
       and brain and put her skeleton on display in a museum;


  (3) believes that her return with dignity and honour symbolises the
       healing of the South African nation; and


  (4) welcomes wholeheartedly the return home of Saartjie Baartman.
[Applause.]

Agreed to.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                          (The late Mr S V Tshwete)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, on behalf of
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, I move the draft resolution printed
in her name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and sadness the death of the hon Minister Steve
       Vukile Tshwete, who passed away on 26 April 2002;


  (2) recognises that Steve Tshwete was a South African who, throughout his
       life, demonstrated a profound commitment to the liberation of the
       people of this country and the continent of Africa;


  (3) acknowledges the dynamic contribution that Minister Tshwete made in
       this Parliament as a debater, as a Minister and as Leader of
       Government Business;


  (4) believes, in the words of President Thabo Mbeki: ``It is not our part
       to mourn. It is our right and privilege to celebrate the fact that we
       were blessed with so rare a gift of a fellow South African who was
       simultaneously a genuine friend, a trustworthy colleague, an
       activist, a leader, a patriot, an internationalist, a human titan who
       surrendered his life to the cause of all humanity, a principled
       revolutionary and a true comrade.''; and


  (5) salutes Steve Tshwete for the immeasurable contribution he made to
       the building of a democratic society and says farewell to one of our
       country's greatest heroes as we seek to emulate the values of
       service, discipline and commitment which Steve Tshwete embodied
       throughout his life.

  Le Ndlu ivakalisa uvelwano olunzulu kuNkosikazi Pam Tshwete, kuMayihlome,
  kuYonda, kuLindela, kuMandlakazi nakubo bonke ooThangana, amaZangwa
  nezalamane.
Phumla ngoxolo Krila, qhawe lamaqhawe. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs
follows.)

[This House extends its deep condolences to Mrs Pam Tshwete, Mayihlome,
Yonda, Lindela and Mandlakazi, and the whole of the Thanganas, the Zangwas
and their relatives.


Rest in peace Krila, hero of heroes.]
[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, many lavish tributes have been paid to the
late Steve Tshwete over the past days at memorial services and at his
funeral. It is entirely appropriate that this House, where he loomed so
large, should likewise have an opportunity of marking his passing.

While he was with us, no one could ignore Steve's presence. He had quite a
remarkable popularity with members of this House, particularly of his own
party. Who could forget the full-throated roar of ``Steve!'' as he entered
or left this Chamber on occasion?
I am one of those who crossed swords with him on many occasions. It is my
job to do that, and I do not withdraw a single comment I made about him or
about his efforts. What I am doing, however, is to point out that we
differed as South Africans, as patriots and as friends. Even when Steve
went head-to-head against his opponents, he maintained perspective and
there was no hatred or continued ill will.

We had many laughs. I think of the time he came in wearing a shirt which I
described as his pyjamas. He glared at me, sent daggers across the floor
but, a few minutes later, I saw his stomach going up and down as he
laughed.

There were many times we had laughs. Members may recall that he often came
in wearing dark glasses. I think he thought that he looked menacing when he
came in like that! [Laughter.] A few months ago I acquired some dark
glasses and did the same: every time Steve put his glasses on, I also did
the same. What we did was to sit and look at each other like two Papa Doc
Duvaliers! [Laughter.]
The National Assembly will miss the hon Steve. He was a larger-than-life
figure and a real character. The DA joins in expressing our sincere
condolences to all of those who loved him.

Hamba kahle, Steve. [Go well, Steve.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Madam Speaker, I rise to join my
colleagues, in this sombre and sad moment for this House, to relay a
message of condolence on behalf of the IFP, firstly to the family and close
relatives of the late Minister Tshwete; secondly to his political family,
the ANC and the alliance; thirdly, to the President, whose Minister this
was, as well as to all his colleagues in the executive; and fourthly, to
you, Madam Speaker, as you preside over the House whose member he was.

South Africa has been deprived of a dedicated servant of the people.
Younger members of this House have been robbed by death of a role model to
emulate. He was propelled by the exemplary spirit of patriotism, which put
his people and the interest of his country first, rather than self.

The shocking news of his death gripped the whole country and left both
friend and foe stunned by the untimely passing on of this zestful Minister.
It will, indeed, take a while before we all get over his death.

The untimely death of Minister Tshwete brings to the fore the fragility of
life and, indeed, our own immortality. It was for this reason that the
sages and prophets of old, pondering over the shortness of human life,
said:


  You sweep men away in the sleep of death; they are like the new grass of
  the morning - though in the morning it springs up new, by evening it is
  dry and withered ...


  The length of our days is 70 years - or 80, if we have the strength; yet
  their span is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass and we fly
  away.
Steven Vukile Tshwete has gone to rest from his labours. May he rest in
peace in the company of the vast throngs of Africa's heroes and heroines
who have gone before him. May he rest in peace and take his rightful place
among other fighters for liberation and freedom of all the children of
Mother Africa. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the New NP it is my honour
to pay tribute to the late Steve Tshwete. We salute Steve Tshwete as a
parliamentarian par excellence. When he spoke in a debate, he always went
for the kill - with or without good arguments. But most remarkably, he
never allowed the ferociousness of a debate to turn into personal grudges.
After every heated exchange or argument, he always remained ``Mr Nice
Guy''.

We salute him as a Minister of Safety and Security who made a difference in
our combat against crime by declaring war on criminals. During his term of
office, criminals indeed became personae non grata in this country.
We also salute him as a politician who went out of his way to break down
the political racial divide in South African politics.

Toe wyle dr J S Gericke 'n bekende Afrikanerleier begrawe het, het hy hom
vergelyk met 'n seder wat geval het in Libanon. Met Steve Tshwete se dood
kan inderdaad gesê word dat 'n seder geval het in Suid-Afrika. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[When the late Dr J S Gericke laid to rest a well-known Afrikaner leader,
he compared him with a cedar falling in Lebanon. With the passing of Steve
Tshwete it can truly be said that a cedar has, fallen in South Africa.]

We convey our condolences to his wife and children, who lost a beloved
husband and father; to the ANC, who lost a true stalwart; and to the
Cabinet, who lost a valuable member. South Africa will be much poorer
without the services of Steve Tshwete. [Applause.]

Njing L M MBADI: Somlomo, Sekela Mongameli, abaphathiswa noogxa bam,
ndivumeleni nam ndiphose igade, ndigxwale emswaneni egameni lombutho i-UDM.

Ngomhla wama-26 kuTshazimpuzi kuwo lo nyaka, libonakele izulu lithe
gubungxu, libonakalisa ukuba kukho udaba lokunduluka kwendoda enkulu,
indoda yamadoda, uThangana, uKrila, uMbamba. Thina ke baziyo asixelelwanga
mntu, sizibonele ngemozulu ukuba ukho undonakele, kukho ukuhlanganiswa
kwabaphilayo nabangasekhoyo, nguSteve Vukile Tshwete.

Lo mfo ebesaziwa emaphandleni, ezidolophini nakumaziko emfundo. Igalelo
nefuthe lakhe belitsho abafundi bagonyamele impatheko-mbi ezikolweni
eziphantsi kolawulo lwabacinezeli noongcothoza babo abamnyama. Le nto
yakhokhelela ekwahlukeni phakathi kwabafundi, abefuthe lika Thangana nabe
nkqubo eyayilawula ngelo xesha. Emaphandleni nasezidolophini, ngakumbi
ngexesha likaSebe, ifuthe lakhe latsho watshabha umbuso kaSebe, kwakhalwa
ngoThangana, hayi uNgwe yeSizwe.

Ubashiyile ooBantu, ooMarthinus nooTony, amadoda ebejongana nawo
ngezikhondo zamehlo, de maxa wambi akhombe ngomnwe, emunca iintupha ngathi
uthi `inene, ndiza kunifumana.' Uhambile ke uThangana Masibuye ibuyambo,
sithathele kuye sakhe inkululeko eyiyo, inxaxheba yesininzi, ukuze
isizukulwana singasiqalekisi sithi: `oomama nootata ePalamente ibizizanya-
mtya, abasishiyanga nambele ubhongxileyo ukwanyisa usapho loMzantsi
Afrika.' Ewe kuba njalo ke kakade kwakuhamba igorha lamagorha, ikroti
lamakroti, ebelingaceli ndolalaphi mntwini.

Masilibulele ilifa uKrila asishiye nalo, ukunyaniseka nokuthembeka.
Alahlekelwe amapolisa nguThangana, imigulukudu ilila ngasonye, ithemba
kumafama amhlophe liphelile nentswahla ngoSteve iphelile ePalamente. Silila
nayo ke i-ANC neNdlu ngokubanzi. Kusapho lukaThangana sithi: Tutwini
maBamba. Akuhlanga lungehlanga. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa speech

[Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, hon ministers and my
colleagues, please allow me to say a few words on behalf of the UDM.
On 26 May this year the sky grew dark, indicating the passing away of the
great men of men, Thangana, Krila, Mbamba. Those of us who know these
things were not told by anyone but read the weather that something was
wrong; the event was about the meeting of the living together with the dead
by hon Steve Vukile Tshwete. This man was popular in the rural areas, in
big cities and towns, as well as in educational institutions. He sensitised
students who then would organise boycotts and strike actions against ill-
treatment at their schools, which were in the hands of white oppressors and
the black people that were considered their puppets. A split resulted
between students acting on the influence of Thangana and those who favoured
the government of that time. In rural areas and in cities, especially
during the reign of Sebe, his influence degraded Sebe's government, and
Thangana's name, and not Ngwe Yesizwe, became the popular name among the
disgruntled.

He has left behind the likes of Bantu, Marthinus and Tony, men with whom he
was always at loggerheads to the extent that he would sometimes point his
fingers at them and lick them, as if he was saying, `I am really going to
get you'. Thangana is now gone. Let us get back together and take from the
legacy he has left behind to build our democracy, so that the next
generation will not denounce us and say: `Our mothers and fathers at
Parliament were stupid. They did not leave us, the new South African
generation, a full teat from which we could suck'. Yes, it is often like
that when a big man, a hero of heroes, the bravest of the brave, one who
never wanted favouritism, leaves.

Let us express our gratitude for the legacy of faithfulness, loyalty,
trustworthiness and credibility that Krila left us. The South African
Police Service has suffered a loss. Criminals are perhaps not sorry about
this. White farmers have most probably lost hope and hon Steve, as a source
of vibrant laughter in Parliament, is gone. We mourn with the ANC, as well
as the house. To the family of Thangana we say: We are very sorry for the
loss you have suffered, you of the Bamba family'. [Applause.]]
Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, we received the sad news about the
untimely death of the hon Minister Steve Tshwete with shock. He left us at
a time when it was generally believed that his fight against crime was
starting to bear fruit. His discipline, commitment and dynamic hands-on
approach made him the right man for the job. This also earned him respect
among those who were concerned about crime in general, and motivated the
police to do their best in apprehending criminals.

The ACDP salutes the late Steve Tshwete for the great contribution that he
made to the building of a new democratic South Africa and for his tireless
efforts to bring crime under control. We know that if he had his way, he
would have changed the Constitution in order to strengthen the hands of the
police in their fight against crime, as he expressed that wish on a few
occasions.

We will also remember him for his tough and fearless approach in dealing
with crime syndicates and regret that he left us before he could see the
fruits of his tireless labour.
The ACDP extend their deepest condolences to his wife, his three children,
his relatives, his parliamentary colleagues and his friends. May they take
comfort and strength from the words of the Apostle Paul, who said, and I
quote:


  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or
  distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?


  Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved
  us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor
  principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor
  height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate
  us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Tsamaya hantle, Ntate Tshwete! [Go well, Mr Tshwete!] [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, Mr Tshwete was born in Springs on 12
November 1938. He was the eldest of five children. He attended various
schools in the Eastern Cape and was, in his final year, head prefect. He
played first-team rugby. I think all these already showed his leadership
qualities at that stage.

Mr Tshwete became involved in politics while at school and joined the ANC.
At the 1991 ANC congress in Durban he was elected to its National Executive
Committee. He became Minister of Sport in 1994, and we all came to know him
in this Chamber as the Minister of Safety and Security.

Die VF het minister Tshwete leer ken as 'n gedugte politieke opponent in
hierdie Huis. Maar ons het graag met hom swaarde gekruis omdat hy nie bang
was om feit teen feit, argument teen argument te stel nie. Ons is wel op
rekord waar ons met hom saamgestem en hom ondersteun het in sy
oorlogverklaring teen misdaad.

In die mediaverklaring wat die VF direk ná minister Tshwete se dood
uitgereik het, het ons gestel dat die ANC hom moeilik sal kan vervang. Hy
was in werklikheid die ``Mr Fixit'' van die ANC wat verskillende ANC-
probleme en -krisisse telkens moes oplos en, by uitnemendheid, wel daarin
geslaag het om dit met die minste moontlike probleme reg te kry.

Die VF betuig graag by hierdie geleentheid simpatie met mev Thswete, die
hele Tshwete-familie, met hul groot verlies. Mag hulle troos ontvang.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The FF got to know Minister Tshwete as a formidable political opponent in
this House. But we enjoyed crossing swords with him, because he was not
afraid of counteracting fact with fact, argument with argument. We are, in
fact, on record as having agreed with and supported him in his declaration
of war on crime.

In the media statement which the FF released just after Minister Tshwete's
death we said that the ANC would have difficulty in replacing him. He was,
in truth, the ``Mr Fixit'' of the ANC, who time and again had to resolve
various ANC problems and succeeded excellently in doing so with the minimum
of problems.

On this occasion the FF would like to express its sympathy with Mrs
Tshwete, the whole Tshwete family, on their great loss. May they receive
consolation. [Applause.]]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, the UCDP wishes to express its sincere
condolence to the family of the late Minister of Safety and Security, Mr
Steve Tshwete. Our hearts and minds are with his family at this moment of
their bereavement.

Mr Tshwete was not called ``Mr Fixit'' for nothing. When he inherited the
Department of Safety and Security that was characterised by inefficiency,
with a demotivated police force, he turned it around.

The level of crime in this country was, by and large, described in
astronomical statistics, but he managed to reduce it to a manageable level
as it is today. For example, today central Johannesburg is one of the
safest places in South Africa.

At the parliamentary level, Mr Tshwete was not full of humour, but exuded
confidence, unquenchable passion and unquestioned love for his country, and
he was always ready to defend and stand by whatever he believed to be
right. To ordinary citizens, he was beginning to be seen as a unifying
figure for South Africans. As a people's Minister of the most important and
challenging portfolio of Safety and Security in the history of South
Africa, he was the kind of person who would say sorry, if need be, without
feeling belittled. Indeed, he was a firebrand in Parliament.

Surely Thangana will be missed by friends and foes alike, because he was
honest and had a mind of his own. He gave praise and credit even to his
ardent opponent, if he deserved it.

To this end, while he was Minister of Sport and Recreation, he openly
credited Kgosi L M Mangope for all he did in providing sports
infrastructure, something, I think, that some of his colleagues in
Government and the party would not have done.

How can we easily forget a person of Mr Tshwete's stature, who was larger
than life? He loved what he was doing, not as a career, but as a calling to
eradicate crime in this country. We are challenged as South Africans to
preserve his legacy and to continue to fight where he left off to make
South Africa a safe haven for everyone.

Lala ka kgotso, Thangana [Rest in peace, Thangana.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, on the occasion of the death of Julius
Caesar, Mark Anthony said:


  I came to bury Caesar, not to praise him
  The evil that men do lives after them,
  The good is often interred with their bones, so let it be with Caesar.

On behalf of the PAC, I rise to say I come to praise Steve Tshwete, not to
bury him. The good he did will not be interred with his bones. The PAC
salutes him for the role he played in the liberation struggle.

We in the PAC never agreed with some fundamental policies of his party,
amongst which were the imprisonment of our former Apla forces, while
apartheid criminals had amnesty; privatisation of state assets and land
claims from 1913. We ran many political battles with him over the eviction
of our people from Bredell in the midst of a severely cold winter. He was
angry with us when the masses in Bredell chased him away. He threatened to
arrest PAC leaders.

Another occasion on which we clashed with Comrade Steve Tshwete was when we
buried Sibusiso Madubela and gave him a 21-gun salute. All hell broke loose
when Madubela's coffin was lowered and bullets flew in the air. The PAC
will miss him. He was dedicated to his cause.

Yes, he did his best on crime, but crime will never be eradicated as long
as criminals are treated as if their right to life is superior to that of
law-abiding citizens. Criminals are brutal and beastly in the country. They
must not be treated with kisses.

We convey our condolences to Mrs Tshwete and the family.

Tsamaya hantle, morwa wa Tshwete. [Go well, son of Tshwete.]

Usibulisele kuNjongantshiyini bath'uqumbile, iNkunz'abayikhuz'ukuhlaba
ingekahlabi, umxelele ukuthi inkululeko yethu ngomhlaba isagexa. [Pass our
regards to Njongantshiyini that they say is cross, the Bull that is feared
although it has not struck; tell him that our freedom regarding the land is
still shaky.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Mevrou die Speaker, hiermee wil ek graag namens die FA,
en veral Dr Luyt, simpatie betuig met familie en vriende, na die afsterwe
van Steve Tshwete. Ek het hom in die Kabinet as 'n kollega leer ken, as 'n
mens-mens sonder enige fieterjasies, as iemand wat reguit met 'n mens kon
praat. Deur sy persoonlikheid en sy menswees het hy baie bygedra tot die
skep van omstandighede waar baie Suid-Afrikaners saam oor die brug na die
nuwe Suid-Afrika kon beweeg. Daarom sal ek hom in daardie trant onthou.

Hy en Dr Luyt het ernstig swaarde gekruis, maar verder as 'n woorde-oorlog
het dit nie gevorder nie. So het Steve gelewe en so sal ons hom onthou.
Daarom sal ons hom in die toekoms mis op die pad wat ons nog saam moet loop
en waarvan hy 'n baie belangrike fondament vir ons almal gelê het. Ons eer
sy nagedagtenis. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the FA, and Dr Luyt in
particular, I would like to express sympathy towards family and friends on
the death of Steve Tshwete. I came to know him in the Cabinet as a
colleague, as a people person without any whims, as someone who could speak
frankly to one. Through his personality and his humanity he contributed
much to the creation of conditions in which many South Africans could cross
the bridge together to the new South Africa. For this reason I shall
remember him in that way.

He and Dr Luyt crossed swords seriously, but it never became more than a
war of words. This is the way Steve lived, and this is the way we shall
remember him. For this reason we shall miss him in future on the road which
we still have to travel together and on which he laid a very important
foundation for all of us. We honour his memory. [Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the MF leader, Mr Rajbansi,
councillors and myself, I take this opportunity to extend condolences on
the loss of the hon Minister Steve Tshwete.

A freedom fighter left us on the eve of our freedom. He fought for freedom,
but did not live to enjoy it. I have known the late Steve Tshwete for
approximately two and a half years. His strong character, his reputation as
a comrade in the struggle and his contribution as a dedicated and
determined member of the national Government had earned him status and
recognition. As commemorated, the late Steve Tshwete will be remembered as
the son of the soil who led the fight against crime and apartheid with
distinction.

His inspiring work and commitment were rooted as early as the 60s, pledging
his commitment and dedication to his work with people and bodies such as
the MK and the ANC. His hard work and sacrifices are footprints left over
15 years of imprisonment on Robben Island as a political prisoner. He was
exiled to Lusaka soon thereafter, were he persisted in his commitment to
the struggle. He returned to South Africa a few years later and, united in
our success, we walked into the new Government.

Steve Tshwete was a strong force against apartheid. He had always been a
strong force in instituting a new South Africa and was a great contributor
to the success of this country.

His charisma shall live on as an inspiration. His work at national level
has been remarkable, and the MF grieves the loss of such a dedicated and
committed force who worked hard for the betterment of South Africa and
South Africans.

The MF grieves the loss suffered by his wife and children, and may God give
them strength to overcome this difficult time. Condolences are also
conveyed to the ANC and the national Government of South Africa.

We have lost a husband, a father and a great, courageous comrade. May his
soul rest in peace.

Hamba kahle, Steve. [Go well, Steve.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, much has been said today about the political
achievements of the late Steve Tshwete. In this short tribute which I
present on behalf of the AEB, I want to highlight the two most outstanding
features of the man, Steve Tshwete, that personally impressed me most.

Firstly, I want to talk about his uniqueness, his own individual Tshwete-
like approach which was comparable to no other person that I know. His
hoarse voice was unique. The way in which he pointed his bent finger to the
opposition was unique. I remember the one day when he replied to an
unwelcome remark from this side of the House with a gesture which I now
illustrate. [Laughter.] His interjections were unique. He made his presence
felt whenever he entered a room. If there was one man in this House who
could say ``I did it my way'', it was Steve Tshwete. Nobody else would be
able to imitate that.

The second feature, and maybe the one good characteristic of Steve Tshwete
that often brought him trouble, was his absolute honesty - he spoke his
mind. Quite often he was politically incorrect and impulsive. He was the
Minister who, more than anyone else, had had to say: ``Madam Speaker, I
withdraw'', even with regard to some public statements that he made. With
him, it was a case of what you see is what you get; no false facade; no
window dressing; and no hidden agenda. He never played for the pavilion and
he was always in the rucks and mauls of South African politics.

We experienced his true-hearted honesty when he so often visited the scene
of a crime, and when he was amongst the foot soldiers of our own policemen
and women who held him in high esteem. We experienced it when he, like a
father with genuine compassion, embraced Mr Moek van Rensburg, whose son
had been murdered on a farm the previous day. I experienced it whenever I
was involved in personal conversation with him. Maybe he was an example of
what we need most in South Africa today: integrity. Whatever he said, one
thing of which one could be sure was that he honestly meant what he said.
In a world of falseness, opportunism and cheap point-scoring, and in a
country with complicated social and political interactions, we need more
leaders like Steve Tshwete: honest, straightforward and sincere.

The office of Steve Tshwete may be replaced but the person may never be
replaced. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, Azapo wishes to convey its deepest-felt
condolences to the wife, children and relatives of Comrade Steven Vukile
Tshwete. At this moment of sadness, Azapo joins the ANC and all comrades
across the liberation spectrum to celebrate his contribution to the
struggle to free our people.

Indeed, his struggle was the people's struggle. Little by little, the human
contributions of Comrade Steve Vukile Tshwete will begin to fade away. His
strong opinions, the nature of his imposing gestures, his somewhat hoarse
voice and his strong belief in eradicating crime - which won him the hearts
and minds of policemen and women - all of these attributes will start to
fade away.

We remember him for his intellectual capacity and, above all, his
friendliness which won him over the hearts of even his very dear former
enemies. We who lived with Steve on Robben Island will remember him for his
strong political arguments and his strong views about the liberation
struggle. May his spirit live on! Hamba kahle, Tshwete! [Go well, Tshwete!]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members, over a
week ago, the nation received traumatic news of the passing on of hon Steve
Tshwete, the Minister of Safety and Security and member of this House. As
for many of us in the ANC and among the people of South Africa, the death
of Comrade Steve left us in a state of despair and sudden confusion. This
was the case because, in our minds, this vociferous giant had steadily but
surely led the men and women in uniform in the battle against crime, and
was working hard to build communities where ordinary South Africans will
live in a peaceful and secure environment. Comrade Steve Tshwete was a
patriot - a revolutionary who demonstrated unwavering commitment to the
liberation of the people of South Africa.

He was born of peasant parents in Peelton in 1938. During his youthful
years he developed a political consciousness which led him to join the ANC,
and he was described by the President as: ithambo lenyoka elihlaba
elimzondayo [he who could pick out the undesirables.] he immersed himself
in the work of the ANC. He was arrested in 1963 and spent 15 years in jail.
He was released in 1978 and soon played an important role in building civic
and political organisations in the then border region of the Eastern Cape.
He was later elected president of the border region of the United
Democratic Front. The apartheid government declared him an illegal
immigrant in the country of his birth. Like many South Africans, his house
was turned into a jail. He later fled the country and joined the ANC in
exile.

He joined Umkhonto we Sizwe and was appointed the national commissar of the
army. During his term of office, he inspired many cadres who were sent on
missions to fight inside the country. Being the gallant warrior that he
was, no task was too difficult for him. He was never paralysed by fear. He
was a general who led from the front. Amongst the many deeds of heroism
that he was involved in, one that will last forever in my memory is when,
on 12 May 1988, the unit he was with was ambushed in Angola by Savimbi. In
that battle, when the commander - Bra T - was injured, Comrade Steve
Tshwete took over command. It is appropriate, therefore, at this stage, to
take the opportunity to lower the banner on behalf of all former Umkhonto
we Sizwe combatants to pay tribute to this gallant warrior of our soil.

When the ANC was unbanned, he was charged with the responsibility of
rebuilding the ANC structures in the country. This laid the firm basis for
the landslide victory of the ANC in the first democratic elections. He then
became instrumental in the transformation of sport codes in South Africa
and the return to the international arena. At the time of his death,
Comrade Steve was the Minister of Safety and Security.

On Saturday, 4 May we gathered at Bisho Stadium to say farewell to this
great lion of the south. As the President put it, and I quote him:


  It is not our part to mourn. It is our right and privilege to celebrate
  the fact that we were blessed with so rare a gift of a fellow South
  African who was simultaneously a genuine friend, a trustworthy colleague,
  an activist, a leader, a patriot, an internationalist, a human titan who
  surrendered his life to the cause of all humanity, a principled
  revolutionary and a true comrade.

One of the key personal attributes that Comrade Steve had was a rare gift
of being humane and firm at the same time, always willing and ready to
forgive, and equally ready to humble himself and apologise whenever he
erred. He was an able storyteller, an orator, and he was endowed with a
sense of humour and remained thus up until his last days, even on his
deathbed. These virtues defined Thangana.

As we celebrate the life achievements of Comrade Steve, we must ask
ourselves the question: What is it that we must do to ensure that death
hath no sting? What is it that we need to do individually and collectively
to ensure that the grave that death bequeaths unto us cannot conquer the
immortal spirit of an outstanding combatant for freedom?

The late Tshwete was part of a collective; a Government and an organisation
- the ANC - that have laid the firm basis for national unity and national
reconciliation; a collective that is engaged in programmes to roll back the
frontiers of poverty and build a better life for all; a collective engaged
in the struggle to build a nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South
Africa. Comrade Steve Tshwete has been about achieving these noble
objectives.

Kwikhaya lakwaThangana, ooKrila sithi: Lalani ngenxeba. Akuhlanga
lungehlanga kuqabane uPam Tshwete, unkosikazi wakhe, nabantwana
uYondangebhulu, uMayihlome-ihlasele, uLindela noMandlakazi. Sivakalisa
uvelwano olunzulu.

Phumla ngoxolo Thangana, Krila, Mbamba, Raso, Qhawe lamaqhawe esizweni.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[To the Thangana family, the Krilas, we say: We express our heartfelt
sympathies to comrade Pam Tshwete, his wife and children, Yondangebhulu,
Mayihlome-ihlasele, Lindela and Mandlakazi. We extend our deep condolences.

Rest in peace, Thanga, Krila, Mbamba, Rhaso, hero of heroes of our country.
[Applause.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, the Deputy Speaker and I wish to associate
ourselves with the sentiments that have been expressed. We will convey
these to the late member's family. You have been unanimous in your views.

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to, all members standing.

         APPOINTMENT OF MR G Q M DOIDGE AS CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Chief Whip of the Majority
Party, I move the draft resolution printed in her name on the Order Paper,
as follows:


  That the House appoints Mr G Q M Doidge as Chairperson of Committees to
  replace Mr M J Mahlangu, who resigned from the post with effect from 7
  May 2002.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, the DP is in full support of this motion
and would like to second it. Would it be appropriate to speak now or
hereafter?

The SPEAKER: I think you may speak now, and then we will formally adopt the
motion.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I am not sure whether anybody can hear me,
because I am told that the microphones are not working.

The SPEAKER: They are very selective! Continue.

Mr D H M GIBSON: The DP has pleasure in seconding the motion for the
appointment of the hon Geoff Doidge as Chairperson of Committees. Mr Doidge
has proved his capabilities as a first-grade parliamentarian. He is very
committed to his party, his constituency and his family. He now has an
opportunity of serving Parliament as a whole in this senior position.

My party knows him as a hard worker, as well as an intelligent and well-
organised man. He maintains good relationships across party lines. We
expect that he will preside with fairness and impartiality, and he
certainly has our support.

I would like to say, in conclusion, that we on this side would like to pay
tribute to the hon M J Mahlangu, Mr Doidge's immediate predecessor. Mr M J
Mahlangu was an extremely able presiding officer. He presided with
competence, dignity and quiet charm. We are grateful to him for his service
as chairperson, and wish him well in his further career. I second.
[Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I have had the pleasure, for the past one and
a half years, of working with a great gentleman and selfless colleague, the
hon M J Mahlangu.

I wish him well as he leaves his present post to assume the very important
and newly created post of chairperson of the Budget committee. I thank this
colleague for his positive leadership, particularly for the generous spirit
of accommodation he always manifested.

The arrival of Mr Geoff Doidge in the newly vacated post means that one
gentleman has handed the baton to yet another gentleman. The hon Doidge is
a senior colleague who has shown himself in all circumstances to be
unflappable, friendly and very fair-minded. I wish to welcome the hon Geoff
Doidge and extend to him all my co-operation.

He has the mettle and the vision to continue with the groundwork undertaken
by his colleagues, and to help further develop the all-important committee
system of which we are all justifiably proud.

Welcome once again and, on behalf of the IFP, the sincerest congratulations
to him on the assumption of this most important position. [Applause.]

Mnr C H F GREYLING: Mevrou die Speaker, die Nuwe NP vereenselwig hom met
die mosie soos dit op die Ordelys verskyn. Ek wil graag namens ons party
vir mnr Doidge baie gelukwens met sy nuwe aanstelling as Voorsitter van
Komitees. Gedurende sy tydperk as Ajunkhoofsweep het ons hom leer ken in
die hoofswepeforum, as 'n persoon wat sy werk met bekwaamheid en met
doeltreffendheid uitgevoer het. Hy het altyd 'n oopdeurbeleid gevolg. Ons
glo dat die nuwe Voorsitter van Komitees ook in hierdie nuwe hoedanigheid
'n sukses sal maak van die nuwe taak wat nou aan hom opgedra is.

Ons wens hom graag sterkte en voorspoed toe, en vertrou dat hy as
voorsitter te alle tye onpartydig en regverdig sal optree, en dat hy die
komiteestelsel soos 'n geoliede masjien sal laat loop. (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, the New NP associates itself with the
motion as it appears on the Order Paper. I wish to convey, on behalf of our
party, our heartiest congratulations to Mr Doidge on his new appointment as
Chairperson of Committees. During his term of office as Deputy Chief Whip
we got to know him, in the Chief Whips' forum, as someone who performed his
task with competence and efficiency. He always practised an open-door
policy. We believe that the new Chairperson of Committees will also, in
this new capacity, make a success of the new task that has now been
entrusted to him.

We wish him all the best and trust that, as chairperson, he will act
impartially and fairly at all times and that he will keep the committee
functioning like a well-oiled engine.]

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker, the hon Mr Doidge has served as a whip in
the new democratic Parliament since 1994. During this time he has served
under four different chief whips. He therefore has a rich and diverse
experience of the workings of Parliament.

He has proven himself as a person who tackles small and big challenges with
equal vigour and enthusiasm, which has translated into many success
stories. We do believe that he will take these qualities and this
experience with him into his new post, and will thereby contribute to the
proper functioning of Parliament.

Mr Doidge's elevation to the position of Chairperson of Committees is due
recognition for his commitment to this institution. The UDM supports the
motion and wishes him well in his endeavours. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek wil graag namens die VF die
geleentheid gebruik om Mnr Doidge baie hartlik geluk te wens. Ons het hom
leer ken as 'n baie bekwame persoon wat waargeneem het by verskeie
geleenthede in die voorsitterstoel in die hoofswepevergadering. Ons vertrou
dat hy, soos wat hy daar sterk kon optree en kon standpunt inneem, dit ook
sal doen in die Raad in sy nuwe hoedanigheid.

Hierdie is 'n baie harde plek. 'n Mens moet 'n aanstelling kry, of iets
anders moet met jou gebeur, voordat mense van jou mooi dinge sê. So ek wil
vir Mnr Doidge baie hartlik gelukwens. Ons sal graag met hom saamwerk.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity on
behalf of the FF to heartily congratulate Mr Doidge. We have come to know
him as a very competent person who has acted as chair on several occasions
in the chief whips' meetings. We trust that, just as he acted firmly and
took a firm stand on those occasions, he will also do so in his new
capacity in the House.

This is a very tough place. One has to secure an appointment, or something
else must happen to one, before people say nice things about one. So I
would like to heartily congratulate Mr Doidge. We would like to co-operate
with him. [Applause.]]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, we would like to congratulate Mr
Mahlangu. We are definitely going to miss him when he takes up his new
position. However, we know that he is going to do a great job in this new
portfolio.
With regard to Mr Doidge, I have come to know him for only a short time,
but it has been very good knowing him. He has been very fair-minded and
easy to talk to, and the opposition parties knew that they could come to
him, especially the minority parties. So we want to congratulate him on his
new portfolio.

I can tell him that we already have complaints lined up for him with
reference to the committee, so he will be hearing from the ACDP. We once
again want to congratulate him. We will miss him as the Deputy Chief Whip,
though, but we know that he will be a success in this new portfolio.
[Applause.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mevrou die Speaker, van ons kant af wil ons ook vir Mnr
Doidge baie gelukwens. In die kort tydjie wat ek hom leer ken het, het ek
hom ervaar as 'n man wat baie opreg is in sy werk, en baie eerlik sy werk
doen. Ek dink hy gaan 'n uitstekende voorsitter wees, en ons wens hom 'n
oop pad vorentoe toe. Van ons kant af sal hy al die steun kry wat hy nodig
het. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, for our part, we would also like to
congratulate Mr Doidge. In the short time that I have come to know him, I
have found him to be a man who is very sincere in his work and who performs
his work with great honesty. I think he will be an excellent chairperson,
and we wish him an open road ahead. He will receive all the support that he
requires from our side.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, we would like to wish Mr Doidge well and
congratulate him as he takes up this new position. He has proven himself to
be a very fair-minded and balanced person as a Deputy Chief Whip, and we
can only hope that even as Chairperson of Committees he will keep on
serving us well.

We would like to thank Mr Mahlangu, the gentle giant who presided over this
House for some time. We hope that even in his new post we will keep on
enjoying his co-operation. We shall meet there, as some of us belong to
that committee. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF wishes to associate itself with the
others in congratulating the hon Doidge on his new position. But there is
one thing I would like to remind Deputy Chief Whip Doidge, and that is that
... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Please proceed, hon member.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Nevertheless, I congratulate him on his new post.
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, die AEB wil ook graag vir mnr Jeoff
Doidge hartlik gelukwens met sy nuwe aanstelling. Ek dink hy het homself
bewys in die tyd toe hy as waarnemende hoofsweep dinge baie goed gehanteer
het. Mnr Doidge het aan my 'n belofte gemaak, en dit is dat ons voortaan
baie meer Afrikaans gaan hoor daar van die voorste podium af. Ek hoop hy
hou daarby. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the AEB would also like to sincerely
congratulate Mr Jeoff Doidge on his new appointment. I think he proved
himself during the time when, as Chief Whip, he handled things very well.
Mr Doidge made me a promise, and that is that in future we are going to
hear much more Afrikaans from the foremost podium in front. I hope he keeps
to that.]

I just want to ask a question: With the upcoming crossing of floors in
mind, will Mr Doidge still keep his new post in September when he crosses
over to the new AEB? [Laughter.]

I also want to thank Mr Mahlangu for the way in which he handled the
proceedings of this House. I hope Mr Doidge will not be so punctual on the
red button when dealing with two-minute speeches!

Agreed to.

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Doidge, your colleagues have congratulated you and I
also add my congratulations. But I must add a slight word of sympathy: you
are very well aware that this is not an enviable job. Your predecessor has
carried it with great fortitude and distinction. You will do well to follow
in his footsteps. I congratulate you. [Applause.]

I also want to thank Mr Mahlangu for the very hard work that he and his
deputy have put into this office. [Applause.]

Mr Doidge, you may address the House.

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, I just want to say to Cassie that I do not
think there is any space in the lift for another member, because that is
the only caucus room I think he knows. [Laughter.] That is the only one
with a mirror, Cassie.

Let me begin by, firstly, thanking the ANC organisation, for having
bestowed this honour and privilege on me, and for having shown such
confidence in me. Mr Frolick is correct: this is the fourth Chief Whip that
I have served under. I was hoping that by the time we got to the podium
this afternoon, I would have been given the privilege of breaking the
record by having Chief Whip number five, but I was not that fortunate.
I have served in this Parliament under the guidance of Rev Makhenkesi
Stofile, Comrade Max Sisulu, Comrade Tony Yengeni and, recently, under the
hon Maphisa Nqakula. Working as part of the ANC team of whips has sustained
and nurtured me. I want to thank all the ANC whips for the support that
they have given me over the years, and pledge that my door will be opened
to them. To the chief whips of other parties, I must express my gratitude
for their co-operation, which ensured that the work of Parliament proceeded
smoothly and efficiently. However, I must warn them that I am not as
generous as they think I am!

I must also pay special tribute to Comrade M J Mahlangu, who vacates the
Chair that I will now be filling. I trust that, in his new position, he
will be able and will continue to make a further contribution to the
transformation and smooth running of Parliament. His measured, calm and
rational approach in times of pressure and stress are qualities that we
should all emulate.

To my successor, the hon Nel, I wish him every success. I also want to
thank the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, who have over the years given me
much support and an opportunity to gain a better insight. I am looking
forward to working with all the staff here in Parliament and the presiding
officers, as we continue to make our contribution towards the
transformation of this institution.

Lastly, I want to bid farewell - and it is with a heavy heart that I do so
- to our outgoing Chief Whip, the new Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, the
hon Maphisa Nqakula, with whom I have been privileged to work for a very
short time. It has been an exciting time and I was probably one of the most
disappointed people, because I could see the vision and mission that she
had come with to this Parliament. Our time together was short but exciting,
and her legacy in Parliament will survive her departure to higher office.

In conclusion, I stand here today as a servant of the people. This House
represents the voice of those people and as an officer of this House, I
pledge to serve the people of our nation as fully as I am able to.
[Applause.]

         CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW COMMITTEE

Report adopted without debate.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, could we have some order in the
House, so that we can hear the hon the Minister. Those hon members that are
moving out, it would be appreciated if you could do so very quietly.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 26 - Communications:

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, colleagues
in the executive, members of the Portfolio Committee on Communications in
particular, hon members of Parliament, distinguished guests, allow me to
start off my debate this afternoon by paying tribute to a son of Africa, a
warrior that fell on 26 April. I do not doubt that all members of this
House will agree with me that a dark cloud did fall over South Africa that
Friday.

Comrade Steve will be remembered by all of us not just for his fierce
stance in this House in supporting what he believed in, but also for his
bravery in fighting for the freedom that is enjoyed by all South Africans
today, and mostly for his sterling work during the last two and a half
years of his life as Minister of Safety and Security.

Personally, his encouragement and confidence in me, and his belief that one
can rise to a challenge, whilst we were in exile in Lusaka, will always be
appreciated.

UQabane uSteve uyibekile induku ebandla. [Comrade Steve has played a major
role in society.]

On a different note, I would also like to take this opportunity to
congratulate two colleagues and comrades who have been faithful to the
struggle for a better South Africa, Comrades Nosiviwe and Charles Nqakula.
We have no doubt about their capabilities, and that they will bring to
their new posts, indeed, something that all of us will appreciate.

Today marks the end of an era and heralds an exciting future. We are
closing one door and opening another. Five years ago, we started a process
of transforming the telecommunications sector, focusing on access,
universal service and the modernisation of the sector. I am proud to report
to the House that, in this sector, we have made significant progress
towards ensuring universal access to services by all South Africans, and
advancement in the technological area.

We live in a world and a country that continues to be marked by gross
inequalities. Poverty alleviation therefore remains at the top of our
agenda. Information and communications technologies have been identified as
being central to development, both in our country and across the African
continent, as they present us with an opportunity to leapfrog decades of
development. Because of the importance attached to this sector and because
of its cross-cutting nature, special focus needs to be placed on the effort
to bridge the digital and knowledge divide.

Members will recall that a decision was taken to grant exclusivity to
Telkom five years ago. This entity was required to fulfil specific
obligations to roll out telephones in underserviced areas and villages as
well as to priority customers such as schools and hospitals. Telkom was
required to modernise and grow the telecommunications industry. In doing
this, Telkom has had to manage staff numbers in a necessary but painful
process.

This day heralds a new beginning, the birth of managed liberalisation. As
we stand poised to enter this new phase, I am proud to report to the House
that Telkom has made considerable progress in meeting the above
obligations, and more South Africans now have access to a range of new
services.

Five years ago, it was commonplace for the majority of South Africans to
cross rivers, catch buses, trains, and so on, to just be able to make a
telephone call. These South Africans, who constituted the majority, were,
in the main, falling outside any meaningful communication infrastructure
and services. For them, the luxury of having any connectivity within easy
reach, something that many of us take for granted, was a pipe dream.

I personally experienced this digital divide between rural and urban South
Africa very recently. I attempting to reach my director-general, who was
attending a family funeral in a village in the Eastern Cape. I was in
Pretoria. He had to travel for two hours to the nearest hilltop so that he
could get a signal and retrieve messages from his cellphone in order to
communicate with the seat of government. At one point he had to travel for
two hours to receive an urgent fax. For many, these conditions have
changed, but just as many are waiting to have such a change.

Over 2,5 million new lines have been installed since 1997, 1,4 million of
which were installed in historically underserviced areas. Approximately 2
700 villages were connected for the first time. Almost 20 500 priority
customers have been connected. Where previously it was common for our
people to wait for years before having a telephone installed in their
homes, I am informed that the average time for installation of services has
been reduced significantly so that the installation of services within some
areas is done within 28 days and now stands at 97% for business and 95% for
residential customers.

At a capital cost of R50 billion spent primarily in expanding, upgrading
and modernising the network, Telkom has rehabilitated its network into a
fully digital system that is managed from the National Network Operation
Centre in Centurion, which I invite members to visit so that they can see
for themselves the state-of-the-art technology that exists in our country.

Yet, there are still challenges that we must all confront in order for us
to defend these gains and extend them to more South Africans. One of these
challenges is to reduce the cost of telephony in order to lower the
disconnection rate.

Another challenge that confronts us is to fight against cable theft and to
protect the infrastructure that has been deployed in our communities and
placed at our service. I specifically call upon our people to help us in
fighting criminality and vandalism directed at the communications
infrastructure.

I was informed this morning that the last connection for Telkom during this
exclusivity period was a school, the Matome Malatji School of Phalaborwa in
Limpopo Province, whose principal is Mr Mashego.

Through the wonders of technology, an unlikely celebrity was introduced to
South African television audiences last year. I would like to introduce to
this House Mr Dlakela.

Molo Mhlobo Wam! [Hello, my friend!] [Applause.]

In May 2001, we delivered a budget speech for the department under the
theme `Unity in action for change''. We undertook to work together with
other departments on a wide range of issues and programmes that were to be
implemented during the past financial year.

Today we report back on the progress and achievements that we have made
together with our partners, and also outline the direction that we intend
taking during this financial year and beyond.

Firstly, we are happy to report that policy and legislation targets set by
the department in the past financial year were met. The Telecommunications
Amendment Act was enacted in November last year, after extensive
consultation with local and international stakeholders. There was a vibrant
debate in this House, as was dramatically illustrated by the hon member
Suzanne Vos, who prepared two speeches - one for declining to vote for it
and the other in support of it. I am glad that she was able to support it.
The Postal Services Amendment Act, which seeks to clarify the mandate of
the postal regulator, became law also in November. The Electronic
Communications and Transactions Bill is currently before Parliament and has
been welcomed by industry, both locally and internationally.

The amendments to the Telecommunications Act have paved the way for the
introduction of the second national operator in which a 30% stake is
reserved for Esi-Tel and Transtel, and a 19% stake is reserved for black
and women's economic empowerment. I am pleased to report that Icasa
received 10 applications for the empowerment stake, three of which were
disqualified. The invitation to apply for the 51% stake will be issued
shortly. The department led a highly successful road show late last year to
popularise the new licence opportunity in Asia and Europe.

The amendments have also paved the way for the awarding of an international
and multimedia licence to Sentech. Draft Sentech licences have already been
issued for public comment by Icasa, and the final licences will shortly be
issued by Icasa.

Furthermore, the amendments to the Telecommunications Act provided for the
licensing of operators in underserviced areas with a teledensity of less
than 5%. The majority of these are in the Integrated Sustainable Rural
Development Strategy nodal points. The department held provincial workshops
to raise awareness amongst the relevant communities of opportunities for
telecommunications licences in these areas. This process will bring about
significant ownership and involvement in the communications sector by black
people and women in our country.

The work done by Icasa is fundamental to the realisation of the new policy
and legislative objectives. Icasa has had to draft new regulations and
embark on licensing processes and public hearings. All of this work has
been done in a context of demanding deadlines and a high staff turnover as
a result of industry poaching.

Finally, the amendments provide for a new public emergency telephone and a
new emergency number - 112. A pilot has already been established in
Klerksdorp in the North West province.

As indicated earlier, the Electronic Transactions and Communications Bill
has been welcomed by local and international stakeholders alike. There are,
however, issues of a technical nature that have been raised, and these will
be attended to. And once the Bill has been passed, we will set up the
following: a cyber inspectorate to protect citizens against cyber crime, a
route certification authority for registration and certification of
operators in the cyber environment and a section 21 company for a country
code top level domain name registry.

As all members are aware, provisions for the continued existence of the
Universal Service Agency were contained in the Telecommunications Amendment
Act. The process to restructure the agency, including the establishment of
the board, is under way. In the course of last year, the agency conducted a
review of the work of the existing 90 telecentres that have been
established in the country. As a result of this review, a process will be
initiated during this year to upgrade the capacity of telecentres and
cyberlabs, as well as to redirect their activities to include training and
to provide dedicated services, especially to the youth.

During the past financial year, 30 schools in the nodal points were
equipped with modern communication tools as part of the extension of
services, in partnership with provincial education departments. This year,
200 additional schools will receive modern ICT tools as part of the Edunet
network to link up all public schools. And in addition, the agency will
finalise a universal service map to guide operators during the process of
redrafting the universal service obligations later this year.

Regarding broadcasting, during the course of the last financial year an
additional 1,5 million South Africans gained access either to radio
services for the first time or to improved radio services in accordance
with our promise to advance universal service in broadcasting. In July last
year, we had the privilege of switching on the Mbuzini transmitter to
extend Radio Ligwalagwala to 400 000 new listeners in Schoemansdal,
Mpumalanga, who until then had never had an FM signal.

In December last year, UKhozi radio service reached 695 000 new listeners
at Qhudeni, KwaZulu-Natal. During the same month 435 000 new listeners in
Kwaggafontein, Mpumalanga tuned in to Thobela FM and Ikwekwezi for the
first time. The same extension of services by Thobela FM reached 180 000
new listeners in Tolwe, Limpopo. In the course of this month the SABC and
Sentech will be launching a new transmitter service for Ukhozi in Ulundi,
KwaZulu-Natal. All of us in the urban areas have grown accustomed to the
superior and clear sound of FM services. These 1,5 million South Africans
enjoy this service for the first time.

Our programmes to support the community radio sector also entailed
installing seven community radio stations, while 13 were upgraded and
provided with ICT tools to make their work more efficient. However,
licensing has been slow because of staff losses at Icasa. At the same time,
in order to enhance the contribution of broadcasting services towards
improving the daily lives of ordinary South Africans, we worked together
with the community broadcasting sector to ensure the production of content
that is relevant to our people and to specific situations. This task has
been completed and we have been fortunate to witness what some have called
the breed and feed of volunteers.

More than a thousand programmes were produced at the production hubs and
aired in more than 50 community radio stations throughout the country.
Spurred on by our constitutional mandate to create a South Africa that
respects the fundamental rights of women and children, these programmes
have been produced by, with and for women, children, people with disability
and the youth. This mandate will find further extension through a programme
to ensure that the communications infrastructure is accessible to people,
especially those with disabilities.

In the course of last year, we also opened a new frontier by hosting a
community electronic multimedia indaba. Two hundred and fifty participants
from rural-based community radio stations, multipurpose community centres
and telecentres, together with the department, converged to initiate a
process to address the needs of rural communities in the changing
technological environment.

We would like to report on the participation of Sentech in the roll-out of
services in rural areas. Sentech has been pivotal in achieving the roll-out
targets of the broadcasting services, which we earlier spoke about. And in
addition, Sentech has been actively collaborating with the GCIS since 1999
in the planning and the roll-out of multipurpose community centres
throughout the country. In the future, Sentech will assume a greater role
in emergency service delivery, and in disaster relief projects in rural
areas. It will also provide broadband multimedia links to overcome rural
connectivity challenges and support the MPCCs as information hubs.

Last year we spoke of a study to look into the feasibility of a dedicated
parliamentary channel. Consultations with stakeholders have continued and
the regulatory environment will ensure that we establish such a system to
adequately cover Parliament.

In launching the Moral Regeneration Movement, the Deputy President
correctly pointed to the role that broadcasting can play in building a new
moral fibre and entrenching democratic values. Our commentators have
pointed to the missed opportunities to instil new values, a culture of
rights and responsibility, and a new South African identity. Our society
needs a broadcasting sector that contributes to a social discourse that
acknowledges our responsibility to each other.

Discussions are under way with the SABC to develop editorial and news
programming policies to cover issues of content, accuracy and impartiality.
Such policies will have to address standards such as exposure to violence,
criminal activity, gratuitous sex and nudity on our screens and airwaves.

During this year we will introduce to Parliament an amendment to the
Broadcasting Act aimed at expanding the sector through the licensing of
more subscription and regional services to address issues of language and
diversity, as well as radio services in areas where regional services were
not licensed.

This year the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, Icasa,
will ensure that all broadcasting players increase their input of South
African content in line with these regulations. We thank the outgoing
members of Icasa for the service that they have rendered to us,
particularly in the area of regulating our airwaves and telecommunications
sector.

Our parliamentary programme for this year will include the introduction to
Cabinet and Parliament of the Convergence Bill. This will deal with the
convergence of broadcasting, telecommunications, information technologies
and new media, and will present the regulator with new challenges. There
will also be a need to further clarify the role of the policy maker and of
the regulator.

We will also, in the course of this year, receive recommendations from
advisory bodies on how to develop policy frameworks for digital
broadcasting and the display of content on our local and foreign markets.
The process of corporatising and repositioning Bop Broadcasting and Channel
Africa is well under way, even though it was slow. By June this year, a
report will be presented to Cabinet.

With regard to the Post Office, there has been a great deal of
transformation over the past financial year. There was a further roll-out
of public internet terminals and the increasing of postal outlets in
historically disadvantaged areas, as well as the restructuring of the
Postbank and other enterprise reforms.

As members already know, we terminated our strategic management contract
with New Zealand Post International. We express our disappointment at the
inability and failure of the partner to meet their contractual obligations
and our expectations. The investigation into this failure is complete and
the outcome will be presented to Cabinet soon.

However, enterprise reform continues in the Post Office. All systems and
contracts entered into by SAPO and all its subsidiaries are being reviewed
to root out administrative inefficiencies and corruption. Several people
have already been suspended, dismissed and/or charged.

In die afgelope boekjaar is daar 100 publieke internetterminale in
poskantore landwyd bekend gestel. Daar word beoog om 'n verdere 200 van
hierdie terminale in die huidige finansiële boekjaar te installeer. Die
gevolg hiervan is dat die Poskantoor nie meer inligtingstegnologie as 'n
bedreiging kan sien nie, maar eerder as 'n geleentheid om die maatskappy
strategies binne gemeenskappe te plaas as 'n bron van inligting. Deur
hierdie terminale het klein sakemense, besighede en boere wat andersins
nooit toegang tot 'n persoonlike rekenaar sou hê nie, ook die geleentheid
om as e-posgebruikers te registreer en ook e-posadresse te hê. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In the past financial year 100 public internet terminals were introduced
in post offices countrywide. It is envisaged that a further 200 of these
terminals will be installed in the current financial year. The result of
this is that the Post Office can no longer regard information technology as
a threat, but rather as an opportunity to strategically place the company
within communities as a source of information. Through these terminals
small businesspeople, businesses and farmers, who otherwise would never
have access to a personal computer, also have the opportunity to register
as e-mail users and also have e-mail addresses.]

[These seven citizen's Post Offices were implemented, and last year four of
them were officially handed over to the people. This provides our people
with an opportunity of having access to technology wherever they live. I
witnessed this personally when we handed a citizen's Post Office over in
KwaNongoma on 26 February 2002. Matric students from Bhekuzulu High School
witnessed the event and maintained that for the first time in their lives
they had touched a computer. In Thaba Nchu, a correspondence student at
Vista University was afforded the opportunity for the first time to send an
assignment to his professor via e-mail.]

[These posts are in the rural areas. It is exciting that people are
uplifted, and that they have accepted these changes. In Nongoma, KwaZulu-
Natal, the Zulu Kind and Inkosi Moroka eThaba Nchu have e-mail facilities.]

During this financial year we will complete another major initiative that
will further empower our people across economic divides through the
restructuring of the Post Bank. The process of drafting the Post Bank Bill
is well under way. This piece of legislation will address the needs of
millions of unbanked or unbankable South Africans.

For the current financial year, the Minister of Finance announced in the
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement that the Post Office will receive R300
million a year subsidy. This contribution will go to clearly identified
projects, with the specific aim of meeting universal service needs of our
people. These include the extension of electronic transaction systems to
all rural post offices, as well as ensuring a basic quality standard of
services in all post offices across the country. In the meantime, a
firewall has been built between the finances of the Post Office and the
Post Bank.

With regard to human resources, building capacity that will utilise new
technologies to deliver relevant service to all South Africans in any
context and in their languages remains one of our greatest challenges.

The National Electronic Media Institute of South Africa, Nemisa, will
continue to train South African youth in the area of multimedia,
television, radio production and so on. Last year 30 students graduated
from Nemisa in the area of television and radio production. Nemisa has also
introduced a multimedia course in partnership with Multi-Media University
of Malaysia.

More importantly, the focus in training this year will be on delivering web-
based Internet language services for the 11 South African official
languages, a first for us as a nation. Working together with the Department
of Education, Nemisa will also embark on the training of teachers and
school administrators in the use of ICT tools education. This partnership
includes Sentech, and will see the implementation of Edu-Net and the E-
learning centre as an education network service that will link all public
shools.

The Institute for Satellite and Software Applications, ISSA, is another
intervention in bringing about human capital that will position South
Africa as a player in science and space technology. Minister Ben Ngubane
has been telling us that our country needs scientists. His passionate plea
has been heard.

Last year our programme produced 25 masters graduates, 14 of whom were
studying in engineering sciences through Stellenbosch University and 11 of
whom graduated with a master's degree in software engineering through the
Carnegie Mellon University in the US. Many of them are sitting in the
gallery. [Applause.]

During the last financial year the software evaluation centre operated by
ISSA software engineering graduates was established. The process to
establish a computer virus monitoring centre has also been completed.
During this financial year, we will again be working with local
universities in running masters degrees.

Telkom has also made major contributions in this regard and laid great
emphasis on the development, education and training of historically
disadvantaged persons through the centre for learning that has been
assigned a five-year budget of R2,3 billion. To date, a total of 10 691
people have been sponsored through study schemes, bursaries and
scholarships - these were for both Telkom employees and the general public.

As the hon Rajbally once said in this House, ``Siyaya'' [We are on our
way.]

In his state of the nation address, the President said that this year an
ICT university would be established. I am pleased to report that this is on
the way. A great deal of international work has been done within the
country with regard to promoting Nepad. We would like to make the House
aware of the fact that a number of our companies have played an important
role in this regard. Vodacom, MTN and Sentech have extended their
operations into the rest of the continent and we look forward to this
extended connectivity, making a meaningful contribution towards Nepad and
the African Renaissance a reality.

I would like to conclude by thanking the entire staff of the department -
including the director-general, Andile, who has just recently been awarded
a doctorate by the University of Fort Hare - for the sterling work that
they have done. I also wish to thank those who have helped us make this a
reality. [Applause.]

We wish to thank Mark Shuttleworth for taking us with him on his
expedition. He has opened up the world of space technology to many South
Africans, especially the youth. He has done us proud. He was worth the
shuttle.

I also wish to thank my Cabinet colleagues and others. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, we share the sentiments about Mark Shuttleworth.
Our gracious hosts at dinner last night led us down memory lane by quoting
from the 1996 Telecommunications Bill debate. This prompted me to revisit
this debate, and now by way of compliment to this Minister, I want to tell
her what I said about that Minister. I am quoting myself as of October
1996. I said, and I quote:


  The Minister sharply dismisses the comments of industry representatives
  in what was, I regret to say, a wrist slapping performance. He dismissed
  the input of other participants in the process. He said they were ``the
  self-interested input of the advantaged.'' This was an experience which
  embarrassed everyone who treasures the newly independent role that
  Parliament has carved out for itself.

Let me say that the wrist-slapping is not the hon the Minister's style, and
neither does she not listen to industry.

Sy luister miskien meer na party as ander, maar sy luister wel na die
industrie. [She might perhaps listen more to some than others, but in fact
she listens to the industry.]

Today, 7 May, should have been a red letter day for telecoms in South
Africa, because Telkom's monopoly expires. However, it is not consumers who
celebrate today, but Telkom, which loses its exclusivity but has no
competition.
It seems to us that the chief complication in getting a liberalised
environment going is the lack of regulatory certainty. This results, of
course, from the nature of Government's policy and law, as well as the
uncertain conditions in which the regulator functions.

I am going to limit my remarks today to Icasa. Let me place on record, if I
may, that we oppose the selection made for the three vacancies mentioned a
minute ago because, firstly, the best candidate was not selected and,
secondly, a departmental manager is now moving directly across to the
independent regulator. It goes without saying that we will, however,
continue to support and protect that institution.

We are asked to vote an inadequate R111 million for Icasa. Based on
previous performance, Icasa would need at least half as much again. Given
the demands of the second operator licensing process this year, it is
absolutely certain that the amount is too little.

But there is a more fundamental problem, and that is the fact that the
department is still funding the regulator at all. It is now three years and
one month since the Constitutional Court, no less, put it beyond any doubt
that Chapter 9 constitutional institutions may not be treated like line-
function bodies of departments that are active in the same fields.

The constitutional bodies must have funds required reasonably to discharge
their functions, the court said in the IEC case. But unlike the HRC and
other human rights bodies which can function on relatively modest amounts,
Icasa regulates a multimillion rand industry which pays millions in licence
fees and spends millions on litigation, not least against the regulator.

The Constitution makes these bodies subject only to itself and the law, and
accountable to us. The court said in not so many words that it is for us,
and not the executive arm of Government, to provide for the funding. The
court said:


  If this means that old legislative and policy arrangements, public
  administration practices and budgetary conventions must be adjusted to be
  brought in line with the new constitutional prescripts, so be it.

All this means that we must now put in place a mechanism whereby the
regulator is funded. I have specific proposals in this regard. Firstly,
Parliament could set the budget together with Mr Mahlangu's Budget
committee, with the Treasury paying the money out while supervising only
for sound financial practice. Secondly, it is, in my view, still the best
idea to let the regulator retain some of its licence fees, in order to fund
itself. There is, in fact, a precedent: the Auditor-General has a specific
arrangement. Section 213 of the Constitution does not, in fact, insist that
all moneys go directly to the National Revenue Fund. It does allow for
exceptions by an Act of Parliament, and that is exactly what we should be
doing. We should be looking after the regulator and funding them directly.

Mr N N KEKANA: Madam Speaker, perhaps one of the frustrations of debating
with smaller parties like the DP is that they do not have enough time, so
one cannot make sense of exactly what they are talking about. I think we
would welcome a robust debate on issues before us here. The issues that are
raised by the hon Smuts are recycled. Perhaps she did well to go back five
years into history.

We would also like to join our Minister in saluting and remembering Comrade
Steve Vukile Tshwete, a gallant soldier, organiser and leader of our
people. The most befitting tribute to the memory of Comrade Steve Tshwete
is for us to rededicate our commitment to deliver quality and affordable
services to all our people, especially in rural areas.

Today is the end of an era and the beginning of an exciting period in the
telecommunications sector. We are satisfied that the telecommunications
sector is in a position to deliver on many of our policy promises. We are
pleased that Telkom is rated by the Telecom Top 100 Network survey as one
of the top 100 carriers; ranked at number 40 with a revenue stream of
US$4,3 billion. This ranking places a lot of responsibility on Telkom, as
the only operator from the African continent in the top 100 of the world.
Through the capable leadership of its Chief Executive Officer, Sizwe
Nxasana, the management, board and workers of Telkom, the carrier has made
a complete turnaround in operations since the apartheid days.

The strategic partnership with Thintana has yielded positive results, and
we are pleased that Thintana continues to support the initial public
offering process. We believe that Telkom is able to give leadership on the
continent, and we are satisfied that the cable network wrapped around the
African continent will link African countries to other destinations in the
world. Furthermore, South African companies are investing in Africa and
making a meaningful contribution to Nepad.

The switching of traffic in Africa is not just an economic and security
issue, but is about pride and principle. We need to use technology to break
the shackles of colonialism and make a complete break with the past.
African carriers must switch and connect calls originating from one country
on the continent to another without going through Europe. The licence being
issued to Sentech will also increase our capacity to provide first class
services to South Africa and other African countries.

Telkom has, in the last five years, rolled out many telephone services to
priority customers such as schools and clinics. We are, however, concerned
about the number of disconnections that have taken place since the
installation of basic telephone services in rural areas. We are encouraging
people to pay for their services, but also call on Telkom to address this
shortcoming.

Let me address an issue which is of concern to us. This relates to the
standoff between Telkom and the regulator, Icasa, over tariff increases.
The current standoff is not in the interest of the consumers and end users
of services. The sooner this matter is laid to rest, the better. What we
are expecting is a tariff regime that is based on the pocket size of an
average working South African customer. We are calling for the regulator to
be respected by all industry players, including Telkom. The relationship
between the regulator and industry players and between Icasa and Government
departments must be based on professional ethics, norms and clear
guidelines.

The regulator is a custodian of public interest and should take the side of
the consumer. The regulator should furthermore ensure that operators
improve their customer care. We expect that the regulator should also
improve on its administration and regulation of the industry.

A watertight operation by the regulator that leaves no loopholes will limit
the dissatisfaction of the industry and prevent delaying tactics that are
often used by operators to frustrate the implementation of decisions of the
regulator. It is a worldwide practice for an incumbent to use every trick
in the book to frustrate competition, thereby guaranteeing its profits.
Incumbents would publicly encourage competition, but through their deeds
not make it easy for new entrants to enter the market.

The regulator, acting in a fair and transparent manner, becomes the referee
and regulates competition. We expect Icasa to be nondiscriminatory and
treat all players equally. We expect Icasa to protect new entrants, while
being considerate to the interests of Telkom and other existing operators.

We are asking the Minister to consider paying Icasa's legal fees directly
from the national Treasury, because operators with fat budgets tend to
undermine regulations through court battles. Icasa's budget is completely
inadequate to deal with litigation and legal fees of the regulator, so we
are asking the Minister - and the Minister of Finance as well - to
seriously consider this matter.

The introduction of the third cellular operator has increased competition
and, in a limited way, we are beginning to experience the benefits. While
we expect the prices to fall over time, we are still concerned about the
quality of service received by customers. There are still too many dropped
calls and interference: I am experiencing this daily in my constituency. We
expect the cellular operators to have completed their dual network
upgrades, and the regulator should allocate the additional GSM 1800
spectrum.

MTN and Vodacom have repeatedly reported that the existing spectrum
allocation is nearing capacity, but we know that it is technically possible
for them to enlarge the cell size of GSM 900 antennas by using range-
booster technologies. We urged them to do so in the interim. We are aware
that preparatory work is being done to migrate to the GSM 1800 spectrum,
and we call on all parties to co-operate with the regulator to accelerate
both the migration to GSM 1800 and the allocation of the spectrum for use
by telecommunications operators.

The second major area of our attention today is the ongoing transformation
of the SABC into a public broadcaster. The SABC must be transformed into a
broadcaster that delivers on its mandate to inform, educate and entertain.
A lot of work has been done over the years since 1994 to turn the
corporation into a public broadcaster that we can all identify with and be
proud of as South Africans.

As members of this Parliament, we have passed legislation to create a legal
framework for a speedy transformation of the SABC into a South African
national public broadcaster. We are confident that the split of the SABC
into public and commercial services is on course.

Many of the activities of the SABC are, however, aimed at positioning it to
attract audiences and to compete with other broadcasters. The task of
appeasing advertisers while delivering quality programming that educates
and informs is, indeed, an onerous one.

There is no doubt that locally produced content has a massive following and
attracts quality audiences. We call on the SABC to engage the advertising
industry to support popular programmes. Local content can only succeed if
broadcasters and advertisers support the creative work of South African
producers. The commissioning procedures of the SABC received attention
recently in our committee. We are concerned that only a few companies
produce programmes. The products of independent black producers must also
be used. Whilst we are satisfied that the corporation managed to break
even, we are concerned about the repeats which reflect that the programming
budget is under pressure.

We would like to see more current affairs programmes in all languages, so
that the SABC could become a platform for citizens to participate in
discussion about their lives. We believe that the SABC is falling short of
its mandate as a public broadcaster. It should be more developmental in its
work. There is a need to find a fair balance between entertainment,
education and information programmes. The moral regeneration of our
communities must be reflected in the broadcasting content of the SABC. We
are pleased that the Minister has indicated that some of these matters are
being addressed.

The SABC newsroom is another area that needs attention. It must reflect
content that captures the reality of life in South Africa. The people are
generators of news. Their experience is what is reality. Actuality and news
are a reflection of their reality and experience. We have noted that
changes have taken place and we are calling for leadership and stability in
the newsroom. During our last portfolio committee visit to the SABC, we had
the honour of visiting the engine of the newsroom and experienced first-
hand how headline news and breaking stories are handled by the news
division.

It is clear from the quality of news broadcast that more resources are
needed to improve the quality of journalism, and that more correspondents
should be placed in African countries and throughout the world. A lot of
work has gone into improving the coverage of the African continent. Gone
are the gloom and doom that we were so accustomed to on the CNNs and the
BBCs of this world. As an African broadcaster, the SABC must, together with
other broadcasters on the continent, tell the untold stories of success of
the African continent.

The SABC must interpret, analyse and tell the world news from a South
African perspective, independent of the CNN's and the BBC's angle. We need
to build the SABC, not only as a mirror of society, but also as a wider
platform for debate, discussion, synthesis and dissemination of information
from all sectors of our communities. We are also calling on the SABC to
introduce news broadcasts and programmes that are aimed at informing and
educating the youth about their responsibilities and roles in society.
Children watch the early current news bulletins and, as such, we need to
make sure that they are free of violence and explicit material.

The new generation of management at the SABC has already done a lot to
complete the work that was started in 1994. We support this new generation
of management at the helm of the SABC. We have confidence in their ability
and dedication to deliver on the mandate of the public broadcaster.

Transformation of the SABC has been going on for a long time. We must
finally move towards achieving the objectives set out in the charter of
broadcasting cast in law. The board and management of the SABC must soon
declare that the restructuring of the entity has been completed and that
the broadcaster must now focus sharply on delivering quality services.

We as a portfolio committee periodically meet the board and management of
the SABC. We have raised many issues of concern and we have noted
improvements. But we have also identified challenges that must urgently be
addressed. We are confident that the SABC will take into account our views
and those of different stakeholders and position the broadcaster to deliver
on its mandate.

I would not really address the issue of postal services, because some of my
colleagues will deal with it. However, I must just say that we have full
confidence in the CEO, management and workers of the Post Office. We must,
however, issue a strong warning to corrupt and criminal elements within the
Post Office that molato ga o bole [the law has a long arm]. [Applause.]

Lastly, this House must congratulate our Minister on the sterling work she
is doing on the African continent. Just this weekend she met with the
African advisory group, which is made up of established leaders in the ICT
sector. She also chairs the Ministerial Oversight Committee that will be
meeting in Cairo from 11 to 12 May 2002. This work on the continent is
important for South Africa, because we do not expect to develop whilst
there is a sea of technology deficiency in other countries on our
continent.

We should also thank the capable leadership of the Director-General of
Communications, Andile Ngcaba, the deputy director-general and members of
their staff. The Department of Communications has made great strides in
positioning Government and the entire industry to grow and develop. We give
our full support to this Budget Vote.

Finally, I just want to say that the portfolio committee wishes - and I
understand that they are here in the gallery - to express thanks for the
commitment and dedication of the outgoing councillors of Icasa, Lubbe Loyd,
Willy Currie and Jasmin Carrim, who have completed their contribution to
the Public Service under the regulator. We wish them well in their new
responsibilities.

The last matter that we need to explain to this House is that,
unfortunately, on Friday we had to postpone the meeting of our committee to
look in depth at the budget of the department. I have explained to my
colleagues from other political parties that due to the funeral of Comrade
Steve Tshwete, we had to postpone that meeting and that we would hold a
responsible meeting of our committee to deal with the budget of the
department in detail and invite stakeholders who wish to participate before
this House considers the Vote itself.

Of course, I would also like to thank all my colleagues, even from
opposition parties. We try our best to quarrel, but also to put the
interests of the industry first and to ensure that all our portfolio
organisations deliver on this very important mandate of improving universal
service in our country, ensuring that all our people - rural and urban,
white and black, women, children and everybody else - receive quality
services from this industry that is fast growing. We are very proud of many
of those who are up there in the gallery, including students who will soon
be going up into space like Mark Shuttleworth [Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Madam Speaker, the few minutes allocated to the IFP today
cannot possibly do justice to our attempts at an analysis of this Budget
Vote.

We have concerns relating to various unexplained line items of expenditure.
Currently we have more questions than answers. It is unfortunate that it
was not possible, as explained, for the department to brief the
communications committee as scheduled last Friday when some light may have
been shed on some issues.

The IFP is, therefore, not in a position to indicate its final decision on
this Budget Vote until the information we seek is forthcoming. It is
acknowledged that this Vote is complex. The approximately R800 million
under discussion today involves diverse matters relating to
telecommunications, broadcasting and postal services.

For those of us who have served on this committee since 1994, it is
becoming glaringly obvious that the three Ministers to date have yet to be
able to streamline Government policy development and delivery targets in
many areas for a variety of reasons. The Minister has our sympathy. This is
not a criticism as such: it is just fact.

One promise has, however, been kept, and that is today's celebration of the
end of Telkom's monopoly. Putting aside for one moment our empathy with the
howls of anguish over tariffs, the fact is that Telkom and its foreign
equity partner, Thintana, have delivered. For this, we must thank them.

A current R40 billion debt - some say R50 billion, and I do not have the
exact figures - is testimony to the roll-out of infrastructure, new and
innovative service delivery and critically needed skills transfer.

Explanatory notes for Vote 26 in the Estimates of National Expenditure tell
us that the department's policy-making objectives include those magic
words: regulation and accessible service. But, let us ask ourselves: Do the
public in the main and the industry in general think that the
telecommunications sector is well regulated? The answer, alas, is no. By
way of illustration, last year we had the Cell-C fiasco, so we will not go
into that again. However, recent events have shown Telkom, of which, we
must not forget, this Government is a major shareholder, being accused of
riding roughshod over consumers who are bearing the brunt of skyrocketing
tariffs. If that is not bad enough, Telkom continues to show open contempt
for the regulator, Icasa. It is also trying to flout the provisions of the
Telecommunications Amendment Act. One cannot accuse Telkom of not trying to
protect its turf. All over the world, incumbents do not go quietly into the
dawn of competition.

Many in our committee are anxious to know whether the Department of
Communications, following a recent meeting in the United States with
Telkom's strategic equity partner, Thintana, is intending to bend to
pressure and amend the amendment Act and/or backtrack on carrier
preselection and matters relating to interconnection. If they do, we can
wave goodbye to competition in the near future. Meanwhile we are about to
license a second national operator and already there is another tug of war
going on between the department and Icasa - which is supposed to be
independent but the department, clearly, does not think so.
Are policy and delivery targets in the broadcasting sector on track? The
answer, again, is no. The development of community radio outreach seems to
be shambolic. Up at Auckland Park the warning bells are already ringing
about the proposed public-commercial split of the SABC. What about the Post
Office? One can mention fraud; corruption; a brave CEO fighting back and
receiving constant death threats for his efforts; a foreign management
contract that has, at vast expense, gone belly-up; and subsidies that are
with us again. So, its time is up. What are we voting for again? It looks
like, yet again, tens of millions being spent in various guises by the
department on a variety of consultants, and I am asking members to tell us
that this is not true.

Let us briefly remind ourselves of the agonies and the flip-flops relating
to the Telecommunications Amendment Bill. Consultants here and
internationally received huge sums of money for this project alone and one
of the IFP's as yet unanswered questions is: just how much? Our committee
has had to literally rewrite this Bill. The legal drafting was, quite
frankly, a disgrace. Many more millions will also be spent on public
servants, some of whom claim expertise which has not been apparent to our
committee.

On a more positive note, the department and its director-general, in
particular, have always been long on excellent and exciting vision. Superb
work is being done, as the Minister has outlined, particularly in laudable
skills development programmes. I would like to say to the Minister that
clearly, as the saying goes, one cannot win them all, especially in the
praise department on a day like today.

Mnr J J DOWRY: Mevrou die Speaker, Mnr die Minister, wanneer ons die
afgelope jaar in oënskou neem, kan die Minister en die DG, mnr Andele
Ngcaba, met tevredenheid terugkyk op wat bereik is op die gebied van
kommunikasie. Die instelling van die derde selfoon netwerk is suksesvol
afgehandel, en meer as 450 000 intekenare het reeds by cell C ingeteken.
Dit bied nie net goeie kompetisie in die bedryf nie, maar verbruikers kan
ook voordeel trek uit beter finansiële pakkette wat aangebied word.
Daarbenewens is baie nuwe werkgeleenthede geskep, wat tans uiters
noodsaaklik is vir ons land. Die Nuwe NP, wat in die verlede sterk gepleit
het vir die kompetisie, is bly dat dit nou 'n werklikheid geword het.

Tweedens, is die skepping van die projek:``Internet 2000'', wat beoog om
aan 2000 prioriteitskliënte, waaronder veral skole, internetskakeling te
bied, nóg 'n waardevolle gebeurtenis. Mense in plattelandse gebiede kan
groot baat hierby vind. Die samewerking tussen die departemente van
Kommunikasie en Gesondheid sal help om multimedia te gebruik om die gaping
te oorbrug en aan plattelandse gebiede toegang te verleen tot mediese
bronne wat andersins nie bereikbaar sou wees nie.

Nog 'n positiewe ontwikkeling is die lisensiëring van Sentech om vaste
lyndienste te lewer. Dit laat die monopolie van Telkom gedeeltelik ten
einde loop. Dit sal nie net die ongesonde monopolie van Telkom vorentoe
beëindig nie, maar sal ook kompetisie bring wat tot voordeel van
verbruikers sal strek.

Telekommunikasiekostes sal uiteraard hierdeur afgedwing word. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, Mr Minister, if we take a look at the past
year, the Minister and the DG, Mr Andele Ngcaba, can look back with
satisfaction on what was achieved in the field of communications. The
establishment of the third cellphone network has been successfully
completed, and more than 450 000 subscribers have already subscribed to
cell C. Not only does this provide good competition in the industry, but
consumers are also able to benefit from better financial packages that are
provided. Moreover, more jobs have been created, which is currently
extremely necessary for our country. The New NP, which has pleaded strongly
in the past for this competition, is happy that it has now become a
reality.

Secondly, the creation of the Internet 2000 project, which envisages
providing internet access to 2 000 priority clients, including schools in
particular, has been another valuable occurrence. The people in rural areas
can greatly benefit from this. The co-operation between the Department of
Communications and the Department of Health will help by using multimedia
to bridge the gap and to provide rural areas with access to medical sources
that would otherwise not have been accessible.

Another positive development is the licensing of Sentech to deliver fixed-
line services. This partly brings the monopoly of Telkom to an end. This
will not only put an end to the unhealthy monopoly of Telkom in the future,
but will also bring about competition which will be to the benefit of
consumers.

Telecommunications costs will inevitably be forced down by this.]

For much too long the telecommunications market for fixed-line services was
dominated by Telkom. Under its licence conditions, among other things, was
the right to be the exclusive provider of basic telecommunication services
to South Africans for five years. The result has been that for five years
South African telecommunications users, despite a boom in the global
market, have endured different high costs in different services, and the
attempt by Telkom to limit the activities of Internet service providers and
value-added network services operators. Thus, due to the fact that Telkom's
monopoly is due to end, South Africans can eagerly look forward to the
benefits of a competitive telecommunications market. Because of this
positive effect that this scenario will have on consumers, the Minister and
the department must be commended for these developments.

We hope that the duopoly in this field will not last forever, especially
against the background of the widespread unhappiness in the industry. Our
country has the potential to thrive in the information technology field but
to do that we need good, cheap and widespread telecommunications.

The lack of an interconnect agreement between mobile network operators on
SMS is preventing the roll-out of certain mobile value-added services.
These cannot survive without a revenue-sharing regime among stakeholders in
a proliferating revenue stream within the m-commerce sector. The
negotiations between mobile operators have been protracted for far too long
and require the urgent intervention of the Minister and Icasa, if we are to
become globally competitive, especially with the early adoption of third-
generation network services.

The recent reports of unsolicited e-mail and SMS marketing messages
referred to as spam need to be addressed urgently. If not, consumers will
simply switch off from these important e-commerce and m-commerce revenue
sources to the detriment of the network operators and marketers alike. More
responsible marketing standards must be generated by telecommunications and
marketing companies, and they should be cast in a direct marketing code of
conduct that would ensure that penalties are dealt out when, for example,
marketers sell and acquire a database from a third party to market their
offerings by using spam.

The challenge has reached such massive proportions that some countries are
beginning to block the Internet and e-mail servers in certain countries
that have allowed spam to proliferate unchecked. These challenges must be
urgently addressed in an industry-generated e-commerce and m-commerce
direct marketing code of conduct with should result in amendments to the
relevant legislation and regulations.

Een area wat baie meer aandag verg, is die Poskantoor. Te veel klagtes word
nog ontvang oor 'n gebrek aan doeltreffende basiese posdienste. Hoewel die
nuwe uitvoerende hoof van die Poskantoor met sy visie vir dié instelling 'n
groot indruk op die portefeulje komitee gemaak het, bly dit kommerwekkend
dat die verbruiker steeds sukkel om behoorlike dienslewering te kry.

Dit is al in talle navorsingsprojekte genoem dat daar 'n verband bestaan
tussen geweldsprogramme op TV en geweld in die samelewing. Ander navorsers
het dit weer ontken. Die feit bly staan dat ons met 'n oormaat van geweld
op televisie gebombardeer word. In 'n land soos ons s'n waar mense so
maklik van hulle besittings, en selfs hul lewens, beroof word op 'n
gewelddadige wyse, het die tyd aangebreek dat ons ernstig hierna moet kyk.

Ons hoor ook baie stemme wat deesdae opgaan vir die morele opbou van ons
land en sy mense, maar sommige uitsaaiers wys nou skaamteloos pornografie
op hulle skerms. Dit kan uiters skadelik wees, veral wanneer ``free to
air'' uitsaaiers dié soort programme uitsaai. Die vraag is of dié
uitsaaiers daarop geregtig is om sulke programme uit te saai as daar na
hulle lisensievoorwaardes gekyk word.

Die Nuwe NP steun die Kommunikasie begrotingspos. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[One area which requires far more attention is the Post Office. Too many
complaints are still received about the lack of effective basic postal
services. Even though the new chief executive officer of the Post Office
made a great impression on the portfolio committee with his vision for this
institution, it remains a matter of concern that the consumer still
struggles to receive proper service delivery.

It has been mentioned in several research projects that there is a
correlation between programmes containing violence on television and
violence in society. Other researchers, again, have denied this. The fact
remains that we are bombarded with an excess of violence on television. In
a country such as ours where people are so easily robbed of their
belongings, and even their lives, in a violent manner, the time has come
for us to pay serious attention to this.

We also hear many voices these days in support of the moral upliftment of
our country and its people, but some broadcasters are now shamelessly
showing pornography on their screens. This can be extremely damaging,
especially when ``free to air'' broadcasters broadcast these kinds of
programmes. The question, if we look at their licence conditions, is
whether these broadcasters are entitled to broadcast such programmes.

The New NP supports the Communications Vote.]

Mr R D PIETERSE: Madam Speaker, I quote:


  We must develop our own strategic response that will ensure that we meet
  the obligations to our people as identified in the Freedom Charter.
  Critical in this regard is the matter of human resource development. We
  have to exert maximum effort to train the necessary number of our people
  in all the fields required for the development, running and the
  management of the modern economics.


  This again must be a natural effort in which we should consider the
  necessary expenditure, not as a cost, but as an investment in our future.
  We have to ensure that as many of our people as possible master modern
  technologies and integrate them in their social activities, including
  education, delivery of services and economic activities. This relates
  particularly to communication and information technology.

This is a quotation from a statement made by President Thabo Mbeki before
the National Executive Committee of the ANC on 8 January 2002.

As these are our marching orders as Africans, please allow me to
immediately ask the question: Where, in the context of Nepad, is Africa
located in this debate? As the rest of the world, led by the G8, has
accepted Nepad as a programme to awaken Africa as an economic giant, as it
should be, South Africa should be seen to be taking the lead when
developing its own economy.

Having said that, we should not forget that prior to 1994 South Africa was
the bully of the continent, destabilising countries - particularly in the
SADC region that dared to offer shelter and food to freedom fighters from
South Africa. Hence one will find many economies of SADC countries are
underdeveloped, courtesy of the pre-1994 South African military might.
Whilst we should not live in the past, we must accept our past, as painful
as it might be for some of us sitting here today. Only then can we develop
and work towards a better future for all. We should also not only help our
fellow South Africans out of guilt, but because it is correct. That is the
only way to rebuild our beautiful continent.

Having said that, allow me to commend Comrade Minister and his department,
which is led by an excellent director-general, Dr Andile Ngcaba. The
Minister and his department have done great work in preparing this budget,
whilst addressing pertinent questions.

Ek wil graag vir 'n oomblik stilstaan by die media in die algemeen.
Mediavryheid is een van die pilare waarop demokrasie gebou word - en dit is
beslis in ons geval so - maar vryheid van wie ookal, is nie absoluut nie.

Net soos mediavryheid sy verantwoordelikheid het, het ons ook. Daarom moet
ons die media beskerm en sy vryheid gee binne die verantwoordelikheid van
alle demokrate.

Wanneer ons verskil, en ek glo ons sal somtyds verskil, en wanneer ons nie
kan skik nie, kan ons nie mekaar te lyf gaan omdat ons nie saamstem nie -
soos onlangs gedemonstreer is deur 'n bekende kunstenaar.

Ons en vele andere wat hulself die beskermers van demokrasie en
mediavryheid noem, het geskitter in ons stilte. Nie 'n woord het van ons
kant gekom om die aanval op die joernalis te verdoem nie. Ons stilte kan
gesien word dat ons saamstem met die aanval op die joernalis, wat dan
gesien kan word as 'n aanval op mediavryheid. Hierdie aanvaller word selfs
as 'n held gesien deur sommige mense.

Die vraag wat ek dan wil vra, is: Kunstenaar of kuns?

Die afgelope tyd het die uitsaaier onder talle aanvalle deurgeloop. Sommige
van die aanvalle was ongevraagd en onbillik teenoor die openbare uitsaaier,
die SABC.

Ek dink dit is onregverdig om te kritiseer net omdat mens in opposisie is
of om te kritiseer omdat jy 'n spreekbeurt het en niks anders het om te sê
nie. As mens niks goed het om te sê nie, wil ek tog aanbeveel dat so iemand
sal stilbly en miskien kry die mense daarmee respek vir daardie persoon.

Mens kan nie aanhou steen en been kla en swartgallig wees en dan sê dit is
my plig as lid van die opposisie nie. Wees konstruktief wanneer goed
uitgewys word en word 'n vrywilliger om die land te help opbou. Hierdie
land behoort aan almal van ons wat dit bewerk en bewoon, beide wit en
swart.

Verskeie mense beweer dat die SABC nie sy mandaat uitvoer nie, en dit is om
in te lig, te onderrig en te vermaak. Maar daar word beweer dat te veel
klem gelê word op vermaak. Ek wil tog aan die mense van die SABC wat hier
is, sê dat as hulle kort raak aan materiaal, moet hulle maar net 'n draai
maak in die Parlement. Hulle behoort genoeg daarvan te kry.

Dieselfde kommentaar word genoem teenoor Telkom, van wie daar verwag word
om wêreldklasdienste teen 'n ondergemiddelde fooi te lewer en dan nog aan
die einde van die periode winste te wys wat kompeterend is teenoor 'n
privaatinstansie.

Het die mense hul feite reg? Is behoorlike navorsing gedoen? Of is dit hoe
ons voel enige tyd van die dag? Is dit 'n geval van ons eie
verantwoordelikheid teenoor ons kinders en familie afskuif aan iemand
anders, wat sê daar is te veel porno en te veel geweld? Ons kyk nie na ons
eie familie nie en nou is dit iemand anders se verantwoordelikheid. Moet
alles verander terwyl ons weier om te verander of te stadig is om te
verander?

Welkom tot die wêreld van globalisasie.

Ons kan natuurlik nie net klem lê op televisie nie. Ek wil byvoeg dat daar
gedurig gepraat word oor die drie uitsaaiers - SABC, M-Net en e.tv. Ek glo
dat die konstruktiewe gesprekke tussen hulle sal vrugte dra, vernaam wat
sport betref.

Hier bedoel ek nie net sport van nasionale belang nie, maar ook die
sogenaamde aspoestertjiesportsoorte. Elke sport wat deur vroue en
gestremdes beoefen word, is aspoestersportsoorte en word nie sodanig gedek
in die sogenaamde ``prime time'' nie. Waar ons vir MNet vra om nie hul
geldelike spiere te misbruik nie, is dit ook belangrik dat die SABC
Topsport nie die ewige bedelaar bly nie. SABC moet kompeterend raak wat sy
mandaat betref: Om in te lig, te onderrig en te vermaak.

Ons moet toesien dat senders op strategiese plekke geplaas word, sodat alle
seine na elke uithoek van ons land gestuur word. Ons mense op die
platteland verdien dit en betaal hulle lisensiegeld.

Ek wil 'n spesiale beroep doen op ieder en elkeen van ons: Betaal ons
lisensiegeld betyds en elke keer. Betaal die agb mnr Gerber sy
lisensiegeld? Agb Kannemeyer? Agb Walters? As ons dit nie doen nie, het ons
nie die reg om te kritiseer nie. Ons mense op die platteland, of dit nou
Haarlem teen die Ooskaapse grens is of Ladysmith teen die Overberggrens; of
dit Albertinia of Heidelberg of Stilbaai is, of waar ookal op die
platteland, soek almal 'n gelyke kans. Hulle bedel nie. Hulle praat
Afrikaans. Hulle is hardwerkend. Hulle is vroue en die jeug en is van die
trotsste Suid-Afrikaners wat mens kry. Ek betaal my lisensie.

Die ope en opregte vraag is natuurlik: Waar is Sentech in hierdie debat?
Wat is hulle rol in die verskaffing of daarstelling van seine? Ek wil graag
sien dat Sentech 'n meer leidende rol speel wat seinverskaffing aan ons
mense betref. Daarom glo ek dat wanneer die SABC hergestruktureer word in
die ``Public Broadcasting Service'' en die ``Private Commercial
Broadcasting Service'', baie van die vrae beantwoord sal word.

Sentraal binne hierdie herstrukturering moet die kwessie van werkskepping
wees. Elke keer wanneer een persoon sy werk verloor, is dit een persoon te
veel, want die kettingreaksie daarop is meermale katastrofies.
Herstrukturering kan nie gelykstaande wees aan werkverlies nie, maar eerder
as werksgeleentheid met voorkeur aan ons vroue en die jeug. Werkverskaffing
begin natuurlik by werkbehouding en daarom is werkopleiding en heropleiding
van kardinale belang.

Die radio het nog altyd 'n belangrike rol in ons lewens gespeel en sal
moontlik nog vir 'n baie lang tyd. En tog lyk dit asof ons so min tyd
daaraan spandeer. Soos die radiogedeelte van die uitsaaiwese
gedemokratiseer word, sien ons die gemeenskapradio baie sterk na vore tree
en bied sterk kompetisie vir die publieke sowel as die privaatradiostasies.
Al is daar sterk kompetisie van die gemeenskapsradios, ondersteun hulle die
gemeenskap wat keuse en prys betref. Wat werkskepping direk en indirek
betref, glo ek dat ander sektore by hulle kan leer.

Natuurlik vind ons gestremdes dit baie moeilik en irriterend om te verstaan
hoekom die uitsaaiers geen respek vir hulle blyk te hê nie. Eerstens is
daar natuurlik gebaretaal wat saam met alles wat gebeeldsend word,
uitgesaai word. Ek verstaan dat dit redelik duur is om te voorsien -
vernaam op so 'n groot skaal, maar ons moet daarvoor beplan. Ons kan nie
altyd geld as 'n verskoning voorhou nie.

Tweedens is die kwessie van onderskrifte in programme wat uitgesaai word. U
weet natuurlik dat talle van die programme wat van oorsee, veral van
Amerika, aangekoop word, reeds onderskrifte het. Plaaslik ontwikkelde
programme is van die uiterste belang ter wille van taal, werkskepping en
kultuur, en daarom moet die nodige geld gevind word vir hierdie programme.

Ek wil 'n sterk pleidooi lewer vir die gestremde kinders wat net in gebare-
taal kan kommunikeer. Kom ons maak seker dat kinderprogramme met gebaretaal
beskikbaar is. Niks kan belangriker wees as om in 'n mens se eie taal te
kan kommunikeer nie - hetsy Afrikaans, Engels, Xhosa of Zulu. Dieselfde
passie en hartstog wat ons vir ons eie moedertaal het, het gestremdes vir
hulle gebaretaal. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[I would like to pause for a moment at the media in general. Press freedom
is one of the pillars on which democracy is built - and that is certainly
true in our case - but freedom of whomever is not absolute.

Just as press freedom has its responsibilities, so do we. We must therefore
protect the media and give it freedom within the responsibility of all
democrats.

When we differ, and I believe that we will sometimes differ, and when we
cannot reach agreement, we cannot attack one another because we do not
agree - as recently demonstrated by a well-known artist.

We and many others who call themselves the protectors of democracy and
press freedom were deafening in our silence. Not a word came from our side
to condemn the attack on the journalist. Our silence can be viewed as
agreeing with the attack on the journalist, which can be viewed as an
attack on press freedom. This attacker is even seen as a hero by some
people. The question I would then like to ask is: artist or art?

The broadcaster has recently suffered numerous attacks. Some of the attacks
were uncalled-for and unfair towards the public broadcaster, the SABC.

I think it is unfair to criticise merely because one is in opposition or to
criticise because one has an opportunity to speak and one has nothing else
to say. When one has nothing good to say, I would like to recommend that
such a person keep quiet and perhaps in that way people will gain respect
for that person.

One cannot continue to complain endlessly and be pessimistic and then say
that is my duty as a member of the opposition. Be constructive when things
are pointed out and become a volunteer to help build the country. This
country belongs to all of us who live and work in it, both white and black.

Various people are alleging that the SABC is not executing its mandate, and
that is to inform, to teach and to entertain. It is being alleged that too
much emphasis is put on entertainment. I would just like to say to the
people from the SABC who are here, that if they are short of material they
simply have to come to Parliament. They should find enough of it.

The same comment is made with regard to Telkom, which is expected to
deliver a world-class service at a lower-than-average fee and then still,
at the end of the day, to show a profit which can compete with that of a
private institution.

Do people have their facts right? Has proper research been done? Or is this
how we feel any time of the day? Is this a case of shifting our own
responsibility towards our children and families to somebody else, who says
there is too much pornography and too much violence? We are not seeing to
our own family and now it is someone else's responsibility. Must everything
change while we refuse to change or are too slow in changing?
Welcome to the world of globalisation.

We can, of course, not only emphasise television. I would like to add that
the three broadcasters are constantly talked about - SABC, M-Net and e.tv.
I believe that the constructive discussions between them will bear fruit,
particularly as far as sport is concerned.

Here I am not only talking about sport of national interest, but also the
so-called Cinderella sports. Each sport practised by women and the disabled
is a Cinderella sport and is not really covered in the so-called prime
time. While we are asking M-Net not to abuse their financial muscle, it is
also important that SABC Topsport does not remain the eternal beggar. The
SABC must become competitive as far as its mandate is concerned: to inform,
to educate and to entertain.

We must see to it that transmitters are placed in strategic places, so that
all signals can be sent to every corner of our country. Our people in the
rural areas deserve this and pay their licence fees.

I would like to make a special appeal to each and every one of us: pay our
licence fees on time and every time. Does the hon Mr Gerber pay his licence
fees? Hon Kannemeyer? Hon Walters? If we do not do so, we do not have the
right to criticise. Our people in the rural areas, be it Haarlem on the
Eastern Cape border or Ladysmith on the Overberg border; be it Albertinia
or Heidelberg or Stillbaai, or wherever in the rural areas, are all seeking
an equal chance. They are not begging. They speak Afrikaans. They are hard-
working. They are women and the youth and are among the proudest South
Africans one can find. I pay my licence.

The honest and sincere question is, naturally: Where is Sentech in this
debate? What is their role in the provision or establishment of signals? I
would like to see Sentech playing a more leading role as regards signal
provision to our people. For that reason I believe that when the SABC is
restructured into the Public Broadcasting Service and the Private
Commercial Broadcasting Service, many of the questions will be answered.

Central within this restructuring must be the issue of job creation. Every
time one person loses their job, that is one person too many, because the
chain reaction is frequently catastrophic. Restructuring cannot be equal to
job loss, but rather to job creation, with preference given to our women
and the youth. Naturally, job creation begins with job retention and for
that reason vocational training and retraining are of cardinal importance.

The radio has always played an important role in our lives and will
possibly do so for a very long time. And yet is seems that we spend so
little time on it. As the radio component of broadcasting is democratised,
we see the community radios coming forward very strongly and offering stiff
competition for the public as well as the private radio stations. Although
there is stiff competition from the community radios, they support the
community as far as choice and price are concerned. As far as job creation
is concerned, directly and indirectly, I believe that other sectors can
learn from them.

Naturally, our disabled people find it very difficult and irritating to
understand why the broadcasters appear to have no respect for them.
Firstly, of course, there is sign language which is broadcast with
everything that is televised. I understand that this is reasonably
expensive to provide - particularly on such a large scale, but we must plan
for it. We cannot always use money as an excuse.

Secondly, there is the issue of subtitles in programmes which are
broadcast. Members know, of course, that many of the programmes which are
purchased overseas, particularly from America, already have subtitles.
Locally developed programmes are of the utmost importance for the sake of
language, job creation and culture, and the necessary funding must
therefore be found for these programmes.

I want to make a strong appeal for the disabled children who can only
communicate in sign language. Let us make sure that children's programmes
with sign language are available. Nothing can be more important than to be
able to communicate in one's own language - be it Afrikaans, English, Xhosa
or Zulu. Disabled people have the same passion and keenness for sign
language as we have for our own mother tongue.]

Sign language is a very expressive language. My advice is that one must
watch it and fall in love with it. Let us not continue to use money as an
excuse for not delivering on the question of language. Please find the
necessary funds and see these funds as an investment in human resource
development, and not as a cost.

Maar die kwessie van taal kan nie net die verantwoordelikheid van die SABC
wees nie. Waar plaas ons e.tv en M-Net? Wat doen hulle wat die ander 11
tale bevorder? Wat meer nog van gebare taal. Wat is hulle
gemeenskapsverantwoordelikheid, of sal ek vra, het hulle so 'n
verantwoordelikheid?
Die uitsaaiers moet meer met mekaar praat wat die uitdagings betref. Die
uitsaaier, wat so baie invloed oor ons kinders, ons jeug en selfs die ouers
het, moet aangewend word vir die heropbou van morele standaarde in ons
gemeenskap. Parallel moet hulle as deel van hul gemeenskapsdiens ingespan
word in ons stryd teen byvoorbeeld misdaad en Vigs. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[However, the issue of language cannot only be the responsibility of the
SABC. Where do we place e.tv and M-Net? What are they doing to promote the
other 11 languages? Not to mention sign language. What is their community
responsibility, or should I ask, do they have such a responsibility?

The broadcasters should talk to one another more regarding the challenges.
The broadcaster, which has so much influence over our children, our youth
and even the parents, must be utilised for the regeneration of moral
standards in our community. At the same time, as part of their community
service, they must be included in our battle against crime and Aids, for
example.]
But not all is doom and gloom. Good work is taking place, maybe not fast
enough; transformation is taking place, definitely not fast enough;
deliveries are happening. Maybe it is the reality of pace; maybe we are too
impatient and are becoming our own worst enemies.

We should all get up and mobilise our constituencies that we claim we are
representing and get involved as volunteers to rebuild this beautiful
country of ours. We should stop being armchair critics and running down our
broadcasters as we do with Telkom.

I want to thank the outgoing councillors, Libby, Yasmin and Willie. I also
want to thank the department and the staff, the SABC and the chief
volunteer in particular, the Minister of Communications. The ANC supports
this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, may I congratulate you on your elevation to the
Chair and express the hope that you will have a very fruitful term.
Prior to 1994, the South African communication sector was mainly
characterised by international isolation and insufficient co-operation in
the field of electronic commerce, as well as either on overregulated
communication environment and insufficient mechanisms for the regulation
thereof, or a lack of access by the poorer sectors of society to
communication tools.

In addition, communication policies and processes did not make provision
for matters such as gender representation or the economic empowerment of
women. The erstwhile South African Communication Service focused most of
its attention on conveying the Government of the day's policies internally,
resulting in not enough focus being placed on securing a position for South
Africa in the international communication sector.

From an historical perspective, most of the changes and developments in the
communication sector can be traced back to the adoption of South Africa's
first democratic Constitution. The result was that the communication sector
shifted its position towards becoming more inclusive by focusing on
improving the quality of life of all South Africans, to assist in creating
an information society.

Apart from meeting the newly established democratic obligations, this
became an essential characteristic of the South African communication
sector, because South Africa started to evolve as an active role-player in
the international arena. This placed the enormous responsibility of the
liberalisation of the IT and ICT sectors on the communication sector in
bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries
which, for obvious reasons, did not receive the deserved attention during
the period preceding 1994.

The transformation of the broadcasting sector in South Africa was based on
the challenge of building a new democratised nation. The role of the sector
is to construct a vibrant and democratic dispensation which focuses on
fostering a national and cultural identity, as well as equality and respect
for the fundamental rights of all South Africans.
It became clear that large sections of the population, deprived of a choice
of service, mainly relied on radio to meet their broadcasting needs. The
reforms in this sector, therefore, focused on infrastructure distribution
and resource allocation, including frequencies, human resource development
and financial assistance, a more just language distribution, universal
coverage and access. This process started with the Independent Broadcasting
Authority Act.

In 1996, the IBA published a discussion paper on community broadcasting
services, with the purpose of inviting comments on advertising,
sponsorship, financial and other business information, record-keeping,
programming obligations and fines for noncompliance with licence
conditions. This was the start of the important process of placing emphasis
on the regional broadcasting needs in South Africa, with particular
reference to community broadcasting services. I have to complete my speech!

While it is clear that the Department of Communications is committed to
extending its services to all South Africans, the department should be
encouraged to focus on its informative role, mainly in the following two
areas: existing and newly established multipurpose community centres should
be encouraged to extend their services to include training and adding
skills in the use of information technology. This initiative is underpinned
by the Nepad schools initiative, with the goal of ensuring that every
African child is technologically literate within 10 years. The initiative
should be extended to all existing and newly established MPCs. It should
not necessarily be a Government-driven project; but private-sector
partnerships could be helpful in this process.

Finally, the involvement of the department in combating the scourge of
HIV/Aids, given its infrastructure and access to expertise in this field,
is at this stage unclear. [Time expired.]

Mr V C GORE: Mr Chairperson, Minister, hon members, today's debate will be
remembered, not because of rands and cents, but rather because 7 May 2002
marks the end of the exclusivity period for Telkom and the beginning of
competition.

However, today there is not going to be any real competition. At this
stage, I would like to remind the hon Kekana that the reason why Telkom has
managed to get such high revenues is because they have had no competition
in the past. The South African consumer still does not have a choice, nor
will there be lower prices, better services or even an increased number of
telephones. South Africa will only get real competition in a few months'
time, or is it in a few years' time?

The reason for this delay is quite simple: a bit of sitting on the fence
with a flip-flop here and there, and at times complete inactivity on the
part of the department. This behaviour is rather contagious. South Africa
still waits with bated breath for the IPO for Telkom from the DTI.

Five years ago to this day, the House granted Telkom the right to be the
only fixed-line operator in exchange for a number of universal service
obligations. There can be no doubt that Telkom kept to the letter of the
obligations and installed all of the required telephone lines.

However, how many of these lines are no longer working because of
disconnection? Half a million in the year 2000 alone. It is obvious that
this model has not worked, and it is vitally important that this country
does not make the same mistake when the SNO is licensed.

When competition does eventually arrive in South Africa, a predictable and
stable regulatory environment will become even more crucial. In this
regard, the DA welcomes the recent announcement that Icasa and the
competition commission have reached an agreement on their areas of
jurisdiction in the broadcasting and telecommunications industries. This
agreement will free up much-needed resources for Icasa and loosen the grip
of the DRC on the regulator.

In addition, many of the problems that have previously been outlined could
have been avoided had this House voted more for Icasa and ensured
alternative allocation avenues, as suggested by my colleague, the hon Dene
Smuts, and by the hon Kekana. These two measures would better equip Icasa
to retain the human capital and avoid their staff being poached by a better-
paying industry.

In conclusion, if competition is going to succeed, and if the industry is
going to deliver low prices, real choice, better services and more
telephones, then the regulator must be independent and be well-resourced,
and operate in a stable and predictable environment, pushed on by clear-cut
policy directions formulated by Government. Perhaps, then, South Africa
will witness the revolution that the then Minister Jay Naidoo promised this
country in 1997. [Applause.]

Mr M A MAZIYA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, hon guests, today I
am starting my debate in a very special mood. I am proud to confirm that,
yes, the ANC has achieved many of its goals in bettering the lives of
people in our country.

The citizens' Post Office and MPCC are some of the achievements in the most
rural of rural areas.

Akusadingi ukuthi ube nocingo endlini ukuze ukwazi ukufinyelela
ezihlotsheni zakho noma kwamanye amazwe. Akusiyo incwadi yodwa futhi
engakuxhumanisa nezihlobo zakho njengasemandulo ngoba nasemakhaya seyikhona
indlela yokuxhumana ngekhompiyutha okuthiwa i-e-mail. Lena iyona ndlela
ehlakaniphile yezinga eliphezulu lokuxhumana ngokukhuluma nomuntu noma
ngabe ukuphi. Le ndlela ibizwa ngokuthi ikheli labahlali elihanjiswa
ngokwekhompiyutha. Asikho isidingo sokubhala incwadi uma lolu hlobo lweposi
lwamakhompiyutha lukhona lapho uhlala khona.

Bakithi i-ANC indala futhi nemisebenzi yayo iyabonakala ngoba ngalesi
sikhathi esincane seyihambe ibanga elide kwezamaposi. Ubani owayekucabanga
ukuthi uyohlala abhale incwadi, ihambe ngaleso sikhathi engazange athenge
isitembu nemvilophi ngisho ukusukuma nje lapho ahleli khona? Asibonge
bakithi! (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[You no longer need to have a telephone in your house to be able to reach
your relatives or other countries. It is not only a letter that can put you
in touch with your relatives, like in the past, because even in the rural
areas a way of communicating with computers through e-mail is available.
This is an intelligent way of conducting high-level communication by
talking to a person no matter where the person is. This way is known as
addressing residents through computers. There is no need to write letters
if such computer post is available where you live.

Good people, the ANC is old and the fruits of its work are visible, because
in such a short period of time it has gone a long distance as far as the
communication sector is concerned. Whoever thought that he would sit down
and write a letter that would be sent at the same time without buying a
stamp and an envelope, and also without moving from where one is sitting?
Good people, let us say thank you!]

I want to admit that we believe that regardless of the moratorium on the
closing of Post Office outlets, post offices are still being closed in some
rural areas, and months later what one calls a postnet, with urgent post
office services, is opened, which is privately owned. We in the ANC feel
that this may not be the way to go. We still want to see the roll-out of
postal services, as opposed to the closure of Post Office outlets, unless
there are reasons that are convincing to the communities affected.

We also understand that the rates charged by the agency outlets and postnet
are more than the rates charged by the normal, traditional post offices,
and we want this to be changed. Today we see the rolling out of much-
improved postal services for people who had addresses but were not able to
receive letters at their street addresses. They are now getting their post
the same way a person in Sandton would get his or her letter. People in the
informal settlements, where there are no street addresses, have postboxes
placed at their doorstep, without getting into a taxi in order to get their
post.

One must admit that the delays in the postal delivery service are still
cause for concern. Some people in the rural areas are reminded by the
police that they have not paid their fines or attended court hearings. When
these letters or summonses are delayed somewhere in the system, it is not
good enough to say that these are delivered on time. When we say: ``on
time'', do we mean one week or one month? What do we mean? A clear
commitment on our part, and feedback from our communities, will give us a
sense of what we mean.

Kubuye kwasinceda kakhulu, ngeso elihlakaniphile likaNgqongqoshe u-Comrade
Matsepe-Casaburri, ukuthi aqede ubudlelwane nalaba abaphesheya umonakalo
ungakabi mkhulu kakhulu. Babethe bazoguqula indlela yokusebenza yeposi
kanti lokho kwakumosha. Wakubona lokhu wayesethi kungcono bayeke
sizozibonela.

Sibonile emva kwalokho ukuthi kuye kwabakhona izinguquko eziningi. Abaningi
basazozisola ekuhambeni kwesikhathi. I-ANC lena bafowethu ihamba kancane
kodwa yaze yakufica uzozisola. Baningi abayozisola. Kukho konke lokhu
sishayela uNgqongqoshe ihlombe. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[It also helped us a lot that the Minister, Comrade Matsepe-Casaburri,
through her intelligent eye, ended ties with overseas people, which reduced
the damage. They said they would change the way post operates, but that is
expensive. She saw this and she said they should leave it, we ourselves
would see what we could do about it.

We noticed after that that lots of changes were made. Some will have
regrets as time goes on. The ANC moves slowly, but it eventually had
regrets. Many people will have regrets. But for all these things we applaud
the Minister.]

Today the Post Office, through the Postbank which is still part thereof, is
able to assist people who do not have proof of employment, but have proof
of identity, to open banking accounts, which allows them to have ATM cards
that they can use on any ATM machine for deposits or withdrawals. To open
an account, one no longer has to have R200 or more, but only R50. One can
open an account at any Post Office outlet, including the so-called agency
outlets. What remains is for Parliament to have legislation that can
interpret the Post Bank's independence from the Post Office.

Yes, continued access to facilities is still a privilege enjoyed by the
Postbank's clients. Long hours at the ATM queue, if one saves with the
Postbank, will be a thing of the past.

It is also important to educate our communities. The centre where the
public information terminal is situated, which the hon the Minister opened
in Winnie Mandela township near Thembisa, was vandalised and some computers
were stolen. What I mean is that the service that we provided for that
community no longer exists. We want to plead with our communities to look
after their property, because that terminal belongs to the people of Winnie
Mandela township.
Now that the community has forfeited that service, we are saying that our
budget cannot cater every financial year for one service to the same area
that has a few criminals who do not care or even know who pays for that
service.

Developments in both the Post Office and the Postbank have brought with
them a lot of confidence in our country. In that respect, we must
congratulate our Minister, for it is the knowledge that she has brought to
this Ministry that has brought communication in our country where it is
today.

Our Minister has today appointed the chairperson of the oversight
ministerial committee. The confidence shown us by other countries who have
our Minister advise them on communication matters and the benefits reaped
by South African companies that provide services to other countries, call
for an applause for both the Minister and the department for carrying out
the mandate of the ANC. We can now proudly say that we are improving the
lives of our people.
It is for this reason that the ANC supports the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and members, the role of
communication is vital for any emerging democracy. South Africa has the
communications infrastructure to greatly assist in the development of our
region. The Nepad initiative, for instance, can create the launchpad for a
communications rebirth in Africa. The liberation of our telecommunications
sector can greatly contribute to this wave of change on our continent.

The budget of R823 million for this budget year may sound like a reasonable
amount. What we need to take into consideration, though, is the high cost
for keeping our communications industry efficient, especially at
administrative, maintenance and skills levels. In order to effectively
service this nation, we need to beef up the powers and functions of our
communications regulatory authority.

Telkom will be facing a competitive challenge in the near future. Price
wars and service challenges will affect the average consumer and if the
regulatory authority is seen to be weak, the client will be at the mercy of
such service providers.

The recent difference between Icasa and Telkom about tariff hikes is
regrettable, especially in the light of the fact that the matter was taken
to court at great expense to the taxpayer. Why must Icasa, which is
entirely funded by the taxpayer, take Telkom to court if the matter could
have been settled out of court at no expense to the taxpayer?

The concept of co-operative governance should not only be applied at local,
provincial and national level, but should be applied by the parastatal
companies and the regulatory authority. Icasa must explore ways, which
could include mediation and arbitration procedures, that would allow
service providers access to conflict resolution mechanisms in the event of
a stalemate. Icasa cannot waste a single cent of its budget of R111 million
in taking parastatals to court. However, if Icasa is taken to court by
service providers, it must have the means to defend itself.

We as MPs must exercise our oversight role if we observe an increase in the
amount of litigation experienced by Icasa. If a community radio station
with very little resources takes Icasa to court because it views a decision
by Icasa to be partial and unjust, and if the court rules against Icasa,
then this becomes a cause for concern. The value of a good regulator should
not be judged by the amount of court cases that are won, but by the amount
of difficult rulings it makes without the intervention of the Department of
Justice.

We need to regulate our communication industry more efficiently in order to
avoid impropriety and shoddy service. Communication is a powerful tool and
should be used effectively to empower our nation.

The ACDP supports this Budget Vote.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, the FF would like to congratulate the hon
the Minister on the different new developments in her department, and the
new initiatives taken by her department.

Because communication technology is changing all the time at such a rapid
pace, this department must keep abreast of developments.

Die belangrikheid van hierdie departement lê nie net in die hantering van
nuwe tegnologie nie. Die agb Minister se departement het 'n baie belangrike
rol te speel ten einde te verseker dat vryheid van spraak en 'n
demokratiese kultuur in Suid-Afrika heers.

Die gebeure in Zimbabwe waar die uitsaaimedia oorwegend onder staatsbeheer
is, onderstreep hierdie feit. Mense sê maklik dat dit nie hier kan gebeur
nie. Dit kan nie hier gebeur nie as die departement die regte atmosfeer en
gees uitdra. Daarom sê ek: Ons kort meer radiostasies en nie minder nie.
Ons kort meer stemme en meer verskeidenheid. Die Minister het verduidelik
dat 'n gebrek aan personeel by Icasa die vertraging in nuwe lisensies
veroorsaak. Dis moeilik om te verstaan. Die wet maak dit moontlik vir
gemeenskapsradios en dat ons hulle daar kan stel. Die wet maak dit verder
moontlik dat daar twee soorte gemeenskapsradiostasies kan wees, naamlik die
geografiese gemeenskap - onthou u hoe ons ure geworstel het om dit te
definieer - en dan 'n gemeenskap van belange. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The importance of this department does not only lie in the handling of new
technology. The hon the Minister's department has a very important role to
play in order to ensure that freedom of speech and a democratic culture
prevail in South Africa.

The events in Zimbabwe, where the broadcasting media is mostly under state
control, emphasises this fact. People easily say that it cannot happen
here. It cannot happen here if the department conveys the right atmosphere
and spirit. That is why I am saying: We need more radio stations and not
fewer. We need more voices and greater diversity. The Minister explained
that a lack of staff at Icasa is the cause of the delay in respect of new
licences. This is difficult to understand. The Act provides for community
radio and that we may establish it. The Act furthermore provides that there
may be two kinds of community radio, namely the geographic community - do
hon members remember how we struggled for hours to define this - and a
community of interest.]

According to the Act, it is possible to have both a geographical community
and a community of interest. Last year, Icasa refused more than 70% of the
community-of-interest radio licence applications. In the same period, only
26% of the geographic licence applications were refused. This is totally
out of balance, and creates the impression that Icasa has taken sides in
the debate between geographical and community-of-interest radio licences.

I want to come to the SABC. I want to congratulate them in reaching 1,5
million new listeners, hopefully in their own languages.
Die agb Kekana en die agb Pieterse het hier gepraat oor taal en hoe
belangrik taal is en dat mense dit in hul eie taal moet hoor. Hulle het
veral gepleit daarvoor dat nuusprogramme en aktualiteitsprogramme in mense
se eie tale na hulle uitgesaai moet word. Die VF stem heelhartig hiermee
saam.

Tog ervaar ons steeds meer frustrasies met die SABC en dan spesifiek met
die nuusafdeling. Ek weet nie of hulle hier agter verteenwoordig is nie. Ek
sien nie van hul senior mense nie. Die probleem is die volgende: Engels
word al hoe meer en meer gebruik en as die VF in hierdie Raad Afrikaans
praat, dan word mens deur die SABC Nuus geïgnoreer. Die argument is dat die
pakkie in Engels saamgestel word en in Engels uitgestuur word. Dit raak nie
net Afrikaans nie. Mnr Ndlovu van die IVP wat gereeld in Zulu praat om sy
teikengehoor daar buite te bereik, ervaar dieselfde frustrasie, aangesien
alles toenemend meer Engels gemaak word. Dit is onaanvaarbaar, veral
aangesien die SABC sy nuusdiens wil uitbrei.

Ons het dieselfde frustrasie nou by Monitor. Die buitelandse korrespondente
wat in Afrikaans verslag gedoen het, is gestop om verslag te doen. Ek sou
graag wil weet: Hoekom? Die program is nou oorwegend Engels, want die
buitelandse korrespondente word nie meer betaal nie. Ons kry nie
uitbreiding in tale nie. Ons kry al hoe meer en meer beperkinge op die
verskillende tale. Wie het hierdie besluit geneem? Waarom word die besluit
geneem? Hoe kan ons maak dat die verskillende tale in nuusprogramme gehoor
word en nie andersom nie? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The hon Kekana and the hon Pieterse spoke here about language and how
important language is and that people should hear it in their own
languages. They made a special plea that news programmes and actuality
programmes should be broadcast in people's own languages. The FF
wholeheartedly agrees with this.

We are nevertheless only experiencing increasing frustration with the SABC,
and then specifically with the news department. I do not know whether they
are represented at the back here. I do not see any of their senior people.
The problem is the following: English is spoken to an increasing degree and
when the FF speaks Afrikaans in this House, one is ignored by SABC News.
The argument is that the package is composed in English and broadcast in
English. This does not affect Afrikaans only. Mr Ndlovu of the IFP, who
regularly speaks Zulu to reach his target audience out there, experiences
the same frustration, because everything is being Anglicised to an
increasing extent. This is unacceptable, especially as the SABC wishes to
expand its news service.

We now have the same frustration with Monitor. The foreign correspondent
who reported in Afrikaans was stopped from reporting. I would like to know:
Why? The programme is now mainly English, because the foreign
correspondents are no longer paid. We have no expansion of languages. We
encounter more and more limitations on the various languages. Who made this
decision? Why has the decision been made? How can we ensure that the
various languages are heard in news broadcasts, and not the other way
round?]
Ms M R MORUTOA: Chairperson, members of the Cabinet, hon members of
Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dedicate this, my maiden
speech in the National Assembly, to one of the strong women who fought for
the liberation of this country, Comrade June Mlangeni. [Applause.]

The legacy of apartheid and colonialism and the struggle against this
legacy will never be complete until all South Africans have access to new
communications technologies, which are today critical for consolidation of
democracy and economic development.

The voice of the poor, especially that of women, needs to be heard,
including here in the corridors of Parliament. The voices that continue to
be heard in our country remain those of the privileged few who have access
to the infrastructure and tools needed to communicate their views and
concerns.

A quick look at who makes submissions and lobbies the lawmakers during
public hearings tells a story. The story is that they are white, male and
represent a minority in our country. From among the poor, the majority of
whom are women, those who come are few and, in most cases, absent when it
comes to submissions.

The story is, again, that the majority of our people do not have access to
the means that will enable them to be active participants in the decision-
making processes, including those happening in Parliament.

The majority of households in rural areas and underserviced areas are
headed by women. For them, access to a telephone is a lifeline.

It was recently reported in the newspapers that more than 50% of the lines
were cut off by Telkom. When Telkom cut these lines, they must think
carefully about what they are doing and about the social impact of their
action.

Kaloku, ngoomama abajongene nempilo yabantwana emakhaya, kwa namakhaya.
Bayaxhamleka ke xa uTelkom ezinqumamisile iinkonzo zakhe zonxibelelwano,
nto leyo ebangela ukuba kube nzima ukwenza nawaphina amalungiselelo
ngengokuya kwagqirha, ukufowunela isibhedlela okanye abize nokuba ngubani
na ukuze aze kubanceda. Loo nto yenye yeenkathazo. Yiyo loo nto ke sisithi
ezi zinto zonke ziba yinkathazo kubantu abangoomama. (Translation of Xhosa
paragraph follows.)

[Since it is the women's responsibility to look after their families and
children, they struggle when Telkom terminates its telecommunication
services. This causes anyone with children in the house to struggle to find
somebody to help them. This is the reason why we say these things become
problematic to women.]

They must know that their action takes away a lifeline that women depend
on. We agree that our people must pay for the services they receive, but we
must also be mindful of the impact of total disconnection from these
services. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. It undermines the
ideals enshrined in our Constitution and is a betrayal of the memories of
those who made sacrifices, so that South Africa can be free. It betrays the
memories of women like Comrade June Mlangeni, Lilian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph,
Dora Tamana, Dorothy Nyembe and others.

The existence of the Universal Service Agency, community radio stations,
soon to be established media diversity, the development agency and similar
organisations remains important, because the centrality of the universal
service and access to the reconstruction and development of our country is
a key factor. These bodies need to continue to have the collective effort
to rebuild our country and contribute in enabling the majority of our
people - especially those in the rural areas, where over 60% of our
population reside, the majority of whom are women - to be key actors in our
democracy and tell their own story.

They need to continue to help increase the capacity of ordinary people to
participate in governance and economic development. We know that it will
not be easy, given the enormity of the legacy created by apartheid neglect.
The challenge facing all of us is to ensure universal service and access
for all our people, and challenge poverty, centuries of underdevelopment
and marginalisation.

The importance of this task requires all in society to make their
contribution. Have we all played our part? Can the opposition, especially
those leading women in their ranks, put aside their party-political
interests and join in the effort to ensure universal service and access to
the women of our country? [Interjections.] Yes, I am also referring this to
my colleagues in the opposition parties, Dene Smuts and the hon Sue Vos.
The women of this country need us and we dare not let them down. Let us
unite and work together as women on this one. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, may I take this opportunity to congratulate
the hon Morutoa on her maiden speech. Communication, how do we survive
without it and when is it not in operation? Even silence has a message and
is a form of communication. Communication comes in innumerable forms, some
costless while others are costly. Communication ventures near and far, but
is necessary for existence. Communication is a link to each other; it is
our link to the world and to ourselves.

Today communication has been upgraded by technology, and our prime means of
communicating is technology. Posted letters are now replaced by e-mail and
fax, from libraries to Internet, from carbon copies to photocopies - I can
go on and on. The variety of forms of communication that one can exhibit is
enormous.

The MF is aware of the enormous responsibility that the Department of
Communications is given. We note the main authority vested in it regarding
the development and implementation of policy concerning telecommunications,
as well as postal and broadcasting services. Looking at the budget
allocated to this department, the MF is confident that the Department of
Communications will utilise it to the best of their abilities in view of
their objectives and programmes.

The MF is impressed that the department works hard, not just at development
but also at accessibility, which certainly serves to cross the divide of
the past. The department's work towards state-owned entities has been just
as reassuring. The department's works on telecommunications and
broadcasting has been beneficial and the MF applauds their work in rural
development, where they provide services and accessibility to underserviced
communities. The effort to assist schools with IT equipment to connect to
the Internet contributes not only to accessibility, but to education too.

Postal services have been hindered by strikes and dissatisfaction over the
past year. The MF notes the policies that the department hopes to put in
place, so as to overcome the dissatisfaction. Postal services have to
continue. They are a means to meet so many deadlines, both business and
personal. We cannot afford any closed doors. This also relates to the
holders of postal banking accounts that are made unavailable by such
setbacks. It would therefore be appreciated if policies were put in place
so as to avoid this dissatisfaction and maintain a smooth running of the
sector.

Communication is important, we know that. The proper conveyance of our
intentions in what we are doing has earnestly been estimated. The MF
supports this Vote. We South Africans are proud that our communication has
reached the moon and we have confidence in our Minister of Communications.
Once more, siyaya! [we are on our way!] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members on my left, I know the
business before the House is very exciting, but I think you should reflect
on it a bit more quietly, if you do not mind.

Mr M WATERS: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, I would like to thank
the hon Dene Smuts for allocating a third of the DA speaking time to the
Post Office. This is in strong contrast to the pure neglect of the Post
Office by the ruling party. Despite my appeal at the beginning of the year
for the Post Office to be placed on the committee's yearly programme and
despite my further appeal to the chairperson in the form of a letter, the
Post Office has been ignored by the Portfolio Committee on Communications
this year.

The borrowing of R1 billion from the Postbank by the Post Office was
reported in the press. There is still no clarity on why the Post Office
needed the money, nor on how it intends to repay it. Of the R1,5 billion
subsidy announced late last year, R600 million was given to the Post Office
for the 2000-01 financial year. However, only R22 million went to the Post
Bank. Can the Minister clarify whether this was a form of repayment, or
alternatively the committee should call in the Post Office CEO to come and
explain himself.

The moving of the Postbank head office from Bloemfontein to Johannesburg
seems to have been shelved, as only 30 out of the 164 employees agreed to
relocate. Then in February this year we had the suspension of Mr Peter
Masemola, the Chief Operating Officer, and the postal regulator, Mrs Burara
Kakaza, while she was dealing with the tariff increases. I believe that Mrs
Kakaza is still suspended with full pay after three months, because the
department cannot find a chairperson to deal with the disciplinary hearing.
The taxpayers are being ripped off, yet again.

Then we had the debacle concerning the tariff increases which, according to
section 5(13) of the Post Office contract, limits any tariff increase to
that of CPI. However, the Post Office asked for higher-than-inflation
increases and the Minister ran roughshod over the very regulations which
had been put in place to protect the consumer from exploitation. The
increases amount to a declaration by the Minister that Government cares
very little for the poor, who mostly make use of the basic postal service
to communicate with their families.

Another breach of the contract was a stipulation that by 31 October last
year, the Post Office had to submit details of proposed tariff increases to
the Post Office regulator. However, this was only done on 6 December,
causing the tariff increases to become effective 21 days later and costing
the taxpayer a further R12 million in the process. Any one of the above
should have spurred any committee worth its salt into action. Sadly to say,
nothing was done.

However, the woes continue. Just last week two Post Office officials were
shot dead in a tragic incident in Bloemfontein. It appears that not even
basic security measures that are the norm in private banks are in place for
the protection of our staff, especially at month end when huge amounts of
money are changing hands. Also last week, another top official, Mr Jannie
Visagie, the Post Office's company secretary, was suspended. The DA would
like to know from the Minister in her reply why he was suspended and how
much keeping him suspended is costing the taxpayer.

The DA is also concerned about another relationship taking place. Mr
Radebe, while being a director of a Post Office subsidiary, is also a
director of a consultancy firm which has just been awarded a contract by
the Post Office to regulate the courier company. I would like the Minister
to elaborate on that as well in her reply.

I sincerely hope that the Minister will shed some light on this issue and
others that I have just raised. It seems that I am the only person
exercising an oversight role of the Post Office. It is high time the ANC
MPs started doing their job and earning their keep. [Applause.]

Ms N S MTSWENI: Chairperson, it is a pity that the member who has just left
the podium does not even attend committee meetings. He is therefore not
aware of what is happening in the committee. [Interjections.] He does not
know that today we afforded them 12 minutes in the postal services debate,
because we know that it is important. [Interjections.] They always howl
like that, even in the committee!

Sihlalo, Malunga wePalamende aqakathekileko, Malunga ahlezi phezulu,
ngiyathokoza bona ngibe nani namhlanjesi. Ilanga lana mhlanjesi lilanga
eliqakatheke khulu-khulu kwamambala ku-Telkom. I-Telkom lapha eSewula
Afrika igide yaqaleka. Nakuyingoma yona iyigide yezwakala. Ihlombe
lizwakele. (Translation of Ndebele paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, members of Parliament, members sitting in the gallery, I am
grateful that they are with us today. Today is an important day for Telkom,
because they have made their mark in South Africa. If it were a song I
would say they have sung it well; the applause has been heard.]

As we speak here today we are faced with exciting times in the area of
telecommunications. Only five months ago, the third mobile operator, Cell
C, was launched. We understand that they are doing remarkably well. In such
a short time, they have introduced exciting new packages and services for
their clients. Customers have welcomed this competition with a great deal
of enthusiasm. It is no wonder that Cell C has already signed up nearly
half a million subscribers. This is unprecedented. They are confident that
they will meet their target, which is to capture 20% of the market in the
next five years.

Moreover, this venture has already injected over $200 million into the
economy. It hopes to create 2 500 direct jobs and another 10 000 jobs as
they roll out their services. Furthermore, as we introduce more managed
liberalisation in the area of telecommunications, we are now on the eve of
licensing the second national operator to compete with Telkom.

The new Telecommunications Amendment Act of 2001 has many exciting spinoffs
both for South Africans as a whole and small business in particular. South
Africa is abuzz with excitement in anticipation of the new services and
facilities we are about to witness being rolled out. Telkom has, of course,
done a sterling job during their period of exclusivity over the last five
years. On behalf South Africa, I wish to express our sincere gratitude and
thanks to Telkom for their direct contribution to advancing our society and
for the delivery of services to millions of our people. They have met and
indeed exceeded the target of their universal service obligations.

The hon the Minister has already mentioned the figures, so I will not go
back to them. Notwithstanding these successes, I wish to bring to light a
few shortcomings that Telkom can avoid so as to deliver a better service to
their clientele.

I wish to highlight the following observations, both as a consumer and a
member of Parliament representing a rural constituency. Firstly, I want to
comment on Telkom's billing systems. In rural constituencies we do not have
infrastructure. We do not have roads and addresses as our compatriots in
urban and peri-urban areas do. The manner in which we receive mail is
rather disorganised and is not reminiscent of the modern technologies that
are currently available to uplift the plight of our people. I regret to
inform members that we go about our business with informal and disorganised
addresses, hence we have terrible problems whereby we often do not even
receive our mail. When we expect visitors, for example, we need to have
long-winded and complicated discussions to explain where we live. Otherwise
it becomes so complicated that one might have to resort to meeting one's
guests at the most convenient landmark.

I know that hon members from the rural areas can identify with this. As a
result of the confusion our so called address system creates, people in
rural areas often do not receive their telephone bills. Since they are not
aware of these bills, they do not settle them timeously. Considering these
circumstances, I feel that perhaps Telkom often acts too hastily in
disconnecting these phones. I feel that perhaps the rural clients should be
treated with more dignity. I therefore urge Telkom to change its method of
doing things.

The policy of the ANC is that South Africans should receive basic services.
In the same breath I appeal to the Department of Communications to
accelerate the roll-out of addresses. We do understand the infrastructural
difficulties the department must be faced with in rolling out these
services, but this is a basic need. Once our people have addresses, the
provision of other basic needs will be facilitated. They will be able to
receive their electricity, water and telephone bills. Their services will
no longer be terminated unnecessarily and hence they will not have to live
on the margins of society.

As hon members can see, the provision of addresses will, in the long run,
circumvent many of the problems that rural constituencies are faced with,
including the receipt of their Telkom accounts. Moreover, I am concerned
that Telkom's tariff increases will exacerbate the situation of those
people who had already been hard-pressed to afford the old tariffs.

Secondly, I feel it is a shame that when customers who have had their
services disconnected apply for reconnection, they must pay the very same
fee as customers who apply for a Telkom line for the first time. I feel
this is unfair, as it does not require quite as much labour to reconnect
these lines as to install them. I would urge Telkom to review the charges
for these services.
Ngizwa bonyana u-Telkom kukhona umthetho awufakileko wokobana abantu
nabazobhadela indleko zabo noma imali abayikolodako kwa-Telkom kufuneka
babe nemali elinani elithize ababekelwa ngu-Telkom. Manje ngithi ku-Telkom
lomthetho siyawemukela ngombana muhle khulu kwamambala. Begodu uzokwenza
bona iingebengu lezi ezisebenzisa imirhala yabanye abantu ngokungekho
emthethweni zibanjwe. Kodwana mina ngithi ku-Telkom ngalomthetho akazisanga
abantu ngendlela efaneleko. Ngibawa bona ngomuso abantu bakwa-Telkom bazise
abantu ngezinto ezitja abazilethako ngoba bangamakhasimende wabo. Lokho
bengukuqondise ku-Telkom. (Translation of Ndebele paragraph follows.)

[I have heard that Telkom has introduced a regulation that says that when
people come to pay their bills they need to have a certain sum of money as
stipulated by Telkom. I say to Telkom that we accept that regulation
because it will be helpful and will help in apprehending those who
fraudulently use other people's telephone lines. But I say to Telkom that
they did not properly inform people about it. I ask that in future Telkom
should inform people about any new services they introduce because these
people are their customers. I am directing this to Telkom. ]

Incidentally, I understand that there are many clients who have unresolved
disputes with Telkom with regard to the above-mentioned syndicates who have
abused their telephone lines. I would urge Telkom to please settle these
disputes, as their customers surely cannot be held responsible in
situations like these. May I suggest that Telkom further improve on their
customer care by establishing call centres which have the capability to
assist people in all the national languages.

Notwithstanding the above qualms, there is one particular thing I wish to
commend Telkom on, and that is the way in which they have prepared
themselves for the competition in the telecommunications environment. Over
the past two years Telkom has been remarkably innovative in introducing new
services to their customers. The introduction of the pre-paid fixed line,
for example, has been the first of its kind. This has brought telephony to
many South Africans who had not previously had good credit records to
qualify for a telephone.

With such creativity and innovation, I have no doubt at all that Telkom
will continue to fare well against competition. After all, as our hon
chairperson has indicated, this is what competition must ultimately bring
to our people, ie better and new services at lower or more affordable
prices.

Once again, I wish to thank Telkom for being such a good sport, and we wish
them all of the best for the future.

The mobile operators must specifically improve on their quality of services
where dropped calls are concerned. They have been allocated the 1800
spectrum, yet customers still experience an inordinate frequency of dropped
calls and terrible interferences, especially in rural areas. The mobile
operators must not only focus on providing services to the urban areas, but
should also expand into the rural areas.
Our committee chairperson will soon be holding public hearings regarding
consumer-related issues. We want to understand what problems consumers are
confronted with. Our mobile operators, though, have recognised that the
future of South Africa is to a great extent intertwined with that of the
African continent as a whole. Currently Vodacom, MTN, Dutch-based Mobile
Systems International Cellular Investments and Zimbabwe's Econet Wireless
are building up a formidable cluster of networks and are competing with
each other in a number of different countries. We wish both MTN and Vodacom
well in these initiatives, which are in line with Nepad. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Mr Chairperson, hon members, I would like
to thank members who have been in support of this budget and have also made
contributions that are very helpful to the department.

To the hon member Dene Smuts I would like to say that I recognise the fact
that she is indeed very preoccupied with Icasa. But we will have an
amendment to the Icasa Act and I hope that when that comes to the fore, the
issue of national interests, as well as the efficiency and the
strengthening of the regulator, will all be seen as one package, and not as
a selection of certain things from others. But it is a debate that we will
have, because it is very important for the telecommunications industry.

I would like to thank the chairperson and other members who have spoken
about the role that the department and the Ministry have played on the
African continent in particular, and in general on the development of
strategic relationships and programmes with the G8 Digital Opportunity Task
Force, ie the DOT Force, the Commonwealth Expert Group on Information
Technology and the UN ICT Task Force. The voice of South Africa is an
important one there and in the SADC region, with whom we must work in order
to be able to have harmonisation of our regulations and strategies, whether
these are for e-readiness or other e-strategies for business.

I would like to say to Mr Gorem, however, that IPO was delayed because the
markets were not very good. We cannot be expected to behave in a very
irresponsible manner about an asset that is actually very important.

I would like to thank Mr Carrim very much for making this House aware that
we do not have to always look to Government for driving projects. In this
particular case, I would like to thank the SABC and Multichoice for the
kind of investment in people they have made at Westbury, a community that
has been torn apart by violence, crime, drugs, etc. We have seen many young
people, through working with the church in that area, rehabilitating many
of those criminals or drug pushers and ensuring that they acquire skills in
the communication sector. Nine of those were trained by the SABC, four of
whom have been taken up by the SABC to work for them. They have been able
to build what is called outside broadcasting vans from the skills that they
have learnt. Through such inroads into such people, we give them back their
dignity and the capability to win back the respect of their communities.

With regard to the Post Office, as Mr Waters always seems to be pointing
out, it is important indeed that we exercise that oversight. But I am a bit
concerned about a number of investigations that we have done. I always seem
to be communicated with about this by Mr Waters. I said it before - en ek
sal dit weer sê [and I will say it again]:

O a bona, nna ke a fatafata. [You see, I have made some investigations.]

Dit kom van ver af. Dit het nie in 1994 begin nie. Dit het voor 1994 begin.
Daar waar ons krap, het lankal gejeuk, maar mense het vir ons gesê ons
moenie krap waar dit nie gejeuk het nie. [Applous.] Ons sal krap tot ons
die waarheid kry; die waarheid wat voor 1994 begin het, en ons sal daaroor
kom. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This has come a long way. It did not start in 1994. It started before
1994. The place where we are scratching has been itching for a long time,
but in the past people told us not to scratch in places which were not
itching. [Applause.] We will scratch until we get the truth; the truth that
started before 1994, and we will manage to find it.]

Clearly what is happening in the Post Office now - the suspensions that are
taking place - comes from far, but we will find the truth.

With regard to consultancies that have been said to be expensive, we were
told that we did not have the skills and that we must go and find people
outside, and so on. [Interjections.] We found that many lawyers, auditors,
experts, etc, have taken us for a ride. I am ready to give members that
information because, again, ...

... ons krap en ons sal dit ook kry. [... we are scratching, and we will
find it, too.]

So we will, to some extent, be able to explain where some of those losses
come from because, indeed, we have been taken for a ride. The Minister of
Finance is particularly interested in the results of such an investigation.
I would like to say we do call on our people - because of some of the
things that Mr Maziya has said - to look after the equipment and
installations that we have in our communities. Unless our own communities
can also protect the equipment and those installations, we will not be able
to go far with our task. Let us give the thieves no quarter. Let us, in the
memory of Steve Tshwete, go after those criminals.

I would like to say thanks to all the people that I may not have mentioned.
Somebody asked about promises that we made to Thinthana. We only keep to
the promises that we originally made to Thinthana. No other new promises
are being made. They are giving their support for the IPOs, because they
feel that after we had answered their questions when we met with them, they
were satisfied with those things that they were told were different. We
explained to them. So, we welcome that support from Thinthana for the IPO
process.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank a number of people that we
were not able to thank - they are the chairperson and all the members of
the communications committee - for the unwavering support we enjoyed as
they continually challenged us to do better. This includes, a number of
people from the opposition.

Re a leboga. [Thank you.]

We would also like to say that we hope that as this debate continues, we
will recognise the work that has been done to ensure that Nepad becomes a
reality. This month we will be launching the fibre cable around the African
continent, to which Telkom has made a great contribution. That will make it
possible for us to end the practice of Africans speaking to each other via
Europe. The launch of that cable will be something that we will welcome. I
would like to thank all the people who are here, my friends and colleagues,
for their support and for pushing us, making sure that we can sometimes
make the impossible possible. As to many of the young people who were
sitting up there in the gallery, I would like to thank them for inspiring
me and making me believe that the youth of this country can, indeed, take
this country forward.

Lastly, I would like to thank my extended family, many of whom were born in
the last few months, for their support and the smiles, especially the
little ones who remind me that their future also lies in my hands. So, as I
put this Budget Vote forward and ask for members' support, I think about
those because we owe them a very good future.

Tsela e telele, empa re tla fihla. [There is still a long way to go, but we
will get there.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 30 - Minerals and Energy:

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson and hon members, firstly,
I would like to congratulate our new chairperson. The new broom must sweep
clean and, maybe, give me extra time! I would also like to congratulate the
two colleagues who were appointed to the executive.

I stand here to support the Vote of the Department of Minerals and Energy.
Energy comprises approximately 15% of our GDP. The total electricity sales
in 2001 grew by 1,8% to 181 511 GWH. The total liquid fuel sales in 2001
grew by 0,3% to 20 934 million litres. These figures demonstrate the growth
of the South African economy and the importance of energy as a key driver
of our economy.

The integrated electrification programme remains a flagship of my
department. It constitutes our main vehicle for delivery of a better life
for all. Accordingly, the total number of connections in 2001 were 336 858,
of which 141 707 were installed in rural areas and 195 191 in urban areas.

We are installing connections throughout the country at a rate of almost
9 000 per day. [Applause.] The electrification programme has been
delivering above targets. In 2001 to 2002 there were 336 858 connections as
against target of 300 000 that we had set for ourselves. Real costs per
connections are also coming down at a rate of about 21/2% per annum. I
would like to say many thanks to Eskom, our implementing partner and agency
of note.

During 2002 to 2003 there will be at least 300 000 households, 700 schools
and 100 clinics that will be connected. This will be done at a cost of R950
million. This time we will emphasise integration with other infrastructure.

The integrated electrification programme is inclusive of grid and nongrid
energy. This ensures that nongrid customers who are generally poor and
rural are secured and catered for. A total of 34% remains unenergised in
the whole of South Africa. Rural areas are particularly costly and
difficult to electrify and, therefore, slow the process due to the long
distances from the national grid, low densities and small settlements. We
will need members to assist us in ensuring that we have the public's co-
operation and understanding that we need in this regard.

The NER has been working on regulations that will ensure that nongrid
concessionaires are well regulated in such a way that they provide a more
comprehensive service which is linked to the local economic needs of the
nongrid communities. Nongrid providers cannot be satisfied with only
providing power for lighting and cooking. We need power for economic
infrastructure in the first instance.

To prove that we can provide power for local economic development, we did a
pilot project in 2001 for the Hlulega Nature Reserve in the Eastern Cape.
An integrated approach resulted in a design consisting of energy, water
purification and telecommunications systems. The energy system will make
use of the renewable solar energy, water heaters and liquid petroleum gas.

This combination of energy carriers will result in an increase in energy
efficiency and is, at the same time, also linked to the productive
activities such as agriculture of a high-value gross. This is what we
expect from the energy providers in the nongrid areas over a period of
time.

We face the challenge and threats of crime in relation to electrification,
which is also a threat to safety. Rural electrification efforts are
undermined by vandalism and theft, especially that of solar panels.

Parents and community policing forums, especially in the rural areas, must
assist us and take responsibility for making sure that we stop this
mindless vandalism.

We need the hon members to stimulate a greater sense of ownership of this
infrastructure in their constituencies because it is quite critical, as
such actions make the cost of solar home systems prohibitively high and
expensive because theftproof gadgets have to be added into the cost. We
also need the hon members' help to make sure that the police co-operate
with us. Government is not going to tolerate this lawlessness and these
illegal connections. We are giving a stern warning to those thieves.
Customer frustrations should be dealt with by using proper channels which
exist everywhere in the system. We and Eskom will also not tolerate the
irresponsible behaviour that we witnessed recently in Soweto.

My last conversation with the late Comrade Steve Tshwete on our work was
about our plans to visit some of those areas which are worse affected by
this solar home system theft. Thangana said to me: When we go there ...

... siza kubaxelela, kwaye siza kubenza into. [... we will tell them and we
will do something about them.]

I would just like to say to him, wherever he is, that I still need him to
help me on this one. Comrade Charles and I would probably benefit from the
kind of stern warning that we can give to these thieves.

In May 2001 Cabinet approved the establishment of an EDI holding company
which will implement the restructuring of the electricity distribution
industry and ensure the establishment of the six regional electricity
distributors. The EDI will lead to a sustainable, well-governed and
affordable electricity market. It will give a stable industry to small and
large users. It will also assist us to manage the costs regarding the poor.
Of course, we have moved very far in that regard. We are in the process of
appointing the board and CEO of this EDI holding company.

While, in the new dispensation, we will move towards a cost-reflective
approach, this will still allow for cross-subsidies. Therefore, I want to
assure consumers out there, especially poor customers, that cost-
reflectivity does not mean that we are going to end the subsidies that are
so needed by poor customers. In the meantime, the EDI restructuring Bill
will provide the framework through which relevant officers and employees'
assets, liabilities, rights and obligations will be transferred to the RED.
We will continue our dialogue with organised labour on those issues that
they are still concerned about.

We are on schedule to start with the first RED in the year 2003. The
challenge of the future of Mossgas is now well behind us. This year, we
will formally launch our first state oil company, PetroSA, which will pay
dividends to Government without Government putting money into it as well as
not giving any guarantees. It is our intention that, over time, PetroSA
will be able to command a total of oil reserves of more than 100 million
barrels per day by 2014, mainly from the concessions that they are
targeting outside South Africa.

I also want to thank SFF board members and staff for the sterling work that
they have done regarding the tender that they have managed which was meant
to replace strategic stock. I would also like to congratulate them now that
the task is under way.

Last year, I promised the hon members that we would ensure that the
integrated energy plan makes significant progress. I am glad to let members
know that by July this year the committee will be able to debate a report
on the proposals on the integrated energy plan.

Why is this important? It is because this is a planning tool needed to make
critical choices and long-range planning about all our energy sources.
Energy is a strategic resource for which we should be able to plan for 50
years and beyond. That is what this process has enabled us to do. What it
has revealed to us is that South Africa does not have a choice of
disqualifying or deprioritising any of the energy sources that we have. It
has shown us that nuclear energy, coal and hydrocarbons will all play a
significant role in the future of South Africa for many many more years to
come. It has also enabled us to make appropriate plans to push higher the
integration of renewables in our energy mix. The Deputy Minister will say
more about that.

As far as natural gas is concerned, we are on track for the delivery of gas
from Mozambique. Two days ago, the two Presidents launched the gas pipeline
projects. As far as the gas is concerned, we are also investigating how it
can be brought to low-income communities for small and micro business along
its path. Our own state company, i-Gas, is involved in ensuring that it is
going to be possible that the benefits of bringing gas into South Africa
also accrue to small customers. Along the West Coast, we are progressing
through co-operating with Shell, Forest and Mvelaphanda in order to make
sure that the gas reserves that are coming from that part of our country
will also be integrated into our energy mix.

As far as free basic energy is concerned, we have six locations where we
are piloting. So far, over 9 550 households are benefiting from the free
basic energy pilots. Once we have finished the pilots, which is estimated
to be somewhere towards the end of September, we will be able to write a
comprehensive report and make realistic recommendations to Cabinet about
how we will be able to sustain this programme.

We have also taken steps to bring energy services, information, education
and tips for cost-savers closer to communities through our integrated
energy centres. That service is going to be well on track. In the next few
months we will be opening some of those centres. I would like to salute one
of our staff members, the late Pretty Javu, who died three weeks ago in a
car accident on her way to promote this programme. Sithi makalale kahle
uMamZakwe. [May she rest in peace.]

Hon members will remember that during 2001 I announced that we had signed
an empowerment charter with the oil industry. At the time of signing the
charter, blacks only owned 5,8% of the industry. At the end of 2001, nearly
14% of the industry was in the hands of black companies. We are now more
than halfway with this task. Sithi: Halala kuSapia naku-Amef! [We would
like to congratulate Sapia and Amef.] [Applause.] However, we still have a
long way to go. I am very anxious that we should achieve this 25% target
sooner than later. Therefore, I will be working intensively with the hon
members in order to make sure that we can achieve this.
In March this year we also launched an organisation of women in oil and
energy in order to provide an organised contingency of women who can become
involved in this industry. I still remain very unhappy with the
representation of women in this industry but I would like to congratulate
BP who, in their deal, have made it possible for a substantive group of
women to participate in the ownership of BP. I would like to congratulate
Shell, who recently signed a deal with Tepco. I would also like to urge the
other companies that I know are working on something to please bring the
something out. I cannot wait to hear from them.

I am establishing a monitoring and evaluation mechanism that will monitor
progress and evaluate partnership in consultation with the industry. I
thank the hon members for their suggestions and contributions. I will soon
appoint a compliance and monitoring advisory committee to advise me in the
application of these mechanisms which will administer a point system that
will ensure that we can reward those that are making progress and have
penalties for those who are not.
I want to say to the empowerment companies that they have a responsibility.
It is not enough for them to acquire stakes for themselves and then hate to
take greater responsibility for broad-based empowerment. If one wants to do
business with Government, one must know that there is a precondition which
is that one should be committed to the empowerment of others. Otherwise,
one should not bother doing business with us. [Applause.]

I would also like to say that it is important that empowerment companies
take responsibility in managing their affairs so that we do not have to
continuously hold their hands. It is important that they should take care
of and pay attention to the agreements that they sign so that we are not
put in an awkward position as Government and distance ourselves from deals
that are pseudo-empowerment. It is their responsibility to make sure that
they enrich themselves properly.

As an aspect of the roll-out of the charter, we have begun a process of
focusing on other aspects of the charter. In this case, we are developing a
supplier development programme in order to make sure that more achievements
can be realised in the area of empowerment.

I would like to thank the oil companies which sent their representatives on
a trip to the US where they went to study best practice on affirmative
procurement, with particular focus on the oil industry.

As the country has moved to update and modernise regulation in the energy
sector, the industries affected have had to endure many changes which most
were not comfortable with, and I would like to thank the industry for the
co-operation they have given to their respective regulatory authorities ...
Hey, I am thanking the industry, man ...

With regard to energy efficiency we have not done as much as we had hoped
we would by this time. We would be committing ourselves to a greater focus
in this area and I hope in our next budget we will be able to report the
ground which we had covered. I thank the industry again, especially the
intense users in the mining industry who have co-operated with Eskom in
order to make sure that we can move forward with this. Honourable members,
this is an important contribution and all of us can make a difference.

Mining has continued to play an important role in the national economy.
Provisional figures for the year 2001 indicate that mining contributed
R66,8 billion to the GDP, compared to R51,1 billion in the year 2000, which
is a 13% increase.

Hhayi, kungakuhle amalungu ake akushayele izandla lokho. [Could the hon
members give applause for that.]

This constitutes 7,5% of the GDP in the year 2001. There is still a lot of
potential for growth in the exploitation of minerals in the country,
especially where the country is ranked number one in terms of the reserves.

This is where the ``use it or lose it'' principle becomes critical. For
example, in manganese we own 80% of the reserves of the world, in chrome
76%, in PGMs 56% ... My staff said I should not say this because I say it
all the time. But I will say it anyway.

We do not necessarily mean that we want to deplete these reserves, but we
are highlighting the kind of resources that South Africa still has in this
sector. And although the gold mining industry has in the past shed more
jobs, it is not all gloom and doom, as the depreciation of the rand,
coupled with the mood swing towards seeing gold as an investment, meant
that some relief was provided for the industry, which is largely an exports
sector.

Thousands of jobs have been saved and shareholders have reported very good
earnings, especially compared to last year. In addition to South Africa's
huge potential for mineral exploitation, the mature mining industry has
created an innovative world-class mining technological sector.

There have also been great advances which we have made as South Africa and
African countries in the area of conflict diamonds. We will be ready at the
end of the year to launch the certificate within the record time set to us
by the UN General Assembly, the International Certification Scheme for
Rough Diamonds.

With regard to beneficiation we are also moving very fast. Before the the
end of this year we will bring to this Parliament a Bill on precious metals
which will address the issue of entry barriers into the area of
beneficiation.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Minister. Colleagues, if you
will lower your voices, you will allow the Minister to be able to proceed
without straining her voice.

The MINISTER: With regard to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Bill, this is a very important piece of legislation that will
address fundamental issues in the mining and mineral industry. The Bill
will facilitate the transformation of the industry in order to attract new
investment, entrench sustainable development and deal with the legacy of
migrant labour, promote security of tenure and a predictable investment
climate, legitimise a mine-specific social plan, and introduce the
dedicated use of royalties to communities affected by mining, including
labour-sending areas.

The Bill has been introduced in Parliament. The matter is now with
Parliament, where interested parties will be given an opportunity to voice
their concerns and provide inputs. As a department, we have listened and
incorporated very diverse views as far as we could. We have always
anticipated that in this Bill we may not reach full consensus, because the
issue is controversial. Not everybody got quite what they wanted and
therefore we all have to be content with what we have. We cannot as a
department or as a Ministry overrule state law advisers to give some of the
stakeholders what they want from this Bill. We are very pragmatic and we
are comfortable that what we have is sufficient consensus notwithstanding
the fact that we do not have total consensus.

We obviously cannot compromise the fundamental principles of the Bill and
we have to ensure that the key performance indicator of the Bill, which
includes, amongst others, significant change in the ownership profile, is
realised. In this regard we are working on a BE mining charter which is
currently being drafted by my department. This will be for the benefit of
both women and all other historically disadvantaged persons. This will be
the contribution of my department in the advancement of the Mbula agreement
that we reached with the industry. The charter will facilitate
transformation of the industry and we also call on the industry to be
proactive in taking their own initiative in relation to the BE, and I will
advise them to learn something from the the oil sector. I am sure that they
will be able to benefit if they consult and talk to the colleagues there.

The reality is that South Africa is one of the biggest mining economies in
the world but the ownership remains extremely exclusive. For example, one
white company holds 63% of South Africa's platinum reserves. In respect of
manganese, only two white companies hold 83% of the total reserves. In
respect of gold only two white companies hold 51% of the total reserves. In
respect of diamonds one white company controls 95% of South Africa's
production.

For a healthy and a robust democracy, this is not good for all of us and I
am sure that the industry will rise to the occasion. They need a paradigm
shift because this is just not sustainable and this is what the Bill has to
achieve. [Applause.]

I would like to assure those people who would have thought that in our
compromise we would not address, and that we would give up on, those
critical aspects of what the Bill needs to achieve, that ...

... asizokuthengisa, maqabane. [Ihlombe.] Iyafuneka inguquko. Asisoze
sathengisa ngelizwe loFaku, loShaka, loSikhukhuni neloMkabayi. [... we are
not going to sell, comrades. [Applause.] Transformation is necessary. We
will never sell the land of Faku, Shaka, Sikhukhuni and Mkabayi.]
In terms of the Bill an advisory board will also be established to provide
advice on a wide range of mineral and mining-related issues. I would like
to start the process of facilitating the nomination of the people that will
be appointed to this board. We will be making an announcement in the press
soon. This will enable all the concerned people to have a channel besides
the Minister to voice their concerns. This advisory board will have a
standing in law. But I want to emphasise that it is an advisory board. It
will not replace the executive.

We also, together with the industry, agreed that the `use it or lose it'
principle is critical and important, and because we have that common and
shared understanding, I would like to invite the industry to voluntarily
comply with those principles, even before the Bill becomes law. I invite
the companies to discuss their voluntary compliance with this with our
Director-General so that they can offload some of the properties which they
have which they know they will not use because they are rather too small
for them or which, for any other reason, do not feature anywhere in the
plans which they have. They do not have to wait for the law in order to
begin to do this and we look forward to their voluntary compliance.

As far as royalties are concerned, I would like to express my appreciation
to the Minister of Finance who has made it possible that all royalties,
which will be collected in the future, be used for community and rural
development. In that way we will be able to benefit the development of
mining communities and those communities that are affected by mining. This
means that in the future we will not have mining communities that just
evolve without any plan and strategy to ensure that we do not suffer the
negative effects that are caused by dependency on single economic
activities, which is why we have ghost towns today.

I would also like to indicate that my department intends to act swiftly and
decisively on crime. That is why we visited some of our offices yesterday
in the Northern Cape and North West in order to investigate alleged
corruption. [Applause.]  Whether the corruption is in the industry or is in
my department, we will not hesitate to undertake the necessary
investigation. In order to help reduce possibilities for corruption I would
like to announce that in future the collection of royalties for mining will
be done by Sars. Uzobafumana uPravin [Pravin will get them].

And again I thank the Minister of Finance for his co-operation in relation
to this.

A lot of work and challenges are facing us in the mining industry in
relation to the proper implementation of Nepad, and there are a number of
initiatives that are under way with regard to that. They include the
upgrading of the geoscientific information of Africa; the promotion of
mineral beneficiation and the production of high-value mineral products to
address infrastructural and agricultural needs; and the harmonisation of
the mining policy.

We again thank Eskom for its role in the development of energy
infrastructure on the continent. We also thank our geoscience council,
Mintek and PetroSA for the work that they are doing in this regard. The
geoscience council is already operating in 40 African countries, where they
provide a quality service.

In the World Summit on Sustainable Development Conference both minerals and
energy will feature very highly, especially energy, and there are a lot of
preparations that are under way in that regard.

I would like to announce that IDC has come forward to be the first investor
in the establishment of the Bakubung Fund which will be set up to finance
junior mining to ensure that our junior miners and new entrants have a
reliable source to which to present their viable application.

On mining and beneficiation projects, IDC's Strategic Business Unit has
already made investments totalling R1 billion, which generated R2,5 billion
in exports and created 2 500 jobs. We would like to encourage IDC to
continue with this.

The Deputy Minister will address mine health and safety issues. Suffice for
me to say that even though we have seen a decline in the type of accidents
that we have had, we are not happy, especially in the year 2001 with the
slight increase in the avoidable accidents that we saw in both platinum and
gold mines. We would like to congratulate the coal industry on having
contributed significantly to reducing the accidents.

I would also like to highlight the fact that we are working on a skills
plan which was developed and is already registered with the Public
Service's Seta, where our department will in particular focus on the
critical skills for our industry. In June this year we should be able to
launch our master plan in that regard.

Our budget for petrol - the Deputy Minister is an expert on that [Laughter]
- in 2001-02 was R1,245 billion, and in 2002-03 it will be R1,826 billion.
The bulk of that is for electrification. In fact, 52% of our budget goes to
electrification. We are a department that has a very tight budget. We,
certainly, can do much more than what we are doing now, especially in the
area of job creation, fast-tracking electrification and stimulating greater
beneficiation at the grassroots level. But we will continue to talk nicely
to the Treasury in order to make sure that we can, hopefully - during the
course of the year, when there will be an appropriation - benefit from the
generosity of the Minister of Finance.

I would like to thank all my very active and able staff members and senior
managers in the Department of Minerals and Energy. I also thank the staff
in the Ministry and my family for their support, and the portfolio
committee for being so dependable and supportive. I would also like to
thank a colleague, Almorie Maule, who used to be the CEO of Engen, for the
sterling work that she did during that time. I just want to let her know
that she is going to work very hard, because we still need her talents in
the industry. We also welcome the new CEO of Engen. [Applause.]

Mr T R MOFOKENG: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister, hon
members, since this is my first time speaking as the Chairperson of the
Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Energy, I would like to pay tribute to
my predecessor, Duma Nkosi. I have taken over as chairperson at an exciting
and challenging time.

Both the current Minister and her predecessor have worked very hard in the
last few years to develop appropriate and effective post-apartheid policy
frameworks in the minerals and energy sector. This year will see the
implementation of many of these policies. Amongst other landmarks are a
comprehensive post-apartheid framework for the governance of the mining
sector which will be legislated, further unlocking the mineral wealth of
the country for the benefit of all, while benefiting local communities,
boosting black economic empowerment and protecting the environment.

The restructuring of the electricity supply and distribution will begin in
earnest after a landmark agreement between stakeholders and Government. The
consolidation of the state's oil industry assets resulted in one integrated
company known as PetroSA.

Astonishingly, rapid progress continues in black empowerment in the oil
industry. The establishment of a post-apartheid regulatory framework for
the oil industry continues with the establishment of a petroleum pipelines
regulator and the formalisation of the regulation of the downstream
petroleum industry.

Service delivery continues as thousands more households are electrified in
urban and rural areas, and initiatives are taken in relation to paraffin
safety and price, LPG and low-smoke coal. The first-ever bulk renewable
project in South Africa, the Darling Wind Farm, got off the ground.

Both the Minister and the Department of Minerals and Energy should be
congratulated on these achievements. The legislature, and particularly
Parliament's portfolio committee, will play a significant part in these
developments this year. As has been referred to by the Minister and will be
by my colleagues, we have just received the final draft of the Minerals and
Petroleum Resources Development Bill.

I note, in this morning's Business Day, that the Chamber of Mines still
opposes aspects of the Bill. We hope that in the committee they will share
our vision of an equitable, sustainable and efficient post-apartheid mining
industry, and that they will eventually withdraw their objections. That is
the appeal that I would put forward to them.

I think that clearly we should really ask ourselves lots of questions as to
whether the Bill will really change the face of the mining industry or
whether the industry itself can change that situation. I think it is very
important that we should look at those fields. The regulatory regime we are
proposing is a world-class regime, and we will not betray the many ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Colleagues on my left, would
you please converse in subdued tones, in order that the speaker can make
progress.

Mr T R MOFOKENG: Chairperson, we will not betray the many for the sake of
the few.

Likewise, the portfolio committee expects to see two Bills tabled relating
to the electricity industry. The first is the Electricity Supply Industry
Regulatory Bill, which will establish the basis for the regulation and
restructuring of the electricity supply industry. The current national
electricity regulator is established in terms of outdated apartheid-era
legislation.

More significantly for service delivery is the Bill pertaining to the
reorganisation of the electricity distribution industry, which will, once
and for all, disentangle and put the industry on a sound financial footing
and establish universal principles for tariffs. Households can only benefit
from this.
The final area in which we are expecting legislation this year is the
liquid fuel sector. The Petroleum Products Amendment Bill will effectively
transfer the responsibility for regulating the downstream oil industry from
private oil companies to the state. The complex web of apartheid-era
voluntary agreements among industry players will be replaced by a
transparent system of regulations based in the Department of Minerals and
Energy. This will help promote transparency and competition, and level the
playing fields for the new entrants.

The Petroleum Pipelines Bill will achieve similar goals in the pipeline
industry. By setting up an independent regulator, the Bill will benefit
consumers by curbing excessive pipelines charges that have inflated petrol
and diesel prices in the past and placed an unreasonable burden on our
roads.

Coming to the department's budget, one concern that we must voice about
that, especially in the light of the above upcoming legislation, is the
concern about capacity. It is evident that the workload of the department
has increased enormously, but unfortunately each staff complement has not.
Prior to the inception of the GNU in 1994, the department had 1008
permanent posts. Restructuring and rationalisation in 1995 and 1996 reduced
the total number of posts to only 667. That is shocking.

The focus and functions of the department have now been revised and
expanded to include activities that previously did not fall within its
original mandate. The current organisational structure provides for only
814 posts, which is totally inadequate to address the aforementioned
priorities and the implementation of the new legislation, as mentioned
earlier in my speech.

The creation of 269 additional posts implies that the department will have
a total number of 1083, an increase of only 73 posts if compared to the
total staff complement prior to the inception of the GNU in 1994. However,
very few of these posts can be filled in the next three years. The
department requested a total of R72 million to fund these posts, but only
R10 million was allocated for the 2002-03 financial year, R15 million for
2003-04 and R20 million for 2004-05.

In the 2002-03 financial year, of the 269 posts, only eight senior and 15
middle, junior or office or clerk posts will be funded. This implies that
service delivery, as well as effective regulation of the minerals and
energy sectors, will be hampered because of lack of capacity. Given the
importance of the mineral and energy sectors to the South African economy
... [Time expired.][Applause.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Mr Chairman, first of all, within the time available I
will be focusing my attention on three areas ... [Interjections.] There are
other areas which are pockets of excellence in the department, and which I
would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to. But there are areas which I
do feel that I need to bring to the attention of the Minister and ask
certain questions.

The first concerns the ever-escalating fuel price and the impact that this
has on all South Africans in terms of a higher cost of living in general,
and higher food prices in particular. I note that a task team has been
appointed by the Minister, which is indicative of the fact that there is
going to be a possibility of price adjustments being done on a less regular
basis, with Government effectively absorbing the implications of a volatile
market. I think this needs to be looked at.

There are, however, other measures that the DA would urge the Government to
consider as a matter of urgency.

Firstly, Government needs to consider giving urgent interim relief to
consumers by reviewing all taxes and duties imposed by Government with a
view to providing interim concessions to consumers. Government tax and
duties currently compose about 30% of the fuel price. While this percentage
is relatively low by European standards, it is on the high side with
respect to successful emerging markets. Secondly, Government needs to
urgently speed up its liberalisation of the liquid fuels industry in order
to promote greater efficiency and more competition in the industry.

The second question which I wish to raise concerns the Central Energy Fund,
and more specifically the Strategic Fuel Fund. The Minister will be aware -
and I think she mentioned it - of recent articles in the press concerning
the recent oil deal the SFF struck with Imvume Resources, a black
empowerment company. The deal, worth $1 million, was to replenish our
strategic fuel stocks with 4 million barrels of crude oil.

The first question that has to be raised concerns the reason for Imvume
Resources being declared the successful bidder. Imvume, a black empowerment
company formed just over a year ago, has no asset base and little or no
experience. Now, I wish to emphasise - and the Minister must take note of
this - that the DA is in favour of black empowerment. But it has to be
genuine black empowerment, not enrichment.

What was Imvume's added value as far as that deal was concerned? Indeed,
why was it necessary at all for a deal to be made through a middleman in
South Africa? Why, indeed, was it necessary to deal through any middleman?
Why did the Strategic Fuel Fund not source South Africa's oil requirement
directly from an oil-producing country? We are advised by the CEO of the
SFF that the first tranche of nearly 2 million barrels was bought from Iraq
via Slavneft, a Russian-based company. Slavneft sold to Glencor, which in
turn sold to Imvume, which in turn sold to the SFF.

The obvious question has to be: What were the commissions paid to each
intermediary company, all adding to the cost or at the expense of the South
African taxpayer? Why did the tender call for specifically Iraqi Basrah
Light? Why was the tender so specific? There was no demonstrable need for
this quality crude. On the contrary, it is not a product normally processed
by our refiners.

The overall impression that one gains is that this was a back-to-back deal,
and that the tender was created to suit oil already procured by Glencor,
Imvume's international trading partner. If this is true, it severely
compromises the tender process and casts once again a serious question mark
over the dealings of the Strategic Fuel Fund.

The third area which I wish to focus on has achieved the status of a tragic
comedy, and that is the SA Diamond Board. The Minister is aware that over
the years I have asked many questions regarding this body. We have had
problems regarding the appointment of the Government Diamond Valuator; the
court cases regarding the precise scope of his contract; problems regarding
corporate governance on the board, which led to the Taljaard task team
which made various recommendations; and the reconstruction of the board and
the appointment of a new chairman, whom I must say is a great improvement
on the previous one. But still problems persist.

The latest saga, referred to in Diamond Intelligence Briefs, a prestigious
and authoritative international magazine read worldwide by the diamond
industry, is the action taken by the CEO of the diamond board, which
brought the industry to a virtual standstill recently by prescribing what
were widely considered to be unreasonable new procedures regarding the
import and export of rough and polished stones. The whole process of import
and export has virtually trickled down to nothing.

As a result, three different interdicts against the CEO and the diamond
board were launched and were all successful, the board not even defending
itself, as a result of which costs were awarded against the board. I am
reliably informed that the board may well now face further claims from
traders for loss of revenue, this all adding to the board's already highly
precarious financial position.

The diamond board, we know, hovers on the verge of bankruptcy. The
Government Diamond Valuator has gone to court to get some R1,5 million
backpay, and has also put a freeze on the diamond board's assets. Word has
it that the phones last month were at one point disconnected for a week
because of nonpayment, and office rental is three months in arrears - all
the problems, frankly, leading back to the CEO. The Minister will recall
that he was requested by the board last year to start disciplinary
proceedings against the CEO on the basis of lack of corporate governance.

Now, he was seconded to the department, much to the board's relief, and in
his absence the board returned to reasonable efficiency in its function.
Now the CEO is back, unwelcomed by the board, I might add, and so the
problems have returned. The question has to be asked of the Minister: How
long is she going to allow this sorrowful saga to persist? Quite clearly
the CEO is the problem, and the CEO has to be got rid of. Clearly South
Africa's international standing is being severely compromised, let alone
the efficient functioning of that board.

Finally, I wish to thank the director-general and his department for always
treating the DP with a good deal of courtesy and always being helpful in
respect of inquiries directed at his department. It is much appreciated.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, hon members,
firstly I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our
chairperson of the portfolio committee, Ronald Mofokeng, on his appointment
but also to congratulate the two hon members who were sworn in for Safety
and Security, and Home Affairs, both Nqakulas.

The Department of Minerals and Energy has come a long way. As time moves
forward from today towards tomorrow and yesterday becomes a distant memory,
our mining and energy industries are ever constant. They have played, and
will continue to play, a significant role in our economy, more importantly,
in the lives of our people, changing them for the better. For that we have
a reason to hope, to dream and to believe in the possibility of a different
world. The Minister has elaborated quite extensively on what this statement
means.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Colleagues, I have requested
now on numerous occasions that you co-operate, and that if you do wish to
continue your conversation, you do so in a subdued voice, but yet you
continue to speak. There is quite a lot of noise.

If you were to sit here, hon Ellis, you would hear the concentration of
noise from all directions. Now I would permit you to continue in subdued
voices, but clearly you cannot speak in a voice that distracts from the
main purpose of the main speaker. The Chairs, I think, have to protect the
main speaker. That is the position of Parliament. If you disagree, I will
be happy to hear you out. There are certain members that are offending more
than others. I would like to call on them, without naming them, please to
co-operate with the Chair.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Thank you, Chairperson. During 2001 we made great
strides in fulfilling our mandate. Therefore, it is a privilege for me to
share with hon members the progress we have made. Let me now elaborate on
some of our programmes.
In the area of mining health and safety, the mine industry's health and
safety record is as follows. Our safety record, I must say, is
disappointing in respect of the performance of the gold and platinum
sectors in particular. While occupational safety risks and the hot spots in
the industry are well known, the same quality of data is not available in
respect of occupational health. Profiling of occupational health risks is
in progress. Noise-induced hearing loss and respiratory hazards are a major
problem in this industry. Hence we expect the industry as a whole to co-
operate with us in minimising these incidences.

We have had many accidents in the mining industry. In 2001 the mining
inspectorate decided to institute inquiries into the major disasters for
which inquest inquiries are still outstanding. A magistrate or judge is
required to preside over these matters. Currently we are sitting with the
following situation.

The Hartebeesfontein inquiry is complete. The presiding inspector has
completed his section of the draft report. At this stage input is awaited
from the attorney who co-presided over the inquiry.

Sworn statements of witnesses to the Beatrix disaster of 2000 have been
recorded and the inquiry is scheduled to start in June. The inquiries into
Beatrix 2001 and Mponeng will start as soon as the Beatrix 2000 and
Hartebeesfontein inquiries have been completed. I must say, this is one
section with which we have major problems and we have not done very well.

At this point let me take hon members through the process of review of
health and safety in the mining sector. The Mining Inspectorate Review will
inform the initiative to integrate the safety inspectorate and will
examine, amongst other things, the enforcement capacity and appropriateness
of the approach of the inspectorate in respect of inspections, audits,
inquiries, inquest inquiries and profile of the industry, and the mining
sector's performance. I think the Minister has touched on this particular
point.

Integration in respect of occupational health diseases will take place as
follows. Currently we have a Cabinet decision, which was taken in 1999,
which calls for the integration and consolidation of the institutions and
laws regulating occupational health and safety. A draft policy document was
circulated to stakeholders for comment last year. The following concerns
specific to mining stakeholders have been taken into account: Making
provision for specialist inspectorates to serve hazardous sectors such as
mining; establishing mechanisms for securing adequate data; a phased-in
implementation process to ensure proper planning; and a manageable process
based on appropriate research.

On human resource development within mining health and safety, the overall
goal of the Mining Qualification Authority is to develop appropriate
knowledge and skills in the mining, minerals and jewellery sectors. In the
past year the MQA applied surpluses arising from the 10% levy fund
allocated to administration to the following priority areas: adult basic
education; R15,2 million for apprenticeships; quality management systems;
the accreditation of training service providers, which cost about R5
million; developing and piloting learning material, which cost about R10
million; and bursaries for scarce resources, for which R14,4 million was
allocated.

Further, when it comes to human resource development, we have spoken about
this in this Parliament, but we also want to give progress reports.

The Malaysian scholarship programme that was established during 1999 as
part of the South Africa-Malaysia bilateral agreement has thus far created
study opportunities for 28 South African students from historically
disadvantaged communities. They are currently registered for electrical,
mechanical and chemical engineering, as well as information technology
degrees at Petronas Technology University.

Eight additional scholarships have been offered to South Africa for the
2002 academic year and it is anticipated that the total number of
registered students will increase to 36. One also has to bear in mind that
in granting this scholarship, we try to target those communities who did
not have the privilege of going to university or cannot access skills which
are needed in the energy sector.

Regarding HIV/Aids, as we all know, people are a most fundamental and
valuable resource. We have a departmental HIV/Aids and related diseases
policy. It is currently being implemented with the Employee Assistance
Programme. Awareness campaigns are continuously conducted. The Centre for
Human Resource Development, with the help of an employee who lives openly
with HIV/Aids, is working in the department conducting counselling for its
staff infected or affected by HIV. This is in line with the policy of the
Department of Health.

In the mining industry a Tripartite Health and Safety Committee was
established and launched on 1 December 2001. Its terms of reference are to
be finalised soon. The committee's duty is to co-ordinate ways of
addressing the impact of HIV/Aids. A number of initiatives are under way at
various mines and in different regions. A Witbank project straddles the
mining and energy industry.

Regarding mineral development, the mining sector summit of February 2000
reached consensus in the implementation of five sector strategies for job
creation. A committee known as the Sector Partnership is in place and has
made considerable progress in implementing strategy. We expect that the
appointment of a programme manager with the necessary capacity will enhance
the implementation of the mining summit's outcome.

Since the mining summit's outcome, this is what has been benefited. We have
managed to save 5 000 potentially redundant jobs at mines in danger of
closure; established a social plan pilot project at Ergo; established a
developmental centre for retrenched mine workers in Lusikisiki; and secured
the opening of a mine technology training facility for small-scale mining
at Mintek. We are planning a mining week which is going to be held at
Nasrec from 30 September to 4 October. This is going to be the first of its
kind in South Africa. Therefore, we invite members to come and participate
in this mining week.

With regard to the small-scale mining sector, underdevelopment and
undercapitalisation due to the abundant light-scale opportunities already
characterise our mineral industry. However, this Government recognised the
potential to develop these previously underutilised resources and
introduced the National Small-Scale Mining Development Framework.

The constraints facing small-scale miners regarding access to resources and
information required an adjustment to the regulatory regime, in order to
create a conducive economic environment within which the sector can
flourish. These aspects are being addressed in the new Minerals and
Petroleum Resources Development Bill.

Despite constraints, we are already providing assistance to several small-
scale miners and the department has currently received 86 applicants for
assistance. Sixteen of these have been identified to have potential and
three are at an advanced stage of implementation at Eldorado in Mpumalanga,
Welverdiend Diamond Project in the North West and Osizweni in KwaZulu-
Natal.

I now turn to the department's approach to ensure that mining activities
are integrated into the local economic activities of the communities.
Eldorado has become one such pilot project in which mining exploration
activities have created 80 jobs in the mining sector. It is envisaged that
revenue from the mineral project will find other forms of economic activity
as part of an inclusive rural development initiative.

A number of agricultural opportunities have already been identified, and a
process is currently being put in place to involve the Department of
Agriculture in order to ensure an integrated approach to the development of
this rural area. Opportunities to develop an integrated project that
includes beneficiation and tourism are currently being explored.
Another advanced project is a brick-making project in KwaZulu-Natal in
which Corobrik has entered into a joint venture or partnership with the
community. The IDC has already committed funds towards the capitalisation
of the project. The required business skills and full ownership will be
transferred to the small-scale miners concerned over a period of two to
three years.

On the energy side, we need a balance between utilisation of energy
resources and environmental considerations to promote sustainable
development. I am convinced that renewable energy could play a small but
very important role in the development of a sustainable energy system. We
are currently drafting a White Paper on Renewable Energy which will
supplement the White Paper on Energy Policy of December 1998. The
Government policy on renewable energy is intended to provide focused
support for the development of renewable energy sources for both small and
large applications.

Large-scale renewable energy supply schemes can increase the diversity of
supply and minimise environmental impacts. Currently, other energy
carriers, such as coal and oil, do not include the cost of the
environmental externalities and, therefore, do not reflect their true cost
of consumption to our society. We cannot continue on a business-as-usual
basis. Polluting energy carriers will have to take the responsibility more
seriously by assisting in the establishment of renewable energy. They will
have a number of options. The draft White Paper proposes a renewable energy
fund administered by the Central Energy Fund. The fund will also be used to
mobilise financial resources and green financing. The draft paper also
proposes financial and fiscal incentives to stimulate the implementation of
renewable and energy-saving technologies.

With regard to the nuclear sector, in the next two months we will be
releasing the draft radioactive waste management policy and strategy for
public comment. This document has been a long time in preparation, but this
has allowed us enough time to cater for current developments. The
principles on which the draft policy is based are, we believe, acceptable
internationally.

I want to touch upon the area of human resource development in the energy
sector. We are pleased as a department that the various role-players in the
sector have managed to heed our call for the development of human resources
in nuclear-related fields. Last year the Schonland Centre at Wits
University produced 17 postgraduate diplomates in reactor engineering. The
University of the North West awarded 10 masters degrees in applied
radiation technology. A further 10 students are completing their final year
this year, and 17 are registered for the first year of the two-year masters
programme.

I am pleased to report that for this year, of the 15 candidates who have
registered for the postgraduate diploma in nuclear reactor engineering at
the Schonland Centre, eight are women. For this financial year we will also
be conducting a nuclear sector skills audit, which will lead to the
formulation of a national nuclear skills plan.
I also want to indicate that some of the hon members were talking about
petrol. I want to bring to their attention the fact that regarding petrol
pricing, which is of concern to all of us and which was used in the past,
we are in a process right now of getting three departments, the Department
of Trade and Industry, the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology and ourselves, to make sure that we are able to look at this
matter together. Cabinet has given us the go-ahead to continually find a
better mechanism or a better way of ensuring that our people might benefit
from a cost-effective petrol association. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr E J LUCAS: Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Minister of Minerals and
Energy, and hon members, the Minister, Deputy Minister and the Department
of Minerals and Energy are responsible for two of the largest sectors of
our national economy. The mining industry has, for more than a century,
formed the backbone of South Africa's economy, providing employment to
hundreds of thousands and generating billions in foreign exchange.
The energy industry forms another vital component of our economic success
and wellbeing. From the generation of comparatively cheap electricity for
industrial applications to the existing new developments in natural gas and
oil exploration, this sector is a major driver of economic growth.

Furthermore, the South African mining and energy sectors are the most
advanced on the African continent. Both these sectors are perfectly placed
to accelerate African development in line with the objectives of Nepad, and
will no doubt play a vital role in ensuring a better life for all Africans.
South Africa should indeed be proud to be able to call on these two world-
class industries for its own economic development and growth and that of
our continent which, in truth, has never really lived up to its full
potential.

The 2002-03 Minerals and Energy budget amounts to R1,825 billion, which is
R581 million more than the revised estimate for the 2001-02 financial year.
This overall increase is virtually entirely due to the increase of about
R350 million for the national electrification programme, and about R265
million to redeem the loans of the SA Nuclear Energy Corporation.

The IFP supports the increased allocation to the electrification programme
in the light of the vital role that the programme plays in improving the
lives of the poor. We are also thankful that the Government's commitments
with regard to the so-called nuclear loans are almost complete, with small
allocations to follow in 2003-04 and 2004-05. We also welcome the general
increases in the budget for administration, the promotion of mine health
and safety, minerals development and energy management.

I would now like to concentrate on a few issues of a general nature. Late
last year the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Energy had to bid
farewell to its long-serving chairperson, Mr Duma Nkosi. I, for one, was
saddened by the loss of such a highly talented, creative and objective
individual who chaired our committee with dignity and in a nonpartisan
manner that was a credit to participatory democracy. I would therefore like
to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Duma Nkosi for his innovation,
energy and commitment to the portfolio committee and to wish him well in
his new appointment.

At the same time I would like to welcome the hon Ronald Mofokeng as the new
chairperson of the portfolio committee. In the short time he has been
chairperson, Mr Mofokeng has already shown that he is committed to the
ideals of participatory democracy and co-operative governance. We look
forward to assisting him where we can.

Over the past few years the Department of Minerals and Energy has gone
through a difficult transformation and restructuring process. This process
was not without its complexities and problems, but I think that it would be
appropriate at this time to congratulate the director-general, his senior
management and all departmental officials on the progress they have made in
transforming the department into a vehicle that is well suited to service
delivery and to the promotion and regulation of the mining and energy
industries. The department has, among other things, been very successful in
utilising its internal capacity, and I want to encourage it to constantly
keep on developing the skills and capacity of its officials.

In addition, the DME has been very successful in empowering women within
the department, in the small-scale mining field and in rural development.
We congratulate them on this achievement and express the hope that their
excellent track record in this regard will be maintained.

Earlier this month South African consumers were dealt another heavy blow
with yet another increase in the retail price of petrol, diesel and
paraffin. Coming on top of the general food price increases, rising
inflation and higher interest rates, it must seem to many consumers that
there is simply no light at the end of the tunnel. We understand and accept
that the international crude oil price and the dollar-rand exchange rate
play vitally important roles in our local fuel prices, but there are other
factors that also influence the pump price, and it is within this
Government's power to investigate whether there is any possibility of
lightening the burden of the consumer.

It was recently announced that the department would launch another review
of the fuel price mechanism to determine whether it is still relevant,
considering all the variables that may have changed. A similar review was
conducted not too long ago, but no benefit accrued to the consumer. I
therefore want to call on the department to explore all possible avenues in
this review that could lead to lower prices or, at the very least, to lower
the price increases. Furthermore, I want to call on the department to
inform the public of what progress it is making with this review. The
public certainly deserves to know the facts.

The South African mining industry is also affected by the international
prices for gold, platinum, diamonds, coal and other minerals that are
exported. In this case the poor dollar-rand exchange rate works in our
favour, with gold-mining companies recently reporting massive increases in
earnings. This is indeed good news for the South African economy. Higher
earnings should guarantee that fewer jobs are lost, that new jobs may be
created and that capital investment continues unabated.

I believe that South Africa should take advantage of the higher
international mineral prices to the fullest extent possible. One of the
ways of doing this is to provide more incentives to the mining industry
while keeping in mind the characteristics of international commodity
markets and supply and demand factors.

Since 1994 the transformation of South Africa has in many instances been
accomplished by interventionist legislation emanating from this Parliament.
The 1996 Mine Health and Safety Act is a good example of this type of
legislation in the minerals and energy field.

A few short weeks ago the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill
was tabled in parliament. This Bill, when enacted, will dramatically alter
this South African mining landscape by transforming the so-called old-order
mining dispensation to fit in with the objectives of the new South Africa.
It has been a long road to bring the Bill to Parliament, starting in 1998
with the release of a White Paper. As the Bill aims to fundamentally change
the mining industries, it should be no surprise that it has elicited
vehement criticism from some quarters and fulsome praise from others.

It is now up to Parliament to make a final decision on striking a balance
between the interests of all concerned stakeholders. I want to congratulate
the Minister and the department on the extensive process of consultation
that they undertook with all stakeholders to finalise the draft of the Bill
now before Parliament. There will undoubtedly be further disagreements when
the portfolio committee considers a Bill, but at least every voice will
have been heard.

It is in this regard that I would like to conclude. It has come to my
attention that some stakeholders have expressed concern about the short
final period for detailed comment on the Bill. If one keeps in mind that
the final draft was tabled on 19 April and the comment period will close on
19 May, a total of just 19 working days, it appears to me that an extension
to the deadline for comment by 10 working days would not unnecessarily
delay the passing of the Bill. The portfolio committee will also be in a
much better position if it is in possession of stakeholders' detailed
comments when it considers the Bill.

I therefore want to urge the Minister to consider my proposal in a
favourable light.

Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Chairperson, Minister, Deputy Minister and hon members,
let me congratulate the Minister on her achievements of the past year,
which can be regarded as ANC achievements.

The ANC is fully supporting the Budget Vote speech because the ANC is
committed to service delivery to the poor. In today's debate I will focus
my speech on two issues, firstly the integrated national electrification
programme and electricity restructuring.

The ANC has done extremely well. Through the electrification programme more
than 2 million people in South Africa received electricity last year alone.
Here we are talking about rural communities, and this should be applauded,
of course. I am also happy to note that the budget allocation for the
electrification programme has been increased, and as the ANC we support the
hon the Minister on this programme.

[Recently, the hon the Minister visited the land of the Tubatse, where she
launched an electrification project, at the village of Tukakgomo. The Pedi
say: It is only by drinking the water that you quench your thirst, meaning
that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Seeing is believing! It is
truly amazing how access to electricity has improved the quality of life of
our people in the rural areas!
Still on the issue of electrification, the Deputy Minister, Ms Shabangu,
also went to Mathopestad to launch one of the electrification projects - so
that the quality of life of women may be improved. I say so because
nowadays, due to access to electricity, women no longer have get up at the
crack dawn to collect wood. Like everybody else, they just touch a switch.
[Applause.] They used to present a pitiable sight when they did not know
where to go and look for wood. Not any more. This means that the ANC really
wants to improve the quality of life of our people. The fruit of this
labour is there for all to see.]

The project that we are delivering also encompasses the free basic service
of 50 kilowatts per household per month. This makes electricity affordable
to people in the rural areas because there is a subsidy from the
department. The ANC policy on restructuring favours an integrated approach.
We need to balance commercial needs against developmental and social policy
objectives such as achieving universal access to energy services,
affordability, competitiveness of tariffs, diversification of energy
resources and security of supply.

The restructuring of this industry, I think, has been on the table for a
long time and we must acknowledge the progress made up to now, but we think
there is room for improvement. There is still much more that can be done on
this project.

The ANC would like to see our people receiving a better quality of supply
and service and a more financially vibrant and sustainable industry. We
also believe that accelerating this programme, especially in the rural
areas, will facilitate the development of home-based industries like
manufacturing and mining beneficiation.

To the ANC, providing energy sources should translate into an enhanced
quality of life of the people.

Gape ge re lebelela kua magaeng, re a tseba gore mohlakase wo re bego re o

[We all know that, in the rural areas, the electric cables that we used to
see were those that passed above our houses. We never had access to
electricity. We did not know what we had done wrong to make electricity
accessible to the white people only. However, the ANC has told us that we
too may have access to electricity because, first and foremost, we are
human beings. The important thing is that we are human beings and not
animals. To put it in plain English:]

We are not less human.

In conclusion, there are questions that still need to be answered: Are we
going to see any rollovers from this year's budget? What is the
departmental plan on that? Is there any financial support for women
involved in other mining projects, like ceramics? We know that our women
have wonderful hands.

Diatla tša bona ga di dutle; ba kgona go di šomiša. [Their hands do not
leak. They are capable of using them to good effect.]

In the integrated national electrification programme, our SMMEs include
women ...

Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[... because we know that, according to the intentions of our Government,
women are expected to also lend a hand because they too are businesspeople;
they are capable of doing business, just like the men.

Another issue that the Minister needs to look into is ...]

... how genuine is the BEE deal?

Gobane re a tseba gore matšatšing ano go na le seo go thwego ke ``Rent a
black woman''.

Mafelelong, ke rata gore ... (Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Because we know that, nowadays, there is something called: ``Rent-a-Black-
Woman''.

Finally, I would like to say ... ]

... if we diversify, because we always speak of an integrated energy supply
policy, how developed is our technology in other energy sources?

Re a nyaka go ka šomiša tše dingwe, efela ga re kwišiše gore di tlo re

[We really would like to use other energy sources, but the problem is that
we do not know how far they take us. Should I wish to use solar energy, how
far can I trust it? What can it do for me?

I would like the Minister to respond to these questions so that when we go
back to our constituencies we may be able to explain to our people and be
able to help them understand that they may use those things without any
fear. [Applause.]]

Prof I J MOHAMED: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister and hon
members, it is a pleasure for me to support, on behalf of the ANC, the
Budget Vote of the Department of Minerals and Energy. I congratulate Mr
Mofokeng on his appointment as chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on
Minerals and Energy.

I want to address the nuclear energy part of the DME Budget Vote. The
funding of the SA Nuclear Energy Corporation, Necsa, has always been a
point of controversy. Its funding absorbed about 60% of the DME Budget Vote
during the high point of the nuclear bomb project of the apartheid regime.
The ANC must be congratulated that it reduced this funding to 30% in 1998-
99, to 24% in 2000 and 20% in 2001. In 2002 it was reduced to 15%. The
transfer payments to Eskom in 2001 and 2002 are excluded from these
calculations.

The 15% of the DME Budget Vote spent on Necsa is still too much. This is
particularly so if we remember that the contribution, to the South African
electricity grid of Eskom, by the Koeberg nuclear station is 6,8%. Of
course, Necsa also produces radio isotopes and carries out decommissioning
and decontamination of nuclear installations and material, the storage of
nuclear waste and related regulatory functions, as well as fluorine
chemistry research. But this cannot justify the 15% share of the DME
budget.

Nuclear technology has made major contributions in medicine through
scanning techniques for cancer and other diseases, isotopes for internal
medical examinations such as cardiac and kidney problems, and the treatment
of blood for transfusion services in the face of the HIV/Aids concerns.

In the engineering and mining industries it has contributed in the
examination of steel structures, and in dealing with the problem of the
breakup and scattering of radiation-bearing ores and their decontamination.
In the food industries it is used for the sterilisation of food, which can
then be stored for very long periods. That is just a brief summary of some
of the things that we can expect from nuclear technology, as opposed to
nuclear energy.

On another level, there are major environmental problems with hydrocarbon
emissions from coal, gas and oil-fired power stations or even firewood
stoves. These energy sources must be severely limited, to stop a disastrous
environment excessively building up.

South Africa, in spite of large coal resources, has not excluded nuclear
energy as a possible energy source for the future. Dr Ben Ngubane, the
Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, said at the second
national nuclear conference in May 2001 that, and I quote:


  Cabinet has approved the spending of almost half a billion rand on a
  feasibility study to build the prototype of a Pebble Bed Modular Reactor,
  the PBMR. This is a bold decision considering the controversial nature of
  nuclear power both internationally and nationally.

Eskom believes that the PBMR can be built rapidly and economically, that
there is export potential and that it can be sited in strategic places to
power small towns or other installations. The nuclear waste could be stored
in sites such as Koeberg and moved to suitable repositories after at least
10 years.

Eskom owns 30% of equity in the PBMR, the Industrial Development
Corporation 25%, the British Nuclear Fuel 22,5%, Excellon of the USA 12,5%
and the remaining 10% is reserved for black economic empowerment.

The Department of Minerals and Energy has established a PBMR
interdepartmental co-ordinating committee to address matters relating to
the PBMR. The Minister of Minerals and Energy said in her opening address
to the same conference I just spoke about, and I quote:


  We also endeavour to consult widely on the PBMR and the option of nuclear
  power. Recently I led a delegation to France, the UK and Germany to
  conduct a fact-finding mission on nuclear energy and related aspects with
  special reference to Eskom's investigation into the PBMR, and with the
  general objective to inform the decision-making process and facilitate
  constructive debate with stakeholders and the possible expansion of
  nuclear-power-generation in South Africa.

The energy-management programme of the Department of Minerals and Energy
aims to develop and promote the optimal use of energy sources to support
growth, development and access. Its subprogramme of nuclear and renewables
promotes development of renewable energies. In its key outputs indicators
and targets for this subprogramme, it lists the development of the PBMR
strategy by 2004, but no inputs are given. So one is at a loss as to what
funds are allocated to this.

The overall budget for nuclear energy is R6,082 million, of which R5
million is for membership of the International Atomic Agency. Clearly, the
balance of R1,082 million cannot be enough for development of the PBMR
strategy and various study tours made abroad and the major problems with
nuclear waste, and the development of suitable heavy concrete buildings
which must be constructed to house the PBMR as well as spent fuel.

The Public Finance Management Act requires the Department of Minerals and
Energy to tell us exactly, one, what is being done about nuclear-spent fuel
and nuclear waste; two, what costs are involved; three, the personnel
engaged; and, four, if the work has been outsourced, to whom and at what
cost.

It is not enough to tell us that two draft policy documents have been
produced on the state of nuclear waste, and that a third is being prepared.
We need to know what the inputs are. We also need to know if the choice of
high-level waste is deep-level sites, with minimum risk of seismic eruption
for 3 000 or 4 000 years, or are we going to store in deep-rock storage
places with mechanical storing and retrieving, so that radioactive waste
could be retrieved when new technologies are available to reprocess these?

We need to know how we mean to convey such high-level material on congested
highways and from possibly many PBMR sites or other nuclear reaction if we
go this route. I want to expand further on this.

I want to say that Dr Ngubane, in his address to the second national
nuclear conference in May, stated that the problem facing the Department of
Minerals and Energy was very clear, and I quote:


  The subject of your conference, nuclear science and technology, probably
  does not strike a positive response to the majority of South Africans.
  This is for good reasons. Worldwide your subject is associated, in the
  popular mind, with nuclear weapons, secrecy, official lies, failed
  nuclear power systems, radioactive pollution and lack of transparency.
  You have to face the fact that the very positive benefits that flow from
  your skills and knowledge are not so familiar with the public and
  certainly get considerably less coverage. It will require extra openness,
  extra patience and extra persistence to succeed. Your conference is part
  of the long process required for public opinion to make rational,
  informed choices, and trusting the technical experts who seek this
  advice.

I fully agree with these sentiments, but I would like to add that there are
well-informed experts who dispute the Eskom estimate of the costs of the
PBMR and export possibilities and who share these views of the so-called
``popular mind''.

Mnr A H NEL: Voorsitter, ek wil graag van die geleentheid gebruik maak om
die Minister en haar departement geluk te wens met die veranderinge en die
verbeteringe aan die minerale ontwikkelingswetgewing. Die verbeteringe in
die wetgewing is meestal onderhandel in die onderhandelinge tussen die
departement en die mynindustrie. Myns insiens word die belange van die
grondeienaar nie genoegsaam uitgespel nie. Daar is ook ander aspekte van
die wetgewing wat verdere opheldering verg, soos byvoorbeeld die
oordraagbaarheid van die verskillende nuwe regte en die vergoedings- en die
onteieningsklousules. Ons sal hierdie sake opneem in die besprekings in die
komitee.

Ek wil graag 'n paar aangeleenthede rakende die petrolprys bespreek. Daar
is min gebeurtenisse in hierdie land wat elke inwoner so intens raak soos
'n verhoging van die petrolprys. Dit is nie net die petrol wat 'n mens in
jou voertuig gooi wat duurder word nie, dit laat ook die prys van die taxis
en die busse se fooie styg. 'n Mens se kos, en feitlik elke lewensbehoefte
word duurder. Elke keer as die petrolprys opgaan - en in die laaste tyd is
dit mos elke maand - gaan alle ander goedere en dienste se pryse op, maar
as die prys 'n slag daal, dan word niks, maar absoluut niks, goedkoper nie.
In die platteland, waar ek vandaan kom, gaan dit nog erger. Behalwe dat die
petrolprys in elk geval daar hoër is, kry die polisieman, die
staatsamptenaar, die klerk en die munisipale arbeider nie 'n sent meer as
sy kollega in die stad nie, maar hy betaal meer vir elke item. Dit help nie
'n mens vertel vir die mense petrol se prys is afhanklik van die rand-
dollar-wisselkoers en die prys van ruolie nie. Mense kry swaar, en hulle
wil hê daar moet iets gedoen word.

Wat is die oplossing? Eerstens sal die Minister en die industrie deeglik en
vinnig die prysbepalingsmeganisme van petrol onder oë moet neem, asook elke
komponent van die finale pompprys, sodat elke moontlike besparing wat
teweeg gebring kan word aan die verbruiker deurgegee word. Tweedens wil ek
graag die Minister se inisiatiewe vir die besparing van brandstof
verwelkom, en haar aanmoedig om hierdie aksie uit te brei. Pamflette met
bestuurstegnieke, en ander metodes om brandstof te bespaar, moet by elke
vulstasie beskikbaar wees. Hier kan die industrie ook help deur te sorg dat
dit uitgedeel word aan elke motoris en taxi-eienaar.

Derdens sal die Minister party van haar kollegas in die Kabinet moet
aanspreek oor hulle uitsprake, asook oor die dinge wat hulle nalaat om te
doen. As die petrolprys 'n funksie van die rand-dollar-wisselkoers en die
internasionale ruolieprys is, dan sal enige veranderinge in die waarde van
die rand of die olieprys die petrolprys beïnvloed.

Kom ek noem 'n paar voorbeelde. Dit lyk vir my dit is nie soseer die
gebeure in Zimbabwe wat 'n negatiewe invloed op die rand het nie, as
onbesonne uitsprake van senior Ministers en senior parlementslede wat
daardie gebeure wil legitimeer. Die konsekwensies en persepsies hiervan is
voor die hand liggend.

Kom ons neem verder die ongelukkige konfliksituasie in die Midde-Ooste, wat
die grondoorsaak is van die verhoging van die ruolieprys die afgelope tyd.
In plaas daarvan om ons mag en aansien as voorsitter van die onverbonde
lande te gebruik om druk te plaas op die Regering se vriende in die Midde-
Ooste, en op Amerika en Europa, om die strydende groepe om die
onderhandelingstafel te kry, kies ons kant in die konflik. Ons Regering is
'n voorstander van dialoog. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons President predik dit op
alle internasionale platforms, maar in die Midde-Oosterse kwessie verleng
ons die konflik deur ons optrede.

Die oorsake van die verhoging in die petrolprys is ingewikkeld en is
afhanklik van 'n klomp faktore, maar die gevolge van die verhoging is
eenvoudig: mense kry swaar. Hulle moet meer betaal vir feitlik alles. Dit
verhoog inflasie, met gevolglike druk vir hoër rentekoerse wat weer daartoe
lei dat mense hoër afbetalings moet maak op hulle huislenings.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Die totale negatiewe invloed wat verhoogde petrolpryse op
ons ekonomie het, kan in 'n groot mate teengewerk word deur optrede en
aksies van die Minister en haar kabinetskollegas.

Ons, en die kiesers daar buite, hou u dop. (Translation of Afrikaans speech
follows.)

[Mr A H NEL: Mr Chairman, I would like to take the opportunity to
congratulate the Minister and her department on the amendments and
improvements that were made to the mineral development legislation. The
improvements in the legislation were mostly negotiated during negotiations
between the department and the mining industry. In my view the interests of
the landowner are not adequately expounded. There are also other aspects of
the legislation that require further training, such as, for example, the
transferability of the different new rights and clauses in respect of
compensation and expropriation. We shall take up these matters during
discussions in the committee.

I would like to discuss a few issues relating to the petrol price. There
are few events in this country that affect each citizen as intensely as an
increase in the price of fuel. It is not only the petrol one puts into
one's vehicle that becomes more expensive, but it also causes the taxi and
bus fares to increase. One's food, and virtually each and every commodity
of life grows more expensive. Every time that the petrol price goes up -
and recently this has been every month - the prices of all the other goods
and services increase, but when the price comes down for a change, then
nothing, but nothing, becomes cheaper.

In the rural areas, where I come from, things are even worse. Apart from
the petrol price being higher there in any event, the policeman, the public
servant, the clerk or the municipal worker does not get a cent more than
his colleague in the city, but pays more for each item. It does not help
telling people that the price of petrol depends on the rand-dollar exchange
rate and the price of crude oil. People are suffering hardship, and they
want something to be done about it.

What is the solution? Firstly, the Minister and the industry will have to
take a thorough and expeditious look at the mechanism employed for
determining the price of petrol, as well as each component of the final
pump price, so that every possible saving that could be made is passed on
to the consumer.

Secondly, I would like to welcome the Minister's initiatives for the saving
of fuel, and encourage her to extend this action. Pamphlets with driving
techniques and other methods of saving fuel must be available at each
filling station. Here the industry could also help by ensuring that they
are distributed to each motorist and taxi owner.

Thirdly, the Minister will have to talk to some of her colleagues about
their statements, also concerning the things they neglect to do. If the
petrol price is a function of the rand-dollar exchange rate and the
international price of crude oil, then any changes in the value of the rand
or the price of oil will affect the price of petrol.

Allow me to mention a few examples. It seems to me as if it is not so much
events in Zimbabwe that have a negative effect on the rand, as ill-
considered statements by senior Ministers and senior members of Parliament
who wish to legitimise those occurrences. The consequences and perceptions
of this are obvious.

Let us furthermore take the unfortunate conflict situation in the Middle
East, which is the basic cause of the recent increase in the price of crude
oil. Instead of using our power and prestige as chair of the nonaligned
countries to put pressure on the Government's friends in the Middle East,
and on America and Europe, to get the warring groups round the negotiating
table, we take sides in the conflict. Our Government is an advocate of
dialogue. [Interjections.] Our President preaches this from every
international platform, but on the question of the Middle East we are
extending the conflict through our action.

The causes of the increase in the petrol price are complicated and depend
on a number of factors, but the consequences of the increase are simple:
People suffer hardship. They must pay more for virtually everything. It
raises inflation, with concomitant pressure for higher interest rates,
which in turn mean that people have to make higher payments on their
mortgage loans. [Interjections.] The totally negative effect that increased
petrol prices have on our economy can to a great degree be countered by
means of action on the part of the Minister and her colleagues in the
Cabinet. We, and the voters out there, are watching you.]

Mr S K LOUW: Chairperson, it is indeed an honour for me to participate in
this debate on the mineral and energy Budget Vote, which is politically led
by Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and Deputy Minister Susan Shabangu.

I am saying an excited ``yes'', because things are really moving in the
right direction, a direction that the ANC can be proud of, and a direction
that we can fully claim the ANC leads and takes full responsibility for and
is proud to account for in terms of delivery. The mandate, policy and
direction are critical issues to focus on, especially when one has to deal
with a structure which was previously dominated by white male capitalists.

Let me highlight some critical achievements in the oil industry, and the
radical paradigm shift the Minister took to empower the disadvantaged
groups, especially women, in the liquid fuel industry. The formation of
Woesa, Women in Oil and Energy in South Africa, has been one of the major
breakthroughs in the industry. The launch of Woesa is designed, therefore,
to facilitate women's participation in the oil and energy sector. This is a
platform to ensure that women take advantage of the opportunities offered
by the energy sector and are identified as one of the main drivers of
economic progress and development of black empowerment.

Women also need to ensure that we continue to liberalise our economy. They
have to take up major roles in the fuel industry, and remain in the driving
seat that will benefit growth from the 25% entrance minimum for the
historically disadvantaged groups. This is a massive opportunity for black
economic empowerment.

I want to address the other challenges and opportunities that our
Government, led by the ANC, is faced with. I want to focus on PetroSA,
which will be closely linked with the New Partnership for Africa's
Development programme, a vehicle that will embrace other major African
countries with mineral potential.

These resources can be utilised in the fight against poverty and be best
used for the beneficiation of disadvantaged groups on our continent.
Africa's strength lies in its mineral and natural resources, and PetroSA
will potentially play a key role in building a resource infrastructure in
South Africa and the rest of Africa. It is also this role that the ANC
plays in cementing the different resources to benefit our continent as a
major basis for development.

PetroSA's challenges are to integrate state assets in the oil and gas
sector. While the apartheid era policy on liquid fuels, especially Mossgas,
was focused on security at any price, the challenges that PetroSA faces is
to make these assets pay, and also to contribute to national and regional
development. PetroSA's upstream, so far, is looking at Angola and Gabone,
with Gabone looking extremely promising.

South Africa is well positioned to explore for oil in Africa. This will
boost the security of supplying oil for PetroSA and place it on a firm
footing commercially as an integrated oil and gas company.

It will also enable PetroSA to act as a hedge against fluctuating
international oil prices. Our country has long been used as a stepping
stone for other countries' economic growth, and it is about time we raised
our voices. The task team for PetroSA has also indicated that massive
improvements in efficiency are possible in the Mossgas plan without
significant investment.

We can look forward to a significant increase in revenue from the
optimisation of the refinery. West Coast gas means we will no longer shut
down Mossgas in 2008. Its production life can be extended until at least
2020. The Mossgas refinery is the only large-scale refinery in the world
that has implemented gas-to-liquid technology. This institution is
experienced in the technology, but another hindrance is the Sasol licensing
agreement, an apartheid agreement that places severe limits on its
commercial use, even though Sasol was a government-owned finance company
during the apartheid time.

Another major project is the Mozambique gas pipeline, which was launched on
Friday with major spin-offs as an alternative in energy supply. This is
also a project that will have to be embraced by Nepad.

Allow me to touch on very important issues in the mining sector. Exciting
information in the mining sector is that the Council for Geoscience has
completed a mineral-deposit map of the African continent, indicating 60 000
plus mineral deposits contained in the African soil. Geological maps for
Gabon, Sierra Leone and Morocco have been draughted, and another one is
currently being prepared for Mozambique. These are some of the achievements
that will benefit from the Nepad initiative.

This can be regarded as a cornerstone for mining and mineral development on
the continent and one of the major catalysts for the operationalisation of
Nepad. The map contains a complete overview of the opportunities for mega
projects and integrated resources. It will also assist investors in
identifying exploration targets, and Government in planning for physical
infrastructure.

Beneficiation relates to the department's concern that our mineral
resources are being exported in their raw state while they could be
beneficiated in our country, create more jobs and bring more forex. The
department has, amongst other initiatives, signed a memorandum of
understanding on geological exploration and mining with the Chinese
government. [Time expired.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, I want to focus on and confine myself to four
areas of the Budget Vote, namely transformation in the mining industry, the
demise of the Sasol gas pipeline, electricity distribution and, finally,
budget allocation and constraints.

It is gratifying to know that the Minister's commitment towards the rapid
addressing of historical imbalances in South African mineral wealth and the
redistribution of energy resources remains consistent in terms of policy-
making.

It is an indisputable fact that the system of mineral rights acquisition
and ownership in this country is a historical legacy bequeathed by both
colonialism and apartheid. It is also true that the introduction of pass
laws and other discriminatory pieces of legislation around 1872 and
subsequently the introduction of the Land Act during the apartheid era
effectively removed all land and mineral rights from the indigenous people
and restricted their movement, thus curtailing their economic activity and
reducing them to mere purveyors of cheap labour.

The Mining Rights Act of 1976, for example, consolidated various laws
regulating the mining industry and it became the golden law of the country
that no coloured person, no African, no Asiatic, no coloured American or
Chinaman may be a licence holder of mineral rights or may in any way be
connected with the diggings, but should only be allowed as a workman in the
service of whites.

The Minister's policy to rapidly address historical imbalances in South
Africa through equitable redistribution of energy and mineral resources in
order to eradicate the injustices of the past - which still manifest
themselves in the ownership patterns of the mineral industry - is
commendable and should therefore be welcomed by all South Africans.

On the question of the Mozambican Sasol gas pipeline, our Portfolio
Committee on Minerals and Energy visited the Temane gas fields in Pande, in
Mozambique towards the end of last year, after receiving an invitation from
Sasol. This honourable House subsequently passed the Gas Bill which has
today enabled the Mozambican government, the South African Government and
Sasol Petroleum International to finalise the agreement for the
construction of the 850km gas pipeline from Temane gas fields to Secunda in
Mpumalanga. This is great news for both South Africa and Mozambique in
terms of job creation and economic growth. The gas pipeline will, for the
first time in this country, compete with coal and create not less than 1
000 jobs.

On the question of budget allocations and constraints, it is unfortunate
that the budget allocation from the National Treasury was at least 25% less
than what was requested. The consequences of this funding shortfall will
be, inter alia, that the department will not be able to carry out the
legislation of nuclear waste management. The implementation of the Mineral
and Petroleum Resources Bill will also fail and this will negatively affect
economic growth and job creation as key objectives of the department. The
environmental legacy of the past will not be addressed, public
participation activities called for by the National Nuclear Regulator Act
will not be implemented; and there will be a failure to implement statutory
responsibilities, which will compromise investigations into major accidents
and disasters.

The Minister is otherwise succeeding in turning the idling mineral and
energy resources of this country into a potent weapon against poverty. The
only problem that should seriously be addressed is the continuous
escalation of the petrol price. The UDM supports the Bill and urges the hon
the Minister of Finance to accede to her budget request.

[Mr S J MONGWAKETSE: Chairperson, Minister, Deputy Minister, colleagues,
Director-General, senior officials in the department and South Africans,
today it is with great sadness in this respected legislature that we speak
without our colleague, our elder, a warrior and stalwart of politics, the
hon Steve Tshwete. As the ANC we will never disappoint him; we will
continue with his vision. May he rest in peace!]

The mineral and mining industry is a sunrise industry. Some of our people
would want us to believe that, due to the fact that the mineral and mining
industry exploits nonrenewable natural resources, this mainstay of the
economy is gasping its last breath. I wish to state emphatically that those
who belong to this school of thought are wrong.

Provisional figures released in March this year indicate a 1% increase in
the contribution of mining and quarrying to the GDP. While some years ago
one would cry about the demise of the gold industry, recent reports
indicate that this sector of the industry is bouncing back. There is a lot
of interest in our platinum, manganese and diamonds sector. Notwithstanding
the employment losses over the last decade, the mining and minerals
industry seems to show signs of a rebirth. This is a sure sign that it is
still a long time before the sun will set on this industry. This is indeed
a sunrise industry. I am sure that the sun will shine evermore on this
industry once the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill is
promulgated.

Those hon members who either flew or drove to Cape Town, however antimining
they might be, should remember that they either flew in or drove an item
made of minerals. Thus the saying: ``If it is not planted, it is mined.''

(Translation of Tswana paragraphs follows.)

[I want to touch on the point of black economic development. The ANC
Freedom Charter of 1912 is our anchor. It says that the wealth of this
country will be shared by its citizens equally. Every law that we as the
ANC draft is done with the Freedom Charter in mind.

I want to tell the Minister that we are thankful to see her fighting to
have economic equity among the black people of South Africa. We saw her
trying to bring about a minute improvement in the oil industry. I wish to
ask: What is the percentage in relation to the South African mines?]

Can the Minister tell us what the percentage of black economic empowerment
in the mining industry is? I listened very curiously when the Minister
showed the percentage of mining houses that have between 63% and 85% of the
reserves. I was really shocked, because in actual fact it means that black
economic empowerment is not going to be realised, because they are not
prepared to release mineral rights and share with us. [Interjections.]

The Minister has echoed the statement that before the Bill is promulgated,
these mining houses must at least compromise and say: ``Let us share.'' But
now it seems as if the Minister's cry is falling on deaf ears.
[Interjections.]

Bagaetsho, fa re dira melao, go aga go nna le selelo sa gore Tona o inaya
dithata tse dintsi. [When we draft the laws there is an outcry that the
Minister gives himself or herself a lot of powers.]

Every time, whenever we make laws, people exclaim that they are very
worried about the powers that the Minister is writing into those laws. I
know very well that, across the board, everybody is saying that these
Ministers are empowering themselves and have a lot of power. But in actual
fact the Ministers intend to correct the imbalances of the past 300 years.

But now at the present juncture, since 85% of mineral reserves are in the
hands of a few, when the mineral development Bill comes before the House I
will not compromise. We will give the Minister the power, so that she
should correct the imbalances. I am sorry, but I will not compromise.
[Applause.]

I will only compromise if the industry is able to listen. In actual fact,
this South Africa belongs to all of us and we must share its wealth. We
should do this without compromising. We belong to no other land but South
Africa.

Let me now deal with the rehabilitation of abandoned asbestos mines. Our
Constitution grants everyone the right to an environment that is not
harmful to their health or wellbeing, and to have the environment protected
for the benefit of present and future generations. It is within this
constitutional context that the department is engaged in the rehabilitation
of  abandoned mines in South Africa.

Since the inception in 1986 of the Asbestos Dams Rehabilitation Programmes
on asbestos mine dumps, the Government has spent around R80 million to
rehabilitate 56 asbestos dumps. There are still 150 dumps to be
rehabilitated from the mega budget of R21 million in the 2001-02 financial
year.

The department has spent around R19 million on the rehabilitation of
asbestos dumps. This is an indication that the Ministry is concerned about
the health implications of asbestos fibres. As members know, it is the
poorest of the poor who fall prey to flying asbestos fibres. These
rehabilitation works will continue under the current financial year and it
is important for us to highlight some of the successfully rehabilitated
areas.

Due to the rehabilitation works completed in the Northern Cape,
particularly in the Prieska area, in Glen Allen and Koegasbrug, the level
of asbestos fibre in the atmosphere in that area has been reduced from one
fibre per millimetre - the hazardous level that can cause asbestosis - to
less than 0,01 fibre per millimetre. Mpumalanga ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, although you are firing
on all cylinders, I am afraid that your time has expired! [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, our country has inherited an economic
system whose policy and strategy were designed with the deliberate and
systematic intention of maintaining and sustaining racial and private
ownership of productive and natural resources. That is what we have
inherited. To this end, the liquid fuel and mining industries are still
dominated by white-owned companies, and the Minister has referred to this.
Black companies that have entered these fields of economic activities have
not passed the 10% mark in market share. This state of affairs should not
be allowed to continue and is unacceptable.

Time and again we take pride in the fact that we have a world-class mining
industry, yet workers continue to experience health and safety hazards in
these mines.

Azapo believes that working people have a right to health and safety, free
from the assumption that there is harmony with the demands for capital
accumulation. These rights must be combined with recognition of the need to
provide workers with a living wage and to safeguard their immediate
livelihood within the industry.

Women in particular are super-exploited for two reasons. Firstly, their
work is still influenced by the gender ascriptive roles originating from
household fear. They are often tea ladies, floor cleaners, etc, and this
state of affairs must also be addressed. Secondly, they are paid less than
men on the basis of the roles that have been allocated to them historically
and which continue to be the roles that they are supposed to play in a new
society. The Department of Minerals and Energy has a responsibility,
therefore, to change these circumstances to which women are subjected.

Over the past two years, Eskom has been credited with having availed
electricity to rural communities. This is plausible. Whilst Azapo is
encouraged by this development, it is nonetheless not happy with the speed
at which the electrification process is moving.

Finally, Government should continue vigorously to provide favourable and
sustainable conditions for increasing empowerment opportunities within the
minerals and energy sphere. This empowerment should not benefit few
individuals, but it must benefit all.

Ms E NGALEKA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister and hon
members, in the 1960s Denmark was dependent mainly on imported energy
sources such as coal and oil. Enthusiasts, NGOs and entrepreneurs began to
investigate the possibility of generating energy from wind. Steeply rising
oil prices lent strong government support to this initiative and gradually
wind turbines began to appear in the country.

Initially, wind energy was very expensive and government protected the
industry through a number of measures, including obliging utilities to
purchase wind power at higher than market prices. Huge technological
advances were made in three decades and now, in the 21st century, the
Danish wind power industry is a model industry.

In Denmark, wind turbines can compete with fossil fuel power. They are
owned by thousands of small investors, creating thousands of entrepreneurs
and jobs.

Wind turbines are Denmark's biggest export industry, earning the country
billions of dollars in foreign exchange. Wind power is the fastest growing
source of electricity in the world. On some days, more than half of
Denmark's electricity comes from wind. The current Danish government aims
to boost wind power to half of Denmark's electricity generating capacity.
Government, researchers, entrepreneurs, engineers and civil society all
played significant roles in the economic miracle. Can we repeat this
experience in South Africa? Is it possible to establish a number of brand-
new energy industries here? Experience in the rest of the world tells us
that this is indeed possible, with a strong commitment from Government.
Last year the Government released a renewable energy strategy document, and
the Department of Minerals and Energy will be releasing a White Paper on
Renewable Energy later this year, indicating the current Government's
seriousness about renewable energy.

The strategy document outlines a number of exciting possibilities and
initiatives for South Africa. I will mention some of these briefly. South
Africa will soon have its own wind energy project in the form of the
Darling wind farm, which the Minister has designated as the lead project.
Hopefully, electricity will be flowing from Darling by the time of the
world summit.

The Government continues with its programme of off-grid electrification,
for which R60 million has been allocated this year. Thousands of rural
households are already benefiting from solar electricity.

In his Budget Speech, the Minister of Finance recognised the potential and
benefits of biodiesel, a clean-burning diesel produced from plant oils, by
granting tax relief to producers. An innovative group is planning to
produce biodiesel from nuts which grow in semi-arid areas, ideal for our
drought-stricken interior. This will potentially create thousands of jobs
in addition to cutting our import bill for crude oil and benefiting the
environment.

Solar water heating has massive potential for South Africa. We have the
best solar resources in the world and, best of all, solar water heating is
considerably cheaper than other forms of water heating. We could lead the
world in solar water heating for the industry. All these and more could
form the basis for new energy industries, as well as forming an important
part of Government's climate change strategy.

There are two problems with the strategy document as it is. The first
problem is that it is vague on support mechanisms for renewables. We need
definite support in the form of funding for research and development,
direct or indirect subsidies, tax incentives and other mechanisms, and
these need to be built into current and future regulatory frameworks. Some
of this support can come from international mechanisms such as the Combined
Development Mechanism. The second problem is lack of capacity in
Government. The DME has significant problems with capacity. This could be
partly remedied by the Minister's plan to hand some of these
responsibilities to the Central Energy Fund.

The same problems beset Government's energy efficiency strategy, which can
also potentially make a very valuable contribution to the economy and the
environment, as well as solving some of the energy problems of our
households. The Government's Integrated Energy Plan, as well as other
energy models, indicates that the best option to combat climate change is a
series of energy efficiency programmes combined with a programme of support
for renewable energy. We also have the option of developing the region's
renewable hydroelectric resources in line with the President's Nepad
initiatives. This might be the cheapest renewable energy option.

Experience in other countries has shown that energy efficiency has both
immediate and long-term benefits to individuals and the economy. This
experience also shows that we need a strong, independent agency to
implement a successful programme. Such a programme could cut the costs of
industry, cut our fuel costs and thus our transport costs and, equally
importantly, significantly cut the energy costs of poor households. An
extensive energy efficiency programme would also create jobs and have
considerable environmental benefits.

Energy efficiency and renewables at a household level hold immense benefits
for women. Solar electricity eliminates the need for candles and paraffin
for lighting and lowers the risk of fires, while energy-efficient housing
in a number of pilot projects has almost eliminated the need for heating,
thus saving rural women hours a day collecting firewood. One current DME
initiative is the dissemination of solar stoves in the Northern Cape, which
will also reduce the burden on women in rural areas and conserve scarce
wood resources.

The ANC is committed to exploring these exciting opportunities, and we will
support the Minister and the department in all their initiatives.

The ANC supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon fellow members and guests,
it is my privilege to speak on behalf of the DP and the Democratic Alliance
in this budget debate. Over the past year, we appeared to have made some
progress. The redrafting of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development
Bill is an improvement on the original version. The Act to convert Eskom
into a company will assist in the restructuring of the energy field. The
separation of the three aspects, ie generation, distribution and final
delivery, will allow for more flexibility.

Although in the briefings there appeared to be more questions than answers,
some progress has been made and a great deal of thought has obviously been
put in.

The gas industry received a major boost by the passing of the gas Bill and
the gas pipeline to be laid from the Temane field in Mozambique. Both of
these factors will be of great benefit to South Africa and Mozambique. We
would like to congratulate Sasol on their initiative and wish them luck in
the future operation of the pipeline. The investment in terms of today's
money values is some US$14 million.

The official launch of this project was last week. A negative is the ever-
increasing price of liquid fuels. The fuel price affects all aspects of our
economy, and other speakers have mentioned this at great length. It is
recognised that the major causes are the rand exchange rate and the rising
price of crude oil. The reregulation of liquid fuel, refining and
distribution is considered by many to be a possible solution, and we call
on the ANC Government to pursue this avenue with some haste.

It is recognised that the total deregulation of the fuel industry is
probably impossible and unwise as the Opec countries control the supply of
crude oil at source and could hold a country to ransom. The lack of any
visible progress in the preparation of the integrated energy plan called
for in the White Paper on energy is a disappointment.

We call on the ANC to please do something about this before we go any
further in restructuring the energy sector so that we have a plan to work
from and do not make decisions which may have to be reversed at some stage
in the future. In last year's Budget Speech I called for this to be
completed. My call was echoed by many other speakers, and the Minister
replied that this would receive some priority. It is encouraging to hear
from the Minister that July 2002 is D-day. [Interjections.]

The mining industry is sound and making good advances. Both gold and
platinum have seen an increase in the dollar price, and the drop in value
of the rand has helped the bottom line. Accidents in the mining industry
are still causing concern. The coal sector continues to lead the way in
reducing the accident rate. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon Mr J H Nash, ANC, is
the next speaker. [Applause.] Order! It seems, hon members, that the debate
on Minerals and Energy Affairs can never come to an end unless the hon Mr
Nash has his say. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, Mr Bell says, ``Do not liberalise.''
[Interjections.] Mr Davidson says ``Liberalise.'' [Laughter.] One can see
how confused the DP is. [Laughter.] But I really want to deal with Mr
Davidson today. [Interjections.]
There have been many unsubstantiated claims about strategic stock,
especially from Mr Davidson and the opposition benches. [Interjections.]
The purchase of Basrah Light, it is argued, has been a grade that is
sanctioned by the UN. [Interjections.]

A cursory glance at the UN Internet site gives the terms and conditions for
the purchase of Basrah Light as part of the UN oil-for-food programme. The
hon member wants to know about Basrah Light and why we are buying Basrah
Light. I am going to tell him. [Laughter.] The SFF has applied UN
conditions for the purchase of this crude oil. [Interjections.] This crude
oil is also currently underpriced due to the UN smart sanctions against
Iraq.

This underpricing is beneficial to South Africa and it demonstrates that an
economic decision was made with regard to this crude oil as strategic
stock. It should also be noted that the US is a large importer of this
crude oil through a US company called Bay Oil.

Basrah Light, if mixed with a secondary grade of strategic stock ...
[Interjections.] The hon member wants to know about Basrah Light: he should
just use his ears for a change. [Laughter.] Basrah Light, if mixed with a
secondary grade of strategic stock which was purchased, namely Bonny Light,
would give the country a refining barrel in accordance with current demand
patterns of a high white product yield. [Interjections.]

The mixing will also allow the reduction in sulphur levels within the
refining ... [Interjections.] I will read it again for the hon member. The
mixing will also allow for the reduction in sulphur levels without the
refiners investing in expensive hardware in a period that requires
emergency cover.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Order! Hon member, try and speak into the mike,
otherwise Hansard will have difficulty recording you! [Laughter.]

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, I do not need to speak to the rest. I need to
speak to educated men. [Laughter.] The grades purchased by the SFF are
commercially tradable, which is an added advantage. This is why the SFF had
Basrah Light and mixed it. Moreover, it has been argued that South African
refineries have not run Iraqi crude oil. [Interjections.] What did the hon
member read in the papers? [Laughter.] Those people who informed him must
inform him properly next time. [Laughter.]

Once again a cursory glance at the Sapia annual report of 2001 indicates
that in 1997 South Africa imported 943 000 metric tons of Iraqi crude oil.
In 1998 the country imported 413 000 metric tons and, again, in 1999 it
imported 137 000 metric tons. This year the country will be importing 4
million barrels of Basrah Light for strategic purposes. But the hon member
is asking why the SFF purchased Basrah Light. [Interjections.] The only
reason why Mr Davidson is complaining is because he does not like the
colour of the board of the SFF which was appointed by the Minister.
[Applause.] This is the only reason he turns around and asks why a company
that has been in existence for a year must get a contract. Where did he
ever hear of someone tendering and being requested to choose a company that
has 12 or 14 years of experience? The best tender gets it. Does he know why
he does not like it? The tender was won by another poor black company.
[Applause.] Blacks must not get these things, he seems to think. The only
reason he has complained about this is that he cannot see blacks entering
the market, and his thinking in this regard must change. [Applause.]
[Interjections.] My racism is pathetic, but the hon member cannot get rid
of his racism.

The IBLC pricing formula is beginning to feel its death pangs that
commenced with the change in the pricing formula of LPG. In the past, this
product was priced at Mogas 93 minus R10 a ton, and now it is going to be
priced at Mogas 93 minus R205 a ton.

This change in the pricing formula will bring much-needed relief to poor
households. This is what I am dealing with - the poorest of the poor. This
relief can only be felt at the grassroots level if the rest of the LPG
value chain is assessed in order to trim off the remaining fat on the
price. One must remember that last year I spoke on the fat of the oil
companies. Here once again, I say that the fat of the oil companies must be
given to the poorest of the poor. [Interjections.] Share! We are not saying
people must not make a profit, but that that profit must be shared and let
the poorest of the poor benefit. [Interjections.] That is what we are
saying. I cannot blame Mr Lee, because the only thing that he can write in
the papers is coconuts. [Laughter.]

In our meeting with the department, they denied that paraffin pricing was
linked to jet fuel pricing. At that point, I said I would come back to
prove that it was linked, because I am saying that one must not link jet
fuel with ordinary paraffin, which the poorest of the poor must use. [Time
expired.] [[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you rising on
a point of order? Members, please allow the hon member to make his point.

Mr F BHENGU: Chairperson, whilst the hon member Nash was addressing the
House, the hon member Davidson called the hon member Nash a racist. I would
like you to make a ruling on that, Chair.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Davidson, did you say that the
hon Nash was a racist? [Interjections.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Yes, Chairperson, absolutely. He called me a racist. I was
quite happy to call him a racist in return. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I did not hear the
hon Nash saying that you were a racist.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: The implication was ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Now what we need to do is to separate
the issues, the first issue being whether the hon member had alleged that
the hon Nash was racist.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Chairperson, I quite clearly said that.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: If you had, are you willing to
withdraw, hon member?

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Chairperson, I am happy to withdraw that and I
respectfully ask that you ask him to withdraw the implication ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, when you make a
withdrawal you do not qualify that withdrawal.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Chairperson, yes, I withdraw that but then I am asking you
to do the same ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, you may then raise your
second point. Yes, hon member?

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Chairperson, may I too then raise a point and ask if it is
parliamentary for that member, by implication, to call me a racist?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSSON OF COMMITTEES: As I said, I did not hear him. Let
me indicate to you that if the implication had been that someone is a
racist, the mere reference to someone by race is not racist. To be racist
one has to impugn the integrity or the standing of someone else. That would
then constitute racism. But if you have the impression that by implication
the hon member made statements that were racist, I am willing to look at
that and to rule again at a later stage.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Chairperson, might I respectfully ask you, Sir, to inspect
the record, because that gentleman there said, and it was more than by
implication ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member, I will
certainly do that and come back to the House.
The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, I would like to thank the
hon members for a very lively, robust and energising debate.

I would just like to add a few critical comments and additional information
that the Deputy Minister did not manage to share with the House. One of
those is that Cabinet recently approved the end of leaded petrol as from
2006. The 40% reduction of sulphur in diesel, which was implemented in
January this year, will be further reduced to 0,05% in 2006. Those who
worked with us to reach this decision are thanked by us and, of course,
there will be ongoing discussion because, to some extent, this is not an
easy decision to implement. We would therefore seek to continue to co-
operate with the industry in order to make that possible.

I would also like to highlight to members that very innovative measures
have been undertaken in Mintek in order to utilise the great technology
strength and research that we have. As a result, significant foreign
revenue is now being earned by Mintek in that respect and through the
investments that they have made in the promotion of small miners.

I would also like to say that regarding Eskom, it is urgent that it should
actively support the introduction of regulation of electricity in SADC and
beyond, as currently spearheaded by NER. We need Eskom to support and
promote the interests of the shareholder, and the policy of the South
African Government is about being a government utility.

There have been a lot of improvements in Necsa. The sales are up by 30% and
there is an investment in skills training. At present, Necsa is providing
training to 100 technikon students in mechanical and electrical
engineering. I just thought that I should highlight those issues. Of
course, NNR has made significant strides. One if its outstanding
initiatives, which is in any case an obligation, has been the emergency
simulation that it undertook this year when it demonstrated its capacity to
intervene in case of an emergency. It is currently involved in a number of
international protocols to which it contributes and it is also involved in
the promotion of training in this sector.

Regarding some of the questions and concerns that were raised by hon
members, I would like to say that I would not like to flog a dead horse.
The issue is that the SA Diamond Board is very much linked to the
legislation that we are trying to kill. I would not want to make the
shortcomings of the CEO of the diamond board a subject of a parliamentary
debate. There are processes that we are following up in order to address
that and, in due course, we will make an announcement. We will co-operate
with the board in order to arrive at a solution.

I want to assure the hon Davidson that we are concerned about the situation
in the diamond board. That is why we, ourselves, have taken active steps to
try and address the issue. But, I think that the CEO deserves privacy too.
We should not be discussing his conditions of service in the House.

On the issue of the SFF tender, I do not want to get into details because
we will be providing a written answer. We are not treating this as a
priority because it is just another ghost chase that Ian Davidson now and
again pops up in the House. We have perfectly valid and good answers in
that respect. Some of the hon members who spoke before had started to
address that issue. However, there will be a written answer which will be a
matter of public record and other members will be able to read it.

I am concerned about members of the opposition when they give an impression
that there is something magic and significant that the South African
Government and oil industry can do about the petrol price. They are
misleading the consumers and that is not fair. The price of petrol, by and
large, is influenced by the price of a barrel of crude oil at the source.
Any tinkering that we can do - which is something that we are looking at -
is actually minimal. Those members should not raise the hopes of people.
They should concentrate on some of the effective measures that people can
take in their lives because there is a lot of wastage. They must not
downplay some of the education that we are trying to promote which will
give people genuine relief, by giving people false hopes.

The opposition wants us to subsidise the price of petrol. South Africa is
in the middle in terms of what it charges for tax in relation to the petrol
price. At the top are countries such as France at about 70%, and we are in
the thirties. At the bottom are countries such as Zimbabwe and others. Do
those members want to stand in a queue with an empty ``spakpak''? There is
a course in this shortcut that they are pushing us to. We are a responsible
Government; we will not take popular decisions that will come back and
haunt us, finish and klaar! [Applause.]

As far as I am concerned, we are in the process of discussing measures by
which we can continuously try to improve. We are willing to hear them out,
but they should not abuse this platform and mislead the whole nation. I
think it is unfair and it is criminal. [Interjections.] On the issue of
rollovers that was also raised by one of the hon members, all of these
rollovers are actually accounted for in our budget. In reality we did not
have a rollover. In fact, we overspent, but the money was just committed.
Of course, if I had more time I would itemise it, but this answer will be
available.

On the issue of radioactive waste management, the polluter-pays principle
obtains also in the nuclear sector. There will be no issuing of a licence
to a generator without looking at all these measures and how this will be
paid for. As things stand now, Eskom does pay for its waste management at
Koeberg. We are not going to change those principles but we also heed the
caution that hon members are raising. That is why we will not take any
rushed decision on anything that has to do with the nuclear industry. We
also share the concern and the fear that the communities have.

On the issue of renewable technology and whether it is safe and reliable,
one of the reasons we do not have as much renewable energy in our energy
mix as hon members and I would like to have, is exactly because the
technology is not as advanced as we would like it to be. Research is being
undertaken, we are investing in it, and hopefully, over time, we will see
an increase. But right now we do not have all the answers that we need. I
must say it is heartwarming to know that today, in areas like deep rural
KwaZulu-Natal, we actually have more than a thousand households that are
using fuel cells. That is progress.

In areas such as Cofimvaba there are wind turbines. In areas such as
Lubisi, people are actually using wind turbines. The combination of the
skills that we have in the CSIR, and very soon in the Central Energy Fund,
which we are also mandating to get involved in this sector, will mean that
we will increase our capacity as a country to improve delivery in this
area, and of course Eskom has considerable investment in this area.

About the percentage of blacks who own companies in the mining industry, I
do not want to polarise the House, because I think we all know the answer.
I do not want to use this platform to bash the mining industry because we
actually want to win them over, so that they can take a responsible step.
We want to assist them to make sure that we can include, and increase the
participation of, black people, but, really, ownership by black people is
dismal. We all know that the challenge is for us not to flog the dead horse
but to assist in waking it up, so that we all have a bright future. As hon
members know, we in the ANC actually believe that South Africa belongs to
all those who work in it, black and white, and we think that in this
industry there is room for all. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, just before you
leave, in your closing comments regarding some of the statements, you said
they were unfair and criminal. May I request you to withdraw the word
``criminal''? You may say it is unfair and unfortunate, but because there
is total freedom of speech in Parliament, it cannot be criminal. I would
request you please to withdraw the word ``criminal''.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: I withdraw it, Chairperson. But some
of the ``skelms'' here must not be naughty. [Laughter.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, the hon the Minister referred to some of the
``skelms'' here ... [Interjections.] ... and that must refer to hon
members. May I ask you to ask the hon the Minister to withdraw that, Sir.
There are no ``skelms'' here, but only hon members.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I fully uphold the
argument that there are only hon members here. Again, I would like to
request the hon the Minister to withdraw the reference to ``skelms''.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Mr Chairperson, I withdraw. I will not
even call them ``hon skelms''. I withdraw unconditionally, because the
party has to begin.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon colleagues, you have been
working voluntary overtime, so thank you very much.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 20:30.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    First Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated 13
     March 2002:


     The Standing Commmittee on Public Accounts reports as follows:


     The Committee heard evidence from the Director-General and acting Chief
     Financial Officer of the Department of Justice and Constitutional
     Development on 14 November 2001 on the Reports of the Auditor-General
     on the Financial Statements of Vote 18 - Justice and Constitutional
     Development for the year ended 31 March 2001 and on the Statement of
     Monies in Trust (formerly Deposit Account) administered by the
     Department of Constitutional Development for the year ended 31 March
     2001.


     A.     Report on Financial Statements of Vote 18 - Justice and
         Constitutional Development for year ended 31 March 2001 (Part A,
         Annexure to RP 158/2001)


         In the Report under review, the Auditor-General withheld his
         opinion on the financial statements of the Department, and
         qualified his opinion on compliance by it with laws and
         regulations applicable to financial matters. This indicates a
         worsening in the financial management position from the previous
         year. It is with concern that the Committee wishes to report on
         the following specific areas:


         1. Expenditure [par 2.2.1(a)]


              The Committee was informed that the Department was unable to
              present supporting documentation as assurance for the validity
              of expenditure amounting to R7 million. In addition, a very
              serious capturing backlog existed regarding the financial
              management system resulting in uncertainty regarding the
              accuracy and completeness of the amounts included in the
              income statement and balance sheet. There was also
              overstatement of expenditure, as well as unrecorded
              expenditure.


              The Committee welcomed the Director-General's indication that
              the bulk of the backlogs would be cleared by the end of March
              2002. It was also learned that there was a serious backlog
              regarding the writing-up of books within the Department, and
              that a concerted effort was being made to correct the
              situation but that there was no indication when the task would
              be completed.


              The Committee expects progress would have been made by the end
              of the 2001-2002 financial year regarding the work of both
              task teams. The Committee recommends that the Director-General
              report thereon within a month of receipt of these
              recommendations. He should also provide a clear indication of
              how long it should take to fully correct the situation, as
              well as indicate the risks for delays and how such risks were
              being addressed.
         2. Internal control environment [par 2.2.1(g)]


              Internal controls are essential to any sound system of
              financial management, and fundamental to curbing fraud and
              corruption. The Committee was therefore very perturbed at the
              acknowledgement by the Chief Financial Officer that the
              Department was not in a position to provide assurance to
              Parliament of a proper internal control environment.


              The Committee wishes to point out that, owing to its
              stewardship of public monies, the Department cannot be allowed
              to compromise on internal controls. In addition, given the
              nature of its work, the Department of Justice should set an
              example with regard to a disciplined management environment.


              The Committee therefore recommends that the Director-General
              afford this matter the highest priority. The Committee has
              also written to the Chairpersons of the Portfolio Committees
              on Justice and Constitutional Development and on Finance
              highlighting areas of concern. The Director-General must
              continue to explore ways in which the Department can -


              *   reprioritise its budget in order to provide the human and
                  technical resources required to support a proper control
                  environment; and


              *   implement compensating controls in areas where separation
                  of duties is not feasible.


         3. Personnel expenditure [par 2.2.1(a)(I)]
              In the light of the personnel expenditure of the Department,
              totalling R1,6 billion, the Committee is very concerned about
              the various unexplained differences between the personnel and
              salary administration system and the financial management
              system. The extent of the various unexplained differences
              totalled R36,4 million.


              The Committee recommends that the result of the reconciliation
              exercise, as verified by the Department's internal auditors in
              November 2001 as well as by any other reconciliation results
              received subsequently, be reported to the Committee.


              The Committee also recommends that the Director-General report
              on the impact on financial management of the resources
              obtained through the "body shop" tender, and whether progress
              has been in line with performance targets set.


         4. Suspense accounts


              The Committee is concerned about the extensive use of the high-
              risk phenomena of suspense accounts in the Department - in
              March funds in suspense totalled approximately R657,4 million.
              A suspense account is used when no certainty has been reached
              with regard to the proper posting of certain transactions, and
              in the Committees experience is one of the worst ways for a
              department to manage its accounts.


              The Committee recommends that the Director-General resolve the
              systemic problems that may contribute to unnecessary use of
              suspense accounts and implement better discipline among senior
              management staff as regards the use of suspense accounts, and
              provide a regime under which it may be permissible.


         5. Leave credits


              The Committee was informed that a departmental task team would
              complete an audit of the leave records of the Department by
              December 2001.


              The Committee recommends that the Director-General report
              within a month of receipt of this resolution on the result of
              the audit and what corrective steps, if any, are to be
              implemented.


              Internal audit [par 3.7]


              The Committee was informed that the Director-General was in
              the process of assessing the capacity of the internal function
              required by section 38 of the Public Finance Management Act
              (PFMA).


              The Committee recommends that the Director-General report on
              the result of his assessment and indicate whether the contract
              of the firm of auditors currently insourced by the Department
              will be extended, and whether transfer of skills during the
              contract period so far had been adequate.


         6. Thefts and losses


              The Committee noted that during the year under review, losses
              written off amounted to R650,000, down from R2900,000 the
              previous year. However, a proper thefts and losses register
              did not exist and an annual stocktaking of inventory and
              equipment did not take place.


              The Committee recommends that the Director-General ensure that
              a proper thefts and losses register exist by the end of June
              2002. He should also ensure that a proper annual stocktaking,
              to which the external auditors will be invited, will be
              scheduled for the 2002-2003 financial year.


         7. Asset management


              The Committee noted that, with respect to asset management
              within the Department, a programme will be completed by the
              end of January 2002 that will address the proper management of
              classes of assets.


              The Committee recommends that the Auditor-General evaluate the
              aforementioned programme during the 2001-2002 audit and
              specifically report thereon.


         8. Training in financial management


              The Committee commends the Director-General for the extensive
              training interventions that staff members have been exposed
              to, especially training relating to the PFMA.


              The Committee recommends that the Director-General briefly
              report on the return on this investment by, inter alia,
              indicating the total cost of training for the year in
              question, as well as the impact the training has had on the
              performance of the staff members in question, for example by
              evaluating the performance of the staff concerned six months
              after the training intervention, to determine whether the
              training has the desired impact.


         9. Housing guarantees - general financial management capacity
              within Department [par 2.2.1(e)]


              A contingent liability of approximately R22,5 million exists
              with respect to housing guarantees. The Committee commends the
              Director-General on having completed the reconciliation
              between the housing guarantee register and the personnel and
              administration system. However, the Committee is concerned
              that the reconciled state will not be able to be sustained,
              given the staff shortages. The Committee noted that interviews
              in respect of all posts would be completed by the end of
              November 2001.


              The Committee recommends that the Director-General report -


              (a) as a matter of urgency on progress made with regard to the
                  filling of all vacancies for financial administrative
                  staff; and


              (b) on the adequacy of the performance of the Human Resources
                  Department in terms of industry benchmarks for the
                  filling of vacant posts.


         10.     Witness protection programme [par 3.3]


              The Committee welcomes the assurance by the Director-General
              that the necessary approval from the State Tender Board
              regarding alternative procurement measures would be obtained
              before the end of the 2001-2002 financial year.


              The Committee recommends that the detail of the arrangements
              with the State Tender Board be provided to the Auditor-General
              for evaluation during the 2001-2002 audit and for specific
              reporting thereon.


         11.     Donor funding [par 2.2.1(c)]


              The Committee took note of a number of shortcomings in the
              financial records in respect of foreign aid assistance.
              Weaknesses in project management were also identified.


              The Committee recommends that by the end of the financial year
              all the deficiencies should have been resolved to the
              satisfaction of the respective donors and the Auditor-General.


              The Committee shall await the report of the Auditor-General on
              the audits of the donor accounts for the last four years
              before making any further recommendations, including the R3,9
              million donor funds for which the Directorate of Special
              Operations is responsible.


         12.     National Directorate of Public Prosecutions: Unresolved
              matters pertaining to 1999-2000 financial year [par 3.8]


              Separate accountability was established for the Directorate of
              Special Operations in December 2000. The Committee took note
              of the following matters reported on by the Auditor-General:
              *   Some unauthorised expenditure amounting to R523 000
                  occurred, owing to non-compliance with tender board
                  procedures.


              *   During the external audit certain documentation was
                  unavailable to validate expenditure totalling R117 000.


              *   Donor funds to the amount of R3,9 million were not
                  administered in terms of prescribed procedure.


              The Committee notes with concern the non-compliance with the
              prescripts of the PFMA at the time of the establishment of the
              DSO and the resultant irregular expenditure, which the
              Committee will be reviewing in terms of the applicable legal
              framework.


              The Committee recommends that a submission be made by the
              Chief Executive Officer of the DSO, highlighting the financial
              accountability arrangements between the CEO of the DSO and the
              Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice within a month
              of receipt of these recommendations.


     B.     Report on Statement of Monies in Trust (formerly Deposit
         Account) administered by Department of Constitutional Development
         for year ended 31 March 2001 (Part B, Annexure to RP 158/2001)


         The Committee wishes to express its most serious concern about the
         position regarding the Monies in Trust accounts.


         The Committee recommends that the Director-General immediately
         report to it on the following matters:


         1. Whether the post of Chief Director requested to manage the
              account had been approved, and if so, when it would be filled.




         2. When the Justice Deposit Account System would be fully
              operational.


         3. What progress has been made with regard to automation of
              receipts and payments of monies in trust (including the
              possible involvement of the Post Office).

Report to be considered.

2.    Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on Study Tour to
     Singapore and to Sixth Biennial Australasian Council of Public Accounts
     Committees (ACPAC) Conference in Canberra, Australia, dated 13 November
     2001:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (the Committee) reports as
     follows:
     A.     Introduction


         The Committee, by invitation by the Office of the Auditor-General,
         attended the Sixth Biennial ACPAC Conference held in Canberra,
         Australia, from 4 to 6 February 2001. The tour to Australia
         included an overnight stop in Singapore, where the delegation held
         a brief meeting with their Deputy Auditor-General, Mr Teo Chee
         Khiang.


         The multiparty delegation consisted of Mr D Gumede (ANC), Mr P
         Gerber (ANC), Mr B G Bell (DP) and Ms B Marshoff (ANC), as well as
         Mr E Molefe, Committee Secretary.


     B.     Meeting in Singapore


         1. Purpose of meeting - briefing by Office of Auditor-General on:


              *   Mode of operation of the Public Accounts Committee in
                Singapore


              *   Relationship between the Office of the Auditor-General and
                the Public Accounts Committee


              *   Audit Committees in national departments


              *   Fight against corruption in public sector


              (a) Mode of operation of Public Accounts Committee


                  Singapore's public accounts committee consists of seven
                  members of Parliament. The Speaker of Parliament appoints
                  the chairperson of the committee. Although the ruling
                  party has a majority of more than 70%, the Standing
                  Orders of Parliament require a balanced representation
                  between government benches and the opposition benches.


                  The main task of the committee is to examine accounts
                  showing the appropriation of the sums granted by
                  Parliament to meet the public expenditure, and such
                  accounts laid before Parliament as the committee may
                  think fit, together with the Auditor-Generals' reports.


                  All committee meetings are closed and report becomes only
                  a public document when debated in Parliament.


                  The committee operates informally and there are no
                  standing rules governing it. Parliament provides
                  administrative service and researchers. The committee
                  shares researchers with other committees.


                  The committee's work is focused mainly on Auditor-
                  General's reports on state-owned companies. These reports
                  are detailed and are submitted individually, whilst a
                  summarised general report is prepared for departments.


                  The committee, however, is not precluded from requesting
                  a detailed report from such a department. This method of
                  reporting on the finances of the departments is the
                  result of the Audit Act, which prohibits the Auditor-
                  General from divulging any information uncovered when
                  auditing government departments, except to the President,
                  who is not a member of a political party but is elected
                  by popular vote.
                  The summarised report of the Auditor-General on
                  government departments normally concentrate on the
                  following:


                  *    Financial Audit
                    The Auditor-General evaluates proprietary, accuracy and
                    transactions.


                  *    Compliance Audit


                    The Auditor-General evaluates whether laws, regulations
                    and policies have been complied with.


                  *    Value-for-money Audit


                    The Auditor-General evaluates whether there is waste or
                    extravagance in the management and use of funds,
                    manpower and or other resources.
                  *    Programme Audit


                    The Auditor-General evaluates the desired results or
                    benefits set to measure performance and report on the
                    effectiveness of the programme.
              The Auditor-General must inform the President of any proposed
              transaction by the government that is likely to draw on the
              reserves of the government not accumulated by it during its
              term of office. This is the result of an Act of Parliament,
              which precludes a new government from using the reserves
              accumulated by a previous government.


              The committee has the power to summon the Prime Minister to
              appear before it. In practice, the Permanent Secretary, a
              political appointee, is the one summoned by the committee.


              (b) Relationship with Office of Auditor-General


                  There is no statute or regulations that require a close
                  working relationship between the Auditor-General's office
                  and the public accounts committee.
                  The officials in the Office of the Auditor-General are
                  neither part of the preparatory work performed before the
                  hearing nor part of the  drafting of committee reports
                  and resolutions. Their relationship is on an ad hoc basis
                  - to provide additional information when required to do
                  so.


                  Article 148-f(1) of the Constitution of Singapore
                  requires that the Office of the Auditor-General be
                  independent of the government, despite the fact that it
                  is being funded by the government.


                  The Auditor-General is appointed for a term of six years,
                  which is renewable.


              (c) Audit committees in national departments
                  There is no law that requires national government
                  departments and state-owned departments to appoint audit
                  committees. If a state department establishes an audit
                  committee, the chairperson of that committee can be an
                  employee of that department.


                  Cash accounting is practised, but because of legislation,
                  assets registers are kept. The value of an asset is at
                  purchase price and is not devalued until the asset is
                  disposed of.


              (d) Fight against corruption in public sector


                  All the investigations on any corrupt practices uncovered
                  by the Office of the Auditor-General in the cause of
                  auditing state-owned companies and state departments are
                  referred to the Corrupt Practices' Investigation Bureau.
                  The Prime Minister appoints the head of the unit who
                  reports directly to him. The Auditor-General does not
                  perform forensic audits, unless there appears to be
                  irregularities.


                  The prescription period in Singapore is six years. The
                  Office of the Public Service Commission pursues claims
                  for the recovery of money owed to the government. This
                  Office, supplemented by tough punitive measures taken
                  against those found guilty, led to a high success rate in
                  fighting corruption.


         2. Recommendations


              The Committee recommends that:


              (a) It investigate the prescription legislation in Singapore.


              (b) It conduct further dialogue with the public accounts
                  committee of Singapore to clarify certain points.


     C.     Conference in Canberra, Australia - introduction


         The Conference was attended by all members of the Australasian
         Council of Public Accounts Committees (ACPAC), namely public
         accounts committees and Auditors-General of the Federal States of
         Australia, Fidji and New Zealand, and observers from the Canadian
         council of public accounts, the Committee, Executive members of
         the SA Association of Public Accounts Committees (APAC) and
         Auditors-General from Hong Kong and South Africa.


         Presentations were made on the following themes:


         * Accrual Accounting


         * Transparency, including commercial confidentiality


         * Outsourcing risk: Risk management in new contestable environment


         * Retention of corporate memory and skills in public service


         * Public interest in new contestable environment


         * The impact of devolution


         * Measuring performance in the public sector


         Major findings from above-mentioned themes


         1. There is general movement among ACPAC members from cash
              accounting to accrual accounting, and New Zealand seems to be
              at the forefront.


         2. Most countries are outsourcing their service activities.


         3. Loss of corporate memory (skills, experience and knowledge) by
              the public sector is a major problem experienced in the
              process of outsourcing government activities.


         4. Outsourcing by the public sector has created confusion and
              responsibility, accountability was clouded, and some delegates
              were concerned at the long-term liability.


         5. There was general consensus that efficiency and productivity in
              the public sector are no longer the only criteria measuring
              performance, but that outcomes are more important - efficiency
              and productivity are useless unless outcomes are good.


         6. Continuous problems are being experienced by governments trying
              to balance contractual terms with transparency in cases of
              commercial confidence - non-disclosure in the name of
              commercial in-confidence viz-a-viz disclosure for
              transparency.


         7. Measuring performance in the public sector is a very difficult
              task. None of the presenters proposed any satisfactory
              criteria to be used.


         8. There is no clear-cut understanding on what constitutes public
              interest.


     D.     Accrual accounting and its impact on accountability


         The implementation of accrual accounting to replace the cash
         accounting system in many public sectors has seen major
         improvements in accountability in the public sector.


         Presenters argued that accrual accounting is the key to more
         informed decision-making and, therefore, better financial
         management, because it distinguishes between capital and current
         expenditure and facilitates more accurate costing of outputs.


         1. New Zealand experience


              The implementation of accrual accounting in the New Zealand
              central government sector was part of a much wider reform of
              financial management in the public sector. A major reform was
              devolving financial management from central control to the
              control of the departmental chief executive.


              Financial management reforms undertaken by New Zealand
              included the following:


              (a) Changes in the accounting basis, the result of which moved
                  responsibilities and accountability from central control
                  to the operational level.


              (b) Accrual accounting in New Zealand now shows the full costs
                  of programmes and activities, including capital costs and
                  budgets.


              (c) A shift in emphasis from controls over inputs to controls
                  over outputs.


              During the transitional period by departments from cash to
              accrual, the Treasury performed the following key tasks:


              *   Developed a set of accounting policy parameters within
                which departmental accounting policies were constrained, and
                within which general Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
                was used.


              *   Approving the readiness of departments to move on to the
                new system.


              The presenters emphasised that successful implementation of
              the system could be achieved if:


              *   There is wide support so that the changes are effectively
                adopted.


              *   Off-the-shelf commercial software is used.


              *   Changes in human resource management must be implemented
                where directors are given powers to set remunerations and
                hire and fire as they see fit.


     E.     Transparency (including commercial in-confidence)


         Governments throughout the world have many challenges in the
         future, if they are going to achieve a proper balance between the
         legitimate need for secrecy and the transparency necessary to
         ensure an adequate level of government accountability.


         One of the consequences of the managerial approach to modern
         government is that much of the information that reveals the
         activities of government is now of a commercial nature. As a
         result, access to documents by citizens and their elected
         representatives is being prevented by the increased use of
         commercial confidentiality claims.


         The concern at the conference was that this presents a major
         threat to existing mechanisms for ensuring accountability and
         requires a new focus on the issue of commercial confidentiality
         and its effect on the transparency of government activities.


         The Australian Federal State of Victoria, which presented the
         paper on this theme, raised concerns on the impact of
         confidentiality on an open government. It submitted that there was
         widespread concern about the over-use of confidentiality clauses
         in government contracts and an increasing reliance on claims of
         commercial in-confidence to resist disclosure of information. This
         was applied not only to requests for information by members of the
         public, but also to MPs, parliamentary committees and the Auditor-
         General.


         As an attempt to remedy the situation, the federal public accounts
         committee of Victoria has proposed guidelines, which were
         submitted to the Commonwealth Parliaments for adoption. The report
         contained analyses, different in context, in respect of which
         claims for confidentiality may arise. It particularly singles out
         governmental contracts and the tendering process as those
         requiring attention.


         Some of the proposed guidelines are:


         1. Departments must ensure that third parties are made familiar
              with disclosure requirements before providing sensitive
              information to government agencies.


         2. Parliaments must ensure that there is a general assumption of
              disclosure and restrict the use of confidentiality clause in
              government contracts.


         3. The use of confidentiality clauses should be kept to an
              absolute minimum and contracts should instead contain specific
              terms, stating that they are prima facie public documents.


         4. Parliamentary committees and the Auditor-General must have
              unrestricted powers to access commercially sensitive material
              held by government agencies and third parties, in order to
              perform their duties.


         It was, however, pointed out that a variety of options exist for
         dealing with commercially sensitive material and that, where
         genuine reasons exist, it is possible to take middle ground
         between unrestricted access or total confidentiality.


         It was found that the main opponents to disclosure were state
         departments' heads; private institutions were generally quite
         prepared to allow full release of documents.


     F.     Outsourcing risk: risk management in new contestable environment


         Since the 1980s, governments all over the world have been engaged
         in the process of outsourcing of service delivery functions, which
         have traditionally been the sole purview of the government. For
         many governments, outsourcing is considered an attractive
         alternative to standard in-house government service delivery.


         It was observed that competition has forced outsourcing issues to
         become more prominent. It is used to enhance government service
         delivery by introducing competition to the public sector.


         However, as presenters from Queensland, Australia, stated, poorly
         managed outsourcing arrangements can be fraught with risks and may
         result in adverse outcomes for stakeholders.


         Key points which can help mitigate risk in outsourcing
         arrangements


         Departments/agencies should ensure that:


         1. Their core competencies, strategic goals and deficiencies are
              clearly defined.


         2. Arrangements are planned, not hastily entered into. A formal
              contract should exist which specifies the roles and
              responsibilities of the government department and other
              parties entering into the outsourcing arrangement, and should
              include clear provisions to ensure transparency and
              accountability.


         3. Officers managing outsourcing projects have appropriate skills.


         4. There is regular and effective monitoring and evaluation of
              arrangements.


         5. Probity and accountability requirements are observed at all
              times during the outsourcing cycle - outsourcing activity
              should not in any way reduce the risk management obligations
              on an accounting officer.


         6. Outsourcing is only used in those business areas which are
              conducive to outsourcing and will deliver improved returns.


         7. They address sensitive issues associated with potential job
              losses.


         8. They manage the contract. This phase involves managing
              outsourcing arrangements.


         To try and manage such issues, the Queensland government policy on
         contracting out of government services specifies that there will
         be no contracting out of services currently provided in-house,
         other than in circumstances where:


         (a)     Actual shortages exist in skilled in-house staff.


         (b)     There is a lack of available infrastructure capital or
              funds to meet the cost of providing new technology.


         (c)     It can be clearly demonstrated that it is in the public
              interest that services should be contracted out.


         The general view was that service provision, whether through in-
         house provision or outsourcing, ultimately funded through
         appropriations from Parliament and the government, must remain
         primarily responsible and accountable in evaluating the process of
         outsourcing.


     G.     Retention of corporate memory and skills in public services


         Corporate memory is the collective experience, knowledge and
         creative energy stored in employees. It also includes explicit
         knowledge, which is more tangible as it is gained through formal
         processes, databases and manuals. It is formed through the
         collective business experiences, visions, successes and failures
         of all employees.


         There were concerns that:


         1. The loss of experience and expertise in the public sector has
              the potential to adversely affect the ability of the public
              service to conduct its core business efficiently and
              effectively.


         2. Outsourcing public services can place a limitation on
              information sharing - to preserve their jobs, employees
              sometimes guard the specific business information that they
              possess. It is for this reason that public sectors must engage
              in or encourage information sharing within the institution and
              promote succession planning.


         3. Outsourcing is the major contributing factor in loss of
              corporate memory.


         Positive steps towards retention of corporate memory against
         threats from downsizing and contracting out were proposed. It was
         also recognised that the provision of services is not just about
         realising the lowest price, but also about maximising overall
         value for money for the taxpayer - outcomes and ensuring proper
         accountability for the use of public resources.


         Strategies proposed to counter loss of corporate memory in the
         public sector were:


         (a)     Preservation of records - accurate record-keeping and
              maintenance of files.


         (b)     Move towards information technology (IT).


         (c)     Proper use of human resources.


         (d)     Establishing specific policies and procedures to be
              followed, such as having mechanisms in place to deal with
              staff change and hand-over procedures and using standard
              documents.


         (e)     Knowledge management.


     H.     Public interest in new contestable environment


         The purpose of this theme was to define public interest and see
         how best it could be protected.


         Australian Parliaments (Federal and Commonwealth) have effectively
         adopted a practice of defining the term public interest on a case-
         by-case assessment, rather than trying to be prescriptive.
         Therefore, while the term is widely understood and applied, it is
         not precisely defined.


         Parliament, through its membership, is responsible for protecting
         the best interest of the electorate. Presenters argued that the
         executive government is not beyond parliamentary scrutiny and that
         Parliament has a right to have sufficient information available in
         order to fully determine the public interest and benefit of policy
         implementation.


         However, it is acknowledged that there is no clear-cut
         understanding of what constitutes public interest in all
         circumstances. If members of Parliament are to define the public
         interest, it is probably best undertaken on a case-by-case basis
         rather than within a framework of broad controlling principles.


     I.     Impact of devolution


         The debates on this theme were centred on the impact arising from
         the devolution of responsibilities for the delivery of government
         services under the Commonwealth's Financial Management Act in
         respect of Asset Management.


         Effective strategic asset management remains a challenge for many
         government organisations.


         In Australia, the Financial Management and Accountability Act has
         created a framework for better Commonwealth asset management by
         devolving the responsibility and accountability for managing the
         assets of departments and agencies to their Chief Executive
         Officers.


         It is the Commonwealth government's expectation that, through
         accrual budgeting, managers will actively manage their resourse
         base. Managers will also be required to define outputs and link
         them to outcomes.


         Presenters were convinced that better asset management could not
         only realise substantial financial savings for agencies and the
         Commonwealth, but also improve service quality by using assets,
         which are tailored to their purpose and are well managed.


         Assets management could be improved by:


         1. Formulating general guidelines, with the assistance of the
              Auditor-General.


         2. The creation of bodies like asset management forums, which will
              prevent departments from working in isolation. These forums
              should meet regularly to exchange information on assets
              management issues.


         3. Senior management performance measurement should include a
              reference of how assets under their control are managed
              efficiently and effectively.


     J.     Measuring performance in public sector


         The measurement of outcomes, to the extent that it could be
         practically and effectively achieved, could enhance the
         accountability of the executive government.


         The introduction of the Public Corporations Act (PCA) by the South
         Australian Government in measuring performance as it relates to
         government businesses, was the most significant development in
         assisting performance monitoring.


         The requirement for government businesses (subject to PCA) to
         develop a charter and an annual Performance Statement, that
         includes financial and non-financial performance targets, has led
         to performance measurement constituting an essential component in
         running their businesses. This is a highly debated matter. A paper
         was presented and judging from discussions, no solution was
         reached, because measuring performance in the public sector is a
         very difficult task.


     K.     Next ACPAC Conference


         The South African Association of Public Accounts Committees
         (APAC), of which the Committee is a member, was invited to be
         member of ACPAC.
         The representatives of APAC present indicated that the matter
         would be discussed with their members.


         If APAC joins, they will participate in the next ACPAC Conference,
         to be held in Melbourne in 2003.


     L.     Recommendations


         The Committee recommends as follows:


         1. That it be proposed to the Executive Council of APAC that the
              Committee join ACPAC, if finances are available.


         2. That it consider approaching Parliament for resources to carry
              out research work.


         3. That, if it has researchers, it will be in an improved position
              to do investigative work.


     M.     Conclusion


         The delegation, through formal and informal interaction with other
         MPs at the Conference and with the Deputy Auditor-General in
         Singapore, were exposed to some alternative method of dealing with
         issues relating to financial management in the public sector.


         For that reason, the visit was of great benefit to Committee
         members who have to deal with some of these problems in future.


         It was also interesting to note that members of ACPAC are spending
         considerable time on investigative work. The reason for this was
         that they were well-resourced, with an average of three
         researchers and one professional adviser (in most cases an
         academic).


         We thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and the South African
         High Commission in both Singapore and Australia for ensuring that
         our visit was enjoyable.
