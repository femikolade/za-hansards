                          VICTIMS OF TRAIN ACCIDENT

The SPEAKER: Order! I would ask members to remember  also  the  victims  and
families of the KwaZulu-Natal train accident disaster who are now joined  in
a memorial service, even as we meet here.

                             PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

              (Resumption of Debate on Subject for Discussion)

The PRESIDENT  OF  THE  REPUBLIC:  Madam  Speaker,  Deputy  Speaker,  Deputy
President, hon members, when we  addressed  the  National  Assembly  on  the
occasion of the budget debate of the  Presidency  last  year,  we  said  the
following (Hansard 2001, col 5140):


  Since 1994, this Parliament has considered various White Papers and other
  policy initiatives and approved hundreds of laws focused on the  creation
  of the policy guidelines and the legislative framework that  would  guide
  us as a government in carrying through our process of reconstruction  and
  development.  ...  the  Government  is   firmly   of   the   view   that,
  substantially,  we  have   elaborated   the   policy,   legislative   and
  constitutional base that will enable us to achieve the transformation  of
  South Africa ...


  Of course, there are a number of areas that continue to receive attention
  as we seek to finalise our policy and other positions.
We said then that:


  Work on these and other issues will proceed apace.


  Accordingly, the central challenge we face as the Government is the  task
  of implementation. The order of the day is that  we  take  all  necessary
  measures to ensure that the  policy  and  legislative  measures  for  the
  reconstruction and development of our country that have been already been
  adopted  are  further  translated  into  an   actual   process   of   the
  transformation of our society ...


  To summarise the message we seek to communicate to this House and to  the
  country today, it is simply this: Let us get down to the serious business
  of work - working together to create a new South Africa; working together
  to build a country free of racism and sexism;  working  together  to  end
  poverty, unemployment and the  social  marginalisation  of  many  of  our
  people; working together to give an example to the whole world that, as a
  people, we have the capacity to succeed, however difficult the challenges
  we face. The order of the day is to get down to the serious  business  of
  working together for change.

Almost eight months later, when we spoke at the opening of  Parliament  last
Friday, we said the following:


  Of decisive importance to the millions of our people and  the  future  of
  our country, as we meet here today, the central question we will have  to
  answer at the end of the  day  is  whether  what  we  are  doing  as  the
  legislature, the executive, the judiciary, the fourth  estate  and  civil
  society, is helping  to  lift  from  the  shoulders  of  our  people  the
  intolerable burden of poverty and underdevelopment.

We further said, and I quote:


  This  fourth  opening  session  of  our  second  democratic   Parliament,
  including the debate that will take place next  week,  must  answer  this
  question in a frank, honest and forthright manner.

As we conclude the debate on the state of the nation address, I  would  like
to reiterate these two observations. The first is that the order of the  day
is to get down to the serious business of working together for  change.  The
second is that the central question we have to answer  is  whether  what  we
are doing  is  helping  to  lift  from  the  shoulders  of  our  people  the
intolerable burden of poverty and underdevelopment.

What we reported to Parliament and the country on Friday was precisely  that
the Government has got down to the serious business  of  work.  The  further
programme of work for  the  Government  this  year,  as  indicated  in  that
report, will be carried out.

I am also very pleased to see that the masses of our people have  themselves
responded very well to the call to get  down  to  the  serious  business  of
working together for change. During  the  debate,  the  hon  Douglas  Gibson
correctly pointed out the need for all us to  inform  the  people  of  their
rights. These people have, in addition, also  understood  their  duties  and
obligations to themselves, their families and the  nation  and  demonstrated
this in many ways.

 In the period since I addressed Parliament last  week,  there  has  been  a
groundswell from ordinary South Africans, all of them keen to  lend  a  hand
for a better life.

In a newspaper report of 11 February, we read that, and I quote:


  Residents are getting their hands dirty in an attempt to help curb  crime
  in the countryÿ.ÿ.ÿ. More than 500 residents, mostly unemployed,  arrived
  at Moroka police station on Friday armed with  cleaning  equipment.  They
  were joined by plain-clothed police officers in cleaning up the  station.
  And from today Soweto spokesperson Superintendent Richard  Luvhengo  said
  the volunteers would be distributed according to their expertise.
  Some, he said would be taken for roadblocks  and  other  for  patrolling.
  Some will join the police as they patrol the Soweto area,  some  will  do
  administrative work in offices and some will  join  police  who  will  be
  conducting roadblocks and doing searches.

The superintendent said, and I quote:


  ``We feel very proud about the support we are getting from the community.
  It shows that the community have their trust in us  and  they  understand
  that together we can curb  the  level  of  crime  in  this  area,''  said
  Luvhengo.

We must thank the people of this area for their  hard  work.  Such  sterling
efforts  by  the  people  of  Soweto  have  been  complemented  by   similar
initiatives that have sprung up  through  the  length  and  breadth  of  our
country.

In Nkaisane, KwaZulu-Natal, the primary schools have  all  been  cleaned  by
the community. In Ward 1 of the Mshwati municipality, a farmer,  Mr  Warner,
has offered to electrify and install toilets  in  all  six  schools  in  the
municipality free of charge. [Applause.] I  am  told  that  he  has  already
completed one of the schools, and he is left with five.

In Bloemfontein, the Batho and Heidedal police  stations  were  painted  and
cleaned by the people of these  areas,  and  this  Friday  Letsema  goes  to
Welkom where there will also be a march against crime.

In  a  police  station  called  Breyten  in  Mpumalanga,  100  people   have
registered as reservists in the last few days.  In  the  Eastern  Cape,  the
Breidbach community in  King  William's  Town  has  started  cleaning  their
primary school, and in East London, on 9 February alone,  about  400  people
turned up at the Fleet  Street  police  station  to  assist  as  volunteers.
[Applause.]

In the North West province,  in  the  village  of  Gopane,  members  of  the
community have started moving around unblocking toilets in  schools  in  the
area. Yesterday in the North West province 42  young  people  registered  as
reservists at Lomanyaneng police station in Mafikeng.

Professionals have also responded in creative ways to the call. I have  been
told, for instance, that one professional woman auditor  has  donated  funds
to be used for materials needed for the Letsema programme. I have also  been
told about an IT specialist in Midrand who is prepared  to  go  anywhere  in
the country to assist with IT problems in the schools.

Let us unlock the dormant talent and experience in  our  country  and  field
our full team, retired people, working people, the  unemployed,  the  youth,
parliamentarians and everyone, to lend a hand for a better life.  These  are
only a few examples that we as South Africans can be proud of,  that  enable
us to say with full confidence that our people are  prepared  to  strengthen
their partnership with Government, to make a difference  and  to  contribute
in creative ways to improve their lives.

Hon members of this  House  and  their  parties  will  have  to  answer  the
questions from themselves practically as to whether they  are  part  of  the
important process and the popular movement  of  constructive  engagement  in
the reconstruction and development of our country. In this  regard  I  would
like to express my appreciation to those members of the House who  have,  in
fact, already joined in this  campaign  of  Letsema  and  Vuk'uzenzele,  and
encourage them to sustain this involvement as indicated by  the  Chief  Whip
of the Majority Party.

I would also like to thank  other  members  who  have  encouraged  continued
involvement in the volunteer campaign and those such  as  the  hon  Mfundisi
who spoke up about the need for us to encourage a  spirit  of  self-reliance
among our people.

 In the state of the nation address, we sought to focus both Parliament  and
the country as a whole  on  the  critical  issue  of  the  struggle  against
poverty and underdevelopment. This is a matter of central  concern  to  many
millions of our people, characteristic of the ``people of the south''  about
whom the hon Jeremy Cronin spoke.

Last Sunday I was interviewed by the national  broadcaster  on  elements  of
the state of the nation. In a programme lasting three quarters  of  an  hour
not a single question was posed about this fundamental issue of poverty  and
underdevelopment. It is difficult to tell whether this was a mere  oversight
or whether it tells the story of a lack of  concern  for  and  a  dismissive
attitude about a matter which in reality stands at the heart  of  the  birth
of the new society that we are trying to build.

I would like to thank the hon Dowry and other  members  who  addressed  this
matter and assure them that we have noted seriously the concerns  that  they
have expressed. These include the hon members Rev Meshoe,  Louis  Green  and
Pandelani Nefolovhodwe, who raised the important question  of  the  need  to
improve the quality of the houses that we provide  and  the  communities  we
seek to build.

I would also like to thank the hon members Prof Ripinga and Langa  Zita  for
raising the important issue of science and technology and its  relevance  to
the struggle for development and pushing back the frontiers of  poverty  and
underdevelopment. Under the leadership  of  hon  Minister  Ben  Ngubane  and
Deputy  Minister  Brigitte  Mabandla,  the  Government  will   undertake   a
comprehensive review of this important sector to ensure  that  we  correctly
position and resource science and technology, research and  development,  as
a central driver in the process of the modernisation of our country and  the
creation of a better life for all.

Once  more  the  Government  has  recommitted   itself   to   pursuing   the
microeconomic programmes we announced last year, including the  private  and
public sector investment. Among other things, we will continue to  focus  on
the expansion and modernisation of our social and  economic  infrastructure.
I am convinced that the forthcoming growth summit  will  make  an  important
contribution to these economic processes.

As we indicated on Friday, important new interventions will also be made  in
the  areas  of  microfinance  for  productive  purposes,  small  and  medium
business and black economic empowerment. Furthermore, more progress will  be
made with regard to the implementation of  the  integrated  and  sustainable
rural development and urban renewal programmes.

All  of  these  initiatives  address  the  issues  of  economic  growth  and
development and job creation. They are necessarily,  therefore,  focused  on
the central question of pushing back the frontiers of poverty and  expanding
access to a better life. In this  regard,  whatever  the  difficulties,  the
Government will do what it says it will do. We have also said that  we  will
do everything possible to ensure  that  those  entitled  to  receive  social
grants, including the elderly, children and the disabled,  receive  what  is
due to them. We will also focus on the issue of the completion of  the  work
concerned with the consideration of a comprehensive social security  system.
In this connection, the Government will also ensure that the pensioners  who
did not obtain their pensions because of delays in their  registration  also
get what is due to them.  [Applause.]  An  additional  appropriation  of  R2
billion will therefore be made by the end of March 2002 to provide for  back
payments to these elderly citizens.

I would also like to thank the hon Minister Buthelezi and  others  who  drew
attention to the importance of the grants to the  poor  and  urge  that  all
members of the House join in the campaign for  the  speedy  registration  of
those  entitled  to  these  grants.  With  regard  to  the  delayed  pension
payments, I must  make  the  point  strongly  that  it  is  intolerable  and
unacceptable  that  civil  servants  see  fit  to  act  in   a   cruel   and
irresponsible manner ... [Interjections] [Applause] ...  that  sometimes  it
takes up to two years for pensioners to be registered. [Applause.]  This  is
in direct contradiction of the letter and spirit of Batho  Pele  and  cannot
be allowed to continue. Those who do not want to  serve  the  people  should
leave the Public Service. [Applause.]

 The special task team convened to  examine  all  available  information  on
mortality and the burden of disease will complete its work soon.  This  will
assist the Government to conduct a proper review of its health policies  and
ensure that all elements of its work that bear on the health of  our  people
are properly synchronised and co-ordinated. This will also help  greatly  to
focus correctly the process we mentioned  last  Friday  of  our  interaction
with the pharmaceutical industry to implement our  agreement  with  them  to
provide  affordable  drugs  and  medicines  and  to  strengthen  our  health
infrastructure. Once again, with  regard  to  these  and  other  matters  we
mentioned on Friday, the Government will do what it says it will do.

As agreed with the traditional leaders, a White  Paper  on  the  traditional
system of government  will  be  published  this  year,  among  other  things
dealing with the issue of the role and place of traditional leaders  in  our
democratic society. This will enable our country, as a whole, to  contribute
to this important discussion and the finalisation of  all  matters  in  this
sphere. I am pleased to say that we have agreed with the chairperson of  the
National  House  of  Traditional  Leaders,  Nkosi  Mzimela,  that  he   will
undertake a special study on this  matter  elsewhere  on  our  continent  to
assist us in the correct resolution of all outstanding issues.

Various members, including Pieter Mulder and the hon Cassie  Aucamp,  called
for continued attention to the issue of the role and place of Afrikaners  in
our society.  Our  own  starting  point  on  this  matter  is  the  position
explained by the hon  Adv  Dirk  Bakker,  who  said  his  children  are  the
children of the new South Africa, that Afrikaners belong to South Africa  as
much as anybody else and that they are part of the solution,  and  therefore
not part of any problem. It  is  as  South  Africans,  who  share  a  common
nationhood and destiny, that we  have  to  continue  address  the  issue  of
national reconciliation and the building of a nonracial society.

Hon Minister  Buthelezi  called  on  all  of  us  to  be  really  united  in
addressing our common  challenges,  while  recognising  and  respecting  our
diverse  voices.  Others,  like  the  hon  Marthinus  Van  Schalkwyk,  spoke
correctly about the  need  for  us  to  provide  hope  rather  than  promote
hopelessness. This challenge faces all of us. I trust that all  of  us  will
respond positively to this constructive leadership directed  at  building  a
better South Africa.

Urging us to start anew as one people - as she writes, ``to  shiver  in  the
colour of human'' - the poet and writer Antjie Krog has written:


  Hoe word jy heel
  Hoe word jy vrygemaak in begrip
  Hoe maak jy goed
  Hoe sny jy skoon
  Hoe na kan die tong tilt aan teerheid
  Of die wang aan versoening
  'n Punt
  'n lyn wat sê: van hier af
  van die moment af
  gaan dit anders klink
  want al ons woorde lê naas mekaar op die tafel
  bibberend van die kleur van mens
  ons weet nou mekaar
  mekaar se kopvel en reuk, mekaar se bloed
  ons weet die diepste geluide wat mekaar
  se niere maak in die nag
  ons is stadig mekaar
  opnuut
  nuut
  en hier begin dit

Or,  as  the  hon  Sunklavathy   Rajbally   said,   ``Siyaya!''   [forward!]
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The SPEAKER: Order! Before we proceed I wish  to  express  appreciation  for
this Valentine [Laughter.] [Applause.] I am  very  glad  to  note  that  the
benefactor is not a sexist and, at least,  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Home
Affairs shares the affection. [Applause.]

                        ALLOCATION OF SPEAKING TIMES

                             (Draft Resolution)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker,  with  leave,  I  amend
the motion printed on the Order Paper by deleting the  second  paragraph.  I
therefore move as follows:


  That, notwithstanding Rule 106, the  following  times  be  allocated  for
  party responses to today's statement by the Minister of Finance:


     African National Congress: 5  minutes;  Democratic  Party:  4  minutes;
     Inkatha Freedom Party: 4 minutes; New National Party: 3 minutes; United
     Democratic Movement: 2 minutes; all other parties: 1 minute each.

Agreed to.

                   APPOINTMENT OF CURATOR FOR SAAMBOU BANK

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam  Speaker,  Mr  President,  Deputy  President,
members of Parliament, South Africans all, I would like  to  thank  you  for
the opportunity to address Parliament on what is clearly  a  very  sensitive
issue for so many South Africans, namely the crisis affecting depositors  at
Saambou.

 At close of business on Saturday, 9 February, I placed Saambou  Bank  under
curatorship. This was a difficult decision arrived at  after  considering  a
range of options.

I start from the premise that managing a bank is more than merely running  a
business for profit. Banks manage the savings of depositors. They  can  only
perform this function if  very  high  levels  of  trust  exist  between  the
institution and its depositors. For this reason, banks perform a  profoundly
important social function.

This is the basic premise of the Banks Act. Banks are therefore licensed  to
perform this function. The condition of the licence  in  every  instance  is
that the holders are fit and proper and indeed understand that they  perform
a social function. The licence requires the bank to comply  with  a  set  of
criteria, including maintaining capital adequacy and filing regular  returns
with the Registrar of Banks, located at the SA  Reserve  Bank.  This  entire
system is designed to maintain the elements of trust  and  confidence.  When
these elements are eroded, options  have  to  be  evaluated.  This  is  what
happened in respect of Saambou this past weekend.

It  is  important  to  emphasise  that  South  Africa's  banking  system  is
essentially  sound.  We  have  41  registered  banks,  and  the  breach   of
confidence at Saambou is an exception. The health of our banking system  has
been confirmed in an  independent  financial  sector  assessment  undertaken
jointly by the IMF and the World Bank, which  concluded  that  South  Africa
has a sound banking and regulatory environment,  and  that  the  SA  Reserve
Bank's lender-of-last-resort procedures are appropriate and well designed.

Recently, both Standard & Poor's and  Moody's,  the  two  big  international
rating agencies,  reaffirmed  the  soundness  of  South  Africa's  financial
system. Of particular importance here is the fact that all  rating  agencies
have cited South Africa's robust financial system as a key credit strength.

The decision to appoint the curator to Saambou Bank on  Saturday  was  taken
in the public interest, primarily to stem  the  abnormal  outflow  of  funds
from the bank which created liquidity pressures on the  bank,  and  secondly
to stabilise a precarious  situation  which  threatened  the  funds  of  all
depositors.

Our actions were designed to protect the funds of depositors,  in  the  wake
of a marked loss of confidence in the bank and its management. In  examining
options, we firmly held the view that  to  commit  Government  to  financial
assistance to Saambou Bank would not be prudent, as there was  no  guarantee
either that those funds would restore confidence or that those  funds  would
not be utilised to fund further large net outflows  from  depositors'  funds
out of the bank.

Government  views  its  responsibility  as  protecting  the   interests   of
depositors - the widows, the workers and small businesses - and not to  bail
out shareholders, who in any event assume  the  risk  of  their  investment.
Curatorship was considered the mechanism which would best provide a  certain
cost-effective and immediate solution.

Taking this decision was not  without  difficulties,  the  most  glaring  of
which was the freezing of all accounts to enable  the  curator  to  acquaint
himself with all of the detail. The appointment of the  curator  would  also
facilitate the orderly management of the bank's liquidity situation. I  want
to apologise to depositors for this inconvenience, but say at the same  time
that this action is in their best interest.

The curator must now facilitate the orderly  management  of  the  bank.  The
appointment of the curator vests the management of Saambou in  him,  subject
to the supervision of the Registrar of Banks. The curator, Mr John Louw,  is
also required to recover and take possession of the assets of Saambou.

This situation is being handled sympathetically. Already the curator,  in  a
statement dated 12 February 2002, stated, and I quote:


  With regard to deposits made subsequent to the imposition of  curatorship
  on 9 February 2002, including salaries, the curator is in the process  of
  putting in place procedures to allow depositors full access to  all  such
  deposit transactions.

The same will apply to pensions which will be  deposited  into  accounts  at
Saambou banks. Similarly, too, Mr Louw is sympathetic  to  the  position  of
people who live off interest from deposits placed with Saambou.

The Registrar of Banks has advised that his office has no reason to  believe
that Saambou is insolvent. The public should understand that the placing  of
Saambou under curatorship did  not  relieve  persons  who  have  contractual
obligations with the bank from punctually meeting them. Accordingly,  people
with financial commitments in respect of  home  mortgages,  business  loans,
vehicle finance, microloans, etc, must continue to meet these obligations.

The curator is acting as quickly as possible to address the  pressing  needs
of depositors. Of the 520 000 depositors  at  Saambou  Bank,  292  000  have
accounts of R4 000 or less and are able to withdraw their  full  amounts  if
they so wish. Furthermore, the curator is now turning his attention  to  how
to assist hardship circumstances and  will  make  an  announcement  in  this
regard as soon as he is able to.  He  will  ensure  that  announcements  are
regularly made through the media to keep all depositors informed.

The act of curatorship is the placement of this bank in intensive care.  The
institution must be nursed back to strong health.  Most  important  must  be
the interests of the depositors, as I said before - the workers, the  widows
and the small businesses. They are uppermost in  our  mind.  There  are,  of
course, also  those  who  have  been  affected  by  the  freezing  of  their
accounts. They are the people who need our support as  we  commit  ourselves
to nursing this bank back to good health.

In these circumstances I want to appeal to  all  South  Africans  to  remain
calm. The curator, Mr  John  Louw,  is  a  sympathetic,  caring  and  highly
professional curator. [Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, first of all I would like to place  on  record
my thanks to the Chief Whip of the Democratic Alliance, Mr  Douglas  Gibson,
for requesting that time be made available in this  House  to  discuss  this
important matter.

The collapse of Saambou Bank is the biggest ever in South Africa's  history,
with potentially disastrous consequences for its 520 000  depositors  and  2
400 employees. Ordinary people are the victims. We must not let this  matter
rest until we know why the seventh largest bank in South Africa  has  failed
and who is responsible for that.

It is not, however, only a problem about  people  getting  access  to  their
money; there are other issues with  much  wider  ramifications.  Saambou  is
only one of a number of banks which have run into trouble over the past  few
years - at least six in the last two-and-half years alone. The  reasons  for
these problems and failures require urgent investigation.

South Africa rightly prides itself on its sound and sophisticated  financial
institutions and systems. While none of the bank  crises  have  presented  a
systemic risk to our banking system, continual problems of  this  sort  will
erode confidence in our financial institutions at home and abroad.  This  is
the last thing we can afford. We dare not be seen to  have  endemic  banking
crises, even if only smaller  banks  peripheral  to  the  whole  system  are
involved.

Coming on top of the collapse in the value of the rand late  last  year,  we
cannot let there be any  doubt  about  the  soundness  of  our  banking,  if
serious harm is to be avoided.

In June 2000 the Governor of the Reserve Bank appointed a panel  of  experts
under the chairmanship of Judge Dennis Davis, consisting of  six  local  and
foreign experts. The panel  was  required  to  investigate  aspects  of  the
Reserve Bank's lifeboat granted to Bankorp a decade or so ago.

In addition, the panel was asked to recommend  guidelines  for  the  Reserve
Bank in respect of  future  assistance  to  banks  which  were  experiencing
difficulties. The report was completed and handed over in  October  of  last
year. What has happened? Why has it not been released? When is it  going  to
be released? Have the recommended guidelines been followed  in  the  Saambou
case? There are a myriad unanswered questions.

A newspaper report on Tuesday said, and I quote:


  Outraged Saambou account holders gathered outside  the  Waterkant  Street
  Branch in the city centre yesterday in the hope of accessing their money.
  Most stared in disbelief at the ``closed until further notice'' curator's
  note posted on the front door.

They stared in disbelief because their confidence in our banking system  had
been shaken, if not shattered. This was  no  hole-in-the-wall,  fly-by-night
operation, but a well-established, large bank. All the relevant  authorities
and role-players must move  swiftly,  not  only  to  minimise  the  loss  of
confidence in our banking system - I thank the  hon  the  Minister  for  his
statement today - but also to ensure that depositors at Saambou  get  access
to   all   their   money,   including   their   interest,   as    soon    as
possible.[Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Speaker, this has been a very fast-moving story, if  one
thinks it was only last Friday when Fitch  put  out  its  regrading  of  the
seven small banks. There was a degree of panic. I think we saw that  in  the
weekend  newspapers.  There  were  speculations   from   some   quarters   -
unreasonable speculations - of the banking system unravelling. But  I  think
what  we  have  seen  in  the  past  few  days  is  a  number  of  important
interventions by influential players who have stabilised  the  situation.  I
think we had a reaffirmation of our banking sector as being strong,  stable,
and well-regulated. We owe something to those people who intervened.

The reaffirmation relates mostly to the large banks.  I  think  their  share
prices tell a story, including the Nedcor results. The Minister referred  to
the Standard & Poor's reaffirmation that  came  out  earlier  this  week  as
well. Narrowing that down to the smaller banks in question,  some  of  which
were flagged with a new degree of risk by Fitch,  of  course,  and  Saambou,
which I will get to in a moment, I think there again  most  of  those  banks
have argued their cases, and have  also  stabilised  their  situation.  This
brings us down to Saambou. I think it is important that we have put them  in
the context  of  what  this  is  all  about,  and  that  is  what  helps  us
restabilise the situation.

Saambou has been showing a number of bad signs for some time now which  have
been mentioned in the press. We have  seen  the  falling  share  price,  the
inability  of  Investec  to  sell  its  section,  the  rumours   about   the
microlending industry and the rather large book carried by Saambou.  We  saw
Fitch's assessment during  the  previous  month,  where  they  warned  about
issues relating to the profitability, asset quality and capital adequacy  of
Saambou. We have seen that the chief executive  sold  200  000  of  his  own
shares in August last year; and Saambou  itself  issued  a  profit  warning,
etc. So the signs were clearly there. I think the first set of questions  we
must ask if we want to continue reaffirming the solidity  and  stability  of
our banking industry is about why a number of these question were not  taken
a little further. I think there are people we have to look  to  when  posing
those questions.

Firstly, there is the management of  Saambou,  and  a  number  of  corporate
governance angles need to be picked up here. Why did  they  not  react  more
strongly to those signs? I think the Banking Council too should ask why  and
how they responded to those signs, and even the  bank  regulators.  I  think
enough has been said about the credit agencies, particularly Fitch,  who,  I
think we all agree, acted  somewhat  irresponsibly.  Even  though  they  had
reason to reassess the situation,  they  should  have  done  it  in  a  more
responsible way and they should have consulted with Saambou itself.

There are a number of other parties which we see  are  being  spoken  about,
parties possibly involved in insider trading, rogue brokers involved in  the
microlending  market,  suspicious  share  transactions,  which  the  JSE  is
looking into, and, of course, the media. I think  that  during  the  weekend
the media perhaps took it a little further than they should have.

The second set of question relates to what we should have done  about  it  -
what the options were. I think this is what confronted the Minister. He  had
to look at what the Reserve Bank was putting on the table - a  R500  million
loan or package. We do consider this in the light of the Reserve  Bank,  the
central bank, being the  bank  of  last  resort,  which  has  a  kind  of  a
responsibility in this particular development.
But, I think, on balance we do support the Minister and do agree  that  this
is taxpayers' money and one has to think  very  carefully  about  the  risks
that would have been attached to those taxpayers' moneys. But  we  do  think
that his courageous decision, which was not an easy decision,  does  have  a
down-side to it, that it will  not  necessarily  stabilise  Saambou  to  the
point we wanted it stabilised and nurse it  back  to  good  health,  as  the
Minister put it.

Saambou will no doubt come out of this a much  smaller  bank,  with  a  much
weaker balance sheet, which is likely to deteriorate  further.  Its  current
ratio will deteriorate and there  will  be  a  liquidity  squeeze.  I  think
commentators who are authorities on the banking sector are  predicting  this
as well. The share price will continue to fall. The bank is never likely  to
regain its lost market share, so competitive is  the  market.  It  has  been
predicted that the bank will  ultimately  be  sold  off  in  pieces  by  the
curator. Probably the accounts - the 250 000 odd accounts - will go  to  big
banks. The vital  microloan  industry  will  shrink  further.  About  2  400
employees will lose their jobs. The pension policy holders whose  investment
portfolio through Investec, formerly Fedsure, owns 35% ... [Time expired.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, there is far too much moving  up  and  down
and far too many private meetings going on.  The  speakers  have  difficulty
being heard.

Dr P J RABIE:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon  Minister,  hon
members of Parliament, the New NP regard the Saambou  debacle  with  serious
concern, seeing that a number of  other  small  banks  have  failed  in  the
recent past.

The  curator's  report  will  provide  empirical  evidence  of   allegations
regarding  the  responsibility  of  directors  and  whether  they  conducted
themselves in a fit and proper  manner.  The  fact  that  the  Reserve  Bank
provided the curator with liquidity support  will  provide  some  relief  to
thousands of Saambou clients. Any  systemic  threat  to  the  South  African
banking sector must be viewed with serious alarm.  South  Africa,  being  an
emerging market and a commodity-driven economy, requires  sustained  foreign
direct investment for any future growth.

An urgent appeal is made to the banking sector in general to  safeguard  the
interests of shareholders, clients and employees.  Proactive  balance  sheet
management is an integral part of risk control. The question remains  as  to
whether the management of Saambou took  adequate  measures  to  protect  the
interests of their client base.

Consumer protection is essential, especially within  the  financial  sector.
Legislation is  important.  Globalisation  calls  for  universally  accepted
business norms, but an appeal is made to all role-players:  In  the  future,
let us avert the untenable situation that Saambou finds itself in.

My party is of the opinion that the hon the Minister  of  Finance  took  the
proper course of action. [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, hon members of the Cabinet and hon  members,
we offer our sympathy to depositors and employees of Saambou bank, who  have
been caught unawares in this crisis.

The UDM remains a fervent supporter of  a  vibrant  and  properly  regulated
microlending industry. We remain convinced that providing access to  capital
for the many millions of people who were excluded by  past  racial  policies
is critical to the future success of our economy. Both  the  Government  and
the banking industry have crucial responsibilities in this regard. It  is  a
great concern to us that credible microlending institutions  in  the  formal
banking sector are finding themselves in difficulty.

We will support any measure by this Government and  the  Reserve  Bank  that
ensures the integrity of our financial sector.  Lessons  learned  from  this
experience must be implemented to avoid  similar  disasters  in  future.  We
appeal  to  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Finance  to  ensure  that  credible
microlending remains part of the formal banking sector.  In  their  absence,
the despicable practices of unscrupulous loan sharks will  flourish  at  the
expense of poor people who are locked out of the formal banking sector.

 The UDM proposes  that  the  Minister  of  Finance  give  consideration  to
investigating a  deposit  guarantee  system  in  South  Africa.  Either  the
private sector  or  the  SA  Reserve  Bank  could  be  considered  to  carry
responsibility for the premium of  such  a  guarantee.  Such  a  system  may
assist to stabilise the real concerns of individual investors at this  point
in time, and will also promote the investor  confidence  that  the  Minister
has referred to in protecting the interests of investors.

The microlending industry or, more broadly speaking, access  of  capital  to
poor people, was again highlighted with this crisis, and we  appeal  to  the
Minister and to all of us to really address this industry  so  that  we  can
make sure that the investors are protected.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and members,  the  ACDP  supports
and approves Government's actions thus far on the Saambou  crisis,  as  well
as the swift action by  the  authorities  concerned.  We  support  the  view
expressed by the Minister of Finance today concerning the soundness  of  our
country's banking system. We trust that what has happened  to  Saambou  will
not taint the image of our banking system internationally.

We appeal to the curator of Saambou,  Mr  John  Louw,  to  ensure  that  all
depositors, especially those who live off the interests of deposits, do  not
suffer any loss. We appeal to the curator, the Registrar of  Banks  and  the
FSB  to  investigate,  firstly,  the  whole  question  of  possible  insider
trading;  secondly,  the  share  scheme  of  Saambou  in  which  they   were
apparently selling shares on credit to the personnel at a premium;  thirdly,
the  predatory  market  activities  of  debt  mediating  and  administration
orders; and, finally, whether  the  directors  of  Saambou  fulfilled  their
responsibilities. Everything must be done to prevent loss by depositors  and
to underpin the integrity of our banking system.

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, die VF verwelkom die verklaring deur  die
agb Minister van Finansies vandag. Ons dink dit was goed en gepas.  Dit  kon
miskien vroeër gewees het, indien moontlik, omdat dit so  belangrik  is  dat
vertroue in die bankstelsel so vinnig as moontlik herstel word en  dat  daar
geen twyfel daaroor is nie. Ons verwelkom die benadering dat daar  spesifiek
klem geplaas word op die belange van  deposante  by  die  bank,  die  gewone
werker en die mense wat daar belê het. Dit is  die  mense  wat  geraak  word
deur die situasie en wat dit nie kan bekostig om in 'n situasie  te  verkeer
waarin hulle hul tans bevind nie.

Vir 'n land soos Suid-Afrika is dit geweldig belangrik  dat  die  banksektor
gesond sal wees. In 1998 in Rusland ná die ineenstorting  van  die  bankwese
het dit tot gevolg gehad dat daar tot vandag toe nog  nie  werklik  vertroue
in  die  bankstelsel  is  nie.  Dit  het  'n  geweldige  uitwerking  op  die
gemeenskap. Dit is nodig om te sê dat ons in Suid-Afrika  dit  nie  vir  een
oomblik kan bekostig nie en daarom verwelkom  ons  hierdie  benadering.  Die
enigste manier om die vertroue  in  Saambou  te  herstel,  sou,  indien  dit
moontlik sou wees, wees dat geen enkele  belegger  in  die  proses  enigiets
finansieel sal verloor nie. Dit is die enigste  wyse  wat  ons  glo  werklik
mense se vertroue sal herstel in die bankwese. Ons steun  dit.  (Translation
of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, the FF welcomes the statement made  today  by
the hon the Minister of  Finance.  We  thought  it  was  good  and  fitting.
Perhaps it could have come sooner, if possible, because it is  so  important
that confidence be restored in the banking system as soon  as  possible  and
that there be no doubt about this. We welcome  the  approach  that  specific
emphasis is being placed on the interests of the  depositors  at  the  bank,
the ordinary worker and the people who invested there. These are the  people
who are affected by the situation and who cannot afford  to  remain  in  the
situation in which they currently find themselves.

For a country such as South  Africa  it  is  extremely  important  that  the
banking sector is sound. The collapse of banking in Russia in 1998  resulted
in the fact that even today there is still not really any confidence in  the
banking system. This  has  an  enormous  effect  on  the  community.  It  is
necessary to say that in South Africa we cannot afford this for one  moment,
and therefore we welcome this approach. The only way  in  which  to  restore
confidence in Saambou, if indeed it is possible,  would  be  for  no  single
investor to lose anything financially in the process. This is the  only  way
that we believe people  will  have  their  faith  in  banking  restored.  We
support this.]

 Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and colleagues, the volatility in the  South
African banking system in the past six years has seen six  small  banks  hit
the skids. In the case of the debacle surrounding  Saambou,  hope  that  the
bank has sufficient finances to service its clients is  found  in  the  fact
that the SA Reserve Bank did not intervene.

Areas that will need attention, however, are the cutting down of  complaints
by unsatisfied clients,  among  which  are  high  bank  charges,  inadequate
customer service in handling complaints and banking documents not  in  plain
language.

We hope, however, that the Minister of Finance will in future look into  the
integrity of management of small banks and ensure that the central bank  and
his  Ministry  put  in  place  supervisory  measures  that  will  assist  in
detecting shortcommings in banks early enough to avoid a recurrence of  such
a crisis.

The UCDP welcomes the assurance by the Minister that  the  curator  has  the
interests of the clients as his top priority.

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, the PAC  wants  to  commend
the Minister of Finance for placing Saambou under curatorship. We have  seen
many sad faces on television over  the  past  few  days.  The  interests  of
depositors are paramount, not only those of shareholders. People  work  hard
for their money and place their  money  in  the  bank  for  safety  and  not
mismanagement.

It seems from press reports that management inside the  bank  was  aware  of
possible  problems,  but  did  not  act.  The  PAC  hopes  that   a   proper
investigation will be conducted by the curator,  Mr  Louw,  and  that  there
will then be a report to the depositors and to the country as a whole.

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mevrou die Speaker, die FA wil die beleggers van  Saambou
en alle ander banke verseker dat ons alles in ons vermoë sal doen om toe  te
sien dat die Saamboudebakel behoorlik ondersoek word. Ons  wil  weet  watter
rol die graderingsagentskap gespeel het om  'n  gerug  te  versprei  en  hoe
agentskappe en finansiële joernaliste se uitsprake gedissiplineer kan  word.
Ons wil ook die portefeuljekomitee versoek om sy oorsigfunksie na te kom  en
sy eie ondersoek na hierdie saak te loods.

Ons as parlementslede het 'n plig teenoor Suid-Afrikaners  om  te  sorg  dat
hulle geld in veilige hande is wanneer hulle dit in banke belê. Ons het  nie
vertroue in 'n regering wat nie kan toesien dat die rand sterk bly nie.  Ons
het nie vertroue in 'n regering wat nie misdaad kan bekamp nie  en  ook  nie
in 'n regering wat nie medisyne aan vigslyers kan gee nie.

Die FA dring daarop aan dat die portefeuljekomitee die saak ondersoek en  sy
eie verslag oor Saambou en die bankwese ter tafel lê. As  sterker  wetgewing
nodig  is,  moet  die  Parlement  dit  weet  en  voorsien.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, the FA wants to assure  the  investors  of
Saambou and all other banks that we will do everything within our  power  to
see to it that the Saambou debacle is  properly  investigated.  We  want  to
know what role the rating agency  played  in  spreading  a  rumour  and  how
statements by agencies and financial  journalists  can  be  disciplined.  We
also want to  request  the  portfolio  committee  to  fulfil  its  oversight
function and to launch its own investigation into this matter.
We as members of Parliament have a duty towards South Africans to see to  it
that their money is in safe hands when they invest it in banks.  We  do  not
have confidence in a government  which  cannot  see  to  it  that  the  rand
remains strong. We do not have  confidence  in  a  government  which  cannot
combat crime and also not in a government  which  cannot  give  medicine  to
Aids sufferers.

The FA insists that the portfolio  committee  investigates  the  matter  and
tables its own report on  Saambou  and  the  banking  industry.  If  tougher
legislation is required, Parliament must know this and provide it.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the Saambou dilemma has  certainly  been  at
the centre of attention in our newspapers, on TV and radio talk shows,  thus
leaving its clients in a frenzy - and who would not be? The  MF  feels  that
the matter was dealt with a bit irrationally. This may be seen as the  cause
of so much panic. We have,  however,  seen  the  constant  reassurance  that
Saambou is not bankrupt.

The MF feels that placing Saambou under curatorship will be a good  move  in
ensuring that Saambou does not  run  into  bankruptcy  and  that  masses  of
depositors in panic or in fear of the loss of their investments do not  rush
to withdraw them, basically avoiding a run on the bank. Though  this  matter
may be most disillusioning to investors, the  public  may  be  reassured  by
hearing that the IMD in Switzerland has  noted  the  South  African  banking
sector as having being constantly ranked among the top ten in terms  of  its
competitiveness. The MF thanks the Minister of Finance for the quick  action
taken. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, persoonlik is  ek  baie  teleurgesteld  in
die Minister se aankondiging, want ek het 'n verband by Saambou  en  nou  sê
die Minister: ``People with  commitments  will  have  to  continue  to  meet
them''. So ek sal maar moet  betaal.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker,  I  personally  am  very  disappointed  in  the
Minister's announcement, seeing that I have  a  bond  at  Saambou,  and  the
Minister is saying: ``People with commitments will have to continue to  meet
them.'' So I will just have to pay up.]

The Minister of Finance is quoted in the press as  having  said  that  every
time a company was in trouble, it should not be automatically expected  that
the Government should bail it out.

Hierdie aanhaling het my 'n bietjie bekommerd gestem, want 'n  bank  is  nie
maar net 'n maatskappy nie, maar 'n trustee van die publiek. Indien 'n  bank
terminaal siek is, kan ek die optrede verstaan. Dit help nie om  goeie  geld
agter slegte geld  aan  te  gooi  nie.  As  dit  net  'n  geval  is  van  'n
kontantvloeiprobleem, dan is dit sekerlik die plig van  die  Reserwebank  om
ook daar te kan help.

Dit  blyk  egter  nou  dat  daar  'n  baie   sterk   moontlikheid   is   van
bestuurswanpraktykte. Ek kan nie verstaan hoe 'n  mens  aan  personeel  geld
kan leen om aandele te koop nie. 'n Mens koop nie aandele op  skuld  nie  en
dit nou buiten dat die direkteure self hulle s'n verkoop het.

Daarom wil ek vra dat 'n kommissie aangestel word  wat  die  gebeure  rondom
Saambou sal ondersoek en ook die Minister se optrede  duidelik  en  bo  alle
twyfel kan uitklaar. In hierdie stadium glo ons hom,  maar  sodat  daar  vir
altyd gesê kan word dat daar in belang van die publiek opgetree is. Laat  so
'n kommissie nagaan hoe optrede verhoed kan word en hoe die vertroue in  ons
banke herstel kan word. Dit is die AEB se versoek, sodat  ons  hierdie  saak
onafhanklik kan ondersoek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This quote made me feel somewhat concerned, because surely a  bank  is  not
just a company, but also a trustee of the public. If a  bank  is  terminally
ill, I can understand the action. It serves no purpose to throw  good  money
after bad. If it is only a case of a cash-flow problem, then  surely  it  is
the duty of the Reserve Bank to lend assistance there.

It appears, however, that there is a very strong possibility  of  management
malpractice. I cannot understand  how  one  can  lend  staff  money  to  buy
shares. One does not buy shares on credit and this is apart  from  the  fact
that the directors themselves sold theirs.

For that reason I want to  ask  for  the  appointment  of  a  commission  of
inquiry into the events concerning Saambou so as to clearly and  beyond  any
doubt to explain the Minister's actions. At this stage we believe  him,  but
just so that it could always be said action was taken in  the  interests  of
the public. Allow such a commission to determine how action can  be  avoided
and how confidence in our banks can be restored. This is the AEB's  request,
so that we can investigate this matter independently.]

Mr K A MOLOTO: Madam Speaker,  Deputy  President  and  hon  members,  it  is
always important to keep on reminding ourselves,  without  equivocation,  of
the critical roles South African banks  play  in  the  industrialisation  of
this country. Banks are critical intermediaries in  the  smooth  running  of
our economy and mobilise massive  resources  for  allocation  in  productive
activities.

The South African financial system has  a  well-established  reputation  for
its  liquidity  and  a  tradition  of  prudent  management  of  assets   and
liabilities.

It is therefore important  to  avoid  the  generalisation  of  the  problems
encountered by Saambou Bank. Other smaller banks the size  of  Saambou  have
adequate reserves and their assets and liability ratio are  consistent  with
the banking norms and standards already established in the  banking  sector.
It is important to state this fact to dispel any perception of a  contagious
effect arising from the Saambou problems.

However, it is  proper  to  condemn  the  irresponsible  behaviour  of  some
powerful  players  in  the  market  who  exercise  immense   power   without
responsibility. The  downgrading  of  the  investment  grade  of  the  other
smaller banks by Fitch, a rating agency,  reflects  the  exercise  of  power
without responsibility. It is important for rating agencies to exercise  due
diligence in their investigations and final findings to exercise power  with
responsibility.

The whole banking sector depends on trust  between  the  depositor  and  the
banks. One is confident that various boards of directors  of  other  smaller
banks will continuously review the quality  of  the  loans  and  investments
they undertake and stick to the sound asset and liability ratios  which  are
the cornerstone of our banking system.

It is important to reassure all small depositors that in all cases of  banks
in financial distress during the 1980s and 1990s, all small depositors  were
substantially reimbursed. The annual report on banking  supervision  of  the
SA Reserve Bank outlines this point quite clearly. There is  no  reason  for
panic. The protection of depositors' interest remains the objective  in  all
measures taken.

The microlending sector obviously  had  an  influence  on  the  events  that
unfolded  in  the  Saambou  problems.  It  is  therefore  important  that  a
comprehensive  regulatory  framework  be  developed  for  the   microlending
sector.

Let us note that the microlending  sector  plays  a  critical  role  in  the
financing of  people  from  low-income  communities.  Obviously  this  is  a
lucrative market for some smaller banks  that  have  virtually  no  base  of
corporate clients and wish to enhance their returns.

It is important to develop a holistic approach  to  the  regulation  of  the
microlending sector with a particular emphasis on the prudential  management
of its liabilities. However, we should not allow some  of  these  operations
to destabilise the South African banking sector.

It is, however, proper to indicate and congratulate the speedy  response  of
the regulators in this country to avert what  could  have  been  a  systemic
risk. [Applause.]
The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, after  some  consultation,  as  this  is  a
special case, I am allowing the Minister of Finance to read  the  few  lines
he forgot from his statement. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, thank you, I will  read  that  as  a
Valentine's Day gesture as well, and we thank the DP for conceding to this.

Ek wil namens die Regering  al  die  partye  bedank  vir  hulle  bydrae  tot
hierdie bespreking vanmiddag. Ons moet verhoed  dat  hierdie  aangeleentheid
tweespalt onder politieke partye bring. Dit is  nie  die  ANC  wat  aan  die
bestuur van Saambou is nie. Die deposante in Saambou kom uit alle oorde.  In
hierdie omstandighede moet ons almal hande  vat  en  saam  besluit  hoe  ons
vorentoe gaan. [Applous.]

Die belangrikste ding wat ons nou moet doen, is om  aan  die  deposante  van
Saambou te sê dat hul geldjies ons belang is. Ons sal  seker  maak  dat  dit
nie met die rivier af gaan nie. Ons sal alles in ons vermoë  doen  om  seker
te maak dat die  werkers,  die  weduwees  en  die  wewenaars  se  gelde  ...
[Tussenwerpsels.] Daar is maar min  van  hulle.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[On behalf of the Government I want to  thank  all  the  parties  for  their
contribution to this discussion this afternoon. We must prevent  this  issue
from causing dissension between political parties. It is not  the  ANC  that
is managing Saambou. Depositors of Saambou  come  from  all  spheres.  Under
these circumstances we should all join hands and decide  together  what  the
way forward is. [Applause.]

The most important thing we have to do now is  to  tell  the  depositors  of
Saambou that their money is our concern. We shall ensure that  it  does  not
go down the river. We shall do everything possible to ensure that the  money
of the workers, the widows  and  widowers  ...  [Interjections.]  There  are
really only a few of them.]

 But we must provide the certainty to those people that they  are  uppermost
in our minds. I think it is also important that  once  we  have  done  that,
once we have secured the interest of depositors, we should begin to look  at
the other issues that the hon Dr Woods referred to.

If there have been wrongdoings, let us bring those individuals to book.  Let
us prosecute them,  let  us  show  them  that  they  cannot  get  away  with
impunity, let us take joint responsibility for the fact that  banking  is  a
social service and let us ensure that depositors can  maintain  their  trust
in the banking industry  in  this  country,  because  that  will  always  be
preferable to hiding their money under the mattress.

That is our joint responsibility and I am so glad that so many  members  who
spoke on this issue see it in that way. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                     (The late Mr Stefanus Petrus Grové)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  motion
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness the passing away of Mr Stefan Grové, who served as
       a member of the Senate and the National Council of Provinces  between
       1994 and 1999 and as a Member of this House since 1999;


  (2) recognises the outstanding contribution  made  by  Mr  Grové  to  the
       transformation of our country into a democratic state, never allowing
       his physical constraints to impinge upon his dedication to duty;


  (3) honours his life of service and dedication and mourns the passing  on
       of one our land's finest sons; and


  (4) extends its condolences to his wife, Julie, and  his  children,  Disa
       and Jenz.
Mr G P MNGOMEZULU:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Deputy  President,  Ministers  and
members of Parliament, today we mourn the passing on of a true  patriot  and
comrade, a South African who refused to  remain  idle  when  his  conscience
dictated that he reject and oppose oppression and exploitation.

Comrade Stefanus Grové is one of those patriots who was able  to  cross  the
Rubicon and join the masses of our people in working for a better  life  for
all. This he did by joining the ANC and by being involved  in  a  number  of
organisations which were aimed at voicing the concerns of our people.

Comrade Grové was born in Krugersdorp on 15 November 1948. He  received  his
primary education in Paardekraal Laerskool in Krugersdorp.  He  matriculated
in  1966  and  enrolled  for  tertiary  education  at  the   University   of
Potchefstroom. It is at this institution  that  Comrade  Stefanus  began  to
pave a future for himself, a path  that  began  to  define  Stefanus  as  an
activist with a profound interest in the material wellbeing of our people.

During his life at university he was a member of the  debating  society  and
political philosophy society. He rose within the ranks of  student  activism
and was elected a member of the student  representative  council.  Like  all
other white youth during apartheid rule, Stefanus's life was interrupted  as
he was forced to undergo military training by the then apartheid regime.

After completing his B Juris degree he worked as an  attorney  in  Nelspruit
and later in Potchefstroom. His academic  achievements  and  the  privileges
accrued by the minority group under apartheid rule did not  deter  him  from
his quest for a country which  respected  and  protected  human  rights  and
dignity for all citizens.

The first break that Comrade Stefanus made with the apartheid  establishment
was when he joined the ANC. Comrade Stefanus made his quantum  leap  because
he realised that the ANC  was  a  vehicle  for  fundamental  change  in  our
country. He made this  move  because  he  was  generally  committed  to  the
fundamental transformation of society. He  realised  that  people  from  all
walks of life had to unite to build a  country  which  protected  the  human
rights and the dignity of all its people.

At the time when Comrade Stefanus Grové passed away he was a member of  this
august House. He will therefore be missed by many of us in the ANC  and  all
members who worked with him in  the  environment  portfolio  committee,  for
which he did a lot of work, even during his sick leave. He  will  be  missed
by his family and his loved ones. Comrade Stefanus leaves  behind  his  wife
and two children, Disa and Jenz. May his soul rest in peace.

[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker,  the  Official  Opposition  is  glad  to  be
associated with this motion of condolence. Stefan  Grové  was  a  well-known
member of the Senate,  of  the  NCOP,  and  then  of  this  House.  Everyone
recognised him because of his disability. He was not one  of  the  anonymous
mass, and it was remarkable how many warmed to him as a human being.

Stefan was a person who lived with an enormous burden  that  he  managed  to
overcome with a cheerful smile and a refusal to accept that there  were  too
many limitations on what he could do. We met every Sunday afternoon  at  the
airport in Johannesburg on the trek back to Cape Town for a number of  years
and we always had a laugh and a chat.

Just as he was burdened with great misfortune, he was also  greatly  blessed
in his marriage. Julie was a loyal, loving and uncomplaining wife  who  many
came to admire and to like, as I did. We, on this side of  the  House,  join
in honouring the life of  our  late  colleague,  and  we  express  our  very
sincere condolences to his party, to his many friends and to  his  wife  and
family. We will remember him. [Applause.]

Mnr J H SLABBERT: Mevrou die Speaker, die IVP  wil  aansluit  by  wat  reeds
gesê is deur die vorige sprekers.
Ek dink Stefan Grové was 'n simbool van dapperheid en  toewyding  vir  almal
van ons. Sy merkwaardige intellek en vermoë om sy  saak  met  oortuiging  te
stel, sal ons in die IVP altyd bybly. Sy  blymoedigheid  ten  spyte  van  'n
ongeluk, wat hom aan sy rystoel geknel het,  sal  onthou  word,  só  ook  sy
liefde vir die bewaring van die  natuur  en  die  omgewing.  Sy  insette  in
wetgewing omtrent omgewingsake en  toerisme  sal  deur  die  hele  Parlement
gemis word.

Ons bring hulde aan Stefan Grové, en ons innige meegevoel  gaan  uit  na  sy
gesin en sy moeder. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, the IFP  would  like  to  associate  itself
with what has already been said by the previous speakers.

I think that Stefan Grové was a symbol of courage and dedication for all  of
us. We in the IFP will always remember  his  remarkable  intellect  and  his
ability to state his case  with  conviction.  His  cheerfulness  despite  an
accident which restrained him to his wheelchair will be remembered, as  well
as his love for the conservation of nature and the  environment.  His  input
regarding legislation on environmental matters and tourism  will  be  missed
by Parliament as a whole.

We pay homage to Stefan Grové and our  deepest  sympathy  goes  out  to  his
family and his mother.]

Stefan,  we  greet  you.  Stefan,  hamba  kahle.  [Stefan,  rest  in  peace.
[Applause.]]

Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, on  behalf  of  the  New  NP,  I  want  to
support the motion of condolence by the Chief Whip of  the  Majority  Party,
as it appears on the Order Paper.

We know that the deceased had a very serious operation during the year  2001
and, after a long illness, died during January 2002.

Ons  eer  sy  nagedagtenis  en  vertrou  dat  sy  familie  vertroosting   en
aanvaarding sal vind in al die mooi herinneringe  aan  hom.  [Applous.]  [We
honour his memory and trust that his family will find solace and  acceptance
in all the beautiful memories of him. [Applause.]]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, we wish to associate ourselves  with  the  motion
before us. It is with deep regret and a sense of shock  that  we  learnt  of
the passing of our esteemed colleague. Our colleague who, in  spite  of  his
physical  disability   and   paraplegic   condition,   made   a   noteworthy
contribution not only to this House, but to all the organisations  in  which
he served. He was a community person who  took  part  in  various  community
activities.  He  was  president  of  Globe  Southern  Africa,  and  he   was
passionate about environmental issues.

His  passionate  plea  in  this  House  for  improved  facilities  that  are
disability-friendly will not  easily  be  forgotten.  I  note  that  various
changes are taking place around this place in order  to  accommodate  people
in similar condition.

Aan mev Grové en haar gesin wil ons sê: Mag  God,  ons  Almagtige  Vader,  u
onderskraag in hierdie moeilike tyd van beproewing.

Laat ons almal onthou dat dit is aan Hom wat ons behoort, en dit is  na  Hom
waarheen ons sal moet terugkeer. Mag u troos vind in  die  wete  dat  u  aan
Suid-Afrika en aan al sy mense 'n persoon  by  die  naam  van  Stefan  Grové
beskikbaar gestel het. Ons weet dat u as gesin moeilike tye deurgegaan  het,
terwyl hy in die diens van sy land en al sy mense gestaan het. Mag  sy  siel
in vrede rus. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[To Mrs Grové and her family we want to say: May God, our  Almighty  Father,
keep you in these times of trial and tribulation.

Let us all remember that we belong to Him and that it  is  to  Him  that  we
must return. May you find solace in the knowledge  that  you  availed  South
Africa and all its people of a person by the name of Stefan Grové.  We  know
that you, as a family, went through a  trying  time  while  he  was  in  the
service of his country and all its people.  May  his  soul  rest  in  peace.
[Applause.]]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the ACDP, I wish  to  express  our
sincere condolences to the family, loved ones, friends and colleagues of  Mr
Stefan Grové. It is always a sad  occasion  for  us  when  the  death  of  a
colleague is announced. This is so because it reminds us of the  uncertainty
of life itself. It should cause us to reflect  upon  our  relationship  with
our Creator and with Jesus Christ. Stefan was a follower  of  Jesus  Christ,
and we can have succour in that knowledge.

I came to know Stefan in the Portfolio Committee  on  Environmental  Affairs
and Tourism, where he and I served as the unofficial legal advisers  on  the
committee. He was at all times highly professional,  courteous  and  a  true
gentleman who will be sorely missed by all.

May our heavenly Father comfort all those who grieve at  this  time  and  in
particular his wife, Julie, and his children, Disa and Jenz. [Applause.]
Dr  C  P  MULDER:  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  VF  wil  baie  graag  hulself
vereenselwig met die mosie wat vandag op die Ordelys  verskyn  en  voor  die
Huis dien, waarin ons ons erkenning verleen aan en  dank  uitspreek  teenoor
die lewe van 'n kollega van ons wat met ons in hierdie Huis  gedien  het  en
wat sedert 1994 'n lid van die Parlement was.

Ek het Stefan Grové baie goed geken en het hom ook goed leer ken vóórdat  hy
na die Parlement gekom het. Ons het aan dieselfde universiteit studeer,  aan
dieselfde fakulteit waar hy hom ook  in  die  regte  bekwaam  het.  Ons  wil
graag, van ons kant, ons innige  simpatie  uitspreek  teenoor  sy  politieke
party wat 'n kollega verloor het, en herhaal dat ons Stefan  goed  leer  ken
het.

Ons wil ons dank uitspreek vir die lewe wat hy gehad  het,  en  ons  wil  sy
vrou, sy familie en sy vriende sterkte toewens in die moeilike tyd wat  daar
nog vir hulle voorlê. Ons eer sy gedagtenis. Hulle kan  met  trots  aan  hom
terugdink. Hy was 'n waardevolle eggenoot en vader vir sy gesin.

Ons steun graag die  mosie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, the FF would  very  much  like  to  associate
themselves with the motion on today's Order Paper which is  now  before  the
House, in which we acknowledge and express  gratitude  for  the  life  of  a
colleague of ours who served with us in this House and who was a  member  of
Parliament since 1994.

I knew Stefan Grové very well and also got to know him well before  he  came
to Parliament. We studied at the same university, as well  as  at  the  same
faculty at which he also qualified in the field of law. From  our  side,  we
wish to express our deepest sympathy with  his  political  party,  who  have
lost a colleague, and repeat that we got to know Stefan well.

We want to express our gratitude for the life that he led, and  we  want  to
wish his wife, his family and his friends well in the difficult  times  that
still lie ahead for them. We honour his memory. They can remember  him  with
pride. He was a treasured husband and father to his family.

We take pleasure in supporting the motion. [Applause.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, it is a sad day on which  we
pay tribute to Stefan. I served with  him  on  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Environmental Affairs and Tourism. He  was  passionate  about  environmental
issues and struck me with the depth he displayed on such issues. He was  the
unchallenged president of Globe, the Global Legislators' Organisation for  a
Balanced Environment, in the Southern African region.

Despite being confined to a wheelchair, something  most  of  us  would  have
considered a constraint, Stefan showed great agility. He never hesitated  to
go out on committee work. I remember, when  we  visited  the  Addo  Elephant
Park in Port Elizabeth, he shared  wonderful  experiences  on  environmental
issues with us and cracked jokes about practical experiences he had had.
One  could  remain  spellbound  whilst  listening  to  him  telling  of  his
experiences and adventures in the freezing Antarctic. Although  Stefan  wore
a pleasant smile, it belied the agony he was going through. He would  relate
the pains he felt in almost his entire body, yet he carried  all  that  with
admirable stoicism.

Stefan was a legal eagle who carried himself  with  admirable  humility  and
dignity. Our condolences go out to his wife, who was  always  by  his  side,
his family, the ANC and to this Parliament. We were  blessed  to  have  been
able to rub shoulders with him. May he have perpetual peace in the sight  of
his Creator. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the PAC supports the motion of  condolence  on
the unexpected death of our colleague, Stefanus  Petrus  Grové.  We  believe
that people like him, who have risen from where they started,  right  up  to
this House, and who in a very special way represented not  only  the  people
of South Africa, but actually made us more aware  of  and  taught  us  about
disability and how to react to it, are great. I want to say  that  the  life
of a human being is not measured in years; it is not the length of  it  that
matters, but its quality.

I believe that Stefanus's life was  a  life  of  quality  that  demonstrated
worth and quality to us all and to the people  of  South  Africa.  We  would
like to express our very sincere condolences to his family. I  want  to  say
that their loss is our loss. May God bless him and  may  his  soul  rest  in
peace. [Applause.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mevrou die Speaker, ons  dank  teenoor  die  kollega  wat
hierdie voorstel ingedien het.  Graag  wil  ek  namens  die  FA  ons  innige
meegevoel uitspreek teenoor die vriende en familie van mnr Grové,  asook  sy
kollegas in die Parlement en sy party.

Ek en dr Van Niekerk  het  weinig  kennis  van  hom  as  mens,  maar  by  'n
geleentheid soos hierdie, omhels ons sy familie en sy vriende. Ons  verstaan
hul hartseer en ons bede sal sy naasbestaandes  insluit.  Ons  bid  dat  hul
troos sal vind in sy nagedagtenis en dat sy naasbestaandes  in  die  dae  en
jare wat voorlê, inspirasie sal put uit sy lewe wat so kort was  in  hierdie
Parlement  en  dat  almal  net  goeie  herinneringe  aan  hom  sal   oorhou.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ; Madam Speaker, we want to convey  our  gratitude  to  the
colleague who tabled this  motion.  I  would  like  to  extend  our  deepest
sympathies to the friends and family of Mr Grové as well as  his  colleagues
in Parliament and his party.

Dr Van Niekerk and I have little knowledge of him as a  person,  but  on  an
occasion such as this, we embrace his  family  and  friends.  We  understand
their grief and our prayers will include his next of kin. We pray that  they
will find solace in his memory and that his relatives will, in the days  and
years that lie ahead, draw inspiration from his life  in  Parliament,  which
was so brief, and that  everyone  will  only  have  fond  memories  of  him.
[Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF expresses its sincere condolences  to
the bereaved family and loved ones of the late Stefanus  Petrus  Grové,  who
leaves behind his wife, Julie, and his children, Disa and Jenz. Knowing  the
loss of a loved one is by no means easy. We pray  that  God  may  bless  his
family with the strength to overcome this difficult time and love and  guide
them through the years to come. It is always sad to hear of the  loss  of  a
fellow member.

Even though I did not have the opportunity to know the deceased  personally,
I certainly  learnt  of  his  reputation  as  a  great  contributor  to  the
transformation of our country into a democratic  state,  and  how  dedicated
his service was to the Senate and the National Council of Provinces  between
the years 1994 and 1999, 1999 being the year  from  which  he  served  as  a
member of this House. He is said to have been well skilled in the  knowledge
of our law and, though paraplegic, by no  means  limited  in  delivering  an
outstanding contribution.

He  has  certainly  served  as  a  shining  example  of  dedication  to  the
liberation of our country. This, his struggle for  sustainable  development,
will live on as an inspiration to us who remain  in  order  to  continue  to
work hard in this fight.

Once again the MF extends its condolences to his party, the ANC, and to  the
bereaved family and friends of the late Stefanus Petrus Grové. May  he  rest
in peace. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek het Stefan Grové bykans 30 jaar  gelede
in my studentedae op Potchefstroom leer ken toe hy as 'n jong,  voortvarende
prokureur 'n transport vir my gedoen het. Ons kom uit  dieselfde  kraal:  'n
tradisionele  Afrikanerhuis,  1  Spesiale   Pantserbataljon,   Potchefstroom
Universiteit, Gereformeerde Kerk. Ons paaie het uiteengeloop: hy in die  ANC
en ek in die AEB, hy in die Corpus Christi-gemeente  en  ek  nog  'n  stoere
Dopper.

Tog, toe ons in 1999 weer hier in die Parlement  ontmoet,  het  ons  dadelik
aanklank by mekaar gevind. Ons het  heelwat  gesprekke  met  mekaar  gedeel,
veral hier buite in die vierkant as hy sy Camel opsteek en ek my  pyp.  Daar
was verskil, maar altyd opbouende gesprekvoering en dit omdat ons  mettertyd
wedersyds onder die indruk gekom het van elkeen se opregtheid en dit  waarin
hy glo en mekaar se bona fides aanvaar het. Stefan het op grond van  hierdie
oortuigings  van  hom  opgetree  en  vir  sy  tyd  'n  ongewilde   stap   in
Afrikanergeledere gemaak en dít omdat hy volgens sy gewete gehandel het.

Ek onthou hom veral vir sy bydrae in die komitee  oor  die  wetsontwerp  oor
gelykheid. Stefan se sin vir geregtigheid en sy aanvoeling vir die  reg  het
daartoe  bygedra  dat  die  eindproduk  veel  beter  was.  (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I met Stefan Grové about 30  years  ago  during
my time as a student at  Potchefstroom,  when  he,  as  a  young,  energetic
attorney did  a  title-deed  for  me.  We  come  from  the  same  stable:  A
traditional Afrikaner home,  1  Special  Armoured  Battalion,  Potchefstroom
University, Reformed Church. Our ways parted: He in the ANC  and  I  in  the
AEB, he in the Corpus Christi congregation and I  still  a  stalwart  Dopper
[member of the Reformed Church].

Nevertheless, when we met again here in Parliament in 1999,  we  immediately
found  that  the  appeal  was  still  there.  We  had  many   conversations,
especially out here in the quadrangle, when he lit a Camel and  I  my  pipe.
There was differing, but we always had constructive  discussions,  and  that
was so because in time we realised how sincere the other was and because  we
accepted what the other believed in and one  another's  bona  fides.  Stefan
acted on the grounds of these convictions of his, and for his time  he  took
an unpopular step among the ranks of Afrikaners, and he had done so  because
he had acted according to his conscience.

I remember him specifically for his contribution in  the  committee  dealing
with the Equality Bill. Stefan's sense of justice and his  feeling  for  the
law contributed to the end product being so much better.]

The fact that the Bill placed special  emphasis  on  discrimination  on  the
grounds of disability, next to race and gender, can, to a great  extent,  be
related to Stefan's presence in that committee. With the death of Stefan,  I
lost one of my friends in Parliament.

To his wife, Julie, who  supported  him  unselfishly,  and  in  the  process
became an expert at driving a wheelchair, to his two children,  and  to  his
family, my personal condolences and those of the AEB.

May God comfort and give Julie the strength to travel the path  ahead  in  a
way Stefan would be proud of, according to the example he set  for  us  all.
[Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President,  Azapo  wishes  to
convey its deep-felt condolences to  the  wife  and  children  of  the  late
Stefan Grové. Likewise, at this moment of sadness, Azapo joins the  ANC  and
all who knew him and his sterling contributions towards  the  betterment  of
our people.
One wise man once said: ``Once born means to die''. By that  he  meant  that
one must live one's life so as to make a  contribution  to  those  who  will
follow. May God bless his soul. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! The Deputy Speaker and I  wish  to  associate  ourselves
with the sentiments that have been expressed in this  House.  Would  members
please rise and observe a moment of silence in memory of our late  colleague
Stefan Grové.

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to, all members standing.
