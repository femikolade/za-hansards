                                    ____

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

                                 NEW MEMBER

                               (Announcement)

The Speaker announced that the vacancy caused by the resignation of Dr  A  S
Nkomo had been filled, in accordance with item 6(3) of  Schedule  6  to  the
Constitution, 1996, by the nomination of Ms H N Qegu with effect from 1  May
2002.
Ms H N Qegu, accompanied by Mrs M C Lobe and Mr  S  D  Montsitsi,  made  and
subscribed the oath and took her seat.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, it  is  most  appropriate  that  we  should
today swear in a new member to this National Assembly. She  is  particularly
welcome today, because today we mark the occasion when 90 years ago  African
and coloured women  from  the  Free  State  came  and  first  addressed  the
institution of Parliament in order to seek  redress  from  the  restrictions
that were imposed on them. [Applause.]

We have with us some of the women whom we  are  celebrating,  including  the
premier of the Free State, a woman who very wisely  was  appointed  in  that
position.

An HON MEMBER: Halala! [Well done!] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Thank you all.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION
Mrs N B GXOWA: Madam Speaker, I give notice  that  at  the  next  sitting  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the extraordinary role played by women in the struggle for  the
       liberation of the people of South Africa and  the  struggle  for  the
       rights of women and gender equality, a role that  goes  back  to  the
       roots of our liberation movement and the foundation  of  the  African
       National Congress;


  (2) recalls that 90 years ago women from the Free  State  collected  more
       than 5 000 signatures and handed over a petition, protesting the laws
       and regulations that entrenched the inferiority of women; and


  (3) pays honour to these mothers of our liberation, whose contribution to
       the values  that  underpin  the  policies  of  the  African  National
       Congress are a foundation stone of  the  free  and  democratic  South
       Africa.
[Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the opinion expressed by hon Minister Lekota last week in which
       he conceded that the ANC's  policy  of  ``quiet  diplomacy''  towards
       Zimbabwe has failed;


  (2) congratulates  the  hon  Minister  for  being  the  first  member  of
       Government to have the courage to state publicly  what  has  been  so
       obvious to all for so long;


  (3) observes that Zanu-PF misrule has led to untold misery  for  millions
       of Zimbabweans and constitutes a threat to our entire subcontinent;


  (4) therefore censures the hon the President, the  hon  the  Minister  of
       Foreign Affairs and all members of the ANC, including especially  the
       members of the Parliamentary observer mission who lacked the  courage
       to take a principled stand against tyranny and misrule; and


  (5) urges the hon the President to follow the  example  set  by  Minister
       Lekota and to put the interests of the people of Zimbabwe and of  the
       subcontinent before his loyalty to the Mugabe regime.
[Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) is aggrieved by the fact that members of the SAPS are under siege  by
       the criminal elements who do not want to see crime levels going down;


  (2) sadly notes that 185 police officers were murdered in the year  2000,
       and that 163 police officers were murdered in 2001;


  (3) further notes that police officers have become targets because, among
       other things, criminals want to loot their firearms;


  (4) wishes all bereaved families emotional recovery  for  the  loss  they
       have endured of their loved ones; and


  (5) appeals to the public at large to identify the  criminals  to  ensure
       the safety of the communities that the police is trying to maintain.

Mrs B M NTULI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Thabo  Mbeki  visited  Norway  to  persuade  the
       Nordic countries to support Nepad;


  (2) further notes that the Nordic countries played an important  role  in
       supporting the struggle for the liberation of  the  people  of  South
       Africa;


  (3) welcomes the initiatives by the President of the  Republic  of  South
       Africa, the hon Thabo Mbeki, to influence the international community
       to support the Nepad initiative; and


  (4) calls on the Nordic countries  and  the  international  community  to
       support Nepad, as it is a viable plan to address underdevelopment and
       poverty caused by the legacy of colonialism, apartheid and racism  on
       the African continent.
[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move at the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the announcement to the effect that 33  prisoners,  among  them
       members of the ANC and the PAC who failed to  get  amnesty  from  the
       Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission,  have  received  presidential
       pardons;


  (2) has no objection in principle to presidential pardons, but is of  the
       opinion that these should be granted in an  equitable  and  impartial
       manner by the head of state;


  (3) regrets the lack of specific information around the  releases  as  to
       who those pardoned are and for what crimes; and


  (4) therefore calls on -


       (a)  the Government to be completely transparent about such releases;
           and
       (b)  the President to be completely evenhanded in any  pardons  which
           may be contemplated for those to whom amnesty was denied by  the
           Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I will  move  on  behalf  of
the UDM at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  the  contradictory  statements  by  the  Eastern  Cape  Health
       Department permanent secretary and the Eastern Cape Health MEC, which
       creates confusion regarding whether or not the province's eight cash-
       strapped SA National Tuberculosis,  Santa,  hospitals  have  received
       their subsidies;


  (2) further notes the importance of  these  hospitals,  especially  in  a
       province that has experienced a TB crisis since the 1950s,  and  duly
       notes that these hospitals run at one-eighth of the cost to the state
       when compared to provincial hospitals;


  (3) expresses concern at the bureaucratic bungling  by  state  officials,
       especially in the light that TB is the province's biggest killer; and


  (4) calls on the Minister of Health to  intervene  urgently  and  address
       this issue adequately.

Miss M N BUTHELEZI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that former President of the United States,  Mr  Jimmy  Carter,
       visited Cuba;


  (2) further notes that during this visit he met with the President of the
       People's Democratic Republic of Cuba, Comrade Fidel Castro;


  (3) believes that -


       (a)  this historic visit has the potential of ushering in a  new  era
           in the United States-Cuba relations; and


       (b)   decades  of  economic  blockade  aimed   at   undermining   the
           sovereignty of Cuba and the right of  its  people  to  determine
           their own destiny may come to an end in the long term;


  (4) welcomes the historic visit by Jimmy Carter; and


  (5) hopes that it will  contribute  positively  to  the  lifting  of  the
       economic blockade against the freedom-loving people of Cuba.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  our traditional leaders cannot be wished away as  they  are  our
           entry point to the African system of governance;


       (b)  the Government needs to decide whether our  traditional  leaders
           will be kept as rulers in the ghettoes of former  bantustans  or
           brought to the centre of the African system of governance;


       (c)  the recent removal through an  SABC  media  announcement  on  27
           March this year of Paramount Chief Samuel Mankuroane, the  Kgosi
           of Batlhaping ba ga Phuduhucwana, by the North  West  Provincial
           Executive Council violates the norms of  our  legislation  which
           require the community and members of the tribe to be consulted;


       (d)  there is a dispute in the chieftaincy  and  the  Premier  should
           utilise the full provisions of the law  to  settle  the  dispute
           within the community of Taung; and


       (e)  the PAC demands  that  reported  acts  of  intimidation  by  the
           paramount chief be fully investigated;


  (2) notes with deep concern the unwillingness of the Premier of the North
       West to meet with the Kgosi of Batlhaping ba ga Phuduhucwana and  the
       community  of  Taung,  despite  several  written  requests  from  the
       community ...
[Time expired.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, namens die AEB gee ek kennis dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat president Mbeki aan  33  gevangenes,  waarvan
       sommige deur die WVK amnestie geweier is, presidensiële  kwytskelding
       verleen het ingevolge sy reg kragtens artikel 84(j) van die Grondwet;


  (2) die President versoek om dringend die name en oortredings van en  die
       motivering vir sy besluit te verskaf, asook die kriteria  waarvolgens
       hy hierdie kwytskelding verleen het;


  (3) in die lig van die feit dat hierdie kwytskelding slegs  aan  ANC-  en
       PAC-veroordeeldes verleen is, ander politieke partye dringend versoek
       om 'n gemotiveerde aansoek by die Presidensie  in  te  dien,  en  die
       President versoek om sodanig op te tree dat verseker word dat hierdie
       saak nie 'n selektiewe politieke kleur kry waarin die politieke  kant
       waar die oortreder gestaan het die deurslaggewende faktor  word  nie;
       en


  (4) sy vertroue uitspreek dat hierdie besluit van die President die begin
       sal wees van die finale toemaak van die boeke van die verlede.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that, in accordance with his powers in terms of  section  84(j)
       of the Constitution, President Mbeki has granted presidential  pardon
       to 33 prisoners, some of whom were refused amnesty by the TRC;


  (2) requests the President urgently to furnish the names and offences  of
       these prisoners and the motivation for his decision, as well  as  the
       criteria according to which he granted this pardon;


  (3) in the light of the fact that this pardon was only granted to ANC and
       PAC offenders, urgently requests other political parties to submit  a
       motivated application to the Presidency, and requests  the  President
       to act in such a way as to ensure that this matter does  not  gain  a
       selective political colour in  which  the  political  stance  of  the
       offender becomes the decisive factor; and


  (4) expresses the confidence that this decision by the President will  be
       the beginning of the final closure of the books of the past.]

Mrs F MAHOMED: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting  day  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the South African  National  Council  of  Churches  (SACC)
       accused some churches of failing to contribute to the  fight  against
       Aids by discouraging the use of condoms;


  (2) believes that the message of encouraging protected  sex  through  the
       use of a condom is an integral part of the most  effective  component
       of the fight against the spread of the disease and ensuring that  the
       youth in particular take responsibility to fight the spread  of  this
       pandemic;


  (3) echoes the stance taken by the SACC; and


  (4) calls on the said churches to join the partnership against the spread
       of HIV/Aids and to spread the message of protected sex especially  to
       that segment of our population which is very sexually active.

Adv P S SWART: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  siting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the recent statement by Safety and  Security  Minister  Charles
       Nqakula that the regular release of crime statistics  can  demoralise
       society;
  (2) reminds him that his predecessor's moratorium on statistics  in  2001
       had a negative impact on public morale;


  (3) notes that, due to the hard work of the SAPS, crime  stabilised  with
       slight decreases in some crimes during 2001;


  (4) congratulates the understaffed and overworked  police  on  these  and
       other recent successes and mourns with them the loss  of  colleagues,
       particularly Senior Superintendent Elias Mashau of Diepkloof; and


  (5) calls on the Minister not to  go  underground  in  typical  communist
       fashion,  but  rather  to  opt  for  a  transparent  and  accountable
       department in the interests of the police and the public alike.
[Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:
  That the House -


  (1) applauds the purchase agreement reached in  principle  between  First
       Rand Bank and Saambou's curator, which will circumvent  the  possible
       liquidation of Saambou;


  (2) further applauds the fact that an offer was made in  terms  of  which
       the employees of Saambou can receive full retrenchment packages,  and
       thus avoid the severe consequences of liquidation and the closing  of
       the business; and


  (3) compliments the curator, Mr John Louw, for having secured such a deal
       to assist Saambou employees and clients to get their dues back before
       the new owner takes over.

Mr S B NQODI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that South Africa is the only tourism destination in the  world
       to have increased its market share after the 11 September attack;


  (2) recognises that tourists in South Africa  have  defied  the  negative
       image of our country that certain members of the opposition  like  to
       paint, instead finding on our shores and in our heartland a safe  and
       welcoming land, beset by many challenges but facing up to its  future
       with optimism, courage and creativity;


  (3) thanks all the tourists who have visited us for seeing for themselves
       the pleasure that our country has to offer and for rating our country
       as a safe destination; and


  (4)  extends  its  open  arms  to  all  future  tourists  and  bids  them
       ``siyanamkela'' [welcome].
[Applause.]

Mr J SCHIPPERS: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  nearly 2 000 people will lose their jobs because of the collapse
           of Saambou;


       (b)  many families will lose a substantial amount of their income, or
           even the only income they receive; and


       (c)  Saambou's collapse was caused by poor corporate  governance  and
           weak decision-making by the top management; and


  (2) appeals to the curator, Mr John Louw, and the respective unions to -


       (a)  bear in mind the trauma currently experienced  by  the  affected
           families during their retrenchment package negotiations; and


       (b)  negotiate reasonable severance packages.

                    TRIBUTE TO SLAIN POLICEMEN AND WOMEN

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the  ANC,

That the House -


     (1)    notes that friends and family from all over gathered in Pretoria
         on Sunday at a memorial service attended  by  Safety  and  Security
         Minister, the  honourable  Charles  Nqakula,  the  National  Police
         Commissioner and Gauteng Premier Mbhazima Shilowa;


     (2)    recalls that 163 police members were murdered in  2001,  and  31
         have been murdered in 2002;


     (3)    calls on all who seek a developed South Africa that is safe  for
         our people to assist  the  police  to  do  their  work,  and  offer
         whatever  support  they  are  able  to  through  participation   in
         community police forums, neighbourhood watches and volunteering  at
         their local police stations;


     (4)    pays tribute to those who fell in the course of  their  duty  in
         fighting crime; and


     (5)    accords them the honour they deserve for sacrificing their lives
         for the good of the people and development of our country.

Agreed to.

                     DEATH OF MRS FIKILE REGINA MATTHEWS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:
  That the House -


  (1) expresses its deep regret and sadness at  the  death  of  Mrs  Fikile
       Regina Matthews;


  (2) conveys its sincere condolences to her daughter  Mrs  Naledi  Pandor,
       Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces,  her  husband,  the

  (3) affirms the great affection and esteem in which she was held  by  all
       those who knew her; and


  (4) expresses its gratitude for her life of outstanding loyalty and close
       association with the  struggle  for  freedom  and  democracy  in  our
       country.
Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 21 - Defence:

The MINISTER  OF  DEFENCE:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members  of  the  National
Assembly and invited guests, last year we identified five challenges  facing
the Department of Defence. They were, firstly,  to  maintain  a  core  force
that is able  to  meet  its  commitments  to  deal  with  a  wide  range  of
contingencies. The force must have the capacity to expand to an  appropriate
size when necessary, to be able to mount peace support operations,  as  well
as support for the SAPS for social services.

To date we have deployed 930 members of  the  SA  Defence  Force  in  United
Nations, Organisation of African Unity and other missions  covering  a  wide
range of tasks, including military  liaison  officers,  military  observers,
staff officers, specialised teams, protection services and general  military
assistance. Members of the SANDF are  deployed  in  Uganda,  the  Democratic
Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Algeria, the Comoros and Burundi.  The
SANDF  is  also  participating  in  SADC  initiatives  to  render   planning
assistance to  the  Lesotho  Defence  Force  for  support  during  Lesotho's
national elections this month.

We will also be supporting the SA  Police  Service  and  the  Department  of
Foreign Affairs in the inauguration of the  African  Union  during  June  in
Durban,  and  during  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable   Development   in
Johannesburg in August.

The second challenge was the alignment of policy and budget. This  has  been
a problem that we have been grappling  with  for  some  time.  The  mismatch
between defence policy and our Defence budget allocation has  forced  us  to
re-examine our overall strategy with an aim  of  becoming  affordable  while
still being able to deliver an effective Defence Force.

When the department, services and divisions drew up  a  force  structure  to
meet the needs determined  by  our  policy,  its  estimated  cost  was  R4,1
billion over its budget allocation. It has now been redrawn and  is  in  the
final stages of discussion. Some hard decisions will have  to  be  made  and
the proposal will be taken to Cabinet and Parliament before implementation.

The third challenge continues to be the absorption of  new  technology.  New
technology, embodied in the  weapons  system  being  delivered  through  the
strategic  defence  packages  impact  on  every  aspect  of  defence,   from
technical training and human resource planning to maintenance;  and  from  a
provisioning system, ie supply lines, spares, etc, to a new  infrastructure,
ie buildings, reticulation and storage. The  Chiefs  of  the  Navy  and  Air
Force have been working for the past 18 months on plans to  accommodate  and
absorb the new equipment. Plans in this regard  will  be  presented  to  the
portfolio committees during this parliamentary session.

The  fourth  challenge  was  the  need  to  develop  capacity   to   respond
effectively to our changing regional situation. The situation in our  region
is changing constantly. This time last year no one could have  guessed  that
Angola would be ending its civil war, that the  DRC  peace  talks  would  be
inching forward in Sun City and Pretoria, and that Zimbabwe would be  trying
to overcome its polarisation following its  recent  presidential  elections.
Democratic elections  are  taking  place  continually  throughout  the  SADC
region and the next in line is Lesotho.

The fifth challenge was  to  qualitatively  increase  the  capacity  of  the
Defence  Secretariat.  This   includes   managing   problems   of   resource
management, problems of transition identified  in  the  ministerial  inquiry
and the new service system. The ministerial inquiry, which was set up  after
the Tempe and Phalaborwa shootings, identified a number  of  specific  areas
that needed attention. The  department  has  systematically  and  concretely
responded in detail to that report. Consequently, the atmosphere in  the  SA
National Defence Force has improved immensely.

However, the problems of crime within the department continue to plague  us.
The control mechanisms that are in place are proving inadequate.  Divisional
managers  still  have  to  take  full  count  for  safeguarding  the  assets
entrusted to them. Military discipline still needs to  be  internalised  and
buttressed. We are putting much effort into dealing with these problems  and
expect to turn that situation around inside of the next four to six  months.
We have now taken the necessary steps to  strengthen  the  secretariat  with
the appointment of the chief financial officer and the  appointment  of  the
chief of policy and planning. The departmental strategic plan is  the  first
result of these changes.

Defence is a  large  and  complicated  machine.  Over  and  above  its  four
services and 14 divisions -  finance,  logistics,  intelligence,  personnel,
joint  support,  joint  operations,  corporate  communications,  chaplaincy,
military police, joint training, foreign relations, equal opportunities  and
affirmative action, and acquisitions - it has  its  own  language,  its  own
traditions and culture. Over  the  last  eight  years,  we  have  worked  at
cultivating  an  integrated  Defence  Force,  a  new  military  culture  and
policies that are appropriate to a democratic society. Our efforts  are  now
bearing fruit and we  are  picking  up  speed.  It  has  been  an  extremely
difficult task to turn around this complex and costly machine.

We have no choice but to constantly educate and  re-educate  the  public  on
the need for defence capabilities in peacetime and in war.  The  concept  of
security embodied in our Constitution goes beyond mere territorial  defence.
It embraces security of persons, environment, and an end to  human  conflict
and  suffering  generally.  We  are  therefore  constitutionally  bound   to
maintain a force that can produce security and comfort for our populace  and
beyond.

The recent debates on the strategic defence packages  counterpoised  defence
needs to social needs. This is a wrong approach  to  the  question.  Defence
and  social  needs  go  together  because  each  reinforces  the  other.  If
investors must invest and  create  jobs,  they  need  a  secure  and  stable
investment atmosphere in South Africa and  Southern  Africa.  Moreover,  our
coastline of some 3 000 km is our longest frontier and, as we are a  trading
country with marine resources, our harbours are strategic to our survival.

Lastly, as members of the United Nations and  the  Organisation  of  African
Unity, we are deeply committed to the advancement of  world  peace.  Defence
capabilities cannot be turned on and off like a light switch. They  have  to
be  maintained  and  improved  upon  from  day  to  day  and  generation  to
generation. In the globalising unipolar world of  our  day,  September  11th
revealed that even the most powerful nation in the world  cannot  afford  to
wallow in complacency. New threats of a higher calibre  are  always  lurking
somewhere. Our nation must be forever vigilant.

Defence has now reached a turning point. The department is now reaching  its
target  of  transparency  in  defence  management,   good   governance   and
accountability. This is  a  great  step  forward  in  the  building  of  our
democracy. In keeping  with  constitutional  prescripts  and  public  sector
reform initiatives, our medium-term direction for  defence  is  captured  in
the core objectives described in the strategic  plan  tabled  in  Parliament
today.  The  implementation  of  these  objectives  is  reflected   in   the
operational plan for the financial year 2002-03.

These comprehensive plans facilitate direction and control of defence  at  a
political level, by myself, and at the departmental level, by the  Secretary
for Defence and  the  Chief  of  the  National  Defence  Force.  Performance
against  these  plans  will  be  reported  quarterly  to  enable  corrective
measures where necessary. This provides assurance  that  defence  objectives
will be achieved and officials may  be  individually  held  to  account  for
their performance.

To ensure accountability, overall performance against these  plans  will  be
reported in the  defence  annual  report  to  be  tabled  in  Parliament  in
September 2003. This report will include the  prescribed  audited  financial
statements and  the  Auditor-General's  report.  We  intend  to  achieve  an
unqualified financial audit report, as was achieved for the first  time  for
the financial year 2000-01.
In concluding my budget speech last year, I told this House that:


  ... to ensure that we are able to meet the challenges we  face,  we  must
  make the right strategic decisions now. We  must  prioritise  issues  and
  choose what to do with the money we get.

These choices have now been identified and we  have  defined  precisely  how
our goals are to be achieved. We are putting together  a  new  force  design
and structure that will both enable  us  to  carry  put  our  constitutional
obligations in the widest sense, whilst being affordable.

A proposal will be tabled before Cabinet whose salient points  will  include
the comprehensive  military  strategy  that  has  been  drawn  up  based  on
available  resources,  Government  priorities  and  likely  expectations  of
defence. The  strategy  takes  into  account  the  importance  of  promoting
regional security,  regional  peacekeeping  initiatives,  support  to  other
Government departments like Foreign Affairs, Trade and  Industry,  etc,  and
the maintenance of  basic  capabilities  in  the  event  of  a  conventional
conflict.

Factors critical to the effectiveness of such a force are, to a large  part,
financially  determined.  Some  of  those  factors  are  that  the   defence
allocation should maintain its level; the new human resource  strategy  must
be  drawn  up,  approved  and  implemented;  and   that   routine   internal
deployments must be phased out in the next six years.

There are thus a number of measures that need to be taken  to  effect  these
changes,  ranging  from   interservice   co-operation,   outsourcing,   core
location, elimination of duplication and increases in efficiency.

We  have  now  succeeded  in  finalising  the  integration  process.   Seven
different military formations have been brought  together  and  successfully
welded into one SA National Defence Force - a  single  force  representative
of the demographics of our country, uniformly trained, combat ready, with  a
code of conduct and a uniformity of purpose. What remains for us now  is  to
pare the National Defence Force to its correct size and proportions. We  are
embarking on  this  process  of  rationalisation,  guided  by  a  new  human
resource strategy.

I now turn to the strategic defence packages. The levels of  expenditure  of
the Defence public programme have been set out in the  main  Budget  Speech.
Government and departmental expenditure will continue to increase from  this
year's level  of  R6,3  billion  to  the  peak  of  R7,7  billion  in  2005.
Thereafter, expenditure will rapidly decline to under R1,4 billion per  year
based on the present focus of the exchange rate.

The joint investigation  team  made  comprehensive  recommendations  of  the
strategic defence package process. Most of the recommendations  necessitated
policy adaptation. The department and Armscor immediately  embarked  upon  a
complete rewriting of the affected acquisition policy and  the  first  draft
of the new policy is almost ready for discussion. The  recommendations  from
our parliamentary committees will be incorporated into this new policy.

Although only 16% of the defence industrial  participation  obligations  has
presently been contracted, it has already made a considerable impact on  the
design, development and  manufacturing  competencies  and  turnover  of  our
local  defence-related  industry.  The  defence   industrial   participation
obligations have, to date, resulted in the contract to the value of US  $376
million as against a planned target of US $308 million, which means that  we
are presently some 22% ahead of schedule.

As far as national  industrial  participation  is  concerned,  equally  good
progress has been realised. By the end of 2001, some  18  projects  covering
diverse fields like engineering,  aviation,  agriculture  and  beneficiation
had completed the construction  and  investment  phases  and  had  commenced
production. The current level of NIP-related export  and  investment  stands
at US $400 million and are expected to generate some US $5  billion  by  the
year 2004. The first large NIP milestone obligation of some US $3,9  billion
is to be reached in the coming financial year.

In adopting the Constitutive Act of the African Union  in  July  last  year,
African leaders stated as follows, and I quote:


  We are conscious of the fact that the  scourge  of  conflicts  in  Africa
  constitutes a major impediment to the socioeconomic  development  of  the
  continent and of the need to promote peace, security and stability  as  a
  prerequisite for the implementation of our  development  and  integration
  agenda.

It is important to remember that the African Union's  principles  are  based
on a number of antecedents, including those in the security  area.  What  is
new today, however, is that  we  seek  implementation  in  a  post-Cold  War
period,  within  the  reality  of  a  globalising  world  and  a  widespread
commitment among African leaders to democracy. Among the principles  of  the
African Union is the establishment  of  a  common  defence  policy  for  the
African continent.

The Inter-state Defence and Security Committee of SADC  is  working  towards
regional partnership in this regard. It has already adopted  a  draft  of  a
mutual defence pact which aims to eliminate  and  prevent  conflict  in  the
region and ensure collective  approach  to  security.  This  draft  will  be
presented to the heads of state for signing at the SADC  summit  later  this
year.

The key provisions of the draft are military preparedness, a  commitment  to
collective  defence,  defence   co-operation   between   SADC   states   and
compatibility   of   defence   equipment   and   systems,   in   particular,
communications.  The  implication  of  the  pact  plays   an   unconditional
commitment of states to the prevention  of  conflict  to  ensure  peace  and
stability and security in  the  SADC  region.  Central  to  the  success  of
collective defence and security is the  will  and  ability  of  SADC  member
states to enforce the pact.

How does defence envisage operationalising Nepad? The key is to ensure  that
defence efforts are put behind the implementation of Nepad.  We  must  build
the capacity of regional organisations to implement the provisions  of  this
pact. We  must  build  the  capacity  of  national  governments  to  improve
security processes. The joint security commissions set up between  Botswana,
Namibia, Mozambique and  Lesotho  will  facilitate  a  common  understanding
among SADC states of  the  need  for  strong  civil  military  relations  as
fundamental to the working of a democratic state.

In conclusion, my thanks go to the whole of the department, the SA  National
Defence Force, the  Secretariat,  the  Ministry,  Armscor,  BMATT,  advisory
bodies and committees,  NGOs,  universities  and  other  sections  of  civil
society. Special thanks to the hon Ntsiki Mashimbye, the outgoing  chair  of
the now disbanded Joint Standing Committee on Defence  ...  [Interjections.]
It is not disbanded. I apologise. He is the outgoing chair of that  standing
committee. Special thanks also go to all  hon  members  who  serve  on  that
committee. It has a proud record. My thanks also goes to Mr Mokoena and  the
Select Committee on Security and Constitutional  Affairs.  And,  as  always,
thanks to the chair of the portfolio committee, Ms Thandi  Modise,  and  her
committee. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, on behalf of  the
members of the House, may  I  congratulate  the  Defence  Force  Choir  that
performed in the precincts today. Their performance was both stupendous  and
magnificent, and you may say that to them. Thank you! [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, modesty prevents us  from  responding.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Chairperson, hon members, ladies and  gentlemen,  I  am  sure
that the Deputy President is  as  impressed  as  I  am  by  the  magnificent
uniforms of the SA National Defence Force. [Applause.]

My respect goes to the fallen men and women in uniform who have  lost  their
lives  in  defence  and  service  of  the  democratic  South   Africa.   Our
condolences go, in particular, to the families of Makhado and  Mbuyaza,  and
we  hope  that  those  who  were  injured  in  the  Burundi  shootings   are
recovering. This Defence Budget Vote is the first  one  that  Comrade  Steve
Tshwete misses, and we shall miss him too.

Allow me to congratulate the Minister, who for the first time qualified  the
Auditor-General's report. Clearly, we are on the right track. [Applause.]

In his speech, the Minister of Defence quotes from the  African  leaders  on
the occasion of the launch of the Constitutive Act  of  the  African  Union,
saying:


  We are conscious of the fact that  the  scourge  of  conflict  in  Africa
  constitutes a major impediment to the socioeconomic  development  of  the
  continent and of the need to promote peace, security and stability  as  a
  prerequisite for the implementation of our  development  and  integration
  agenda.


So, we know that stability, security,  peace  and  development  are  on  the
agenda of the AU. We also know that the integration of values  and  systems,
as well as cultures and beliefs of the people of Africa are on that  agenda.
The Minister further spoke about South Africa's role  in  the  SADC  region.
The need to create conditions conducive to law and order,  stability,  peace
and development cannot  be  overemphasized  if  we  are  serious  about  the
democratisation of this region.

If  South  Africa  congratulates  herself  on  the  leading  role   in   the
democratisation of the continent  and  the  re-emergence  of  Africa  as  an
economic development site, South Africa then needs to consider the  need  to
contribute   towards   the   conditions   that   are   conducive   to   that
democratisation.
That contribution should not just  be  in  speeches  in  this  House  or  in
debates around the academic elite of this  country.  We  need  to  translate
this contribution into tasks and  roles.  These  tasks  and  roles  must  be
reflected  in  the  Defence  Budget.  My  colleagues  will  speak   on   the
contribution of Defence to Nepad.

The defence agreement which the Minister is talking about -  which  will  be
signed later this year - moves us practically  towards  preventing  conflict
in the  region.  It  moves  us  towards  the  common  defence  policies  and
compatible  equipment  and  systems.  This  means  that  equipment  systems'
language will be standardised.

South  Africa  has  the  largest  defence  industry  on  the  continent  and
therefore stands to benefit as the only industry in the defence  field  when
standardisation takes place. The common defence  policies  in  SADC  and  in
West Africa are but the stepping  stones  towards  the  continental  defence
policy.

We would be naive if we in Africa, especially in South  Africa,  think  that
we should not spend on defence. If anything,  the  events  of  11  September
questions the ability of the SANDF to protect the sovereignty and  integrity
of the Republic. How ready are we? What do we have that will make sure  that
we do not have opportunists trying to get in and  out  of  this  country  as
they did in America? We need to sharpen our ability to  collect  information
and increase our agility to  protect  the  lives  and  properties  of  South
Africans.

This brings me to the question which I raised in the budget debate  of  2000
and 2001, on Defence intelligence. The age, numbers, racial, geographic  and
gender spread of this component of the Defence  Force  needs  to  be  looked
into. The Chief of the SANDF is the overall Chief of Defence and  cannot  be
exempted from being held responsible for whatever happens in that  division.


Therefore, stories of victimisation of the ex-nonstatutory members  must  be
looked into. Are they just stories?  Why  are  the  cases  of  victimisation
increasing? Why are these spreading  and  why  are  we  not  listening?  The
Defence Intelligence  falls  under  the  oversight  of  the  Joint  Standing
Committee on Intelligence, but the Portfolio Committee on Defence still  has
the budgetary responsibility.

Last year I vowed, standing on this podium,  that  we  would  not  agree  to
budget  items  under  Defence  Intelligence,  unless  the   Joint   Standing
Committee on Intelligence tells us to do so.  This  time  around  they  have
assured us that we should agree and we have agreed.

However, one needs to consider the centralisation of sensitive  information.
It might be a good thing right now, but it might  also,  in  the  long  run,
prove to be a weakness of this Government.

South Africa needs  to  recognise  that  the  DOD  is  one  of  its  largest
employers. It gives jobs to 70 000 people. It is, therefore, duty  bound  to
contribute towards nation-building and the national skilling  programme.  An
avenue for this has been created via the service corps. This year an  amount
of R46 million has been earmarked for the service corps.

On a recent portfolio committee study tour to Japan,  we  learned  that  the
Japanese Defence Force has its own driving schools. Now, the SANDF does  not
have that. The service corps cannot even impart this skill  to  the  members
who should be benefiting, and keeps on contracting out to people.

One would have assumed that when one legislates in the  draft  defence  Bill
that  members  of  the   Defence   Force   will   carry   driving   licenses
extraordinary, that in  fact,  as  members  enter  the  SANDF,  training  in
driving skills would  be  provided.  [Applause.]  Therefore,  one  does  not
expect to see members leaving the Defence Force still  unable  to  drive  an
ordinary vehicle. It is something which is  very  small,  but  needs  to  be
looked into. One of my colleagues will look into the service corps, ie  what
its weaknesses are and what we think should be done about it.

Now, the Defence Review process of South Africa has been hailed as the  most
progressive in the world. It removed the defence policies  and  issues  from
being the preserve of a few elite and  of  the  military,  and  allowed  for
popular participation of the people.

It transferred the label of the people's Defence Force to the  military  and
brought back the histories of the armies of  Sekhukhuni,  Shaka,  Mzilikazi,
Kruger, Moshoeshoe and Makana. It brought back ownership, pride and  respect
of men and women in uniform. This pride and ownership needs to  be  followed
up by recognition in rands and cents. Therefore, when we have to  spend,  we
must spend.

The Minister referred to the  need  to  bring  policies,  force  design  and
budget into line. We agree with that, and we believe that a  review  of  the
Defence Review is necessary. We, however, do not  agree  with  the  Minister
that the military must review themselves without inputs from the  public  or
public representatives. Restructuring to enhance functional and  operational
efficiency is the preserve of the Department of Defence. Restructuring  that
causes major policy changes  is  not  the  preserve  of  the  Department  of
Defence. [Applause.]

We need to learn from the example of Nigeria  how  little  things  that  are
overlooked  in  the  current  can   acquire   serious   racial,   geo-ethnic
connotations and become  problematic  in  the  future.  We  agree  that  the
Defence Secretariat needs to be strengthened.

The Budget shows that R6,3 million has been put aside for the reserve  force
management. This figure is way below the R39 million set  aside  for  policy
and planning, and way below the  R56,7  million  set  aside  for  the  legal
services. This matter concerns us. If we are true to the one-force  concept,
why are we only putting aside R6,3 million for the reserve forces,  or  have
I read the budget wrongly?

Secondly, the legal services figure shows  that  most  of  the  department's
money is spent on legal matters. Of course, this would make  sense  if  this
figure also reflects the amount of money spent on the restructuring  of  the
Military Justice System. However, if this R56,7  million  does  not  reflect
the restructuring of  the  Military  Justice  System,  then  I  have  a  big
problem.

I have a big problem, because this means that people in  the  Defence  Force
are still subject to the  old  court  martial  system,  and  that  would  be
unfair. I would link this to a lot of mistrials, particularly a case of  one
Keswa, an ex-Tempe-based member of the SANDF, who was  tried  in  Afrikaans,
which he could not understand. He was thrown  out  of  the  system  and  the
whole matter was heard in exactly five minutes.

We have raised a number of similar cases. These cases need to  be  reviewed.
People cannot just be thrown out  because  of  unjust  systems.  [Applause.]
Whether we are talking about justice in the Defence Force or  in  the  civil
world out there, it still needs to be fair. People need  to  feel  that,  in
fact, they have been heard  properly  and  that  they  have  been  convicted
properly.
I do not want the politicians to keep on bringing up these matters,  nor  do
I want to keep on acting on behalf of  ex-members  of  the  SANDF.  However,
there is a limit to what we should do, and we need to be guided. When  cases
such as the case involving the aforementioned Keswa  come  to  the  fore,  I
cannot stand aside and say that because I am not involved in the  department
I can do nothing for Keswa. It pains me to admit that there are many  Keswas
out there who are being thrown out of the system. [Applause.]

The perception of racial discrimination has to be  looked  into.  We  cannot
continue pretending, for instance, that unhappiness within  the  ranks,  low
morale, even amongst the middle management of the Defence Force, is  not  an
issue that should concern us, nor should we continue to leave the  issue  of
the Cape Corps hanging. It needs to be concluded. We need to bring  finality
to these issues and close the chapter on them.

During the budget hearings the committee  also  heard  about  the  continued
theft and loss of property within the Department of  Defence.  These  losses
are too high, and steps need to be taken to stop them.

Care needs  to  be  taken  when  we  rightsize  because  the  experience  of
countries with more peacekeeping experience shows that one needs  to  treble
the force that one deploys internationally at any given  time.  Peacekeeping
is new to us. It is happening. I am sure we are  preparing  for  this  role,
but have we dedicated personnel and resources specifically for this role?

After World War II Japan opted for a defensive posture, and  she  only  sent
her troops on noncombat peacekeeping  missions.  South  Africa  -  at  least
Parliament - has not considered this. We have not even  made  a  distinction
between peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace  enforcement.  We  need  to  sit
down and make up our minds as to what roles we definitely would not want  to
engage in when we send away our peacekeeping forces in future.

South Africa has a Defence Force with four arms of  service.  Chapter  1  of
the White Paper on Defence says that the Defence Force shall be a  balanced,
modern, affordable and technologically advanced military force,  capable  of
executing its tasks, duties,  effectively  and  efficiently.  The  strategic
defence packages are simply there to make sure that the SA National  Defence
Force is as balanced as per the Defence Review,  the  White  Paper  and  the
Constitution of this country. Therefore, to juxtapose  the  re-equipment  of
SANDF with more houses or more clinics is not correct. We need both,  we  do
not need one or the other.

We need to accept that the price  has  become  a  bit  higher  than  it  was
initially calculated. However, South Africa now lives within  the  community
of nations and South Africa wanted, and has a free market  system.  We  must
have a defence force, we must have bread,  houses,  schools,  jobs,  and  we
must have flowers. However, we must also equip our Defence Force because  we
agreed that we wanted a balanced, technologically advanced Defence Force.

To get all these is to get stability. To get stability is  to  work  towards
the development we need in the country and in the region. And  that  is  our
contribution towards the Nepad initiative. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Chairperson,  it  is  extremely  ironic  that  in  the  new
democratic South Africa, defence spending has risen  to  similar  importance
as to that found during the previous dispensation. In fact,  the  Department
of Defence has been allocated the second  biggest  budget,  totalling  R18,4
billion. The following disconcerting issues need to be mentioned:

Firstly, a review  of  the  Defence  Review  needs  to  be  undertaken.  The
scandalous arms deal and  the  deployments  in  Burundi  and  the  DRC  have
indicated that the design and structure of the National Defence  Force  need
to be reformulated.

Secondly, incidents in Burundi and the DRC provide reason to reconsider  the
deployment of our troops in these countries,  especially  in  light  of  the
expensive and failed DRC conference at Sun City.

Thirdly, the shocking findings of the joint investigative team  released  in
November last year clearly implicated  Government  and  definitely  did  not
exonerate it. The suspension of the  former  Chief  Whip  of  the  ANC;  the
resignation of Mr Shaik as the Chief Acquisition Officer; the  arrest  of  a
managing  director  of  a  well-known  German  company  and  his  subsequent
prosecution, all indicate that the Cabinet should never have  been  involved
in the process of selecting the various contractors.

Government has indicated to the public that the cost of  the  arms  deal  is
R52,7 billion. Whilst the figure can rapidly double owing  to,  inter  alia,
finance costs, Government has thus far failed to inform  the  public  as  to
the full expected costs of the arms deal to the tax-payer. Spending  on  the
arms deal for this year only stands at R7,6 billion, whilst  the  Department
of Education has been allocated a mere R8,8 billion and  the  Department  of
Health a total of R7,1 billion - this against the total  Defence  budget  of
R18 billion.

The  service  corps  has,  despite  its  widely  publicised  failings,  been
allocated an amount of R46 million for the continuation  of  its  disastrous
attempts to provide skills to those who leave the SANDF.

Military trade unions have been spiralling out of control owing to poor,  if
not nonexistent human resource practices. The Minister appears  to  conduct,
with due respect, a closed-door policy on this issue. Issues  pertaining  to
the Black, Indian, Coloured Forum and the SANDF former members'  union  have
still not been resolved.

Personnel expenditure, with the exclusion of the arms  deal,  is  quoted  at
52% of the total budget, which is simply caused by  too  many  generals  and
senior staff within the department.

Theft and loss of military property remains  unacceptably  high.  There  are
reports of Defence Force members being involved  in  the  theft  of  Defence
Force property, where property has inexplicably gone missing.  As  indicated
in the media yesterday, highlighting a series of  break-ins  into  Denel  in
Centurion is a cause for concern.

The removal of the permanent force element from the border  patrols  in  the
Eastern Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal borders is causing alarm  amongst
small-scale and large-scale  stock  farmers.  They  want  these  patrols  to
remain.

An unexplained delay caused by alleged differences between  members  of  the
ANC  and  the  Minister  of  Education,  as  Chairperson  of  the   National
Conventional Arms Control Council, has led to the the National  Conventional
Arms Control Bill not being adopted by Parliament, despite it  being  passed
by the Defence committee.

This Bill, which aims to regulate the  council  and  to  declare  authorised
sales of defence equipment to other countries, and despite  being  scheduled
to be debated during the first term, no indication has yet been received  as
to whether it will be put to the vote in Parliament during this term, if  at
all.  This  impasse,  at  a  time  when  specialised  units  are   presently
investigating the alleged  involvement  of  Armscor  and  its  officials  in
selling,  illegally,  missile  technology  to  Chile,  remains  a   mystery.
[Applause.]

Mr  V   B   NDLOVU:   Sihlalo,   mhlonishwa   Phini   likaMongameli   neNdlu
ehloniphekileyo,  okokuqala,  ngifuna  ukukhuluma  ngokuthengwa  kwezikhali.
[Chairperson, hon Deputy President and  the  honourable  House,  firstly,  I
want to talk about the purchasing of weapons.]

I would like to register my party's strong reservations about  the  way  the
procurement arms deal has been dealt with, especially when it comes  to  the
people who were mentioned as culprits relating to wrongdoings in this  deal.
Some are resigning and running  away  because  they  do  not  want  to  face
prosecution departmentally or otherwise. My party is against the  manner  in
which this deal was conducted, but we  are  supportive  of  acquiring  arms.
After 11 September nobody can blame South Africa for acquiring  proper  arms
to protect the citizens of the country.
The peace missions, the United Nations declaration of a ceasefire should  be
the priority in any country where  we  want  to  deploy  armed  forces.  The
Minister, together with the President, must be very careful not  to  play  a
Big Brother role to  other  African  countries,  because  others  would  not
appreciate it. Whether or not there is any need to deploy armed  forces,  we
should do that under the auspices of the United Nations for our protection.

Any financial obligation we as a  country  has  undertaken  should  be  paid
back. We must not become a charity organisation or  a  charity  country.  We
have our own problems of massive unemployment  and  crime.  I  am  referring
here to the Burundi agreement where Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria  have  agreed
that they would communicate and help us in putting arms there,  which  I  do
not think they are doing at this moment.

The end of March 2002 was the last date for dealing with the termination  of
the integration process. As we speak the department should be  preparing  to
demobilise those who require the scheme. The end of December 2002 should  be
the last day, because this has gone on for a long time. My party  has  taken
this position or stand because we believe that everybody should now have  an
equal chance or opportunity  of  getting  into  the  Defence  Force  without
favours. Everybody should qualify once and for all.

On the question of the strength of the armed forces, from  ancient  time  to
the present day the defence force vote in any country  has  always  remained
the same: it is for defending the sovereignty and territory  of  a  country,
as well as peacekeeping duties and all natural  disasters.  To  achieve  all
these the Army, Air Force and the naval force should work together in  close
partnership.  Our  Defence  Force  must   be   empowered   to   fulfil   its
constitutional   mandate   by   upholding   its   adequate   strength    and
professionality. The strength of our  army  should  take  into  account  the
socioecomic variety of South African society, as well as  its  position  and
monetary responsibility on the subcontinent of Africa.

Our portfolio  committee  took  all  these  factors  into  account  when  we
proposed that the total strength of our army, after the  completion  of  our
restructuring process, should be 75 000 uniformed  personnel.  The  IFP  was
therefore completely taken aback to learn that the  department  has  reduced
the figure to less than 60 000 uniformed personnel. For  a  country  of  our
size and potential economic growth, this is definitely unacceptable  to  the
IFP.

On the issue of the transfer of army personnel to the SAPS, the 7  000  army
soldiers that the department wants to transfer to the  police  must  not  be
criminals. They should also be healthy, because the police will  not  accept
rejects  from  the  Army.  [Laughter.]  Secondly,  these  people   must   be
transferred with their financial packages, in order not to upset the  police
budget. For the benefit of those who would be transferred,  they  should  be
shown the job description of their new department, so  that  they  can  make
their own decision on the matter.

It is recommended that the Department of  Defence  employ  young  people  in
order to fulfil its obligations. Because of the peacekeeping phenomenon,  it
is proper for the Department of Defence to  employ  young  people  or  young
soldiers and teach them the new  skills  of  peacekeeping  and  respect  for
individuals and the Bill of Rights.

On the question of theft and  losses,  the  department,  the  Minister,  the
Chief of the Army and the Secretariat should make sure that they  catch  the
criminals. It is annoying to hear  the  department  saying  that  there  are
people who are stealing from it, but they do not  know  who  they  are.  The
phenomenon where people think that they can  steal  and  get  away  with  it
should not succeed. Therefore the people who are stealing  the  property  of
the Government must be arrested, prosecuted and languish in jail  for  doing
so.

An HON MEMBER: Why?

Mr V B NDLOVU: Because they have been stealing  things  ...  [Laughter]  ...
that is why!
The IFP will not  allow  the  situation  where  people  can  get  away  with
stealing  Government  property.  Therefore,  it  has  to  stop  as  soon  as
possible.

Ngithi  kumhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe  kusemqoka  lokhu  esikushoyo  ngoba  uma
abantu bezovuka njalo ekuseni beze emsebenzini, kuthi uma sebehamba  bahambe
nefosholo ngalinye, ngakusasa kube yisipedi ngolunye usuku  kube  yimfoloko,
kuyogcina ngokuthi bantshontshe ugandaganda. [Uhleko.]  Kusemqoka-ke  ukuthi
amasosha abone ukuthi yizwe lawo leli esikhuluma  ngalo  futhi  yizwe  lethu
leli  esikhuluma  ngalo.  Akukhona  ukuhlanipha  ukuthi  sithi  sibathembile
ngokuthi kufuneka bavikele izwe lethu  bona  bese  bebona  imboni  okufuneka
bebe kuyo. Kungokokuqala lokho.

Okwesibili,  ngithi  kuNgqongqoshe  kungubuhlakani  ukuthi   amasosha   akhe
amancane, lawa aqashwayo, akubone  kufanele  ukuthi  azihloniphe.  Namhlanje
izingane zethu zifa zincane ngoba uma amasosha ethunyelwe  ezindaweni  lapho
ezokuba khona kude nemindeni  aye  abone  sengathi  kufanele  azichachazele,
aphile noma yikanjani ngoba nakhu engamasosha. Kuyingozi lokho ngoba  umuntu
namhlanje kufuneka azigade yena ngoba  uma  ehluleka  ukuzigada,  siyosukuma
thina  lapha  eNdlini  sibhekise  ikhanda  phansi   bese   sithi:   Makalale
ngokuthula.  Amen,  inkosi  ibusise.   [Ihlombe.]   (Translation   of   Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to say to the hon Minister that this is  an  important  issue.
People will get up in the morning to go to work, and when they return  home,
each one of them goes home with a spade, the following day a  spade  and  on
the next day a fork. They will steal a tractor in the  end.  [Laughter.]  It
is important that soldiers should realise that this is  their  country  that
we are talking about. It is unwise that while we entrust them with  the  job
of protecting our country, they  instead  see  a  factory  from  which  they
should steal. That is the first thing.

Secondly, I would like to say to the Minister that it is wise for his  young
soldiers, the ones that are being recruited, to  respect  themselves.  Today
our children are dying at an early age because when soldiers are sent  to  a
particular place where they will be far  from  their  families,  they  think
that they could act anyhow, and live anyhow just because they are  soldiers.
That is dangerous because one should look after oneself. If one fails to  do
that, we will stand up in this House to bow  our  heads  and  say:  Rest  in
peace. Amen, God bless. Applause.]]

[Mr K W MORWAMOCHE: Mr Chairperson and hon members of this House,  the  main
task of our  Defence  Force  is  the  protection  of  the  country  and  its
inhabitants, from the air to the sea. Our Defence Force assists  the  police
force to combat crime and to fulfil the requirements  of  law  and  justice.
The Defence Force fulfils the requirements of the  Freedom  Charter  of  the
ANC, which stipulates that the people shall govern. Even at  Sekhukhune,  at
night, when we hear a strange sound we know that it is not made by an  enemy
but by a grandchild. That does not mean that it is a free for all, and  that
we forget to pay our taxes, which is what  the  soldiers  are  against.  Our
democracy is protected due to the fact our Defence Force  is  loyal.  During
elections our Defence Force keeps watch over  the  voting  stations  in  the
areas that are under traditional  leaders  where  there  are  no  roads  and
bridges. When the electoral officers find it difficult to access the  voting
stations, our Defence Force helps them by providing transport.

This department understands  the  saying:  ``Leave  the  cow  and  grab  the
person.'' It means batho pele [people  first].  During  times  of  disaster,
this department helps the people who are  experiencing  problems  of  floods
and bush fires. Our Defence Force not only  helps  the  residents  of  South
Africa, but also the residents of neighbouring states;  when  they  cry  out
for help, they get it. When the  neighbouring  states  become  embroiled  in
civil wars, our Defence Force mediates  in  order  to  bring  peace  and  to
monitor the peace process until it is fully established.

Our air force trains and produces pilots of a high calibre. SAAF pilots  are
well known throughout the world for their competence and  the  high  quality
of their training, which is provided by the South African  National  Defence
Force. This department bears the responsibility of flying our  leaders  when
they have commitments overseas.  This  department  allows  the  soldiers  to
further their studies. However, I would like to know from the Minister  what
method is used when soldiers are permitted to further their studies.

Although this department performs  well,  there  are  areas  that  need  the
Minister's   close   attention,   namely   areas   such   as    integration,
transformation and downsizing. We would also like to thank the Minister  for
redeploying 700 soldiers in the police force. This  is  a  great  advantage,
because the police do not have to start from  scratch  when  training  these
soldiers in police procedures. The issue of  restructuring  also  needs  the
Minister's close attention.  The  issue  of  the  reserve  force,  as  other
members have already commented in this  regard,  also  needs  to  be  looked
into. There is also a need for ombudspersons in the  soldiers'  barracks  to
attend to the soldiers' complaints properly.

I would also like the Minister to look into the issue  of  special  pensions
for former MK and APLA cadres  because  those  children  of  ours  left  the
country and sacrificed themselves to fight for freedom. Now, when  they  are
denied special pensions, this creates a problem because  they  do  not  have
certain educational qualifications. How are  they  expected  to  have  those
qualifications when they were busy fighting for this country?

The Minister will note that we do not wish to see a reduced  defence  force,
because of those who are deployed in offices. When the  department  says  it
has 700 soldiers in a particular area, it must not include  the  clerks  who
work in the Minister's department in that figure. It must only  include  the
soldiers who will save and protect us.

We would like  to  thank  our  soldiers  for  assisting  the  Department  of
Agriculture in the fight  against,  and  the  prevention  of  foot-and-mouth
disease. We would also like to  thank  our  soldiers  for  helping  to  cure
cholera during times of emergency. When  nurses  down  tools,  our  military
doctors are able to help the people admirably.

Because this department does work for other departments,  I  would  like  to
appeal to  the  Minister  of  Finance  to  consider  increasing  the  budget
allocation of this department.

The ANC supports this Budget Vote so  that  the  Minister  may  be  able  to
develop the air force, the helicopter division, the  bomb  detection  squad,
to develop defence technology and to protect our borders.]

Al word ons Minister gehaat of al is hy tussen vyande, hy sal  kan  oorleef.
Maar die pad wat voorlê moet altyd  skoon  wees.  [Applous.]  [Even  if  the
Minister is hated or among enemies, he will be  able  to  survive.  But  the
road ahead must always be clear.] [Applause.]]

Mnr A BLAAS: Mnr die Voorsitter, die geld wat in die  Weermag  se  begroting
vir die bedryf van daarvan toegeken is, is te min. Die agb Minister mag  dit
nie sê nie, net so min as wat hy  'n  amptelike  standpunt  kan  inneem  oor
Zimbabwe. Dit is 'n feit en dit benadeel die paraatheid van die Weermag.

Laat my egter  toe  om  eers  ons  waardering  uit  te  spreek  teenoor  die
personeel van die Weermag en  sy  geaffilieerde  strukture,  asook  die  agb
Minister met die wyse waarop gepoog word om die  Weermag  op  koers  te  hou
binne die beperking van finansies. Ons sal egter  moet  besin  oor  hoe  ons
meer geld vir die funksionering van die Weermag beskikbaar kan maak.

Die opdrag aan die  Weermag  word  afgelei  uit  die  Grondwet  en  uit  die
strategiese beplanningsoorsig. Dit bepaal  magspeile  en  paraatheidsvlakke.
Verskeie wette, voorskrifte en ander direktiewe  bepaal  die  werksprosedure
van die  Weermag.  Verder  is  daar  verskeie  beleidsvoorskrifte  waar  ook
uitvoering aan gegee moet word.

Die totale begroting het in nominale waarde sedert 1990 tot op  datum  seker
verdubbel: van 9,9 miljard tot ongeveer 18,4 miljard. Personeeluitgawes  het
in nominale waardes verdubbel en  styg  van  19%  tot  34%  van  die  totale
begroting. Die kapitaaluitgawes verhoog van 10% tot 18% van  die  begroting.
Oor dieselfde periode het die  bedryfsuitgawes  in  nominale  waarde  basies
konstant gebly en daal dit van 37% tot slegs 25% van die begroting.

In reële terme beteken dit dus dat die geld wat vir  die  funksionering  van
die Weermag geoormerk is, met meer as die helfte verminder  het.  Personeel-
en kapitaaluitgawes erodeer die  bedryfskoste.  Dit  is  kommerwekkend.  Die
Huis moet hiervan kennis neem en die gevolge verstaan: gevolge wat  neerslag
vind in die paraatheid en effektiewe funksionering van ons weermag;  gevolge
wat veroorsaak dat die staat  finansieel  skade  ly;  gevolge  wat  negatief
inwerk op die motivering en moraal van die Weermag.

As daar nie indringend oplossings gevind word nie, help al  die  goeie  werk
wat tans gedoen word en die gesofistikeerde wapentuig wat ons  aankoop,  net
mooi niks nie. Kom ons lig net  'n  paar  voorbeelde  uit.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Mr Chairman, the money allocated in the budget of  the  Defence
Force for its management, is too little. The hon the Minister  may  not  say
this, just as he cannot adopt an official standpoint on Zimbabwe. This is  a
fact and it is to the detriment of the Defence Force.

However, allow me first to express our appreciation  towards  the  staff  of
the Defence Force and its affiliated structures, as  well  as  the  hon  the
Minister, for the way in which they attempt to keep  the  Defence  Force  on
course within its financial limitation.  However,  we  will  have  to  think
about how we are going to make more money available for the  functioning  of
the Defence Force.

The directive to the Defence Force is  derived  from  the  Constitution  and
from the strategic planning review. This determines levels of authority  and
levels of preparedness. Various Acts,  prescriptions  and  other  directives
determine the working procedure of the  Defence  Force.  Furthermore,  there
are various policy directives that must be effected.
The total budget has doubled in its nominal value from 1990  to  date:  from
9,9 billion to approximately 18,4 billion. Personnel expenses  have  doubled
in nominal value and increased from 19% to 34% of the total budget.  Capital
expenditure has increased from 10% to 18%  of  the  budget.  Over  the  same
period operating expenditure has basically  remained  the  same  in  nominal
value and decreased from 37% to only 25% of the budget.

In real terms, therefore, this  means  that  the  money  earmarked  for  the
functioning of the Defence Force has been reduced by more than  half.  Staff
and capital expenditure are eroding the operating costs. This is  cause  for
concern. The House must take note of this and understand  the  consequences:
consequences that manifest themselves  in  the  preparedness  and  effective
functioning  of  our  Defence  Force;  consequences  that  cause  the  state
financial  damage;  consequences  that  have  a  negative  effect   on   the
motivation and morale of the Defence Force.

If decisive solutions are not found, all the good  work  that  is  currently
being done and the sophisticated weaponry that we are purchasing  will  mean
absolutely nothing. Let us highlight only a few examples.]

Important aspects of policy in the White Paper on Defence of  1996  and  the
Defence Review of 1998 are not aligned with developments  in  the  strategic
environment and the defence funding. The present  SANDF's  force  design  is
neither affordable  nor  sustainable  in  accordance  with  the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. Furthermore, the force design cannot fully  meet  the
requirements of the strategic  environment  and  Government-ordered  defence
commitments.

The availability of the reserve force as a contingent-ready force cannot  be
guaranteed. There is a  shortage  of  funds  for  personnel  and  logistical
requirements. The budget cuts  have  debilitated  the  conventional  reserve
force. The deteriorating conditions of the Department of Defence  facilities
is a threat to operational readiness and morale  within  the  Department  of
Defence.

Dit is slegs 'n paar voorbeelde van talle probleme wat ondervind  word.  Die
ouditeur-generaal se verslag vir dié periode wys ook verskeie  tekortkominge
uit, wat die  staat  miljoene  rande  kan  kos.  Dit  is  duidelik  dat  die
begroting onvoldoende is vir die Weermag om al sy opdragte uit te  voer.  'n
Paar opsies om die probleem op te los, word voorgehou: Eerstens behoort  die
Minister van Finansies begrip te toon vir die spesifieke  omstandighede  van
die  Weermag.  Die  integrasie  van   die   nie-statutêre   magte   en   die
rasionalisering van die Weermag is nie normale  aktiwiteite  nie.  Geldelike
voorsiening moet daarvoor gemaak word, sodat die proses afgehandel kan  word
en normale magspeile gehandhaaf kan word.

Die strategiese wapenaankope plaas ook uitermate hoë druk op die  beskikbare
fondse van die  Weermag.  Die  Regering  behoort  weer  na  hul  beleid  oor
betrokkenheid in Afrika te kyk. Die land kan nie alleen die  verantwoordelik
vir stabilisering van die gebied aanvaar nie. As  daar  nie  'n  wil  is  om
interne probleme op te los nie en die  verbintenisse  en  betrokkenheid  van
die rolspelers nie bestaan nie, kan die land nie onbepaald  daar  help  nie.
Daar moet weer na die Witskrif oor  Verdediging  en  die  Verdedigingsoorsig
gekyk word en, indien nodig, aanpassings gemaak word. Feit is dat meer  geld
vir die funksionering van ons Weermag nodig is. Teen die huidige tempo  gaan
ons met  gesofistikeerde  wapens  aan  die  een  kant,  generaals  en  ander
belangrike mense aan die ander kant sit en tussen-in is niks om te  verseker
dat ons 'n parate en  professionele  Weermag  het  nie.  Die  Regering,  die
Weermag en ons as Parlement en die burgers van Suid-Afrika,  moet  besin  en
herbeplan oor waarheen ons met die Weermag op pad is en wat  ons  van  hulle
verwag. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[These are only  a  few  examples  of  the  many  problems  that  are  being
experienced. The Auditor-General's report for this  period  also  highlights
several shortcomings which could cost the state millions  of  rands.  It  is
clear that the budget is insufficient for the Defence Force to  execute  all
of its instructions. A few options to solve this problem are to  be  pointed
out: Firstly, the Minister of Finance should demonstrate some  understanding
for the specific circumstances of the Defence Force. The integration of  the
nonstatutory forces and the rationalisation of the  Defence  Force  are  not
normal activities. Financial  provision  must  be  made  in  order  for  the
process  to  be  completed  and  for  normal  levels  of  authority  to   be
maintained.

The strategic arms purchases are also placing  extremely  high  pressure  on
the available funds  of  the  Defence  Force.  The  Government  should  take
another look at their policy on involvement in Africa.  The  country  cannot
take sole responsibility for stabilising the area. If there is  no  will  to
solve internal problems, and if the commitment and involvement of the  role-
players are nonexistent, the country cannot  indefinitely  assist  there.  A
fresh look should be taken at the White Paper on  Defence  and  the  Defence
Review and, if necessary, adjustments should be made. The fact is that  more
money is necessary for the functioning of our Defence Force. At the  current
rate we will  be  sitting  with  sophisticated  weapons  on  the  one  hand,
generals and other important people on the other, and in between there  will
be nothing to ensure that  we  have  a  prepared  and  professional  Defence
Force. The Government, the Defence Force and we as Parliament,  as  well  as
the citizens of South Africa,  must  contemplate  and  plan  anew  regarding
where we are heading with the Defence Force and  what  we  expect  of  them.
[Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, are you getting  a
much better quality of sound, as  I  am  getting  here  in  the  Chair?  The
technicians have had to get some maintenance work done.  Are  you  all  much
happier now? [Interjections.] Thank you.

Adv Z L MADASA: Mr Chairperson, we support the Defence Force budget  because
we would like the Defence Force to succeed. There is no doubt that the  role
of our Defence Force is increased by the conflicts in the region and  Nepad.


However, we would like to raise certain administrative  and  policy  issues.
Transformation and rationalisation  are  still  problematic  in  the  SANDF.
Whilst the top echelons of the army are generally happy, there  are  serious
problems in the rank and file. Allegations of victimisation  still  persist.
I have personally met a young man in East London who told  me  that  he  had
left the army because he would not tolerate strange methods  of  punishment.
He told me that he was still required, when filling  in  a  leave  form,  to
state which force he belonged to  before  integration.  To  deal  with  this
problem, I would therefore like to recommend the establishment  of  a  fully
fledged ombudsman's office along the Canadian system.

On the one hand there are frustrations that transformation is slow,  and  on
the  other  one   there   are   concerns   about   uncertainties   regarding
rationalisation.

Ill discipline is still rife in  the  army.  There  is  slow  resolution  of
transformation  and  rationalisation  issues  which  have  precipitated  ill
discipline. There is a large volume of unresolved disciplinary  cases.  When
asked about this question last year, the hon Minister stated that there  was
a problem in the legal department. My question today is  whether  the  legal
department is now fully organised.

There is still a problem with low morale. According to the department's  own
statistics, the suicide rate, although not alarmingly high, is  a  permanent
feature.

On the issue of future combat readiness, which is an issue that has  already
been mentioned here by previous  speakers,  there  is  a  concern  that  the
average age of a member of the Defence Force is  40-plus,  and  experts  say
that it is an ageing force - I do not know.

In conclusion,  in  support  of  Nepad,  the  department  should  positively
initiate policy positions in the SADC region  and  the  continent  at  large
with regard to common defence and security policies. Increasingly  countries
worldwide are taking regional positions with  regard  to  conflicts  in  the
world.  I  was  happy  to  hear  the  Minister  mentioning  that  there  are
developments in this regard.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF  DEFENCE:  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
members, when South Africans gathered in Kliptown at  the  Congress  of  the
People in 1955, they declared, and I quote:


  The people shall govern. There shall be houses. The doors of learning and
  culture shall be opened. There shall be peace, security and comfort.

In 1996, the people spoke  through  their  Parliament  -  this  House.  They
declared, and I quote:


  Defence must serve to uphold peace and security in a  democratic  society
  so as to create a stable environment for the improvement of our  people's
  lives and for the development and progress of our country.

They said:
  The  SA  National  Defence  Force  shall  have  a   primarily   defensive
  orientation and posture and  be  fully  subordinate  and  accountable  to
  Parliament  and  the  executive.  South  Africa  shall  pursue   peaceful
  relations with other states.

The people declared that the preferred and  primary  cause  of  self-defence
was to prevent conflict and war. That means that South Africa will  turn  to
military means only  as  a  last  resort,  when  deterrence  and  nonviolent
strategies have failed. We solemnly hope that  that  day  will  never  come.
They  said  the  SA  Defence  Force  they  wanted   would   be   integrated,
transformed, representative and at peace with  the  world.  They  wanted  an
SANDF that understood that it had a role to play in the  reconstruction  and
development programme, the RDP.

This is the basis on  which  the  task  of  fundamentally  transforming  the
Department of Defence has proceeded, from  the  understanding  that  defence
encompasses human security, linking the needs to secure  our  citizens  from
all types of enemies,  including  disease,  unemployment,  lack  of  skills,
unequal access to resources and poverty, with that of contributing to  world
peace.

Some of the guiding principles for the transformation and  integration  are,
firstly, sound civil-military  relations;  secondly,  Defence  as  the  core
business of the DOD, thirdly, alignment with the National  Policy  Framework
and, fourthly, maximisation of collateral utility.

Transformation must at all times be guided  by  the  principle  of  civilian
oversight and scrutiny. This stresses the importance  of  strengthening  the
Defence Secretariat, as the Minister has said, so that it  can  perform  its
task. Sound civil-military relations entail also a vibrant interaction  with
civil society, as was demonstrated during the Defence Review process.

In the Defence Review process of 1996  a  number  of  Defence  Force  design
options were developed. These reflected different permutations of  level  of
defence, defence posture and cost. Parliament and  Cabinet  approved  option
one, subject to available finances. Option one provides  a  core  capability
with growth potential.

Although this option was conceded sufficient to maintain  the  core  defence
capability, the  approval  did  not  constitute  blanket  approval  for  all
implied capital projects, nor was it an immutable contract in terms  of  the
exact numbers and types of equipment. At best, it  constituted  approval  in
principle  for  the  maintenance  of  the  specified  capabilities   at   an
approximate level.

This design was the basis for  the  development  of  the  Strategic  Defence
Package which the Minister  referred  to  in  his  speech.  Apart  from  the
required capabilities, the budget allocation at the time indicated a  figure
of  70 000  full-time  Defence  Force  members,  including  civilians.  This
Defence Force was found to be unaffordable and  unsustainable  as  its  cost
turned out to be approximately  R4  100  million  over  the  Defence  budget
allocation,  which  included  the  allocation  for  the  Strategic   Defence
Package.

The proposed military strategy the Minister referred  to  attempts  to  find
ways of achieving an affordable level of  defence.  Studies  based  on  this
strategy indicated a personnel component of approximately  60 000  full-time
Defence Force members,  including  civilians,  with  related  reductions  in
infrastructure, main equipment and units, the exact  number  and  geographic
distribution of which is currently under investigation.

Indications  are  that  the  Defence  Force  design  and   structure   under
investigation,  which  includes  the  Strategic  Defence  Package,  will  be
affordable and sustainable, assuming  that  the  Defence  budget  allocation
will remain at its current level of 1,7% of the GDP. This structure will  be
able to execute all the missions and contingencies expected  of  the  SANDF,
although the reduced resource levels will influence the extent to which  the
missions will be executed.

The core force concept depends  on  the  ability  of  the  force  to  expand
quickly should the need  arise.  This  depends  on  the  availability  of  a
viable, transformed and integrated reserve force that  is  multiskilled  and
diversified at all levels. Such a  reserve  force  has  great  potential  to
contribute to the RDP and Nepad.

However, as the hon Thandi Modise has observed, the reserve  force  has  not
been receiving the attention it deserves. In the light of the  defence  pact
concluded in 2001 within SADC and the  likely  requirements  once  political
settlements have been made in a number of sub-Saharan  countries,  immediate
steps will be taken to address this issue. Of importance  is  the  budgetary
constraints. The Minister spoke about  the  difficulty  or  the  problem  of
balancing our budget.

To maintain a 35% strength in the conventional reserves and  an  almost  75%
strength in the  territorial  reserves,  some  R264  million  per  annum  is
required.

This budget should  reside  within  the  directorate  of  reserves,  and  be
activity-based. The amount may  appear  large,  but  it  is  actually  small
compared to the personnel cost of  the  SA  Army  regular  component,  which
exceeds R2,6 billion. The amount excludes operational costs, but allows  for
fair recruitment, training and retention of the  reserves  as  well  as  the
integration of ex-MK and ex-Apla members who want to serve  in  the  reserve
force.

While the core function of the department is to defend  the  nation  against
external aggression, the Department of Defence understands  that  it  has  a
role in reconstruction and development. Collateral utility  means  peacetime
utilisation  of  defence  resources  for  development.   It   embodies   the
contribution of the Department  of  Defence  to  internal  security,  peace,
stability and development.

I was impressed to learn that our general support  base  in  Oudtshoorn  has
developed  a  good  partnership  with  the  community  in   a   project   of
distributing books to disadvantaged  schools.  This  demonstrates  that  the
general support base has  heard  the  President's  call  to  the  nation  to
volunteer in the spirit of Letsema and Vukuzenzele.  This  also  shows  that
this general support  base  understands  its  peacetime  mission  to  be  of
service to our citizens.

The core force concept requires that we recruit and train young  people  who
will be disciplined, fit and ready to defend the nation.  It  requires  that
our department selects and keeps the best cadres to fulfil the  requirements
for achieving a professional and well-trained SA National Defence Force.

During 2000, we  commenced  a  process  to  develop  a  new  human  resource
strategy aimed at ensuring  the  availability  of  the  right  quantity  and
quality. The new military skills development service aimed  at  rejuvenating
the SANDF and implementing the Skills Development Act is part  of  this  new
human resource strategy.

This new integrated employment strategy takes into account issues  of  equal
opportunities and affirmative action. It is critical that we hold  our  line
managers, unit commanders and service  chiefs  accountable  for  integrating
employment equity as part of the work on which  their  performance  will  be
assessed.

The  practice  of  relegating  employment  equity  to  human   resource   or
transformation departments and advisory boards is strategically unsound,  as
these  structures  can  do  no  more  than  provide  line  management   with
professional advice, which the latter may choose to ignore.

To ensure the optimal health of  our  members,  the  Department  of  Defence
programme on combating the spread of HIV/Aids and caring for those  who  are
affected is premised on the fundamental principle that HIV/Aids  is  one  of
many chronic, progressive and  potentially  life-threatening  diseases.  The
launch of the Masibambisane Campaign, focusing on  behavioural  change,  and
targeting specifically military personnel, has added impetus  to  the  fight
against HIV/Aids.

Our department has been actively involved in  developing  partnerships  with
other state departments and the  private  sector  to  develop  an  effective
demobilisation programme to ensure that those who are leaving the SANDF  are
properly equipped for civilian employment. Work sessions were held with  the
support of the US Department of Defence and the Department of Labour.  These
were the life skills development programme, held  in  March  2001,  and  the
South African-US rationalisation workshop which took  place  from  9  to  13
July in Pretoria. Indeed, the department  is  looking  at  integrating  this
kind of training into daily training.

The purpose of these workshops was to establish intersectoral  collaboration
with relevant state  departments,  and  to  ensure  that  we  do  not  throw
unemployed soldiers out into the street,  but  help  them  to  become  self-
supporting and economically active after they leave the SANDF.

The Military Veterans Advisory Board has made  good  progress,  and  is  now
involved in preparations  for  the  launch  of  the  new  military  veterans
federation and hosting the World Veterans Federation  Congress  in  December
2003. The military veterans and the Department of Defence  are  involved  in
the Freedom  Park  initiative  which  will  commemorate  and  celebrate  the
history of our struggle for freedom.

We recognise that the present working conditions of soldiers, especially  in
the lower ranks, are far from satisfactory and we  continue  to  search  for
ways to improve them. These conditions, which were designed in the  previous
dispensation for a conscripted army, are not congruent with the notion of  a
voluntary and professional national defence force.

General Nyanda has begun to explore  a  more  appropriate  package  for  our
soldiers who have continued  to  serve  with  dedication  despite  the  poor
working conditions and the heavy challenge of the job of  being  a  soldier.
The general has also  issued  an  instruction  to  all  the  service  chiefs
demanding that  they  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  transformation  by
backing their commitment with clear programmes and targets  for  accelerated
training  and  fast-tracking  the  promotion  of   those   who   have   been
historically disadvantaged.
We have realised that the situation in the  South  African  Military  Health
Service needs to  be  corrected.  While  the  membership  of  the  SAMHS  is
predominantly female, its top leadership remains white and male. I hope  the
Sergeant-General, who is present here, will take up the challenge,  when  he
fills the vacant post in SAMHS, to target specifically blacks and  women  as
a corrective measure that is long overdue.

Gender transformation remains a daunting task in the Department of  Defence.
It  entails  transforming  the  predominantly  male  culture,  and  adopting
special measures to address the  obstacles  and  challenges  women  soldiers
face. Despite these immense challenges, we have begun to see the results  of
the  Department  of  Defence  gender  policies,  spearheaded  by  the  Equal
Opportunities Directorate. These include  policies  on  equal  opportunities
and affirmative action, sexual harassment and fast-tracking and  mentorship.
I am proud that some of these women are here today. I appeal to  all  senior
officers to actively support the work of the directorate.
The launch in August 2000 of the African Women's Peace Table  was  acclaimed
as  a  ground-breaking  initiative.  The  Department  of  Defence  hosted  a
conference bringing together, for the first time, women  and  men  from  the
department with women and men from civil society to chart the way for  peace
in Africa. The African Women's Peace Table must be strengthened.

South Africa continues to spearhead the campaign  to  rid  our  country  and
those of our region and continent of  surplus  and  illegal  arms.  We  have
dismantled our  military  nuclear  capability  and  converted  it  for  non-
military use. We campaigned for the banning  of  anti-personnel  mines,  and
our country was amongst the first to sign the treaty banning mines, and  has
begun drafting enabling legislation as required by the convention.

The Freedom Charter is as alive today as it was  in  1955.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter,  ek  wil  begin  deur  vir  die  agb
Minister te sê ek wil hom enersyds komplimenteer en andersyds kritiseer.  Ek
wil die agb Minister gelukwens  met  sy  uitspraak  oor  Zimbabwe.  Ek  moet
eerlik vir u sê dit is die eerste keer  dat  ek  hoor  'n  Minister  het  'n
persoonlike standpunt oor 'n internasionale saak van sy  regering.  Maar  hy
het ten minste die waarheid gepraat deur te sê dat die stille diplomasie  'n
mislukking was sover dit Zimbabwe betref. Daarmee wil ek hom gelukwens.

As ons by verdediging kom, wil ek eerstens die Minister daarop wys  dat  dit
opgeteken is dat hy gesê het as daar lede van die Weermag  is  wat  probleme
het, moet daar onmiddellik aandag gegee word aan  daardie  probleme,  anders
raak hulle gefrustreerd en nou-nou doen hulle dinge wat hulle nie moet  doen
nie.

Ek wil vandag hier op rekord plaas dat ek al sedert 1997 in  korrespondensie
is met die kantoor van die Ministerie oor  'n  voormalige  lid  wat  nie  sy
pensioen kry nie. Ek  het  die  agb  Minister  verlede  jaar  persoonlik  in
Pretoria gaan sien en al wat ek op hierdie oomblik  kry,  is  erkenning  van
ontvangs van skrywe. Ek wil by die  agb  Minister  weet  of  hy  ernstig  is
wanneer hy sê dat as lede  probleme  het,  daaraan  onmiddellik  aandag  aan
gegee moet word, want hierdie saak sloer nou al vir vyf jaar.

Die agb Minister het vandag hier gesê dat 376 miljoen dollar  se  teenhandel
reeds verkry is uit die wapenpakket. Ek is bly om dit te hoor, want dit  was
deel van die voorwaardes. Die tenderaars was onderworpe  daaraan  dat  hulle
100% teenhandel met Suid-Afrika moes lewer. Maar ek  wil  ook  van  die  agb
Minister weet hoeveel werkgeleenthede geskep is met hierdie US $376  miljoen
wat reeds in Suid-Afrika beland het. Ons kan  nie  die  wapenpakket  en  die
hele aangeleentheid daaromheen maar net onder die mat vee en maak  asof  dit
nie meer bestaan nie.

In daardie wapensverslag word dit baie duidelik gestel dat,  sover  dit  die
Fet-program betref, nie een van die tenderaars voldoen het aan  die  minimum
evalueringskriteria in terme  van  finansies,  die  Weermag  se  teenhandel,
industriële deelname in Suid-Afrika óf die tegniese vereistes  nie.  Nie  'n
enkele een nie! As ons kyk na die tegniese vereistes, wat sê  dit  vir  ons?
Het ons nou 'n minderwaardige program of  produk  wat  ons  hier  vir  Suid-
Afrika se Vloot kom lewer? Hoe  lank  het  die  Vloot  nie  gewag  vir  nuwe
produkte nie? Dit is vrae wat die publiek  daarbuite  ook  vra  en  die  agb
Minister moet ook daarop antwoord.

'n Lid van hierdie Huis, 'n voormalige ANC-hoofsweep, is nou  op  verlof  om
hom voor te berei vir sy hofsaak, maar hy kry elke  maand  sy  salaris.  Die
Hoof van die Weermag is ook bevoordeel met die aankoop van 'n motor.  Hoekom
is hy nie ook op verlof om hom te gaan voorberei vir 'n hofsaak nie?  Of  is
dit 'n geval van omdat hy die Hoof van die Weermag is, sal  ons  dit  op  'n
ander manier hanteer? Dubbele standaarde! Vir die VF is dit nie  aanvaarbaar
nie. Wat goed is vir die een, is goed vir die ander.

Die agb Minister praat toe ook oor die SAOG-lande  en  die  vredesinisiatief
in Afrika. Almal is ten gunste van vrede in Afrika en dit  is  goed  as  die
Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Weermag ook sy deel bydra. Maar die vraag wat  die
VF  vra  is:  wie  gaan  op  die  ou  end  daarvoor  betaal?  Is   dit   die
belastingbetalers van Suid-Afrika wat moet betaal? Ons sit met die  probleem
van die Weermag in Burundi en die  Demokratiese  Republiek  van  Kongo.  Wie
gaan op die ou end  daarvoor  betaal?  Die  agb  Minister  moet  daarop  ook
antwoord. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, I would like to  start  by  telling  the
hon the Minister that  I  want  to  compliment  him  on  the  one  hand  and
criticise him on the other. I want to congratulate the hon the  Minister  on
his statement on Zimbabwe. I must honestly say that this is the  first  time
I hear a minister with  a  personal  viewpoint  regarding  an  international
issue of his government. But at least he spoke  the  truth  by  saying  that
quiet diplomacy had been a failure as far as Zimbabwe was concerned. I  want
to congratulate him on that.

Getting to defence, I first want to point out to the Minister that he is  on
record as having said that if there are members of  the  Defence  Force  who
are experiencing problems, these problems should be dealt with  immediately,
otherwise they will get frustrated and just now they  will  do  things  they
should not be doing.

I want to place on record here today that I  have  been  corresponding  with
the office of the Ministry since 1997 about  a  former  member  who  is  not
receiving his pension. Last year I went to see the  Minister  personally  in
Pretoria and the only thing I have at the moment is  an  acknowledgement  of
receipt of correspondence. I want to ask the hon the Minister whether he  is
serious when he says  that  if  members  are  experiencing  problems,  these
should be dealt with immediately, because this matter has been  dragging  on
for five years.

The hon the Minister has told us here today that 376 million dollars'  worth
of countertrade has already been obtained from the arms package. I  am  glad
to hear this, because that was part of the conditions.  The  tenderers  were
subject to delivery of 100% countertrade with South Africa. But I also  want
to know from the hon the Minister how  many  employment  opportunities  have
been created with the US $376 million  that  has  already  landed  in  South
Africa. We cannot just sweep the arms package and the whole issue around  it
under the carpet and act as if it no longer exists.

That arms report clearly states  that,  as  far  as  the  Fet  programme  is
concerned, not one of the tenderers has met the minimum evaluation  criteria
in  terms  of  finance,  the  Defence   Force's   countertrade,   industrial
participation in South Africa or the technical prerequisites. Not  a  single
one! When we consider the technical prerequisites, what does this  tell  us?
Do we now have an inferior programme or product here that we  are  going  to
be delivering to the South African Navy? How long  has  the  Navy  not  been
waiting for new products? These are questions which the public out there  is
also asking and the Minister has to answer them too.

A member of this House, a former ANC Chief Whip, is currently  on  leave  in
order to prepare himself for his court case, but  every  month  he  receives
his  salary.  The  Chief  of  the  Defence  Force  was  also  favoured  when
purchasing a motor vehicle. Why is he not also on leave to  prepare  himself
for a court case? Or is it that, because he is  the  Chief  of  the  Defence
Force, we will deal with this in a different way? Double standards! This  is
not acceptable to the FF. What is sauce for the  goose,  is  sauce  for  the
gander.

The hon the Minister then also referred to the SADC countries and the  peace
initiative in Africa. Everyone is for peace in Africa and it  is  right  for
the South African National Defence Force to  play  its  part.  However,  the
question being asked by the FF is: Who is going to pay for it at the end  of
the day? Is it the South  African  taxpayer  who  must  pay?  We  have  this
problem of the Defence Force in Burundi and the Democratic Republic  of  the
Congo. Who is going to pay for that at the end  of  the  day?  The  hon  the
Minister must please answer that too.]

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Mr  Chairperson,  hon  members  ...  andazi  nokuba  size
kuxoxa iindaba eziphambi kwenkundla na okanye size kwenza igalelo kwingxoxo-
mpikiswano ngokhuseleko kusini na.  Andazi  ukuba  kutheni  na  singalindeli
inkundla iqhube ngomcimbi wayo, sandule ke ngoku sithethe. [I  do  not  know
whether we have come here to discuss a trial that is in  court  or  we  have
come to debate security. I do not know why we should not let the court  take
its course, and have a discussion afterwards.]

Since the advent of our new democratic Government in 1994, the  SA  National
Defence Force has been transformed from a defence force  that  was  used  to
kill little children in Soweto, Gugulethu and Langa, from  a  defence  force
that attacked  innocent  citizens,  including  women  and  children  in  our
neighbouring states, into a Defence  Force  that  defends  and  protect  its
citizens,  that  spearheads   peacekeeping   and   peace-building   in   its
neighbouring states and assists men, women and children  during  floods  and
other disasters.

Since 1994, the SANDF has been transformed from  a  predominantly  male  and
white force, into an inclusive force  that  deploys  women  to  the  highest
ranks. Presently, we have two generals and a number of  brigadiers  who  are
women in the Defence Force. The SANDF has to be  commended  in  this  regard
since we have 20,1% representation of women throughout  the  Defence  Force,
which is far better than other countries, including the United  Kingdom  and
the United States of America.

Kambe ke, mhlalingaphambili, akukoneli. Kusafuneka  songezile.  Xa  ndijonga
ngaphaya ngasekhohlo kum,  ndifumana  oomama  besembalwa  kakhulu,  bebabini
bathathu. Ngoko ke ndithi  masiqinise,  sibheke  phambili  ukumisela  oomama
kulo mkhosi. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Notwithstanding that, chairperson, it is not  enough.  We  should  increase
the numbers. When on my left, I find that women  are  still  very  few;  you
only see one or two of them. I, therefore, say that let us  be  strong,  and
move forward with the deployment of women in this force.]

We also commend the SANDF for setting up the division on affirmative  action
and equal opportunities. We congratulate the division  on  its  efforts  and
interventions. Sifuna abanye abongezelelekileyo. [We  want  the  numbers  to
increase.]

We are saying well done  to  Sis  Jackie!  We  urge  the  Defence  Force  to
continue with their good work and to do more.

We also commend the Defence Force for opening up opportunities for women  in
all arms of service, since historically women were only deployed in the  so-
called soft jobs such as signals, medical and administrative work.

In 1996, women in the SANDF initiated a helpline to  help  those  women  who
are abused by their partners. We would like  to  commend  this  project  and
trust that other departments and sectors  will  initiate  such  projects  so
that women can be protected from battering by their own partners.

The Defence Force has a strategic role to play in bringing about  peace  and
stability in our country and in the continent. However, in scrutinising  our
budget for the 2002-2003 financial year, I could not find a  dedicated  item
for force preparation and peacekeeping. I trust that this  is  provided  for
somewhere.

I further recommend that a huge number of  those  who  will  be  trained  in
peacekeeping would be women since, I believe, women have an  important  role
to play in peacekeeping and peace-building. In most  countries  where  women
were excluded from peace processes, lasting peace was not attained.

It is also important, politically, to involve women in conflict  resolutions
and peace processes. We all know that women and  children  are  the  biggest
victims of war and conflict. We trust that in the Inter-Congolese  Dialogue,
women's concerns and gender will be placed on the  agenda.  We  cannot  have
lasting peace in  our  region  and  continent  if  more  than  half  of  our
population is excluded. Without women, Africa cannot be  united,  and  Nepad
cannot be fully realised.

We salute Mrs Zanele Mbeki for her role in recognising and  celebrating  the
National Women's Day with women in uniform on 9 August last  year.  We  also
commend her, together  with  the  multiparty  women's  caucus  and  the  ANC
Women's League and other women's  formations  for  meeting  women  from  the
Congo in the  Inter-Congolese  Dialogue  and  for  encouraging  them  to  be
steadfast in finding a non-military settlement in the DRC.

Challenges that still need to be addressed  within  the  SANDF  include  the
following: Equal rights for women in the SANDF; we as men need to  put  into
action equal  access  for  women  to  housing  and  medical  aid  for  their
children. This is policy. But it needs to be put into action  since  it  has
already been accepted as policy. We need to address the  lack  of  women  in
the navy and the Air Force.

These are challenges that we must all address because of the legacy  of  our
education system.

I  ``Bantu  Education''  yasilimaza  iminyaka  engama-50  eyadlulayo.  Iseza
kusilimaza  elinye  ithuba  eliyiminyaka  engama-50  ukuba  asisukumi  ngoku
sibhinqe omfutshane.
Apha  kumkhosi  wolwandle  nowomoya   sifuna   abantwana   abenze   izifundo
zeMathematika, inzululwazi neBiology. Siyazi  ukuba  zinqabile  ezi  zifundo
kwezethu  izikolo.  Ngoko  ke,  kubalulekile   ukuba   thina,   singabazali,
sikhuthaze ulutsha,  ngakumbi  amantombazana  ukuba  bafunde  ezenzululwazi,
ngakumbi  imathematika  nezenzululwazi.  (Translation  of  Xhosa  paragraphs
follows.)

[``Bantu Education'' destroyed us for the past 50 years. We are still  going
to witness its disadvantages for another 50  years  if  we  do  not  make  a
positive move.

In the South African Navy and Air Force, we want young people who have  done
mathematics, Science and Biology. It is a known  fact  that  these  subjects
are rarely found in our schools. Therefore, it  is  important  that  we,  as
parents, encourage the youth, especially girls, to study  the  sciences  and
mathematics.]

There is a whole world of opportunities open for them in the Defence  Force,
especially in the navy and the air force.

Ngoko ke, mhlalingaphambili,  masithundeze  oonyana  neentombi  zethu  ukuba
bangene  emkhosini,  baze  kuba  ziipayilothi,   iincutshe   kwezaselwandle,
kwezekhompyutha, ezenzululwazi,  kwezo  bugqirha  njalo  njalo.  [We  should
then, Chairperson, encourage our sons and daughters  to  join  the  army  so
that  they  could  become  pilots,  experts  in  the  navy,  in  information
technology, the sciences and medical related fields.]

Lastly, I would like to  commend  Armscor  and  Denel,  who  have  initiated
projects to upgrade mathematics and science for black  children.  Denel  has
targeted the weakest schools from the previously disadvantaged  communities,
and  has  provided  them  with  teaching  and  learning  aids,  as  well  as
resources, including food, for needy children. Armscor sponsors and  mentors
dropouts  from  previously  disadvantaged  communities  in  mathematics  and
science and provides jobs for them after completing their studies.  We  call
on various companies to  follow  their  illustrious  examples,  and  promote
mathematics and science among the previously disadvantaged  communities  for
economic development, job creation and poverty alleviation.

Okokugqibela,  ndithi,  masiphakame   singabazali,   silulutsha   sikwangabo
nabahlali, sibe nebhongo, sibe neqhayiya, sizingce ngomkhosi  wethu.  Mazise
abantu  okokuba   namhlanje   lo   mkhosi   wokhuselo   waseMzantsi   Afrika
awungomkhosi  wokubulala  abantu,  ngumkhosi  wokwakha   isizwe,   ngumkhosi
wokwakha uluntu ngokubanzi. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of  Xhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[Lastly, I  say  that  let  us  stand  up  as  parents,  as  the  youth  and
communities and be proud of our army. Let us  tell  people  that  the  South
African National Defence Force is not an army that is meant to kill  people,
but that it is an army that is going to build the nation. It is an  army  of
the people. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member. I  believe  the
hon member was very good at mathematics and physical science at  school  and
university.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, hon  Minister,  the  defence  of  a  country  is
determined by its specific context and is dynamic  in  nature.  Whereas  the
central aim and focus is defence of the country, Government and its  people,
the third objective stated in the strategic plan  appeals  to  me  most.  It
states that the key objective of the Department of Defence is and I quote:


  To provide support  for  the  population  or  government  departments  in
  operations other than war.

These objectives, in  peacetime,  should  loom  large  and  occupy  a  prime
position in our thinking and planning. Development  of  this  country  is  a
form of defence. When South Africans are gainfully  employed  and  can  have
food on their tables or bread in their bags, the prospect of  peace  becomes
more realisable. We, as a country, are well known  for  peace  and  not  for
war.  Our  major  export  to  Africa  is  peace,  conflict  resolution   and
mediation.

The other area of involvement by the  Defence  Force  is  in  prevention  of
crime and economic destabilisation. Our SANDF has the  necessary  muscle  to
help in safety and security. This country, which is  the  nearest  place  on
earth close to paradise, should be assisted to contain crime and enabled  to
develop to its full potential.

The debate on  the  strategic  arms  procurement  programme  continues.  The
acquirement of four naval corvettes,  three  submarines,  30  light  utility
helicopters, 24 trainer aircraft and 28 fighter aircraft at an initial  cost
of about R30 billion and increasing to about  R50  billion  in  the  12-year
period, is a millstone around  our  necks.  This  is  water  which  is  fast
flowing understream. We  now  want  to  see  justification  for  this  major
expenditure. For this new equipment to lie  in  the  army  stores  until  it
becomes obsolete would be a double tragedy. High involvement by the army  in
development might be the only way in which the blow can be softened.

The reported case of the release of MK prisoners  with  a  handful  of  Apla
forces is in line with the repeated calls made by us  over  the  years.  Our
only main concern is those who have been left languishing in prison  and  we
demand their immediate release.  Apartheid  was  declared  a  crime  against
humanity. Those who were involved in fighting apartheid  cannot  justifiably
be punished by a new democratic government. We need to have  a  clean  slate
which separates the different eras.

Just this past weekend, I joined a group  of  ex-Robben  Islanders  and  ex-
stone  quarry  graduates  and  we  revived  memories  of  inhuman  suffering
inflicted on us during those dark  days.  It  is  inconsiderable  that  many
people are  still  in  prison  today.  Let  me  remark  pointedly  that  the
government of the USA, which regards ex-fighters of apartheid as  criminals,
is guilty of a grotesque and unforgivable sin. [Time expired.]

Mr  R  JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson,  Minister  and  hon  members,  these   are
challenging  times  for  South  Africa.  Faced  with  growing  unemployment,
poverty and an HIV/Aids crisis, we still have to maintain a  viable  Defence
Force. In the budget, a balance has to be maintained between expenditure  on
personnel, acquisitions and training in order to  maintain  the  operational
readiness of the force.

While the balance within the department is important,  the  prioritising  of
our spending in order to improve the  quality  of  lives  of  average  South
Africans is more important. The most prominent issue that  dominated  public
debate around defence  spending  over  the  past  two  years  has  been  the
acquisition of the strategic defence  packages.  These  packages  have  been
controversial  since  they  were  announced,  for  the  following   reasons.
Firstly, from the outset, allegations of corruption and irregularities  were
part of the process. Secondly, a review of the Defence Review  is  imminent.
The whole acquisition process was based on a Defence Review  that  does  not
take into account the changing role of the SANDF, in terms of  international
obligations, and therefore does not meet the future needs of the  SANDF.  In
fact, I doubt, in the end, whether the SANDF has the capacity  or  resources
to utilise the new equipment optimally since it is struggling to do so  with
its current equipment.

Thirdly, and most importantly, is the fluctuation of the  final  price.  The
DA will not  support  an  acquisition  process  with  no  fixed  price  tag.
[Interjections.] Repeated calls to the  Government  to  cut  its  losses  by
cancelling the second and third tranches of the  so-called  arms  deal  have
fallen on deaf ears. [Interjections.] This could have saved the country  R18
billion, which could rather have been used for one of the following: over  1
million houses to assist with the approximately 7 million  unit  backlog;  a
basic support grant for 2 million children at current  levels  of  R130  per
month for six years; it could pay the  salaries  of  almost  50  000  police
constables for the next 10 years; it could have  put  one  million  children
through school for the next six years; or it could have funded the  national
budget allocation for textbooks and stationery supplies  at  current  levels
for the next 20 years.

We, as public representatives, have to take responsibility for our  actions.
In rural South Africa, such as Qwaqwa,  food  insecurity  is  75%.  Spending
over R52 billion on arms when faced with  pressing  socioeconomic  needs  is
almost criminal. The DA will not be party to that.

In closing, we would like to thank the members of the department  who  brief
us on our activities and assist us  with  our  work  as  legislators.  Their
assistance is greatly appreciated. [Applause.]

Mr R J B MOHLALA: Mohlomphegi Moswaramarapo, Tona, ba mphato bao  re  šomago

  Kgabela Mokone morw'a Matsabatse, kgabela motho ka  selepe,  go  hlwa  go

Ka fao, ke tlile  go  tlogela  tshele,  ra  tšwela  pele  ra  rutana  nnete.
(Translation of Pedi paragraph follows.)

[Mr R J B MOHLALA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, my  father
once advised me as follows:


  Take an axe, Mokone, son of Matsabatse, and chop up somebody because  too
  much talk leads to more complaints and complaints do not build a home.

Therefore, I am going to stop complaining so that we may go ahead and  teach
one another the truth.]

The imperatives of today's debate are  that,  as  a  responsible  Government
that has been elected by the majority  of  the  people,  we  owe  those  who
elected us some answers to the questions that are always flighted before  us
by the opposition. They and they only are entitled to answers.  We  need  to
pose questions such as: Why is South Africa spending money on the  strategic
defence packages where there is no imminent and  immediate  external  threat
and aggression? What is the Government buying? Does  the  equipment  satisfy
defence needs? Do these packages have to cost  what  we  are  paying?  Could
they not have been cheaper?

Those are the questions but before we answer them, we need  to  accept  that
the money that has been spent is a lot of  money.  Billions  are  a  lot  of
money. It is important that we should spend those billions so  that  we  are
in  position  to  defend  not  only  our  country  but  even  those  of  our
neighbours.

The decision taken to procure these arms was taken after  a  very  elaborate
exercise that included the involvement of communities and,  of  course,  all
the political parties - unless if people want to  say  to  us  that  if  one
parliament takes a decision, that  decision  is  not  binding  on  the  next
parliament. After a thorough consultation with all  stakeholders  and  role-
players, this very Parliament then took a decision  to  go  ahead  with  the
procurement.

The decision was guided by  the  intention  to  develop  long-term  strategy
alliance with South Africa's major trading partners. Therefore, there is  no
question of whether they could have  been  bought  somewhere  at  a  cheaper
price, hence we talk of a strategic package.

The packages have in them the component of offsets.  But  this  is  not  the
primary issue. The primary issue is defence.  It  is  a  component  that  is
practised by almost  all  developed  countries  such  as  Finland,  Denmark,
Norway, Netherlands, etc. In actual fact, other  countries  such  as  Canada
and Australia require offsets for any government purchase from  abroad,  not
only arms. I guess what we are saying here is that there is no way  that  we
as a country, can be discredited by this deal. It was done to develop  long-
term alliances with internationally  successful  defence  equipment  groups,
not only for the South African defence industry,  but  also  for  the  whole
international global economic market.

We are always told how we do not need to purchase arms when the  country  is
not facing imminent and immediate danger. But how do we know when  we  would
be facing imminent danger? Are  we  prophets?  Do  we  still  have  credible
prophets? If we do, I will listen to them and not listen to the  wishy-washy
fallacies that we got here today.

In the first instance, it takes a long time to  rebuild  armed  forces  once
they have been allowed to run down. The most cost-effective way to  maintain
defence capability is to maintain a steady  rate  of  equipment  acquisition
and replacement, not the boom-bust  of  the  previous  years.  As  a  result
thereof, the defence force was more equipped in the past to  concentrate  on
land watch, because of the battle called swartgevaar. And  that  time  past.
They had rifles, tanks,  trucks,  etc.  But  if  we  look  at  the  type  of
submarines that are available to us today, some of them are as old as 30  if
not 50 years, and this is really unacceptable. We should  not  forget  that,
among other things, this country used to be isolated  by  the  international
community and as such there were sanctions against it. Even if  they  wanted
to buy arms, no one was prepared to sell to them.

This Government brought with it pride to  the  people  of  South  Africa  by
gaining the confidence of the international community. By the  way,  no  one
will sell arms to anyone if they think that  person  is  irresponsible.  The
fact that there are people who are prepared to sell arms to  us  means  that
people  realise  that  we  are  a  responsible  government,  and   that   is
imperative.

It should also be remembered that quite  recently,  we  had  two  full-scale
civil wars within  our  neighbouring  countries,  but  fortunately,  as  the
Minister has already indicated, there is a bit of stability  in  Angola  and
the DRC. If we did not have the muscle to defend our  neighbours,  would  we
be in Burundi and the DRC? No, we would be sitting here not knowing what  to
do. The people who are against this are actually saying to  us  that  we  do
not need an army that is combat ready. I do  not  think  that  South  Africa
wants to be in that position.

There are other threats in that there is a growing paramilitary  problem  in
Africa, cross-border banditry and coastal piracy, all of  which  affect  the
region's ability  to  develop  its  economies  and  to  attract  the  needed
investment.

South Africa does not exist as an island. It is part of a  global  community
and as such it must be able to assist friends affected  by  those  problems.
It should also be able to take part in the peace support operations like  it
is doing in the DRC to satisfy its peacekeeping obligations.

Allow me to indicate something. In one of our visits to  the  reservists  in
the Eastern Cape, we were ferried from a  helicopter  in  a  bus  which  had
clocked 750 000 kilometres on its odometer. One can imagine  how  long  that
thing had been travelling. Other things include the  question  of  uniforms,
etc. What I am saying is that we should always remember that though  we  are
now talking about this package, it might not be  our  last  one.  There  are
other gaps that need to be filled, like airlifts and maritime.  We  need  to
fill those gaps if we want to remain a responsible Government.

They say we must cancel the second and the  third  purchases,  arguing  that
the money saved as a result of the interest would be  enough  to  finance  a
million income grants. But what they fail to tell us is that  there  are  13
million people who need income grants. So if we  save  money  to  finance  1
million people who is going to finance the other 12  million?  That  is  the
question that needs to be answered.

Allow me, by way of conclusion, to  say  that  the  equipment  that  we  are
buying is not as costly as they would like us to believe.  I  will  give  an
example. We are paying a market-related  price.  Four  corvettes  will  cost
South Africa less than India has recently paid for a single  Godavari  class
frigate. We are paying less per ship than the small  Lekiui  class  recently
acquired by Malaysia. The Gripen  will  cost  substantially  less  than  the
United Arab Emirates is paying for F-16s and the hawks will cost  less  than
Canada paid for its hawks.

[After this submission, we need to know that we have to arm  ourselves.  You
must not scratch a tiger's back and then, when it attacks you and  tries  to
scratch you, be surprised, because you are not armed. In other  words,  what
I am saying is, one should not dance in the mud and  expect  dust  to  ensue
from it. [Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the safety of  our  country  rests  in  this
department.  The  MF  is,  however,  confident  in  the  operation  of   the
department and is impressed by its hard work, dedication and determination.

It should be taken into consideration that the department's  role  does  not
stop at providing defence, as its title  suggests.  It  also  exists  as  an
instrument  for  building  better  external  relations  in   many   of   our
neighbouring countries.

The MF is reassured by the  department's  aims,  which  are  to  defend  and
protect South Africa, its territorial activity and its people in  accordance
with our Constitution and international law, which regulates the use of  the
force.  This  clearly  exhibits  the  department's  zest,   nationally   and
internationally, as a domestic and a global force.

The Department  of  Defence  has  numerous  contributions  to  make  to  the
development  of  society.  It   knowledgeably   inculcates   a   recruitment
programme. Noting the escalating unemployment  rate,  this  would  certainly
assist in reducing it. The outrageous crime rate  may  also  be  reduced  by
recruiting persons into this disciplined field.

The MF salutes the faceless persons that serve in this department, who  make
sacrifices in their dedication  to  serve  this  nation  with  their  lives.
Programmes to be instituted by the department appear well  revised  and  are
important in providing proper defence to the nation.

The MF supports the programmes and finds the allocated budget sufficient  to
do so. The building of  better  relations  globally  is  important  and  the
importance of defence to our people  is  as  important  as  defence  to  all
humanity. Globally, we witness the killing  of  so  many  innocent  victims.
Some of it is inflicted by governments on their own  people.  We  have  been
there too.

Today, we shed tears at the hard past, but we smile at  knowing  today  that
we are safe as we stand here. Our people's Government serves to protect  and
our Department of Defence strives to protect it.

In salute to the hon the Minister and his department, the MF  supports  this
Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP:  Mev  die  Speaker,  vergun  my  om  van  hierdie  geleentheid
misbruik  te  maak  om  die  Minister  geluk  te  wens  met  sy  eerlike  en
belangwekkende erkenning, naamlik dat die beleid van die SA  Regering  jeens
mnr Mugabe van Zimbabwe misluk het. Die belang van so 'n  erkenning  is  dat
dit die weg moet baan vir veranderde optrede, en die  AEB  wag  in  spanning
daarop,  meer  spesifiek  met   betrekking   tot   die   begrotingspos   van
verdediging.

Die sleutel tot 'n suksesvolle Weermag is die  dissipline  van  sy  soldate.
Studies het duidelik getoon dat dissipline nie net van  buite  af  afgedwing
kan word nie, maar afhanklik is van lojaliteit. Lojaliteit  in  die  Weermag
is op sy beurt afhanklik van 'n gelukkige soldatekorps. In  dié  verband  is
dit verontrustend dat die grootste vakunie in die Weermag, die SA  Nasionale
Weermag-unie, wat met sy 21 000 lede 'n derde van alle  soldate,  asook  die
volle sosiale en kulturele spektrum, van  die  soldatekorps  verteenwoordig,
ernstige probleme in die Weermag  ondervind,  en  dat  hulle  blykbaar  voor
geslote deure te staan kom wanneer hulle hierdie probleme  op  wettige  wyse
onder die aandag van die  Minister  wil  bring.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, allow me to take advantage of this  opportunity
to congratulate the Minister with  his  honest  and  interesting  admission,
namely that the policy of the South African Government towards Mr Mugabe  of
Zimbabwe has failed. The importance of such an admission is that  it  should
pave the way for transformative action, and the  AEB  is  waiting  anxiously
for this, more specifically with regards to the Budget Vote on Defence.

The key to a successful Defence Force is the  discipline  of  its  soldiers.
Studies have clearly shown that discipline cannot only be forced  down  from
the outside, but is dependent upon loyalty. Loyalty in the Defence Force  is
in turn  dependent  on  a  happy  soldiers  corps.  In  this  regard  it  is
disturbing that the biggest  trade  union  in  the  Defence  Force,  the  SA
National Defence Union, with its 21 000 members, which  represents  a  third
of all soldiers, as well as the entire social and cultural spectrum  of  the
soldiers corps, is experiencing serious problems in the Defence  Force,  and
that they apparently come up against closed doors when they  try  and  bring
these problems under the Minister's attention in a legal manner.]

Earlier this year, the union had to declare that -


  ...  a  constant  deterioration  in  all  fields  of  labour   relations,
  characterises the SANDF.

This consequently led to a memorandum saying ``enough is enough''.

A few of the problems stated in the memorandum  are  undue  interference  in
the professional responsibilities  of  the  Chief  of  the  SANDF;  lack  of
compensation  for  overtime  work;  lack  of  transparency   regarding   the
restructuring of the Defence Force, resulting in personnel  not  being  able
to plan their military career; the plan to retrench all members  older  than
30 years who have not yet achieved the rank of corporal  while  there  is  a
bottleneck due to a lack of promotion courses; the limitation  of  maternity
leave to two confinements only; and the abnormally high  ratio  of  generals
per capita - one general for every 250 soldiers, while  the  salary  of  one
general  absorbs  that  of  13  troops.  Furthermore,  they   have   serious
grievances about staff placement policy,  remunerative  aspects,  promotions
and performance awards.

Dit is nie vir die AEB, of selfs  hierdie  Huis,  om  kant  te  kies  in  'n
arbeidsgeskil nie. Wat egter verontrustend is, is dat die  kanale  waarlangs
die soldate van Suid-Afrika  vir  hulle  regte  kan  beding  in  werklikheid
toegestop blyk te wees. My inligting is dat die Minister  opdrag  gegee  het
dat die werkgewers  se  verteenwoordigers  op  die  Militêre  Bedingingsraad
vanaf  September   2001   moet   onttrek   van   onderhandelings   met   die
georganiseerde werknemers.  (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is not the task of the AEB, or even this House, to take  sides  in  this
labour dispute. What is, however, disquieting is that the  channels  through
which the soldiers of South Africa can negotiate for their rights  seems  to
have been blocked in reality. My information is that the Minister  gave  the
instruction that the workers' representatives  on  the  Military  Bargaining
Council should withdraw from  negotiations  with  organised  employers  with
effect from September 2001.]

Furthermore, the Military Arbitration Board has not yet convened, whilst  it
should have been in place since August 1999.

Daar mag verskeie redes wees vir  hierdie  dooie  punte  en  doodloopstrate.
Blaam  kan  oor  en  weer  geslinger  word.  Feit  is,  dit  is  'n   uiters
onbevredigende situasie. Die AEB versoek  die  volgende:  dat  die  menslike
hulpbronne departement van die weermag dringend  hersien  en  herstruktureer
moet word om effektief te funksioneer, dat die  grondwetlike  vereistes  van
deursigtigheid en administratiewe geregtigheid altyd nagekom word,  dat  die
Militêre  Bedingingsraad  sy  werksaamhede  onverwyld  hervat  en  dat   die
Arbitrasie Raad dringend byeen geroep word.

Ek dra vandag hierdie baadjie met trots: ``1 SDB'' - ``One  Special  Service
Battalion''. Die agb Brig Genl Schalkwyk weet wat hierdie drie  proteas  vir
'n lojale pantserman beteken. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die uitdagings vir vandag se Weermag is dalk veel meer gekompliseerd  as  in
my tyd. Daar is die inkorporering van verskillende magte van die verlede  en
die   saamvoeg   van   vroeër   teenoorstaande   lojaliteite   van   dikwels
uiteenlopende kulture. Ons mag nie toelaat  dat  hierdie  uitdagings  bederf
word deur 'n gebrek aan die gewoon basiese vereistes wat noodsaaklik is  vir
'n toegewyde,  lojale  en  gedissiplineerde  soldatekorps  nie.  Dit  is  so
noodsaaklik  vir  die  veiligheid  en  die  integriteit   van   Suid-Afrika.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Gelag.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There might be various reasons for these  stalemates  and  impasses.  Blame
may be flung back and forth. The fact remains  that  this  is  an  extremely
unsatisfactory situation. The AEB requests the  following:  that  the  human
resources department of the  Defence  Force  be  reviewed  and  restructured
immediately in  order  to  function  effectively,  that  the  constitutional
requirements of transparency and administrative justice always  be  complied
with, that the Military Bargaining Council  resume  its  activities  without
delay and that the Arbitration Board be convened urgently.

Today I am wearing this jacket with pride: ``1 SDB'': ``One Special  Service
Battalion''. The hon Brig Gen Schalkwyk knows what these three proteas  mean
to a loyal member of the armoured corps. [Interjections.]

The challenges for  the  Defence  Force  of  today  are  perhaps  much  more
complicated than it was in my time. There is the incorporation of  different
forces of the past and the  joining  of  previously  opposite  loyalties  of
often divergent cultures. We should not allow these challenges to be  spoilt
by a lack of the common,  basic  requirements  which  are  necessary  for  a
dedicated, loyal and disciplined soldiers corps. This is  so  essential  for
the safety and the integrity of South Africa. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]]

Mr D M DLALI: Madam Speaker,  the  most  significant  strategic  development
over the past few years is South Africa's new status in Southern Africa.

Previously an arena of intense conflict, with the election of  a  democratic
Government in April 1994, relations with neighbouring  states  changed  from
suspicion and animosity to friendship and co-operation.

For  politically  strategic  and  geographic  reasons,  the  South   African
Government regards security and defence co-operation in Southern  Africa  as
a priority. We have before us a budget that takes account of the reality  of
Africa today, an Africa plagued by poverty and strife, but an Africa on  the
brink of a rebirth, an Africa preparing itself to take its proper  place  in
the international arena.

Since the end of the Cold War, the region has undergone substantial  change.
Considerable  progress  has  been   made   towards   the   resolution,   the
establishment of democracy  and  disarmament.  The  prospects  for  regional
peace and stability are greater today than  at  any  other  time  in  recent
decades. Much of the subcontinent, and maybe the continent, is  stricken  by
underdevelopment and problems of poverty, illiteracy and unemployment.

Certain states on the subcontinent  and  the  continent  remain  politically
volatile. This needs our co-operation and assistance in order for  Nepad  to
work and the world to take Africa seriously as a continent. This is  why  we
need to  deploy  our  troops,  if  necessary,  within  the  region  and  the
continent as a whole in pursuit of peacekeeping.

These conflicts, if not resolved, impact negatively on  neighbouring  states
in the form of a range of non-military threats. These include the spread  of
disease, large numbers of refugees and displaced  people,  and  cross-border
trafficking in drugs, stolen goods and small arms.

These issues need our  co-operation  as  a  country  and  nobody  should  be
opposed to the  South  African  Government  playing  a  meaningful  role  in
seeking solutions and resolutions. This could include the deployment of  our
troops whenever it is necessary abroad. Our  country  is  committed  to  the
development of a common security approach  in  Southern  Africa.  This  will
entail  the  SADC  states  shaping  their  political  security  and  defence
policies in co-operations with each other.

The Government may be called on by neighbouring states to play a  number  of
supportive roles. The SANDF could provide  assistance  in  many  ways,  like
controlling cross-border trafficking in small arms, training, education  and
upgrading of weaponry and equipment.

The President, in his state of the nation address  this  year  in  February,
said:


  During the course of last year our commitment to Africa's  progress  also
  found expression in the deployment of our sons and daughters  in  uniform
  in Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi. We did so,
  because we remain confident that our sister peoples  in  these  countries
  will find solutions to their problems.
The role that is played by the President in  the  region,  the  subcontinent
and the continent should be supported by the  whole  nation,  including  the
opposition parties, to ensure that there is peace  and  friendship  on  this
continent of ours, Africa, and for Nepad to work and ensure the  success  of
the African Union.

There is a notion or perception which  says:  ``We  need  bread  instead  of
guns.'' I want to deal with this perception  in  the  following  manner.  We
have to defend our revolution. We are not ashamed of  that.  We  fought  for
this  country  with  the  assistance  of  our  comrades  on  the  continent,
particularly the subcontinent countries  like  Angola,  Tanzania,  Zimbabwe,
Lesotho and others. Our comrades died in action. We  have  to  remember  the
fallen comrades of our movement who died in action by not letting them  down
and by defending our revolution.

The deployment of our troops in the DRC and Burundi should be  seen  in  the
context of our international obligation for peace and friendship. All  South
Africans should be behind our brothers and sons, sisters  and  daughters  in
uniform who are representing our country and  keeping  South  Africa's  flag
flying high wherever they are.

We should be proud of our troops. The SANDF must maintain the capability  to
prepare its forces on a continuous basis for the self-defence function,  and
must also maintain effective support capabilities.

The two specific challenges we face  are  to  work  with  the  rest  of  our
continent to ensure the success of the African  Union  and  Nepad,  the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development. Thus the vision  of  African  patriots
will be realised, that of regeneration of Africa and the birth  of  the  new
civilisation.

Peace and friendship among the peoples also require  that  we  work  to  end
Africa's marginalisation in world affairs. This can only happen if we  first
tackle the challenges faced by the African Union and Nepad purposefully  and
successfully. Therefore,  whatever  money  this  Government  spends  on  the
development of our troops on the subcontinent or  continent,  it  should  be
seen in the context of  our  obligation  to  promote  peace,  stability  and
friendship on the continent. There shall be peace and friendship in Africa.

The Department of Defence also raised, in one of  the  outputs  on  defence,
the matter of Defence Force health  capabilities.  We  also  call  upon  the
department to make sure that they combat Aids within the Defence Force,  and
also embark on a programme set by the Government in terms  of  points  A,  B
and C. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I call upon the hon  Schalkwyk  to  address  the  House.
[Interjections.]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker ...

An HON MEMBER: Mooi praat, brigadier! [Speak nicely, Brigadier!]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Ek sal probeer. [I will try.]

Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, I will focus on  the  problems  of
our reserve ground force. I heard the Deputy Minister, as well  as  the  hon
Thandi Modise mention that. I will try and expand on that.

We all know  that  our  National  Defence  Force  does  not  belong  to  the
Government or the Minister as such, it belongs to the people.  And  we  must
inform the people about  what  is  going  on.  We  have  excellent  military
publications, but I wonder if they present the whole truth.

In the early 1960s the then Department of Defence tried to disband  the  so-
called traditional units, but our local communities were proverbially up  in
arms about that. It was a  tragic  period  in  the  history  of  the  army's
reserve force. Some of those  units  were  down  to  company,  squadron  and
battery levels. Moral and unit esprit de corps was destroyed,  and  it  took
the army over a decade to bring it back to combat effectiveness.

The publication on the SA National Defence Force's  reserve  force  is  very
impressive. It is a beautiful document with its  order  of  battle,  but  it
does not tell the real story. Most of  these  units  are  kept  going  by  a
number of dedicated old-timers. What  our  people  must  know  is  how  many
bayonets these listed battalions can field. The same  applies  to  how  many
qualified gun crews, with their guns, there are in the artillery  regiments,
and how many tanks and armoured car crews with their AVs, armoured  fighting
vehicles, we can muster. The same applies in respect of our air forces.

Recently emphasis has been placed on the strategic arms acquisition, to  the
detriment of the ground forces' capabilities. We  must  not  make  the  same
mistakes the government of the early 1960s made. We  must  learn  from  that
history. But I have  the  impression  that  the  reserve  forces  are  being
strangled to death because of the lack of support. This  past  year  courses
had  to  be  cancelled  owing  to  a  lack  of  funds,  and  no  substantial
conventional field exercises have taken place over the past few years.  This
has an impact on our effectiveness and the integration process.

I know of the existence of the reserve  forces'  council  and  Dr  Williams'
research on transformation, but the scoreboard still remains  the  same.  We
must wake up to the reality of the situation before  it  is  too  late.  The
longer we wait, the more serious the problem becomes.

We  have  to  lift  the  army's  reserves  up  from  its  knees.  Morale  is
progressively deteriorating by the day,  and  this  must  be  stopped.  Unit
esprit de corps must be revitalised. We owe this to the reserve  forces  and
to our people. [Applause.]

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, Comrade  Minister,  ...  lehono  ke  tlogo
buwa ka puo yame le Seisemane ... [today I will speak in  my  mother  tongue
and English.]

On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank our  outgoing  chairperson
of the Joint Standing Committee  on  Defence,  Ntshiki  Mashimbye,  for  the
excellent work done. We want to congratulate hon member  Zoe  Kota  and  hon
James  Ngculu,  who  have  been  appointed  Chairpersons  of  the  Portfolio
Committees on Housing and Health respectively. We shall  miss  them  in  the
committee and we wish them well.

I have listened to the DA when they addressed  this  House  this  afternoon,
and two of their speakers emphasised the  strategic  defence  packages.  The
predecessor of the DA, the DP, was soft on security. It  seems  to  me  that
the DA is even softer on security. [Interjections.]

The hon Schmidt referred to the strategic defence packages. I think,  and  I
suspect that it was his  master's  voice  speaking,  in  the  committee  and
during the deliberations we had in December, he could not make decisions  on
his own, he had to consult the hon  Taljaard.  And  what  happened  in  that
committee is that we confused him with facts. He could not make up  his  own
mind, it was made up for him. [Interjections.]

Today he is questioning the matter of the price. The end result of that  was
that he did not attend the meetings. He boycotted the  proceedings  and  the
DA, the then DP, soft on security, walked out of the  committee.  They  gave
themselves the  right  to  give  input  to  the  recommendations  that  very
committee made to Parliament. Our hon Minister said today that  their  input
would be entertained and taken on board.

May I just say on this whole issue of the price - and I direct this  to  hon
Schmidt - we cannot pin down the exchange rate. But  our  offer  to  him  is
that I will give him a free lesson on the economy  and  the  exchange  rate.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Boycott politics has always been counterproductive. In fact, we  have  heard
this afternoon that, halfway through  the  strategic  defence  packages,  we
should now halt and stop. [Interjections.] God  forbid  I  go  to  war  with
them, because they will run away before the war starts. [Laughter.]  The  DA
was born a tickey, and if one was born a tickey,  one  can  never  become  a
sixpence. [Laughter.]
The hon Groenewald also deprived himself ...

... van die reg op deelname. Die agb lid het die eerste  dag  daar  ingestap
en die eerste geleentheid gebruik wat hy kon kry om hom te  vervies,  kamtig
die  stoel  agtertoe  te  skop  en   te   loop   en   gaan   vakansie   hou.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is wat die agb lid gedoen het. Nou kom kla  hy  vandag
hier omdat hy vertoë rig oor 'n pensioen-uitbetaling.  Mag  ek  hom  daaraan
herinner, as hy miskien meer komiteevergaderings bywoon,  en  minder  boikot
en vakansie hou, sal hy miskien meer sukses hê, want wat  is  die  waarheid?
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Hy vra vandag hier die agb Minister uit oor die finansiering met  betrekking
tot Burundi. As hy verlede week hierdie dames en here wat agter ons  sit  se
voorligting oor die begroting bygewoon het, het hy daardie  antwoord  gehad.
Of het hy miskien gesit  en  slaap  in  daardie  verrigtings?  [Gelag.]  Die
Europese Unie  dra  ruim  by  en  so  kan  ons  voortgaan.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[... of the right to participate. The hon member walked in there  the  first
day and took the first opportunity he could find to lose his temper, make  a
show of kicking over the chair and leave, go  on  holiday.  [Interjections.]
That is what the hon member did. Now he is complaining  here  today  because
he has made representations in regard to a  pension  payout.  May  I  remind
him, if he perhaps attended more committee meetings, and boycotted less  and
went on fewer holidays, he would perhaps achieve  greater  success,  because
what is the truth? [Interjections.]

He is questioning the hon Minister today about the funding  with  regard  to
Burundi. If he attended the briefing by these ladies and gentlemen  who  are
seated behind us about the budget, he would have had that answer. Or was  he
perhaps sitting there, sleeping, during those proceedings?  [Laughter.]  The
European Union contributes generously and in that vein we can continue.]

The Department of Defence is on the threshold of a new era  in  Africa.  The
SA National Defence Force is and will remain  an  invaluable  instrument  of
the state, contributing to the  achievement  of  this  ANC-led  Government's
domestic and foreign policy objectives. By virtue  of  the  force's  design,
agreed upon in the White Paper on Defence,  it  will  be  a  lean  and  mean
machine, helping to ensure the  safety,  security  and  wellbeing  of  South
Africa and the entire region, and, when called upon,  of  the  international
community.

The vision, as stated in the Strategic Plan for the financial years  2002-03
to 2004-05, is as follows, and I quote:


  The Department of Defence ensures, in accordance with  the  Constitution,
  effective defence for a  democratic  South  Africa,  enhancing  national,
  regional and global security through  balanced,  modern,  affordable  and
  technological defence capabilities.

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: The hon Ellis should listen to  this  and  he  may  learn
something. But we do not want him in the ANC, please! [Laughter.]

Modern  communications  such  as  the  Internet,  cross-border   information
traffic and the easy movement of information have resulted  in  the  eroding
of national boundaries. The effect is that crime and terrorism  have  become
globalised. This has forced security agencies to co-operate beyond  national
borders with their counterparts worldwide. Africa will be  no  exception  to
the fact that peaceful coexistence is  a  matter  of  prime  importance  for
development and prosperity.

As Nepad  takes  shape,  security  on  the  African  continent  is  becoming
increasingly important, to ensure that we meet  its  objectives.  It  is  in
this regard that the SA National Defence  Force  must  fulfil  the  role  of
peacekeeper  and  peace  supporter.  Our  force  design  will  have  to   be
revolutionary,  progressive  and  realistic  in  order   to   assist   wider
Government decision-making.

The SA National Defence Force would have to answer the call of regional  and
international duty; we will have to respond to  the  call  of  international
and regional peace-making, peacekeeping  and  peace-building.  This  we  are
already doing with distinction, and I  wish  to  congratulate  the  hon  the
Minister and the Defence Force on the leadership they are providing in  this
regard.

Liberty, law and opportunity are some of  the  conditions  for  development.
This  is  why  the  success  of  Nepad  will  promote  economic  growth  and
sustainable economic development in an environment of democracy,  peace  and
stability. South Africa is adequately equipped to  play  its  role  in  this
regard. I  say  this  because  it  is  in  South  Africa  where  a  conflict
environment has been replaced by a negotiated settlement. This is where  the
role of the Defence Force and the  force  design  have  been  altered,  with
global emphasis on peace negotiations rather than outright  wars,  and  that
may be good news for the DA.

I would like to answer something that the hon Blaas  touched  upon  in  this
debate.

Mr T D LEE: Are you the Minister now?

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: No, I am not the  Minister,  I  am  an  hon  member!  The
difference between the hon Lee and myself is I have no  price  tag,  but  he
has one. We know that. [Laughter.] [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, is that member prepared to take a question?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are you prepared to take a question, hon member?

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, if I have time at the end of my  speech  I
would entertain intelligent questions! [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!
Mr K M  ANDREW:  Madam  Speaker,  on  a  point  of  order:  The  hon  member
Oosthuizen's comment that a member had a price tag is clearly  a  reflection
on the integrity of the member. [Interjections.] It is  unparliamentary  and
I request you to ask him to withdraw it.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I would have to consider that  issue.
I am not sure that it  is  necessarily  unparliamentary.  I  would  have  to
consider that and then come back with a ruling.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, it is against  this  background  that  our
presence in the DRC conference at Sun City and our  peacekeeping  forces  in
Burundi should be judged. In fact, what matters  is  strategic  success  for
our continent. Measure us by the results achieved, rather  than  the  amount
of money we budget for these operations. The New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development plan has its focus on Africa taking responsibility for  its  own
security problems. It implies that intervention will only be in  partnership
with other countries and  will  be  a  peace-supporting  role  and  not  the
apartheid-type  raid  on  neighbouring  countries.   This   emphasises   the
importance of combined operations by African countries for Africa.

Despite moves towards peace in our region and continent, it  would  be  wise
and advisable to plan and budget for more frequent and longer peace  support
missions. The force design must include our intelligence ability to  improve
the early warning systems. The nature of our intelligence  should  not  only
be complementary to other sources, but  should  also  support  the  strategy
aimed at rooting out warlords who lead bandit-type forces on our  continent.
Sometimes those forces are armed with guns  and  rocket-propelled  grenades.
In short, the defence intelligence division must  provide  for  intelligence
collection and holistic assessments  which  would  assist  wider  Government
decision-making.

The DA's Mr Jankielsohn today said we had to revise our  strategic  plan  on
defence. We have an agreed force design as reflected in the White  Paper  on
Defence. The strategic plan for  the  financial  years  2002-03  to  2004-05
states, and I quote:


  In response to changes in the  environment  the  present  approved  force
  design is currently under review.

So I refer the  hon  Jankielsohn  to  the  strategic  plan  for  those  very
financial years. He may be enlightened if he  read  that.  Mindful  of  this
statement, I ask whether the light mobility will form part of the new  force
design and the new structure. Should this be the case, the  emphasis  should
be on light mobile strategy, enabling South Africa to deploy military  power
by air. Implicit is the ability we have  in  terms  of  transport  aircraft,
which should be under review if this is the route we go. Equally, so  should
be the consideration of the anti-tank missile system  for  use  in  airborne
operations. Our  planning  should  also  include  the  upkeep  and  constant
upgrading of our heavy ground weapon systems, which must be maintained.

The  SA  National  Defence  Force  should  also  confront  the  major  human
resources challenges it has.  The  profile,  the  age  and  the  fitness  of
personnel must  be  a  source  of  strategic  planning  sessions  where  the
emphasis should be on overcoming the lack  of  skills  development  and  the
constraints of recruitment. The evaluation of personnel and  the  strategies
embarked upon should be mindful that South Africa is a  regional  power  and
therefore  viable  strategies  should  make  provision   for   the   overall
composition of the South African forces.

In the last  minute  or  two  at  my  disposal  I  would  like  to  turn  to
mobilisation.

Ons het verlede jaar voorligting deur die  kommando's  by  die  Gesamentlike
Komitee oor Verdediging  gehad,  getuienis  aangehoor  oor  die  tekort  aan
ervare leierskap en derhalwe addisionele fondse benodig om lede op  te  lei.
Die  demobilisasie  bied  aan  die  kommando's  'n  geleentheid   om   reeds
goedopgeleide leiers te werf en op dié wyse waarskynlik in hul behoefte  aan
leierskap te voorsien. My versoek aan die kommando's  daar  buite  is:  Gryp
hierdie  geleentheid  aan.  Verryk  die  geledere  van  die  kommando's  met
leierskap wat daartoe sal bydra dat die negatiewe beeld van  die  kommando's
omgekeer kan word en dit in 'n positiewe stap voorwaarts die toekoms in  kan
wees. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Last year, we had a briefing by the commandos at the meeting of  the  Joint
Committee on Defence, we heard evidence about the  shortage  of  experienced
leadership and that consequently additional funds are  needed  in  order  to
train members. Demobilisation is giving commandos an opportunity to  recruit
already well-trained leaders and in  this  way  probably  provide  in  their
leadership requirements. My request to commandos out  there  is:  Grab  this
opportunity. Enrich the rank and file of the commandos with leadership  that
will contribute to reversing the negative image of the  commandos  and  that
it may be a positive step forward into the future.]

In conclusion, I also urge those members who are being demobilised  to  take
up their role in the communities, being  ever  mindful  of  the  code  of  a
soldier and that that code is to serve with  honesty  and  integrity.  Their
contribution in the community, if they are demobilised in the reserve  force
of the commando, would  be  invaluable  to  this  wonderful  country,  South
Africa. I trust that they will take  up  this  challenge  to  serve  and  to
create a better life for all. [Applause.]

Mr L T LANDERS: Madam Speaker, before you recognise the  hon  the  Minister,
may I raise a point of order?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! What is the point of order, hon member?

Mr L T LANDERS: During Mr  Oosthuizen's  address,  the  hon  Groenewald  was
heard by way of an interjection to use the words ``die  baas  se  hond''  or
``die baas se honde'. I submit to you that this is  unparliamentary,  but  I
ask for your ruling in this regard.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Just say that again. What did he  say?  What  was
the word? Hon Groenewald, would you like to ...

Mr L T LANDERS: He said: ``Die baas se honde.''

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!  Would  you  like  to  address  the  House,  hon
Groenewald?

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, die agb lid is verkeerd.  Ek  het  nooit
gepraat van die ``baas se honde'' nie. Ek het gesê: ``Oubaas se honne.''  En
ek staan daarby. [Madam Speaker, the hon member  is  wrong.  I  never  spoke
about ``baas se honde''  [the  dogs  of  the  boss].  I  said"  ``Oubaas  se
honne.'' [the master's little dog].

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Groenewald, I did not hear your  explanation.
I am sorry.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, toe  die  agb  lid  Oosthuizen  gepraat
het, het hy onder andere ook na my verwys. Toe  het  ek  gesê:  ``Oubaas  se
honne.'' Wat dit beteken, is dat hy soos 'n hondjie is. As die  baas  praat,
dan lê hy op sy ruggie en doen net wat die baas sê hy moet doen. Dit is  wat
die agb Oosthuizen is. Hy is oubaas  se  honne.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.]

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, when the hon member Oosthuizen spoke,  he
inter alia made reference to me. Then I said: ``Oubaas se honne.''  What  it
means is that he is like a little dog. If the master speaks, he  falls  onto
his back and does just what the master tells him to. That is  what  the  hon
Oosthuizen is. He is ``oubaas se honne''.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Jy is ounooi se honne. Jy is ounooi se  honne!  [You  are  the
mistress's little dog! You are the mistress's little dog!]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I think this whole issue is  getting
a bit involved, and I really would not  like  us  to  share  our  time  this
afternoon with this particular matter which has  come  up.  In  fact,  I  am
interested in hearing what happened exactly - what the member said and  what
he meant - so I am going to pursue it, but not here,  not  now.  So  I  will
follow it up later.

The  MINISTER  OF  DEFENCE:  Madam  Speaker,  I  rise  with  a  measure   of
disappointment. In the  course  of  his  address  to  this  House,  the  hon
Groenewald made remarks in reference to one of the senior  generals  of  the
national Defence  Force,  suggesting  that  the  general  had  access  to  a
Mercedes Benz in the course of the  acquisition  of  the  strategic  defence
package.

This House earlier on ordered an investigation by the agencies.  This  issue
was raised in the public  media  and  the  reputation  of  the  general  was
exposed to  being  undermined,  because  when  the  investigation  had  been
carried out, there was  no  link  whatsoever  between  the  vehicle  of  the
general and the investigation that was going on.

For members of the Joint Committee on Defence,  who  should  have  been  the
foremost people to know what the contents of that report was  and  that  not
even one word had ever been said about the general in that report,  then  to
come and stand before this House and  cast  aspersions  of  that  nature  is
unfair, cowardly and destructive.

If any member of this House is going to attack the integrity of  the  office
of the national Defence Force without  grounds,  I  will  not  accept  that.
[Interjections.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, is the hon the  Minister  willing  to  take  a
question on this issue?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I am not taking a question on  that.
I am dealing with this issue, so I do not need a question.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Minister is not prepared to  take  a  question,  hon
member.

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, on a point of order.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is the point of order?

Ms R TALJAARD: Is it parliamentary for the Minister ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I would like to hear  what  the  hon
member is saying.

Ms R TALJAARD: Is it parliamentary  for  the  Minister  to  give  a  factual
inaccuracy to the House in relation to the report of  the  joint  inspection
team.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, it is your point of view that  he  is
inaccurate. So it has nothing to do with  anything  parliamentary  when  you
are actually expressing an opinion as to what he is  saying  is  inaccurate.
Please take your seat now, hon member. I have answered you.

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Is it in  order  for  the
hon the Minister to refer to the behaviour of members as cowardly?  Is  that
parliamentary?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I contend that it is  parliamentary.
I am not expressing an opinion.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The hon member  has  raised  an  issue  with  the
Chair and I would like to deal with that particular issue. In terms  of  the
way we express ourself in Parliament, we  do  not  encourage  language  like
cowardly to one another. We generally regard that as unparliamentary.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:  Madam  Speaker,  thank  you  very  much.  However,
members of this House, because they have the privilege of speaking  in  this
House and they  cannot  be  challenged  by  officials  of  Government,  take
advantage as they come and stand in this House, making  allegations  against
people who are defenceless, when they are defended. They must go outside  of
this House and make those statements so that I should not have to  say  they
are cowards, but ...

... as 'n mens hier inkom en bewerings maak wat nie gegrond is nie,  is  dit
net nie onaanvaarbaar nie. Dit is net nie reg nie. Die  hele  reputasie  van
dié Regering word beswadder. [Applous.] Ek moet aanvaar, almal van ons  hier
...

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, is die agb Minister bereid om 'n  vraag
te beantwoord? [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek vra dit vir die agb Minister en nie  vir
die ander lede nie. Is hy bereid om 'n vraag oor hierdie spesifieke saak  te
beantwoord, siende dat hy my aanval?

Die MINISTER VAN  VERDEDIGING:  Nee,  ek  is  nie  bereid  om  'n  vraag  te
beantwoord nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[... when one comes here and makes unfounded allegations,  it  is  not  only
unacceptable. It is just not right. The reputation of the  whole  Government
is being maligned. [Applause.] I must accept, all of us here ...

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, is the hon the Minister prepared  to  take
a question. [Interjections.] I am asking  the  hon  Minister,  and  not  the
other members. Is he  prepared  to  take  a  question  about  this  specific
matter, seeing that he is attacking me?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: No, I am not prepared to take a question.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Then you are a coward!

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Ek sal dit in die komitee  beantwoord.  Op  hierdie
oomblik is ek besig om te antwoord. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek is besig. [I  shall
answer it in the committee. At present I am making my reply. I am busy.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Groenewald, I do not encourage that  kind  of
behaviour. You asked whether the hon the  Minister  would  like  to  take  a
question and he said no. But he is prepared to engage you in the  committee,
and I think that the matter can be pursued outside the House. I  would  like
the Minister to proceed with his speech.

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, could I address you on this point of order?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes.

Mr T D LEE: You made a ruling, but ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Coetzee, please take your seat.

Mr T D LEE: You made a ruling, Madam Speaker, but it seems to me as  if  the
hon the Minister does not accept it. I have not  heard  him  apologising  or
saying I am sorry and retracting his words.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Right! Hon Minister, on the issue of  having  said  that
the hon member is a coward, I would like you to withdraw that.  However,  it
does not mean you are unable to make your point. I think your point  can  be
made without the word ``coward''. I would just  like  you  to  withdraw  the
question of the ``coward''.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I did not say that the member  is  a
coward! I said it was ``cowardly behaviour''. He has said  I  am  a  coward.
Not that it will harm me. It will  not  harm  me  and  it  will  not  change
anything. I am not  even  going  to  ask  him  to  withdraw  that.  But  the
behaviour of taking advantage of people who are defenceless  is  what  I  am
talking about. It is cowardly, not the  individual.  I  am  not  saying  the
individual is a coward. [Applause.]

Ms N G W BOTHA: Madam Speaker, on a point  of  order:  The  hon  Groenewald,
despite what the Minister has just said, has referred to the Minister  as  a
coward directly, so could you make a ruling on that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Botha, that is an  issue  which  occurred  as
the hon member was going to take his seat,  and  I  have  addressed  him  on
that. I do not,  really,  want  to  have  this  House  degenerating  into  a
question of a back-and-forth scenario. I would like the hon the Minister  to
continue to make his remarks. Otherwise we are going to spend  the  rest  of
the evening having this back-and-forth scenario about this  cowardly  thing.
Hon Minister, could you please finish off your speech.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Andrew I do not want you to pursue the  issue
of the Minister's words and Mr Groenewald's words. I would not like  you  to
pursue that ...

Mr K M ANDREW: No, it is an issue of your ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: If that is what you are  ...  [Interjections.]  No,  hon
Andrew, ...

Mr K M ANDREW: Those are not his words.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Andrew, please  take  your  seat.  I  am  not
allowing you to do that. I would like the Minister to now continue with  his
speech. Hon Andrew, I would not  like  you  to  go  on  with  that  kind  of
attitude. I would like to proceed with the proceedings of  this  House.  Hon
Minister, please finish your speech.

The MINISTER OF  DEFENCE:  Thank  you,  Madam  Speaker.  There  has  been  a
suggestion that there is a  need  for  this  country  to  undertake  another
Defence Review. I would like to say that there is no need  to  do  that.  At
the beginning of this democratic period, the  country  undertook  a  Defence
White  Paper  process  and  determined  policy.  It  proceeded  to  evaluate
defences under the Defence Review and determined the overall  needs  of  the
country for purposes of its security into the future.

That Defence Review was not  intended  for  two  or  three  months;  it  was
intended for the  long-term  defence  of  this  country.  The  executive  is
engaged  in  acquiring  those  capabilities  that  have  been   ordered   by
Parliament within the constraints of the budget, and it  is  going  to  take
some time to get there. This is a journey that we have embarked on,  and  we
cannot turn back now.

Secondly, the strategic Defence appreciation  is  a  process  undertaken  by
South Africa's foremost military minds at this time, to assess from time  to
time, and to check from day to day and in a vigilant  manner,  whether  this
country is able to respond to  any  eventuality  wherever  its  security  is
threatened. This strategic Defence appreciation  in  which  Gen  Nyanda  and
other leaders of the SA National Defence Force, trained men  and  women  who
are experts in their field, are engaged and  are  evaluating  and  adjusting
every now then. It is sufficient for the security  of  all  the  members  in
this House and this nation as a whole.

We do not need anybody else to interfere with that, least of all  schoolboys
who came into this House a few months ago. [Laughter.]

The third issue is that part of that process of making sure that  we  manage
our defence comprises of some of the steps we  are  taking  today.  We  have
removed some of the Defence personnel which was surrounding little  Lesotho,
and we are not going to return them there. They were put there  by  the  old
apartheid regime when it thought that the attack to itself would  come  from
inside Lesotho. [Interjections.]

Today there is no threat coming out of Lesotho that requires us to  surround
that little country with armed forces. The issue of stock theft  and  things
like that are the task of the SA Police Service, and I am not going  to  put
soldiers there for that purpose. [Interjections.] It would  be  a  waste  of
time and money for this country. [Interjections.]

Part of the process of dealing with the question of Defence expenditure  and
even the deployment of  personnel  is  that  at  the  present  time  we  are
identifying some of the members of the National Defence Force whom  we  want
to remuster in other services. They are not junk. These are  men  and  women
of quality with outstanding records. [Interjections.]

We do not want their services to be lost  to  this  nation  because  the  SA
National Defence Force has to  be  pared  to  the  numbers  that  have  been
ordered by this House. Instead of throwing them out into the street when  we
actually need them elsewhere, we are remustering them in other services,  so
that this country continues to benefit from their  expertise  and  training,
and the general investment that has been put into their training.

In the time that is left, I would like to turn to the issue of  the  region.
We deployed our forces in Burundi, not because of a Big Brother attitude  or
because we were looking for adventure. The security of the  people  of  this
country is very much predicated upon the stability  of  the  entire  region.
And unless we can stabilise the countries that are surrounding our  country,
the security of the people of this country is very brittle.

The numbers of men and women who are running from conflict and pouring  into
this country are staggering. The prisons are  overflowing,  and  the  police
stations are full. We are arresting 1 000 and more every month only  between
Messina and Louis Trichardt. People are pouring into  the  country  in  this
way because of conflict, tension, starvation  and  the  instability  of  the
economies in their own countries. This country cannot hope to remain  stable
when these people pour in in those numbers.

First of all, if one arrests them in Bloemfontein or Johannesburg,  one  has
to put them in a police station and give them food;  if  they  become  sick,
one has to give them medical care; if they  have  no  clothes,  one  has  to
clothe them; and then, lastly, one has to give them free transport  back  to
their  countries.  It  is  extremely  expensive  to  allow  a  situation  of
overflowing tension in the Southern African region.

That is why we deployed our forces in Burundi. We are doing something  which
perhaps many South Africans or the opposition  do  not  understand.  But  we
have  done  something  with  Burundi   for   international   peace   support
operations. We did not do this blindly. From these men  and  women  who  are
sitting behind me and in the gallery, we sent experts to Burundi. Some  were
in intelligence and others were top generals.

They went in and studied that  situation  and  made  recommendations  as  to
whether it was possible for South Africa to  deploy  forces  there  or  not,
even though the mechanical prescriptions  of  the  United  Nations  required
certain conditions. They came back to report, and they recommended  that  we
could  deploy  forces  there,  thereby  sustaining  and  supporting  Foreign
Affairs, and  supporting  the  peace  process,  even  though  there  was  no
ceasefire in place. It was November when we first put them there. It is  now
May, and not a single shot has  been  fired  in  the  direction  of  the  SA
National Defence Force personnel deployed there. This confirms the  accuracy
of the assessment made by the men and women who did that work. [Applause.]

That was not a matter of adventure. The challenge of the continent  is  that
Africa must take the lead in establishing peace, because nations outside  of
this continent are not prepared to come in here and bring  their  young  men
and women, thereby throwing  them  into  foreign  terrain  where  their  ...
[Interjections] ... commitment is less.  We  have  no  other  continent  but
Africa ... [Interjections] ... and we have to go back there. But, as I  have
said, we must not do that as a  matter  of  adventure.  It  has  got  to  be
studied and done very carefully. That is what  these  experts,  led  by  Gen
Nyanda, have done, and that is why we are going on with that work.

The reputation and the standing of our country has  been  raised  to  levels
unknown since before we came into power. Therefore I would like  to  say  to
my colleagues in the House, both from my  party  and  from  the  opposition,
that we must accept this responsibility as a country that South Africa  must
lead, because other countries lack both the expertise and the ability to  do
so, and also because we have benefited so much from them in  the  course  of
the struggle to democratise our country.

The lives of the people of very poor countries which had  nothing  were  put
at risk. In  Lesotho  people  were  slaughtered;  in  Botswana  people  were
smashed; in Zimbabwe buildings were brought down;  and  in  Matola  hundreds
were killed. Not only did they give money, but they also gave the  lives  of
their people for our democracy. [Applause.] Today we can afford to  be  here
and have peace. [Applause.]

If I may, I would like to say something with regard to another issue.  There
have been a lot of jokes about the issue of Zimbabwe  and  what  I  said  on
Friday.

First of all, if there is an impression anywhere that I did not support  the
approach of Government in Zimbabwe, that is a  mistaken  impression.  I  was
one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the  approach  of  Government  in
Zimbabwe. I have led missions, and they were not only  delegations  from  my
party. I have been sent there by  the  President  on  several  occasions  to
support the work that was being done there.

At no stage have I ever suggested to my colleagues,  inside  or  outside  of
Cabinet, that I thought we should take a  different  route.  If  there  have
been failures, and if we have not achieved what  we  wanted  to  achieve  in
Zimbabwe, I am as responsible for that as all the others.

However, it is a mistake to adopt an  attitude  which  suggests  that  South
Africa's Cabinet is made of little boys and girls who cannot hold  or  apply
their personal judgments to issues. That is a big mistake.

The President, who is not here  today,  is  not  a  man  who  enjoys  having
lapdogs. He wants watchdogs. He wants to engage in robust debate,  which  we
do. [Interjections.]

Of course, that is why I can say that  my  own  view  is  that  we  did  not
achieve as much as we thought we would  achieve.  Not  that  that  is  news.
There are many people who hold views like that. Even in Cabinet, I am  sure,
there are others who feel that way, but all of us are convinced  that  there
is no other route to take regarding Zimbabwe.  The  only  correct  route  to
follow is the one we are following, and we will continue to do so.

So, I was not making those comments jokingly. It  is  a  matter  of  serious
concern for us in respect of what the security of our  region  is  going  to
be.  We  take  that   responsibility.   [Interjections.]   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                       Debate on Vote No 17 - Housing:

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Madam Speaker, hon members, it is now  eight  years
since we started with the housing programme, which is directed at  improving
the living conditions of our people.

For all practical purposes,  implementation  of  the  1994  White  Paper  on
Housing has been completed, and although the basic tenets of the policy  are
sound, some gaps still remain. Whereas housing  was  used  as  part  of  the
control mechanism of the apartheid government, we have said that housing  is
an essential pillar of our policy to create a better life for all.

This is a basic right we are striving to ensure the progressive  realisation
of through the biggest and most widely spread spending on social budgets  by
any government in the history of South Africa. It is at the  height  of  the
transformation and development programme of our  country  for  better  human
settlements. Various policy instruments are still relatively new, and  their
impact is still to be felt, especially in rural areas where development  has
been retarded on account of tenure uncertainty and capacity constraints.  As
a  result,  certain  policy  outcomes  have  not  fully  met  some  of   the
expectations and the full spectrum of housing needs have yet to  be  met  in
the most economic, efficient and effective manner possible.

We have successfully shifted the  focus  from  policy-making  of  the  early
years to implementation, to  policy  enhancement  and  refinement.  This  is
informed by the experience and dynamics of housing provision  and  the  need
to improve performance in the housing  sector.  In  future,  more  attention
will be paid to monitoring and performance evaluation to assess the  various
policies, strategies and programmes.
While housing  delivery  has  reached  optimum  levels  in  so  far  as  the
available budget  is  concerned,  we  have  shifted  emphasis  to  the  more
qualitative aspects of delivery.  Our  efforts  are  more  directed  to  the
streamlining of procedures, increasing administrative  efficiency,  ensuring
quality housing products, better value for money and broadening  choice  for
our communities.  We  are  adjusting  our  approaches  to  ensure  that,  by
contributing their own efforts for their housing, more  of  our  people  can
benefit more quickly.

Today, as the democratically elected Parliament of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa debates the Housing budget for this financial year,  we  can  rightly
say that housing is well on track,  and  is  a  significant  thrust  in  our
strategy to transform and stabilise society.

The preamble of the Housing Act of 1997 recognises housing as a  key  sector
of the national economy. Housing is  an  important  contributor  to  growth,
employment  creation  and  wealth  generation.  Housing  has  a  low  import
propensity, and  its  forward  and  backward  linkages  to  the  development
process stimulate economic activity across  a  broad  spectrum  of  economic
sectors. Low-cost housing, in particular, lends itself  to  labour-intensive
practices that provide work for people with relatively low skills levels.

For these reasons and a host of others, housing  is  a  growth  catalyst  of
inestimable value to the socioeconomic well-being of  the  nation.  However,
housing  is  not  able  to  function  properly  unless  prevailing  economic
conditions are conducive to growth and  investment.  Unfortunately  for  us,
growth has been sluggish, and many negative factors have had to be  overcome
but, potentially, housing can be  a  major  engine  of  national  and  local
economic growth.

The use of local labour and small contractors in housing development is  one
of the guiding principles of the Housing  Subsidy  Programme  which  ensured
the circulation of  wages  in  local  economies  and  resulted  in  a  local
multiplier effect. Correctly designed and regulated, housing can  serve  the
dual purposes of providing living and working space for purposes  of  income
generation.

Inflation in the building and construction  industry,  and  in  the  housing
sector has been contained to single digit figures for several years now.  In
this  climate  of  growing  confidence  and  against   the   background   of
expectations of accelerated economic  growth,  the  state-assisted  delivery
segment of  the  housing  market  came  under  pressure  as  developers  and
contractors left the settlement for  the  less  risky  and  more  profitable
middle and high-income housing market.

To achieve the objective of sustainable investment in low-cost  housing,  we
aim  to  introduce  measures  to  improve  efficiency  in  housing   subsidy
administration,   reduce   administrative   risks   that   inhibit   private
investment, ensure a fair and equitable system  of  competitive  procurement
in respect of housing development contracts that emanate from  the  National
Housing Subsidy Programme, and  to  promote  appropriate  training  in  home
building  construction  and  management  to  ensure  adequate  quality   and
capacity among emerging building contractors from  previously  disadvantaged
groups, provincial and local government  officials  and  consumer  education
for low-income earners.

Although the rent and services and bonds boycotts belong to the past,  their
legacy will be with us  for  a  considerable  time,  because  the  scars  of
consequential impoverishment and entrenched forms  of  behaviour  heal  very
slowly. The  normalisation  of  the  housing  environment  was  one  of  the
strategic thrusts of the 1994 White Paper on Housing. We continue  with  our
efforts in support of the normalisation process.

For as long as the situation is perceived  not  to  have  been  sufficiently
normalised, Government  will  have  to  manage  inherent  risks  if  private
investment in housing is to reach desired levels. In  mitigation  of  risks,
Government is committed to political and administrative certainty.  We  will
continue to consistently apply housing policy and strategy in  an  efficient
and  effective  manner  within  the  framework  of  an  enabling  regulatory
environment.

Our continued assessment reveals that  our  policy  has  had  an  unintended
consequence, which is dependency, which negates self-sufficiency. Our  noble
intentions of providing basic shelter to the poor have also  promoted  total
dependency on the state providing for all.

But, contrary to this, two glaring truths about our  country  are  apparent.
Firstly, thousands of stokvels and societies or social clubs  exist  in  our
communities and are proof that our people are not only  capable  of  saving,
but that they indeed do so in a  very  organised  and  disciplined  fashion.
Secondly, the  ingenuity  of  the  informal  settlements  and  the  building
traditions of the rural areas show that our people are ready and willing  to
contribute their own labour to improving their housing if sweat is the  only
equity they can afford.

The monetary value we have placed on  the  beneficiary  contribution  is  R2
479, and there will be three ways in which contributions are made.  Firstly,
through a savings scheme, either with a bank or  a  non-traditional  savings
institution. Secondly, in the form of a small or microloan  from  a  lender.
Thirdly, for anyone who has neither the means  to  save  nor  the  necessary
standing with lenders, the amount can be contributed in the  form  of  sweat
equity or work on the house construction as is done in the People's  Housing
Process.

This contribution will become an integral part of our subsidy programme  and
will facilitate improvement on  the  quality  of  the  houses  to  meet  the
requirement of the Housing Consumer  Protection  Measures  Act  through  the
National Home Builders Registration Council standards.

There will now be a condition for getting a Government housing  subsidy,  ie
a contribution of R2 479 for each and every recipient  of  a  subsidy,  with
effect from April 2002. [Applause.]

There will be very clear and  narrowly  defined  exceptions  to  this  rule,
which will be applied  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  I  can  indicate  that
Government does not believe that it would  be  fair  to  expect  differently
abled people, pensioners and the indigent, to contribute  to  their  housing
in this way. Under this new  dispensation,  these  special  categories  will
receive the  full  amount  of  the  subsidy  without  having  to  make  this
contribution. But we still wish to encourage the young  and  able-bodied  to
play a meaningful role in acquiring their homes.

Therefore,  housing  subsidies  as  currently  structured  tend  to  promote
dependency on state support and negate self-sufficiency. Savings  and  sweat
equity  contributions  by  prospective  homeowners,  which  have  not   been
encouraged  enough  up  to  now,  are  now  the  central   thrust   of   our
subsidisation programme. Our aim  is  to  combat  dependency  and  its  twin
sister, disempowerment, in favour of self-sufficiency and its  twin  sister,
sense of ownership, not only on the  question  of  individual  housing,  but
also of the country.

Our people can contribute through savings and sweat  equity  to  empowerment
and sustainable  development.  To  match  this,  Government  has  agreed  to
support their efforts by increasing its  contribution  through  the  housing
subsidy.

Today I am extremely pleased to be able to announce to the House and to  the
nation an increase in the housing  subsidy  of  between  28,8%  and  57,64%.
[Applause.] This is not only compensation for  the  inflationary  effect  on
the subsidy, but results in real improvement in the houses to be built  from
this financial year onwards.

This increase is intended to benefit the poor by  affording  them  a  better
house when combined with their own contribution. It is not intended to  line
the pockets  of  developers,  builders  and  material  suppliers  with  more
profit. This increase is a deliberate incentive on  our  part  to  encourage
savings and own contributions.

Today I can announce that the R16 000 subsidy will be increased to R20  300,
a 26,87% increase for those earning an  income  of  less  than  R1  500  per
month.  [Applause.]  [Interjections.]  There  will  be  a  R10  000  subsidy
increase to R14 000, a 48,8% increase for those within the  category  of  R1
501 to R2 500 income bracket. To those who have  been  receiving  a  R5  500
subsidy, this will be increased to R8 200, a 54% increase for  those  within
the category of R2 501  and  R3  500  income  bracket.  For  the  aged,  the
differently abled and the indigent, the subsidy increase is from R16 000  to
R22 800, an increase of 42,5%. The consolidation subsidy  will  increase  by
R2 400 from the current R8 500 to R10 900, an increase of  28,23%,  and  for
the aged, the disabled and the indigent from R4 900 to R13 400, an  increase
of 57,64%. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Sorry,  hon  Minister,  may  I
just take a minute of your time. Honourable members of  the  public  in  the
gallery, we know that this is good news, but the  ruling  of  the  House  is
that you do not participate or applaud in the proceedings of the  House.  We
therefore appeal to you to observe the proceedings, but not to  disrupt  the
speakers at the podium.
The  MINISTER  OF  HOUSING:  Chairperson,  overall,  the  housing   budget's
additional amount for the increase in the subsidy is as  follows:  For  this
financial year, 2002-03, it will be R300 million;  for  the  next  financial
year, 2003-04, it will be R579 million and for the financial  year  2004-05,
it will be R574 million.

In December 2001 Cabinet approved the  application  and  expenditure  of  an
additional allocation, which entails an  increase  in  the  quantum  of  the
subsidy - dealing with inflation; a medium-density housing programme  -  R27
000 subsidy; and enhancement of  quality  of  houses  -  the  National  Home
Builders Registration Council warranty scheme and own contribution.  Details
on the allocation of funds to provinces are provided in Annexure  A  of  the
copies of this speech.

This is a clear message that Government is willing to  help  those  who  can
help themselves, and yet create a safety net for those  who  are  truly  not
able to fend for themselves. It is a  message  that  confirms  that  housing
remains a priority for the ANC-led Government.

As we move forward in our quest for providing more opportunities  for  those
in need of housing, we are determined that the  quality  of  the  individual
house in our towns, cities and villages should improve.

From a policy perspective, criticism indicates that too  much  emphasis  was
initially placed on ownership. This is understandable  when  viewed  against
the  background  of  past  deprivation  of  property  rights  affecting  the
majority of the population. However, a more balanced approach  is  indicated
- hence recent initiatives to normalise the rent housing market and  promote
alternative tenure options.

The lack of a comprehensive rental housing policy has been recognised  as  a
shortcoming and a process has  been  initiated  to  fulfil  this  need.  The
Rental Housing  Act  of  1999  has  been  adopted  and  the  Social  Housing
Foundation has been statutorily  recognised  and  mandated  to  promote  the
concept of co-operative housing  and  to  assist  in  the  establishment  of
institutions to hold and manage housing stock on a sustainable basis.

The National Presidential Jobs Summit housing pilot programmes  will  inform
the process of  establishing  rental  housing  policy.  Various  options  of
providing rental housing,  based  on  a  holistic,  viable  and  sustainable
process of integrated community development, will be tested. The  department
has  finalised  the  drafting  of  the  social  housing  policy  which  will
constitute a greater part of our drive to promoting rental housing.

The Hostel Redevelopment Programme will  also  become  a  second  thrust  in
promoting rental housing. The programme  focuses  on  providing  choice  and
encouraging  the  development  of   family   units   at   affordable   rent.
Transformation and redevelopment of hostels is key  to  the  restoration  of
dignity to this sector of our society, the hostel dwellers. It  is  intended
to reverse the worst kind  of  discrimination,  which  forced  many  of  our
people to live in overcrowded single-sex hostels, and denied them the  right
to live with their families.

To add insult to injury, these hostels had  minimum  or  no  facilities  and
were  isolated  from  surrounding  communities.  We  need  only  recall  the
bloodshed in the early 1990s to know  that  never  again  should  people  be
expected to live under such conditions, robbed of the very basics  of  their
dignity.

A draft social housing Bill was developed last year. This Bill is  currently
being refined in line with the social  housing  policy  discussion  document
that has been developed. It aims to establish a sustainable  social  housing
process. It provides for the establishment of the office  of  the  registrar
of social housing institutions, and  it  affords  statutory  recognition  to
housing institutions. This office  will  establish  accreditation  processes
and criteria for housing institutions and generally  regulate,  inspect  and
do  all  things  that  are  necessary  to   ensure   good   governance   and
sustainability of housing institutions.

Eight years since we began the housing programme, we  can  rightfully  point
to many achievements. Even by international standards, we can  point  to  an
unprecedented rate of delivery which resulted in 1,325 million houses  built
or under construction, and  a  total  expenditure  by  Government  of  R18,4
billion which has provided over 5 million  people  who  previously  did  not
have shelter, a place they can call home.

I would be failing in my duty if I did  not  also  indicate  the  challenges
that we face. A number of our housing instruments are still  relatively  new
and their full positive impact is  still  to  be  felt  at  the  grass-roots
level. This is especially the case in  rural  areas  where  development  has
sometimes been retarded  on  account  of  tenure  uncertainty  and  capacity
constraints,  and  the  slow  transfer  of  land  and  delays  in   township
establishment procedures sometimes due  to  capacity  constraints  at  local
government level.

The re-emergence of the problem of underspending in some  of  the  provinces
indicates insufficient capacity at provincial and local  government  levels.
But the summary of expenditure analysis by provinces  reveals  that  we  are
again faced with the challenge of  underexpenditure  in  certain  provinces,
not all but in certain provinces.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: ANC provinces.

The  MINISTER:  That  is  nonsense.  Some  of  these  provinces  have   been
experiencing underspending since the beginning  of  the  financial  year  of
2001-02. The  reasons  that  have  been  advanced  for  this  situation  are
summarised as follows: slow processing of the transfer  of  land;  the  slow
process of accrediting the  local  authorities;  late  finalisation  of  new
contracts with developers because business plans were not yet in  place;  in
the Western Cape, expenditure started very slowly in the first half  of  the
year due to the high number of projects that were in  the  final  stages  of
completion and which were affected by slow transfer;  new  local  government
structures that have to take responsibility for approving or  reprioritising
projects; delays in decision-making processes; and,  of  course,  unseasonal
or unusually wet weather and floods, which have nothing to do with the  ANC,
but are related to nature.

A document researched for SADC on  corruption  revealed  disturbing  results
from which we as a country should learn. In a survey sampling  about  2  200
respondents conducted between 6 July and 3 August 2000, the  research  found
that beneficiaries of government services in a number of member  states  had
been asked for bribes before they could  get  a  house,  with  4%  of  those
interviewed confirming this. The  form  of  corruption  mentioned  by  those
interviewed, amongst others, was that beneficiaries are often  asked  for  a
bribe in order to qualify irregularly  when  they  actually  are  above  the
scales set for beneficiaries. I will limit myself here  to  housing  matters
only, as my interpretation of the survey.

When talking to beneficiaries through regular interaction, I  have  gathered
from them that women have been asked to provide sexual favours  before  they
could get  a  house;  individuals  not  qualifying  for  a  housing  subsidy
accessed the subsidy - this constitutes corruption because  those  subsidies
are meant for the poorest of the poor; individuals accessing more  than  one
subsidy and being assisted by some officials or councillors in doing  so  is
a matter to be clarified by the  investigation;  individuals  receiving  the
RDP  houses,  but  using  those  houses  for  unacceptable  activities  like
brothels; and people exchanging the RDP houses without  following  the  pre-
emptive clause requirements. If those people are identified, the  law  shall
take its course. The survey that I am  talking  about  does  not  put  South
Africa in a  desperate  state  because  I  think  that  this  Government  is
determined to deal with corruption.

I have the pleasure of announcing that the investigation  task  team  tasked
with investigating fraud, corruption,  maladministration  and  mismanagement
is now fully operational. It will operate in collaboration with the  Special
Investigative Unit, the Director of  Public  Prosecutions,  the  Office  for
Serious Economic Offences, the Auditor-General, the SA  Police  Service  and
the national anticorruption forum. [Applause.]

Interest  rates  express  the  cost  of  capital  employed  in  the  housing
development  process  and  the  return  on  capital  investment,  either  as
development capital  or  home  loan  finance.  Accordingly,  interest  rates
influence both the price of housing and the ability of consumers to rent  or
purchase instalments. Fortunately, interest rates have declined  sharply  in
recent times, eg mortgage interest rates have declined from a peak level  of
24% per annum approximately three years ago to  a  current  level  of  about
14,5%. Comparable global rates in developed  countries  with  low  inflation
average half of that. That  is  a  situation  to  which  South  Africa  must
continue to aspire if any impact whatsoever is to be  made  on  the  housing
backlog.

In terms of what we have been doing and what we have observed,  in  relation
to financing of housing through loans and microlending, there has  not  been
enough progress. Because of that, in the year 2000 we promulgated  the  Home
Loan and Mortgage Disclosure Act to assess lending patterns. This month,  we
have published  the  sister  legislation  of  the  Home  Loan  and  Mortgage
Disclosure Act. The sister Act is now being promoted and  published  in  the
Gazette, ie the  draft  Community  Reinvestment  Bill.  We  are  asking  hon
members and the public to really give their input  to  this  Bill  prior  to
submission to Parliament.

I  would  like  to   encourage   all   role-players,   including   community
organisations, to actively participate  in  the  formulation  of  this  very
important piece of legislation which can only be of benefit  to  our  people
and the  transformation  of  the  financial  services  industry.  We  commit
ourselves to increasing choices  available  to  our  people  and  will  work
towards a system of beneficiary participation  where  most  people  who  are
assisted by  the  Government  with  their  housing  can  further  contribute
through accessing credit, or contribute savings or their  sweat  equity.  We
are actually calling upon people to stand up and do things for themselves.

Sithi: Vukuzenzele ngoba kuneletsema. [We say: Vukuzenzele because  we  have
Letsema.]

It is also important to place housing in its wider  context  as  part  of  a
strategy to develop and sustain human settlements, and  also  in  line  with
international good practice. There is much that we can learn  from.  We  can
also learn much from our experience which we can share with other  countries
in the developing world, especially Africa. As confirmed by  the  UN-Habitat
statement, the executive director considered it  important  in  her  opening
statement for Africa to acknowledge that the region is  entering  the  urban
millennium and that it will experience the highest urbanisation rate of  all
the world's regions in the coming years.

Our continued engagement in international forums,  particularly  Nepad,  has
the potential to improve the living conditions of millions of people in  our
region through raising the  profile  of  the  requirements  for  sustainable
human settlements.  Through  these  engagements,  we  can  also  enlist  the
technical and financial support which we  need  in  the  region  to  provide
basic  services  and  shelter  to  the  burgeoning  urban  masses.  This  is
demonstrated by our active involvement in the World Summit  for  Sustainable
Development process to promote human settlements and development.

Through human settlement promotion, housing is pivotal in the  link  between
the various levels of government and the various  national  departments.  In
support of the Habitat  agenda  and  the  notion  of  ``water  is  life  and
sanitation is dignity'',  Housing  will  continue  to  provide  these  basic
services through our subsidy programme.

Our aim is to achieve effective  co-ordination  between  ourselves  and  the
Departments of Provincial and Local Government; Land Affairs; Water  Affairs
and Forestry;  and  Public  Works,  as  well  as  our  counterparts  in  the
international arena, so that the benefits  of  international  fora  are  not
lost to sectoral approaches.

It is my pleasure to inform this House  that  there  is  only  one  way  for
housing, and that is to  promote  sustainable  development  to  enhance  the
subsidy increase, and to support the housing programme.

I would like to tell hon members that for as long as I  have  been  Minister
of Housing, we have been in discussion with  the  major  banks  about  their
role in developing and creating opportunities  in  the  housing  market.  We
have established no  less  than  three  housing  institutions  to  normalise
lending and establish risk management and mitigation measures.

We have,  indeed,  bent  over  backwards  to  be  responsive  to  legitimate
concerns of financial institutions. However,  home  loan  finance  is  still
insufficiently accessible. Banks in particular have failed to adjust to  the
needs of a changing housing market and  have  also  not  looked  beyond  the
appropriate traditional mortgages, as other financial service  sectors  have
done elsewhere. We have, in turn, often encountered goodwill and the  desire
to respond to the country's housing needs from within  the  banking  sector.
But the response has not swelled to the chorus of  resounding  support  that
we would have liked to hear by now.

We hope that the institution of the Community Reinvestment Act  will  assist
us to encourage the banks to move forward  and  develop  in  a  manner  that
moves away from conventional practices that are  necessarily  in  line  with
what the entire country is trying to do. We would  like  to  see  the  banks
transformed. We would like to see them put together packages that relate  to
and address the needs of the poorest of the poor on the ground.

I am looking forward to the debate in this House. [Applause.]

Mrs Z A KOTA: Chairperson, hon Minister and members  of  Parliament,  guests
from the housing industry and members of  the  department,  it  is  a  great
honour to speak on this important Budget Vote as this is  my  maiden  speech
as the chairperson of the portfolio committee. [Applause.]

Allow me to pay tribute to my predecessor, Comrade  Nomatyala  Hangana,  and
to wish her well on her new deployment as MEC  of  housing  in  the  Western
Cape. Halala, Comrade Nomatyala, halala! [Applause.] My gratitude also  goes
to the Minister of Housing, Comrade Sankie, for her continued  good  working
relationship with the committee.

We are debating this vote  with  an  understanding  that  the  Minister  has
exceeded her target in terms of housing  delivery.  On  28  April  2002  the
Sunday Times published a survey conducted by  the  SA  Advertising  Research
Foundation measuring the change in the quality of people's lives  since  the
democratic order was installed eight years ago. It says that since 1994  the
Government housing programme has yielded an increase of 1,5 million  houses.
Eight years ago, 64% of South African households owned their homes.

By this time last year, taking into account the growth in the  total  number
of homes, the number  of  homeowners  grew  to  77%.  In  rural  areas  home
ownership went from 78% to 86%, while 71% of urban dwellers own their  homes
compared with 55% in 1994.

Last year 76% of households had piped water, which is an 8% increase.  Water
delivery has improved by 85% in the rural communities. This is what the  ANC
Government has done for the people of South Africa.

Despite this progress we do know, however, that the backlog is  still  huge.
The challenge that is confronting us all as stakeholders  in  this  industry
is how to move from quantity to quality without losing momentum in terms  of
pace. Our challenge, therefore, is to ensure that the delivery of houses  is
accompanied by all relevant services in terms of infrastructure ...

... nokuba ezi zindlu zinakho na ukwenza  ukuba  oomama  babenakho  ukutyala
imifuno balime nemithi. [... and whether these housing units could  make  it
possible for women to grow vegetables and plant trees.]

We must offer  more  space  in  housing  units  for  vegetable  gardens  and
planting  of  trees,  so  that  the  building  of  houses  could  contribute
positively to poverty alleviation. [Applause.] We support  Comrade  Minister
in her call to make sure that each House has a  tree  through  ``Planting  a
Tree'', the campaign which is led by Nature. It would be  important  if  the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry could support this initiative.

The committee visited two provinces, KwaZulu-Natal and North West, in  April
and agreed to look at the question of norms and  standards  as  outlined  in
the National Housing Policy to see whether it had been adhered to.  The  aim
was to ensure that the Government gets the best product and value for  their
money in the process of housing delivery.

We wanted to see if the building of houses  was  empowering  communities  in
terms  of  job  creation  and  skills  development;  whether  the  processes
themselves were  people-driven  or  developer-driven;  and  to  what  extent
housing delivery was empowering emerging contractors. We wanted to find  out
also whether the people's housing programmes  were  taking  off  the  ground
and, if so, what the progress was.

I extend a vote  of  thanks  to  MECs  and  all  those  who  have  given  us
overwhelming support during these visits. Both provinces have  delivered  in
terms of houses. One of the findings we made  was  that  housing  is  not  a
standalone issue. Addressing the backlog needs  integration  at  all  levels
with other sectors and spheres of government, so that we avoid what  we  saw
in Ga-Rankuwa and other areas, where many houses have been built, but  where
there is no school, electricity or hospitals.

Housing cannot be promoted or  delivered  outside  the  broader  context  of
integrated service delivery. All departments need to play  their  role  with
the same impetus. We need  to  involve  them  during  the  planning  stages.
Communities need to be empowered in  terms  of  what  is  expected  of  each
project.

In one area, the developer told us that he had built a gravel road  for  the
community out of his own goodwill, but this is the requirement in  terms  of
norms and standards, as well as the national policy. It is included  in  the
subsidy. There were also people who felt that they had signed happy  letters
although they had not received  homes.  This  was  shocking  as  people  are
supposed to sign  these  happy  letters  after  getting  houses  and  having
checked that everything is okay.

It was clear  that  in  some  instances  we  were  dealing  with  the  moral
degeneration of our society, where houses were used as salons,  shops,  etc.
It was clear to us that people were not staying in  those  houses.  That  is
where the issue of involvement of all the  community  is  very  critical  to
guard against these anomalies. It is clear that these houses were  given  to
people who did not qualify.

We do know also that there are people who sell RDP houses, as  the  Minister
has just said. These are matters to be dealt with  at  community  level  and
the culprits should be brought to  book.  Our  communities  need  to  report
these people. The objective of this ANC Government is to give houses to  the
most needy, the poorest of the poor. Bad elements that divert us  from  this
goal need to be identified and the law must take its course.

Many of these issues have the bearing to the capacity  of  local  government
at the municipal level. To what extent do they have systems  that  are  able
to detect these anomalies?  Once  again,  the  Government's  first  line  of
defence is our people out there. As  long  as  we  keep  quiet  while  these
elements roam our streets, we will not do justice to our cause.

It would be incorrect if we did not share with the House our  experience  at
Kanana hostel in Klerksdorp. There are 800  people  living  in  the  hostel,
which has no ablution facilities, not  even  a  bucket  system.  The  hostel
itself does not need renovation; it needs to be demolished and rebuilt  from
scratch.

I congratulate the MEC, Darkie Africa, on acting swiftly on the  matter.  We
are awaiting the report on the progress made. This hostel is  an  indication
of the mammoth task we have at local government level during the process  of
transforming these institutions.

We must continue the  journey  to  house  our  nation  with  the  notion  of
bringing back the dignity of our people. It  is,  therefore,  critical  that
they should  be  active  participants  in  this  process,  well  armed  with
information and knowledge to make their dream a reality.  Together,  we  can
house ourselves.

Bringing services will stabilise the community and  the  people  will  start
making  their  own  investment.  This  community-based  approach  is  deemed
necessary to bring the sense of ownership, which will in  turn  enhance  the
quality of our people's lives.

One issue that has been raised by all stakeholders across the board  is  the
issue of the delay in terms of the transfer of land. This is a  matter  that
needs to be addressed, as  it  makes  it  difficult  for  beneficiaries  and
developers to access the subsidy.

In conclusion, I would like to draw the  attention  of  this  House  to  the
evictions in Khayelitsha, here at home. I visited the area  with  Mr  Doman,
the MEC for local government and my comrade, Nomatyala Hangana. We  went  to
the house of a 68-year-old pensioner, Vuyelwa Skelemani. The  sight  of  the
house inside indicated that the family was in a terrible state  of  poverty.
We also saw an elderly person who was ill and had been sick for  some  time.
This elderly person had been without water and electricity  for  two  weeks,
because she could not afford to pay rates.

Now, is this not a reversal of our gains if these poorest of  the  poor  are
sent back to the streets? I am appealing to the City of  Cape  Town  not  to
embark on blanket evictions. They need to examine each case thoroughly.  The
security and comfort of our people should  be  paramount.  Our  people  need
humane and caring policies and not evictions.

Poverty is our enemy number one. We would be able to  fight  this  enemy  if
all of us did what we are supposed to do with what is given  to  us  by  the
Government. It is about time that we move away from seeing a house  just  as
four walls and a roof, but rather as a resource or an instrument that  could
be used in fighting poverty.

We are a nation that wants to be known as a winning nation, with  a  winning
attitude. Let us pull together towards this single goal. Where  there  is  a
will, there is a way. Phambili, Minister, phambili! The  ANC  supports  this
Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Mr Chairperson, Minister,  hon  members,  rumours  have  been
flying around about the increase in the  housing  subsidy.  [Interjections.]
Yes, rumours, Ma'am, and no details! We got the details today. That is  what
the Minister announced, in case the member was not listening.  The  Minister
and her department have certainly been playing their  cards  very  close  to
their chests. But maybe the hon Botha had a little view that none of us  had
an experience of. The subsidy was supposed to take place from 1  April  this
year, but has yet to be implemented, so we are  very  pleased  to  hear  the
actual details from the Minister today.

While this increase is to be welcomed, it should be pointed  out  that  this
is the first increase in the lowest subsidy level  since  1997.  Looking  at
the effects of inflation alone, the subsidy should have been  at  least  R27
000. Does the Minister not know how the price of bread has increased in  the
last five years, never mind petrol or even building materials?

I do realise that, obviously, the bigger the housing subsidy, the fewer  the
people that can have access  to  it.  But  even  the  Minister  herself  has
admitted that we should now be going for quality instead of quantity.

As in most national departments, the development of emerging contractors  is
actively  encouraged  by  the  Department  of  Housing,  while  most  of  my
colleagues in the ruling party have a problem with contractors -  especially
big white-owned firms - making a profit. One wonders why they think  anyone,
regardless of the size of their company, would want to go into  business  if
not to make a profit? This has become increasingly difficult,  resulting  in
many builders either losing money or going bankrupt.

We all agree that the fact that the housing subsidy  beneficiaries  have  to
contribute - either financially, or by means of sweat equity - something  to
the tune of R2 439  will  give  them  a  greater  sense  of  ownership  and,
hopefully, increase the unit size and quality.  But  exactly  how  does  the
Minister  expect  people  to  save  with  the   present   high   levels   of
unemployment?

The House would like to know if there is a time limit for the savings to  be
made before the house is handed over  or  after  it  is  handed  over?  What
happens if the house is ready, but the beneficiary has not managed  to  save
their contributions yet? Will that person go to the back of the queue?

In the case of the sweat  equity  opportune,  how  will  that  component  be
incorporated into the building of a house? The Minister has also  announced,
recently, that the National Home  Builders  Registration  Council  will  now
also be responsible for inspecting low-income housing. So, what will  happen
if a house built with  sweat  equity  is  found  to  be  of  a  sub-standard
quality?

Furthermore, who will be responsible for ensuring that the finished  product
meets the minimum norms and standards? Who will train the  beneficiaries  in
building skills? Who will pay  for  the  training,  and  how  much  is  this
estimated to cost? The entire normal labour component for  building  a  unit
is almost R1 000 less than the R2  439  allocated  for  sweat  equity.  What
implications will that have for the quality and size of the house?

As regards the inspection  function  done  by  the  NHBRC,  which  will  now
include RDP housing as mentioned above, apart from ensuring  that  standards
are maintained, does the Minister believe that the NHBRC  has  the  capacity
to take on what would effectively be more  than  150  000  extra  units  per
year? This is in the light of the fact that  this  function  was  previously
outsourced and the contracts of the inspectors have not  been  renewed.  Who
has been performing this function in the meantime, and who  will  do  it  in
future? What systems and functions have been put in place by  the  NHBRC  in
order to accommodate the additional workload?

As mentioned by my colleague, the new chairperson of the  housing  portfolio
committee - and congratulations on her speech -  a  perpetual  problem  with
RDP housing is that often the people who qualify  for  these  houses  cannot
afford to live in them. Basic maintenance is  not  done,  services  are  not
paid for, and eventually  the  owners  sometimes  resort  to  selling  these
houses for a fraction of their value, sometimes for as little as R1  000  in
cash. Would the Minister like to tell  the  House  what  is  being  done  to
prevent these sales, and whether there  are  any  statistics  available  for
such activity?

The Minister herself in her speech mentioned  that  sometimes  these  houses
are used for business activities. What is done about that?

It was also noticeable,  on  the  portfolio  committee's  recent  provincial
visit,  that  very  little  attention  seems  to  be  paid  to  co-ordinated
departmental planning from  a  local  government  point  of  view.  At  each
development the  question  was  asked:  where  is  the  school,  the  police
station, the clinic, the community centre, the shops, the  taxi  rank?  This
was either answered by showing us the vacant site or vaguely  waving  in  an
unknown direction. We appeal to the Minister to make  every  effort  to  co-
ordinate  integrated  planning  with  her  colleagues  at  a  national   and
provincial level, so that when our people move into  their  new  home  other
services are also available.

One is also struck by the huge variance in size and quality  that  different
builders manage to provide from  the  previous  subsidy  regardless  of  its
limitations. Obviously, a lot depends on the topography of  the  area  where
the houses are built, but surely  there  must  be  someone  responsible  for
making sure of that? In an example that I saw recently on my  own  visit  to
Vergenoeg, Tiryville, an  extremely  poor  community  near  Uitenhage,  many
bricks had gone to the first five to eight layers  of  the  foundations  and
there were not enough to finish the top structure. The result was  that  the
houses were not finished and no one wants to take responsibility for  paying
for the additional bricks.

Another example is showers, which are not part of  the  national  norms  and
standards, but were present in all the RDP houses we  saw  in  KwaZulu-Natal
and not in the North West.  How  is  it  possible  for  contractors  in  one
province to make provision for such a basic and inexpensive  necessity,  but
not in other provinces? Again, why are  some  houses  provided  with  trees,
which we welcome, but not the others?

And perhaps most of all, it would take so little effort to  make  Government
housing more attractive. Why is it that contractors cannot be  persuaded  to
put every 10th house, for example, at a different angle to the rest? Why  do
all the doors and windows have to face the same  way?  I  am  sure  if  Mark
Shuttleworth could see South Africa from his rocket, he would  have  spotted
RDP houses immediately. I plead with the Minister that we make  some  effort
to  deinstitutionalise  these  developments  and  make  them  more   people-
friendly.

A further example of really good houses that we saw - and perhaps  the  best
- was those houses built under the PHP process. They  definitely  proved  to
be of the best quality. They are larger  in  size  and  there  was  lots  of
community involvement. While  the  general  complaint  about  this  type  of
housing seems to be that it is much slower than contract  housing,  I  would
submit that this is the way to go. We are going to support the principle  of
having quality rather than quantity. I would suggest that this  be  the  way
that the Department of Housing should go. [Applause.]

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Chairperson, the hon Minister  of  Housing,  hon  members,
and our new Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Housing,  Comrade  Zoe
Kota, on the occasion of his address to Habitat  for  Humanity  in  Oukasie,
Brits, on 10 August 2001, the President, Mr Thabo Mbeki said, and I quote:
  You will find among South Africans a dedicated army of workers  that  has
  laboured tirelessly for the past seven years to  house  millions  of  our
  people, thus contributing, in their  own  humble  way,  to  the  improved
  living conditions of these people.

He further said:


  This dedicated team of women and men has ensured that we deliver  to  all
  our people and the country more than 1 million houses in a space  of  six
  years, and in the process providing many  millions  of  our  people  with
  shelter.

Having said that, let us remind ourselves that we have proclaimed this  year
the Year  of  the  Volunteer  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  of  our
Country.

It is a touching experience to watch the same women  and  men  of  whom  the
President spoke, the People's Housing Process, draw their own plans,  design
their own houses to scale, build  their  own  cardboard  models,  contribute
their own money and build their own houses.

We wish to thank the Minister of Housing, Comrade  Sankie,  for  recognising
this bold act of voluntarism years ago, and  providing  funding  to  sustain
this initiative. The Minister of Finance, Comrade  Trevor  Manuel,  outlined
to us the various figures of growth of our  economy.  The  figures  were  as
follows:

In the year 2000, the economic growth was 3,8%;  the  2001  economic  growth
was 2,2%; and, the current growth is expected to  reach  2,3%.  Despite  the
setback of slow economic growth this year, the national Housing  budget  has
been increased by 12%. The figure for the year  2001-02  was  R3,3  billion,
while this year's figure has increased and stands at R3,7 billion.

We  welcome  this  increase  and  support  the  formula  of  allocation   to
provinces.  This  allocation  formula  actually  considered  the   following
points: Firstly, the existing housing backlog measured  through  the  number
of informal dwellings per province; Secondly, the relative  poverty  figures
in each province, of household earnings less than  R3,500  per  month;  and,
last but not least, the size of the population in each province. These  form
the yardstick that has been used to gauge the allocation to the provinces.

Let us take our hats off to some of our Housing MECs because  they  did  not
have any roll-overs in the past two years. [Applause.] All allocations  have
been converted into houses on the ground.

More good news on the housing front comes in the form of  the  increment  in
the housing subsidy scheme to R20 000  per  household  from  R17  000.  This
will, fortunately, address the question of the rising inflation rate,  which
currently stands at 6,9%, from 6,6% in the year  2001.  We  trust  that  the
increase in the subsidy will absorb whatever level of price  increment  will
occur as a result of the current rise in inflation.

The current housing standard of 32m2 has been called  names.  To  those  who
continue to do so we say: Pause and reflect on the past. For example, I  was
born in a township called Alexandra many years  ago.  The  political  system
and philosophy of the then ruling  party  was  to  forcibly  separate  South
African citizens along racial lines in  order  to  break  their  resolve  to
fight back, courtesy of the Group Areas Act.

When I was eight years old we were removed from  that  township  to  another
one called Diepkloof in Soweto. Furniture, toys, cats, mice,  broken  hearts
and tears were whisked away to an unknown destination,  on  the  back  of  a
municipality truck. That is the experience that launched into  the  township
full of rows of houses, most of them 42m2.

We paid rent and service charges in that council house for 30  years.  After
the new democracy was born, there were  no  longer  pain  and  tears  to  be
associated with our small 32m2 houses. We concede we must  improve,  and  we
will improve. But, at the same time we should consider  the  fact  that  the
people who have occupied  the  32m2  houses  have  got  free  leasehold  and
ownership of the house, and there is no place like  home.  Contractors,  for
instance, who do not follow the specifications when building  and  providing
housing for our people obviously have to be  followed  up  by  the  National
Home Builders Registration Council.

When we proclaim that there shall be housing, security and comfort for  all,
we acknowledge, at the same  time,  the  current  obstacles.  But  we  shall
strive to implement this key clause of the Freedom Charter. [Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  the  Director-
General and her team, listening to the state of  the  nation  address  on  8
February this year, I was struck by His  Excellency,  the  President's  call
for a volunteers' programme of ``Vukuzenzele.'' This was music to  my  ears,
because the IFP has for all its years of existence espoused  the  philosophy
of self-help and self-reliance. Because of  the  IFP's  vision  and  insight
into the real issues facing communities on the ground, it was  easy  for  us
to  realise  that  without  the  contribution  and  direct  involvement   of
communities in the improvement of their own lives, there  was  no  way  that
success could be achieved in addressing the challenges they face.

For example, during the time when our leader, the hon Prince M G  Buthelezi,
was involved in the erstwhile  KwaZulu  government,  as  instructed  by  the
founding fathers of our liberation struggle, he  encouraged  communities  to
embark on programmes such as ``Rand for a Rand'', through which  communities
were able to galvanise financial resources in order to  build,  among  other
things, schools for the education of their children. The  IFP  welcomes  the
call and takes the challenge because we regard it  as  an  articulation  and
implementation of our philosophy of self-help and self-reliance.

However, before I am mistaken for an aspirant leader of the opposition,  let
me get to the business of the day. It is our belief that the  Department  of
Housing's programmes are in line with the overall goals of  the  Government,
of which we are  part.  They  promote  the  spirit  and  objectives  of  our
country's Constitution, and we, therefore, support them.

However, there are certain issues that we would like to highlight and  would
like the department to look at. Firstly, the IFP's  vision  for  housing  is
the one in  terms  of  which  there  is  rapid  and  efficient  delivery  of
essential services to the poorest of  the  poor  in  both  urban  and  rural
areas.

We believe in helping people house themselves by empowering  communities  to
make informed decisions regarding prioritisation of housing needs, based  on
the  best  use  of  available  resources;  the   affordability   of   family
households; the appropriateness of the level of  services;  access  to  bond
finance; the proximity to economic  opportunities;  and  the  durability  of
building material used.

The IFP welcomes the department's shift from quantity  to  quality.  And  in
the spirit of Vukuzenzele and the IFP's philosophy of  self-help  and  self-
reliance, the People's Housing  Process  is  supported.  Not  only  does  it
respond directly to the President's call for people to  start  doing  things
for themselves, but also bring to fruition what we have always stated,  that
people should be directly involved in their development and  must  be  given
the opportunity to decide on  the  kind  of  development  they  require.  We
believe that this programme, if made the core of all the programmes  of  the
department, will go a long way  towards  producing  better  quality  houses,
which will also be affordable.

It has been proven that when people are involved and do  things  themselves,
they become committed to safeguarding and taking good care of  the  products
brought about by the developmental process.  Communities  must  be  afforded
the opportunity to decide for themselves the nature  and  the  form  of  the
structures they would like to erect when constructing their houses.

Secondly, it is our observation that the majority of houses that  have  been
built are on municipal land, with their own property rating  policies  taken
together with service delivery charges decided at  that  level.  It  is  our
belief that the majority of communities which  are  beneficiaries  of  these
houses are at the  lowest  economic  level.  We  are  concerned  that  these
houses, which are aimed at contributing towards the eradication of  poverty,
might in turn become poverty traps due  to  the  failure  and  inability  of
communities to pay rates and for services. But we welcome  the  department's
initiative to encourage our communities to develop savings schemes. We  also
urge other departments to get involved in creating sustainable job  creation
projects in these housing projects. This is possible because our people  are
willing - it is not that they are so poor that  they  cannot  afford  it.  I
have heard one speaker saying that they cannot  afford  this.  Slogans  like
``Amandla awethu!'' [power is ours!] have been replaced by  ``Amandla  imali
nolwazi'' [power is money and knowledge]. [Applause.]

Thirdly, we welcome the department's shift from a  bias  towards  developing
urban areas while neglecting, to a large extent, the  development  of  rural
areas. This created an anomaly in that all  the  people,  whether  they  are
rural  or  urban  based,  deserve  the  same  treatment  in  terms  of   our
Constitution. However, it is important to point out that these  communities,
rural and urban, are not homogeneous.  Therefore  approaches  towards  their
development cannot be the same. Their development has to happen and must  do
so in a sustainable manner.

(Translation of Sotho paragraph follows.)
[Hon Minister, I am very delighted to hear you talking about hostels.  There
is a complaint here  regarding  hostels  and  houses  in  Dobsonville,  Bram
Fischer and Meadowlands, for example. However, there are  5  000  houses  in
Bram Fischer, which only took the department two and a half years to  build.
But a look at the Meadowlands hostel shows that there are 3 500 places,  but
it took the department about four years to  complete.  I  think  that  I  am
personally pleased by your words that they should embark  on  special  trips
to go and take care of that matter. Oh yes, sir, I  can  express  myself  in
that language, because I am a township boy. [Laughter.]]

There is a misconception  that  all  IFP  members  are  from  KwaZulu-Natal.
Finally, I want to quote the Prince of KwaPhindangene, the Minister of  Home
Affairs, when he spoke in the state of the  nation  address.  He  stated  as
follows:


  I cannot be satisfied with what we have achieved, great  as  it  is,  and
  must wonder whether, in addition to the many right things we have done as
  Government, we have not erred in other respects. After  all,  to  err  is
  human.

As the IFP we believe that the department has  taken  a  good  step  in  the
right direction and therefore support the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Chairperson, Minister and  members,  I  welcome  our
new chairperson Zoe Kota, after we worked so well with  our  ex-chairperson,
Nomatyala Hangana. She will get all our support; she can ask the Minister!

One can ask who is Servcon? And where is Servcon? I just want  to  sketch  a
small picture here. Servcon was launched in 1995 to 1997  in  terms  of  the
1994 record of understanding at the Botshabelo Housing Conference.

In 1998 het ons die tydperk verleng, en so ook die mandaat vir die  volgende
agt  jaar,  sodat  dit  alle  bankeiendomme,  asook  die   wanbetaling   van
verbandhouers, kan  afhandel.  Die  ooreenkoms  was  dat  alle  ooreenkomste
tussen die banke en die eienaars binne die tydperk  van  twee  jaar  opgelos
moes word, maar in 1998 het ons dit verder  verleng  met  die  ondertekening
van 'n notule van ooreenkoms. Hierdie ooreenkoms het verder plek gemaak  vir
mense wat nog nie met Servcon onderhandel het nie.

Dit is waar die misverstand  ontstaan  het  onder  die  eienaars  en  sekere
leiers. Daar is van ons leiers in hierdie Huis wat maak asof hulle nie  weet
dat Servcon bestaan nie. Daar is  leiers  in  hierdie  Huis  wat  die  mense
mislei, wat nie die mense die regte antwoorde gee nie. Ons minister  comrade
Sankie Mthembi se deur staan altyd oop. As agb lede iets nie weet  nie,  kan
hulle haar gerus bel. Hulle sal die antwoorde kry oor  waar  Servcon  is  en
hoe Servcon werk.

Daar was nie genoeg  terugvoering  en  inligting  oor  die  keuses  wat  die
eienaars kon maak nie. Daar was nie huise  beskikbaar  vir  regskaling  nie.
Hierdie mense het nie die waarde besef van wat Servcon hulle  aangebied  het
nie, deurdat hulle 'n minimum van R70 per maand  kon  betaal  om  hulle  eie
huis te huur - wanneer 'n mens kyk na gewone paaiemente van R2 500,  is  R70
per maand baie min - met 'n jaarlikse verhoging van minstens R20  per  maand
oor  'n  tydperk  van  drie  tot  vier  jaar  as  hulle  die   herkoop-   of
leningsveranderingsopsie sou kies. Hierdie opsies het ons mense  nie  gevolg
nie, en ek praat nie net van swartmense nie, maar deur die bank van  wit  en
swart.

Die regskaling was bedoel  vir  gevalle  waarin  die  eienaar  'n  huis  kon
identifiseer wat voldoen het aan die subsidievereistes, en dan  sou  Servcon
dit vir hulle koop met die subsidiegeld, maar die  probleem  wat  ons  mense
het, is ons tradisie. Ek woon byvoorbeeld 10 jaar lank in  my  huis,  en  ek
gaan nie trek nie, of ek is  dalk  gewoond  aan  'n  buitensporig  groot  en
gerieflike huis, en ek sien nie kans om onder te begin met  'n  viervertrek-
huis nie. Dit is wat ek  in  die  Matjabeng-Letjweleputswa-streek  ondervind
het.

Ander mense het geweier om een van bogenoemde voorvereistes na  te  kom,  en
sodoende het daar regstappe teen hulle gevolg. Die  ander  gevalle  is  waar
die oorspronklike eienaars nie meer in die  huis  woon  nie,  maar  dit  aan
iemand anders verhuur en sodoende nie vir die lening betaal  nie.  Hier  het
Servcon dan die inwoner die kans gegee om die huis direk  te  huur  met  die
opsie om te koop. Dit wou die huurder ook  nie  doen  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In 1998 we extended the period, and also the mandate  for  the  next  eight
years, so that it could finalise all bank properties and defaulting by  bond
holders. The agreement was that all agreements between  the  banks  and  the
owners had to be resolved within two years, but in 1998 we further  extended
it  by  signing  a  minute  of   agreement.   This   agreement   furthermore
accommodated people who had not yet negotiated with Servcon.

This is where the  misunderstanding  arose  among  the  owners  and  certain
leaders. There are some of our leaders in this  House  who  pretend  not  to
know about Servcon's existence. There are leaders in this House who  mislead
the people, who do not give people  the  right  answers.  The  door  of  our
Minister Comrade Sankie Mthembi is always open. If hon members do  not  know
something, they are welcome to call her. They will get  the  answers  as  to
where Servcon is and how Servcon works.

There was inadequate feedback and information about the choices that  owners
could exercise. There were  no  houses  available  for  purposes  of  right-
sizing. These people did not realise the value of what Servcon was  offering
them in that they could pay a minimum of R70 per month  to  rent  their  own
house - when one looks at ordinary payments of R2 500, then  R70  per  month
is very little - with an annual increase of at least R20 per  month  over  a
period of three to four years if they were to choose the re-purchase  option
or the changed loan option. These options our people did not utilise, and  I
am not talking only of black people, but of everyone, white and black.

The right-sizing was intended for cases in which the owner could identify  a
house complying with the subsidy requirements, and then Servcon  would  have
bought it for them with the money from the subsidy,  but  the  problem  with
our people is our tradition. I, for example, have been living  in  my  house
for 10 years, and  I  am  not  going  to  move,  or  perhaps  I  have  grown
accustomed to living in an exceptionally large and comfortable house, and  I
do not see my way clear to starting at the bottom with a four-roomed  house.
This is what I found in Matjabeng-Letjweleputswa Region.

Others refused to comply with either of the  aforementioned  pre-requisites,
and in so doing legal steps were taken against them.  The  other  cases  are
where the original owners are  no  longer  living  in  the  house,  but  are
renting it to someone else and therefore do not pay the loan.  Here  Servcon
gave the inhabitant the chance to hire the house directly  with  the  option
of purchasing it. This the person renting the  house  did  not  want  to  do
either.]

It seems as though our people do not  want  to  improve  their  standard  of
living because they listen to  wrong  leaders  who  misinform  them  at  all
times, at all costs. As the ANC Government we  do  not  just  implement  the
laws  and  legislation.  Thorough  discussions  and  negotiations  with  all
stakeholders took place for a  period  of  more  than  three  years,  before
agreeing to  all  the  various  options.  All  the  stakeholders,  like  the
tripartite alliance and Sanco, agreed to these options. I  want  to  repeat,
all stakeholders, the tripartite plus Sanco, agreed to these  options.  This
is because we do not want to see a moral degeneration of our  nation.  Black
and white South Africans, here is a chance to have a house, even  if  it  is
smaller than  what  one  obtained  whilst  employed  or  when  one  is  more
financially secure. The time is passing, get on the train.

Unemployment and poverty also play a major role, but  Servcon  has  come  up
with yet another programme of poverty alleviation. This  entails  gardening,
cleaning services for our communities, bakeries and  crèches,  so  that  the
owners of the houses could improve their lives and  also  pay  for  services
rendered  by  the  council.  The  other  problem  is  a  lack  of  financial
management. Instead of paying the rent and  for  services,  our  people  are
spending the money elsewhere. This culture of nonpayment must be reversed.

The second housing institution is  in  Ithubelisha.  This  is  part  of  the
department and Servcon's plan to ensure that there  are  houses  for  people
when relocation and rightsizing are exercised. This is the best, but do  our
people want to make  use  of  this  programme?  No,  they  are  moving  back
illegally, as in my previous analysis.  Yet,  whilst  Thubelisha  takes  the
people from the Servcon portfolio, they will receive serviced houses with  a
clearance certificate removing their names  from  the  ITC,  and  they  will
become the lawful owners of these houses. If this is  not  acceptable,  then
what is?

Die ander probleem is die verdwyning van die meeste vrouens se mans. Dit  is
'n aspek wat dringend aandag moet kry, omrede dié vroue wat agtergelaat  is,
nie kan kwalifiseer vir hervestiging nie. Hierdie  probleem  is  net  so  'n
groot kopseer vir kindertoelae. Die mans van vandag hardloop weg  van  hulle
verantwoordelikhede en gaan produseer nog ekstra kinders by ander vrouens.
Die rede waarom ek hieroor praat,  is  omdat  sommige  vrouens  ook  net  so
skuldig is. Hierdie vrouens gee voor dat hulle mans die hasepad gekies  het,
maar dan werk die mans in die naburige dorpe en stede  en  stuur  geld  huis
toe. Hierdie is 'n sosiale mentaliteit  omdat  hulle  dan  van  beide  kante
voordeel trek, deur van die  Regering  hulp  te  kry  en  steeds  finansiële
ondersteuning van hul mans te ontvang. Daar is uitsonderings, maar wat  doen
'n mens in die geval waar hierdie tipe bedrog gepleeg word? Wat sê die  wet?


Ons kry nou weer 'n nuwe behuisingsinstansie met  die  naam  Social  Housing
Foundation. Hierdie instansie sal verseker  dat  ons  mense  se  lot  verlig
word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The other problem is the disappearance of  the  husbands  of  most  of  the
women. This is an aspect that urgently  requires  attention,  because  these
women who are left behind do not qualify for  relocation.  This  problem  is
just as big a headache in respect of child grants.  The  men  of  today  run
away from their  responsibilities  and  produce  more  children  with  other
women.

The reason that I am talking about this is because some women  are  just  as
guilty. These women pretend that their husbands have left them, but  in  the
meantime the men are working in neighbouring towns and  cities  and  sending
money home. This is a social mentality, because they benefit from both  ends
by receiving assistance from the Government while also  receiving  financial
support from their husbands. There are exceptions, but what does one  do  in
the case where this kind of fraud is committed? What does the law say?

We are now once again getting a new housing institution  called  the  Social
Housing Foundation. This institution will ensure relief for  the  plight  of
our people.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Knowledge and ``mali''. We do not want  lazy  people
here. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Mnr die Voorsitter, dit is tradisie in hierdie  Huis  dat
wanneer iemand sy of haar nuwelingstoespraak  maak,  hy  nie  kontroversieël
gaan optree nie - en ek beloof om by daardie tradisie te hou.

Dit skyn of die Minister en ek oor weinig verskil.  Ek  wil  haar  gelukwens
met  'n  goeie  begrotingstoespraak,  veral  waar  sy   klem   lê   op   die
kwantitatiewe aspek dat ons nou, nadat die 1,325 miljoen huise  voltooi  is,
vir  beter   kwaliteit   sal   gaan.   Die   groot   gros   mense   in   die
middelinkomstegroep, wat oor die laaste ag jaar byna nie aandag  geniet  het
nie, gaan nou aandag kry.

Ons is natuurlik almal dankbaar vir die verhoging in die subsidies.  Dit  is
lank reeds nodig dat die subsidies aangepas word, as in gedagte  gehou  word
dat die materiaalpryse reeds vanjaar met 45% gestyg het. Aan die ander  kant
wil ek graag hê die Minister moet vir ons absolute duidelikheid gee oor  wat
presies die posisie gaan wees met betrekking tot provinsies  soos  die  Wes-
Kaap,  Gauteng  en  KwaZulu-Natal,  wat  in  die  verlede  as   gevolg   van
geotegniese omstandighede 'n addisionele aanvulling  van  15%  ontvang  het.
Gaan dit steeds die geval wees met die verhoogde subsidie  om  hierdie  drie
provinsies in dieselfde posisie te plaas as die res van die land?

Iets wat daadwerklik aandag  moet  geniet,  is  weer  eens  die  opstel  van
waglyste. Dit is ondenkbaar dat ons, wanneer daar 'n verkiesing is, vir  die
hele land kieserslyste kan opstel, maar by die plaaslike  owerhede  is  daar
skielik geen kapasiteit om waglyste op te stel nie.  As  ons  daardie  euwel
kan uitroei, en seker kan maak dat mense  registreer  by  behuisingskantore,
is dit nie nodig dat mense moet kom en kla dat hulle  vir  die  laaste  twee
jaar wag vir 'n huis nie.

As hulle ongelukkig voel, kan agb lede hulle indink hoe die mense moet  voel
wat die afgelope 15 tot 20 jaar reeds wag vir wonings.  Wat  ook  verblydend
is, is die Minister se ferm houding met  betrekking  tot  die  kontantbydrae
wat mense moet maak. Dit op sigself sal verhoed  dat  mense  nie  so  maklik
meer van hul gratis wonings ontslae raak nie en dat hulle sal besef dat  dit
hul enigste en grootste belegging ooit sal wees.

Ietwat onduidelik en waarop ons graag antwoorde sal  wil  kry,  is  dat  dit
volgens die Minister op 1 April in werking  tree.  Daarmee  het  ek  nie  'n
probleem nie. Die vraag is egter: As ons dit nou  rigied  gaan  toepas  soos
dit moet, sal dit nie in die toekoms  die  behuisingsleweringsproses  ietwat
vertraag nie? Want deur R100 per maand te spaar, sal dit  iemand  24  maande
neem om die R2 479 te spaar. Ons sal in gesprek  moet  tree,  sodat  ons  'n
voortdurende vloei van behuisingslewering  kan  aanspreek  en  'n  meganisme
vind hoe om daar verby te kom.

Wat egter die heel interessantste en opwindendste  is  in  die  Minister  se
toespraak, is dat die Kabinet in Desember verlede jaar  'n  addisionele  R27
000 per verbruiker goedgekeur het,  bo  en  behalwe  die  R18  000  wat  die
normale subsidie sal wees.

Dit bring my by iets waaroor ek  redelik  opgewonde  is,  want  hoe  is  dit
moontlik dat ons in die ware sin van die woord kan begin met  institusionele
behuising? Bitter min mense is bewus  daarvan  en  ek  wil  met  die  vorige
spreker  heelhartig  saamstem  dat  die  groot  probleem  in  behuising  die
waninformasie is wat na buite gaan, wat mense verwar  en  verwagtinge  skep.
Ons praat van geïnstitusionaliseerde behuising en ons moet  dan  onmiddellik
vir  mekaar  sê,  dit  is  gemik  op  mense  wat  nie  kwalifiseer  vir  die
maksimumsubsidie as gevolg van die inkomstegroep waarin  hulle  val  en  wat
andersins ook nie kwalifiseer vir verbande by banke  nie.  Dit  sal  hierdie
mense in staat stel om 'n dak oor hul koppe te kry. Die  mooiste  van  alles
is dat in veral die groter stede waar behuisingsgrond redelik  skaars  begin
raak, dit  ons  in  die  posisie  sal  stel  om  beskikbare  behuisingsgrond
optimaal te benut.

Die ander groot voordeel van institusionele behuising, is natuurlik dat  die
betaling van  belasting  en  dienstegelde  daardeur  gewaarborg  word.  Baie
opwindend is dat dit  welvaart  en  werksgeleenthede  skep  vir  mense.  Die
maksimale benutting van die privaatsektor se bydrae kan hierdeur  ook  bydra
dat werkgewers en veral ook vakbonde hul bydrae lewer  om  mense  van  beter
huisvesting te voorsien.

Laaste maar  nie  die  minste  nie,  is  die  heel  opwindendste  binne  die
institusionele behuising: Die geleentheid word geskep dat  huiseienaars  die
nodige opleiding kry om hul volle  verantwoordelikheid  as  huiseienaars  te
aanvaar en te besef dat hulle eienaars is  en  self  na  hul  instandhouding
moet omsien.

As ons na institusionele behuising kyk - en ek weet die Minister is ook  ten
gunste  daarvan  -  het  ons   twee   kategorieë,   naamlik   institusionele
huureenhede, of soos die mense in die Engelse sleng dit stel, ``stay for  as
long as you pay''. Dit gee vir mense wie se omstandighede  verbeter  en  wat
verkies om nie in daardie addisionele wonings te woon nie,  die  geleentheid
om dertig dae kennis te gee en te gaan en te trek waarheen hulle verkies.

'n  Tweede  aspek  wat  ook  vir  ons  noodsaaklik  is,  is  natuurlik   die
paaiementverkoopsbenadering, of ``instalment sales  approach''.  Hierdie  is
'n opwindende nuwe konsep  binne  die  institusionele  behuising,  waar  die
verbruiker - en ek hou van die Minister se nuwe  uitdrukking  van  ``housing
consumers'' - by die verkoopskema inskakel, hy of sy  vir  die  eerste  vier
jaar 'n vaste paaiement betaal, wat op sigself weer  die  voordeel  het  dat
mense  leer  om  finansieel  hul  eie  sake  beter  te  bestuur.   Wat   die
wonderlikste van alles is, is dat ná vier jaar hierdie mense  bewys  gelewer
het  aan  finansiële  instellings  en  aan  ander   instansies   dat   hulle
kredietwaardig is en 'n goeie kredietrekord opgebou het.

Die een  aspek  waaraan  ons  vinnig  aandag  sal  moet  gee,  is  die  snel
verstedeliking en dat ons dan sal kyk na minder formele vestiging, waar  ons
in situ opgradering oor 'n tydperk van drie jaar  kan  laat  plaasvind.  Dit
sal dan die geleentheid gee dat ons die beskikbare subsidies oor 'n  tydperk
soos en met die MTEF kan rek  en  sodoende  meer  mense  van  behuising  kan
voorsien. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Mr Chairperson, it is a  tradition  in  this  House  that
when someone makes his or her maiden speech they do not act  controversially
- and I promise to keep to that tradition.

It appears that the Minister and  I  do  not  differ  on  much.  I  want  to
congratulate her on a good speech, particularly  where  she  emphasised  the
quantitive aspect that now after the 1, 325 million  houses  are  completed,
we will aim for better quality. The average man in the street in the middle-
income group, who has had virtually no attention over the past eight  years,
will now receive attention.

Of course we are all grateful for the increase in the subsidies. For a  long
time it has already been necessary for the subsidies to be adjusted, if  one
bears in mind that the cost of materials  has  already  risen  by  45%  this
year. On the other hand, I would like  the  Minister  to  give  us  absolute
clarity about precisely what the position will be with regard  to  provinces
like the  Western  Cape,  Gauteng  and  KwaZulu-Natal,  which  in  the  past
received an additional  supplement  of  15%  as  a  result  of  geotechnical
circumstances. Will it still be the  case  with  the  increased  subsidy  to
place these three provinces  in  the  same  position  as  the  rest  of  the
country?

Something which must receive decisive attention is, once again, the  drawing
up of waiting lists. It is unthinkable that, when there is an  election,  we
can draft voters' rolls for the entire country, but  there  is  suddenly  no
capacity in the local authorities to  draw  up  waiting  lists.  If  we  can
eradicate that evil, and make sure that people register at housing  offices,
it will not be necessary for people to come  and  complain  that  they  have
been waiting for a house for the past two years.

If they feel unhappy, one can imagine how the  people  must  feel  who  have
already been waiting for dwellings for the past 15  to  20  years.  What  is
also heartening is the Minister's firm attitude  with  regard  to  the  cash
contribution which people have to make. This in itself will  prevent  people
getting rid of their free dwellings so quickly and they  will  realise  that
this will be their biggest and only investment ever.

Something which is somewhat unclear and to which we would  like  to  receive
answers, is that according to the Minister this comes into  operation  on  1
April. I do not have a problem with that. However, the question  is:  If  we
are now going to apply this rigidly, as should be the case,  will  this  not
delay the housing delivery  process  somewhat  in  the  future?  Because  by
saving R100 per month, it would take someone 24 months to save the  R2  479.
We will have to have discussions, so that we can address a constant flow  of
housing delivery and find a mechanism to get past that.

However, what is most  interesting  and  most  exciting  in  the  Minister's
speech, is that in December last year the  Cabinet  approved  an  additional
R27 000 per consumer, above and beyond the R18 000 which will be the  normal
subsidy.

This brings me to something which I am fairly excited about, because how  is
it possible for us to be able to begin with  institutional  housing  in  the
true sense of the word? Very few people are aware of this and I  would  like
to agree wholeheartedly with the previous speaker that the  big  problem  in
housing is the misinformation which goes out there and confuses  people  and
creates expectations. We are talking about institutionalised housing and  we
must then immediately say to one another that it is aimed at people  who  do
not qualify for the maximum subsidy as a  result  of  the  income  group  in
which they fall and who otherwise also do not qualify for  bonds  at  banks.
It will enable these people to have a roof over their heads.  Best  of  all,
particularly in the bigger cities where land  for  housing  is  starting  to
become fairly scarce, is that it puts us in a position to utilise  available
housing land optimally.

The other big advantage of institutional housing is,  of  course,  that  the
payment of tax and service fees is guaranteed in  this  way.  What  is  very
exciting is that it creates prosperity and  job  opportunities  for  people.
The maximum utilisation of the private sector's  contribution  can  in  this
way also contribute to employers and particularly trade unions making  their
contribution to providing people with better housing.

Last but not  least,  is  the  most  exciting  aspect  within  institutional
housing:  The  opportunity  is  created  for  home  owners  to  receive  the
necessary training to accept their full responsibility as  home  owners  and
to realise that they are owners and must see to maintenance themselves.

If we look at institutional housing - and I know that the Minister  is  also
in favour of this - we have  two  categories,  namely  institutional  rental
units, or as people put it in English slang, stay for as long  as  you  pay.
This offers people whose circumstances improve and who prefer  not  to  live
in those additional dwellings the opportunity to give  thirty  days'  notice
and to move to where they prefer to be.

A second aspect which is also essential to us, is of course  the  instalment
sales approach.  This  is  an  exciting  new  concept  within  institutional
housing in which the consumer - and I like the Minister's new expression  of
``housing consumers'' - joins the sales scheme and pays a  fixed  instalment
for the first four years, which in itself has the benefit that people  learn
to manage their own financial affairs better. What is  wonderful  about  all
this is that  after  four  years  these  people  have  proven  to  financial
institutions and other institutions that  they  are  creditworthy  and  have
built up a good credit record.

The one aspect that we will have to give attention to very  shortly  is  the
rapid urbanisation and we will then look at less  formal  settlement,  where
we can allow in situ upgrading to take place over a period of  three  years.
This will then give us the opportunity to be able to stretch  the  available
subsidies over a period such as and with the MTEF and in  this  way  provide
more people with housing. [Applause.]]

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN: Chairperson, Comrade Minister, comrades and  hon  members,
may I first take this opportunity to congratulate the hon Herandien  on  his
maiden speech. Congratulations!

Throughout the ages  humankind  has  sought  to  house  itself  in  adequate
shelter, which shelter would protect them from the elements, keep them  warm
in winter and cool in summer; adequate shelter which  would  maintain  their
human dignity and pride.

The housing delivery programme of the ANC-led Government has achieved  this.
Adequate shelter has  been  provided  to  over  1,3  million  beneficiaries,
providing  protection  from  the  elements,  giving  warmth  in  winter  and
providing shade in summer.

Each person, whether young or  old,  who  has  benefited  from  the  housing
delivery programme has had their human dignity restored and can  again  feel
proud of the home which they live in.

According to recent findings of the  SA  Advertising  Research  Foundation's
All Media & Product Survey, the lives  of  most  South  Africans  have  been
steadily improving since the 1994 elections, due mainly to the  delivery  of
basic services by Government of water, sanitation and electricity.

The survey also indicates that in 1994, 64% of South  Africans  owned  their
own homes, and that this had increased to 77% in 2001. According to  leading
economists ... [Interjections] ...  Standard  Bank,  the  findings  indicate
that Government has been doing its job. Let me  repeat  that:  The  findings
indicate that Government has been doing its job  -  I  direct  this  to  hon
Semple.

Recently  the  Minister  of  Housing,   Comrade   Sankie   Mthembi-Mahanyele
announced a change in the subsidy scheme. There are three main changes.
Firstly, the subsidy increases to R20 300. Secondly, beneficiaries would  be
required to contribute an amount of R2 479  through  savings  schemes  which
would be added to the new subsidy amount. However, this does  not  apply  to
old-age pensioners,  the  differently  abled  and  the  indigent,  who  will
receive the full subsidy. Thirdly, those who are not able to save  would  be
required to participate in the construction of their new homes  through  the
People's Housing Process.

We are moving away from the beneficiary system in which people sit back  and
wait for Government to deliver to a participatory  system  in  which  people
actively participate and  work  with  Government  in  the  housing  delivery
programme. The contribution of R2 479  will  go  towards  increased  quality
standards, such as an increase in the overhang of the roof.

An exciting new development is that the National  Home  Builders  Regulatory
Council will now inspect each subsidy home before it is  accepted  from  the
builder. The inspection will be focused on the quality construction  of  the
house. This will ensure  that  a  high  level  of  quality  construction  is
attained and maintained.

In this regard I would like  to  propose  that  when  the  NHBRC  inspectors
inspect the house that they also  inspect  the  house  to  ensure  that  the
minimum standards as laid down in the housing  code  had  been  adhered  to.
This will ensure that all required standards are  met  and  that  developers
and builders do not build substandard homes.

We expect developers and contractors to deliver nothing but the  very  best,
a product that is of the highest quality and standard. The message we  bring
to developers and contractors is  that  they  should  not  see  the  housing
delivery  programme  as  a  means  of  self-enrichment.  They  need  to  see
themselves as playing a role that will enrich the lives of  those  for  whom
they are building new homes.

A national savings scheme is to  be  developed  and  promoted  to  encourage
people to start saving on a monthly basis towards the building of their  new
homes.  Some  banking  institutions  have  indicated  their  willingness  to
participate. But there is a need for all banking institutions  to  recognise
the power of the poor. They need to recognise that the  poor  are  a  market
that needs to be invested in and serviced.

The poor of the world are able to save, and they do save. The  poor  of  the
world are able to service their laon repayments, and they do.  We  therefore
call on the banking institutions in South Africa to reach out  to  the  poor
of our  land,  and  to  make  their  services  easily  accessible  and  more
affordable.

The People's Housing Process, or  PHP,  is  in  my  mind  one  of  the  most
exciting aspects of the housing delivery programme. The Minister of  Housing
has announced that 10% of the housing budget would be allocated to  the  PHP
in future. The PHP sees communities coming  together  in  helping  to  build
their own homes. They are trained on how to build and are  assisted  through
the entire process.

The final product that is achieved provides homes that are  bigger  and,  in
many instances, of  a  higher  standard  of  quality  than  those  built  by
developers. The PHP saves on  labour  costs  and  building  material  costs.
Often second-hand building material, such as window frames  and  doorframes,
are used.

During the past three years the housing portfolio committee has visited  all
nine provinces, and, for me personally,  the  highlight  of  each  of  those
visits has been the people's housing projects which we have visited. I  have
seen homes of up to 80m2  being  built  using  the  current  subsidy  amount
before the increase that has been announced ... [Applause] ...  homes  which
consist of two to three bedrooms, a lounge-cum-dining room, a kitchen and  a
bathroom.

The  PHP  captures  the  spirit  of  Letsema;  it  captures  the  spirit  of
voluntarism. I would like to echo a call that I made in  this  House  during
last year's Budget Vote, calling upon all South  Africans  to  get  involved
and help: the PHP provides this very opportunity. One does not have to be  a
builder, but one can push a wheelbarrow, pass bricks, mix cement  and  paint
a house. [Applause.]

I would like to suggest to the hon Minister  that  when  a  PHP  project  is
started in an area, an invitation should  be  sent  out  to  church  groups,
religious institutions, youth groups and business  chambers,  among  others,
inviting them to come and help and actively participate in the  construction
of a better country and a better world. The PHP  gives  each  South  African
the opportunity to  lend  a  helping  hand  in  helping  to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty.

A further area that I want to focus on is  the  economic  sustainability  of
our housing developments.  Whilst  the  housing  development  programme  has
positively impacted on over 5 million people throughout our country, one  of
the challenges that we  face  are  the  levels  of  rising  unemployment  in
households. The impacts of this are many: from not being able  to  put  food
on the table, to paying for services and buying basic necessities.
The challenge of job creation is not only a challenge for Government or  the
private sector, but also for the country. It is a  challenge  for  each  and
every South African to overcome. Our housing developments  need  to  consist
of not only houses, but also  community  halls,  police  stations,  schools,
parks and sports fields, all of which help  to  create  vibrant  and  active
communities.

We must ensure that new housing developments are built close  to  identified
areas of economic growth, and that there is available  and  easy  access  to
transport. We need centres in which economic activity  can  take  place  and
aspiring entrepreneurs can be given the opportunity to  start  plying  their
trade. In this regard I am  suggesting  that  we  urgently  investigate  the
provision of a shopping complex in each new housing development.

At a local level there is a need for the private sector and  the  public  at
large to volunteer to assist community members in identifying  job  creation
projects, to  assist  them  in  providing  training  on  how  to  run  their
businesses, to monitor their progress and to help ensure that the  frontiers
of poverty are pushed back.  This  is  yet  another  opportunity  for  South
Africans to embrace the spirit of Letsema.

In conclusion, as members of the housing portfolio  committee  we  have  all
experienced the joy  of  millions  of  our  people  whose  lives  have  been
positively changed. For millions of people the ANC slogan  ``A  better  life
for all'' has become a real and living experience. [Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  the  Budget  Vote
before us  represents  one  of  the  most  tangible  aspects  of  Government
delivery, namely housing. The UDM recognises  that  all  basic  human  needs
culminate in a proper shelter  and,  as  such,  it  is  the  cornerstone  of
service delivery.

One must acknowledge that  the  department  has  achieved  many  significant
goals in the past eight years. But we cannot  ignore  the  fact  that  major
problems and challenges remain. As far as the overall budget  is  concerned,
it is good to see an  improvement  in  the  overall  budget  baseline.  This
increase, we believe, should be targeted at  increasing  individual  housing
subsidies.

The UDM welcomes the proposed increase in the housing subsidy, but  now  the
department must show the willingness to turn this paper benefit into a  real
benefit for people on the ground. The sad truth is that the housing  subsidy
has not tracked inflation over the years, and this latest increase  is  more
a question of catching up rather than additional value. The current  subsidy
is only barely adequate in some geographic areas. But where the  terrain  is
not level or the ground is thorny, the costs soar  and  the  subsidy  simply
does not meet the most basic of requirements.

It is therefore imperative that ways of increasing the  subsidy  is  sought.
In this regard, the UDM supports the People's Housing Process  as  a  method
of  stretching  the  subsidy,  empowering  the  beneficiaries  as  well   as
broadening the choice of the beneficiaries.
The estimates of the national expenditure for this  Budget  Vote  refers  to
the People's Housing Process as a programme  under  its  strategic  overview
and key policy developments.

Unfortunately, it does not appear as a separate  item  in  the  department's
budget. I want to appeal to the Minister to remedy this situation  in  order
for  this  crucial  initiative  to  be  reflected  as  a  priority  of  this
department in its budget.

Allow me to return to my opening remarks about housing being  a  cornerstone
in the broader delivery context.  To  the  UDM,  poverty,  unemployment  and
fragmented government policies are the  three  biggest  reasons  for  people
still being homeless. South  Africa  requires,  in  our  opinion,  a  policy
framework that advocates  an  integrated  approach  whereby  housing  policy
falls within  a  larger  economic  strategy  to  create  jobs  in  order  to
successfully combat and eradicate homelessness and poverty.

In the long term, Government should ensure that communities have  access  to
jobs and infrastructure, not just  housing.  Having  houses  in  communities
without jobs, roads, schools, clinics, water  and  electricity  simply  does
not address the  needs  of  people,  because  these  are  things  that  make
communities viable and sustainable.

It remains the firm conviction  of  the  UDM  that  massive  infrastructural
development is required. Those who wish  to  disagree  need  only  visit  an
informal  settlement  or  rural  village  to  observe  for  themselves   the
staggering shortage of infrastructure that daily affects the  lives  of  the
majority of the population. Aside from enabling vital service delivery,  the
job creation potential of massive infrastructure  development  must  not  be
underestimated.  The  department's  involvement  in  the  human   settlement
redevelopment programme and, as under programme  three,  the  assistance  of
the department to  other  national  departments  to  develop  infrastructure
policy, is a measure that we support.

These types of initiatives must be extended to  encompass  every  effort  of
the  Government.  In  effect,  the  presidential  Urban  and  Rural  Renewal
Strategy must become a blueprint for  all  government  activities.  The  UDM
describes  such  an  integrated  strategy  in  its   policy   as   ``planned
sustainable development''. We are convinced that the Department  of  Housing
can meaningfully contribute within such an approach in the absence of ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr D G MKONO: The UDM supports the Vote. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms S H NTOMBELA: Mr Chairperson, recently  the  President  made  a  historic
visit to our constituency. Something like this has  never  happened  before,
where the President of the country visited that area, and where  our  people
were able to sit with him under the same roof, talk to him, and  even  touch
him.

Those who could not ask questions during the imbizo gave letters,  questions
and notes to  me  to  present  to  the  President.  Amongst  the  letters  I
received, one letter touched me. I want to read it to hon  members  so  that
they can fully grasp the plight which our people find themselves in.

[This letter reads thus:

To the honourable President Mbeki:


  I am a widow and a parent of four schoolgoing children. I stayed  on  the
  farm for more than twenty-five years. I was actually born on the farm and
  I worked there until the day my employer decided to kick me out  of  work
  like a dog. Having said that, my mind was struck by a poem which we  were
  brought up with, which was instilled in our minds, whether we liked it or
  not. This poem was entitled: "Say hullo to the boss".


     Greet the boss so that so that you can fill your stomach,
     Fill your stomach with the bits of  food  that  are  falling  from  the
     table,
     The boss's table is filled with a variety of foodstuffs,
     These foodstuffs are really mouthwatering,
     They virtually attract you when you are passing by.


     Greet the boss so that you should be favoured.
     Be favoured by the boss and his wife on the verandah,
     So that his wife can offer you her old flared skirt,
     That the boss can offer you his old trousers,
     Kneel down so that you should be favoured,
     So that the boss can laugh and enjoy himself,
     And even call his son to see for himself.

This letter continues as follows:


  Honourable President Mbeki, I did  all  these  things  and  destroyed  my
  dignity. I knelt down and entertained the son of my master,  so  that  my
  master could favour me. But he never favoured me. Instead  he  kicked  me
  off his farm like a dog, poor as I was. I had no money or any  corrugated
  material with which I could erect a shack. He kicked me  out  in  exactly
  the same way as when a dog is kicked out. He kicked me out  and  told  me
  that I was already crippled and useless. Honourable President  Mbeki,  my
  master forgot that I took care of his children for many  years.  He  also
  forgot that the delicious food on the table was prepared  and  cooked  by
  me, for many years.


  I then headed for the townships and lived in a shack which I erected with
  the corrugated material which was offered to me by other people. I stayed
  there and during rainy days I would dig a furrow right inside  the  shack
  so that water could go through. I would hang our blankets on the  washing
  line early in the morning because they would be wet as a  result  of  the
  rain having rushed over them. There was no difference between  me  and  a
  person who had no shelter at all, who had never worked towards something.
  Oh no! How I wasted my time by worshipping the master. My boss, how cruel
  you are! You disappointed me.


  In 1994 I saluted the ANC and experienced miracles. I acquired a 45m2 RDP
  house. Hey, man, not only that! The house was built on my own  site,  and
  not that of  the  boss.  I  was  provided  with  electricity,  which  was
  something I never thought I would acquire in  my  whole  life.  I  really
  experienced miracles.


  Ms Sankie performed miracles for me. The house featured a toilet  inside,
  and a sewerage system exactly the  same  as  the  one  belonging  to  the
  master's wife. You know something, at my master's place I had to  walk  a
  long distance in order to get water from a local dam. We  used  to  share
  water with cows, cats, dogs and other animals. But  now,  a  miracle  has
  happened. I have water inside my house, and not only that,  I  no  longer
  walk long distances in order to get it. I have clean  water.  Oh  yes!  I
  saluted Ms Sankie and the shack because a dream,  a  thing  of  the  past
  happened to me.


  Honourable President Mbeki, I would like to thank you.  You  really  have
  changed my life. Today, I am also counted among people.  That  is  why  I
  take this vow and say: ``My family and I will serve and vote for the  ANC
  until we die. Ms Sankie, no matter what they say, go on, because you  are
  on the right track. You've got it right. Although there are problems here
  and there, the crux  of  the  matter  is  that  you've  got  it  right''.
  [Applause.]


  May God bless you. Honourable President Mbeki, we are praying for you  on
  a daily basis. I thank you.


  Yours Sincerely
  Meriama Mkoena, Mafahleneng Tweeling.

[Applause.]

Honourable  Chairperson,  I  felt  grateful  after  reading   this   letter,
realising that the ANC Government has changed people's lives. It is  not  we
who are speaking;  you  have  heard  for  yourselves  that  even  people  at
grassroots  level  are  speaking.  A  few  months  ago  when  we  were  busy
travelling through  the  provinces,  Ms  Sankie,  we  say  some  development
construction companies which were said to belong to women. But  we  realised
that they were just umbrellas. They are actually serving  to  help  men  who
are our oppressors to gain the 10% which you meant to be gained by women  in
all the provinces.

There are unfortunately  women  who  are  still  scared  and  who  lack  the
necessary confidence. However, I would like to appeal to  our  Minister,  Ms
Sankie, to ensure that women are provided with training so that they  should
understand and have knowledge about tenders and the  manner  in  which  they
are completed. Women must be trained so  that  they  can  build  houses  for
themselves.  They  must  be  able  to  own  these  construction   companies.
[Applause.]

Should we be able to do that, Ms Sankie, it would mean  that  we've  got  it
right, even more than ever before. You should know  about  the  saying  that
goes: ``Training a woman represents national  education''.  But  training  a
man in most cases represents training for an individual man. When  the  hawk
comes its way, a hen hides its chicks under its  wings  but  the  cock  runs
away.

I thank you!]
Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Chair, hon Minister, life, liberty and  the  right  to
own property is an inalienable  right.  Every  man  has  the  right  to  own
property and be able to build a home in order to have security  and  shelter
to protect his or her family.

Housing is identified as one of the visible deliverables of  government  and
is used to measure the success of government. With the exorbitant prices  of
private land, Government is unable to purchase land  to  make  it  available
for development. The question is: How much land  does  the  Government  own?
Although  there  is  not  a  clear  register  of  all  state  land,  central
Government, parastatals and other quasi-Government organisations hold  about
one third of land in South Africa.

The rapid release of land for development must be identified  in  order  for
the  various  programmes  and  projects  for  housing  deliverables  to   be
realised. It is commendable of Government to have  approved  and  built  1,3
million housing units,  but  there  is  still  a  vast  backlog,  with  ever
increasing numbers in informal settlement and the yearly increase  in  costs
of building materials, as well as the high increase in unemployment.  It  is
unrealistic to maintain the R16 000 subsidy, and I would like to  thank  the
Minister for the good news that it is increased to R20 000. I am  sure  most
people will be happy to hear that. However, if homeowners are encouraged  to
save and contribute toward the cost more people can be assisted.

The People's Housing Process is one of the successful  programmes,  in  that
homeowners, through sweat equity and savings, are  able  to  build  a  house
according  to  their  needs.  This  had  developed  a  sense  of  pride  and
achievement  and  produced  a  better  product  than  conventional  building
methods.

One of the policy issues of the 2001 Cabinet's lekgotla -  and  it  is  what
the ACDP has always advocated in this House -  is  that  appropriate  models
for the development of traditional housing  must  be  found.  This,  coupled
with own contribution and  saving,  will  instil  a  culture  of  ownership,
thereby removing the culture of dependency on  Government.  Homeowners  will
be less likely to sell their houses, or be conned or swindled by  gangsters,
drug lords or speculators out of their property.

Government needs to  focus  more  on  an  integrated  development  plan  for
housing. Instead of building houses in clusters,  Government  should  rather
develop sustainable rural and urban settlements that will improve the socio-
economic opportunities of each settlement. This is  where  a  great  concern
is.

I think Government should come up with a clear policy and must devise it  to
address the impact of HIV/Aids on housing. In South Africa we  know  we  are
facing a crisis and there are many households where one or both parents  die
of Aids and leave the  family,  especially  the  children,  destitute.  What
happens is that people fall back into the cycle of homelessness. So, I  want
to thank the Minister for her speech today. [Applause.]

Ms M A SEECO: Mr Chairman, hon  members,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  UCDP
stands to support the budget as placed before this House. We  understand  it
in broader sense as well as of the economy of the Republic of South  Africa.
The South African Government is committed to reducing poverty and  improving
the quality of life of the people.

Housing has undergone fundamental  changes.  More  than  a  million  housing
units have been built, providing  more  than  5  million  poor  people  with
shelter. According to the Minister of Housing, self-building has  proved  to
be one of the most effective strategies in producing quality housing.

The Minister of  Housing  also  plans  to  implement  an  emergency  housing
development programme to effect funding allocations without delay  in  order
to  alleviate  emergency  housing  needs.  Housing  expenditure   has   been
increased from R3 785 013 in 2001-02 to R4 244 800 in the current  financial
year. This allocation makes it one of the  top  ten  votes  in  the  overall
budget, with 3,74% of the pie.

My concern is with the budget per programme. Does  the  department  have  an
internal policy on HIV/Aids? How much has been budgeted for the  policy  and
other HIV-related expenditure within the department?

Expenditure for this programme is expected to increase from R7,2 million  in
2001-02 to R14,2 million in 2002-03.

The  lack  of  capacity,  which  entails  an  efficient  workforce  and  the
installation  of  appropriate  technology,   equipment   and   systems   for
monitoring,  evaluation  and  reporting  purposes,  is  one  of  the   major
constraints in housing delivery. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs M S MAINE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, in the  Sowetan
of 23 April 2002 there was an  article  on  women,  youth  and  people  with
disabilities in housing. The MEC of housing in  the  Limpopo  province,  Joe
Maswanganyi, announced that they have allocated an  estimated  R179  million
for the construction of low-cost housing to companies owned by women,  youth
and people with  disabilities.  He  went  on  to  say  that  youth  who  own
construction companies will compete for tenders for  the  erection  of  low-
cost housing from a pool of  R88,1  million.  Women  contractors  have  been
allocated R57 million and the disabled persons  have  been  allocated  R34,6
million.

Given all that, is it not saying that the ANC is definitely  delivering  and
that it is not sexist, racist and discriminatory?

[Allow me to ask. Maybe we need to make changes  to  the  application  forms
for subsidies so that there should be a  column  for  those  who  stay  with
disabled people so that their houses should be user-friendly to those  using
wheelchairs. Again, if an applicant personally belongs to  the  category  of
persons that I have mentioned, a house which is user-friendly to his or  her
needs should be built so that he or she is pleased with it.

It is very important that disabled people should be part  of  the  decision-
making that concerns the building of houses,  so  that  they  can  see  that
their rights are protected. They should be encouraged to take  part  in  all
discussions about the building of houses.

Talking about the youth is talking about our country's future. If we  should
fail to show them the right way by teaching them to be responsible we  would
in future have a nation without foresight. We need to train  them  with  all
the experience that we have.

They should take part in construction  companies  that  participate  in  the
building of houses particularly, because they will inherit  them.  As  such,
they must ensure that we do not leave them with a worthless inheritance  for
their future.

I am appealing to the MECs present here to build a  better  future  for  the
youth. Reduce their ignorance. Change their unemployment status. Stop  their
mischievousness. Fight their loss of hope. Inculcate in  them  a  spirit  of
being active. Brighten up their future with building construction  companies
so that they may be healthy heirs. We must do all these things as the  ANC's
biggest aim is that of a better life for all.]

With over one million housing subsidies granted  and  many  of  them  either
built or in construction phase, the South African  Government  has  achieved
much towards its aim of providing housing for people previously denied  home
ownership. However, parallel to these  developments,  over  the  past  eight
years HIV/Aids has reached a crisis point in South Africa. This epidemic  is
undermining development.  To  intercept  the  disease  and  find  out  about
factors that either impede or encourage transmission  and  appropriate  care
require urgent attention at research, policy and implementation levels.

The built environment  that  shapes  the  psychological,  social,  cultural,
health and safety features in a community could  positively  impact  on  the
spread and treatment of the  epidemic.  The  affordability  and  quality  of
houses and how they reflect integrated community living could contribute  to
minimising its spread. However, the  current  situation  reveals  that  some
housing projects are being developed in ways that do not support  a  healthy
physical, social or economic environment. Thus,  the  multiple  deprivations
faced by poor households, many of whom also face the  challenges  of  coping
with HIV/Aids, are exacerbated as they wait for or live in  inappropriately-
designed houses. These factors severely undermine the  quality  of  life  of
people living with HIV/Aids.

HIV/Aids has  led  to  a  breakdown  of  families  and  the  functioning  of
households. This further undermines the housing  policy  assumptions.  There
is a growing crisis of children orphaned by Aids who are sent to  live  with
elderly relatives who often support them  from  their  meagre  pensions,  or
orphaned children who are left to fend  for  themselves,  which  results  in
dire economic and social consequences.  The  impact  that  HIV/Aids  has  on
households means that the manner in which the housing  policy  was  intended
to work no longer holds true. It  is  at  this  level  that  the  impact  of
HIV/Aids is most directly experienced and where policies and action need  to
be responsive.

[All of this means that the Minister's  challenge  has  increased,  but  the
fact is that the Minister is surrounded by active MECs  who  understand  the
President's appeal of voluntarism, the Minister  will  lead  them  and  they
will not lead astray. To the  Minister  and  others  I  say  that  she  must
persevere.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I would like to congratulate Zoe Kota  on  her
speech and position as chairperson.

The Department of Housing has been tasked  with  an  extremely  challenging,
demanding and difficult task  from  the  outset.  Noting  the  thousands  of
homeless and the constitutional declaration of the  requirement  to  provide
in the needs of people, the challenge was enormous.
We have had major improvements and delivery has been  made.  However,  media
coverage of the success of the department has not  been  as  prioritised  as
the negative aspects which cause a serious lack of confidence by the  public
in Government's ability to deliver and fulfil the promises made.  Though  we
are well past our second election, transformation is still gradually  taking
place.  Results  have  been  achieved  and  the  expectancy  for   overnight
deliveries is so ridiculous, after years of pitiful hardship.

The Ministry of Housing is complimented by the MF for  the  provisions  that
it has made to  those  previously  houseless.  We  have  recently  noted  an
incident in KwaZulu-Natal where tenants unable to keep up with  payments  in
housing which has been provided for them are being treated with kindness  of
being relocated instead of being evicted, as would be  the  treatment  given
by a private landlord.  This  serves  as  an  example  of  the  department's
dedication towards bridging the gap, and correcting injustices of  the  past
with serious commitment to promoting  social  development  in  the  country.
However, though the department deserves a pat on the back,  the  reality  of
so many who are still homeless and in need of decent housing  facilities  is
large. Immediate attention  and  co-ordination  through  a  structured  plan
would serve to reduce these statistics.

The MF firmly supports the department's aim to determine, finance,  promote,
co-ordinate, communicate and  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  housing
policy and human settlement. It is felt that if the budget  of  R4  244  800
000 is wisely utilised, the results of delivery would be  both  visible  and
remarkable.

The MF voices its plea to roof the homeless, shelter  the  roofless  and  to
protect our  people  as  pledged.  We  welcome  the  launch  of  the  recent
allocation of houses for the homeless in KwaZulu-Natal  and  we  would  also
like to encourage all role-players to actively participate  in  Vukuzenzele.
[Applause.]

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, it looks like I will never stop teaching.  I  have
to teach people every day.

I would like to start off with my good friend, Ms Semple. She  really  needs
a little bit of education. Firstly, I would like to point out to  Ms  Semple
that this is not the first increase, but that it is the third  increase.  It
was initially R15 000, then it became R16 000 and now it  is  R20  000.  For
her information, I would like to tell her that it has increased in the  past
five years. [Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Considering inflation.

Mr J H NASH:  Yes,  considering  inflation.  If  the  member  had  read  the
Minister's document, she  would  have  noticed  that  the  increase  is  now
26,87%. It is well above inflation. [Applause.]

The figure of 48,8% is well above inflation  and  54%  is  also  well  above
inflation. So, let me deal with the second point. Ms Semple  asked  what  it
is that we are going to  do  with  those  people  in  the  People's  Housing
Process who build substandard homes. If  one  is  in  the  People's  Housing
Process and  builds  one's  own  home,  is  one  going  to  build  it  in  a
substandard manner? [Laughter.] I have yet to see a home that  is  built  by
the People's Housing Process that is substandard. In fact,  the  quality  of
those homes is way up there.

An HON MEMBER: Where?

Mr J H NASH: If that member wants to know, he should ask Ms Semple.  She  is
going to tell him. [Laughter.] She was with me when she saw those homes.  We
were asked: Where are the poor people going to get the money from  in  order
to pay for the extra R2 400? I would like to say that in South Africa  there
are stokvels which are run by poor people.

Ms R TALJAARD: [Inaudible.]

Mr J H NASH: Ms Taljaard would not know because she does not touch the  poor
areas. [Laughter.] She and her party are never there. So she would not  know
about these things.

An HON MEMBER: What about Buffalo Flats?

Mr J H NASH: Does that hon member want to know about Buffalo  Flats?  If  he
wants to know about Buffalo Flats, then I will tell him.  The  ladies  there
walk with huge dishes of cooked mielies selling it and shouting up and  down
the street: Umbona! Umbona! [Mielies!] [Applause.] That is what  happens  at
Buffalo Flats. That does not happen in Port Elizabeth, no! [Laughter.]  They
only write about coconuts. [Laughter.]

We have to examine the construction of subsidy homes in  the  light  of  the
different sizes and quality of homes in different  provinces.  Most  of  the
big contractors are producing 30 square  metre  dwellings,  while  many  are
producing homes of 42 to 45 square metres.

On our provincial visits we saw homes of a mere 18  square  metres.  Really,
what a shame! It is time that we as Government set down the minimun size  of
a subsidy home to at least 40 square metres. Why can  a  contractor  in  the
small town of Barkly East  build  a  home  of  40  square  metres  with  two
bedrooms and a large open-plan lounge and kitchen,  using  bricks,  while  a
large contractor in North West  builds  a  single  room  with  blocks,  very
lightly bagged, for the same amount of money? [Interjections.]

For Ms Semple's benefit, both those contractors are white. So  her  attempts
at saying that we are condemning white  contractors  is  not  true.  We  are
condemning  contractors  that  are  exploiting  the  poorest  of  the  poor.
[Applause.]

When we  challenged  the  construction  and  the  material  they  used,  the
contractor said that it complied with  the  minimum  standards  of  building
regulations. In another scheme by the  same  contractor,  a  very  expensive
road was built to allow access to taxis  and  buses.  [Interjections.]  Once
again, the money could have been used to improve  the  size  of  thoseÿ.ÿ.ÿ.
[Interjections.] What did that hon member do in his time, while  he  was  in
Parliament? What did he do? He sat dead quiet, while houses were  not  being
built. He sat dead quiet, but this Government has built 1,0  million  homes.
What did Mr Gibson's party do  except  criticise?  [Applause.]  Mr  Gibson's
party did nothing, except criticise.

An HON MEMBER: Who is responsible for the current situation?

Mr J H NASH: The hon member is asking who is  responsible  for  the  current
situation. Does the hon member know what the current situation is?  We  have
built 1 000 200 homes for homeless people. [Applause.] That is  the  current
situation.

An HON MEMBER: Eighteen square metres!

Mr J H NASH: Eighteen square metres? Does that  hon  member  know  in  which
province that is? McIntosh's province! [Laughter.]

I would like to apologise to Minister Sankie. [Interjections.] Why should  I
apologise when we have built  homes?  The  hon  member  must  apologise  for
sitting there, doing nothing but criticising! That  is  what  should  happen
with Mr Gibson.

The SPEAKER: Order! Do you have a point of order?

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I am  not  quite  sure
if it is parliamentary for the two hon members on the other  side,  the  hon
Gibson and that other hon member, to engage the speaker on the  podium  with
the type of extra energy that they seem to have at this stage. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, in the energy stakes, I think it was  pretty
equal. [Laughter.] But I do think you need to address the question that  you
are supposed to be debating. Would you please proceed.

Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, I would like to tell Minister Sankie that we  as
the committee feel that we should insist on the quality and size of homes.
Mr G B D McINTOSH: Why don't you?

Mr J H NASH: Listen. We are increasing the subsidy. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I think you should  allow  the  speaker  to
proceed with his speech.

Mr J H  NASH:  Oh,  at  last,  they  are  asked  to  keep  quiet.  At  last!
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I suggest you proceed with your text!

Mr J H NASH: Yes, but you must protect me! [Laughter.]

We  are  increasing  the  subsidy.  Now  we  should  consider  the   thermal
efficiency of homes. In a pilot scheme of homes in Lady Grey in the  Eastern
Cape, we built four homes where we took into account their thermal  quality.
These homes are north-facing and have  larger  windows,  as  well  as  floor
coverings and ceilings; the roof overhangs are longer so  that  the  sun  is
kept out in summer, while in winter the rooms are protected.

These extra innovations cost an extra R3 000 per unit. The money  was  given
by the Netherlands government and was very welcome as it  has  improved  the
quality of life of these people. [Applause.]

We say to contractors in South Africa,  as  well  as  the  banks  and  other
suppliers: Why can they not forget  the  profit  motive  and  think  of  the
quality of life of South Africans? I must hasten  to  say  that  we  as  the
committee realised that contractors are there to  make  money.  But  we  are
asking them to share some of the  profits  for  the  social  upliftment  and
improvement of the quality of life of those less fortunate. We ask  them  to
go the extra mile.

Our latest policy shift is towards encouraging tenants to  save.  The  banks
can also help those customers when they want to  improve  their  homes.  Our
people are saving. They say they want to know whether we do save. Of  course
we save. The stokvels are saving millions with banks. My  question  is:  Are
the banks giving some of those millions back to those people who  save?  The
answer is no. In some cases, some of the banks are coming to the party.  But
our major banks also need to come to the party. They need  to  come  to  the
party which says ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Malibongwe,  nyani  malibongwe.  Mme  Ntombela,  ke
kopa hore o kgutlisetse karabo ya lengolo le tswang ho Mme Mirriam  Mokoena.
O mo jwetse hore  ANC  e  re,`  Montsamaisa  bosiu,  ya  nthusang  ho  rwala
mathata, ke mo leboha bo sele.' [Ditlatse.] [I salute you! Mrs  Ntombela,  I
would like you to reply to Mrs Merriama Mokoena's letter.  Will  you  please
tell her that the ANC says: ``I'd like to thank He  who  guides  me  through
darkness, He who makes me able to overcome my troubles, I'd  like  to  thank
Him publicly.'' [Applause.]] To those hon members who obviously do not  have
the necessary information, I think we will assist them in  that  respect  so
that they would be able to make meaningful and positive contributions.

I wish to tell the hon Semple and the hon  Southgate  that  this  Government
started talking about integrated development about two and half  years  ago.
One has to recognise the fact  that  integrated  development  requires  high
levels of co-ordination. At the same time, it has to be realised  that  when
we came into office, we  inherited  a  fragmented  dysfunctional  system  of
government. It also has to be realised that with all of these  problems,  we
have really made huge strides. We have been able, in some of  the  projects,
to co-ordinate, integrate and align  our  resources  whenever  there  was  a
need.

However, it also  has  to  be  noted  that  currently  Government  talks  of
clusters, way down from director-general level to Minister and down  to  the
provinces, because we are actually saying that we now have  the  opportunity
to proceed in an integrated manner.

Initiatives in this  respect  have  already  been  made.  In  medium-density
housing, for example, in the  new  town  precinct  such  as  the  Tsutsumani
village in Alexander and other projects, Government has  been  able  to  co-
ordinate their efforts. We put together our resources, our money,  the  NHFC
as well,  and  we  have  been  able  to  come  up  with  projects  that  are
sustainable. So it is not a new phenomenon.

Last Sunday, just the other day, we were honouring those of  the  developers
and contractors who have been able to respond to the  call  for  integration
and innovation. We have  been  able  to  identify  the  Besters  project  in
Durban, as well as the social housing projects in Gauteng, East  London  and
Cape Town, which have actually gone the route of integration.

But we have also recognised the effort by the Van der  Leij-Habitat  project
in East London. This reflects the integrated approach by Government.  So  it
is something that we have already started doing and we are emulating.

Our programmes, the urban renewal and rural development nodes,  are  also  a
clear  indication  that  that  is  the  route  we  would  like  to  take  as
Government. Of course, in terms of the subsidy  we  have  always  recognised
the fact that we  have  to  relate  to  inflation,  and  we  have  made  the
necessary adjustments.

Mr Nash is correct, we have had three increases. In 1999-2000  we  increased
the subsidy to R17 272; in 2000-01 to R18 694; and currently it  is  at  R20
300. So these are the kinds of issues that we have been looking at,  because
I think most of the  people  working  in  housing  know  the  situation  and
understand the problems.

A question was  also  raised  in  relation  to  whether  the  National  Home
Builders Registration Council would have the capacity and ability to do  the
work which they have been asked to do. Yes, they can. They  will  have  that
ability and capability because we have put aside resources last year,  R17,6
million, for them to deal with this issue, specifically the task  that  they
are supposed to perform. So we have actually funded that exercise of  making
sure that that capacity is built.

We have also made sure that both the human  capacity  and  the  systems  are
upgraded, to assist them in ensuring that they now move  into  another  area
of responsibility, which is the RDP housing, because  we  have  always  said
that we wanted to strive for good quality.

As for the issue of savings, I think Mr Nash raised a very  important  issue
here. You see, people who are not involved in dealing  with  communities  of
the poor will never understand and will never  know.  Actually,  they  would
never even envisage the kind of things that the poor people can do. I  would
like to inform the hon members that,  way  back  in  1995,  even  before  we
enforced the question of people having to come forward with the R2 479,  the
poor were already saving on their own  without  anybody  pressurising  them.
[Applause.]

For example, when the Department of Housing took from its budget  an  amount
of R10 million to jointly manage with the SA Homeless  People's  Federation,
they had at that point already saved R234 000 on their own. So the  poor  do
have integrity and pride. They do not want to be made to feel like  helpless
people who cannot do anything for themselves. So stop patronising  the  poor
because they are ready. They are in the trenches and are building. They  are
the driving force behind the People's Housing Process. [Applause.]  And  not
those who are comfortable and pontificate about whether the  poor  can  save
or not.

However, what needs to be realised is that we are working  on  systems  that
are going to assist us to link those savings to our housing subsidy and,  if
possible, if we do get the appropriate response from the banks, we  will  be
able to link up that chain back to the banks, ie those banks that are  ready
to work with us. We have been making investigations in this respect. So,  we
are planning to make sure that it does happen and does  not  just  become  a
policy thrust and an approach, but does actually get  to  be  developed  and
improved upon as a policy enhancing our efforts.

As for Ms Semple, batho ba Modimo [my God],  in  those  projects  where  she
finds that there are things that look a bit funny, she must realise that  it
is not because of our policy, but is because of those  people  who  are  not
adhering to the policy. Our housing policy says - if I  may  assist  her  in
this respect - we are going out there to deliver and work with the poor,  to
come up with a package that is total.  We  pay  for  the  land  and  provide
people with security of tenure. We connect the water,  so  that  people  can
have clean water for health purposes and everything  else.  We  connect  the
electricity and gravel the roads. [Interjections.]

We have asked the developers to make sure that we at least do have a  shower
in each house. And where she finds that this has not  happened,  it  is  not
because of the policy. We are doing something about it and we  do  go  back,
assisted by the national consumer registration Act, to  ask  the  developers
to complete their construction. If they do not comply we have the  power  to
scrap them from the roll.

As for who the inspectors are, in terms of what would be happening  when  we
monitor RDP housing in making sure that we  get  the  best  quality,  it  is
going to be up to the registration council,  with  the  capacity  that  they
have. In the past, it was the provincial  housing  teams  that  we  set  up,
including the technical teams from the provincial  departments  who  usually
go out to make  sure  that  the  norms,  standards  and  specifications  are
adhered to.

As for the planning, if one goes the integrated approach  route,  one  would
realise that it is going to include alignment of budgets, planning  together
and  making  sure  that  we  do  incorporate,  in  our  settlements,   total
communities with all of the facilities that we have mentioned. It must  also
be remembered that it is going to be impossible for us to say that,  if  the
Department of Local Government  is  ready  to  pursue  a  particular  policy
objective, they should not do that: they have to wait  for  housing  to  get
ready before they do their work.

So one needs to understand that we have our settlements in  the  pattern  in
which they are simply because at that point we were ready to deliver and  we
wanted to make sure that we reduce the backlog to about  a  statistic  of  a
million. We have achieved that and we are now into the  second  million.  We
are going to go  back  to  our  project,  like  we  are  going  through  our
auditing, to make sure  that  we  do  complete  the  exercise  of  providing
complete communities wherever Government has been able to invest. So  it  is
not like it is all lost and forgotten, not at all. [Interjections.]

We do inspect. Where is the member who raised  the  issue?  I  am  not  sure
whether he is servicing a constituency that needs my  investigation.  He  is
servicing the upper class community. [Interjections.] He is not!

As for HIV/Aids, we are conducting a survey, which is going to assist us  to
get the proper statistics, in the first place, and,  secondly,  to  look  at
what the impact of HIV is going to be with regard  to  the  housing  demand.
Thirdly, we are also going to make sure that  within  the  Housing  industry
this issue gets the appropriate attention. Lastly, we are going to  look  at
the comparative influence and impact of HIV on housing finance. And as  soon
as this investigation is done, we will be able to put together a policy.

However, on an ad hoc  basis,  those  children  who  are  without  heads  of
households have been accommodated in structures, through  the  institutional
approach, in KwaZulu-Natal. We have two projects in  KwaZulu-Natal,  one  in
Pietermaritzburg and another supported by an NGO in Mpumalanga. We might  be
having more, but I  am  talking  about  those  projects  that  have  a  high
profile.

We are taking care of these kids. But in the spirit  of  co-ordination,  co-
operation  and  an  integrated   approach,   the   Departments   of   Social
Development, Housing and Health are jointly working on how we are  going  to
align our budgets, for example, to make  sure  that  such  children  do  get
their social grants and that their health  is  being  taken  care  of,  and,
where necessary, also that Housing plays its role. So Government  is  seized
with that situation.

Mr Herandien wanted to know whether the 15% geocheck consideration is  going
to apply with the increment. Yes, it is going to  apply,  no  worries  about
that. We will be able to make sure that people  do  benefit  because  it  is
specifically set aside to make sure that difficult conditions, such as  high
water water levels, dolomite, etc, are taken care of. In the  Western  Cape,
for example, there is the condensation problem.  We  have  to  set  aside  a
specific allocation to make sure that we do deal with that  problem  because
it is a climatic one.

The hon Mr Mkono is concerned that we  do  not  have  the  People's  Housing
Process as a separate programme. Hon members should please be aware  of  the
fact that last  year  we  took  a  policy  decision  that  as  soon  as  the
provincial  allocation  is  channelled  to  the  provinces  we  expect   the
provinces to set aside  10%  of  their  budgets  for  the  People's  Housing
Process. Feedback from the community indicates that  more  and  more  people
want to go the route of the People's Housing Process. So  one  can  consider
that a very specific and special project, which is being given and  accorded
the appropriate status it needs to be given by Government.

Lastly, I think we should come to a stage in this House where  we  begin  to
really consider very seriously the kind of contribution  we  want  to  make.
The aim should not be to score political  points,  but  for  departments  to
assist hon members that are here to identify those problems  that  need  our
attention. If we do not utilise the time to make sure that as this House  we
do co-ordinate our efforts in order to address the needs  of  the  poor,  we
are going to be left behind because  the  world  has  taken  a  decision  at
different fora, be it Nepad, the UN-Habitat  or  the  UN  General  Assembly,
that by the year 2015 we should have reduced the levels  of  poverty  by  at
least  half.  I  think  that  is  a  huge  challenge,  not  just  for  those
institutions, but for us in this House especially. Let us  please  use  this
time profitably and move away from unnecessary heckling. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The SPEAKER: Order! I wish to inform members  that  a  candlelight  ceremony
will be held tomorrow at noon in the lobby of the  National  Assembly.  This
will be part of the National HIV/Aids - Share your vision for a better  life
campaign.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 19:32.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of Portfolio Committee on Trade and  Industry  on  Budget  Vote
     31: Trade and Industry, dated 8 May 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry, having considered Budget
     Vote 31, reports as follows:


     Introduction


     The committee examined the  budget  of  the  Department  of  Trade  and
     Industry (Vote 31) for the 2002/3 financial year as well as the forward
     estimates for 2003/4 and 2004/5 included in the Estimates  of  National
     Expenditure.


     Main features


     The main features of the 2002/3 budget are:


         *  The Department is allocated R2 468,6 million for  the  financial
           year 2002/3, while forward estimates anticipate it receiving  R2
           627,0 million and R2 787,5  million  in  the  years  2003/4  and
           2004/5 respectively. This compares to the R2 214,6 million voted
           in last year's budget which rose to  R2  280,1  million  in  the
           Adjusted Appropriation for 2000/1. The Department's  budget  for
           2001/2 is broadly in line with last year's forward estimate  for
           2001/2  (which  was  R2  465,1  million),  as  is   the   amount
           anticipated for 2003/4. The  Department's  budget  can  thus  be
           described as a constant budget with minor fluctuations.


         *  The 2002/3 budget is divided into six  programmes,  compared  to
           the previous five. These are: Programme 1, Administration,  (6,9
           % of the total), Programme 2, International  Trade  Development,
           (2,7%), Programme 3, Enterprise and Industry Development, (33%),
           Programme 4, Consumer and Corporate Regulation (5,4%), Programme
           5, The Enterprise Organization (34%) and Programme 6, Trade  and
           Investment South Africa (18%). The programmes broadly correspond
           to the Department's operational divisions.


         *  After growing for several years,  the  budget  for  Programme  1
           stabilizes and in fact decreases slightly from R179,5 million in
           the adjusted appropriation  for  2001/2  to  R169,6  million  in
           2002/3.


         *  The budget for activities falling under Programme  2  is  stable
           with R65, 9 million budgeted for 2002/3 compared to the  R65,  5
           in the Adjusted appropriation for 2001/2.  The  main  activities
           budgeted for under Programme 2 are multi-lateral  and  bilateral
           trade  negotiations,   the   promotion   of   African   economic
           integration  and  the   activities   of   the   Commission   for
           International Trade  Administration  (previously  known  as  the
           Board of Tariffs and Trade).


         *  The budget for Programme 3 is  reduced  slightly  from  R854,  3
           million in the Adjusted appropriation  for  2001/2  to  R815,  1
           million in 2002/3.  Programme  3  is  the  Department's  largest
           programme and includes mostly transfer  payments  to  associated
           Council of Trade & Industry (COTII) institutions.  The  decrease
           in expenditure in the present and previous budget year  reflects
           the normalization of expenditure following significant  one  off
           transfer payments  to  re-capitalize  Khula,  initial  start  up
           contributions to the National  Empowerment  Fund  and  increased
           contributions to Namac, Proudly South Africa and THRIP.


         *  Programme 4's budget is increased from R96, 8 million  to  R134,
           1 million. Some of the increase is accounted for by transfers to
           the Companies and Intellectual Property Office (CIPRO).


         *  Programme 5's budget increases from R628, 1 million to  R840,  2
           million. 97% of the expenditure under this programme consists of
           transfers  under  various  business  support   programmes.   The
           increase is largely accounted for by anticipated better take  up
           of improved support programmes, and expenditure is  expected  to
           rise further to R963, 8 and R1 021 million in 2003/4 and 2004/5.


         *  The budget for programme 6 is stable being R455,  8  million  in
           the Adjusted appropriation for 2001/2 and  R443,  6  million  in
           2002/3.


         *  Transfer payments account for approximately  82%  of  the  total
           budget. A significant part of these transfer payments  are  made
           to associated DTI "family institutions".  There  are  17  public
           entities and 3 other bodies that report to the Minister of Trade
           and Industry. These now participate in regular meetings  of  the
           Council of Trade and Industry Institutions.


         *  The budget for 2002/3 can also be  divided  into  the  following
           functional categories:


              @   Transfer to associated COTII      R690mn     28%
              @   Institutions
              @   Incentives and Offerings to
              @   Business   R1 320mn   53%
              @   Human Resources  R290mn     12%
              @   Operations R170mn     7%


     The amount for incentives  and  offerings  to  firms  is  up  from  the
     approximately R1 billion in 2001/2.


         *  The Director-General indicated that new systems were  being  put
              in  place  to  promote  greater  efficiency  in  the  use   of
              resources.  Although  these  appeared  to   focus   on   minor
              ``housekeeping'' matters, they  were  part  of  a  process  of
              getting the Department to operate faster, smarter and  quicker
              in delivering services. For example, an investigation  by  the
              Department found that in  the  recent  past  48%  of  incoming
              telephone calls were dropped. This has  now  been  reduced  to
              29%.


         *  The Department also reported  further  significant  improvements
              in organizational efficiency during 2001/2. For  example,  the
              average time to register companies or  close  corporations  at
              the Companies and Intellectual  Property  Office  (CIPRO)  has
              been reduced from 21 to 3 days.


         *  Once again, this year's budget  includes  in  the  Estimates  of
              National  Expenditure  a  table  of  "output  indicators"  and
              "targets" for Programmes 2-6. A  feature  of  the  Committee's
              interaction with the Department this year  was  that  we  were
              provided at our request, with a detailed Report on the  extent
              to which output and service delivery targets identified in the
              2001/2 budget were delivered upon.


         *  The latter report, which the Committee regards as a  major  step
              forward in its budgetary  oversight,  indicates  that  by  and
              large the Department  attained  most  of  the  output  targets
              identified in 2001/2. The report  also  indicates  that  there
              were  improvements  in  organizational  efficiency,  corporate
              governance and work environment.


         *  In terms of employment equity, the Department reported  that  it
              had  enhanced  the  Public  Service  Commission's  targets  of
              achieving 50% equity by race and 30% by gender and set  itself
              a target of 80% equity by race and 50% by gender. We were told
              that it had surpassed the latter targets,  although  there  is
              still a need to address the issue of gender equity in the more
              senior grades.


         *  The improvement in the Department's record on spending  observed
              in 2000/1 was continued in 2001/2. There is now  a  reasonable
              alignment   of   budgeted   and   actual   expenditure    with
              underspending anticipated to be a little over  10%  in  2001/2
              (excluding some reductions and anticipated commitments  to  be
              rolled over) compared to the more  than  30%  recorded  before
              1999.


         *  The Estimates of National Expenditure 2002 do  not  sufficiently
              address the financial and  resource  transfers  to  provinces,
              neither  do  they  adequately  reflect  the  impact   of   the
              Department's spending in the various provinces. The Department
              through a range of  economic  development  agencies  currently
              funds and  coordinates  various  economic  programmes  in  the
              provinces and local municipalities.


     The Committee also had an opportunity, as in previous years, to  engage
     on budgetary issues with four of the DTI's associated institutions- the
     Industrial Development Corporation,  the  Council  for  Scientific  and
     Industrial Research, Ntsika and Khula. Highlights of these  discussions
     included:


     The Industrial Development Corporation (IDC)


         *  The IDC made  515  investment  approvals  worth  R9,  3  billion
              during 2001, more than double the amount in the previous year.
              These assisted in the creation or sustaining  of  20  000  job
              opportunities and  generated  R10,  5  billion  in  additional
              export earnings.


         *  The IDC is also extensively involved in  projects  elsewhere  in
              Africa. Over the past year it increased its African  portfolio
              from  30  projects  in  9  countries  to  47  projects  in  16
              countries. Approvals in other African countries  total  almost
              R7, 6 billion since 1998.


         *  The Corporation reported further  progress  in  its  efforts  to
              promote Small and Medium Enterprise  development  as  well  as
              Black Economic Empowerment. The proportion of approvals  going
              to empowerment companies was 33 % in 2001 compared to 27%  the
              previous year. By value, this represents around 16%  of  total
              approvals. Although the Corporation does not directly  service
              the micro or very small business sector,  it  has  taken  some
              steps to make its facilities available to smaller enterprises.
              68% by value of its portfolio is with clients  with  an  asset
              base below R120 million.


         *  The IDC remains financially strong with capital and reserves  of
              R24, 4 billion (larger than any  bank  in  the  country).  Its
              involvement in two poorly performing  steel  projects-Columbus
              and Saldanha- did, however, involve it in a capital loss.  R5,
              5 billion was injected into the restructuring of Saldanha  and
              its  incorporation  into  Iscor.  This  restructuring  is  now
              complete and Saldanha is now debt free, selling  its  products
              on the domestic as well as export markets.


     The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
         *  The CSIR's  annual  turnover  is  R810  million,  of  which  60%
              emanates from clients and contracts. The Council will  receive
              just  over   R300   million   from   government   this   year,
              approximately the same as in the previous budget year.


         *  The CSIR participates in the COTII. The Council  indicated  that
              together with the DTI a number of medium term  objectives  had
              been  agreed,  including  enhancing  science  and   technology
              contributions to  industrial  technology  policy  development,
              raising awareness in industry  of  technological  development,
              contributing to development of SMMEs, BEE and access by  women
              to technology through its Technology  for  Women  in  Business
              project.  It also has 60 rural development projects,  many  in
              poverty nodes identified by government.


         *   The  CSIR  is  also  involved  in  initiatives,  projects   and
              contracts in 17 other African countries  and  is  contributing
              both to  NEPAD  and  preparations  for  the  World  Summit  on
              Sustainable Development. It has also been awarded contracts by
              major  International  Firms  including  Rolls  Royce,  Boeing,
              Daimler Chrysler and the European  Commission  for  two  food-
              related projects.


         *  The CSIR confirmed  that  the  trend  identified  last  year  of
              declining  private  sector   involvement   in   Research   and
              Development (R & D) continues to be a cause  for  concern.  We
              were told that South Africa spends around 0,7% of its GDP on R
              & D, much less than successful industrializing countries. Less
              than half this comes from the private  sector:  Reasons  which
              the Council said were cited for this included:


              1.  Less attractive tax incentives for R & D in  South  Africa
                  than other jurisdictions.
              2.  The fact that incentive schemes such as SPII were based on
                  the matching grant principle meant that there was no  real
                  incentive to begin completely new projects.
              3.   An  environment  that  did  not  sufficiently   encourage
                  university-based   researchers   to   develop   commercial
                  applications of their research.


     Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency


         *  Ntsika is continuing to re-focus its activities  away  from  its
              previous main activity of accrediting service providers  to  a
              demand  driven  provision  of  particular  services  to  small
              business.  Its  focuses  will  be  on  information  provision,
              training and advisory services.
         *  Ntsika is  also  carrying  out  a  review  of  service  provider
              intermediaries it has worked with, and will be dis-accrediting
              those that have not met defined performance criteria.


         *  Ntsika reported that from the time  of  its  inception  in  1996
              until the end of 2001, it had supported 349 service providers,
              trained 2 435 employees of service providers and  developed  2
              310 business links. Service providers trained or assisted over
              100 000  entrepreneurs  in  over  79  000  enterprises.   Jobs
              created or sustained over this period are estimated at over 98
              000.


         *  In 2002/3 Ntsika plans to support 280 service  providers,  train
              1 050 staff of service providers and develop  1  120  business
              links. It expects service providers to train or assist 60  900
              entrepreneurs in 81 500 SMMEs, thereby assisting  in  creating
              or sustaining 40 000 jobs.


         *  Ntsika is allocated  R40  million  in  the  current  budget,  an
              increase from the R35 million it received  in  2001/2.  It  is
              anticipated that it will receive R50 million in the 2003/4 and
              R60  million  in  the  2004/5  budgets.  The  agency  expects,
              however, to receive a substantial increase of donor funding  -
              rising to R35,1 million in 2002/3 compared to R12  million  in
              2001/2. We were told that this money was confirmed.  Including
              other smaller allocations, Ntsika would spend R85,  1  million
              in 2002/3 compared to R64,4 million in 2001/2.


     Khula Enterprise Finance


         *  An impact assessment study on Khula's products between 1996  and
              March 2001 carried out by UNISA's Market Research Bereau found
              that these had contributed to the creation and  sustaining  of
              788  650  jobs  over  this  period.  70%  of  these  were   in
              survivalist enterprises, with a high attrition rate.


         *  Khula plans to approve loans of R106 million and  guarantees  of
              R406 million during the current financial year, leading to the
              creation or sustaining of 124 498 jobs. It aims to ensure that
              administrative expenses do not exceed 8% of the value  of  its
              activities and that a return is secured  on  its  capital  not
              less than the rate of inflation.


         *  Khula welcomed the fact that DTI plans to hive  off  funding  of
              survivalist enterprises to a new fund, saying this  will  help
              Khula to refocus its activities.


         *  Recapitalisation remains an issue for Khula, and  we  were  told
              that Khula will not be  able  to  achive  its  targets  unless
              further capital is obtained. We were told  that  of  the  R200
              million requested from DTI two years ago, Khula  received  R81
              million in 2000/1 and R30 million in 2001/2.  Of  the  funding
              requested  within  the  framework  of  its  current  five-year
              projection, we were told that Khula had received  R70  million
              from the DTI and that the re-valuation of some  properties  in
              its portfolio would add a further  R120  million.  No  further
              commitments have been made by the DTI.


     Comments


     The  committee  is  pleased  to  report  continued  progress   in   the
     management, presentation, and reporting on the  DTI's  budget.  In  our
     last year' s report, we noted that programmes were more closely aligned
     to the  major  activities  of  the  Department,  that  there  was  more
     effective financial reporting that better control systems were in place
     and  that  the  trend  evident  in  previous   years   of   significant
     understanding was being corrected. All  these  achievements  have  been
     carried over into this year's budget. In  addition,  we  now  have  the
     Department reporting to the Committee on the extent  to  which  it  has
     delivered on output targets.


     In our view the latter represents an important  step  forward  for  our
     Committee in terms of its monitoring and oversight of the  Department's
     work, as well as an important step  towards  effective  outcomes  based
     budgeting. The next challenges to take this process further are, in our
     view:


         *  To find a mechanism to present and discuss  with  the  Committee
              proposed  output  targets  ahead  of  their  presentation   in
              documents tabled at the time of the budget speech.


         *  To develop a coherent and  convincing  methodology  to  indicate
              the extent to which the output targets have  impacted  on  the
              identified outcome targets viz "to lead and facilitate  access
              to sustainable economic activity and empowerment for all South
              Africans through higher  level  of  investment  and  increased
              access to international markets for  South  African  products,
              and to create a fair, competitive and efficient  market  place
              for domestic and foreign enterprises as well  for  consumers".
              We were  told  that  during  the  course  of  this  year,  the
              Department hoped to put in place reporting systems that  would
              at least enable it to identify more clearly what proportion of
              its total funding was being deployed to support SMMEs.


     As indicated above, the Committee  found  that  in  general  there  was
     improved delivery in 2001/2 on the output  targets  identified.  A  few
     matters of concern were however,  identified  by  the  committee  these
     included
         *  Whether sufficient resources are being allocated to support  our
              team involved in the WTO negotiations. This is  not  a  simple
              matter. The cost of maintaining one person in Geneva is  equal
              to employing 6 persons at director level, and  the  Department
              has already deployed the previous Deputy Director  General  of
              International  Trade  to  head  the  team  in  Geneva,   while
              establishing a dedicated team  led  by  the  former  Minister-
              Counselor in Geneva in Pretoria. The Committee is nevertheless
              of  the  view  that  the  WTO  negotiations  are  of  critical
              importance and  pose  many  challenges.  We  look  forward  to
              engaging further with the Department on how these efforts  can
              be re-enforced in, including ways in which Parliament and  our
              Committee can assist in this regard.


         *  The time it is taking  for  the  National  Empowerment  Fund  to
              become operative. After  many  years,  the  NEF  has  at  last
              received some funding from the Department  and  IDC  to  cover
              operational expenses and to launch its venture  capital  fund,
              but the NEF Corporation's substantial capitalization  has  yet
              to take place. The Committee urges the  Department  to  ensure
              that this takes place expeditiously,  and  indicates  that  it
              will be seeking progress reports from relevant departments  in
              the near future.


         *   It  is  our  earnest  hope  that   the   recently   established
              Cooperatives  division  will  be  in  the   near   future   in
              consultation with stakeholders; devise  an  effective  support
              programme for cooperatives.


     The Provinces and Local Authorities


         *  The Department will be requested to  comment  on  the  issue  of
              provincial  transfers  indicated  above,  including   possibly
              extrapolating some figures in respect of individual  provinces
              by the time the Budget Vote debate takes place  in  the  NCOP.
              With the objective of strengthening the relationships  between
              the various economic  development  role  players,  nationally,
              provincially and locally,  we  would  also  be  interested  in
              receiving reports  quantitatively  measuring  the  employment,
              investment  and  economic  empowerment  impact,  as  well   as
              indicating successes and challenges in the  various  provinces
              and municipalities. We are aware that some of this information
              can only be supplied by MECs with regard  to  funds  generated
              from provincial revenue. In  this  respect,  we  call  on  the
              Minister to request these inputs from  MECs  via  the  Min-MEC
              process. MECs could also  be  instrumental  in  generating  an
              economic  status  report  from  local  authorities  in   their
              respective provinces. It is envisaged  that  the  NCOP  debate
              will provide a  useful  forum  for  MECs  to  deliver  initial
              reports this year, and more comprehensive  reports  in  coming
              years within the MTEF framework.
