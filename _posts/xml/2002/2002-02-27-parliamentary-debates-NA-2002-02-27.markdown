       diminished or stabilised;

  (4) calls on all South Africans who are committed to the wellbeing of our
       country to participate in Letsema, the ANC campaign of the year of
       the volunteer, which during this month focuses on safety and

[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move:

       the Standing Committee on Public Accounts;


  (2) further notes documents released by Dr Woods highlighting:


       (a)  substantive shortcomings in the JIT's arms probe report; and


       (b)  interventions in the committee's own efforts to probe the
           defence procurement;


  (3) expresses its gratitude to Dr Woods for his fiercely independent
       chairpersonship of Scopa;


  (4) calls on all role-players to recognise that Scopa is at a crossroads;

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the central feature of the Government's Aids policy is: ABC -
           Abstain; Be faithful; Condomise;


       (b)  condom week has come and gone;


       (c)  there is very little attention paid to use of the female condom;
           and

           their sex lives; and


  (2) calls on the Ministers of Health and of Trade and Industry to -


       (a)  promote production and distribution of female condoms in South
           Africa and to popularise their use; and


       (b)  ensure that these are made freely available to women at many
           public outlets and become as much part of our psyche as male
           condoms.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: ANC, the hon M G Buthelezi.

Mnr I J PRETORIUS: Agb Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek namens die
Nuwe NP op die volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisiediens en die Departement van Binnelandse
       Sake gelukwens met hulle aanslag op korrupsie in dié departement, wat
       gelei het tot die onlangse inhegtenisname van -


       (a)  'n Nigeriese burger wat na bewering paspoorte, huweliks- en
           sterftesertifikate vervals het; en


       (b)  ses amptenare van die Departement van Binnelandse Sake, asook 'n
           prokureur wat daarvan verdink word dat hy onwettige immigrante
           gehelp het om amptelike dokumente te verkry;


     2) daarvan kennis neem dat die Nuwe NP die daadwerklike optrede
        verwelkom en 'n beroep doen op die Departement van Binnelandse Sake
        en ander rolspelers om voort te gaan met proaktiewe stappe, totdat
        alle korrupsie in dié departement uitgewis is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Hon Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -
  (1) congratulates the South African Police Service and the Department of
       Home Affairs on their attack on corruption in the department, which
       led to the recent arrest of -


       (a)  a Nigerian citizen who allegedly falsified passports, marriage
           and death certificates; and


       (b)  six officials from the Department of Home Affairs, as well as an
           attorney who is suspected of helping illegal immigrants obtain
           official documents; and


  (2) takes note that the New NP welcomes this real action and appeals to
       the Department of Home Affairs and other role-players to continue
       taking proactive steps until all corruption in the department has
       been eliminated.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House:


  (1) notes that the Standing Committee on Public Accounts fulfils a vital
       oversight and accountability role within the South African Parliament
       and constitutional democratic order;


  (2) acknowledges that the historical successes of Scopa over a long
       period of time were the result of the unanimous commitment, sound
       financial management and governance by all the parties represented in
       Scopa;


  (3) expresses its concern that the emergence of overpowering partisan
       attitudes in the past year has resulted in a decrease in the quality
       and quantity of work generated by Scopa historically; and


  (4) calls on all parties to co-operate towards the restoration of Scopa
       as an integral parliamentary mechanism to ensure that taxpayer money
       is spent properly and responsibly.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Chairperson, on the next sitting day of the House I shall
move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the exciting plan to provide farmworkers from Haarlem in the
           Klein Karoo with shares worth R5 million in the Appelkloof
           farming company;


       (b)  that an additional 45 jobs will be created in the community; and


       (c)  that the French government has trained 20 Western Cape
           farmworkers in viticulture and also plans to open a wine academy
           in Cape Town;


  (2) believes that both these initiatives provide major empowerment
       opportunities for formerly marginalised farmworkers;


  (3) commends the French government and the farmers who own the Appelkloof
       farming company; and


  (4) hope that these projects will serve as examples to others who are
       able to contribute to the empowerment of South African farmworkers.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the President's attitude towards Parliament and its
           institutions; and


       (b)  that by not replying to those who took part in the debate, he is
           sending a signal to the world and other nations that African
           leaders may ignore their opposition, and those who voted for
           opposition parties.


  (2) calls on the President in future state of the nation addresses not to
       pay lip service in the national statement to his outreach to groups,
       but to start in Parliament by replying sensibly to the speeches of
       the Leader of the Opposition and other leaders who took part in the
       state of the nation debate.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis van die volgende
voorstel namens die AEB:


  Dat die Huis -


   (1)      sy misnoeë uitspreek met die optrede van die LUR van Gesondheid
         in Mpumalanga, me Sibongile Manana, wat die Superintendent van die
         Rob Ferreira Hospitaal in Nelspruit, Dr Thys von Mollendorff,
         ontslaan het bloot omdat hy getrou gebly het aan die eed van
         Hippokrates om te alle tye die belange van sy pasiënte op die hart
         te dra; en


  (2) kennis neem dat -


         (a)     in die lig van die President se oproep tot Letsema, dit
              ironies is dat Dr Von Mollendorff se groot sonde juis was dat
              hy 'n vrywillige burgerlike organisasie, die Greater
              Nelspruit Rape Intervention Project, wat hul dienste gratis
              aanbied, betrek het by die taak om gesondheid in sy hospitaal
              te bevorder;


           b) aangesien Dr Von Mollendorff afgedank is omdat hy volgens die
              LUR nie regeringsbeleid ten opsigte van HIV uitgevoer het
              nie, die President konsekwent sal wees deur óf die LUR te
              repudieer en Dr Von Mollendorff in sy pos te herstel, óf die
              Premier van Gauteng, mnr Mbhazima Shilowa, te ontslaan omdat
              hy ook afwyk van regeringsbeleid deur nevirapine aan pasiënte
              in alle staatshospitale beskikbaar te stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairman, I hereby give notice of the following motion on
behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its displeasure with the behaviour of the MEC for Health in
       Mpumalanga, Ms Sibongile Manana, who dismissed the superintendent of
       the Rob Ferreira Hospital in Nelspruit, Dr Thys von Mollendorff,
       merely because he remained true to the Hippocratic Oath, at all times
       to have the interests of his patients at heart; and


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  in the light of the President's call to Letsema, it is ironic
           that Dr Von Mollendorff's great sin was precisely that he
           involved a voluntary civil organisation, the Greater Nelspruit
           Rape Intervention Project, which offers its services free of
           charge, in the task to promote health in his hospital; and


       (b)  Dr Von Mollendorff was dismissed, according to the MEC, because
           he did not carry out the Government's policy with regard to HIV
           and requests that the President be consistent by either
           repudiating the MEC and reinstating Dr Von Mollendorff in his
           post, or dismissing the Premier of Gauteng, Mr Mbhazima Shilowa,
           because he is also deviating from the Government's policy by
           making nevirapine available to patients in all state hospitals.]

Ms N V CINDI: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  since 1994, R10 billion have been invested to allow more people
           to access electricity; and


       (b)  more than 70% of the population now have access to electricity;


  (2) believes that this remarkable achievement demonstrates the commitment
       of the ANC-led Government to create a better life for all; and


  (3) commends the Government for providing this important service to our
       people.

Mr R S NTULI: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:

  That the House -


  (1) notes that everyone has the right to a basic education;


  (2) further notes, with great concern, the irresponsible action by the
       local leadership of the Pan-Africanist Student Organisation, Paso,
       which forced principals to close schools indefinitely in Tsakane in
       Brakpan on the East Rand, thereby infringing on the fundamental right
       of thousands of learners to a basic education;


  (3) strongly condemns intimidation at schools as a means of resolving
       problems, because it is unlawful; and


  (4) urges the Gauteng Department of Education to resolve this crisis so
       that normal teaching and learning can be resumed without further
       delay.

[Applause.]
Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move on behalf
of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern that there are still a number of schools that
           refuse admission to children on account of fees and uniforms;
           and


       (b)  that the South African Schools Act lays down clear guidelines
           which forbid such practices; and


  (2) therefore calls upon the provincial Ministries to issue new
       directives to both school principals and governing bodies, and to
       take action against those who deliberately contravene the Act.

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that a landmark court case involving the use of child labour by
       farmers in the Western Cape led to a conviction of a farmer in Ceres
       on 12 February 2002;


  (2) believes that this conviction sends a clear signal about the
       commitment of the ANC and the Government to uphold the rights of
       children and abolish the exploitation and abuse of children on all
       farms; and


  (3) applauds all the concerned law enforcement officials for bringing the
       perpetrators to book.

[Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Chairperson, on behalf of the New NP I hereby give notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the arrest and denial of bail to members of Paso in connection
       with the disruption of education for the developmental liberation of
       youth in Tsakane on the East Rand and  Balfour in Mpumalanga;


  (2) accepts that -


       (a)  the use of necessary force by the police was vital in protecting
           themselves and the affected schools;


       (b)  affected school governing bodies continue to make decisions on
           school fees and payment schemes in a participatory manner; and


  (3) calls upon the PAC to confirm or deny that these incidents are part
       of a national strategy to take a destructive approach in dealing with
       the common challenges of youth development.

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that following hard on the heels of a recent increase in
       telephone rates, there is another increase in communication services
       fees, namely a 9% increase in postal services;


  (2) expresses its concern that these increases have a disastrous impact
       on the poor by making it more expensive for them to access
       communication services;


  (3) views this move by the postal services as extending the disparity
       between the haves and the have-nots;


  (4) further notes that this increase in tariffs may be in contravention
       of the Post Office's licence agreement; and


  (5) calls on the Government to intervene and ensure that the poor do not
       suffer further and that the consumer is protected.

Mr N B FIHLA: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern reports that the Kokstad Prison remains closed
       owing to irregularities surrounding issues of nonpayment of
       electricity, water and rates by the people of Kokstad;


  (2) recognises the intervention by the Department of Public Works through
       the establishment of a task team to resolve the problem amicably and
       speedily;


  (3) believes that a speedy resolution lies with the people of Kokstad and
       the spirit of the people's campaign, Vuk'uzenzele, which seeks to
       promote the involvement of the people in partnership with the task
       team; and


  (4) calls on the people of Kokstad to co-operate with the department's
       task team to resolve the impasse.

             NKOSI JOHNSON NOMINATED FOR WORLD CHILDREN'S PRIZE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the late Nkosi Johnson has been nominated posthumously for the
           World Children's Prize, sometimes known as the children's Nobel
           Prize;


       (b)  this is a great honour and recognition of his legacy as an
           international Aids activist; and


       (c)  this award will bring much needed funding to Nkosi's Haven for
           children of mothers with Aids; and


  (2) calls on all South Africans to pledge their support and vote for
       Nkosi so that more South African children can benefit from his
       legacy.

[Applause.]

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 17:22.

     (2)    Report of the Working Group on the African Union


        A. Introduction


         The President, in his address to the Joint Sitting of the Houses
         on 31 October 2001, indicated that Parliament had made important
         observations on the implementation of the Constitutive Act of the
         African Union. The President requested that members of Parliament
         elaborate on the problematic areas they identified, propose
         possible remedies and spell out what form the various organs
         mentioned in the Constitutive Act should take.


         On 16 November 2001 the National Assembly passed a resolution
         establishing a Working Group to consider the implementation of the
         Constitutive Act of the African Union.
         The Working Group is chaired by the Speaker (Dr F N Ginwala) and
         includes the Deputy Speaker (Ms B Mbete), Dr R H Davies, Adv J H
         de Lange, Ms F Hajaig, Dr P Z Jordan, Mr C W Eglin, Mr M F Cassim,
         Dr B L Geldenhuys, Mr W G Makanda.


         The Working Group met on 15 January 2002, 14 February 2002 and 27
         February 2002. The Working Group established a Planning Team to
         deal with detailed planning and technical matters. The Planning
         Team held its first meeting on 19 February 2002.


        B. Objects of the Working Group


         The brief of the Working Group is to consider how to make
         Parliamentary inputs into the implementation of the Constitutive
         Act of the African Union and suggest appropriate procedural
         mechanisms for doing so. Parliament should assist the South
         African government in its participation in the implementation of
         the African Union and the establishment of its structures. In
         carrying out this task, Parliament will need to consider the
         vision of the African Union, make recommendations on how to
         achieve that vision and also consider policy implications and the
         legal and constitutional issues arising from the Act including the
         institutional framework being created by it. To this end,
         Parliament will make recommendations on what form the various
         organs of the African Union should take, and on the protocols and
         relevant rules and regulations.


         C. Process


         In order to perform its task, the Working Group has mapped out the
         way forward as follows:


         1. A meeting of the Working Group with the Executive will take
              place before the end of February 2002. The purpose of the
              meeting is to discuss, among other things:


              (a) the vision of the African Union.


              (b) progress being made in preparing for the inauguration of
                  the African Union in July 2002.


              (c) the implementation of the Constitutive Act.


              (d) political considerations and implications for South
                  Africa.


              (e) participation in the African Union by other countries and
                  regional bodies.


              (f) the transition from the Organisation of African Union
                  (OAU) to the African Union (AU).


         2. In cooperation with the Africa Institute of South Africa, the
              Institute for Global Dialogue and the South African Institute
              for International Affairs, a seminar on the African Union has
              been scheduled for 1 and 2 March 2002 consisting of the
              Working Group, members of Parliament as well as
              representatives from government. The purpose of the seminar is
              to allow Members to deliberate on the African Union
              specifically and familiarise Members with the Union and the
              issues arising in the course of its establishment.


              The seminar programme is to cover the following areas:


              (a) an overview of the African Union.


              (b) a situation analysis.


              (c) the African Union and other African initiatives.


              (d) the constitution, powers and functions of organs of the
                  African Union.


              (e) implications of the Constitutive Act of the African Union.


         3. It is recommended that a Parliamentary Debate on the African
              Union be held in the current session in order to raise
              awareness among the South African public about issues
              pertaining to the African Union.


         4. Following the seminar, the Working Group will submit a further
              report on how Parliament should proceed and involve itself in
              the process of the implementation of the Constitutive Act.


         Report to be considered.

         [B 49A - 2001].


     Report to be considered.

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development on Study Tour
     to Britain, dated 31 October 2001:
     A.     Preamble


         A delegation from the Portfolio Committee on Social Development
         undertook a study tour to Britain from 20 to 29 July 2001. The
         multi-party delegation was led by the Chairperson of the
         Committee, Mr E Saloojee (ANC), accompanied by Mr M Masuta (ANC),
         Ms M Ramotsamai (ANC), Ms R Southgate (ACDP), Ms S Kalyan (DP),
         Prof L Mbadi (UDM), Ms Z Adhikari (Committee Secretary), Mr F
         Abrahams (Researcher) and Ms N Ahmed (Parliamentary Researcher).


     B.     Background


         The Committee and the Department were instrumental in advocating
         for the complete review and development of comprehensive childcare
         legislation for South Africa's children. This legislative review
         was underpinned by the belief that all children in this country
         should have a right to protection and promotion of human dignity.
         The SA Law Commission was tasked with this undertaking and
         mandated to premise their investigation on "the best interest of
         the child". The "best interest of the child", as reflected in the
         Constitution, 1996, and International Instruments like the UN
         Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on
         the Rights and Welfare of the Child, is the common thread in the
         development of comprehensive childcare legislation for South
         Africa. The SA Law Commission is finalising its legislative
         proposals.


     C.     Terms of reference


         The Committee undertook this study tour in preparation for the
         critical assessment of the legislative proposals and to make
         recommendations based on a thorough understanding of what should
         constitute the key provisions in comprehensive South African
         childcare legislation.


         Furthermore, the Committee wanted to evaluate proposed mechanisms
         to monitor the implementation of legislation and identify problems
         with implementation. This will, among others, assist the Committee
         in gaining understanding of what the budgetary implications are
         likely to be when implementing comprehensive legislation.
         Provisions for special family courts, child protection services
         and models of care were to be explored.


         Objectives of tour


         A consideration of international children's statutes indicated
         that a study tour to Britain would offer the Committee the most
         appropriate opportunity to realise the objectives of the tour.
         These objectives were to:


         1. Critically review the British Children's Act of 1989 and other
              relevant childcare legislation.
         2. Review legislative and policy measures that focus on protecting
              children in exceptionally difficult circumstances.


         3. Identify existing gaps in the current legislation that
              negatively impact on children enjoying full protection.


         4. Assess the ways in which the Children's Act is in line with the
              Convention on the Rights of the Child.


         5. Identify measures that have been put in place to facilitate
              oversight of the implementation of such legislation.


         6. Investigate partnerships between the government and children's
              rights activists in giving effect to legislative provisions to
              protect children.


         7. Identify intersectoral mechanisms at national, provincial and
              local level that facilitate the promotion and protection of
              children's rights.


         8. Evaluate ways in which all legislation that affects the
              Children's Act is in synergy, thus advancing children's
              rights.


         A brief consideration of the UK legislation affecting children is
         presented as the context within which discussions were conducted
         by the Committee.


     D.     British legislation


         Children's Act (1989)


         The Children's Act codified legislation affecting children, and
         enshrined the rights of children as well as adults'
         responsibilities toward them. The Act is fundamentally based upon
         the belief that children are generally best looked after within
         the family, with both parents playing a full part and without
         resorting to legal proceedings. If a child is removed from the
         family, however, or is subjected to court proceedings, the welfare
         of the child must be the paramount consideration. The Act
         therefore makes it a requirement that the child's wishes are heard
         before a decision regarding his or her future is made, and that
         proceedings that involve children, must be finalised with minimal
         delay.


         In terms of the Children's Act, a court may make a range of orders
         concerning the best interests of a child. However, the issue is
         approached from the "no-order presumption" premise, which means
         that it is assumed that parents should see a court application as
         a last resort when other options (including professional
         conciliation or mediation) have failed.


         Should the court make an order, this may include:
         1. A Parental Responsibility Order, which confers similar rights
              on an unmarried and married father.


         2. A Contact Order, which requires the person with whom the child
              lives to allow the child to visit or stay with the person
              named in the order, or for that person and the child to have
              contact with each other.


         3. A Residence Order, which stipulates where the child will live,
              but importantly, not to whom the child belongs. Where a
              residence order is made, the holder of the order cannot change
              the child's surname and neither can the child be removed from
              the UK without the written consent of all those with parental
              responsibility or by a court order.


         4. A Specific Issue Order/Prohibited Steps Order, which enables
              the court to make orders requiring specific actions (Specific
              Issues Order) to be taken or prohibiting certain steps
              (Prohibited Steps Order) being taken in respect of children.
              These orders are intended to safeguard the interests of the
              children where major issues of concern arise.


         5. Family Assistance Order, which provides short-term help to
              overcome any problems and conflict associated with separation
              or divorce. A Court Welfare Officer will normally supervise
              such an order.


         6. An Assessment, Care and Supervision Order, which provides for
              the courts to deal with situations in which children are, or
              may be, at risk of significant harm, and which makes it
              possible for Social Services to seek, through the courts,
              orders for assessment (including medical examinations) and
              Care and Supervision Orders.
         The Act further provides the framework for the delivery of a wide
         range of services and court-related proceedings, and makes
         statutory provision for the co-operation of different government
         agencies when the need to protect a child becomes apparent. This
         is done at local government level, where local authorities are
         required to prepare plans for the provision of children's services
         in their area and to keep those plans under review.


     E.     Additional legislative measures


         Despite the wide purport for the Children's Act of 1989, the
         government has had to introduce a number of other legislative
         measures to supplement this Act, and to define the
         responsibilities of different levels of government.


         1. Some more important changes


              (a) New powers for courts to add exclusion requirements to
                  interim care orders and emergency protection orders,
                  where domestic violence is an issue, and allowing the
                  child to remain at home but the violent person to be
                  removed.


              (b) Providing for certain orders under the Crime and Disorder
                  Act, 1998, to be made in family proceedings.


              (c) Linking the Family Law Act, 1996, with the Children's Act
                  by designating FLA applications as "family proceedings".


              (d) Extending the range of children who can qualify for advice
                  and assistance to those who are accommodated in health
                  authority settings.


              (e) The introduction of the Protection of Children's Act,
                  1999, in order to restrict the opportunities for those
                  with criminal records for offences against children to be
                  employed or considered for fostering, adoption or work in
                  certain settings with children.


              (f) Requiring local authorities to prepare plans for the
                  provision of children's services in their areas and to
                  keep those plans under review.


              (g) Requiring, through the Children's Act, 2000, that young
                  people who have been looked after by a local authority,
                  are assisted to move from care into living independently
                  in as stable a fashion as possible. To this end, the
                  Children's Act is amended by placing a duty on local
                  authorities to assess and meet the care and support needs
                  of children in care (aged 16 and 17) and children who
                  leave care, as well as those who were in care before
                  reaching the age of 18 years. The local authority will be
                  obliged to maintain contact with all its care leavers who
                  qualify for these new support arrangements, including
                  those aged 18 to 21 years, and beyond in some instances.


              (h) Enabling local authorities to offer new support to carers
                  to help them maintain their own health and well-being.
                  The Children's Act, 2000, gives local authorities the
                  power to supply certain services - services that help the
                  carer care for the person cared for - directly to carers
                  following assessment. Secondly, the Act empowers local
                  authorities to make direct payments to carers, while it
                  also gives local authorities a power to charge carers for
                  the services they receive.


         2. Quality protection programme


              In an important step to realise what is implicit in the
              Children's Act, eight comprehensive and outcome-focused
              objectives in respect of personal social services for children
              were published with the launch of the Quality protection
              programme in September and November 1998. In effect, they aim
              to expand on the meaning of safeguarding and promoting
              children's welfare and to strengthen some of the strategic
              planning underpinning the Act since its implementation.


              The eight objectives were to:


              (a) Ensure that children are securely attached to carers
                  capable of providing safe and effective care for the
                  duration of their childhood.


              (b) Ensure that children are protected from emotional,
                  physical and sexual abuse and neglect (significant harm).


              (c) Ensure that children gain maximum mileage from educational
                  opportunities, health care and social care.


              (d) Ensure that children cared for gain maximum life chance
                  benefits from educational opportunities, health care and
                  social care.


              (e) Ensure that young people leaving care, as they enter
                  adulthood, are not isolated, but participate socially and
                  economically as citizens.
              (f) Ensure that children with specific social needs arising
                  from disability or a health condition are living in
                  families or other appropriate settings in the community
                  where their assessed needs are adequately met and
                  reviewed.


              (g) Ensure that referral and assessment processes discriminate
                  effectively between different types and levels of needs
                  and production, and are timeously reported on.


              (h) Ensure that resources are planned and provided for at
                  levels that represent best value for money, and allow for
                  choice and different responses for different needs and
                  circumstances.


         3. Guidance


              Child protection services are governed by the Children's Act,
              1989. The Act provides a comprehensive framework for the care
              and protection of children. The Act also places a statutory
              duty on local authorities to act when any child has suffered,
              or is likely to suffer, significant harm. In the event that
              the child is, or is likely to be, experiencing significant
              harm, he or she is placed on a child protection register. A
              child protection plan is then developed and the child is
              assigned to a care worker. There are approximately 30 000
              children on child protection registers in Britain at any given
              time.


              The Children's Act, 1989, is accompanied by Guidance developed
              by the Department of Health, the Home Office and the
              Department for Education and Employment. This document intends
              to provide a national framework within which agencies and
              professionals at local level need to work collaboratively to
              promote children's welfare and protect them from abuse and
              neglect. It is addressed to those who work in the health and
              education services, the police, social services, the probation
              service, and others whose work brings them in contact with
              children and families. Furthermore, it applies to those
              working in the statutory and voluntary sectors. The
              information contained in this document:


              (a) Describes how actions to safeguard children fit within the
                  wider context of support to children and families.


              (b) Describes some of the ways to best operate child
                  protection processes.


              (c) Sets out the role and responsibilities of different
                  agencies and practitioners.


              (d) Outlines the way in which joint working arrangements
                  should be agreed upon, implemented and reviewed through
                  the mechanism of Area Child Protection Committees.


              (e) Sets out the processes that should be followed when there
                  are concerns about a child, and the action that must be
                  taken to safeguard and promote the welfare of children
                  who are suffering, or at risk of suffering, significant
                  harm.


              (f) Provides guidance on child protection in specific
                  circumstances, including children living away from home.


              Concept of significant harm
              The Children's Act, 1989, introduced the concept of
              significant harm as the threshold that justifies compulsory
              intervention in family life, in the best interest of the
              child. A court may only make a care order (committing the
              child to the care of the local authority) or supervision order
              (placing the child under the supervision of a social worker or
              probation officer) in respect of a child if it is satisfied
              that:


              *   the child is suffering, or is likely to suffer,
                significant harm; and


              *   the harm or likelihood of harm is attributable to a lack
                of adequate parental care or control.


              There are no absolute criteria on which to rely when judging
              what constitutes significant harm. Consideration of the
              severity of ill-treatment may include the degree and the
              extent of physical harm, the duration and frequency of abuse
              and neglect, the extent of premeditation, and the degree of
              threat and coercion.


              The Guidance document, entitled Working Together to Safeguard
              Children, is issued under the Local Authority Social Services
              Act, 1970, requires local authorities in their social service
              functions to act under the general guidance of the Secretary
              of State. As such, this document does not have the full force
              of statute, but should be complied with, unless local
              circumstances indicate exceptional reasons that justify a
              variation.


     F.     Reforms to youth justice system


         The UK government has also made some reforms to the youth justice
         system in an attempt to strengthen the link between that system
         and the protection of children, as contemplated in the Children's
         Act.


         The Crime and Disorder Act, 1998, establishes the prevention of
         offending as the principal aim of the youth justice system and
         places a statutory duty on all those working within the youth
         justice system to have regard to that aim. The Act provides a
         range of new interventions and punishments to help local
         communities and youth justice agencies take effective action to
         tackle youth crime.


         These include new powers to enable early, targeted intervention to
         deal with anti-social behaviour and to divert the very young from
         crime - local child curfew schemes to protect children under 10 in
         a particular area from getting into trouble.


         Under these powers, local authorities may apply to the Home Office
         to establish a local scheme which may, for example, form part of
         local crime and disorder strategies required under section 6 of
         the Act. This includes:


         1. Child safety orders, to provide targeted intervention with
              children under 10 at risk of getting into trouble.


         2. Anti-social behaviour orders, to deal with serious, but not
              necessarily criminal, anti-social behaviour by those aged 10
              and above.


         3. Empowering the police to remove truants to designated premises
              to allow the police, working with local authorities and
              schools, to tackle truancy, one of the factors that put young
              people at risk of committing offences.


         New structures at local and national level have been introduced to
         provide the framework to tackle youth offending. Youth offending
         teams will bring together the staff and wider resources of the
         police, social services, the probation service, education and
         health, in the delivery of youth justice services, with the scope
         to involve others, including the voluntary sector. At national
         level, the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales will provide
         oversight of the operation of the teams and the youth justice
         system.


         The Crime and Disorder Act also includes provision for setting
         statutory time limits for young offender and persistent young
         offender cases, as well as for adult cases. In addition to
         measures currently being piloted, the Act also introduced a range
         of other procedural changes specifically relating to the youth
         court.


         The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, 1999, introduce
         reforms that ensure effective intervention with first-time
         offenders, emphasising personal responsibility, reparation and the
         role of the family, friends and other responsible adults in
         addressing offending behaviour. Under these measures, first-time
         offenders who plead guilty and do not require a custodial sentence
         will be referred through a referral order to a panel drawn from
         the community and facilitated by the youth offending team. The
         panel will consider the causes of offending and draw up a contract
         with the young offender and their parents to address these.


     G.     Organisations


         The Committee met with the following organisations:


         1. State agencies


              (a) Juvenile Offender Unit


                  This office forms part of the Home Office and is
                  responsible for the planning of policies for juvenile
                  offenders.


              (b) Youth Justice Board


                  The Youth Justice Board is an executive non-departmental
                  public body, established under the Crime and Disorder
                  Act, 1998. The Board believes that the youth justice
                  system must aim to prevent offending by early
                  intervention in the lives of young people, effective
                  local systems, strong intervention by the Board where
                  local agencies are failing, and a co-ordinated approach
                  across government to tackle youth offending as a
                  priority.


                  The Board is responsible for:


                  *    Advising the Home Secretary on the operation of the
                    youth justice system in delivering its aim to prevent
                    offences by young people;


                  *    Monitoring operation and performance of the youth
                    justice system, including the youth court, the work of
                    the offending teams and the delivery of secure
                    accommodation;


                  *    Advising the Home Secretary on drawing up standards
                    for the work of youth offender teams and juvenile
                    secure estates, and monitoring and publishing
                    performance indicators;


                  *    Identifying and disseminating good practice,
                    including commissioning research and providing grants
                    for developing best practice.


                  The Youth Justice Board is responsible for reforming
                  conditions for young offenders in custody, and will
                  ensure that time is well spent so that when young persons
                  are released, they do not commit offences again.
                  Vulnerable young offenders will be placed in appropriate
                  institutions, as close to their homes as possible.


                  The new sentence for young offenders - the Detention and
                  Training Order - will mean that offenders serve their
                  sentences half in custody and half under the supervision
                  of the Youth Offender Teams in the community. The Youth
                  Justice Board believes that achieving continuity between
                  both elements is vital to preventing further offending.
                  Multi-agency Youth Offender Teams (Yots) look at the
                  causes of the offences and exercise oversight on sentence
                  requirements.


                  The system of restorative justice, which forms the basis
                  of the work of the Yots, is relatively new in the UK, and
                  is based on the premise that it is more beneficial to
                  society to order the offender to make reparations to the
                  victims of their offences than to send such young persons
                  to prison. The Yots must assess the youth and their
                  families, and within 15 days a community panel will be
                  established for the offending youth and victim to meet
                  and decide on reparation.


         2. NGOs/charities


              (a) Young Minds


                  This organisation has been dealing with children's mental
                  health issues for the past 10 years. Their work is based
                  on the philosophy that adults have the capacity to
                  stimulate children to enjoy good mental health. Their
                  manifesto lists the following issues:


                  *    Support for parents through a national transition to
                    a parenthood programme.


                  *    Help for schools to support children with mental
                    health problems.


                  *    Mental health services for young offenders and those
                    at risk of offending.


                  *    Comprehensive services to meet the needs of
                    adolescents.


                  *    Accessible, well co-ordinated emergency services for
                    young people.


                  *    Greater access to training for those who work with
                    children and young people.


                  *    Co-ordination across health, education and social
                    services.


                  *    The provision of well-staffed, specialist children's
                    mental health services.


                  *    Increased accountability for children's mental
                    health services.


                  *    An end to the postcode lottery of service provision.


                  The organisation believes that through lobbying it has
                  contributed to the launch of a government policy called
                  "Together We Stand", which covers various sectors. There
                  has been a move to understanding health as being more
                  than physical.


                  Critique of Children's Act


                  The Children's Act, with its emphasis on children's
                  rights and parental responsibility, has been an important
                  breakthrough in their work. However, the organisation is
                  concerned about the many children being left undiagnosed
                  and therefore untreated. Studies conducted suggest that
                  one in four children have a mental health problem, while
                  specialist services tend to reach only 900 000 throughout
                  the country. This means that the majority of children in
                  need of remedial care are not being catered for by the
                  health care system.


              (b) Family Rights Group


                  Solicitors, social workers and anti-poverty workers
                  formed this organisation 25 years ago, focusing on the
                  rights of the family. The organisation was involved in
                  the drafting of the Children's Act, and it feels very
                  strongly that the State should only intervene in families
                  if there is a clear indication that the child is in
                  danger. They also noted the link between poverty and
                  childcare problems within families.


                  The Family Rights Group works towards its aims by:


                  * Providing an advice and advocacy service for families.
                  *    Undertaking policy and research projects.


                  *    Producing a range of publications, including advice
                    materials for families and models of good practice.


                  *    Providing training and consultation for local
                    authorities and voluntary agencies.


                  *    Campaigning for changes in legislation, policy and
                    practice that support the concept of "working in
                    partnership".


                  Critique of Children's Act


                  While noting that the Children's Act is an example of
                  innovative legislation, this organisation expressed
                  reservations. The legislation needs to place children in
                  the context of their families, and the rights of families
                  must be respected. Similarly, the organisation feels that
                  there is an over-emphasis on child protection, which
                  gives social services strong investigative powers,
                  sometimes at the cost of the family. In addition, the
                  mechanisms to ensure partnerships between different arms
                  of government, service providers and families have not
                  been sufficiently developed.


         3. Children in Crisis


              This organisation targets four- to 11-year-olds with its drug
              education programme. They had previously worked with 11 to 18
              year olds, but had found the impact of their message reached
              this group too late. They have a holistic approach that
              focuses on social, health and personal development. Teachers
              are closely involved and are trained and provided with
              resources by Children In Crisis. In addition, they work
              directly with local authorities and social services.


              Internationally, they work in six countries where children are
              in crisis situations. These countries do not have legislation
              pertaining to children, but most have ratified the UNCRC.
              Their work in these countries is based on the rights set out
              in the UNCRC, while at the same time respecting the
              legislation and culture of those countries.


              Critique of Children's Act


              The organisation sees the Children's Act as enabling
              legislation, but feels that it still has some gaps, especially
              with regard to the issue of child soldiers. Children as young
              as 16 are able to enlist in the army, but are only considered
              majors at the age of 18 years. They feel this contravenes the
              UNCRC and international labour law.


         4. National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)


              This charity was established in 1884 and is the only
              organisation that has the right to remove children from their
              homes in the case of suspected abuse. They have a 24-hour
              helpline, which they run in conjunction with Childline. In
              addition, the NSPCC has a database of social services and is
              able to contact service providers directly.


              The organisation has gained public trust, as members of the
              public would rather contact the NSPCC than Social Services.
              They also conduct a range of professional and public awareness
              programmes about child protection, particularly in relation to
              parenting advice and the responsibility of the whole community
              for the care and safety of children.


              In 1999 the NSPCC launched a campaign, Full Stop, in
              collaboration with two other charities, Barnados and the Child
              Poverty Action Group. The organisation's Public Policy
              Department contributed to much of the thinking behind the
              Children's Act, and together with a consortium of 10
              organisations lobbied over the contents of the Family Law Act,
              1996. It has also campaigned extensively for changes to the
              criminal justice system.


              Among the amendments successfully lobbied for, was one in the
              Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act, 1996, which allows
              children to give evidence by video, including during cross-
              examination. The NSPCC was also a leading supporter of the
              Protection of Children's Act, 1999, which was developed to
              ensure that paedophiles were prevented from working with
              children. It requires childcare organisations in England and
              Wales to provide the Department of Health with details of
              anyone known to them who is suspected of harming children or
              putting them at risk.


         5. Barnados


              It is the UK's largest children's charity, supporting over
              50 000 children and their families through more than 300
              projects in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.


              Their belief is that the lives of all children should be free
              from poverty, abuse and discrimination, and they use their
              expertise and knowledge to campaign for better care for
              children and to champion for the rights of every child. Their
              work focuses on what they regard as the vital components that
              make for a happy, healthy childhood, under which a family can
              cope, protecting children from harm, providing for their
              emotional, physical and mental health needs, creating a sense
              of belonging in the community, and giving them opportunities
              to learn and take their rightful place in society.


              Barnados works with the most disadvantaged children to ensure
              that their vital needs are met. Although the organisation's
              history is closely tied to residential care, there is a strong
              feeling now that children are best cared for within the
              family. Homes require suitable staff that will benefit
              children and are relatively expensive to manage. Only in
              extreme cases are children institutionalised, and there are
              currently about 7 000 children in residential care. They feel
              that the opportunities for looked after children (a term used
              in Britain to refer to children looked after by the state need
              to be improved.


              Critique of Children's Act


              With reference to current children's legislation in the UK,
              Barnados noted that while the Children's Act gave some
              expression to the UNCRC, there were some provisions that were
              not adhered to, such as the status of asylum-seeking children
              and the aspect of corporal punishment. In general, however,
              they maintained that the Children's Act allowed for children
              to be seen as individuals with their own rights within the
              context of their families.


              The organisation believes that too much emphasis and resources
              are placed on the investigation of child abuse, and that more
              attention should be given to a resolution of emerging problems
              before a formal investigation. Furthermore, the sentiment was
              expressed that often children who are removed from abusive
              situations are exposed to abuse from incompetent and poorly
              trained staff in care institutions.


              The organisation expressed the sentiment that resources will
              be utilised more effectively in preventative programmes,
              rather than focusing too strongly on looked after children in
              the care system. The latter option is also considered a very
              expensive one.


         6. Children's Society


              The Children's Society works throughout England and Wales on
              over 100 projects, aiming to build safer communities and
              seeking to develop them. They focus on projects that are not
              covered by government policies, such as the effect of domestic
              violence on children.


              The organisation concentrates its resources on tackling the
              root causes of the problems these children and young people
              face. Their Social Policy Unit collaborates with MPs,
              Ministers and departments, as well as professional networks,
              to research and advise on key issues of concern to children
              and young people. These issues cover broad policy areas such
              as children's health, children's rights and participation,
              poverty, social exclusion and youth justice. The Social Policy
              Unit is currently operative in the following areas:


              (a) Children's Fund: This fund is part of the governments'
                  strategy to tackle child poverty and social exclusion,
                  and aims to provide additional resources to complement
                  the work of mainstream services or specific initiatives.


              (b) Children's Rights: The organisation is writing a report,
                  asking children and young people what they think about
                  their rights in England and Wales.


              (c) Child Poverty: This is addressed through campaigning and
                  lobbying, both as an individual organisation and as part
                  of the End Child Poverty Coalition.


              (d) Young Runaways: The organisation has campaigned for the
                  rights of children who run away from, or are forced to
                  leave, home or substitute care. They are currently
                  working with the government on developing a national
                  strategy for the UK's 100 000 young runaways.


              (e) Health: The Social Policy Unit, together with a consortium
                  of charities, have produced an analysis of Health
                  Improvement Programmes across England to assess the
                  impact of the emphasis being placed on children and young
                  people's health.


              (f) Youth Justice System: The Children's Society is working to
                  make the youth justice system more child-focused and more
                  effective at solving the problems of youth crime.
                  According to Tough Justice, a recent report on young
                  people in prison produced by The Children's Society, over
                  half of all young people in prison have a diagnosable
                  mental illness. The report calls for an immediate end to
                  remand in custody for 15- and 16-year-olds and a
                  reappraisal of the policy of incarcerating children and
                  young people in trouble with the law. The Children's
                  Society opposes all use of prison custody for persons
                  younger than 18.


              Critique of Children's Act


              While the children's legislation sets the framework, the
              organisation believes that the manner in which the Act is
              operationalised, may not deal effectively with the problems.
              While they recognise the need for statutory interventions,
              they emphasise the importance of community involvement, as
              members of the community have more intimate contact with
              children than professionals. The organisation therefore
              acknowledges the importance of working with communities and
              other agencies to protect children and young people from harm
              and to promote their welfare.


         7. National Children's Homes (NCH)


              The NCH was founded in 1869, and run over 460 projects in the
              UK, supporting more than 89 000 children at risk, vulnerable
              young people and families in need of support.


              Although the NCH believes that children are best cared for by
              their families, for some children this is not possible, and
              therefore the organisation offers a range of alternatives.
              They run a few small residential homes, where each child has
              an individual care plan that focuses on their individual
              needs. They are also registered as an adoption agency and find
              foster and adoptive families for hundreds of children each
              year. In addition, they run specialist education services for
              children, which follow the national curriculum.


              The NCH was one of the first charities to set up a network of
              projects, offering therapeutic support for sexually abused
              children and their non-abusing relatives. Their children's
              rights services encourage children to speak out about the
              services they receive and the issues that affect their lives.


              In the same way as the other charities, the NCH lobbies
              government about its policies and proposed legislation. These
              interventions range from conferences around an issue to
              submissions to select committees, expert briefings and
              advocacy work. They also focus on making their opinion heard
              by individual MPs.


              Critique of Children's Act


              When looking at the Children's Act and considering whether it
              adequately addresses the UNCRC and children's rights, the NCH
              feels that while the legislation sets sound principles, the
              "Quality Protects" document specifies the foundations for the
              realisation of children's rights. They note that guidelines
              are often taken less seriously than legislation, are open to
              interpretation and will vary, depending on the area in which
              people live. A further comment was that the principle that
              children's rights be paramount, should be extended to all
              other legislation that affects children.


              The NCH further feels that the legislation does not adequately
              address the needs of poor children - children in need, as
              contemplated in section 17 of the Children's Act. The
              organisation therefore devotes the bulk of its services to
              supporting family life and helping children to reach their
              full potential, especially in the context of families who face
              social exclusion through poverty. The NCH's family centres
              offer parenting skills, playing and development opportunities
              for their children. Their community centres provide a
              community network, advice and, in some cases, credit unions
              and food co-operatives, all of which attempt to place a strong
              emphasis on preventative work with families at risk.


     H.     Implications for South Africa


         In considering the content and merits of the discussions held with
         the different organisations, the Committee has identified numerous
         issues that must be considered in view of forthcoming legislative
         proposals from the SA Law Commission. Some of the issues include
         principles that must inform the development of legislation, while
         others address provisions that must give effect to the identified
         principles. Financial considerations also merit special attention,
         as this issue was consistently raised by all the organisations
         working in the areas of children's rights and protection.


         1. Issues for consideration


              (a) Principles


                  *    It is important to consider the weight that is
                    attached in a children's statute to the issue of child
                    protection and statutory intervention. While this is
                    clearly a critical area, due consideration must be
                    given to promoting and supporting healthy children and
                    their families. Thus, there must also be a focus in
                    legislation on prevention and early intervention
                    activities. In giving effect to the Convention on the
                    Rights of the Child, national legislation must be
                    comprehensive insofar as it gives effect to all the
                    rights that children must enjoy.


                  *    A strong emphasis on child protection and statutory
                    intervention is likely to result in large numbers of
                    children being in the care system. Cognisance must be
                    given to research in Britain, that highlights that
                    children in care have consistently poorer outcomes than
                    those not in care. These apply to social, emotional,
                    health and education indicators. Consideration must be
                    given to such research findings in evaluating
                    legislative proposals.
                  *    It is necessary to ensure that the principle of
                    "children first" must inform all legislation that
                    affects children. Consideration must be given to the
                    way in which comprehensive childcare legislation will
                    facilitate this principle being operationalised and
                    given effect to in other legislation that affects
                    children.


                  *    The need to extend existing legislation to include
                    young people up to the age of 21 years. There is a need
                    in legislation to protect individuals who want to
                    continue with their studies in their quest to become
                    mature and responsible adults. Particular attention
                    must be given to children in care whose activities may
                    exceed those that are appropriate for their age.
                  *    Careful consideration must be given in legislation
                    to duties conferred and powers given to those agencies
                    tasked with child protection. The rights of the child
                    to protection, support and development must inform
                    these decisions.


                  *    It is necessary to duly consider those provisions
                    that are included in the statute, and those in
                    regulations. Furthermore, where intersectoral roles and
                    responsibilities are delineated, it may be worthwhile
                    to include these in the legislation, as it places
                    statutory responsibilities on the responsible agencies.


                  *    Children's protection and the establishment of their
                    well-being has historically been considered the
                    preserve of the social development sector. It must be
                    recognised that all sectors must support children's
                    development, as this is integral to human development.
                    Due consideration must be given to the duties that all
                    government departments have in being responsive to the
                    needs of children, as they traverse all sectors. It may
                    be necessary in a children's statute to consider
                    placing statutory responsibilities on government
                    departments to develop policies and programmes that
                    target the protection and well-being of children.


                  *    While the law is able to establish a framework for
                    the protection and development of children,
                    consideration must be given to the ways in which this
                    framework is applied in practice. This includes
                    mechanisms for implementation as well as censure where
                    children's rights are violated. Consideration must
                    therefore be given to the institutional arrangements
                    that can facilitate good practice in respect of
                    children.


                  *    In giving effect to the principle of participation
                    by children in decisions that affect their lives,
                    careful thought must be given to the ways in which such
                    participation is facilitated and implemented.


              (b) General Provisions


                  *    Very careful consideration must be given to the most
                    suitable implementing agencies rendering services to
                    children and their families. British practice has
                    established local authorities as the most appropriate
                    vehicle for delivery, as it is at the local level that
                    resources can be mobilised to effect intervention and
                    prevention in children's lives. It is also at this
                    level that maximum effect can be given to the principle
                    of intersectoral collaboration.


                  *    Thought has to be given to the family as the context
                    in which many children live. There may thus be a need
                    to consider the provision of family services within the
                    statute. There is an inherent danger in legislation
                    that is very strongly focused on child protection, to
                    pay less attention to the family.


                  *    It is necessary to undertake a thorough review of
                    all legislation affecting children, as well as
                    envisaged provisions in the legislative proposals that
                    will have an impact on other sectoral responsibilities.
                    Careful consideration must be given to such provisions,
                    as the principle children's statute must bear direct
                    relevance to all other provisions that affect children.




                  *    In establishing family courts, it is necessary to
                    ensure that one judge presides over all proceedings
                    affecting children, as such consistency is important in
                    developing the trust of children and their families in
                    the judicial process.


                  *    Attention has to be paid in legislation to the issue
                    of kinship placements. Specific discussions need to
                    consider what role the State should play in supporting
                    relatives who are looking after children. The form that
                    such State support should take, also requires due
                    consideration.


                  *    On the issue of adoption, discussions must be
                    conducted that focus on the role of adoption in social
                    development policy - specifically, the conventional
                    practice of adoption as a placement option for a child
                    who may be in need of care. It must be considered
                    whether the practice of severing biological ties may
                    not be misguided, as such severance may in fact not be
                    in the best interest of the child. It has been
                    suggested that children form lasting familial
                    attachments, and severing these do more harm than good.
                    Severing of biological ties must be interrogated in
                    respect of whose best interest is being served in
                    severing such ties.


                  *    With regard to implementation, it is necessary to
                    review the current service delivery paradigm operative
                    within the domain of children's services. It may be
                    necessary to consider a mix of social service delivery,
                    including the voluntary sector, without undue
                    dependence on the statutory sector. Such provisions are
                    directly related to a well-defined balance between
                    preventative and promotive services, and statutory
                    intervention in the lives of children and families.


                  *    In view of South Africa's policy focus on family
                    preservation, it may be advisable to consider the
                    issues of parenting skills as a mandatory requirement
                    in all programmes targeting children and families. This
                    should apply to the State and the voluntary sector.


                  *    It may be worth considering the emphasis in British
                    legislation on partnerships in endeavouring promoting
                    children's rights. Such partnerships may include the
                    different levels of government, as well as those with
                    the not-for-profit and private sectors as well as
                    communities.


                  *    Given the current realities of poverty and HIV and
                    AIDS, legislative provisions must attempt to challenge
                    and address conventional practices in the area of
                    childcare, as well as conventional models of care.
                    Practice needs to be guided by the best interest of the
                    child, in the context of material conditions that exist
                    in this country.


              (c) Financial Considerations


                  *    Envisaged children's legislation must be thoroughly
                    costed before enactment, as cost determines the success
                    of implementation. A cost-benefit analysis may also be
                    very appropriate in this regard.


                  *    Any children's legislation needs to be adequately
                    resourced to ensure that it is fully implementable.
                    Lack of resources can seriously undermine the impact of
                    the most well-intended legislation.


                  *    Resources must be allocated to preventative and
                    promotive initiatives in the lives of children and
                    families. With a strong focus on child protection,
                    resources can quite easily be targeted at state
                    intervention and subsequent residential care
                    activities. The British experience indicates that money
                    spent in the care system seems not to be yielding
                    expected benefits, as children in the care system
                    generally have poorer outcomes.
