Dr S J GOUS: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem -


  (1) van die Hooggeregshof se uitspraak dat die regering  anti-retrovirale
       middels aan alle MIV-positiewe swanger vroue  by  staatshospitale  op
       aanvraag moet verskaf;


  (2) dat die uitspraak onmiddellik tot uitvoer gebring  moet  word  ongeag
       die regering se appèl na die Konstitusionele Hof;


  (3) dat dit die lewens van ten minste 100 babas op 'n dag kan red;


  (4) dat dit die voorkoms  van  MIV/Vigs  in  Suid-Afrika  aansienlik  kan
       verminder; en


  (5) dat die Nuwe NP die  verskaffing  van  anti-retrovirale  middels  ten
       volle ondersteun en 'n beroep op die regering doen  om  hulle  beleid
       sodanig aan te pas. Dit is lankal nie meer  'n  opsie  nie,  maar  'n
       noodsaaklikheid.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)
[Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice:


  That the House notes -


  (1) the judgment by the Supreme Court that the  Government  must  provide
       antiretroviral drugs on demand to all HIV-positive pregnant women  at
       state hospitals;


  (2) that the judgment must be carried out immediately irrespective of the
       Government's appeal to the Constitutional Court;


  (3) that it can save the lives of at least 100 babies in one day;


  (4) that it can significantly decrease the incidence of HIV/Aids in South
       Africa; and


  (5) that the New NP fully supports the provision of antiretroviral  drugs
       and appeals to the Government to adjust their  policy  accordingly  -
       for a long time it has not been an option, but a necessity.]
Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting  day  of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Mbeki  promised  last  year  that  a  commission
       investigating the electoral system in South Africa, headed by Mr  Van
       Zyl Slabbert, would soon be appointed;


  (2) further notes that  this  commission  has  yet  to  be  appointed  or
       provided with terms of reference;


  (3) supports mechanisms that make public representatives more accountable
       to their voters and hence  supports  the  idea  of  a  version  of  a
       constituency-based electoral system;


  (4) acknowledges that the next elections are less than two years away and
       that changes to the electoral system  will  have  to  be  implemented
       before that time; and
  (5) urges Government to appoint and provide terms of reference to the Van
       Zyl Slabbert Commission as a matter of urgency, in the  interests  of
       free and fair elections in 2004.

Mr R J B MOHLALA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the report that the South African Post Office will  pump  close
       to  R45  million  into  the  upgrading  of  rural  post  offices  and
       underserviced areas;


  (2) believes that this will result  in  improved  post  office  services,
       especially in the rural areas; and


  (3) welcomes the announcement made by Post Office Senior General Manager,
       Mr Bernard Magabe, as this will bring these post offices to the  same
       standards as those in urban areas.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker,  hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  sal
voorstel:


  Dat die Huis daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1) President Mbeki tydens 'n geleentheid waar spesiale  toekennings  aan
       sportmanne en -vroue gemaak is, gesê het dat Suid-Afrikaners vir  die
       volgende paar jaar nederlae van  nasionale  spanne  moet  aanvaar  in
       belang van die groter doel, naamlik die rassetransformasie van sport;


  (2) hierdie uitlating van die  President  'n  uiters  negatiewe  boodskap
       uitstuur na alle nasionale spanne, afrigters en sportadministrateurs,
       wat tans juis 'n laagtepunt beleef wat prestasie betref, en  wat  dit
       ook  'n  bespotting  maak  van  internasionale  sport  waaraan  Suid-
       Afrikaanse spanne deelneem;


  (3) die regering eerder moet toesien dat alle sportmanne  en  -vroue  van
       alle bevolkingsgroepe ongehinderd en met gelyke geleenthede  aan  die
       sport van hul  keuse  kan  deelneem,  om  sodoende  te  verseker  dat
       spankeuses op grond van verdienste  gemaak  word  en  dat  die  beste
       beskikbare span dus in elke sport Suid-Afrika verteenwoordig; en


  (4) die Vryheidsfront 'n beroep doen op alle Suid-Afrikaanse  sportspanne
       om nie nederlae te aanvaar in belang van rassetransformasie nie, maar
       om eerder daarna te streef om deur top  prestasies  te  verseker  dat
       Suid-Afrika steeds as een  van  die  top  sportlande  in  die  wêreld
       gereken sal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[P J GROENEWALD:  Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House takes note that -


  (1) at an occasion where special awards were presented to  sportsmen  and
       sportswomen, President Mbeki said that South Africans  should  accept
       defeats from national teams for the next few years in  the  interests
       of the greater aim, namely the racial transformation of sport;


  (2) this remark from the President is sending a negative message  to  all
       national  teams,  coaches  and  sport  administrators,  who  are  all
       currently experiencing a low with regard to performance,  which  also
       makes this a mockery of international sport in  which  South  African
       teams take part;


  (3) the South African government should rather ensure that all  sportsmen
       and sportswomen of all the population groups are able to take part in
       the  sport  of  their  choice  without  hindrance  and   with   equal
       opportunity, to consequently ensure that team choices can be made  on
       the basis of merit and that the best available team  could  therefore
       represent South Africa in every sport;


  (4) the Freedom Front appeals to all South African sports  teams  not  to
       accept defeat in the interest of racial transformation, but rather to
       strive, through top achievement, to ensure that South Africa is still
       respected as one of the top sporting countries in the world.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, your one minute is up. You only  have
one minute, and hon members know that.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of the fact that the Commonwealth  failed  at  its  recent
       conference to come out strongly on the side of human rights  and  the
       rule of law;


  (2) deprecates this failure of leadership; and


  (3) calls on the leaders of the Commonwealth to think again,  because  if
       this organisation remains quiet in the face  of  gross  human  rights
       abuses, it can serve no useful  purpose  for  the  people  of  member
       countries.

Ms P N MNANDI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  Telkom's  foreign  partner,  Thintana,  has  donated  R30
       million for teaching and training resources at 200 schools and at  18
       new science and technology centres;


  (2)  further  notes  that  this  grant  is  targeting  200   historically
       disadvantaged schools and is meant to drastically improve performance
       in maths and science related programmes; and


  (3) welcomes the grant made by Thintana as this will -
       (a)  drastically increase the supply of  workers  with  technological
           skills required by a growing economy; and


       (b)  further lead on  an  increase  in  much-desired  foreign  direct
           investment.

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) regrets President Mbeki's view that ``South  Africans  should  accept
       losing international sporting competitions in the interests of racial
       transformation'';


  (2) recognises that the fighting spirit of Makhaya Ntini and  Paul  Adams
       in  the  cricket  test  against  Australia  demonstrate  that  talent
       transcends skin colour; and


  (3) urges the Government to encourage a winning culture in South  Africa,
       instead of undermining it, by supporting the efforts of sports bodies
       to identify and develop talent  amongst  young  black  sportsmen  and
       women so that they can compete with the best in the world.

Mr M A MZIZI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the international standards used  by  the  Department  of  Water
           Affairs and Forestry for  recreational  water  state  that  such
           water should contain a maximum of 150 faecal coliforms  per  100
           ml sample;


       (b)   a  sample  taken  from  the   Jukskei   River   near   Wynberg,
           Johannesburg, in February  2002  contained  2,8  million  faecal
           coliforms per 100 ml; and


       (c)  the count at other points along the river ranged between 700 and
           300 000 faecal coliforms per 100 ml; and


  (2) calls on the relevant national, provincial and local  authorities  to
       urgently address the state of water in  rivers  around  Johannesburg,
       Gauteng.

Ms E NGALEKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Government plans to amend the Films  and  Publications
       Act and to tighten child pornography  laws  to  make  it  easier  for
       authorities to act against those caught viewing such images;


  (2) believes that there is a direct link between  pornography  and  child
       abuse cases, as many people who view these materials  tend  to  abuse
       children; and


  (3) welcomes the  announcement  made  by  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Home
       Affairs, hon Charles Nqakula, as this will play a significant role in
       minimising cases of child abuse.

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Mev die Speaker, hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met ontsteltenis kennis neem van die grootskaalse sindikaatbedrog wat
       in die Padongelukkefonds oopgevlek is;


  (2) meen dat die skuldiges  sonder  aansien  des  persoons  aan  die  man
       gebring en vervolg moet word; en


  (3)  die  Minister   van   Vervoer   versoek   om   nou   die   politieke
       verantwoordelikheid te neem en toe te sien dat kundigheid vanuit  die
       privaatsektor aangewend word om die finansiële bestuur sowel  as  die
       administrasie van die Fonds oor die interimtermyn te behartig  totdat
       die verslag van die regterlike kommissie  oor  die  bestuur  van  die
       Fonds ter tafel gelê is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay the  large-scale  syndicate  fraud  that  has  been
       exposed in the Road Accident Fund;


  (2) is of the  opinion  that  the  guilty  parties  must  be  caught  and
       prosecuted, without fear or favour; and


  (3)  requests  the  Minister  of  Transport   now   to   take   political
       responsibility and see to it that expertise from the  private  sector
       is utilised to  handle  the  financial  management  as  well  as  the
       administration of the Fund in the interim until  the  report  of  the
       judicial commission on the management of the Fund is tabled.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, on the next sitting day of the House  I  shall
move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the judgment in the Pretoria High Court yesterday  that  effect
       be  given  to  its  earlier  ruling  that  the  antiretroviral   drug
       Nevirapine be given more widely to HIV-positive pregnant women;


  (2) further notes that the  major  obstacle  remains  political  and  not
       administrative or medical;


  (3) calls on the Minister of Health to dispel any  rumours  regarding  an
       appeal by her department and to change national policy guidelines  so
       that they are in line with  this  judgment,  thereby  benefiting  all
       South Africans; and


  (4) further calls on President Mbeki to stop wasting time while thousands
       of people die and to heed the advice of Madiba.

Mr Q J KGAUWE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day  of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  reports  that  the  MEC  for  Community  Safety,  Mr  Leonard
       Ramatlakane, will conduct a survey to determine  the  kind  of  cases
       that are reported at police stations;


  (2) further notes that surveys are aimed at improving service delivery in
       the area of safety and security;


  (3) believes that the move by the MEC for Safety and Security, Mr Leonard
       Ramatlakane, reflects the commitment of his  department  and  of  the
       provincial government in  improving  service  delivery  for  all  the
       people of the Western Cape;


  (4) welcomes the survey which the Department of Safety  and  Security  is
       embarking on; and


  (5) hopes that this will contribute positively to fighting crime  in  the
       province.

                      CONGRATULATIONS TO MIRIAM MAKEBA

           the Swedish government in  recognition  of  her  achievement  in
           music;


  (2) believes that Miriam Makeba played an important role in  raising  the
       awareness of the international community about the  struggle  of  the
       people of South Africa for freedom, peace and security; and


  (3) congratulates ``Mama Africa'' on this historic achievement and wishes
       her many happy returns.

[Applause.]

Agreed to.

           years ago that it has been won by a South African; and

                      SOCIAL GRANTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker,  hon  members,  in  the  President's
state of the nation address on 8 February, as well as in the  Budget  Speech
of 20 February, reference was made to the need to support the Department  of
Social Development and provinces  to  deal  with  arrears  in  social  grant
payments which developed over the past three years.

The relevant arrears developed  because  provinces  implemented  regulations
that we have  now  agreed  are  inequitable  and  which  led  to  a  set  of
inappropriate incentives in  the  administration  of  social  pensions.  The
implementation of the regulations had the effect that  poor  South  Africans
who qualified for  grants  only  received  payment  from  the  date  of  the
approval of grants and not from the date that they  applied  and  qualified.
Where  there  were  delays  in  processing  and  approval  of  grants,  poor
beneficiaries were not always paid for the period of delay.  This  certainly
had severe negative effects on many poor households.

The relevant regulations in terms of the Social Assistance Act,  1992,  have
now been amended with effect  from  December  2001,  with  the  result  that
beneficiaries are entitled to payment from the date of application, if  they
qualified on that date, and where there are delays in payment they  will  be
entitled to payment for the period of the delay.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, could you please listen to  the  hon
the Minister.
The MINISTER: Government has, however, agreed that it is not  sufficient  to
change the situation as we move forward and has  acknowledged  its  debt  to
those grant beneficiaries who qualified for  grant  payments  between  April
1998 and December 2001. These people, about, 1,8 million who  qualified  for
grants for the first time during that period, have  to  be  compensated  for
the lapse of time between the application and approval.

The payment of  these  arrears  is  estimated  to  cost  provincial  welfare
departments around R2 billion. This provides for current active cases,  that
is, people still receiving grants,  inactive  and  lapsed  cases,  and  some
administrative expenditure. Provinces cannot be expected to foot  this  Bill
from their equitable share as they implemented regulations as they stood  in
good faith,  and  therefore  did  not  make  budgetary  provision  for  what
subsequently became arrears owing.

The Social Grants Appropriation Bill  of  2002  therefore  provides  for  R2
billion to be allocated to the national Department of Social Development  to
dispose of this matter.  The  funding  will  flow  from  the  department  to
provinces as a conditional grant to be used  to  implement  payment  of  the
arrears. Based on further verification of  arrears  owed  by  the  different
provinces, the amounts to flow to the different  provinces,  and  conditions
in this regard, will be gazetted in terms of the Division  of  Revenue  Act,
2001.

The Bill therefore makes good  Government's  undertaking  to  do  the  right
thing in this case and to be  sensitive  to  the  plight  of  the  poor  and
vulnerable. An implementation plan is currently  being  finalised  and  more
details about payments will be communicated soon. It should be  acknowledged
that the payment of these arrears is a  mammoth  undertaking  -  R2  billion
exceeds the normal monthly benefit payments - and that  to  do  this  right,
without disruption of normal  processes  and  without  negative  effects  on
beneficiaries, will require careful planning which will take some time.  Our
commitment to pay, and the funding to effect this,  is  made  clear  through
the Social Grants Appropriation Bill.
Our ability to make these payments derives from our success in  establishing
a sound and sustainable fiscal  framework,  and  from  improvements  in  tax
administration. We cannot, in future, expect  to  be  in  such  a  fortunate
position again. And, in future, such unplanned impositions  will  impact  on
the delivery of other services. The President  has  indicated  clearly  that
administrative failure, which, in addition  to  its  harsh  effect  on  poor
South  Africans  causes  budgetary  uncertainty  and  has  service  delivery
implications in other areas, cannot and will not be tolerated.

I hereby table the Social Grants Appropriation Bill, 2002. [Applause.]

Bill, together with the  introductory  speech,  referred  to  the  Portfolio
Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

                BURUNDI PROTECTION SUPPORT APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, generally funds  from  the  National
Revenue Fund are appropriated in the annual Budget at the beginning of  each
financial  year.  In  cases  that  warrant  adjustment  to   budgets,   such
adjustment may be presented  to  Parliament,  usually  during  September  or
October of the relevant financial year.

However, the national legislature accepted that there could be urgent  cases
where the general budget process would  be  too  restrictive.  In  terms  of
section 16 of the Public Finance Management Act of  1999,  the  Minister  of
Finance was therefore empowered to authorise  the  use  of  funds  from  the
National Revenue Fund to defray expenditure of an exceptional  nature  which
is not provided for and which  cannot,  without  serious  prejudice  to  the
public interest, be postponed to a  future  parliamentary  appropriation  of
funds.

The more  pertinent  limitations  to  this  power  are,  firstly,  that  the
combined amount of any such authorisations may not exceed 2%  of  the  total
amount appropriated in the annual national Budget for the current  financial
year; secondly, that the amount authorised must be  reported  to  Parliament
and to the Auditor-General, usually within 14  days,  but  in  the  case  in
question, within a period determined by the  President  as  the  funds  were
required for the deployment of the security  services;  and,  thirdly,  that
the expenditure must be included in  appropriation  legislation  within  120
days of the date that the expenditure was authorised.

In terms of the UN Security Council Resolution 1286, of  January  2001,  the
appointment of former President Nelson Mandela as a new facilitator  of  the
Arusha peace and reconciliation process to achieve a  peaceful  solution  to
the conflict in Burundi was strongly supported.

South Africa was accordingly requested to contribute military  personnel  to
perform protection tasks  for  the  returning  exiled  leaders,  before  the
inauguration  of  the  interim  government  in  Burundi.  A  memorandum   of
understanding was signed with the  Burundi  government.  The  President,  in
terms of the powers vested in him by the Constitution and the  Defence  Act,
on  26  October  2001,  authorised  the  deployment  of  protection  support
services to returning opposition leaders participating in  the  transitional
government in Burundi. The deployment of 701 troops commenced on 28  October
2001.

Funds for the  deployment  were  not  provided  for  in  the  Department  of
Defence's budget. On 12 February this year, in terms of  the  powers  vested
in me by section 16(1) of the Public Finance Management  Act,  I  authorised
the use of an amount not exceeding R130 million for the Burundi  deployment.
This allocation was announced in the Budget  Speech  made  on  20  February.
This  dedicated  appropriation  Bill  is  therefore  required  to  put   the
Department  of  Defence  in  a  position  to  deal  with   this   unexpected
expenditure.

Despite initial  indications  that  Ghana,  Senegal  and  Nigeria  would  be
involved in providing additional troops, it is  not  anticipated  that  this
will realise in the near future. The Department of  Defence  will  therefore
be involved in this operation for the best part of the new fiscal  year,  at
least for eight months. However, the actual duration of  the  deployment  is
dependent on the effective functioning of the  transitional  government  and
the progress of the peace process.

Reports from Burundi indicate that the members of the SANDF have  been  well
received by the local population. This  has  created  the  possibility  that
South Africa might be requested to provide  additional  protection  support,
should the need arise.

The projected expenditure for the current fiscal year will amount to  R129,7
million, made up of personnel allowances, equipment and facilities,  medical
consumables  and  equipment,  sustainment  and   aircraft   chartering   and
transporting. An amount of R270 million has been  allocated  in  the  budget
for  the  new  fiscal  year  to  finalise  the  project.  The  international
community has made pledges amounting to R266 million, of which  R17  million
has been received. Agreements with  the  European  Union,  Belgium  and  the
Netherlands have been finalised, while the agreement with the UK  is  at  an
advanced stage. The USA is also considering making a contribution either  in
cash or in kind. Any funds received will  be  deposited  into  the  National
Revenue Fund.

I hereby introduce the Burundi Protection Support Appropriation Bill,  2002.
[Applause.]

Bill, together with the  introductory  speech,  referred  to  the  Portfolio
Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

                                   RULING

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before going to the  next  Order,  I
would like to dispense with a ruling from last week. On Wednesday, 6  March,
the hon Nel raised a point of order  about  the  hon  Andrew's  reaction  to
being  asked  to  withdraw  an  unparliamentary  expression,  during   party
responses to a statement by the hon the Minister of Health.

The hon Nel stated that he was under the impression that the hon Andrew  had
not withdrawn the unparliamentary expression,  ``lying'',  as  he  had  been
instructed to by the Chair. He added that hon Mr Andrew had also  said  that
the hon the Minister  for  the  Public  Service  and  Administration,  while
raising a point of order, had deliberately  misled  the  House.  He  further
claimed that the hon Andrew had shown contempt for the Chair and  the  House
by the manner in which he left the House.

I undertook to examine the Hansard and give a ruling. And that is what I  am
doing now. Having now had the opportunity to study the unrevised Hansard,  I
want to rule as follows: The hon Mr Andrew  did  indeed  withdraw  the  word
``lie'', as he had been instructed to. However, before withdrawing the  word
``lie'', he added that the hon the Minister was ``deliberately  misleading''
the House. That is unparliamentary. The hon Mr Andrew should not have  tried
to circumvent a ruling  by  the  Chair  by  adding  another  unparliamentary
remark. He must therefore withdraw that remark.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I withdraw it.  [Interjections.]  If  you  are
deaf, then that is your problem. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I did hear the hon Andrew. Concerning the  manner
in which the hon Andrew left the House, he did not do  so  while  the  Chair
was addressing him. So, I do not intend commenting further on that issue.

                           DEBATE ON AFRICAN UNION

Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Madam Speaker, the ANC supports the  Constitutive  Act  of
the African Union. History shows us that as Africans we should  take  charge
and work for the development of our continent.

The theory of  development  shows  that  before  industrialisation  and  the
French  Revolution,  China  and   the   Islamic   Mamluke   Sultanate   were
scientifically more advanced than Europe. In the twentieth  century,  Africa
was characterised by famine, floods, hunger and diseases.  The  question  we
need to ask as this House is: why these drastic changes?

The answer points to colonialism which underdeveloped the continent  in  the
twentieth century. Most classical writers were  influenced  and  shocked  by
the French Revolution in the twentieth  century,  and  were  afraid  because
they had never seen political upheavals that brought chaos and  disorder  in
that manner.

The revolution changed the political and social  disorder  which  was  never
anticipated. I think in the minds of many people, they  never  thought  that
the system could change, and today, in this year 2002, here we are as  South
Africans and of course Africans. Together with the rest of the continent  we
are saying that we can change our situation.

Many people think that Africa will never change, and some even believe  that
she has been cursed  by  God.  Others  say  that  maybe  she  is  cursed  by
ancestors. During the millennium debate in this House our President said:
  The picture we would paint of  that  future  would  also  constitute  our
  commitment to work and to ensure that we transform what may seem to be  a
  dream into a new reality.

When the OAU was formed most people did not believe in it. It was seen as  a
far-fetched dream that Africans can be  freed.  It  was  a  dream  to  fight
colonial rule, but today Africa has attained its liberation.  Today  we  are
discussing the Constitutive Act of the African Union because we  acknowledge
that the first leg or terrain of the struggle has been completed, which  was
fighting colonialism. What we are saying today is  that  we  have  the  next
item on the agenda, which is liberating Africa from poverty and disease.

For the first time Africans can speak with one voice and say, even if  I  am
English-speaking or Portuguese-speaking, whether I  fala  Portuguese,  ablar
Espanol, or paroski Kavarim, what is important is that I am a human being.

This was also affirmed by the Durban conference, which agreed that  in  this
world we only have one race which is the human race. We  on  this  continent
are saying that in spite of the different languages that we speak,  we  have
one destiny, and as Africans we have to fight and ensure that we reach it.

We are saying that as Africans we must respect our  borders,  which  concern
the  question  of  sovereignty,  but  let  us  work  together   for   common
aspirations that we have and ensure that we attain them.

Ga re nyake go tloša mellwane ya rena. Ga re nyake gore re be  selo  se  tee
seo se  sa  tsebalegego,  eupša  re  nyaka  go  šomišana  gore  re  hlabolle
kontinente ye ya rena le gore kontinente ye ya rena e a hlomphega.  Gape  re
swanetše go kwešiša selo se tee - gore Kopano  ke  Maatla!  (Translation  of
Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[We do not want to remove our borders. We do not want  to  be  one  unwieldy
entity, but we want to co-operate so that we may develop our  continent  and
ensure that our continent is accorded the respect that it deserves. We  also
need to understand one thing, namely that Unity is Strength!]

If we unite at regional level, we can then emerge  strongly  at  continental
level. We do not know how Africa will look in ten to  12  years'  time  from
now. However, we should start somewhere in building this continent.

Ka sepedi re fela re re mpšapedi ga di šitwe ke sebata. Re a tseba  gore  ge
re hlakanetše mošomo, ge re na le letšema, re kgona go kgatha tema ka pela.

Ge re be re lebeletše Constitutive Act ye, re le Maloko a Palamente,  go  na
le dilo tše ntši tšeo re bonego gore di  bohlokwa.  (Translation  of  Sepedi
paragraphs follows.)

[In Sepedi we say that two dogs cannot be defeated by one  wild  animal.  We
know that when we work together, when we are part of a team, we are able  to
accomplish our task quickly.

When we studied this Constitutive Act, as members of Parliament, we noted  a
number of provisions that we regarded as crucial.]

We agreed that this Constitutive Act of the AU needed to be established.  If
we have a structure, then we will be able to implement Nepad. We  see  Nepad
as a programme that can be carried out by the African Union.  We  must  also
thank our Deputy President, Comrade Jacob Zuma, for the work he is doing  on
the continent as a whole. He has just returned from  Ethopia  where  he  met
with other leaders to discuss these issues. [Applause.]

Article 9 of the Constitutive Act of  the  AU  deals  with  the  powers  and
functions of the assembly. It clearly states that the African Union will  be
able to determine policies. This is a crucial point  in  that  we  can  only
hold countries accountable and monitor their progress  if  we  are  able  to
harmonise policies. The harmonisation  of  these  policies  is  the  key  to
ensuring that development takes place and that Nepad is implemented.

There is also a point about the orders that  should  be  instituted  by  the
African Union. It is  not  very  clear  where  we  place  the  Human  Rights
Commission at the moment. But, if  the  commission  continues  to  work  and
establishes all the organs of the  African  Union,  then  we  will  know  if
democracy has been entrenched in some of  these  countries  or  whether  the
work of the African Human Rights Commission has been nullified.  Article  14
also speaks of all these programmes that  the  African  Union  should  carry
out. When I look at all these structures, Nepad will obviously be alive  and
practical this way.

As South Africans we have experience on these issues. If  members  remember,
in 1993-4, the ANC adopted the RDP document which  became  the  Government's
programme. But, as a programme, a structure was needed which could guide  us
politically and take political responsibilities. As soon as  the  Government
adopted this document, we managed to see changes even in the  way  that  the
Government dealt with its business. Through  Nepad,  African  countries  can
involve communities in their countries to participate in decision-making.
During the Abuja Conference, which was held in Nigeria  in  the  year  2000,
our President challenged the intelligentsia  and  business  people  to  work
together towards the development of their countries. There is  definitely  a
lot for them to do now. If we look at the work that has to  be  carried  out
through Nepad, if these countries participate in  all  of  these  structures
that are established, they will find some fulfilment in their work.

I also think that, as African women, we are ready to carry out some  of  the
work, and we are working through our  regional  structures  to  ensure  that
this train does not leave us behind.

We are also happy because the participation of the Speaker  and  the  Deputy
Speaker of this Parliament has managed to change some  of  the  things  that
were not carried out  in  the  right  way.  We  have  seen  that  there  are
recommendations that are made to the  whole  clause,  to  articles  of  this
important document, and we are hoping that with the support  that  they  get
from us as Parliament, and especially from the women  of  this  country,  we
will be able to change the face of this document and this continent.

What is also important to us, as women, is to ensure that our  participation
brings more women from African countries to the decision-making bodies.

Mafelelong, mohlomphegi Speaker, rena re  le  basadi  ba  kontinente  ye  re
nyaka go bona tlala e fedile. Re nyaka gore le rena ka ngwaga wo  mongwe  re
lebelele morago, re tshwe mare a masesane, re bone gore le  rena  mohlako  o
re tlogetše. (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[In conclusion, Madam Speaker, we, the women of this continent, want to  see
hunger eradicated. We would like, one day, to look  back  and  say  we  have
also triumphed over hardship.]

In conclusion, I must therefore say that the  century  is  ours  as  African
women and we are looking at it with positive minds.  We  know  that  we  can
bring about the rebirth of this continent. We are working towards  the  rise
of this giant. We are not waiting on the side to see things happen,  but  we
are ready to participate and make the necessary changes. Therefore, the  ANC
women support the Constitutive Act of the AU. [Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, in 1991  the  heads  of  African  states  at  a
summit in Abuja in Nigeria,  through  the  adoption  of  the  Abuja  Treaty,
agreed to the concept of the  African  Union  to  replace  the  OAU  in  due
course. It envisaged the setting up of  the  AU  and  all  its  organs,  its
administrative structures and protocols would be phased in over a period  of
some 34 years.

In 1999, at a summit in Sirte in Libya,  the  heads  of  states  decided  to
speed up the process and proceeded, immediately, with the  establishment  of
the core elements of the AU. In the  year  2000,  in  Togo,  another  summit
adopted the Constitutive Act of the AU, which would  become  effective  upon
ratification by two thirds of the states of Africa. By the  year  2001  this
ratification had taken place and the one-year period during  which  the  OAU
must be phased out in favour of the AU has commenced. In July this year  the
OAU will, in fact, be replaced by the AU and it will hold its first  meeting
here in Africa.

The question can  be  asked:  Why  replace  the  OAU  with  another  African
structure called the AU? When looking at the history, the OAU was formed  in
1963 as an organisation of sovereign independent states  which  were  united
around the dominant political challenge of  that  time,  and  that  was  the
challenge of liberating the whole of Africa from colonialism.

The challenge facing Africa in the new millennium has  a  different  thrust.
It is the socioeconomic challenge of development  so  that  poverty  can  be
rolled back, so that the countries and peoples of Africa  can  play  a  more
meaningful part in shaping and sharing in  the  world  economy.  To  put  it
simply, the thrust of the OAU was political, the thrust of the AU  is  going
to be developmental.  The  emphasis  of  the  OAU  was,  understandably,  on
sovereignty and independence. The emphasis of the AU is going to be  on  co-
operation and interdependence.
While the OAU may be able  to  point  to  many  achievements,  it  has  been
singularly ineffective in those very areas which are of critical  importance
to Africa's development. Those areas are, in particular, the  resolution  of
conflict and the promotion of democratic governance. Thus  it  is  envisaged
that, in relation to the vast schedule  of  matters  affecting  development,
the countries of Africa under the AU will become more integrated  than  they
were under the OAU.

This concept of  the  AU  is  far-reaching  and  ambitious.  It  holds  many
potential advantages for the people of Africa. But there  are  bound  to  be
problems and pitfalls in the path of its implementation.

This is going to demand that the AU has  wise  and  strong  leadership.  And
herein lies a problem in itself, because while the AU envisages a number  of
supporting structures and organs, the supreme organ of the AU  will  be  the
same heads of state, functioning under  the  same  rotating  chairpersonship
that proved ineffective in leading the Organisation of African Unity in  the
past.

Some of these potential problems of implementation were  identified  by  the
Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs when it reported to  Parliament  last
year, and that report was adopted  by  Parliament.  The  report  said  inter
alia, when referring to the constitutive Act, that various clauses could  be
open to  different  interpretations;  that  various  clauses  appear  to  be
contradictory; and that clauses may be interpreted  as  impinging  upon  the
sovereignty of member states in  the  executive,  legislative  and  judicial
fields, more than is usual in the case of the formation of such a union.

But other problems were also  identified  at  a  very  useful  parliamentary
forum held in the  Old  Assembly  Chamber  only  last  week.  They  are  the
following. There is a problem with the issue of financing the African  Union
with its multiplicity of structures, organs and personnel, in the  light  of
the fact that a number of African states today appear to be  unable  to  pay
their annual dues to the Organisation of African Unity.

There  are  problems  with  integrating  five  existing  regional   economic
communities,  such  as  SADC,  Ecowas  and  Comesa,  which  are  already  in
existence, have their own structures, and  are  functioning  under  separate
treaties and protocols.

The third problem is the absence  of  a  provision  for  an  organ  to  deal
specifically with peace and stability, and the relationship between  such  a
central organ and the overriding assembly.

The fourth problem is the need to create mechanisms to  ensure  that  member
states do, in fact, comply with the  African  Union's  core  objectives  and
principles, especially in  the  fields  of  promoting  peace  and  security,
promoting  democratic  principles  and  institutions,  and  promoting  human
rights.

As the AU is structured as  a  top-down  body,  with  only  the  Pan-African
Parliament representing the citizens directly,  we  believe  that  the  Pan-
African Parliament should be brought into being  as  soon  as  possible  and
developed into a fully functioning parliament for the peoples of Africa.

However, one of the major problems will be the extent to which  the  African
Union will override the sovereignty of states, especially in  the  field  of
policy formation and implementation. Any country that  accedes  to  a  union
such as the AU must, by implication, be willing to cede a certain amount  of
sovereignty to that superbody.

But let us realise that the issue of sovereignty, even if it is only in  the
policy-making field, is an extraordinarily sensitive one. And the  questions
that are going to have to  be  answered  are  these:  To  what  extent  will
governments be prepared to dilute their authority to make policy  in  favour
of a body over which they have no control? To what extent  will  the  people
accept policies being made by a combination of  other  peoples'  governments
and not by the government which they have elected and which  is  accountable
to them? To what extent will countries be prepared to abandon policies  that
are working well for their people in favour  of  alternative  policies  with
which they disagree? And what if policies decided upon by the AU  come  into
direct conflict with the constitutions of individual countries?

Let me say, in this regard, that I for one, believe,  in  respect  of  South
Africa, that we should never agree to a process that  could  result  in  any
dilution of any one of our provisions of the Bill of  Rights  in  our  South
African Constitution.

Finally, the issue of ceding sovereignty will have to be handled with  great
circumspection. I believe it might  well  be  that  the  provisions  of  the
constitutive Act and protocols that deal with these  procedures  might  have
to be revisited.

However, much will depend on the confidence that the constituent members  of
the people of Africa have in  the  integrity  of  the  institutions  of  the
African Union. This confidence  must  be  nurtured  and  developed,  but  it
cannot be taken for granted simply because the AU is there. A start must  be
made in building an effective AU.

However, let us tackle the problems that are bound  to  exist  at  the  time
when the organisation is formed. The AU  must  face  up  to  these  critical
problems during its early stage of existence or run  the  risk  that  during
the later stage it could well be overcome  by  these  very  problems.  Above
all,  if  Africa  is  going  to  develop,  if  Africa  is  going  to   share
meaningfully in the world economy, it needs an AU in which  the  peoples  of
Africa trust and in which they have confidence. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for  me  to  follow  the  hon
member Colin. He has laid out, I think, some of the  problems  of  which  we
should be particularly aware in respect of the establishment of the  African
Union. What is very interesting is that serving on the task team  makes  one
feel that one is again in Codesa and the multiparty  talks,  because  barely
had we, as the representatives of people here, finished trying to  transform
our own country, before we became involved in a  second  exercise,  that  of
attempting to transform politics on the continent.

It is very interesting that  the  African  Union  sees  itself  not  as  the
impotent old OAU which it is replacing. It appears to be a  more  visionary,
more far-sighted body than the one that it is  replacing.  The  coming  into
being of the African Union, as we know, is imminent, therefore that  is  not
the question. The questions  that  the  hon  member  Eglin  raised  are  the
questions we should be engaged in.

The key organs that will be launched within weeks  will  be  the  following:
the assembly, which will be made up of the heads  of  state,  that  is,  the
first body; the second body will be the executive council and this  will  be
made up of the Ministers  from  the  different  countries;  then,  the  very
important commission which will actually be the secretariat;  and;  finally,
the  permanent  representatives'  committee,  which  will  be  made  up   of
ambassadors from the different countries. So it is envisaged  that,  in  the
first step, these four organs will come into being.
At the Lusaka conference from 9 to 11 July 2001, it  was  suggested  that  a
gradual approach be taken in the establishment  of  these  organs  and  that
these organs be invested  with  only  initial  powers.  This  is  important,
because they need to be able to act without being  overly  constrained.  But
it is imperative  that  the  Pan-African  Parliament  comes  into  existence
quickly enough, because we are now in a situation in world politics  and  in
local politics in which the executive arm has to  be  given  more  and  more
power in order that they  can  effectively  deliver,  because  if  they  are
impeded in that they will not then be able to deliver.

Parliaments' roles will be more and more to make  sure  that  they  exercise
oversight, and to look at the budget and  other  policy  documents.  So  the
same thing will have to happen at the African Union, in that the union  must
allow the assembly, which is made up of heads  of  state,  to  take  certain
decisions. But the Pan-African Parliament  will  have  to  come  into  being
fairly soon after the other organs are put in place.

The constitutive act does not spell out in detail the functions, powers  and
operational modalities. Once again, this will be  left  to  the  Pan-African
Parliament to do. Therefore, it should be the view of  our  Parliament  that
the implementation of the Pan African Parliament is not be  unduly  delayed.
In the interim, the draft rules of procedures  that  will  be  drawn  up  by
heads of state will apply.

The assembly will also be required to do the  following:  to  adopt  certain
rules; to  make  sure  that  they  appoint  judges  if  judges  need  to  be
appointed; to approve the budgets, and to authorise meetings. The  assembly,
which is the assembly of the heads of state,  will  meet  annually  for  two
days.

The problem that we have as South Africa, as a democracy where we  encourage
participation of the citizens in everything that we do, is that the  African
Union  is  suggesting  that  some  of  its  procedures  and  some   of   its
parliamentary Acts be done in secret, and many of us who  are  on  the  task
group are not supportive of that at all. This is one of the things  that  we
would like to flag and talk about in future.

Let us now focus on what will be replacing the secretariat, which is  called
the commission.

The commission has a number of important functions in  order  to  accelerate
political and socioeconomic integration. The moment we talk about  political
and socioeconomic integration, we  ask  ourselves:  will  this  in  any  way
jeopardise our own rights as a sovereign country? Will this  impact  in  any
way on our sovereignty?

The commission must also ensure that the  common  interests  of  Africa  are
given attention, that peace, security, democratic principles, human  rights,
sustainable development, research into science and technology, that  all  of
these matters  are  given  due  and  proper  attention.  The  commission  or
secretariat will then be divided into focus or interest groups.  Because  of
those focus or interest  groups  we  would  expect,  as  Parliament,  to  be
interacting very closely, very soon, with this commission, in order that  we
may advance not only South Africa's cause, but by the same token  the  cause
of Africa itself.

We look forward to the establishment of the African Union.

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Deputy Speaker, the project to build the African  Union
is firmly located within the long-standing  Pan-African  perspective,  which
seeks to  promote  economic,  political,  social  and  cultural  integration
between the states and peoples of our continent. Given the  current  reality
of conflict in parts of our continent, the AU programme  has  an  inevitable
and  necessary  focus  on  issues  of  peace,  security  and  political  co-
operation,  but  it  is  also  firmly  rooted  in  a  vision   of   economic
integration.

Indeed, the Sirte declaration adopted in 1999 at the  summit,  which  agreed
to speed up the process of transforming the  OAU  into  the  African  Union,
specifically indicated that  this  was  intended,  among  other  things,  to
accelerate the process of implementing the treaty to establish  the  African
Economic Community. In my view  the  case  for  promoting  African  economic
integration is an unassailable one.  The  first  generation  of  independent
African leaders realised that they  had  inherited  from  colonialism  small
fragmented economies,  integrated  into  a  global  division  of  labour  in
subaltern roles as producers of cheap raw materials.

They realised that economic growth  and  development  and  industrialisation
would require promoting economic unity on the continent. Developments  since
then have made that vision even more imperative. We are living in the  midst
of a process called globalisation. This has seen  the  rise  of  information
and communications technology  and  ICT-derived  knowledge  as  the  driving
force of rising productivity and accumulation. It is  also  a  process  that
has seen the formation of, and integration  of  productive  activity  across
the globe, into global networks. It has seen pressure for freer movement  of
capital and commodities across national borders  and  the  strengthening  of
multilateral regulation.
Various  writers  have  compared  the  rise  of  informationalism  with  the
industrial revolution in terms of its significance for  the  development  of
productive forces. But at the same time, and in my view  integrated  to  the
very same processes, globalisation has also  been  associated  with  growing
inequality, marginalisation and social exclusion.

Africa clearly faces major challenges in dealing with all  aspects  of  this
process. Our continent is not well equipped  to  embrace  the  informational
revolution. It is well known that there are more phone  connections  in  the
borough of Manhattan than there are on the whole of  African  continent.  At
the  same  time  Africa  has  to  grapple  with  the  need  to  counter  the
fundamental trends towards marginalisation and exclusion, which  are  indeed
most  marked  on  our  continent,  which  includes  the  majority  of  least
developed countries in the world. Clearly greater economic unity can  assist
in meeting both aspects of this challenge.

But acknowledging the  need  to  promote  continental  economic  integration
raises the need to address the fundamental question of how  this  should  be
done. Conventional economic integration theory focuses  on  the  removal  of
tariffs and regulatory barriers to interregional trade. It envisages  moving
in linear succession up the so-called ladder  of  integration  from  a  free
trade area where tariffs are removed on trade  between  participants,  to  a
customs union where there is internal  free  trade  and  a  common  external
tariff on goods from third parties.

This is followed by a common market where there is free movement  of  labour
and of capital, and then an economic union in which there is  a  high  level
of macroeconomic policy co-ordination and possibly also  a  monetary  union.
Finally, you end up with a political union which may  take  the  form  of  a
federation or confederation.

This theory, which broadly guided the process of European  integration,  has
been criticised, and rightly so in my  view,  as  inappropriate  to  regions
which are characterised by underdevelopment,  even  though  the  reality  is
that it continues to inform a number of subregional integration  efforts  on
our own continent.

The reality is that the major barriers to promoting economic integration  in
Africa are not just, or even primarily,  tariffs  and  regulatory  barriers,
but  also  involve,  more  fundamentally,  inadequate   infrastructure   and
underdeveloped production structures.

An experts meeting that was held  to  discuss  the  topic  of  economic  co-
operation in December last  year  described  progress  in  enhancing  intra-
African trade creation as ``dismal''. The same report said  that  less  than
10% of the  continent's  trade  was  intra-African  and  that  most  of  the
subregion's integration schemes were way behind schedule.

These grim realities underscore the case, in my view, for the adoption of  a
clear   developmental   approach   towards   promoting   African    economic
integration. Setting out from a recognition that many of the major  barriers
to intraregional trade  in  underdeveloped  regions  arise  from  inadequate
infrastructure  and  underdeveloped   production   structures,   development
integration theory  argues  for  a  greater  emphasis  at  early  stages  on
functional  co-operation  to   promote   infrastructural   development   and
development of productive structures.

Nepad, with its  emphasis  on  co-operation  to  address  both  conventional
infrastructure  backlogs,  such  as  transport  and  communication,  and  in
particular  ICT-related  backlogs,  offers,  in  my  view,   a   clear   and
appropriate vision to such functional co-operation.

But,  we  cannot  avoid  trade  integration  issues.   Indeed,   development
integration argues that functional co-operation is necessary,  precisely  in
order to lay  a  basis  for  effective  integration.  In  our  own  concrete
circumstances, we need to be aware that globalisation is promoting  a  rapid
but uneven integration into a global economy.

In addition, there are specific developments arising from relations  between
African  countries  and  important  extraregional  players  that  are   very
significant in this regard. The economic  partnership  agreements  envisaged
under the Cotonou agreement between the EU and  the  ACP,  negotiations  for
which are due to begin in September this  year,  will  begin,  the  European
Union hopes, a process that will lead to reciprocal  trade  agreements  with
different ACP regions. In a  paper  which  was  presented  at  the  workshop
organised by the Speaker's Office, the DTI pointed  out  that  this  process
could result, if nothing was done, in South Africa trading  on  worse  terms
with, say, Kenya or Nigeria, than the European Union does. Clearly, this  is
an outcome which should be unacceptable. The  same  would  apply  to  Kenyan
trade with Nigeria, or even Tanzanian trade with Kenya.

As the DTI document argued, we will  have  to  explore  options  to  promote
trade integration, which might include preferential co-operation  agreements
between subregional integration bodies, for example SADC and  Ecowas,  or  a
continent-wide free trade agreement.

In my view, we need from this  Parliament  to  take  forward  into  our  own
society and into the various intra-parliamentary  bodies  in  which  we  are
involved, a debate on the broader strategic approach to  promoting  economic
co-operation and integration within the framework of the AU.

We need - and I think this is absolutely clear - a programme  to  accelerate
development and co-operation  on  our  continent.  Greater  clarity  on  the
approach  could  underpin  discussions  about  targets  and   decisions   on
institution-building  within  the  AU.  For  example,  clarity  on  a  clear
developmental perspective could inform a review of  the  appropriateness  or
otherwise of the vision to build a customs union on  the  African  continent
by the year 2025. It could also clarify the role which the  African  Central
Bank, provided for in the Constitutive Act  of  the  African  Union,  should
play, which  arguably  should  initially  focus  on  promoting  co-operation
between individual  central  banks  along  the  lines  of  the  Finance  and
Investment  Sector  Co-ordinating  Unit  of  SADC,  rather  than  trying  to
champion some unrealistic and premature leap into monetary union.

I want to conclude by commending the  presiding  officers  for  taking  this
issue, which was referred to Parliament by the President, so seriously,  and
for creating opportunities for empowering us in Parliament  to  engage  more
effectively with it. I believe that we  are  only  at  the  beginning  of  a
process. This is likely to be the first of several debates  on  this  issue,
as  we  grapple  with  what  will  undoubtedly  be  vital  issues  for   the
development of our continent. [Applause.]

Mev A VAN WYK: Mev die Speaker, in 'n  kontinent  waar  naamveranderings  en
die verandering van simbole dikwels gebruik word om die  aandag  af  te  lei
van die werklik kritieke uitdagings wat alle Afrikane in  die  gesig  staar,
verdien die poging om ware transformasie  in  Afrika  teweeg  te  bring  die
steun van hierdie Parlement, want die oorgang van die  OAE  na  die  Afrika-
unie is nie net bloot 'n naamverandering nie.  Dit  is  'n  poging  om  deur
middel van 'n nuwe vaartbelynde organisasie die  doelwitte  van  die  Afrika
Ekonomiese Gemeenskap, soos saamgevat in die Abuja Ooreenkoms,  te  versnel.
Van hierdie doelwitte, wat eers oor 'n tydperk van 34 jaar  hul  beslag  sou
kry,  is  onder  meer:   Sterk   streeksekonomieë,   vryhandelsgebiede,   'n
ekonomiese gemeenskapsmark, een geldeenheid en  'n  sentrale  bank.  In  dié
stadium  moet   sterk   streeksekonomieë   voorkeur   geniet,   want   beter
lewensomstandighede kan onder meer lei tot 'n afname in konflik.

Tydens die werkswinkel wat onlangs gehou is, was die kommissie  wat  daarmee
gehandel het dit eens dat politieke integrasie  van  die  vasteland  in  dié
stadium nie soseer gaan  om  'n  formele  struktuur  soos  'n  federasie  of
konfederasie nie. Tans  moet  politieke  integrasie  eerder  'n  gevoel  van
samehorigheid  uitdruk  ten  einde  die  gemeenskaplike   uitdagings,   soos
byvoorbeeld. globalisering, die hoof te kan bied. En as  'n  mens  dink  dat
die Portugese ontdekkingreise van ongeveer 500 jaar gelede en die  vestiging
op 20 Maart van die VOC, 400 jaar gelede, waardeur die  moderne  tydperk  en
ontwikkeling in die Ooste,  Afrika  en  die  Amerikas  ingelei  is,  eintlik
beskou kan word as die begin van globalisering, is  dit  nie  voortydig  vir
hierdie Parlement om nou daadwerklik hieraan aandag te gee nie.

Die kwessie van soewereiniteit word  nie  voldoende  in  die  ``Constitutive
Act'' aangespreek nie en Suid-Afrika sal hom deeglik daarvan moet  vergewis,
aangesien sekere bepalings strydig met ons eie Grondwet kan wees - soos  agb
lede reeds gehoor het. Die wye magte van die ``Assembly'' - die  vergadering
van staatshoofde - is moontlik 'n goeie voorbeeld. Die Nuwe  NP  wil  daarom
voorstel dat die ad hoc kommissie wat  die  bekragtiging  van  die  protokol
moet oorweeg, spesifiek ook ondersoek  instel  na  die  uitwerking  van  die
``Constitutive  Act''  op  ons  eie  Grondwet  en  hoe  dit  slaan  op   die
soewereiniteit van die Republiek.

Ten opsigte van soewereiniteit is artikel 4(g) en  4(h)  van  die  Beginsels
nie in stryd met mekaar nie, maar moet vertolk word ingevolge  artikel  3(h)
onder Doelwitte. Artikels 4(g) praat van ``non interference  by  any  member
state in the internal affairs of another''.

Artikel 4(h) lui soos volg:


  The right of the Union to intervene in  a  member  state  pursuant  to  a
  decision of the Assembly in respect of grave  circumstances,  namely  war
  crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.

Artikel 3(h) lui weer soos volg:


  Promote and protect human and people's  rights  in  accordance  with  the
  African Charter of the UN and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Met ander woorde, state kan hulle nie langer op soewereiniteit beroep en  op
nie-inmenging in huishoudelike sake wanneer  hulle  na  hartelus  menseregte
vertrap nie. Hierdie beginsel het reeds gegeld toe  die  wêreld  van  mening
was dat vorige Suid-Afrikaanse regerings hierdie regte geskend  het  en  dit
geld tans in die verhoor van Slobodan Milosovich. Eweneens behoort  dit  ook
gelykberegtigend te geld ten opsigte van 'n hele paar regerings  ten  noorde
van ons. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, on a continent where  name  changes  and  the
changing of symbols are often  used  to  divert  attention  from  the  truly
critical challenges which face all Africans,  an  attempt  to  achieve  true
transformation in Africa deserves the support of  this  Parliament.  Because
the transition of the OAU to the African Union is not merely a name  change.
It is an  attempt  to  expedite  the  objectives  of  the  African  Economic
Community, as contained in the Abuja Treaty, by way  of  a  new  streamlined
organisation. Among these objectives, which were only to have  been  settled
over a period of 34 years, are the  following:  strong  regional  economies,
free-trade areas, an economic common market,  one  currency  and  a  central
bank. At this  stage  strong  regional  economies  must  receive  preference
because improved living conditions could, inter alia, lead  to  a  reduction
in conflict.

During the workshop held recently, the commission dealing  with  the  matter
agreed that political integration of the continent at this stage is  not  so
much a matter of a formal structure  like  a  federation  or  confederation.
Currently,  political  integration  should  rather  express  a  feeling   of
solidarity  in  order  to  be  able  to  meet  common  challenges,  such  as
globalisation, for example. And if one thinks that  the  Portuguese  voyages
of discovery approximately 500 years ago and the establishment on  20  March
of the  VOC,  400  years  ago,  by  way  of  which  the  modern  period  and
development in the East, Africa  and  the  Americas  were  ushered  in,  can
actually be viewed as the beginning of globalisation, it  is  not  premature
for this Parliament now truly to give attention to this.

The issue of sovereignty is not sufficiently addressed in  the  Constitutive
Act and South Africa will  have  to  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  it,  as
certain provisions could be in violation of our own Constitution  -  as  hon
members have already heard. The broad powers of the assembly -  the  meeting
of heads of state - is possibly a good example. For this reason the  New  NP
would like to propose that the ad hoc commission which has to  consider  the
ratification of  the  protocol  should  also  specifically  investigate  the
effect of the Constitutive Act on our own Constitution and  how  it  affects
the sovereignty of the Republic.

With regard to sovereignty, sections 4(g) and 4(h)  of  the  Principles  are
not in conflict with one another,  but  must  be  interpreted  in  terms  of
section  3(h)  under  Objectives.  Section  4(g)   talks   about   ``non   -
interference by any Member State  in  the  internal  affairs  of  another''.
Section 4(h) reads as follows:


  The right of the Union to intervene in  a  Member  State  pursuant  to  a
  decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances,  namely:  war
  crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.

Section 3(h) reads as follows:


  Promote and protect human and peoples'  rights  in  accordance  with  the
  African Charter of the United Nations and the  Universal  Declaration  of
  Human Rights.

In other words, states can no longer claim sovereignty and  non-interference
in domestic matters when they trample human rights at will.  This  principle
was already valid when the world  was  of  the  opinion  that  former  South
African governments were violating these rights and it  is  still  valid  in
the trial of Slobodan Milosovich. In the same way it  should  apply  equally
with regard to a number of governments to the north of us.]

In  the  light  of  the  negative  effect  that  these   ongoing   political
transgressions have on our subregion, the protocol establishing the  African
Parliament must be ratified by our Parliament as soon as possible. In  this,
South Africa should play its natural  leadership  role  in  the  region  and
encourage other signatories to follow suit. This ought to be implemented  in
terms of the constitutive act of the African Union, and not in terms of  the
Abuja Treaty.

Regarding our northern neighbours, the question should be asked whether  all
members of the OAU  should  automatically  become  members  of  the  African
Union, and whether censorship should not be applied from the beginning.  The
New NP feels that everyone should, indeed, become a  member,  but  that  the
Commission for People's and Human Rights, in terms of  the  African  Charter
on People's and Human Rights, should then actually be applied to  discipline
future transgressors of human  rights.  This  commission  should  become  an
organ of the African Union.

Mr W G MAKANDA: Madam Speaker, the emerging  African  Union  can  became  an
instrument of African development and advancement in all spheres of  society
if member states and their leaders have the political will to make it work.

First we must identify  the  weaknesses  that  have  impeded  the  OAU  from
carrying out its mandate, and have turned it into a moribund talk-shop  with
no clear direction and no clout. The OAU evolved as a  postcolonial  African
institution  that  sought   to   give   substance   to   African   political
independence. It did not have the capacity to extricate the  continent  from
the  stranglehold  of  economic,  social  and  spiritual  dependence   which
emanated from the colonial and  postcolonial  power  relations  between  the
developed north and the underdeveloped south.

The decolonization policies of the European powers handed down a  legacy  of
parallel corridors in which they conduct  business  between  themselves  and
their erstwhile colonies with no  horizontal  infrastructural  and  economic
linkages between the newly independent former colonies themselves. This  has
retarded  the  evolution  of  a  common  vision  and  a  binding  sense   of
Africanness and commitment to take the  African  revolution  forward  beyond
the  Africanisation  of  the  political  institutions  to  the  transfer  of
economic power to the African masses, not just the new political  elite  and
its intelligentsia.

The African Union must be driven by a new vision. Central to this vision  is
the  uncompromising  and  radical  transformation  of  the  economic   power
relations that will enable Africa to freely and fully develop its  economic,
social, spiritual, cultural and intellectual potential.

The African Renaissance would be the vehicle of  this  renewal  provided  it
assumes the essence of a truly liberating  force.  For  the  renaissance  to
have any relevance, it must be truly  revolutionary,  engulfing  the  entire
African continent at the grassroots, just as the 16th  century  Renaissance,
the French Revolution, the Cuban and the Chinese revolutions and  the  Great
Emancipation were, to mention but a few.

We cannot gloss over the reality of the complexity  and  the  deeply  rooted
inequalities of the modern world order that  have  been  handed  down  as  a
legacy of the African slave trade, a world trade based on colonialism and  a
globalised economy of unequal and uneven development. In his  book  entitled
Poverty of Philosophy, Karl Marx wrote:


  Without slavery no cotton; without cotton,  no  modern  industry.  It  is
  slavery which has made the colonies valuable; the colonies  have  created
  world trade; world  trade  is  the  necessary  condition  of  large-scale
  machine industry.

This is the foundation on which the present-day African continent is built.

It should be clear therefore that the socioeconomic structure of  the  world
order and, therefore, Africa, is  based  on  the  social  interests  of  the
powerful global formations. These interests groups are not moved by  maudlin
sentimentalism about African  misery  and  suffering,  unless  it  threatens
their own survival. African renewal will not be realised through appeals  to
the European Union, North America or the G8. Their  helping  hand  can  only
serve their own interests, not those of Africa. We  must  therefore  develop
Africa's  capacity,  self-sufficiency,  and   intellectual   and   spiritual
liberation.

Africa has an abundance of untapped resources which  must  be  developed  by
the Africans themselves. What we need is education and skills, and the  will
and the confidence in self-reliance.

Let us develop the African infrastructure and internal continental trade  in
order to create African capacity. To achieve this we should not  be  closing
down black universities and  tertiary  institutions  which  give  access  to
education to previously disadvantaged communities and yet preserve  formerly
white, privileged institutions. The fact that these black institutions  have
apartheid  origins  does  not  divest  them   of   educational   value   and
accessibility to disadvantaged communities  who  would  be  marginalised  if
these institutions were closed or watered down.

Africa   must   develop   institutions   that   guarantee   broad   national
participation and that are  endorsed  by  the  people  on  the  ground.  The
interests of the people must be  paramount  and  drive  African  governance.
Once we embrace this concept, there will be no room for  greed,  megalomania
and the scourge of war that blight our continent.

Let me conclude by quoting  one  of  our  own  homegrown  African  scholars.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I regret you do  not  have  time  to  quote,  hon
member. Your time has expired. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Adv Z  L  MADASA:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  there  is  no  doubt  about  the
desirability of restructuring the OAU, because it has outlived its purpose.

The time has surely come for the African continent to work together  towards
the development of its people. The Constitutive Act  of  the  African  Union
establishes the union with the  various  organs  to  support  it.  The  most
important departure the union  has  introduced  is  the  principle  of  good
governance to which member states agree to be bound. Accedence to the  union
by member states is therefore a conscious  decision  to  adhere  to  certain
values and standards of good governance. It is also an acceptance by  member
states  that  resort  to  the  usual  arguments  of  sovereignty,  when  the
principles of the union are violated, will  not  prevail.  The  Constitutive
Act of the African Union is therefore cast in  developmental  terms  instead
of protectionism.

In an ideal situation the formal coming into being of the union should  have
been preceded by economic integration. This would have  incentivised  member
states to co-operate on clear and developmental  advantages.  Member  states
would have realised that non-co-operation would have  negative  consequences
for their economies.

The  reality,  though,  is  that  globalisation  poses  a  real  danger   of
marginalising the continent and its people if they  do  not  work  together.
This and other immediate challenges has  necessitated  the  acceleration  of
the establishment of the union. This means that a politically  driven  union
is the only viable mechanism to ensure that integration takes place soon.

An issue that has been raised is whether member states of the OAU should  be
allowed to join the union as they are at present, taking into  account  that
the Constitutive Act of the African Union is restrictive  on  membership.  I
am of the opinion that in order to ensure that the union takes off, it  must
be borne in mind that time is needed for member states to adjust to the  new
rules. Strict adherence to the Act of the Constitutive African Union  before
joining will defeat the ends of the union. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Deputy Speaker, the late President Kwame  Nkrumah  of
Ghana, in the late 1950s started a movement  which  stressed  the  immediate
unity of the African continent. He believed that  the  continent  should  be
united to make it less vulnerable to outside influence. Thus  in  May  1963,
32 independent African states came together in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia,  to
create the Organisation for African Unity.

As daar vandag  na  die  geskiedenis  van  die  OAE  van  1963  tot  in  die
negentigerjare gekyk word, blyk dit dat die  agenda  jaarliks  by  die  OAE-
byeenkomste oorheers is deur die geveg teen  kolonialisme,  die  geveg  teen
apartheid en om Afrika se rol in die Koue Oorlog te bepaal.

Tydens die Koue Oorlog het Afrika en die Derde Wêreld die belangrike  balans
tussen die Weste en die Oosblok  Kommunistiese  lande  gehou.  Dit  het  aan
Afrika meer invloed  as  wat  sy  politieke  mag  was,  gegee.  Die  OAE  se
vergaderings is dus oorheers deur  kritiek  teen  die  koloniale  moondhede,
teen die Weste wat vir al Afrika se probleme van daardie tyd geblameer is.

In 2002 bevind ons in Afrika ons in 'n totale nuwe wêreld. Dit maak 'n  nuwe
organisasie vir die nuwe Afrika soos die  Afrika  Unie  noodsaaklik.  Gesien
vanuit die OAE se oogpunt  is  die  stryd  teen  kolonialisme  en  apartheid
afgehandel. Die  Koue  Oorlog  is  verby,  met  Amerika  as  die  wêreld  se
hoofrolspeler wat nie meer lyk of hy Afrika andersins nodig het nie.  Afrika
het nou nuwe leiers met 'n nuwe organisasie nodig wat  die  nuwe  uitdagings
kan aanpak. Waar President Mugabe en die OAE deel van die ou Afrika is,  wil
die VF hoop dat President Mbeki en die Afrika Unie deel van die nuwe  Afrika
is, wat op realistiese wyse die probleme van Afrika sal aanpak.

Die ou styl van ou leiers van Afrika is  soos  duskant  in  Zimbabwe  gesien
word met President Mugabe wat almal blameer vir sy probleme  -  die  Britte,
die boere, al maak die boere minder as 1% van die bevolking uit. Ons is  nou
moeg daarvoor dat alles altyd geblameer word na  daardie  kant  toe.  Daarom
kort ons - en sal die VF dit graag ondersteun -  'n  nuwe  organisasie,  die
Afrika Unie, wat suksesvol die huidige probleme  realisties  sal  aanpak  en
dit deurvoer na die anderkant op 'n moderne wyse, en nie vashaak in  die  ou
dae se blameertegnieke nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[If we look at the history  of  the  OAU  today,  from  1963  up  until  the
nineties, it seems that  annually  the  agenda  at  the  OAU  meetings  were
dominated by the fight against colonialism, the fight against apartheid  and
to determine Africa's role in the Cold War.

During the Cold War, Africa and the Third  World  maintained  the  important
balance between the West and the Eastern  block  Communist  countries.  This
gave Africa more influence than political power. The  meetings  of  the  OAU
were therefore dominated by criticism against the colonial  powers,  against
the West who were blamed for all Africa's problems of that time period.

In 2002 the people of Africa find themselves in a totally  new  world.  This
makes a new organisation for Africa such as the African Union  a  necessity.
Seen from the point of view of the OAU the struggle against colonialism  and
apartheid has been concluded. The Cold War is  over,  with  America  as  the
world's chief roleplayer who does not seem to be needing Africa any  longer.
Africa now needs new leaders with a new organisation who can tackle the  new
challenges. Where President Mugabe and the OAU are part of the  old  Africa,
the FF would like to hope that President Mbeki and the African  Union  would
be part of the new Africa, who will address the  problems  of  Africa  in  a
realistic manner.

President Mugabe of Zimbabwe is an example of the old style of  old  leaders
of Africa who blames everyone for his problems - the British, the farmers  -
even though the farmers only comprises 1% of the population.

We are now tired of the fact that everything is always blamed on that  side.
Therefore  we  need  -  and  the  FF  will  gladly  support  this  -  a  new
organisation, the  African  Union,  which  would  successfully  address  the
current problems in a realistic way and carry it through to the  other  side
in a modern manner, and not get entangled in the blaming techniques  of  the
old days.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Madam Speaker, his  Excellency  the  Deputy  President,  hon
Ministers and fellow  members  of  this  august  House,  allow  me  at  this
occasion of the debate on the African Union to  commence  by  congratulating
the peoples of Zimbabwe for  successfully  conducting  a  peaceful  election
over the weekend ... [Applause.] ... amidst severe scepticism  expressed  in
the media and elsewhere that such an event would not occur without  violence
and intimidation. I am sure I speak on behalf of  many  of  our  peaceloving
people.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: All the blind!

Mr M T MASUTHA: I also wish  to  express  our  unqualified  support  of  the
people of the Democratic Republic of Congo during  these  challenging  times
of seeking lasting peace  through  negotiation  rather  than  through  armed
conflict and the use of force. In addition,  the  recent  events  in  Angola
offer a real opportunity for the complete elimination  of  conflict  in  our
region and on our continent, which is a prerequisite for prosperity. I  also
wish to express to our Deputy  President  that  we  missed  him  during  the
President's debate, as he was continuing  the  work  of  pursuing  peace  in
Africa.

During his state of the nation address last month, the President alluded  to
the anticipated hosting  on  our  soil  of  two  summit  meetings  of  great
significance to Africa and the world, namely the founding summit meeting  to
launch the African Union  in  July  and  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development in August/September  this  year.  He  further  stated  that  the
summit meeting of the African Union, which  in  addition  to  launching  the
African Union will among other things also address  the  critical  challenge
of securing lasting peace and stability, and  good  economic  and  political
governance in Africa, will also consider specific programmes which  will  be
implemented through  Nepad,  to  ensure  development  programmes  which  are
central  to   the   objectives   of   the   elimination   of   poverty   and
underdevelopment in Africa.

It is ironic that Africa, the very cradle of humanity  and  kindergarten  of
human civilisation, as confirmed by the evidence  of  exquisite  bone  tools
and delicately made spear points  more  than  70  000  years  ago,  and  the
spectacular find of a slab of ochre engraved with abstract  designs  77  000
years  ago,  gathered  from  the  Blombos  Cave,  emerges  from  a   history
summarised by the President in his inaugural speech  of  16  June  1999,  as
follows, and I quote:


  As Africans, we are the children of  the  abyss,  who  have  sustained  a
  backward march for half a millennium.


  We have been a source for human slaves. Our countries  were  turned  into
  the patrimony of colonial powers. We have been victim to our own  African
  predators.


  If this is not merely the wish being father to the thought, something  in
  the air seems to suggest  that  we  are  emerging  out  of  the  dreadful
  centuries which in the practice, and in the ideology and consciousness of
  some, defined us as subhuman.

The launching of the African Union,  which  comes  at  the  dawn  of  a  new
century and millennium,  will,  hopefully,  usher  in  a  new  beginning  in
Africa. The African Renaissance formally puts to rest  the  tumultuous  past
of Africa, marred by many wars, armed conflicts and violence,  the  evidence
of which manifests itself in the many people  who  have  lost  their  limbs,
vision, hearing and, in certain instances, even mental abilities. It  is  an
unenviable past that is characterised by elements of  despotism,  autocracy,
gross human rights violations, disregard for the sanctity of human life  and
anarchy, which we Africans are challenged to make a thing of the past.

The Constitutive Act of the African Union, ratified on behalf of the  people
of  this  country  by  this  House  some  time  last  year,   provides   the
institutional foundation on which the African Union will be  built.  Amongst
the difficult political questions reflected in  this  founding  document  is
the tension between the  need  to  preserve  and  protect  the  sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of member states of the union on  the
one hand, and the promotion of the political and  socioeconomic  integration
of the continent, based on the universal recognition of the values of  human
and peoples' rights on the other.

The  promotion  of   democratic   principles   and   institutions,   popular
participation and good governance are amongst the  ideas  espoused  in  this
document. A unique feature of this Act is the recognition  of  the  role  of
the people, and not merely that of states  as  political  institutions.  Our
own experience in South Africa during the drafting of the  Constitution  was
characterised  by  unprecedented  direct  public  participation,  with  both
ordinary citizens and organs of civil society afforded ample opportunity  to
contribute towards the shaping of our own Constitution, which today  we  are
all proud of.

While the Constitutive Act of the African Union represents  the  culmination
of extensive negotiation between states, more  work  needs  to  be  done  to
ensure the popularisation of this instrument amongst ordinary people and  to
ensure that the people of this continent assume full ownership thereof.

The establishment of  the  economic,  social  and  cultural  council  as  an
advisory organ composed of different social and professional groups  of  the
member states of the union  established  in  terms  of  article  22  of  the
Constitutive Act of the African Union will,  it  would  appear,  ensure  not
only the inclusion of questions of  human  and  social  development  on  the
agenda of the union, but also the institutionalised participation of  organs
of civil society entrusted with the task of advancing these issues.

The recognition of the African Charter on  Human  and  Peoples'  Rights  and
other human rights instruments, such as the African Charter  on  the  Rights
and Welfare of the child, as well as the provision for the establishment  of
an African court of justice in terms of the Constitutive Act of the  African
Union, offers a real opportunity to safeguard the rights of  the  people  of
Africa in a new dispensation to be ushered in by the  establishment  of  the
union.

The establishment of the  African  Union  creates  a  real  opportunity  for
sustainable  development  on  the  continent  as  a  whole,  by  not  merely
recognising but also fostering the economic and social  integration  of  the
peoples of the continent. The African Union will help  to  reduce  not  only
the  socioeconomic  disparities  among  African  nations,  but  also  within
nations and communities of Africa.

The union also offers a real opportunity for economic, social  and  cultural
exchange among the peoples of the continent which will help  foster  harmony
and compassion, and help eradicate negative attitudes  such  as  xenophobia,
tribalism and nepotism so as to  achieve  true  African  values  of  Ubuntu.
[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the African Union is a product  of  the  Pan-
Africanist philosophy, which is called Pan-Africanism. The major purpose  of
the Pan Africanist vision were to protect the  vital  interests  of  Africa,
see that its riches benefited the African people, and ensure the  collective
security and survival of the people of Africa,  who  have  been  victims  of
slavery, colonialism and racism. The main objectives of  the  African  Union
must be the industrialisation  and  development  of  Africa's  economy,  the
modernisation  of  her  agriculture,  and  the  maintenance  of  peace   and
stability on the continent.
The African Union must  stop  exporting  Africa's  raw  materials  and  then
importing them back, at exorbitant prices, as finished products from  Europe
and America. Modern science and technology must be prioritised  in  Africa's
institutions of learning. The African Union must be careful not to create  a
new dependency. The dependency  of  Nepad  on  G8  countries  -  the  former
colonisers of Africa - is aggravated  by  the  conditionalities  imposed  on
Africa. They enslave Africans, rather than help them to be self-reliant  and
strong economically, and to advance technologically.

Nepad must not be an unequal partnership. Africa is expected to  change  her
policies,  but  the  former  colonisers  upon  which  Nepad  is  to   depend
financially do not show signs of change. Debt cancellation is one area  that
would signal the  good  faith  of  G8  countries  towards  equalising  power
relations with Africa. A massive transfer of technology to and  training  in
Africa would create a meaningful partnership between Africa and the G8.

The PAC supports the Constitutive Act of the African Union,  but  urges  the
African Union to reaffirm the Lagos Plan of Action and the African  Peoples'
Consensus as pointing the way, which  can  deliver  genuine  development  to
African people and ensure their self-reliance and genuine independence.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the continent of Africa has found  itself  a
victim of colonialism. Organisations such as  the  Organisation  of  African
Unity, the OAU, served as a  mechanism  of  recovery  from  this  period  of
horror in which the continent  was  raped  of  its  assets  and  its  people
exploited.

After many decades and hard work on  efforts  to  correct  and  re-establish
Africa, the MF welcomes the African Union. The running of  South  Africa  is
much affected by the rest of Africa and vice versa,  as  recently  noted  in
the fluctuation of our rand.

The African Union  certainly  has  good  aims  and  objectives  for  Africa.
Betterment of Africa would certainly be brought about by a union of  African
nations working together towards attaining the values and norms of  the  OAU
and the AEC.

The MF supports the promotion of unity, cohesion and co-operation among  the
people  of  Africa  and  African  states.  This  would   influence   further
liberation and development, and lead to  a  situation  within  Africa  where
problems are tackled in a more organised, effective and efficient manner.

The African Union will not only be the backbone of  Africa  but,  having  to
attend to internal matters in a more  organised  manner,  will  also  assist
Africa's performance and recognition globally. That would,  hopefully,  give
us an advantage and render us a strong force to contend with.

The MF recognises the  contribution  the  African  Union  can  make  towards
Africa's  internal  and  international  development  and  advancement.   The
African Union is determined  to  promote  and  protect  human  and  peoples'
rights, to consolidate democratic institutions and  culture  and  to  ensure
good governance and the rule of law.
The MF applauds the African Union and supports its endeavours. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, die voorloper van die  Afrika-unie,  die  OAE,
is in Mei 1963 in die lewe geroep  deur  31  onafhanklike  Afrikastate,  met
vier doelstellings: om eenheid tussen Afrikastate te bewerkstellig;  om  die
res van die vasteland van kolonialisme en apartheid te bevry;  om  vrede  in
Afrika  te  bevorder  en  om  ekonomiese  en  maatskaplike  vooruitgang   te
verseker. Die eerste  twee  doelstellings  het  grootliks  gerealiseer.  Die
groot uitdaging lê nou by vrede  en  ekonomiese  vooruitgang.  Dit  kan  ook
saamgevat word in die visie van 'n Afrika renaissance,  soos  vergestalt  in
die Nepad-program.

Waar iemand soos  Kwame  Nkrumah  veral  klem  gelê  het  op  die  politieke
bevryding, is die ekonomiese bevryding nou  op  die  agenda.  Die  vraag  is
egter of Afrika op  koers  is  na  hierdie  doelstellings.  Gemeet  aan  die
doelstellings van vrede en  ekonomiese  voortuitgang  skiet  Afrika  ver  te
kort. Om voortdurend Afrika se probleme toe te skryf  aan  die  eerste  twee
wat reeds gerealiseer het, word eenvoudig nie meer  aanvaar  nie  en  Afrika
moet nou self verantwoordelikheid aanvaar. Die OAE huldig die standpunt  dat
regerings wat nie  op  demokratiese  wyse  aan  bewind  gekom  het  nie,  se
lidmaatskap geskrap moet word.

Nou lê die groot toets voor: Wat van 'n regering wat op ondemokratiese  wyse
aan bewind gebly het? Na  alle  verwagting  gaan  mnr  Mugabe  hierdie  week
aangewys word as die president van Zimbabwe. Hoe het  hy  dit  reggekry?  Hy
het dit gedoen met geweld, intimidasie, verkragting van alle  beginsels  van
die regstaat, en manipulering van die verkiesingsproses.  Wat  gaan  die  AU
doen ten opsigte van Zimbabwe? Enige hoop  van  ekonomiese  voortuitgang  in
Afrika sal 'n ydele droom bly, solank as wat  maghebbers  soos  Mugabe  soos
adders aan die Afrikaboesem vertroetel word.

President  Mbeki  het  onlangs  verwys  na   die   sogenaamde   ``collective
punishment'' van Afrikalande. Ander word gestraf  vir  die  oortredings  van
een. Dit is bloot ekonomiese realiteit en Afrika moet hom  van  sulke  mense
distansieer. Afrika het nou 'n geleentheid om homself te bewys, om te  bewys
dat hy ernstig is oor vrede en ekonomiese voortuitgang. Wat die  Afrika-unie
in die toekoms met 'n onregmatig verkose president in  Zimbabwe  gaan  doen,
gaan in groot  mate  die  toekoms  van  die  AU  en  die  vasteland  bepaal.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the  predecessor  of  the  African  Union,  the
Organisation  for  African  Unity,  was  established  in  May  1963  by   31
independent African states, and had four objectives: to  forge  unity  among
African states; to free the rest  of  the  continent  from  colonialism  and
apartheid; to promote peace in Africa and  to  ensure  economic  and  social
progress. The first two objectives have largely  been  realised.  The  major
challenge now lies in achieving peace  and  economic  progress.  This  could
also be summarised in the vision of an African renaissance, as  embodied  in
the Nepad programme.

Where someone like Kwame  Nkrumah  laid  particular  emphasis  on  political
liberation, economic liberation is now  on  the  agenda.  The  question  is,
however, whether Africa is on course towards  these  objectives.  Judged  by
the objectives of peace and economic progress Africa is falling very  short.
Continually to ascribe South Africa's problems to the first two, which  have
already been realised, is simply no longer  acceptable,  and  Africa  itself
must now accept responsibility. The  OAU  adheres  to  the  standpoint  that
membership of governments that had not  come  into  power  in  a  democratic
manner should be terminated.

Now the big test lies ahead: What about a government that  has  remained  in
power in an undemocratic manner? It is  expected  that  Mr  Mugabe  will  be
appointed as the president of Zimbabwe this week. How did  he  do  this?  He
did it by means of violence, intimidation, violation of every  principle  of
the constitutional state, and manipulation of the election process. What  is
the AU going to do with regard to Zimbabwe? Any hope  of  economic  progress
in Africa will remain an empty dream as long as potentates like  Mugabe  are
cherished like serpents in Africa's bosom.

President  Mbeki  recently  made  reference  to  the  so-called  "collective
punishment"  of   African   countries.   Others   are   punished   for   the
transgressions of one. This is simply economic  reality  and  Africa  should
distance itself from such people. Africa now has  an  opportunity  to  prove
itself, to prove that it is serious about peace and economic progress.  What
the African Union is going to do with an  unlawfully  elected  president  in
Zimbabwe in the future will to a great degree determine the  future  of  the
AU and the continent.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, Azapo welcomes the adoption of the  Pan-
Africanist Parliament protocol and  the  establishment  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament. To many of us in this House, this is a  very  big  step  in  the
right direction.

We have seen groupings forming all around us. Azapo believes  that  this  is
the most important of them all, for the following reasons: Many problems  of
the continent of Africa will be resolved with concerted effort and a  united
voice.

The harmonisation of policies on these matters will,  for  the  first  time,
afford Africa the ability to speak with one united voice.

Intra-African trade and commerce, as well as development,  will  take  place
at an accelerated pace. Certainly, Africa is now going to be able  to  enter
into international trade agreements on a much stronger footing than before.

Azapo hopes that the stage of being only a consultative  and  advisory  body
will be for a short time, because we hope that it  will  grow  into  a  real
parliament  with  legislative,  executive  and  judicial  powers.  Azapo  is
awaiting the day when all the bodies that constitute the African  Parliament
will be established so that we can participate in  shaping  the  destiny  of
our country and our continent. After all, we are all Africans. [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, it seems we are all agreed  that  there  is  a
need for Africa to get together.  There  is  a  need  for  us  to  begin  to
understand each other in Africa as equals. Therefore there is the  beginning
of a shift away from looking at South Africa as the ``big brother'' of  SADC
and the rest of Africa. We should also not  encourage  a  notion  that  says
``because your economy is greater, because your military might  is  greater,
therefore you are the solver of the continent's problems''.

However, one looks at the constitutive Act of the African  Union  with  some
cynicism and slightly scared. Women are left behind in its constitution.  An
additional protocol has to be included to take care of the women,  and  real
African values.

Therefore, it is necessary for South African women in  particular,  and  for
the women of the continent to start asking themselves  what  the  advent  of
the African Union brings to them. Clearly we know that it  will  bring  more
communication in Africa, better understanding,  and  better  integration  of
Africa's cultures. It will also do the most important thing  that  we  want:
It will bring stability and peace to us all, and make us all understand  the
need to plant, to water, and to strengthen democracy in Africa.

The hon Eglin asked: ``What  does  it  hold  for  the  sovereignty  of  this
country?'' The Constitutive Act of the  African  Union  is  very  clear.  We
shall not be interfering. Is this a new thing? No, I do not  think  so.  Let
us look at where there has been  at  least  a  trial  run  of  inter-country
parliament. For instance, we can look at the Ecowas. There is  a  parliament
of West Africa, and the West African countries  as  individuals  still  have
sovereignty regarding their own affairs within their own borders. Why  would
the advent of the African Union therefore  frighten  us  and  begin  to  sow
problems even before we go into it?

The hon Makanda referred to  human  rights  development.  He  said  that  we
should also be aware that doing away with established black universities  is
not good  for  us.  We  can  argue  against  that,  because  in  fact  those
universities did not set out to produce equal  South  Africans.  [Applause.]
They did not set out to make me an equal graduate to one  from  universities
such as Wits, Rhodes or UCT. When one looks at  what  constitutes  pride  in
being African and the Africanness of these universities, one must also  look
at what, qualitatively, we have been producing from those universities  over
a long time.

Therefore, my argument would be that in fact Nepad and  the  interaction  of
African countries and diversities will enable black South Africans  to  gain
more advantages at all those  wonderful  African  universities,  which  they
were unable to gain access to. [Applause.]

When the hon Deputy Chairperson of this House referred to the need  to  give
more executive powers and for parliaments to play more of an oversight  role
in this Pan-Africanist Parliament,  I  began  to  note  that  SADC  and  our
executive have been meeting, big politics  have  been  discussed  and  great
plans have been made, which are meant to push SADC in the  right  direction.
Some of these plans are  meant  to  relieve  us  of  all  ethnic,  cultural,
economic and political conflicts. However,  we  have  failed  to  strengthen
parliaments in these 10 SADC countries.

Therefore, as we proceed with the African Parliament, it  becomes  necessary
to start looking at the functioning of parliaments  in  Africa.  How  strong
are they? If  one  gives  more  executive  powers,  how  effective  is  this
parliamentary  oversight  going  to  be?  When  one  goes  to  the   African
Parliament, one will need an even stronger oversight  role,  which  will  be
played by parliaments in Africa.

I want to make an example. The constitutive Act of  Ecowas  states  that  no
serving minister or member of a cabinet shall be sent  to  this  parliament.
Member states of Ecowas send ministers. Parliaments are not  doing  anything
because they feel that they are not strong enough to put up a  challenge  by
putting their feet down and clearly stating that, based on the  constitutive
Act, they are withdrawing so-and-so. How are going to  play  this  oversight
role?
As an African woman, I believe that the establishment of the  African  Union
spells the end of the marginalisation of African women  on  this  continent.
It challenges us as African women in this Parliament and  other  parliaments
in Africa to make our voices heard. It will make our brains deliver  for  us
what our tears have failed to do over the  years.  It  makes  it  even  more
incumbent on women  of  this  continent  to  demand  an  end  to  conflicts,
decisions taken by men on Africa, and  our  children  turned  into  soldiers
even before they want to, and enables us to unite as African women and  call
for an end to this rape that carries on  during  conflicts  and  after  they
have ceased.

As we welcome this union,  South  African  and  African  women  must  unite.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, the working  group  will  be  submitting  a
further  report,  making  some  specific  recommendations  to  the  National
Assembly before the end of this term.

Debate concluded.
                                   RULING

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before proceeding to  the  next  debate,  I
wish to rule on a point of order that was raised on  27  February  when  the
hon Mr Goniwe raised a point of order about a comment made  by  the  hon  Mr
Andrew during a follow-up question to  the  hon  the  Deputy  President.  Mr
Goniwe claimed that Mr Andrew had contravened Rule 66 by reflecting  on  the
integrity and credibility of a Chapter 9 institution in  that  he  had  said
that the arms deal investigation was a cover-up.

At the time, when asked by the Chair, the hon Mr Andrew denied that  he  had
said what he had been accused of having said. I  nevertheless  undertook  to
study the Hansard and indicated that if the words had been  a  reference  to
the report by the Chapter 9 institutions, that would be out of order.

Having now had the opportunity to study the unrevised  Hansard,  I  want  to
rule as follows. Mr Andrew's comment indeed did not refer to the  report  by
the Chapter 9 institutions and is therefore not  in  contravention  of  Rule
66, as claimed by Mr Goniwe.

However, Mr Andrew in his comment stated that the removal  of  Mr  Feinstein
and the resignation of Dr Woods from Scopa was, and I quote:


  ... because  they  would  not  be  party  to  a  cover-up  of  arms  deal
  corruption.

The direct inference is that other members of Scopa  are  party  to  such  a
cover-up. Mr Andrew's inference therefore casts aspersions on the  integrity
of members of this House in their capacity as  members  of  a  parliamentary
committee, and that is unparliamentary. I therefore ask the  hon  member  to
withdraw that remark, please.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I think the inference that is being  made  ...
[Interjections.] ... is entirely unsubstantiated by  the  comments  I  made.
For example, Mr Feinstein was not removed by members of Scopa.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Mr Andrew, the words you used, and I think you  have
the Hansard in front of you ...

Mr K M ANDREW: Yes, I do.

The SPEAKER: ... are the ones I referred to. You said ``because  they  would
not be party to a cover-up of arms deal  corruption''.  The  implication  of
``they would not be party'' is casting aspersions on other members  of  that
committee. And that is what I am asking you to withdraw.

Mr K M ANDREW: Surely, Madam Speaker ...  [Interjections.]  ...  members  of
the committee ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Mr Andrew, I have made a  ruling.  If  you  wish  to
challenge it, you may do so.

Mr K M ANDREW: Well, I would just like to address you on the  ruling,  if  I
may, because I have not been given an opportunity.  The  only  thing  I  was
asked, was whether I had used certain words or not. I said  no,  I  had  not
used those words, and you have correctly pointed out  that  I  did  not  use
those words.

The SPEAKER: Yes, I said that.

Mr K M ANDREW: I was never asked whether there was  an  inference  that  the
other members of Scopa ...

The SPEAKER: Order! No, you are not being asked now. I am ruling  that  when
I looked at Hansard, I read the full statement. So I am  not  ruling  on  Mr
Goniwe's point of order; I am ruling  on  what  Hansard  actually  says  you
said. I am then saying that those words need to be withdrawn,  because  they
are out of order. This does not refer to the  point  of  order  made  by  Mr
Goniwe. I have made clear that that was not a valid point of order.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I make it clear that there  was  no  intention
to cast an inference in respect of any members  of  Scopa,  that  they  were
party to a cover-up.

The SPEAKER: There was no  intention,  but  the  words  you  used  do  infer
exactly that.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, the words used  relate  to  decisions  of  two
individuals who made personal decisions. In  view  of  their  opinion,  they
took certain causative action. The fact that other members of Scopa did  not
take similar decisions, including members of my  own  party,  clearly  means
that they did not take that opinion on themselves, and in that  sense  there
is no inference.

The SPEAKER: Mr Andrew, by saying what you have  ...  I  am  asking  you  to
withdraw it. The reference is very clear. You  asked  the  Deputy  President
whether he did not consider that the removal of the hon Mr Andrew  Feinstein
as leader of the ANC group on Scopa, and the  resignation,  in  desperation,
of Scopa's chairperson, the hon Dr Woods, because ``they would not be  party
to a cover-up of arms deal corruption'', would  help  the  Government's  new
campaign, etc. That is a reference to the rest of Scopa members.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker ...

The SPEAKER: Mr Andrew, I am giving you a ruling.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, Mr Feinstein was not  removed  by  members  of
Scopa as leader of the ANC study group, so that cannot  be  a  reference  to
other members of Scopa. [Interjections.]  In  the  case  of  Dr  Woods,  his
resignation, a long time afterwards, was in fact as a result of ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Andrew, I am sure Dr Woods has explained the  reasons
for his resignation. It was what you said in the House that I am  going  by.
I am not reopening whether there were resignations or  removals.  By  saying
``they would not be party to a  cover-up'',  you  are  implying  that  other
members of Scopa are party to  a  cover-up.  [Interjections.]  That  is  the
basis on which you are being asked to withdraw that statement.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, are you suggesting that ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Mr Andrew, I am not suggesting anything.

Mr K  M  ANDREW:  ...  my  own  party  members  are  party  to  a  cover-up?
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Andrew,  will  you  listen  to  me?  [Interjections.]
Order! I am not suggesting anything. I have given you a ruling; it is not  a
suggestion. Please, Mr Gibson, will you take your seat till I have  finished
with Mr Andrew. I will hear you thereafter.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: The  rules  of  natural
justice would give Mr Andrew the right to address you. You  have  not  given
him a fair opportunity with respect to that before you gave your ruling.

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Gibson, take  your  seat.  I  have  given  him  ample
opportunity, more than I have normally allowed on a  ruling.  I  have  heard
him out. He says he did not mean what I have drawn  it  to  infer.  I  heard
what he said. I therefore reread the entire paragraph of what he  had  said.
I do not believe that was not natural justice. I  am  therefore  asking  the
hon Andrew to withdraw his words.

Mr K M ANDREW: I withdraw ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr K M ANDREW: I withdraw any inference in the way you have interpreted  it,
because that was not my intention.

The SPEAKER: Order! The words, Mr Andrew! You know you are not  being  asked
to withdraw an inference.

Mr K M ANDREW: Which particular word do you want me to withdraw?

The SPEAKER: That entire section. The words I  quoted  ...  [Interjections.]
Mr Eglin, I will address you later on  on  that.  The  words  I  quoted  are
``because they would not be party to a cover-up of arms deal corruption''.
Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I withdraw that.

The SPEAKER: Thank you. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Would  you  rule  about
the time in which points of order are to be taken? The point of order  which
was taken by Mr Goniwe was some half an  hour  after  the  statement  by  Mr
Andrew. My understanding is that at least the practice has always been  that
one has to raise a point of order immediately  or  at  the  first  available
opportunity, not half an hour later. [Interjections.] In the past  you  have
in fact declined points of order from this side of the House  on  that  very
basis.

The SPEAKER: Order! I am not ruling on Mr Goniwe's point of  order.  I  have
stated that it was not a valid point of order.

Mr D H M GIBSON: I am referring to the timing of it, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: The timing of it we can discuss in the Rules Committee. But  it
was when I read what was said ... I have made very  clear  that  I  was  not
ruling on Mr Goniwe's point of order. As to  whether  it  has  to  be  taken
immediately thereafter, I am prepared to discuss. I am prepared  to  discuss
it at the Rules Committee. I have no problem with that.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Thank you, Madam Speaker. What is the point of order then?

The SPEAKER: Which point of order? [Interjections.]  It's  not  a  point  of
order. I am ruling that the words that Mr Andrew used were unparliamentary.

Mr D H M GIBSON: I see. So that was not a point of order?

The SPEAKER: That was not a point of order. I noted it myself  when  I  read
the text. I made that very clear, and I then asked him to withdraw that.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Thank you, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: If you check the ruling as I read it,  and  which  will  be  in
Hansard, you will see that was made very  clear  at  the  time  I  gave  the
ruling.

   ENCOURAGING SOUTH-SOUTH CO-OPERATION TO REINFORCE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL
 EFFORTS IN CAPACITY-BUILDING IN RESPECT OF INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND
                         HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Prof B TUROK: Madam  Speaker,  South-South  co-operation  has  long  been  a
desired objective, and it is not simply a  matter  of  co-operation  between
states, but also a matter of co-operation between peoples across the  world.
However, we are now in a new context of  globalisation,  a  world  which  is
increasingly polarised between the rich and the poor. And so we have to  re-
examine the whole question of South-South  co-operation  in  the  New  World
Order. What is clear is that there can be no retreat  into  isolationism  on
the grounds of South-South co-operation, and  we  need  to  manage  the  new
situation.
In a document issued by the Government on Nepad, the following was stated:


  Globalisation has increased the ability of the strong  to  advance  their
  interests to the detriment of the weak ... It has limited the  space  for
  developing countries to control their own development.

Now while that sentiment could describe the state of the world  for  a  long
time, the present  period  is  really  quite  different.  There  are  common
interests in the South. These interests have been there  for  quite  a  long
time, and the phrase ``Third World'' was actually coined to represent  those
common interests that exist among developing countries.

The term ``Third World'' was used  to  characterise  the  exclusion  of  the
Third  World  by  industrialised  countries,  and  even  to   describe   the
domination of the Third World by industrialised countries. That is  why  the
notion of Third-Worldism was launched and why there is  so  much  literature
about the Third World.
There have been many commissions set up by Third World countries to  examine
the question of  their  condition,  notably  the  South  Centre  in  Geneva,
founded by President Nyerere, precisely to  examine  the  condition  of  the
Third World, of the developing countries, and to  examine  the  question  of
South-South co-operation. That centre has been functioning for quite  a  few
years and it has been the centre of discussion on these issues  on  a  world
scale.

Our own Department of  Trade  and  Industry  has  launched  the  idea  of  a
butterfly scenario. The idea  is  that  Africa  should  be  located  in  the
context of relations between Latin America and Asia.

The questions we have to ask are: What are the objectives of this  approach?
What are the means to fulfil South-South co-operation?  And,  what  are  the
obstacles? The latter - the obstacles - is a very important  issue,  because
people in the South know very well that there are very serious obstacles  to
South-South co-operation, and we need to understand them properly if we  are
to find solutions.
Above all, this issue of South-South co-operation should not be  treated  in
a technocratic, administrative way, but  looked  at  holistically.  We  must
look at this issue economically and socially as a political problem for  the
world as a whole.

What are the obstacles to South-South co-operation? The  first  obstacle  is
distance. We know that our attempts to co-operate with  Latin  American  and
Asia often  fall  down  on  the  question  of  distance.  We  are  different
continents,  and  the  relationship  is  difficult  to  cement  given   that
distance.

The second obstacle is language. Not long ago I was  in  Brazil,  discussing
development issues with people there. I found that  the  language  of  Latin
America is not my language. English  is  not  the  lingua  franca  of  Latin
America; it is Portuguese and  Spanish.  Similarly,  in  Asia  the  language
issue is an obstacle to South-South co-operation.

Another obstacle is the economic character of  Third  World  countries,  the
fact that nearly all Third World countries are primary  commodity  producers
and exporters. This is an obstacle to South-South co-operation.

There was a time when the question  of  skills  and  human  capacity  was  a
problem. This is not so much the case now. India, for example,  has  a  high
degree of capacity in computer  science,  in  technological  expertise.  The
same is the case in countries like Chile, Brazil and so on.

The skills deficiency is no longer a serious  obstacle  to  South-South  co-
operation. But there is a problem in that much of  the  African  continent's
skill capacity has now moved to the United States. I understand  that  there
are more Nigerian lawyers in the United States than  there  are  in  Nigeria
itself, and similarly with medical doctors. There has  been  a  transfer  of
skill from the Third World to the First World, and that is  an  obstacle  to
South-South co-operation.

It was originally thought that South-South co-operation was  a  question  of
sharing capacity, certainly especially in Africa. I want to spend more  time
on the question of co-operation within  Africa,  building  on  the  previous
debate that we had this afternoon. The notion of shared capacity  was  built
into the notion of African economic unity.

Prof Adebayo Adedeji,  a  Nigerian  who  became  head  of  the  UN  Economic
Commission for Africa and who was the author of the Lagos Plan of Action  in
1980, was also the founder of the notion of African economic unity.  He  was
driven, to some extent, by the  notion  that  there  was  too  much  foreign
interference in Africa; that Africa must  develop  its  own  momentum;  that
Africa must develop its own skills base; and that  South-South  co-operation
was included then in the  notion  of  Africa's  economic  co-operation.  The
reason for that was partly because as a Nigerian, a man of great  pride,  he
felt that Africa  must  develop  its  expertise  and  not  be  dependent  on
expertise from outside; that African economic unity meant pride in  Africa's
own capacities and its own ability to design its own plans  to  produce  its
own way forward and to operate right across the continent.

Prof Adedeji was an African nationalist and unashamedly so.  He  produced  a
document called The African Alternative Framework to  Structural  Adjustment
Programmes, AFF-SAP, which was based on the notion  of  collective  economic
self-reliance across the continent. It was  also  based  on  the  notion  of
regional integration.

He was responsible for the setting up of  the  Economic  Community  of  West
African States - Ecowas. He is also the one who encouraged the East  African
Community to come into being, as a community which was  based  not  only  on
simple things like removing tariff barriers, but on the notion  that  Africa
must develop its production base, must create  suitable  infrastructure  and
must examine the whole framework for co-operation within the  continent.  He
reckoned that this would lead to economies of scale, that it would  generate
new forward and  backward  linkages  and  that  it  would  alleviate  fiscal
constraints. The basis for Africa's economic co-operation was rooted in  the
notion that Africa is a wealthy continent.

The notion of Africa as a hopeless continent  -  The  Economist  told  us  a
while ago that Africa is beyond redemption, that it is a basket  case  -  is
absolutely negated by the statistics of Africa's wealth. Africa has  97%  of
the world's chrome,  85%  of  the  world's  platinum,  64%  of  the  world's
manganese, 25% of the world's uranium, 70% of the world's cocoa, and so  on.
It is a rich continent, which needs to co-operate, which needs its own  form
of South-South co-operation to make it work. [Interjections.]

Adedeji proposed the  following  formula  for  co-operation  across  Africa:
democratisation; an attack on and an exposure of military  rule;  an  attack
on and an exposure of dictators; better  attitudes  to  work;  work  ethics;
savings; investments;  investment  habits;  skills  development,  a  crucial
element; the improvement of social systems right across the continent.

These are the things that he raised.  It  has  to  be  said,  however,  that
Adedeji was, in many ways, a prophet. He was  in  many  ways  ahead  of  his
time, and, by and large, African leaders and the African continent  did  not
take his proposals seriously. But he persisted with them, and  it  was  very
interesting for me to be invited to a conference in Windhoek in 1994,  which
Adedeji called, in which he raised the whole question of the role  of  South
Africa in respect of economic co-operation in Africa.

He entitled the conference ``South Africa and Africa: Within or Apart?''  He
raised the question, quite provocatively, as to  whether  South  Africa  was
going to be part of Africa or part  of  the  developed  world,  the  Western
world. Our Minister of Education, Prof Kader Asmal, was there as  a  keynote
speaker. I responded to Adedeji by saying that, in 1994, South  Africa  had,
as its priority, the establishment of democracy within  South  Africa.  That
was our priority, and the question of our  position  in  Africa,  within  or
apart, was, at that moment, a secondary issue.

But it no longer is a secondary issue now, and thankfully our President  has
raised the question of South Africa and Africa, within  the  whole  question
of economic, social and political co-operation on the continent, as part  of
our contribution to South-South co-operation.

Prof Adedeji pointed out that when the South  African  apartheid  government
was in power, it tried to set up a  Constellation  of  States  in  order  to
defend its white redoubt, this  ``granite''  apartheid  South  Africa.  This
attempt to set up a constellation of states was rejected by  our  neighbours
and, instead, African governments  in  the  region  and  beyond  established
SADC. They established the PTA, they established Comesa, and  the  principle
upon which they were established was to find mutually  beneficial  political
and socioeconomic relations which would enable the continent to go forward.

Adedeji proposed, as part of that  whole  scenario,  that  there  should  be
greater access to the South African market and to other markets, that  there
should be a progressive liberalisation of the  regional  labour  market,  so
that people could move from one country to another in order to  obtain  work
to pass skills on to each other, and  so  that  there  would  be  a  greater
integration right across the continent. There should be  regional  transport
policies, infrastructure should be developed, and  I  think  that,  at  this
moment, it will be hard to deny that this process  of  integration,  through
economic processes and through social processes, is moving ahead.

Nepad is now the new Lagos Plan of Action. Nepad is  the  attempt  to  bring
unity and co-operation across Africa. It is based on the  notion  of  a  new
patriotism for the whole continent, or a  new  renaissance.  Therefore,  for
someone like me, who has been in discussion  on  these  matters  over  many,
many years, I am heartened and delighted to see that the vision of  Nkrumah,
the vision of Prof Adedeji, the vision of the Lagos Plan of Action  and  the
Economic Commission for Africa of the United Nations, is  now  high  on  the
agenda. The notion of South-South co-operation is finding a  realisation  in
the notion of a new African unity and integration. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, hon members, it was clear by the end of  1998,
in the wake of the crises in East Asia and the Russian federation, that  the
economic liberalisation and globalisation of  the  1990s  had  outpaced  the
capacity of the institutional  frameworks,  within  and  among  nations,  to
handle them effectively. The cost of crises, especially  to  developing  and
transitional economic countries, was steep. Investment  in  emerging  market
economies dipped, and has never recovered. A world of plenty  confronting  a
world of poverty is neither stable nor just.

The UN Conference on Financing for Development, convening  in  Monterrey  in
Mexico from 18 to 22 March is, in a  sense,  a  culmination  of  post-Asian-
crisis attempts to address key financial issues related to global  financial
architecture and global development.

It is, furthermore, a key opportunity to take forward the  dialogue  between
the developed and developing world  which  started  in  debates  around  the
restructuring  of  the  multilateral  institutions   of   global   financial
governance after the Asian crisis and subsequent cracks in the global  trade
system evidenced by the crisis in Seattle in 2000. Monterrey builds  on  the
UN Millennium Summit's goal of reaching specific poverty  reduction  targets
by the year 2015. It  is  clear  that  sound  globalisation  can  only  move
forward on the basis of dialogue and co-operation between the developed  and
developing world.

Development, which includes  raising  national  income,  lifting  illiteracy
rates, basic sanitation and a decent standard living, has taken giant  steps
forward in the past half-century but much more needs to be done. To  have  a
real chance of meeting  development  goals,  a  stepped-up  effort  by  both
developing and developed countries as well as multilateral  institutions  is
required. This is what the UN Millennium Summit acknowledged.

At the preparatory meeting of the Monterrey conference in  January,  the  UN
Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, endorsed the need  for  developing  countries
to have a bigger say in the management of the global economy.  This  is  the
mammoth task confronting the  Monterrey  conference  where,  for  the  first
time, the World Bank, IMF and World Trade Organisation, as well as  business
and civil society groupings, heads of state and Ministers of Trade,  Finance
and Foreign Affairs will be called upon to agree on the  wide-ranging  draft
text of the Monterrey consensus on financing for development.

The topic for discussion before the House today raises but  one  element  of
the Monterrey draft consensus. Due to the fundamental  issues  at  stake  in
Mexico to ensure the alignment of the key role-players in global finance,  I
will  not  restrict   myself   only   to   South-South   co-operation.   The
opportunities for South-South co-operation in this  context  will  be  clear
from Monterrey's clear challenges.

The International Conference on Financing for  Development  is  mandated  by
the UN General Assembly to promote international co-operation in  six  areas
that are  key  to  the  future  prospects  of  the  world's  developing  and
transitional economies: Firstly, stepping up the  mobilisation  of  economic
resources within countries; secondly, increasing  the  flow  and  broadening
the reach of private international investment; thirdly,  opening  access  to
markets  and  ensuring  fair  and   equitable   trade   regimes;   fourthly,
strengthening  and  increasing  official  development  assistance;  fifthly,
solving intractable developing countries'  debt  difficulties;  and  lastly,
improving the coherence of global  and  regional  financial  structures  and
promoting fair  representation  of  developing  countries  in  international
decision-making.

It is clear that the Monterrey draft consensus poses challenges at a  number
of levels. At the international level, this is in two respects. It  poses  a
challenge to the institutions of global financial governance and trade,  the
IMF, World Bank and the World Trade Organisation to confront  issues  around
the  inclusion  of  the  developing  countries'  agenda  in  their  agendas.
Secondly, within this context, the opportunity for South-South  co-operation
is abundantly clear, as was evidenced in Dehar, and Monterrey  will  be  the
next challenge. Thirdly, the challenge is the regional level where  regional
trading blocs and regional development banks will play a  key  co-ordinating
role  and  contribute  to  human  capital  formation  and  skills  transfer.
Fourthly, nation states that  can  see  the  fundamental  role  of  domestic
policies  and  domestic  resource  mobilisation  and  development  will   be
crucial.  Lastly,  the  global  business  community  and  multinational  co-
operations and their interactions  with  civil  society  and  nation  states
present another challenge.

The Monterrey draft consensus  underscores  that  development  is  a  global
problem requiring a global  solution  and  assigns  critical  roles  to  key
stakeholders under the co-ordinating auspices of the United Nations. It  is,
however, not only global institutions that have challenges to  confront.  In
relation  to  building  developing  countries   and   developed   countries'
consensus on financing for development, the point of departure  remains  the
role  and  responsibility  of  states  and  the  mobilisation  of   domestic
resources. It should be  noted  that  I  indicated  this  as  the  point  of
departure and not the entire and sole purpose.

As  Ambassador  John  Negroponte  of  the  USA  stated  at   the   Monterrey
preparatory meeting in  January,  development  requires  liberty,  fairness,
openness, compassion and it  requires  the  recognition  that  the  domestic
private sector, not national foreign governments,  is  the  most  efficient,
powerful and reliable source of future growth any country can tackle.

The  US  therefore  believes  that  a  major  theme  of  the  Financing  for
Development Conference should be  that  domestic  resources  are  the  basic
foundation for a country's development.  Hon  members  should  please  note:
``not the only, but the basic''.

Despite  the  crucial  contributing  role  of  trade  and   foreign   direct
investment and the respective roles of the  World  Trade  Organisation,  the
IMF and the World Bank, they remain contributing roles. While the  point  of
departure remains the mobilisation and better - and I emphasis ``better''  -
and more efficient use of  domestic  financial  resources  for  development,
these resources are finite.

In this regard, the dialogue between the United  States,  the  IMF  and  the
World Bank in relation to poverty-reduction  strategy  papers  will  be  the
cornerstone of the debates around the effective and optimal mobilisation  of
domestic resource mobilisation.

In a submission  on  behalf  of  the  regional  commissions  of  the  United
Nations, Dr José Antonio Ocampo highlighted  that  experiences  of  regional
and  subregional  financial  institutions  indicated  that  they  could   be
effective in  providing  liquidity,  sustaining  trade  links,  facilitating
access to international financial  resources  through  risk  pooling,  macro
economic policy co-ordination, peer review and the  adoption  of  regulatory
systems to regional conditions.

This combination of the regional and inter-regional approach highlights  how
regional efforts have an important role to play  in  building  capacity  and
developing human resources and the institutions  themselves,  yet  again,  a
clear opportunity for South-South  co-operation.  Examples  in  this  regard
include co-operation across developing country regional  trade  arrangements
in the recent Doha talks, as well  as  prospects  for  co-operation  between
regional development banks in terms of technical expertise.

The draft Monterrey Consensus seeks a  co-ordinated  response  to  financing
for  development,  including  the  mobilisation   of   both   domestic   and
international financial  resources,  harassing  international  trade  as  an
engine for development, ensuring debt relief  and  increasing  international
financial and technical co-operation.

But how does one unlock financial resources for development? One does  this,
firstly, by ensuring  that  the  IMF,  the  World  Bank  and  the  WTO  give
developing countries a voice by their  claiming  that  voice;  secondly,  by
mobilising domestic  resources,  including  extending  the  use  of  public-
private partnerships; and thirdly, by  creating  confidence  and  attracting
foreign direct investment, for,  as  I  pointed  out,  the  basic  point  of
departure is the domestic resources, but these are finite. And  that  brings
into  play  international  mobilisation.  Fourthly,  one  unlocks  financial
resources for development by increasing overseas development  assistance  to
0,7% of GDP  and  reversing  the  current  concerning  decline,  as  the  UN
Millennium Declaration indicates; fifth,  by  ensuring  fair  global  trade,
sixthly, by combating corruption domestically  -  this  is  very  important,
owing to the fact  that  national  resources  are  finite  -  including  the
repatriation of illegally transferred funds and the strengthening of  global
co-ordination in this regard; and lastly, by external debt  forgiveness,  as
is currently under way in these institutions I have alluded to.

What  is  required  for  Monterrey's  success?  Apart  from  the  formidable
challenge of co-ordinating  all  the  actors,  the  fundamental  determining
factor is the cementing  of  a  co-operative  development  paradigm  between
developed  and  developing  nations,  between   developing   countries   and
multilateral institutions, and among all the role-players themselves.

The Monterrey conference and the role  of  the  UN  special  envoys,  Trevor
Manuel and Michel Camdessus, must be to secure  the  future  from  financial
crisis and to ensure a co-ordinated global  push  -  and  I  emphasis  ``co-
ordinated global push'' - to finance that future. In the  words  of  the  US
president: It is time to seize the opportunity to include  all  the  world's
poor in an expanding circle of development''.

The  Monterrey  conference  and  the   World   Conference   on   Sustainable
Development in Johannesburg are integral  parts  in  ensuring  that  the  UN
Millennium Conference's millennium development goals come to  fruition,  for
they have very ambitious poverty reduction goals. The  voices  of  the  poor
must be heard in Mexico in  March.  These  voices  emanate  from  the  South
primarily, and need to be raised in unison. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, the international conference on financing  for
development which takes place in Monterrey, Mexico, in a  matter  of  a  few
days, will be laying out 52 leading actions that world leaders will have  to
give consideration to. Action number 10 out of the 52 encourages leaders  of
all nations to seek South-South co-operation.

But as the hon Prof Ben Turok has  rightly  pointed  out,  the  question  of
Third World development has attracted  an  enormous  amount  of  literature.
Therefore, we could ask the legitimate question:  What  is  new  in  putting
before this conference the requirement that there should be South-South  co-
operation?

Now, the two speakers before me dwelled on the broader  global  issues.  The
hon Turok covered the continents of Asia, Africa and also of  South  America
where all the third world countries happen to be. I would like  to  look  at
what is an important element of the Monterrey declaration  and  that  is  to
look at the sub-regional  aspect,  because  the  broader  international  and
regional aspect will have been looked at and, in this context, then look  at
what is happening within the SADC region.

The important thing about the Monterrey declaration,  with  its  52  leading
actions,  is  to  provide  world  leaders,  parliaments,   politicians   and
economists with a very useful checklist. It is against this  checklist  that
we need to see how we are placed. South Africa as a country  would  be  able
to tick off most  of  the  52  requirements  and  say  that  we  comply  and
therefore we should be able to attract  finance  for  development  from  the
various parties that will be coming forward to support  the  conference  and
the outcome of the conference.

Within the SADC region, however, many problems manifest  themselves.  If  we
focus for a moment on what is happening in Zimbabwe, we find  that  politics
there have created a great degree of diviseness, so much so that  a  country
that was once united and prosperous now finds itself in  a  situation  where
prosperity is lacking and where there was once unanimity, there is  a  great
deal of division and actually  even  animosity.  A  country  like  Zimbabwe,
which could have played and important role in South-South  co-operation  and
attracted finance development, that country  which  could  have  been  going
forward, by all accounts, will be going backwards.

Other countries in our area, such as Mozambique, Malawi and  Tanzania,  have
very serious problems when they go through that checklist of  52  items  and
they will find that they do not have capacity, the  skills,  the  transport,
the infrastructure and all the sorts of things that the two  speakers  prior
to me alluded to.

A very important area is the digital divide. In respect of  all  the  things
that need to be done, the Monterrey conference is looking  at  multi-lateral
trading. Multilateral trading requires all of us to come  up  to  speed  and
join the race, but the race  is  one,  as  the  hon  Taljaard  pointed  out,
wherein the rich nations have run so far ahead  of  all  the  other  nations
that to play catch-up is, in itself, going to  be  an  enormously  difficult
thing to do. In that situation, if we factorise the question of  a  lack  of
IT and communication capacity, it compounds the problem enormously.

So in relation to the digital divide, which is  actually  again  a  division
where the Northern Hemisphere countries, in respect of IT,  have  been  able
to maximise the use of IT, the Southern Hemisphere region has  found  itself
lagging far behind and needs to catch up on that. If globalisation then  has
to be given proper consideration in respect of the multitrading system  that
has been put into place, we recognise that  it  is  a  great  boon  to  some
countries because it is all advantage to them, but  to  other  countries  in
the south and the sub-region of Africa the question of globalisation  indeed
creates enormous pressures.

If south-south co-operation is to extend to cover  the  52  leading  actions
that are  set  out  in  the  document,  in  our  sub-region,  the  following
challenges  of  globalisation  will  have   to   be   given   very   serious
consideration  by  all  of  us,  and  these  would   be:   improving   trade
infrastructure, diversifying export capacity, increasing  the  technological
content  of  exports,  enhancing  productivity  and   competitiveness,   and
supporting trade-related training and services.

All challenges disturb comfort zones. The labour  movement  in  our  country
will also see many threats in these challenges and would like Government  to
constrain itself in committing itself  further.  Many  SADC  countries  have
neither the infrastructure nor the institutions  to  step  into  the  global
economic arena. National parliaments themselves are  becoming  in  the  main
bystanders. Increasingly, it is the executive that  has  to  act  while  the
role of parliament diminishes accordingly and correspondingly.

To add salt to the wound, the debate is increasingly becoming one  which  is
more for technocrats, not the ordinary  representatives  of  the  people.  I
think we have known for some  times  that  our  debates  in  Parliament  are
becoming fairly superfluous. We now also see,  even  though  we  might  have
doubted this, that  the  entire  world  has  indeed  become  a  tiny  global
village. Global issues are therefore pushing national  and  regional  issues
to the margins, and the polarisation between the rich and the poor is  being
exacerbated. Governments are  being  compelled  to  focus  substantially  on
international and global issues, and are bound by international decisions.

The consensus being sought at Monterrey is  essentially  to  hurry  all  the
countries along the path of globalisation and to provide as much support  as
possible to everyone who is keen and willing to  join  the  race.  Increased
resources will therefore, in all likelihood, be  made  available  to  remove
supply-side constraints and to allow world trade to become more  unfettered.
Tariffs, protectionalism, lack of competitiveness, etc will not  be  allowed
to stand in the way of world trade.

The stage  is  set  for  multilateral  financing,  multilateral  development
institutions  beginning  to  find  places  within  our  countries,  and  the
creation of awesome markets for all those who buy into the programme.  If  a
country does not buy into it, or hesitates, it will simply be  left  behind.
The coin that is being spun  has  the  same  face  on  both  sides  for  the
expanding multilateral trading systems and the countries  that  are  experts
in  it.  Therefore,  countries  will  either  have  to   join   the   system
wholeheartedly or will have to do so screaming and kicking.

The clear injunction for all of us as MPs  is  that  we  too  will  have  to
become economists  and  technocrats.  Our  financial  institutions  will  be
extremely  challenged  to   become   involved   nationally,   subregionally,
regionally and internationally. Our universities will also have  to  produce
students who understand international trade, currency exchange and  currency
volatility. Developing countries will be nursed, at least at face value,  to
have improved market access for a while.

So, the whole question of South-South co-operation is indeed  one  which  is
going   to   require   all   of   us,   parliamentarians,   economists   and
businesspeople, to rise to the challenge, and the challenge is going  to  be
an extreme one. [Applause.]

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, millions of people throughout  the  South-South
region have  a  right  to  peace,  stability,  democracy,  social  security,
freedom from hunger, ignorance, skills development and good governance.  The
challenge is to transform and democratise our institutions as well as to co-
ordinate national and regional capacity-building mechanisms.

The biggest  enemy  that  confronts  this  region  is  poverty.  Whilst  the
developed countries have crucial role to play in  assisting  South-South  to
achieve its development priorities and goals, the primary objective for  the
development of this continent lies within South-South countries  themselves.
In this regard,  I  welcome  the  growth  trend  towards  greater  national,
regional and subregional co-operation and integration.

The SADC free trade treaty attests to the importance the SADC states  attach
to the issue of economic viability.  The  ANC  election  manifesto  of  1999
states, and I quote:


  The ANC will  work  together  with  the  nations  of  Africa  to  realise
  democracy and rapid social and economic development. We shall  work  with
  the forces across the globe who share this  vision,  who  seek  a  better
  world of solidarity and caring.

Comrade President Thabo Mbeki,  in  his  book  Africa:  The  Time  Has  Come
states, and I quote:


  We believe that our region needs a radical expansion of the frontiers  of
  democratic participation if it is to tap the initiative and intellect  of
  its citizens, limit any tendency towards arbitrary  rule  and  accelerate
  the integration of the regional economy into the economy of the world.

Our President went further to say:


  Within the context of equality and mutual respect among the countries  of
  the Southern African region, South Africa poses some advantages which can
  make  it  act  as  a  bridgehead  of  development  in  the  region.   Our
  geographical location on the southern tip  of  the  continent,  with  sea
  ports on both the Indian and Atlantic oceans,  affords  our  country  the
  possibility to function as the bridge in South-South  trade  and  general
  socioeconomic interaction.


  It also provides the possibility of  bringing  together,  in  a  mutually
  beneficial way, aspirations of the developing world, especially  Southern
  Africa, and the technological and financial  capabilities  obtainable  in
  the developed economies of the world.

It is for that reason that I want  to  look  at  the  issues  of  peace  and
stability in this region, as this will contribute hugely  to  the  promotion
of security co-operation, and will lead to social stability  in  the  region
and boost investor confidence in tourism and also in our economy.

In his address at the 1998 SA Army Conference the then  Deputy  Minister  of
Defence, Comrade Ronnie Kasrils, stated amongst other things and, I quote:


  Africa has helped to  free  South  Africa.  The  SANDF,  strengthened  by
  meaningful transformation, will play its role in keeping our  region  and
  Africa stable and secure for progress, freedom, democracy and peace.

The importance of collaborative security for Southern  Africa  is  explained
in the White Paper on defence in democracy. The White Paper  further  states
that much of the  subcontinent  is  stricken  by  chronic  underdevelopment,
poverty, illiteracy,  unemployment,  acute  debt  crises  and  environmental
degradation.

A common approach to security in Southern Africa is necessary for  a  number
of reasons. Firstly, many of the domestic threats to individual  states  are
shared problems and impact  negatively  on  the  stability  of  neighbouring
states. Secondly, it is possible that interstate disputes  could  emerge  in
relation to refugees, trade, foreign investment, etc. It is therefore  clear
that challenges of collaborative security in  Southern  Africa  are  complex
and there are no easy answers or quick fixes.

The adoption of the SADC organ on politics, defence  and  security  in  1996
marked an important step in the  subregional  search  for  fostering  closer
political integration. The organ also envisages the development of  regional
mechanisms for peacekeeping and peace enforcement activities,  and  training
of national forces for peacekeeping roles.

The implementation of these aspects is being pursued  through  a  number  of
regional  training   initiatives   that   have   culminated   in   extensive
peacekeeping field exercises, such as Operation Blue  Crane  held  in  South
Africa. The protocol on politics, security and  defence  represents  efforts
to integrate national political institutions and to harmonise  their  values
and practices at a political level. The SANDF  is  rendering  its  full  co-
operation  and  assistance  within  SADC  and  the  Interstate  Defence  and
Security Committee, the ISDC, in various fields.

It also renders humanitarian assistance. The examples that I  can  cite  are
those of Tanzania, with the recovery of casualties from a  sunken  ferry  in
Lake Victoria, snowfalls  in  Lesotho  and  floods  caused  by  El  Niño  in
Mozambique.

Our defence force is also taking  part  in  peace-building  efforts  in  the
region. The members of the SANDF are now in Burundi and in  other  parts  of
the continent. The absence of human  security  in  Southern  Africa  can  be
identified as the  biggest  internal  challenge  confronting  stability  and
viability of national states in the subregion.

The issue of xenophobia needs to be high on  the  agenda  of  member  states
within the region. It has to be addressed as a matter of  urgency.  We  need
to interact at a subregional level on cultural programmes that are aimed  at
alleviating this problem. The issue of a common identity as Africans can  no
longer be postponed.

I know I do not have a lot of time, but I think  before  I  conclude  it  is
important that I address the issue of the participation of women within  the
subregional continent. The participation of women in SADC programmes can  no
longer be postponed and Parliament needs to support  these  initiatives.  As
we revisit the Montreal checklist of the 52 items, we need  to  ensure  that
the role of women is addressed and that women  are  part  of  the  decision-
making in all these processes.

Women must participate in programmes that are aimed at empowering  them,  in
programmes of good governance and in programmes that ensure  the  plight  of
women is addressed in the subregion. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson and  hon  members,  South-South  co-operation  and
regional efforts in capacity-building  are  also  closely  interlinked  with
economic globalisation.

One of the key concepts discussed at the recent economic forum in  New  York
was the present effect of globalisation on the world economy.  Globalisation
means the measure of the economic integration, across the  border  flows  of
goods  and  capital  over  political  boundaries   with   the   minimum   of
constraints.

The attack on the  World  Trade  Centre  on  11  September  and  the  recent
monetary and political crisis in Argentina in December 2001, had  an  effect
on the global economy, according to UNCTAD, an agency  of  the  UN,  foreign
direct investment declined in the order of 50% in the financial  year  2000-
2001. A substantial amount of this  was  withdrawn  from  Southern  regions,
which could also be labelled developing regions or  Third  World  countries,
as the hon Ben Turok stated here this afternoon.

Events such as the Asian crisis of 1997, the  Russian  default  of  debt  in
1998  and  money  fleeing  from  Turkey  and  Argentina,  have  resulted  in
potential investors  regarding  emerging  markets  with  a  fair  degree  of
caution.

South Africa can be categorised as the emerging market. Global and  regional
economic co-operation is a very selective phenomenon. Some of  the  emerging
countries and regions have benefited from globalisation.  Regrettably,  many
other countries, especially in the South-South region,  have  not  benefited
from globalisation.

A recent study by the World  Bank  showed  that  24  countries,  home  to  3
billion  people,  such  as  the   Philippines,   India   and   Brazil   have
substantially increased their trade to GDP over the last 20 years and  their
poverty rates have declined. It is estimated that some  of  these  countries
experienced a GDP growth rate of almost 5% in the nineties,  compared  to  a
2% growth rate in the richer and more developed countries.

It is estimated that another 2 billion people live in  countries  that  have
become less globalised and poorer. Many countries that are located  in  sub-
Saharan Africa and in Latin America find that their trade has diminished  in
relation to national income, economic  growth  has  been  stagnant  and  the
people have become poorer.

Allow me to say that regional co-operation and  globalisation  are  not  and
never were global. The shocks of 2001 have had an effect on  the  prices  of
single product export  economies.  The  prices  of  cocoa  and  copper  have
fallen, if we take the last five to six years as the norm.

It is of vital  importance  that  developed  countries  pay  more  than  lip
service and allow the liberalisation  of  farm  trade,  especially  for  the
countries  that  find  themselves  in  the  sub-South-South  region.  It  is
estimated  that  subsidies  for  farmers  in  rich  countries  or  developed
countries are worth US$1 billion dollars a day, more than six times as  much
as the developed countries' entire foreign aid budget.

It is also important to note that the World Bank and the recent  Doha  round
of talks allowed, or they stipulated, that greater exceptions  be  given  to
rich  countries'  markets  and  textiles,   and   other   labour   intensive
manufactured goods. It is calculated that more than 70% of  the  exports  of
poor countries are farm produce and textiles.  A  further  prerequisite  for
global  economic  integration  is  to  encourage  poor  countries  to  lower
barriers against each other's goods. The  average  tariff  for  manufactured
goods is four times  higher  for  trade  between  poor  countries  than  for
exports to rich countries.

The World Bank calculates that if the Doha round of talks  are  implemented,
trade in the poorer countries - many of them, again, as I have said, in  the
South-South area - can increase and can  benefit  the  people.  It  is  very
important that we get growth  in  these  particular  areas,  because  it  is
estimated that by  the  year  2015,  another  1  billion  people  will  find
themselves in the poorer, lesser developed or Third World countries.  It  is
very important that we  stimulate  the  economies  within  these  particular
areas.

Global economic regional integration will also result in  the  rich  or  the
developed world's population falling substantially. The result of this  will
be that the void left in these industrial markets  will  be  filled  by  the
migration of people coming from the lesser developed countries.

It is very important that the developed countries assist all the  particular
role-players so that we integrate the present economic order. The plight  of
the poor in the less developed countries is of great  concern  to  everyone.
More and more people today vote  with  their  feet.  Currently  millions  of
skilled people in Latin America are migrating to North America  and  Europe.
Polls in many  of  the  South-South  countries  show  people  to  be  deeply
dissatisfied with rising unemployment, failure in the improvement of  living
standards and violent crime.

One of the problems facing the Third  World  countries,  or  the  developing
countries, is that there is a continuous brain drain, and, whether  we  like
it or not, skilled people  are  a  fundamental  prerequisite  for  sustained
future economic growth. The developing world faces a number  of  challenges,
first and foremost is that of the  political  renewal.  Corruption  must  be
eliminated in these particular countries if they want to  experience  future
growth.

The second challenge is economic. More emphasis should be placed  on  skills
training. Capital is becoming scarcer and  scarcer.  There  are  no  miracle
cures. All the respective people involved in this particular regional South-
South co-operation will have to get together and plan for the future.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson, hon members, it is a privilege to  participate
in this important debate, especially with regard to the aim  of  reinforcing
national and regional efforts to create capacity-building.

I agree with Prof Turok on having our own form of  South-South  co-operation
in Africa, with special reference to our own region.

The drivers of capacity-building rest on  three  important  pillars,  in  my
opinion: firstly, on the ability to transform debt capital into  instruments
that can create  wealth;  secondly,  on  the  ability  to  provide  ordinary
workers with knowledge and skills which the  market  requires;  thirdly,  on
the willingness of a government to fulfil one of its core  responsibilities,
namely to invest in infrastructure development and maintenance.

Firstly, one of the tragedies of developing countries  is  that  we  have  a
constant shortage of  finances  for  development,  coupled  with  a  general
inability of poor people to break out of the vicious circle of poverty.  Yet
the majority of poor people possess assets, such as  home-made  shelters  in
squatter camps or tracts of land in rural areas, which  they  simply  cannot
transform into capital that can be traded freely because they  have  neither
access to capital nor a property rights system that allows  them  to  create
wealth for themselves.

Millions of poor people are simply excluded from a system  that  will  allow
them to unlock the dead capital that they have in  the  form  of  assets  in
which they have invested their hard-earned savings.

Developing nations and regions will simply have to find  a  way  to  utilise
existing  capital  in  our  society  or  region   to   promote   sustainable
development. The value of such unutilised or wasted capital probably  equals
a number of times the value of foreign direct investment in  any  developing
country or region.

The second pillar of capacity building is the availability  and  quality  of
primary, secondary and tertiary education, technical education -  continuous
education and the education of the illiterate in our society.

The development of skills has become one of the most  important  ingredients
in human resource development. The days  of  a  lifelong  secure  job  at  a
particular firm are fast disappearing. In future the value of a worker  will
depend on how much specialised knowledge  he  or  she  can  gather,  through
skills training in  accordance  with  what  the  individual  institution  or
market requires.

The value of such acquired skills will manifest itself  in  part-time  jobs,
outsourcing and subcontracting.  Our  challenge  will  be  how  to  maximise
education and skills training to build human resources and  to  retain  such
brainpower. This will allow workers to successfully engage in IT,  financial
market and entrepreneurship in the country and the region.

In conclusion, the third pillar of capacity-building is the  willingness  of
a Government to intervene in the economy in a  responsible  and  financially
calculated   manner,   through   the   development   and   maintenance    of
infrastructure. Investments in  roads,  schools,  clinics,  harbours,  power
stations, etc, should be high on the agenda of  all  spheres  of  Government
and must provide a stimulus for job creation. A  national  development  plan
designed to improve  infrastructure  and  Government  efficiency  should  be
considered.

I trust that we in Southern Africa will find  the  political  will  and  the
capacity to develop these three pillars of capacity-building.
Ms E GANDHI: Chairperson, hon  Ministers,  comrades  and  colleagues,  South
Africa, with its two worlds, one rich and well resourced and the other  poor
and deprived, is a microcosm of the North or the First World  and  South  or
the Third World. What the South faces, therefore, is  a  larger  version  of
the problems faced by  our  rural  areas  and  black  townships.  The  South
signifies countries that  are  poor,  lack  basic  infrastructure  and  have
depleted resources.

A  significant  feature  of  the  South  is  its  history  of  plunder   and
impoverishment, leading to illiteracy  and  poor  health.  Deaths  owing  to
illnesses such as cholera, typhoid, malaria, plague  and  HIV/Aids  continue
to be rife in most of the  South.  Yet  the  countries  in  the  South  have
natural resources such as  mineral  wealth,  forests,  wildlife,  flora  and
fauna, water sources, etc. But these have been plundered and continue to  be
exploited.  Wars  and  internal  strife  add  to  the  depletion  of   these
resources.

Robert Wade of the London School of Economics says, and I quote:


  Globally, inequality  is  worsening  rapidly.  Technological  change  and
  financial liberalisation result in a disproportionately fast increase  in
  the number of households at the extreme rich end, without  shrinking  the
  distribution at the poor end.


  From 1988 to 1993 the state of the world income going to the  poorest  of
  the world's population fell by over a quarter, whereas the share  of  the
  richest 10% rose by 8%. The richest 10%  pulled  away  from  the  median,
  while the poorest 10% fell away from the median, falling  absolutely  and
  by a large amount.

Kevin Watkins in the International Herald Tribune says, and I quote:


  Twenty years ago the ratio of average income  in  the  world's  49  least
  developed countries to income in the rich countries was 1:87. Now  it  is
  1:98. Life expectancy in the least developed countries is 25  years  less
  than in the industrialised ones.

In this situation, therefore, the importance of human development,  and  for
this purpose the development of institutions, cannot be  overemphasised.  It
is also important that the content  of  education  and  training  is  geared
towards the needs of the South. For  this  purpose  and  for  ensuring  that
there is a stoppage in the depletion of the  wealth  and  resources  of  the
South, South-South solidarity and co-operation are of paramount importance.

The  North  has  been  characterised  by   overconsumption,   wastage,   and
technological advancement without concern for environmental  degradation  or
the effect on human and natural life. Training and education  in  the  North
is therefore geared towards the perpetuation of this system.  The  need  for
the South to declare its own  identity,  culture,  training  and  education,
geared towards its own needs, and  on  the  basis  of  its  own  values,  is
important.

The South has to look at conservation and renew its own  value  system  that
was trashed by the colonialists, but its importance and intrinsic worth  are
seen today. An example  is  the  important  concept  of  ubuntu.  There  are
similar concepts and traditions of great value and importance in the  South.
We have  to  reclaim  these,  and  we  have  to  develop  a  patriotism  and
nationalism which will keep our people within our countries.

Our long-term development and sustainability will depend very  much  on  the
South-South solidarity. Without such solidarity we will continue  to  suffer
the plundering of our resources and the depletion of our environment.

Finally, in solidarity with my two sisters here,  I  want  to  endorse  what
Vandana Shiva says in her book on biodiversity, and I quote:


  Third World women have a special role to play at this historical  moment,
  since they pay the highest price, and are the worst victims. Women of the
  South pay the highest price for economic globalisation in terms  of  food
  insecurity. They lose the most knowledge, skills and livelihoods when new
  technologies are introduced  or  when  their  knowledge  is  appropriated
  through ``biopiracy'' and intellectual  property  rights.  They  are  the
  worst victims of civil wars, ethnic and religious violence ...


  While the women of the South bear the worst burden in terms of the  costs
  of globalisation, they also have the experience to build alternatives. We
  need to empower these women.

[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, many  of  you  are
in direct competition with the hon member at the  podium.  Will  you  kindly
lower your voices?

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, globalisation has exacerbated  the  North-South
economic disparities to the detriment  of  the  South.  Africa  as  a  whole
contributes about 1% of the world's GDP and foreign direct investment.  Yet,
the  world's  largest  accumulation  of  raw  material  is  found  on   this
continent.

Globalisation offers an  opportunity  to  sink  or  to  swim,  depending  on
whether we engage with the process or remain on the  periphery.  South-South
economic co-operation is therefore an  effective  mechanism  to  engage  the
process of globalisation so that it may yield economic  development  to  the
people of the South.  We  must  do  all  we  can  to  encourage  South-South
regional economic integration to extend production  lines  at  national  and
regional levels.  Eventually,  it  is  effective  South-South  economic  co-
operation which will ensure a  sustainable  partnership  of  the  developing
economies.

As long as multilateral economic institutions and other governmental  organs
remain largely controlled by the rich North, little development  will  ensue
in  emerging  economies.   The   democratisation   of   these   multilateral
institutions is key  to  ensuring  equitable  economic  development  between
North and South. Lack of capacity to  effectively  negotiate  transformation
of these institutions remains a big challenge to the  developing  economies.
South-South regional co-operation  will  strengthen  and  develop  capacity,
including human resources, in order to engage the North more effectively.

Unless our institutions are also  strong  and  capable,  efforts  to  engage
globalisation will be futile. But, we have no  alternative  but  to  address
our own regional weaknesses immediately. These include weak  states  in  the
form of dictatorships, the nonparticipatory nature of some governments,  war
and conflicts, and so on. Unless these are addressed, our attempts  to  have
co-operation in the South will be futile.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the world of  the  21st  century  has  become  a
global   village   with   clear   interlinkages    and    interdependencies.
Nevertheless, the cleavages,  contradictions  and  prejudices  of  the  past
continue to manifest themselves. The recent cases of the bid for  the  World
Cup and the long debate over the franchise for sherry  wine  illustrate  the
point.

The history and debate of the North-South problem is fairly  old.  It  is  a
relationship not only between the haves and the have-nots, but one in  which
the existence of the haves depends on the permanent weakness  of  the  have-
nots.

In 1980 Dr  Green  calculated  that,  whereas  $450  billion  was  spent  on
armament, development aid only received 5%  of  this  figure.  The  military
expenditure of only half a day will suffice to  finance  the  whole  malaria
eradication programme of the World Health  Organisation.  The  cost  of  one
tank will provide 1000 classrooms for 30 000  children.  The  philosophy  of
development  in  the  developing  South  must  change   our   thinking   and
orientation in very clear ways. We must move  away  from  trying  to  create
``an enabling environment to attract foreign capital''.  We  must  emphasise
domestic savings which alone will put us on  the  road  to  development.  We
need to import technology.

Foreign capital usually comes with  its  own  technology  and  exploitation,
managerial and technical knowledge. The developing South must clearly  state
that it wants  only  technology,  but  will  provide  its  own  capital  and
management skills. Foreign debt is a real  millstone  around  the  necks  of
developing countries. One analyst made this point very  clear,  saying  that
debts drain our economies of  our  savings.  Debts  are  in  many  instances
illegitimate. Also, having paid the  debt  in  the  form  of  debt-servicing
three times over in the past years, Africa is now more than three  times  in
debt over and above what she has paid already.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, the MF is in full  support  of  development
and advancement for South Africa in all sectors. The MF  also  supports  the
notion that we can learn from others.

While  in  support  of  South  Africa  building  better  relationships  with
countries around the globe, it is felt  that  we  must  bear  in  mind  that
circumstances vary from country to country. South  Africa  constitutes  part
of a varying continent, with a variety of needs and commitments  to  contend
with. Although it would be a remarkable effort to initiate such a  borrowing
of ideas, it should be kept in mind that what may work in one place may  not
necessarily work for us. We see this  internally  as  well  when  policy  is
applied, because there is a variety of results from  province  to  province.
The MF supports the idea, but is sceptical of its success.

Also, taking into account that we have recently entered  the  global  market
and that our rand has taken a beating, there are a lot of factors  that  may
hinder the pursuance of capacity-building. We have little  room  to  explore
and experiment because of circumstances.

However,  the  MF  supports  South-South  co-operation  as  a  mechanism  to
reinforce national and regional efforts in  capacity-building,  even  though
there are a lot of factors that hinder capacity-building. There  must  be  a
way around this that would influence development and  address  poverty.  The
MF is by no means  ruling  out  the  possibility  of  this  working  towards
institutional infrastructure and human resource development,  and  therefore
supports the programme. [Applause.]

Mr D S MAIMANE: Mr Chairperson, hon members, I am tempted, in  my  input  on
this subject, to expose the history of underdevelopment and development.  It
is  important  to  know  that  there  are  three  historical  phases   which
constitute the  cornerstone  of  underdevelopment  and  development  of  the
North. These three  historical  phases  are  the  mercantilist  period,  the
colonial period and the neo-colonial period.  When  we  look  at  the  three
phases,  we  see  that  they  have  contributed  substantially  towards  the
continued underdevelopment of the South.

Perhaps it is important once again to quote one of the sons of our  country,
Dr Albert Luthuli, when he addressed Oslo University on  11  December  1961.
He had this to say, and I quote:


  Our continent has been carved up by the great powers.  Alien  governments
  have been forced upon the African people  by  military  conquest  and  by
  economic domination. Striving for nationhood and  national  dignity  have
  been beaten down by force. Traditional economies and ancient customs have
  been disrupted, and human skills and energy have been harnessed  for  the
  advantage of our conquerors. In these times  there  has  been  no  peace.
  There could be no brotherhood between men.

It is the type of belief which is  reflected  in  the  words  of  Dr  Albert
Luthuli that makes me stand where I  am  in  so  far  as  this  question  is
concerned. [Applause.] All of these phases are responsible, as I  said,  for
the continued underdevelopment and poverty.

The last phase that we find ourselves confronted with  is  the  neo-colonial
period, which requires the wisdom that is contained in the Nepad  and  other
African initiatives.

Of particular importance in this regard is the  role  of  the  multinational
corporations in so far as how they relate to  our  countries.  International
institutions which are meant to provide financial and material resources  to
the developing nations of our world are playing the role  of  a  master  who
dictates the terms.

It is very important to highlight that  such  behaviour  precludes  peaceful
world order. Our region, therefore, needs to be organised in order  to  make
its voice heard in the world of nations and in order to  deal  with  poverty
and underdevelopment. Such requirements  dictate  to  us  that  we  need  to
challenge these financial institutions as developing nations.

One of Africa's heroes, Comrade Amilcar Cabral,  said  ``Tell  no  lies  and
claim no easy victories.''  We  need  not  shy  away  from  the  truth  that
underdevelopment and poverty are still there. We need not sweep  them  under
the carpet; we can still see them. It is this type of conviction that  makes
it imperative for  us  to  adopt  pragmatic  steps  which  are  intended  to
mobilise the South to have a voice in the nations of the world.

In his opening-of-Parliament address, the President,  Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki,
had this to say:  ``Decision-makers  across  the  globe  have  accepted  the
reality that the global struggle to eradicate poverty  and  underdevelopment
is fundamental to the wellbeing of human society.''

This statement is  a  reflection  of  victory  of  those  exploited  by  the
developed nations of the North. It is courageous words  of  this  type  that
compel me to believe that the ANC is the  only  movement  that  can  provide
solutions for the underdeveloped SADC region through  formal  structures  of
government.

Institutional development, together  with  its  concomitant  human  resource
development, requires the financial contribution of those developed  nations
of  the  world.  South-South  co-operation   can   better   ensure   maximum
exploitation of this opportunity. Both financial and material resources  are
needed, as I have said. It is this type of co-operation that can  place  the
developing nations of the world in a  better  position  to  be  involved  in
trade on an equal footing. Such an advantage will stimulate their  economies
and bring normality to societies in the South.

[When he is in a challenging situation like this one, a Motswana  would  say
that unity is power. We cannot allow any person to  shape  our  development.
We know our needs and we will therefore do things  for  ourselves.  I  would
like to thank President Thabo Mbeki for helping us  unite  against  poverty,
unemployment and disease. I urge the nation to follow the vision of the  ANC
and President Thabo Mbeki in building our country, South Africa, as well  as
neighbouring countries like Mozambique, Botswana and other poor countries.

The Motswana of yesteryear said  that  children  should  be  seen,  but  not
heard. When we speak of the needs of the poor  countries,  some  people  are
looking at how they can benefit from us. We  have  to  guard  against  being
manipulated by anyone.]

We attribute the successes of Nepad  projects,  such  as  the  promotion  of
peace, democracy, human rights and  sound  economic  management,  to  South-
South co-operation in  the  SADC  region  in  particular.  This  is  a  very
important step, which the developing nations in SADC have  taken  to  ensure
that there is peace on our subcontinent.

[As the South-South countries we have to be  united  in  ensuring  that  our
people in the poorer countries benefit from  our  initiatives.  We  are  not
going to let people from foreign countries tell us what to do.

We have to be very careful because there are people about  whom  it  may  be
said that our poverty is their wealth. I would like to tell  those  who  are
committed to this task, including the Deputy President, Comrade Jacob  Zuma,
that they should keep on persevering and not let anything  discourage  them.
I would like to praise him by saying that he is like a roaring lion  in  the
wilderness. He should keep up the good work. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The subject  we  debated  today
will come out once again in two international fora in  the  next  few  days,
namely the  Monterrey  conference  in  Mexico  and  the  IPU  conference  in
Marrakech. Members will, I trust, follow  the  outcome  of  these  fora  and
pursue a deep interest in the subject.

Debate concluded.
