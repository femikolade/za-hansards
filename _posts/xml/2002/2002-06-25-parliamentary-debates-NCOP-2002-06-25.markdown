               WOMEN DENIED ACCESS TO TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with dismay that the young women admitted for  terminations  of
       pregnancy at the Philadelphia Hospital in Mpumalanga, as outlined  in
       the Carte Blanche programme on Sunday, 23 June 2002, were denied  the
       treatment this government fought hard for them to have access to;

       patients at state hospitals;


  (3) encourages the Nursing Council to investigate this matter  fully  and
       apply the appropriate sanction to those nurses  responsible  for  the
       gross neglect of these patients left in their professional care;


  (4) condemns in  the  strongest  possible  terms  the  level  of  neglect
       reported, to the extent that patients were  required  to  dispose  of
       their own foetuses and clean and  fix  their  own  beds  while  still
       recuperating from treatment;


  (5) notes that the provincial department, in  its  attempt  to  stop  the
       broadcast,  did  so  in  an  effort  to  protect  the   privacy   and
       confidentiality of patients at  Philadelphia  Hospital,  and  not  to
       condone in any way the  gross  violation  of  patients'  rights  that
       occurred at this institution; and


  (6) encourages the national Minister  of  Health  and  all  her  MECs  to
       broaden the investigation  currently  intended  for  Philadelphia  to
       other state hospitals  dealing  with  terminations  of  pregnancy  to
       ensure that all patients are treated  with  dignity  and  that  their
       rights are upheld and protected.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great shock the  murder  in  cold  blood  of  five  petrol
       attendants on Monday, 24 June 2002, at a service  station  in  Grassy
       Park in the Western Cape;


  (2) calls upon the South African Police Service to do  everything  within
       its power to apprehend those responsible for this act of barbarism;


  (3) further calls  upon  service  station  owners  to  provide  a  secure
       environment for their employees; and


  (4) conveys its deepest sympathy and condolences to the families  of  the
       deceased.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

       Cape and Rev M Chabaku from the Free State on account of illness;


  (2) further notes that they are in the process of recuperation; and

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   COMPLETION OF TASK BY THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON POWERS AND PRIVILEGES OF
                                 PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Madam Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That, with reference to the  resolution  adopted  by  the  Council  on  6
  November  2001,  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Powers  and  Privileges  of
  Parliament is to complete its task by no later than 15 October 2002.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROME STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Security and
                       Constitutional Affairs thereon)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam  Chairperson,
it gives  me  great  pleasure  to  be  able  to  talk  about  our  country's
involvement and active participation in creating an  international  body  in
which persons accused of having committed acts which constitute gross  human
rights violations, which the community of peace-loving  people  and  nations
are no longer prepared to tolerate, will be tried.

On an international level, South Africa was one of the  many  nations  which
helped shape the  Rome  Statute  of  the  International  Criminal  Court,  a
process that was  preceded  by  lengthy  and  technical  legal  debates  and
sometimes tedious preparations for weeks on end.

This statute constitutes, I think, a good mix of ideas  and  legal  concepts
from all over the globe.  On  one  level  the  statute  prescribes  how  the
International Criminal Court is to function. On another it also  provides  a
framework on how the many countries throughout the world which are party  to
the statute, ought to interact with this court.  States  which  have  become
signatories to this international instrument have  committed  themselves  to
eradicating and also punishing  the  worst  forms  of  cruel  human  conduct
imaginable, namely, the crime of genocide, crimes  against  humanity  which,
by the way, include the crime of apartheid, and war crimes.

I must add at this point that, although the statute also mentions the  crime
of aggression, this crime does not yet fall within the jurisdiction  of  the
court. Article 5 of the statute provides that the court will  only  exercise
jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once an acceptable  definition  in
respect of this crime has  been  finalised.  Once  this  has  been  done,  I
imagine, the legislation  under  discussion  will  have  to  be  amended  to
include the crime of aggression.

From a domestic point of view, the Bill is also noteworthy.  It  constitutes
the culmination of a lengthy and wholesome process. After the  Rome  Statute
was  adopted  in  1998  at  the  United  Nations  Diplomatic  Conference  of
Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International  Criminal  Court,
a multisectoral committee  was  established  to  facilitate  South  Africa's
ratification of the  statute  and  to  prepare  and  promote  South  African
legislation, enabling us to comply with  our  obligations  set  out  in  the
statute.

Hon members will remember that this Parliament agreed  to  the  ratification
of the statute towards the end of the year 2000. I am pleased  that  we  are
now at the point of enacting our domestic legislation  almost  at  the  same
time as the statute  comes  into  operation.  Article  126  of  the  statute
provides that the statute will come into effect on  the  first  day  of  the
month after the 60th day following the date  of  the  deposit  of  the  60th
instrument  of  ratification  with  the  Secretary-General  of  the   United
Nations. The date in question is Monday, 1 July 2002, that  is  a  few  days
from today.

I have noted that the portfolio committee, in its  report  to  the  National
Assembly, has requested the department to try to promulgate our  legislation
at the same time as the statute comes into effect. We  shall  do  everything
in our power to try to meet this deadline.

I would like to  express  a  word  of  appreciation  to  this  multisectoral
committee for its work in facilitating the ratification of the  statute  and
for preparing the International Criminal Court Bill which was introduced  to
Parliament.  This  Bill   was   originally   shaped   by   the   inputs   of
representatives  of  the  Constitutional   Court,   namely   Judge   Richard
Goldstone, the Supreme Court of Appeal through  Judge  Pierre  Olivier,  the
Magistracy, the office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions,  the
Presidency, the South African Police  Service,  the  South  African  Defence
Force and the Intelligence Services, as well  as  the  Departments  of  Home
Affairs, Correctional Services, Foreign Affairs and my  department.  I  must
also thank the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional  Affairs  and
the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development for  their
inputs which, as always, have added tremendous value.

I have very little time to say what I would like to  say  about  this  Bill.
Allow me to highlight the aspects  thereof  which  strike  me  as  requiring
particular attention. The Bill firstly emphasises South Africa's  obligation
in the statute to prosecute in our own courts  persons  who  have  committed
the three said crimes, and only when we as country, for some reason,  decide
not to  prosecute,  to  surrender  the  perpetrators  to  the  International
Criminal Court if the court so requests. This is in line with the  principle
of complementarity which  comes  out  strongly  in  the  provisions  of  the
statute, particularly the introductory provisions. By  committing  ourselves
to prosecute perpetrators of these heinous and terrible crimes, we have  had
to create the crimes for purposes of our own  domestic  law.  We  have  done
this in the Bill by defining the crimes in the words  of  the  statute.  The
conduct which constitutes the  three  crimes  can  be  found  to  be  neatly
defined in Schedule 1 to the Bill.

Another noteworthy aspect of the proposed legislation is the  fact  that  in
certain circumstances a person can be prosecuted by our authorities  in  our
own courts even if the crimes have been committed  outside  the  borders  of
our  country.  Usually  our  courts,  it  will  be  remembered,  only   have
jurisdiction to try cases where crimes are alleged to  have  been  committed
within our own borders.

This extraterritorial jurisdiction which has been conferred  on  our  courts
allows our authorities to act against persons who have committed any of  the
three crimes anywhere in the world in the following circumstances:  One,  if
the crime has been committed against a South African citizen;  two,  if  the
crime has been committed against a person  who  is  ordinarily  resident  in
South Africa, but is not necessarily a South African citizen; three, if  the
perpetrator of the crime happens to be in South Africa after the  commission
of the crime; or four, if the perpetrator of the crime is  a  South  African
citizen or is a South African resident, but not necessarily a citizen.

This, I must add, is in line with what some other  countries  have  done  in
their legislation. Canada is a good example. However, we have  not  gone  as
far as Belgium, which, I understand, has given the Belgian courts  universal
jurisdiction. Again I note that the portfolio committee  has  requested  the
department to explore this interesting option and revert to Parliament  with
its findings.

In conclusion, allow me to express the wish that this legislation is  hardly
ever applied in practice. This is one instance where we are  legislating  in
the hope that the ensuing legislation will hardly ever be  used.  It  is  my
hope that it will deter would-be perpetrators  of  these  horrendous  crimes
from continuing with  any  devious  plans  they  might  have.  If  it  does,
however, have to be applied, I hope that it will be applied in  such  a  way
that society never has  to  contend  with  these  perpetrators  again.  This
legislation is a warning to them that they will be  treated  with  the  full
force of the law and be dispatched to prison where  they  can  languish  for
lengthy periods, if not for the rest of their lives. South Africa is  making
a statement: We are no haven for fugitives of this nature in particular.  We
have had our fair share of atrocities already. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, many countries believe strongly that  there
is no rule of law in Africa. They are saying that there is  no  respect  for
human dignity. When they think  of  Africa,  they  think  of  people  always
carrying  guns,  ready  to  shoot.  They  unfortunately   cannot   associate
democracy with us. When they think of Africa, they only think  of  wars  and
coups d'état. The unfortunate part is  that  all  countries  in  Africa  are
painted with the same brush. It is  so  because  of  the  attitude  of  some
leaders on our continent. Something must  be  done  to  prove  these  people
wrong. Obviously, no press conference will make them change  their  attitude
towards us. We can shout as loud as we want, but it is not going  to  change
their attitude. The question is, why this perception?

Let us look at what happened in Burundi. Look  again  at  what  happened  in
Rwanda, and what about Somalia? Let us note again what happened  in  Angola,
and note again what happened in the then Zaïre,  which  is  now  called  the
DRC. But let us be honest, genocide and war crimes did not take  place  only
in Africa; they happened even on other continents. Some leaders  used  their
positions to suppress opposing views. Those  who  challenged  their  leaders
were wiped out. Some were killed simply because they belonged  to  different
tribes. Some were maimed for committing minor crimes.

To make sure no leaders become power drunk, the implementation of  the  Rome
Statute  of  the  International  Criminal  Court  Bill  is  the  answer.  It
prohibits any head of state,  a  member  of  government  or  parliament,  an
elected representative or  government  official,  a  member  of  a  security
service or armed force to commit these crimes.

It  sets  out  rules  on  how  certain  things  are  to  be  done,  be  they
prosecution, sentencing or  where  trials  are  to  be  conducted.  It  also
outlines how appeals can be lodged and defines how fines can be imposed  and
so forth. It creates a framework to ensure that the statute  is  effectively
implemented in the Republic. It ensures that anything done in terms  of  the
statute conforms with the obligation of the Republic.

If we implement this Bill, crimes of genocide, crimes against  humanity  and
war crimes will be prevented. It gives our courts powers to try  any  person
who is found guilty of committing the  same  crimes.  Our  courts  can  also
adjudicate over cases brought against any person  accused  of  committing  a
crime in the Republic, and beyond the borders of  the  Republic  in  certain
circumstances. But whatever happens to South African citizens,  will  happen
with the consent  of  the  National  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions.  By
passing this Bill we are also agreeing to receive  sentenced  prisoners,  as
stated in clause 31 of the Bill.
Questions were asked by members as to whether South Africa will be ready  to
receive  sentenced  prisoners,  knowing  very  well  that  our  prisons  are
overcrowded. I think here common sense will prevail. We are not  obliged  to
simply receive them if there is no space  for  them.  Those  modalities  and
logistics will be well handled administratively.

We would like to call on all leaders  on  this  continent,  and  even  those
beyond the shores of our continent, who are not yet ready to implement  this
statute, to do so before it is too late. By implementing this statute,  they
will be proving once and for all that they are practising what they  preach.
They should just prove their critics wrong. I know they will do it. Let  us,
with one voice, say that the Implementation  of  the  Rome  Statute  of  the
International Criminal Court Bill is relevant to  our  country.  It  is  the
solution and the answer. South Africa says yes to this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the hon Kgoshi  Mokoena  conferred  upon  me  the
honour of tabling an amendment which the committee  felt  was  desirable  to
move in respect of this Bill.

The amendment relates to clause 10 of the Bill, and  in  essence  it  really
provides for certain procedures after a person has been arrested  and  comes
before a magistrate, and the magistrate has  to  determine  certain  factual
questions. In the original draft  of  the  Bill  it  only  allowed  for  the
accused person, if I could used that description, to appeal.  The  amendment
in essence  allows  for  the  prosecuting  authority  to  also  appeal.  The
committee  feels  that  that  would  be  appropriate   and   just   in   the
circumstances. There is also a small technical amendment to Schedule 2.

Both the hon the Minister and the hon  chairperson  of  the  committee  gave
comprehensive speeches, and I  am  going  to  cut  large  sections  from  my
speech. If my speech is disjointed as a result  thereof,  please  accept  my
apologies, but in the interest of saving time  I  would  rather  curtail  my
speech.

The Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International  Criminal  Court
Bill provides the legislative framework to implement  the  Rome  Statute  of
the International Criminal Court within the Republic  of  South  Africa.  In
the past illegitimate regimes sought to distinguish  between  two  important
concepts  in  order  to  retain  their  grasp  on  power.  They  sought   to
distinguish between law on the one hand and justice on the other.  In  point
of fact, they  never  referred  to  justice  as  this  was  regarded  as  an
inconvenient concept. They justified their actions, however unjust,  on  the
basis that their actions were lawful.

For the countries that are signatories to the Rome  Statute  and  that  have
ratified it, this type of defence or justification is no longer  legitimate,
if it ever was, for  the  crimes  of  apartheid,  genocide,  crimes  against
humanity and war crimes as defined in the statute.

South Africa, in conferring jurisdiction on our courts, has decided to go  a
little further than the  Rome  Statute  requires,  and  since  the  hon  the
Minister set that out in detail I shall not go  into  it  any  more,  but  I
should just note that we have gone further than  the  Act  requires,  and  I
believe that this is justified under the circumstances.

The next important concept that we need to note is that the  Bill  does  not
act retroactively, and only crimes that  are  committed  subsequent  to  its
enactment may be prosecuted. There is no statute of limitation on crimes  as
defined in the Rome Statute and for the purposes of this  Bill,  any  crimes
committed after its promulgation.

The Bill sets out the manner in which the South  African  judicial  services
will co-operate with the International  Criminal  Court.  In  enacting  this
Bill, we as a country take on a number of important  obligations,  but  also
commit ourselves to a standard  of  justice  which  we  aspire  to  for  all
humanity. The DP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, soos die naam van hierdie  wetsontwerp  aandui,
maak dit  voorsiening  vir  die  implementering  van  die  Rome-statuut  ten
opsigte van 'n internasionale straf- of  kriminele  hof,  wat  reeds  op  17
Julie 1998 op 'n VN-konferensie in Rome aanvaar is. Suid-Afrika is ook  daar
verteenwoordig.

Hierdie wetsontwerp is 'n baie belangrike mylpaal in die wetgewende  program
van ná 1994 in hierdie Parlement, aangesien dit die internasionale  rol  van
Suid-Afrika  in  die  daarstelling   van   'n   permanente,   internasionale
strafregstelsel herbevestig. Die Rome-statuut  komplementeer  die  nasionale
wetgewing van lande wat partye is tot die  statuut  in  die  vervolging  van
individue  vir  misdade  van  internasionale  belang,  naamlik   volksmoord,
misdade teen die mensdom en oorlogsmisdade. Pogings  word  steeds  aangewend
om 'n aanvaarbare definisie te kry vir die misdaad  van  aggressie  wat  dan
ingesluit sal word in die statuut.

Suid-Afrika het al reeds die Rome-statuut onderteken en, soos die  Huis  sal
onthou, op 10 November 2000 bekragtig. Kragtens artikel 126 van die  statuut
tree dit egter eers in werking nadat die 60ste instrument  van  bekragtiging
by die Sekretaris van die VN ingedien is.  Sestig  sodanige  instrumente  is
dan nou reeds ingedien en die statuut tree in werking, soos aangedui,  op  1
Julie 2002.

Die statuut kan egter nie in ons land in werking  gestel  word  voordat  dit
deel is van ons nasionale reg nie, en  is  dan  ook  die  doel  van  hierdie
wetsontwerp. Die wetsontwerp maak voorsiening  daarvoor  dat  enige  persoon
wat  een  van  die  gemelde  misdade  in   Suid-Afrika   gepleeg   het,   by
skuldigbevinding gevonnis word tot 'n boete of gevangenisstraf of beide,  of
selfs tot lewenslange gevangenisstraf. Soos wat die Minister reeds  aangedui
het, kan ons Hoër Hof se jurisdiksie ook uitgebrei  word  om  misdade  buite
ons grense in te sluit indien dit gepleeg is deur 'n  Suid-Afrikaner  of  'n
persoon wat normaalweg in Suid-Afrika woonagtig is, indien hy of sy in Suid-
Afrika is of indien die misdaad teen 'n Suid-Afrikaanse  burger  of  inwoner
gepleeg is.

Die Nuwe NP steun hierdie wetsontwerp, sowel as die  wysiging  daartoe,  ten
volle. Ons wil die vertroue uitspreek dat die Rome- statuut, en ook  hierdie
wetsontwerp wat  ons  vandag  hier  bespreek,  'n  voldoende  internasionale
afskrikmiddel sal wees ...

Die VOORSITTER VAN DIE NRP: Orde! Agb lid, kan u asseblief in die  mikrofoon
praat?

Mnr  P  A  MATTHEE:  Ek  vra  om  verskoning.  Die  Nuwe  NP  steun  hierdie
wetsontwerp en die wysiging, en  spreek  die  vertroue  uit  dat  die  Rome-
statuut en hierdie wetsontwerp  'n  voldoende  internasionale  afskrikmiddel
sal wees vir enige persoon of groep persone, hoe magtig  of  hoe  invloedryk
hulle ook al in hul onderskeie lande mag wees,  om  nie  enige  van  hierdie
misdade wat reeds genoem is te pleeg nie. Ons wil  ook  die  hoop  uitspreek
dat daardie lande wat nog nie hul weg oop gesien het om  deel  te  wees  van
hierdie statuut en die daarstelling van 'n internasionale strafhof nie,  dit
ook nou ernstig sal oorweeg  om  wel  partye  daartoe  te  word.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson,  as  the  name  of  this  Bill  indicates,  it
provides for the implementation of the  Rome  Statute  on  an  international
judicial or criminal court which has already been adopted on  17  July  1998
at a UN conference in Rome. South Africa was also represented there.

This Bill is a very important milestone in the legislative programme in  the
era after 1994 in this Parliament since it reaffirms the international  role
of South Africa in the establishment of a permanent, international  criminal
justice system. The Rome Statute complements  the  national  legislation  of
countries that are party to  the  statute  as  regards  the  prosecution  of
individuals accused of crimes of international concern, ie genocide,  crimes
against humanity and war crimes. Efforts are still being  made  to  find  an
acceptable definition for the crime  of  aggression,  which  would  then  be
incorporated in the statute.

South Africa has already signed the Rome Statute  and,  as  the  House  will
remember, ratified it on 10 November 2000. In terms of section  126  of  the
statute it will, however, only come into effect after  the  60th  instrument
of ratification has been lodged with the Secretary of  the  UN.  Sixty  such
instruments have now been lodged and the statute will come into  effect,  as
indicated, on 1 July 2002.

However, the statute cannot be implemented in our country before it is  part
of our national law, and this then is the objective of this Bill.  The  Bill
provides that any person who has committed  any  of  the  listed  crimes  in
South Africa can on conviction be sentenced to a  fine  or  imprisonment  or
both, or even  to  life-long  imprisonment.  As  the  Minister  has  already
indicated, the jurisdiction of our Higher Court is also  being  extended  to
include crimes outside our  borders  if  they  were  committed  by  a  South
African or a person normally domiciled in South Africa, should he or she  be
in South Africa, or if the crime  was  committed  against  a  South  African
citizen or resident.

The New NP supports this Bill as well as its amendments  wholeheartedly.  We
want to express the confidence that the Rome Statute, as well as  this  Bill
that we are  discussing  here  today,  will  be  an  adequate  international
deterrent ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, would you please speak  into
the microphone?

Mr P A MATTHEE:  I  apologise.  The  New  NP  supports  this  Bill  and  the
amendment, and expresses the confidence that the Rome Statute and this  Bill
will be an adequate international deterrent any person or group of  persons,
regardless of how powerful or influential they may be  in  their  respective
countries, to commit any of these crimes to which reference has  been  made.
We also want to express the hope that those  countries  that  have  not  yet
seen their way clear to become part of this  statute  and  an  international
criminal court, will now  also  give  serious  consideration,  in  fact,  to
becoming a party to that. [Applause.]]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Madam Chair, hon Ministers and hon members, the purpose  of
this Bill  is  to  implement  in  South  Africa  the  Rome  Statute  of  the
International Criminal Court. The Rome Statute was adopted by 120  countries
at an international diplomatic conference held in Rome in 1998 to  establish
a permanent international criminal court to  end  the  culture  of  impunity
that has allowed gross abusers of human rights to escape justice.
As South  Africans  we  are  extremely  proud  to  be  counted  among  those
countries that have introduced implementation legislation.  This  Bill  will
put South Africa at the  forefront  of  making  the  International  Criminal
Court a reality. From the perspective of women, the most significant  aspect
of the Rome Statute is its provisions regarding women's rights.  Articles  7
and 8 in the Rome Statute define war  crimes  and  crimes  against  humanity
respectively, and include a subparagraph listing a broad spectrum of gender-
specific crimes, including  rape,  sexual  slavery,  enforced  prostitution,
forced pregnancy and enforced sterilisation.

In addition  to  this  list,  two  other  gender-specific  crimes  are  also
mentioned under the heading: Crimes  against  humanity.  The  first  is  the
crime of persecution against  any  identifiable  group  or  collectivity  on
various grounds including gender. Secondly,  the  crime  of  enslavement  is
defined as the exercise of any power attaching the right of  ownership  over
a person  and  includes  the  exercise  of  such  power  in  the  course  of
trafficking in persons, in particular women and children.

These provisions on gender crimes are a  historic  development  for  women's
rights under international  law.  Previous  international  humanitarian  law
treaties failed to properly address sexual and gender violence. Neither  the
Hague Conventions,W  respecting  the  laws  and  customs  of  war,  nor  the
Nuremberg Chapter, contained  in  the  agreement  for  the  prosecution  and
punishment of major war criminals after World War II, included  any  mention
of sexual violence.

This inadequate  treatment  in  prior  instruments  was  duplicated  in  the
statutes of the two ad hoc tribunals which were set up for  the  prosecution
of persons responsible for serious violations of international  humanitarian
law in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. This  was  despite  the  atrocities
suffered by women in the recent conflicts in Bosnia and Rwanda.

By enacting this  legislation,  we  are  reaffirming  our  pledge  to  South
Africans and  the  international  community  that  we  will  never  tolerate
genocide and crimes against humanity, nor will we be a safe haven for  those
accused of committing such crimes.

The  Bill  will  strengthen  the   legislative   foundation   for   criminal
prosecutions in South Africa and fortify the administration  of  justice  of
the  International  Criminal  Court  by  making  the  institution  a   vital
functioning entity in order  to  combat  all  violations  of  human  rights,
including those perpetuated against women and children. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  I
want to thank all the hon members for what I consider to have  been  a  very
good debate on this statute. I note that it is joining  a  very  interesting
piece of legislation which this institution  enacted  in  1998,  namely  the
Refugees Act, so that any person  who  is  guilty  of  these  offences  will
indeed no longer be able to seek a little corner in our country in which  to
hide on the basis that they are refugees.

In other words, by means of all these legal instruments, South Africa  seeks
to make her own contribution to any international  efforts  that  are  being
made to combat these scourges. I want to underline that, because of our  own
experiences - as  I  have  said,  we  have  had  our  own  unfair  share  of
atrocities in the past - we are indeed committed to doing our  bit  in  this
neck of the woods.

I am also happy to note that this Bill, unlike the Bills regarding  which  I
came to this House last week, has not caused  as  much  tremor.  I  want  to
thank the hon members indeed. [Applause.]

Debate Concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

               ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSACTIONS BILL

 (Consideration of Bill and Report of Select Committee on Labour and Public
                            Enterprises thereon)

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chairperson, hon members of the  House,  the
Bill before the House today is one that was passed by the National  Assembly
with the support of all political parties except one.

The importance of this Bill  to  the  economy  of  this  country  cannot  be
overestimated. The  debate  around  the  issues  covered  by  the  Bill  are
followed throughout this continent, in fact, on the  African  continent,  as
well as overseas.

There has been continued public debate on the  matter  since  the  Bill  was
passed by the National Assembly. Despite assurances I gave  that  there  was
no intention whatsoever to control  the  use  of  mechanisms,  such  as  the
Internet, which are essential  for  electronic  commerce  and  transactions,
perceptions do persist, in the media in particular, that this Bill seeks  to
do that.

We have patiently asked for  evidence  on  the  nature,  the  form  and  the
content of this control that Government would have, but to date  it  is  not
forthcoming, except to say that there is a fear of Government  control  with
regard to the domain name.

There has been constructive engagement on this issue, as there has  been  on
the Bill, from the beginning. As Government we have a responsibility not  to
undermine economic development and economic  processes  that  contribute  to
such development.
Still, Government has been accused of attempting to  wrest  control  from  a
private body. An irrational fear is instilled in the public that -


  South Africa faces  the  real  threat  of  being  disconnected  from  the
  Worldwide Web, with indeterminable consequences for  e-commerce  and  the
  general economy of this country.

There is no factual basis given as to why a government so eager  to  compete
with the world would want to do this and by what means it would do this.

The fear is, as we say in Afrikaans, dat ons magte  wil  hê  soortgelyk  aan
dié wat die Gestapo gehad het, en dat Zimbabwe se  Internet  drie  dae  lank
onderbreek was nadat die regering probeer inmeng  het.  [...  that  we  want
similar powers to those the Gestapo had, and that  Zimbabwe's  Internet  was
off-line for three days after the government tried to intervene].

I cannot believe that we can be judged like the Gestapo -  wanting  to  have
Gestapo rights - and that we would want to meddle,  as  it  were,  with  the
Internet in a way that would cause the kinds of  problems  that  we  had  in
Zimbabwe.
Consequently, we are informed that the  zone  file  -  what  they  call  the
primary file - has been moved outside South Africa until the  dust  settles.
We do not know whether this is true, but true or not, I can  only  say  that
this fear that has been created  is  a  fear  of  a  democratically  elected
government; a fear similar to that which existed before the  1994  elections
when people hoarded food, candles and  the  like  because  they  believed  a
black government would bring huge chaos. Today we know that we did  not  see
such chaos.

The articulation of this fear is, as some people have said  in  the  papers,
tantamount to saying South Africans are not well versed in technology,  that
we will just let the technology that runs the Internet go to ruin.  To  some
people this is indeed an insult to all South Africans.

Many people who have been  upset  by  this  asked  that  I  check  how  many
individuals or personal names and public  places  have  been  registered  as
domain names by the current .za administrator, and whether  these  could  be
said to have been done in the public interest,  which  is  what  they  would
like to see protected.

Such a check revealed the following domain name information: mbeki.co.za  is
owned by Sean Grant of Waterkloof Glen, Pretoria; mandela.co.za is owned  by
ATP (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by André Coetzee; thabombeki.co.za  is  owned
by a foreigner in Asia; sotho.co.za is owned by United  Industries  Company,
a company of Parklands, Johannesburg;  matsepecasaburri.co.za  is  owned  by
someone in the US ... [Interjections.] ...; miriammakeba.co.za is  owned  by
a company overseas which wants  Miriam  to  pay  $30 000  to  get  it  back;
hughmasekela.co.za was, fortunately, returned to him  as  a  birthday  gift;
and domain names such as Zulu, Kalahari, etc, have also been taken. This  is
what this debate is all about. This is what has made  people  write  to  the
select  committee  to  say  that  they  have  confidence  in  committed  and
patriotic South Africans, both black and white, and in their ability to  run
South Africa's domain names.

The majority of those who have written to the committee is calling on us  to
ensure that the domain name belongs to all South  Africans.  They  point  to
the mechanisms that we have put in place to ensure  that  the  very  control
that is feared does not remain with private individuals who can threaten  us
and move the zone file, as is purported to  have  been  done,  and  who  are
accountable to no one. The work that they have done may be  very  good,  but
the point is that this should indeed  be  placed  in  an  open,  transparent
body, appointed by an open  and  transparent  public  process,  which  would
ensure accountability and resolution of any conflict.

We also cannot allow ourselves  to  become  victims  of  the  self-inflicted
paranoia of those who,  as  some  people  would  say,  are  partially  South
African rather than proudly South African. And, as our President  said  last
week, we are committed to a South Africa and an  Africa  reborn.  We  cannot
continue indefinitely  to  nurture  the  feelings  of  those  who  see  this
continent as a hopeless basket case.  We  have  to  move  forward  into  the
future, as our President said. Therefore, let us not be distracted from  our
objective.

Even the Business Day's editorial - a paper not  known  for  its  radicalism
and Gestapo-like views - of Tuesday, 4 June, states:


  Control of the domain names cannot belong to a select group of people who
  happen to be largely white. This is particularly relevant when that group
  has the ability to pull the plug on  millions  of  e-mail  addresses  and
  Internet sites.

Instead of being scared into subordination on these matters, we accept  that
we see this challenge of exclusion as an opportunity  to  move  forward,  an
opportunity to let some confront their demons  and  liberate  themselves  by
breaking out of the prison of their fears. We all  have  a  shared  destiny.
Domain names are like our national symbols. Responsibility is placed on  all
of us to believe in and promote the  intellectual  capacity  of  society  in
order to promote, collectively,  ownership  by  South  African  and  African
people on this continent of what rightfully belongs to them.

This  Bill  enables  us  to  have  a  secure  environment   for   electronic
communications  and  transactions,  whether  these  be   person-to   person,
business-to-business,  business-to-consumer  or  government-to-citizen.  Our
suggestion is that a board for a nonprofit  domain  name  agency  should  be
representative, should be drawn from those knowledgeable about the task  and
should be recommended by interested stakeholders, including Namespace za,  a
company which has been having problems with the name ``Namespace'' itself.
The Bill provides for a timeframe to allow for a smooth transition to a  new
dispensation  in  which  those  recommended  by  the  users  and   important
stakeholders can continue in the fine tradition of  efficient  administering
of the .za domain.

However, this Bill is about more than that which has  captured  the  media's
imagination. Today we live  in  a  world  in  which  all  spheres  of  human
endeavour  -  education,  health,  agriculture  and  so  on  -   depend   on
information  and  communication  technologies.  The  centrality   of   these
technologies in all aspects of social, economic  and  political  life  means
that without them, it would be difficult  for  poor  countries  to  leapfrog
decades of underdevelopment.

The Bill which I am  presenting  to  hon  members  today  seeks  to  achieve
exactly that by creating an enabling environment for the use  of  electronic
commerce to enhance growth in all the other sectors of the economy. It  aims
to provide a  platform  from  which  academics,  farmers,  miners,  artists,
craftsmen and craftswomen, Government and other sectors of the  society  can
use the Internet in trade, business  transactions  and  communications  with
the rest of the world.
We believe  that  this  Bill,  because  of  its  emphasis  on  disadvantaged
communities, will go a long way in allowing rural producers  to  participate
in  international  trade   and   commerce.   It   will   facilitate   active
participation in the rural economy, and in the economy in general, by  rural
men and women who are involved in arts and crafts and who cannot afford  the
transport to urban centres to market and sell their  products.  We  envisage
that electronic commerce will bring a large majority of our people into  the
mainstream economy.

The passing of this Bill will  also  accelerate  the  implementation  of  e-
government, which will see Government using the Internet to provide many  of
its  services  such  as  tenders,  identity  documents,  passports,  licence
applications, etc. E-government will help accelerate  service  delivery  and
access to Government information that will help people  to  help  themselves
in the spirit of Vukuzenzele, and therefore  it  will  help  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty.

The technology to  ensure  that  transactions  are  conducted  in  a  secure
environment has been developed by our  own  now  famous  Mark  Shuttleworth.
Mechanisms are put in place in this Bill to ensure that this  security  will
be implemented through  the  establishment  of,  firstly,  an  accreditation
authority and cryptography register  and,  secondly,  cyber  inspectors  who
will be appointed to monitor computer or cyber crime.

These measures are introduced because we recognise both the  advantages  and
the disadvantages of  the  Internet.  We  want  to  maximise  the  benefits.
Africa's challenges require sound and effective strategic responses to  help
Africa reinvent itself, as Kuseni Dlamini said in Business Day. Let us  rise
to this challenge.

I wish to thank the Chair and members of the select committee for  the  work
that they have done, sitting late into the night to ensure  that  the  final
Bill is in the best interests of our nation. The fruit is ripe; let us  pick
it and eat and savour it  for  the  benefit  of  ourselves  and  our  future
generations. In this way we can experience an Africa reborn. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: The next speaker is  the  hon  Nkuna.  Are  you
awake, hon member? I  understand  that  you  worked  late  into  the  night.
[Laughter.]
Mrs C NKUNA: I am, Madam Chair. Madam  Chair,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,
when the sun set on our country's abominable, excruciating  past,  the  dawn
of  the  new  era  came  about.  It  came  about  with  new  challenges  and
opportunities.  Because  of  the  shed   blood   of   our   countrymen   and
countrywomen, the light shone in the southern part of the Sahara.

I am talking about  the  rebirth  of  South  Africa  from  the  shackles  of
apartheid. I am talking about a country that  found  itself  intertwined  in
the web of the globalising  world  where  the  reality  is  that  the  haves
continue to have at the expense of the poor, because  it  is  convenient  to
continue with such a legacy.

That is the legacy we, as a nation, are not prepared to  continue  with.  We
are on board the train of progress, the train our hon President referred  to
in closing his debate, for this train is moving forward.  One  either  jumps
on board or stays behind to lounge  in  one's  nostalgia  of  ignorance  and
retrogression.

It is well known that we are  living  in  a  very  competitive  world  where
legitimate decisions can be  made  by  simply  pressing  a  button  for  the
transaction of the decision to go through. We are living in an era in  which
physical borders are eroding between countries, hence the world often  being
referred to as a global village. It is an era  of  knowledge  intensity,  in
which technology is the order of the day in order for any  democracy  to  be
successful and to have a competitive economy.

The emergence of the Internet has made possible better business ...

Ms B N DLULANE: Madam Chair, on a point of order: Is it  in  order  for  the
Minister to be alone without any officials? I would like to know  from  you,
Madam Chair. [Interjections.]

Mrs G N M PANDOR: Order! That is not a point of order  ...  [Laughter.]  ...
especially because the Minister of Communications uses  technology  for  all
communications. [Laughter.] Please proceed, hon Nkuna.

Mrs C NKUNA: Thank you, Chair.

The  emergence  of  the  Internet  has   made   possible   better   business
relationships  between  companies,  Government  and  individuals,  something
which benefits development. In  terms  of  the  South  African  perspective,
along with Government's commitment to public interests  and  the  prosperity
of our  economy,  this  promotes  public  participation  through  access  to
Government  information  and  services,  because  this  Government  is   the
government of the people by the people.

This is an era  in  which  developing  countries,  in  particular  those  in
Africa, must reap what honourable former President Mandela refers to as  the
fruits of a world that is redefining itself. We as a nation, a  country  and
a continent have to bridge the digital divide and put Africa on the  map  of
economic success so  that  this  can  indeed  become  our  century  and  the
objectives of Nepad our reality.

Globalisation offers businesses a greater market, whilst offering  consumers
more choice, variety of products  and  information.  Today  we  are  talking
about  on-line  computing  services,   Internet   shopping   and   bookings,
information services, electronic banking - the  list  is  endless.  However,
with that  comes  risks.  There  are  irregularities,  fraud  and  abuse  of
consumer confidence. This Bill  therefore  seeks  to  protect  consumers  by
providing a safe environment for transactions. It seeks to provide  for  the
legally binding effect of electronic transactions and the legal  recognition
of  data  messages,  electronic  signatures  and  electronic  evidence,  the
registration  of  cryptography  service  providers,  the  accreditation   of
electronic signature technologies by authentication  service  providers  and
the protection of critical data. That is imperative.

Most  importantly,  the  Bill  seeks  South  Africa  to  meet  international
practices and standards by creating a body that  is  representative  of  all
sectors and stakeholders to administer domain names in  the  country.  I  am
sure that even Mike Lawrie himself, who is a  South  African,  is  aware  of
this. A lot of  expensive  research  has  been  done  in  this  regard.  For
instance, in Finland  there  is  a  government  agency  called  Ficora,  the
Finnish Communication  Regulatory  Authority,  that  seeks  to  ensure  that
consumers have access to competitive and technically advanced  communication
services that are both good and affordable.  It  is  also  involved  in  the
protection  of  privacy   and   data   in   electronic   communication   and
transactions.

In Canada the Canadian Internet Registration Authority was  incorporated  as
a nonprofit corporation with the intention of managing the .ca ccTLD in  the
public interest. In  Japan  the  Japanese  Network  Information  Centre  was
formed  to  provide  an  institutional  framework  for  the  management  and
administration of the .jp ccTLD, and it operates as  a  nonprofit  corporate
association.  The  Japanese  Network  Information  Centre  continues  to  be
responsible for the supervision of nine ministries, including  the  ministry
of post and telecommunications.

Allow me to say that, in line with our position  on  providing  a  universal
service, the Department of  Communications,  through  the  Post  Office,  is
rolling out public Internet terminals, known as PITs,  across  the  country.
This means that any person can now go to the Post Office and  log  on  to  a
PIT and easily become part of the global electronic era.  Why  should  South
Africa be different? Or is it convenient for a few of us  to  continue  with
such a legacy?

It is not the intention of this  Bill  to  give  Government  access  to  the
content of the private databases. The role of the Minister is  to  prescribe
minimum standards for management, access, transfer, control and security  of
critical databases. These provisions are not unique  to  South  Africa.  The
European directives on data protection require  that  all  member  countries
lay down rules and regulations on data protection.

Other examples are the Swiss Federal Law on Data Protection,  the  Hungarian
Law on Data Protection and the US Safe Harbour Protection Principles.  These
provisions are in this Bill in the interest of  national  security  and  the
security of the citizens of South Africa.

Mr Stuart Lynn,  the  President  of  ICANN,  the  Internet  Corporation  for
Assigned Names and Numbers, said:


  Though many of the traditional Internet community ....

- he is referring to the Mike Lawries and other stakeholders -


  ... are strongly against the very mention of  government,  it  is  simply
  unrealistic to believe that global co-ordination of the DNS  can  succeed
  without more active involvement of government.

He also continued to say that ``active national government participation  is
critical to the success of ICANN''. Let me take a break  and  refer  to  the
following. Hon members should read the Financial  Times  of  24  June  2002.
There was a column in it which talked about  the  web's  internal  woes  and
about ICANN. ICANN was created as an industry that regulated itself, and  it
is now encountering problems. The corporation is  in  disarray  and  is  now
calling on governments to come to its assistance, because it no longer  sees
itself surviving on its own.

On that note I would like to congratulate the  department  for  showing  its
commitment to the development of our  economy  and  the  betterment  of  the
standards of living of our people, on  working  towards  ensuring  that  our
democracy is  globally  competitive  and  on  its  commitment  to  the  core
principles of our Freedom Charter. Indeed,  the  people  are  governing  and
will continue to govern to achieve a better life for all. The  people  shall
share in the country's wealth, and all  national  groups  shall  have  equal
rights. We fought for these freedoms and are still fighting for  them,  side
by side,  throughout  our  lives,  till  the  Mike  Lawries  understand  us.
[Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  the  growth  in
electronic trade has  created  an  innovative  market  without  conventional
rules, but with many challenges. The Bill  has  therefore  been  drafted  in
recognition of the great need for  legislation  to  regulate  e-commerce  in
this  highly  technical  industry.  We  have  addressed   electronic   trade
comprehensively with the Electronic Communications  and  Transactions  Bill.
The Bill now also ensures legal recognition and functional equality  between
electronic and paper-based transactions.

It is understandable that existing legislation, particularly with regard  to
the validity of transactions, has to a  large  extent  become  outdated  and
this can impair and frustrate  the  realisation  of  the  advantages  of  e-
commerce.  Inasmuch  as  the  Bill  removes  the  obstructions  and  updates
existing legislation so that the  validity  and  enforceability  of  digital
contracts and transactions are ensured, the Act  will  meet  its  objectives
and this is laudable.

In die wetsontwerp is daar nog  enkele  dele  wat  kan  verbeter,  maar  die
positiewe aspekte van die wetsontwerp oorskry die negatiewe aspekte. Dit  is
noodsaaklik dat ons land die voorloper en pasaangeër  moet  wees  in  Afrika
omtrent dié aangeleentheid.
Die feit dat Hoofstuk 10, wat handel oor die web-adresse wat op .za  eindig,
totaal vervang is deur 'n nuwe hoofstuk, dui op die Regering se erns dat  e-
handel in Suid-Afrika móét en sál kan werk.

Kragtens die wetsontwerp  sal  die  Regering  nou  nie  langer  die  enigste
aandeelhouer wees in 'n maatskappy wat die adresse reël nie,  maar  sal  dit
nou 'n vennootskap met die privaatsektor vorm. Dit kom dus daarop  neer  dat
die bedryf homself  reguleer  met  die  instemming  van  die  Minister.  Dié
positiewe verandering word deur  die  Nuwe  NP  verwelkom.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In the Bill there are still a few sections which can be improved upon,  but
the positive aspects  of  the  Bill  exceed  the  negative  aspects.  It  is
essential that our country should be the leader and  pace-setter  in  Africa
regarding this matter.

The fact that Chapter 10, which deals with the web addresses ending in  .za,
was totally  replaced  with  a  new  chapter,   indicates  the  Government's
seriousness that e-commerce in South Africa must and will be able to work.

In terms of the Bill,  the  Government  will  now  no  longer  be  the  only
shareholder in a company which regulates the addresses, but will now form  a
partnership with the private sector. It therefore amounts  to  the  industry
regulating itself with the agreement of the Minister. This  positive  change
is welcomed by the New NP.]

The aim of the Bill is to enable and facilitate electronic  transactions  in
the public interest, and it is  wholeheartedly  supported  by  the  New  NP.
Electronic transactions offer a multitude of benefits to small business  and
consumers, such as access to the global marketplace for goods and  services,
unparalleled speed and efficiency of transactions,  low  transaction  costs,
the ability of the consumer to look out  for  the  best  quality  goods  and
services at the lowest cost, regardless of the  location  of  the  supplier,
and the possibility of increased security and consumer protection.

It is important that  these  benefits  should  be  available  to  all  South
Africans and not only to a privileged few. It is therefore pleasing to  note
that this Bill contains the concept of  making  available  the  benefits  of
Internet connectivity to the South African population at large. The  New  NP
also welcomes the fact that the SA Post Office is  named  as  the  preferred
service provider for the Government. Sapo has over the years  built  up  the
necessary infrastructure and will therefore be in a position  to  provide  a
much needed service  in  almost  all  corners  of  the  country.  Previously
disadvantaged people in rural areas will have immediate access to a  service
provider in order to share in the benefits of e-commerce.

In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation to the Minister,  and
to the chairperson of  the  select  committee  for  the  way  in  which  she
conducted the proceedings of the committee. Open and  extensive  debates  on
the issues were allowed and it is really a pleasure to be a part  of  making
history in South Africa.

The New NP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the times  we  are
living in are characterised by convergence in the world economy,  increasing
trends towards a global market, an information  revolution  that  transcends
borders and a world that is technology driven. In  the  hon  Minister's  own
words:
  We have been rocketed into a new information society. The information has
  changed our ways of communicating with each other, our ways of  receiving
  and sending information and  new  ways  of  working.  It  offers  us  new
  potential for development and progress.

Therefore the objectives of this Bill are central to  that  development  and
progress. They are critical  to  the  development  and  empowerment  of  our
youth, for the youth are the future of this country. By investing  in  them,
we are investing in the prosperity and the future of our country.

[This Bill is very important, particularly with regard  to  the  empowerment
of women. As we all know, women have always been at the lowest  end  of  the
food chain of information, for they were expected to  stay  home  and  raise
families. This Bill therefore ensures that even women  in  the  most  remote
areas of our country will benefit from the fruits of globalisation.

Several writers and critics agree that industrialised countries  are  moving
very rapidly to take advantage of e-commerce and  realise  that  a  lack  of
skills and infrastructure could be the downfall of developing countries.]

This is very apparent in our own democracy where the majority of our  people
have no access to skills and many communities have no access to  information
infrastructure.

follows.)

[This Bill therefore seeks to change that and to place South Africa  amongst
the most competitive economies in the world.

Our democracy is part and parcel of this challenging  and  yet  enterprising
epoch in the history of the world, and e-commerce is  central  to  this  new
world order. The potential use of e-commerce for people living  in  poverty,
particularly those in rural areas, is therefore central to this Bill.]

This Bill seeks to bridge the digital divide by  developing  a  national  e-
strategy plan which must include detailed plans and  programmes  to  address
human resources and SMME development, amongst other things. I  cannot  begin
to stress the importance  of  skilled  human  resources  and  SMMEs  in  our
democracy for job  creation  and  for  their  contribution  to  the  general
economy of the country. By supporting SMMEs, we are empowering  the  nation,
and by supporting this Bill we are investing  in  our  country  through  our
SMMEs.

Research indicates that the Internet and e-commerce tools can provide  SMMEs
with access to marketing, research  banking,  training  and  information  on
business opportunities far more easily  than  before.  This  Bill  therefore
seeks to open the doors of opportunities for SMMEs to flourish.

To conclude, the spirit of commitment to the progress of  our  country  must
continue, and together we must work  for  a  better  life  for  all  of  our
people. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, it is essentially  chapter  10  that  makes  this
legislation controversial. In  essence,  chapter  10  seeks  to  nationalise
South Africa's top-level domain name administration.

During the select committee's final deliberations on this issue, I tried  to
elicit an explanation from the director-general as to  why  this  particular
course of action was being followed. Despite having to press  the  director-
general on this issue, no rational explanation was  forthcoming.  I  further
tried  to  establish  whether  the  department  had   tried   to   avoid   a
confrontation with the present administrator of the .za domain name  in  the
department. I received no direct answer to the question.

It is a matter of historical fact that the  present  administrator  has  run
the .za domain name for more than 10 years.  He  has  administered  the  .za
domain name without making a profit out of it. He has never  been  motivated
by personal gain. In 1998 he set up a committee to start drafting  proposals
for a more inclusive  administration.  I  am  informed  that  the  director-
general  was  invited  to  join  this  committee,  but,  despite  apparently
accepting this invitation, never attended a  single  meeting  in  the  three
years of drafting.

The issue that troubles me is why  confrontation  is  being  sought  by  the
department when compromise is so manifestly possible. Why  is  an  expensive
authority being set up? The only  plausible  explanation  is  that  this  is
simply an exercise in empire building.

To my knowledge there has never been  any  complaint  levelled  against  the
present domain name administrator. Nothing of this nature  was  ever  raised
in the  select  committee.  Essentially,  the  function  of  a  domain  name
administrator is to hand out Internet addresses. Why do we need to dress  it
up  and  create  an  expensive  administrative  body?  Is  it  to  dish  out
patronage? Name hijacking can be dealt with in  the  country's  courts.  Why
should the  state  and,  therefore,  the  taxpayer  pay  for  two  different
mechanisms to deal with resolution of name disputes?  The  DP  supports  the
dissemination of e-technology to all levels  of  society.  We  believe  that
Government control of the domain  name  administrator  will  not  accomplish
this.

The hon Nkuna has given examples of  top-level  domain  name  administrators
controlled by section 21  companies,  but  she  fails  to  say  whether  the
relevant  Ministers  appoint  the  board  in  their   sole   discretion.   I
respectfully remind her that the present administrator tried  to  set  up  a
section 21 company with the participation of the  department.  This  attempt
failed owing to the failure of the department to participate. I would  still
like the department to furnish a credible reason for its behaviour.

The DP cannot support this legislation.

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, maybe I should  respond  to  the  ``ags''  as
well. Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members and ladies and  gentlemen,  let
me begin by quoting from Edward  Boateng  in  his  paper:  ``  The  role  of
information in promoting economic development in sub-Saharan Africa'':


  Interconnectivity to the world via the Internet is where  the  future  of
  international commerce and finance will reside. If Africa  is  to  emerge
  from its financial and economic shambles and integrate itself effectively
  into the global economy that is where it must be heading.

By supporting  this  Bill  we  are  saying  that  we  are  heading  in  that
direction, a direction towards Africa's success and a direction towards  the
empowerment of Africa's people. With Africa's  conviction  to  bridging  the
digital divide, we are making a declaration that this is our time  and  that
this is our century.

Central to electronic technology are  consumers  who  compose  a  vital  and
significant sector. Consumers are important by virtue of their  very  nature
and  their  contribution  to  the  economy  via   electronic   transactions.
Therefore, this is one sector that cannot be taken for granted.

From existing precedents, security of consumer  privacy  and   security  and
authenticity of valuable information are of the essence  and,  indeed,  have
raised critical debate  and  concern.  Research  highlights  the  consumer's
right to security - the confidence that  information  transmitted  during  a
transaction will arrive in an uncorrupted form and will  not  be  improperly
leaked to others. Therefore, the right  of  consumers  to  privacy  must  be
protected. Assurance that a transaction will be honoured as  agreed  to,  is
essential for consumer confidence. This  right,  which  the  Bill  seeks  to
protect, is  enshrined  in  our  Constitution,  because,  according  to  our
Constitution, people are entitled to privacy.

The department's  discussion  document  mentions  the  following  which  are
crucial to electronic transactions.  Electronically  based  purchases,  fund
transfers and business deals must be as  valid  as  traditional  activities,
personal information must be  secured,  consumers  must  be  protected  from
fraud and maltreatment, and world  on-line  information  and  communications
must be at least as accountable for the quality,  reliability  and  legality
of products and services as the person in the  world.  This  Bill  seeks  to
ensure the legality of that. To further secure consumers,  the  Bill  states
that vendors must provide consumers  with  a  minimum  set  of  information,
including the price of the product  or  service,  contact  details  and  the
right to withdraw from an electronic transaction before its completion.

As stated in the Bill, the  Internet  presents  security  challenges  which,
without an effective regulatory  framework,  would  pose  a  threat  to  the
security of consumers  and  the  state.  Therefore  the  Bill  requires  the
suppliers of cryptography materials to register  in  the  prescribed  manner
their names  and  addresses,  the  names  of  their  products  and  a  brief
description  thereof  maintained  by  the  department.   This   will   allow
investigative authorities such as the SAPS to identify  which  organisations
provide  the  encryption  technologies  intercepted  by  them  in  terms  of
monitoring and interception laws.

Cybercrime has in recent years become a global  concern.  Child  pornography
and fraud have been some of the most notorious examples of  cybercrime.  The
Bill therefore seeks to make the first statutory  provisions  on  cybercrime
in South African jurisprudence. It seeks  to  introduce  statutory  criminal
offences relating to information systems and  includes  unauthorised  access
to  data,  interception  of  or  interference  with  data   computer-related
extortion, fraud and forgery. Further, this  Bill  seeks  to  prescribe  the
penalties for those convicted of offences.

To conclude, the management of electronic  communications  and  transactions
is crucial to the viability of our economy  and  consumers  are  central  to
that. Let me say that the hon Lever is not honest, because he only  came  to
one meeting, and he came because they had tried to organise  that  committee
meeting as  their  press  briefing.  They  missed  many  meetings  when  the
department was there and at which many explanations were given  by  the  DG.
We have taken note of their opposition to whatever, save to say that  it  is
wrong and it is misleading to say  there  were  no  briefings  or  that  not
enough time was given to the Bill.

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson,  one  would  try  to  be  germane  because  many
interesting points have been raised by the previous speakers, and one  would
not like to repeat most of the points because that  would  make  the  debate
monotonous.

The debate around the issue of domain name authorities  and  the  government
taking control of this function is indeed heated and extremely  complicated.
A domain authority is a highly technical  function,  and  one  has  actually
observed that the existing body  is  already  looking  after  the  universal
access to it. There can be no argument against the fact that our  Government
has a vital role to play in this whole thing.

For instance, it is reported  that  the  Internet  Corporation  of  Assigned
Names and Numbers has long called for the involvement of governments in  the
administration of domain names, and, I think, our Government  has  responded
accordingly. What is very  interesting  is  that  the  Government  has  been
accused, amongst other things, of trying to wrestle control of the  Internet
from a private body. One can only hope that this does not threaten  us  with
being disconnected from the World Wide Web, because, if that happens,  there
may be serious consequences for e-commerce communications  and  the  general
economy as a whole, but I do not think this would go so far.

There have been many arguments against this Bill. For example, it  has  been
reported   that   the   department   risks    replicating    the    existing
responsibilities in new bodies, and some say that the  consequence  of  this
would be an escalation in costs, bureaucracy, etc.

However, what is important for us is that, by its nature,  this  is  a  very
wide-ranging and highly technical Bill. Therefore, what  is  very  important
is the protection of the critical data bases.  It  is  interesting  to  note
what the Minister was saying - that most of the domain names  were  actually
owned by people overseas. That was a very interesting revelation.

Another thing which this Bill  tries  to  do,  is  to  meet  the  challenges
presented by the whole process of globalisation. I  think  it  is  important
that the Government actually does  something  about  the  whole  process  of
globalisation. This Bill actually answers just that.

In another area it attempts to give recognition to electronic  transactions,
to make  them  equivalent  to  paper-based  transactions,  which  will  help
professionals such as lawyers in profitable work in years to come.  This  is
quite an interesting development.

There is also this thing  that  there  has  to  be  a  facilitation  in  the
creation  of  electronic  communication  and  consumer  protection  in  this
regard. It seems as if the Bill is addressing that. There is no doubt  that,
once we have enacted this Bill, it will now and  again  be  amended  in  the
years to come into proper and well-polished legislation.

The IFP, in its deliberation after the study group, found the Bill to be  in
order and we heartily support it. [Applause.]

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with appreciation -


       (a)  the commendable work performed  by  the  management,  staff  and
           inmates of Carolina Prison;


       (b)  that the said prison prides itself on the remarkable  record  of
           zero escapes, zero incidents of corruption  and  a  decrease  of
           inmates' misdemeanours for the past 3 years; and


       (c)   that  the  conducive  atmosphere  around  the  prison  enhances
           effective  rehabilitation  and  correction  of   inmates   since
           community involvement is always at its prime; and


  (2) commends the management and staff for going the extra mile to  ensure
       that the prison serves its purpose to the fullest.

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chairperson, perhaps  I  should  start  with
the points that were made by Mr Lever. I was kind of  surprised  that  there
was a perception that we did not want to avoid controversy and that we  were
confrontational. I am glad that Ms Mtwanambi indicated  that  they  did  not
attend the committee meetings, because this is in fact  what  had  happened.
Indeed, a number of amendments were made to the original formulations.  What
we have asked for was totally  different  from  what  we  have  heard  here,
namely that appointments would be at the sole discretion  of  the  Minister.
Nothing can be further from the truth.

It has been agreed that we would have an open process in which the  Minister
would openly set  up  a  panel  -  everybody  knows  about  it  -  to  which
nominations would be sent by all concerned parties, and that panel  will  be
the one to look at who has been nominated, including all these people  about
whom we are talking, such as Namespace, etc.

They will make recommendations regarding  the  people  that  they  nominate.
That body will be sending names to the Minister. The Minister  will  not  be
able to pick and choose. That is the tradition that we have as a  democratic
country, to say that there must be participation of everybody and  not  just
by choice.

The difficulty we had was where we were invited as Government  to  join  the
fray when we were already planning to say that we should let everybody  know
what this thing was. The benefit of this controversy has been that at  least
we saw how little people knew.  People  everywhere  asked:  ``What  is  this
controversy all  about?''  ``What  is  this  .za  domain?''  ``Who  is  this
administrator?'' At least it has created some  interest,  but  we  have  had
overwhelming support, as has been indicated in this House.

I would also like to comment on what the hon member there  asked  about  the
absence of my officials here today. Indeed it  is  very  interesting.  Today
the majority of those  officials,  in  fact,  all  of  them  who  have  been
particularly involved in the  drafting  of  this  Act,  has  had  to  go  to
Bucharest in Romania. Why? They had to go to Romania  because  issues  about
ICANN's reform are being discussed there, because this is a body  which  has
been dominated by the United States and governed by Californian law.

So when we are asked why we need money to do  whatever,  I  can  say  it  is
precisely to contest the use of our heritage, of our  personal  names,  etc,
so that when we sit in such a body, we should be able to say what it is  the
Third World or, as people say, the developing world, wants. Therefore  South
Africa's participation was critical, particularly because this continent  is
not usually represented at such conferences, and many people had  to  go  to
this one where, as I say, they will be finalising the key issues of  ICANN's
reform and the questions around country code top level domain names such  as
the .za. That is why they are not here. It is a big battle.

Ha Basotho ba re ke ntwa ya  dibono,  ka  nnete  ke  yona  ntwa  ya  dibono.
[Legofi.] [When they idiomatically say: ``Ke ntwa ya dibona'', referring  to
a heated confrontation; the Basotho would be referring to a  real  conflict,
ie ``ntwa ya dibono''. [Applause.]]

The legal status of ICANN itself  was  a  concern  and  required  that  some
international  arbitration  be  established,  because  we   have   not   had
arbitration in South Africa. If my name has been taken, I  cannot  come  and
contest it, and that was part of our concern. [Interjections.]

Mr Lever says we must go to the courts. Can  hon  members  imagine  Matsepe-
Casaburri, as busy as she is, and even more so if she were  poor,  going  to
the courts to ask for something such as this while no one else in the  world
is called Matsepe-Casaburri?

Ke nna feela. [Setshego.] [I am the only one.] [Laughter.]]

I would have to go to the courts to go and fight and pay the court  lawyers,
and then it would go to the High Court, etc. Poor people  of  South  Africa,
or even average earners such as myself, would not be able to pay for that.

We wanted to be able to say  that  we  should  have  a  committee  that  can
protect our  heritage  sites.  How  many  of  our  heritage  sites  and  our
country's names do not belong to us anymore?

That is what spurred us in this direction. I would like to explain that  the
other members of my staff have gone to another body called  Intelsat,  which
is an assembly of parties which deal with satellite communication. They  are
not here today, because, again, it is a battle similar to  the  one  I  have
referred to, because  that  is  where  we  do  treaty-making  and  standard-
setting. People sometimes say this department seems to be a high flyer,  but
now they will understand why we are flying  around  and  what  wars  we  are
fighting, which are silent wars.

Hobane jwaloka Basotho ba tjho ... [Because, as the Basotho  cultural  group
maintain ... ] it is because nobody sees the bruises.
... hobane di patehile, empa ke ntwa e kgolo eo, re a e  tseba.  [Laughter.]
[... because they are not visible, but we know that  it  is  quite  a  great
war, that one. [Laughter.]]

So really, we are saying thank you very much for the support.  This  support
is important, because the battles that South Africa wins in this  arena  are
the ones that we win also for the continent of Africa which does look to  us
to say, ``You are even more advanced. You are the  ones  who  have  Internet
users. If you win this battle for yourselves, you win it also for us.''

Therefore, there is no issue of patronage, as the hon Lever has  said,  that
we want to dish it out. What patronage can I give through this domain  name?
It needs technical people, and there is no way  in  which  a  Minister  will
appoint people who will destroy this thing that  is  so  important  for  the
economy. There can be nothing further from the truth. We said that  it  must
be a public-private partnership ownership, because we all own  this  country
collectively. We must make sure that it progresses and thrives  because,  in
fact, this economic activity is important for our development  and,  as  has
been indicated by the members, it is  important  to  involve  young  people,
women, people in rural  areas  and  small  and  medium  enterprises  in  the
economy.

I therefore thank the hon members very much because,  indeed,  through  this
Bill and also through the hon members' own efforts, we  want  to  make  sure
that we invest in the future, and this truly makes us invest in the  future.
As Mr Adams said, it is making history in  South  Africa.  I  can  tell  the
House that with all the battles that we are also fighting elsewhere, we  are
making history  as  South  Africans.  I  thank  the  hon  member  for  that.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LABOUR AND PUBLIC
                  ENTERPRISES - LABOUR STANDARDS CONVENTION

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, the importance  of  the
role of the International  Labour  Organisation  in  the  world  economy  is
undisputed. Therefore, Convention No  144  is  of  great  importance  as  it
promotes tripartite consultations and requires member  states  to  establish
and follow procedures for effective consultations with unions and  employers
on ILO matters. That  is  what  democracy  is  all  about.  This  convention
therefore recognises the important role of good relations  among  businesses
that play a critical  role  in  the  creation  of  jobs  and  opportunities,
governments and the unions that represent workers.

In South Africa we  realised  a  long  time  ago  the  importance  of  good,
engaging  relations  among  Government,  business  and  unions,   hence  the
National Economic, Development and Labour Council - Nedlac - was  formed  as
a  primary  institution  for  social  dialogue,  dialogue  among   organised
business, Government, labour and the  community  on  issues  of  social  and
economic policy.

Nedlac's objectives  encompass  promoting  the  goals  of  economic  growth;
participating  in  economic  decision-making  and  social  equity;  reaching
consensus and  concluding  agreements  pertaining  to  social  and  economic
policy; considering all  proposed  labour  legislation  relating  to  labour
market policy  before  it  is  introduced  in  Parliament;  considering  all
significant  changes  to  social  and  economic  policy  before   they   are
implemented or introduced in Parliament; and encouraging and  promoting  the
formulation of co-ordinated policy on social and economic matters.

As nations, we need to have healthy, vibrant and productive relations  among
these spheres of democracy to prevail, so that the standards  of  living  of
our people can improve  and  our  economy  can  prosper.  We  need  to  work
together for the prosperity of our future. Therefore, the ILO is central  to
this.

In  the  words  of  Antonio   Peñalosa,   the   secretary-general   of   the
International Organisation of Employers, ``In a global economy  we  have  to
unite efforts to create wealth. Full  employment,  social  improvement,  job
satisfaction  are  unquestionably  related   to   enterprise   success   and
enterprise development.''

Article No 2 binds the member  states  of  these  tripartite  consultations,
whilst  article  No  3(2)  states  that  workers  and  employers  shall   be
represented on an equal footing on any bodies  through  which  consultations
are undertaken.

On that note, I would like to state that as the select committee we  support
this ratification and are committed to tripartite consultations among  these
spheres because engaging consultations and  negotiations  have  always  been
central to our struggles. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,

Constitution.

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LABOUR AND PUBLIC
           ENTERPRISES - OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH CONVENTION

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I rise on  behalf  of  the  Select  Committee  on
Labour and  Public  Enterprises  in  support  of  the  ratification  of  the
International Labour Convention on occupational safety and  health  and  the
working  environment.  This  convention  encourages  a  coherent  policy  on
occupational health and safety  in  the  working  environment,  as  well  as
communication and co-operation at all levels in this  area.  It  applies  to
all branches of economic activity  and  to  all  workers,  including  public
servants, with the  possible  exclusion  of  workers  in  the  maritime  and
shipping industry.

The policy seeks to prevent accidents and injury to health arising  out  of,
linked with, or occurring during the course of work and to minimise, as  far
as is reasonably practical, the causes of hazards inherent  in  the  working
environment. A total of 36 countries have already ratified this  convention.
The  convention  also  does  not  have  any  constitutional,  financial   or
organisational implications for the state.

In addition, the convention has  communication  mechanisms  in  place  which
will make it easy for the Department of Labour to consult  with  its  social
partners, should such a need  with  the  International  Labour  Organisation
arise. Therefore, we, as the select  committee,  believe  that  together  we
shall strive to realise the ideals, as set out in  the  convention,  through
awareness campaigns and the promotion  of  occupational  safety  and  health
principles as  enshrined  in  the  Constitution;  to  make  abiding  by  the
requirements of occupational safety and health legislation a  way  of  life;
to train workers and managers on safe working practices;  and  to  build  an
effective  and  efficient  occupational  health  and  safety   institutional
framework.

Therefore, we commit ourselves to working  together  constructively  in  the
interests of occupational health and safety. The  committee  has  considered
the International Labour Convention and requests the  ratification  of  same
by the honourable House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS

                            MONDAY, 24 JUNE 2002

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:


     (1)    The Minister of Transport on 14 June 2002 submitted a  draft  of
         the Road Accident  Fund  Amendment  Bill,  2002,  as  well  as  the
         memorandum explaining the objectives of the  proposed  legislation,
         to the Speaker and the Chairperson in terms of Joint Rule 159.  The
         draft has been referred to the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Transport
         and the Select Committee on Public Services by the Speaker and  the
         Chairperson, respectively, in accordance with Joint Rule 159(2).


     (2)    The Minister for Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  submitted  the
         Wetsontwerp op die Beplanningsprofessie [W  76  -  2001]  (National

     (1) First Report of the Working Group on the African Union on  Protocol
         to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community  relating
         to the Pan-African Parliament, dated 20 June 2002:


         The Working Group on  the  African  Union,  having  considered  the
         request for approval of the Protocol  to  the  Treaty  Establishing
         the  African  Economic  Community  relating  to   the   Pan-African
         Parliament, recommends  that  the  Council,  in  terms  of  section
         231(2) of the Constitution, approves the said Protocol.


         The Working Group reports further, as follows:


          (i)     The Protocol provides that, while the ultimate aim of  the
                 Pan-African Parliament is to  evolve  into  an  institution
                 with full legislative powers, at this stage the Pan-African
                 Parliament will only have consultative and advisory powers.
                 Currently there is no constitutional conflict  between  the
                 provisions of the Protocol and those of the  South  African
                 Constitution.


                 However, once legislative powers have been granted  to  the
                 Pan-African Parliament, there may be  a  need  to  consider
                 amendments  to  the   Constitution   and   other   domestic
                 legislation.


          (ii)     Parliament  should  as  soon  as  possible  consider  the
                 procedure and criteria for the composition of  the  members
                 to be designated to the Pan-African Parliament.


          (iii)   The Joint Subcommittee on the Parliamentary Budget  should
                 make provision for South African participation in the  Pan-
                 African Parliament.


          (iv)    The Working Group will proceed with identifying aspects of
                 the Protocol to be addressed through the Rules of Procedure
                 of the Pan-African Parliament.


          (v)     The Working Group will begin to give consideration to  the
                 proposed Rules of Procedure for the Pan-African Parliament.




         Report to be considered.
