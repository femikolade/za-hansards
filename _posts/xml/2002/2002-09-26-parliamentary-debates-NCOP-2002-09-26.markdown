                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, I give notice that at the next  sitting  of  the
Council, I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the recent poll by the Mass Public Opinion Institute of Zimbabwe
           which polled the views  of  Zimbabweans  on  the  presidency  of
           Robert Mugabe, and on the desirability of a rerun of  the  last,
           doubtful general election;


       (b)  that the survey indicates that 65% of respondents polled were in
           favour of President Mugabe renouncing his post as President  and
           of his immediate  retirement,  and  that  44,9%  of  respondents
           indicated that they desired a rerun of the past election;


       (c)  these expressions of the Zimbabwean people and endorses the need
           for proper democratic values to find expression in Zimbabwe; and


       (d)  the speech of former President Bill Clinton  in  Abuja  recently
           where he noted that Africa has paid a tremendously high economic
           price for the South African Government's  policies  on  Zimbabwe
           and  stands  to  lose  still  more  if  it  continues,   thereby
           effectively stunting the NEPAD initiative; and


  (2) in the light of the  above  trends,  and  in  the  face  of  economic
       collapse and starvation in Zimbabwe, calls  upon  the  South  African
       Government to drastically and urgently review its policy on  Zimbabwe
       and to make this public.

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, I give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of  the
Council, I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with  extreme  disquiet  that  the  ANC  adopted  storm-trooper
       tactics of harassment and intimidation against the DA at the Clermont
       by-election in Durban yesterday;


  (2) further notes that the ANC mobs -


       (a)  blocked a street to prevent a DA motorcade from passing through;


       (b)  ordered a DA canvasser to appear before a kangaroo  disciplinary
           committee;


       (c)  refused a DA canvasser access to certain streets; and


       (d)  stabbed a DA supporter wearing a DA T-shirt (almost fatally) who
           is presently lying critically ill in hospital;


  (3) recognises that the ANC's avowed commitment to democratic  principles
       of freedom of speech, freedom of  movement  and  political  tolerance
       vanishes when it begins to lose support and  believes  that  the  ANC
       tactics are a portent of worse things to follow.

                           NATIONAL LOTTERY BOARD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Mev die Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem dat-


  (1) die Nuwe NP en die gemeenskap van die Republiek van  Suid-Afrika  met
       groot kommer kennis geneem het  van  die  besluit  van  die  Raad  op
       Nasionale Loterye om op 11  November  2002  reeds  te  begin  met  'n
       daaglikse loterytrekking;


  (2) die sinnelose besluit geneem is ondanks geweldige teenkanting van die
       gemeenskap, kerke en ander organisasies,  byvoorbeeld  die  Nasionale
       Verbruikersforum,  wat  almal  bekommerd  is  oor  die  vernietigende
       uitwerking wat hierdie verdere uitmergeling van die publiek van Suid-
       Afrika op die armstes van armes gaan hê;


  (3) die Nuwe NP van mening is dat hierdie onverantwoordelike besluit  van
       die Raad op Nasionale Loterye kan lei tot veel meer  ellende  as  wat
       hondewedrenne in die verlede oor veral die arm  gemeenskappe  gebring
       het en waarop toe later 'n totale verbod geplaas is deur wetgewing;


  (4) die lotery in totaliteit hoegenaamd nie aan  die  behoeftes  van  die
       armstes van armes voldoen nie en die armes se sogenaamde droom eerder
       omskep het in 'n nagmerrie; en


  (5) die Nuwe NP die  Regering  versoek  om  die  implementering  van  die
       daaglikse Lotto-trekkings nie toe te laat nie, al sou dit beteken dat
       nuwe wetgewing moet kom.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) the New National Party and the community of  the  Republic  of  South
       Africa has noted with great concern  the  decision  of  the  national
       Lottery Board to start as soon as  11  November  2002  with  a  daily
       lottery draw;


  (2) this senseless decision was taken in spite of  tremendous  opposition
       on the part of the community, churches and other  organisations,  for
       example the South African Consumers' Forum,  who  are  all  concerned
       about the devastating effect  which  this  further  fleecing  of  the
       public of South Africa will have on the poorest of the poor;


  (3) the New NP is of the opinion that this irresponsible decision of  the
       national Lottery Board could result in far more suffering  than  that
       which dog racing inflicted upon particularly  the  poor  communities,
       which was later totally prohibited by legislation;


  (4) the lottery in totality does not in the least meet the needs  of  the
       poorest of the poor and has instead changed the  so-called  dream  of
       the poorest of the poor into a nightmare; and


  (5) the New NP requests the Government not to allow the implementation of
       the daily Lotto draws even if that  would  necessitate  drafting  new
       legislation.]

The CHAIPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there  an  objection  to  the  motion?
There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes notice of a motion.

                              CRIME STATISTICS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G A LUCAS: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) congratulates the Minister of Safety and Security,  Charles  Nqakula,
       on the release of the latest crime statistics in South Africa;


  (2) notes that these statistics confirm the decline and stabilisation  in
       serious crime levels as reported in the SA  Police  Service's  annual
       report which has been tabled in Parliament earlier this week;


  (3) further notes that these stabilisations and  declines  were  achieved
       within two years since the  implementation  of  the  national  crime-
       combating strategy, Operation Crackdown;


  (4) appreciates the  sterling  efforts  of  every  honest  policeman  and
       policewoman, despite the many odds and obstacles that they  encounter
       on a daily basis; and


  (5) acknowledges that these statistics are indeed concrete proof  of  the
       seriousness with which this ANC-led Government  views  crime  in  our
       country.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there an  objection  to  the  motion?
There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes notice of a motion.

                        DEATH SENTENCE OF AMINA LAWAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C-S BOTHA: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die doodsvonnis deur steniging wat gevel is op  Amina
       Lawal van Nigerië, wat buite die huwelik geboorte geskenk het aan  'n
       kind;


  (2) hierdie vonnis sonder enige voorbehoude ten sterkste verwerp;


  (3) geen regverdiging vir hierdie vonnis vind in die President se  woorde
       dat ``daar te doen is met  'n  komplekse  gemeenskap''  nie,  of  dat
       ``daar groter uitdagings in Nigerië bestaan'' nie; en


  (4) vra dat alle vroue en mans in Suid-Afrika wat verbind is tot  basiese
       menseregte, hierdie vonnis met alle middele tot hul beskikking beveg.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of  the  death  sentence  by  way  of  stoning  which  was
       pronounced upon Amina Lawal of Nigeria, who gave birth to a child out
       of wedlock;


  (2) unreservedly rejects this sentence in the strongest terms;


  (3) finds no justification for this sentence in the President's words  to
       the effect that we are ``dealing with a complex community''  or  that
       ``there are greater challenges in Nigeria''; and


  (4) urges all women and men in South Africa who are  committed  to  basic
       human rights to fight against this sentence with  all  the  means  at
       their disposal.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion? There  is
an objection.

Mr G A LUCAS: Just  for  clarity's  sake,  Chairperson.  There  has  been  a
similar motion at some stage in this Council before.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: There has been a motion of  that  nature  moved
in the House. We will certainly look at the record and deal with it  at  the
next sitting. I would like to ask the staff to check that up in  the  course
of this session, so that we could return to this motion  to  decide  it.  We
will return to that later.

                             ATHLETICS WORLD CUP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) lauds the contributions of South African  gold  medal  winners,  high
       jumper Hestrie Cloete and pole vaulter Ockert Brits, at the World Cup
       athletics championships that was held  in  Madrid,  Spain,  over  the
       weekend;


  (2) notes that their performances proved crucial in  ensuring  that  Team
       Africa won a unique fourth World Cup, despite  the  absence  of  star
       African athletes who opted instead to participate in European  events
       for greater financial rewards;


  (3) further notes that this victory is testimony that as Africans,  black
       and white  united,  we  are  indeed  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with
       regardless of the challenges before us; and


  (4) expresses the hope that this World Cup triumph and the  publicity  it
       has  generated  on  the  continent,  will  go  a  long  way   towards
       contributing  to  the  African  Renaissance   and   forging   African
       solidarity.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             DURBAN EXTRAVAGANZA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the  first  Celebrate  Durban  extravaganza  which  was
       launched last Friday;


  (2) also notes that -
       (a)  the focus during the week-long festival is on fun - lots of it -
           arts and culture, sport and business opportunities;


       (b)  business and political representatives from Durban's five sister
           cities - Leeds,  Rotterdam,  Chicago,  Guangzhou  in  China  and
           Bulawayo in Zimbabwe - are all  meeting  in  Durban  with  their
           Durban  counterparts  to  continue  developing  their   mutually
           beneficial relations;


       (c)  the theme of the festival is "eThekwini: Where the World Meets";
           and


       (d)  Durban has adopted a special catchy slogan, namely Sharp Zinto -
           often used by the young to suggest enthusiasm - which means that
           something is spot-on, Zinto coming from the Zulu word ``izinto''
           meaning ``things'', thus Sharp Zinto meaning ``good things'';


  (3) congratulates Mayor Obed Mlaba and Durban on this positive initiative
       which will bring in new business,  boost  educational,  cultural  and
       sporting links and benefit many thousands of lives; and


  (4) encourages other South African cities to follow the  example  set  by
       Durban in coming up with initiatives which will bring in new business
       and boost their international links with  a  view  to  improving  the
       lives of their citizens.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr A E VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  just  on  a  point  of  clarity:  Is  it
parliamentary to allow free promotions in this House? [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is it parliamentary? As far as I  am  aware  of
the Rules, I do not recall a prohibition, but I would believe  that  members
are not here to train as advertisers in this House. Marketing may not  be  a
strength.  I  also  must  comment  that,  given  our  debate   recently   on
multilingualism, it appears the hon Matthee is  promoting  tsotsi  fanagalo!
[Laughter.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE IN NEPAD

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) recognises the  leading  role  played  by  our  President  in  giving
       prominence and leadership to the Nepad initiative;


  (2) recognises  his  sterling  contribution  and  success  in  mobilising
       nations in the United Nations to support the Nepad initiative,  which
       is aimed at the eradication of poverty and  the  enhancement  of  the
       quality of the lives of African citizens;


  (3) notes with pride the establishment of an African identity;


  (4)  recognises  the  perennial  leadership  of  our  President,   former
       President Mandela and Deputy President in their initiatives to  bring
       peace and stability to the areas of conflict in the continent;


  (5) further notes the role of our President in promoting multi-lateralism
       and his  passionate  commitment  to  seeking  dialogue  and  peaceful
       solutions to conflict; and


  (6) therefore commends the President on his eminent leadership, which has
       made South Africa an important nation in the  world,  and  urges  our
       President to continue in the same vein.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?

Ms C BOTHA: Madam Chair, I would like to propose an amendment.

In the light of the above, I wish to have it  added  that  it  is  extremely
regrettable that the President's attitude towards Zimbabwe is having a  very
negative influence on Nepad worldwide. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! The motion was proposed by Mr Surty.  We
will ask Mr Surty whether he has any objections.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: I certainly do, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We therefore proceed to the motion as  read  by
Mr Surty. Is there any objection to that motion? There is an objection.  The
motion will therefore become a notice of motion.
                          HERITAGE DAY CELEBRATIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chaiperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


   (1)      notes with concern and dismay the sparse attendance at  Heritage
        celebrations in the country by many  South  Africans  of  Caucasian
        backgrounds;


   (2)      notes that they do not attend even when events  are  brought  to
        their area;


   (3)      asks for how  long  do  we  have  to  cringe,  beg,  cajole  and
        sacrifice to bring them and their children to the new South  Africa
        where they are needed, welcomed and have a right to be; and


   (4)      resolves to seek ways -


         (a)     of bottling up resentment at their absence; and


         (b)     of encouraging their future participation and inclusion  in
              future events.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there  any  objection  to  that  motion?  An
amendment?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I would  like  to  move  as  an  amendment:
That, in paragraph (1), ``some'' be inserted before ''Heritage''.

Rev M CHABAKU: Hon member, I heard your amendment. I reluctantly accept  it,
even though, with your permission, I may add  something  that  I  forgot  to
mention. There is a small number of South Africans of Caucasian  backgrounds
that attend. I would acknowledge that.

That, in paragraph (1), "some" be inserted before "Heritage".


Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.


Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely: That the Council -


     (1)    notes with concern and dismay  the  sparse  attendance  at  some
         Heritage celebrations in the country  by  many  South  Africans  of
         Caucasian backgrounds;


     (2)    notes that they do not attend even when events  are  brought  to
         their area;


     (3)    asks for how  long  do  we  have  to  cringe,  beg,  cajole  and
         sacrifice to bring them and their children to the new South  Africa
         where they are needed, welcomed and have a right to be; and


     (4)    resolves to seek ways -


         (a)     of bottling up resentment at their absence; and


         (b)     encouraging their future  participation  and  inclusion  in
              future events.

               APPOINTMENT OF M L MUSHWANA AS PUBLIC PROTECTOR

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Deputy Chairperson  of  the  Council,  Mr  Lawrence
       Mushwana, following the decision  by  the  members  of  the  National
       Assembly today to recommend him to the President of South Africa  for
       appointment to the high office of Public Protector;


  (2) notes that Mr Mushwana has proved beyond all doubt that he is  a  man
       of  integrity  and  that  he  meets  all  the  requirements  of   the
       Constitution for this position; and


  (3) wishes him well.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Although I have to  put  the  motion,
   the House will understand that I do not support it. [Laughter.] Is  there
   any objection to the motion? [Laughter.] There is no  objection  and  the
   motion is therefore agreed to. It is a motion  of  congratulations  on  a
   recommendation, as I understand  it,  which  is  all  that  the  National
   Assembly has at the moment.

 RACISM AND UNFAIR DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES IN THE POLICE FORCE OF THE VAAL
                                    AREA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:
   That the Council -


   (1)      notes the racial  tensions  and  allegations  of  discrimination
        within the police force in the Vaal area;


   (2)       further  notes  that  allegations  of  racism  and  the  unfair
        distribution of resources by the Vaalrand police area  office  have
        led to divisions among the senior police personnel in the area;


   (3)      believes that the seriousness of the matter led to the  Ministry
        calling  for  an  exhaustive  investigation   after   the   Gauteng
        Department of Safety and Security  revealed  that  township  police
        stations were underresourced compared to those in the white  areas;
        and


   (4)      therefore commends the Minister for working hard to fight racial
        tensions and unfair discrimination in our country.


Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          MANUAL COUNTING OF VOTES

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the arithmetical challenges  of  counting  votes  are  not
       unique to this Council, the whips in  the  other  House  are  equally
       challenged in terms  of  counting,  as  was  evidenced  earlier  this
       afternoon;


  (2) expresses its profound gratitude  for  the  electronic  system  which
       enables efficient counting; and


  (3) wishes that the electronic system be corrected swiftly in  the  other
       House to assist the whips who, like us, were not very comfortable  in
       this very challenging task.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             STATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL

      (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Local
                   Government and Administration thereon)

The MINISTER FOR THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Chairperson,  I
would like to thank this House for  this  opportunity  and  it  is  quite  a
pleasure to come to a place where there  is  a  good  system,  especially  a
system of such levels of technology. It clearly shows that this  House  will
support the State Information Technology Agency Amendment  Bill  because  it
will clearly ensure that Sita also plays a role in  assisting  the  National
Assembly  through  procurement  to  get  its  act  together  around  the  IT
requirements there.

This afternoon we are going to discuss the Sita Amendment Bill and  we  will
deal with and reflect on the challenges that  were  there  in  the  area  of
information technology across  Government  as  a  whole;  secondly,  I  will
reflect on  the  nature  of  interventions  that  we  have  made  since  the
introduction of the  Sita  Act  itself;  thirdly,  I  will  reflect  on  the
changes, on the amendment to the legislation that is required  in  order  to
align the restructuring, which had taken place within Sita  itself,  to  the
legislation;  and  then  finally,  I  will  just  briefly   look   at   some
implications of this amendment.

We  are  all  aware  of  the  Presidential  Review  Commission  Report  that
highlighted, prior to 1999, some of the complexities  in  the  area  of  the
information  technology  environment  within  Government.  Among  the  major
issues that were identified then - and many  of  these  issues  still  apply
today - is the fact that Government without doubt is the biggest spender  on
IT in South Africa. When we looked at the return on investment or the  value
added to Government services, as well  as  the  value  to  citizens  in  our
country  as  whole,  it  was  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  measure.
Departments were operating  in  an  IT  vacuum,  there  was  duplication  of
applications and systems; the benefits of  co-ordination,  co-operation  and
the opportunity to share from experience were wasted.

In short, we did not utilise economies of scale as required with respect  to
IT. The departments, both nationally and  provincially,  also  acted  in  an
autonomous manner and we saw major fragmentation there. They  did  not  take
into consideration the  information  about  persons,  either  individual  or
legal, and there was no consideration that we needed interoperability:  that
information needed to be shared between  departments  across  provinces  and
national Government and so forth.

The systems developed by departments did not allow for the easy  interchange
of information. I am sure that as we look at dealing  with  the  problem  in
the NA, we are going to allow for  interchangeability  between  the  systems
that there are in the NCOP and NA, so that we can learn  from  this  House's
passing this piece of legislation as well as the Chamber's  state-of-the-art
ICT equipment. We shall see that we take that into account. One of the  most
important considerations in a Government IT system  is  to  ensure  that  it
conforms to the security standards required by  Government,  because  we  do
not want illegal access to our information as well as to our systems.

The current Act  does  not  allow  Sita  to  address  these  problems  in  a
streamlined and focused way and hence we needed to do  something  about  it.
An in-depth analysis of the structure, task and  organisation  of  Sita  was
undertaken during the year 2000. We  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  the
structure of Sita had to be aligned, not only to meet  the  demands  of  its
clients, but also to address the shortcomings that I  referred  to  earlier,
that were clearly identified by the Presidential Review Commission Report.

The restructuring of Sita without amending the current Act would be a  waste
of taxpayers' money and I do not think that any of us  who  are  serving  in
this Parliament would want to let that happen, and we also do  not  want  to
have a waste of human resources and effort. Sita has to be empowered to  act
firmly with the necessary flexibility and freedom to achieve  the  IT  House
of Values and that  is,  user  and  citizen  convenience  through  increased
productivity at minimum cost and maximum efficiency. It  must  be  based  on
the  three  pillars  of  security,  interoperability  and   elimination   of
duplication, and achieving economies of scales.

This house of values had to be built on the  foundation  of  a  very  highly
skilled core of  performance-oriented  personnel.  Today  I  would  like  to
emphasise  that  the  current  Act  calls  for  a  forced   approach   where
departments have no options except as to when they would like  to  join  and
partake in Sita. It also  dermacates  the  Government's  IT  domain  as  the
monopolistic playing field of Sita with no  alternatives  for  participating
departments. In the amending Bill we changed that approach somewhat.  So  in
areas  such  as  transversal  systems,  systems  that  are   common   across
Government, we want to ensure that all departments must participate, and  we
are unapologetic about that.

With regard to specific systems and  applications,  that  support  the  core
activities of departments  where  necessary,  should  enter  into  strategic
partnerships with the industry so that we could  meet  the  requirements  of
Government and the broader citizenry of South Africa. But we also want  Sita
to be able to do more. In the  Amendment  Bill,  it  has  been  mandated  to
become  the  central  procurement  agency  for  IT  goods  and  services  in
Government. This has been agreed on  within  Government  and  with  National
Treasury. This applies irrespective of whether these services or  goods  are
mandatory transversal or optional  departmental  specific  applications  and
systems. During  the  acquisition  and  procurement  process,  Sita  has  to
certify systems in terms of interoperability, ie whether they  can  talk  to
one another.

Secondly, they need to evaluate and certify the services and goods in  terms
of compliance to the accepted security standards  applicable  to  Government
Information Systems, and they also need to  identify  possible  duplications
and combine requirements for procurement through the  co-ordination  of  the
procurement and acquisition  needs  of  Government  departments.  This  will
enable Sita to negotiate maximum discounts and, mind you, they do  not  need
to declare them. It is only us who  need  to  declare  them,  but  they  can
negotiate maximum discounts and  achieve  economies  of  scale  through  the
leverage of the buying muscle of Government.

The amending Bill will also allow Sita to  restructure  and  streamline  its
organisation and processes to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  next  decades
without neglecting those founding departments - the  founding  members  that
set up Sita. Today, as we seek to broaden the base of economic activity,  we
also acknowledge that Government has a critical role in the development  and
expansion of the capacity of emerging and  existing  black  IT  enterprises.
This Bill will provide the way to allow this to happen; to allow  the  clear
impact that Sita has on the broader economy to actually impact  on  emerging
businesses to participate in the lucrative Government IT market, as well  as
providing  opportunities  for  such  companies  in  all  our  provinces   to
participate in the provision of services.

This House  is  concerned  with  the  provinces  and  their  interests.  The
amendments will bring direct benefits to the provinces in terms of  ensuring
that they receive  the  benefit  of  Government  IT  services.  The  savings
through the buying power of Sita and the IT Acquisition Centre  will  ensure
both economies of scale and that the best deals being negotiated  on  behalf
of one department, whether provincial or  national,  will  accrue  to  other
departments requiring the same goods  and  services.  We  will  be  able  to
ensure that Government and its departments do not become the dumping  ground
for obsolete technology that has been rejected  by  another  department  who
saw it as obsolete, or even  the  dumping  ground  of  IT  companies  -  big
companies who think that this is the place where they  can  try  to  make  a
fast buck.

This amending Bill also requires that regulations are put in place  so  that
when purchases  are  made,  consideration  is  given  to  suppliers  in  the
provinces where the services are required. So,  it  is  not  going  to  take
business away from the provinces. It is going to ensure that it does  happen
there. We should also state that Sita  operates  in  a  dynamic  environment
where technology matures and becomes obsolete in no time,  in  a  matter  of
three to five years. To run such a company that deals with  a  fast-changing
environment, we need the board to be strengthened and expanded.

Through this expansion and strengthening, we feel that certain  skills  need
to be accommodated as we appoint  nonexecutive  directors.  We  will  ensure
that we bring, through the expanded numbers, skills that may well  currently
be missing and that we need on the board. Furthermore, to ensure  that  Sita
remains  competitive,  the  Act  is  being  amended   to   ensure   adequate
consultation on the cost of services on the one  hand,  and  on  the  other,
allowing departments a  choice  in  terms  of  successfully  contracting  at
reasonable  market  rates.  Like  any  provider  of  goods   and   services,
Government must continually seek  ways  to  add  value  to  the  product  it
provides. Sita as an agency provides that product to Government,  a  product
that enhances many services and products  that  each  Government  department
provides to its clients base - the people of South Africa.

We hence want to place before  this  House  today  a  Bill  that  seeks  to;
enhance and improve, and to build on the lessons that we  have  learnt   one
that increases efficiency and effectiveness, and ensures  the  rendering  of
state-of-the-art services. The adoption of this  Bill  by  Parliament  as  a
whole will herald the beginning of a new era that allows Sita  to  become  a
true partner in improving  Government  operations  through  enabling  world-
class information technology systems. I would like hon members  to  bear  in
mind that it will also be allowing us to build that in  South  Africa  as  a
country.

It  is  fitting  that  we  deal  with  this  amending  Bill  in  this  House
immediately after we have  hosted  the  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development
because the use of  IT  services  by  Government  is  a  core  component  in
providing integrated and efficient services.  It  is  also  a  service  that
tries to eliminate waste and duplication; a service that  ensures  that  the
different spheres of  Government,  different  departments  and  institutions
know what is happening and are able to share that information and  knowledge
that they have. It is also to ensure that services reach everyone, those  in
the most, remote parts of  our  country  as  well  as  those  in  the  urban
centres, because through Sita and the services it should facilitate, we  are
going to ensure that we use ICT to close the  digital  divide  and  to  take
forward sustainability in development. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  in  discussing
a short but intensely technical Bill like this, one can foresee a  situation
in which we may end up repeating ourselves.  Therefore  I  am  resorting  to
plan B. [Interjections.] The amendment of the State  Information  Technology
Agency Act of  1998  was  necessitated  by  a  number  of  factors.  I  will
highlight  a  few  of  these.  Firstly,  there   were   the   findings   and
recommendations of the Presidential Review  Commission  of  1999.  Secondly,
there was the realisation that Sita could not and should not be expected  to
do everything in Government's IT business and  remain  effective,  efficient
and competitive. Thirdly, there was a need to allow Sita  formally,  by  way
of legislation, to focus on the entire business of Government's  information
technology central acquisition as a formal business with subsidiaries.

In order to enable Sita to stay focused and competitive and  to  retain  its
primary mandate in all respects, a guiding philosophy was developed.

It is this philosophy that will guide Sita in  deciding  on  the  compulsory
and/or optional IT services that it  will  render  to  public  institutions.
This philosophy is elaborated on in detail in the drastic transformation  of
the Sita Act of 1998, as stipulated in clause 5 of this Bill.  This  is  the
very clause that  has  sparked  off  an  intense  debate  in  the  committee
deliberations, resulting in extended sessions, but thanks to the  commitment
of the officials of the  department  -  I  see  only  one  of  them  here  -
especially the directors of  Sita,  and  the  dedication  of  the  committee
members and the Chief Whip, we were able to deal  with  those  issues  which
initially seemed contentious.

Regarding the operation of a private telecommunications network by Sita,  we
are satisfied that this action will not adversely affect the terrain of  the
present service providers since there is legislation in place  to  safeguard
their interests.

Despite this assurance, the situation would have been been  clearer  if  the
independent regulator had given that assurance, especially  when  one  bears
in mind that an eminent second operator is about to come on  board.  We,  as
provincial delegates will be looking forward with keen  interest  to  seeing
how Sita executes  its  broadened  business,  how  it  reaches  out  to  the
provinces and especially how it serves local  government,  which  by  Sita's
own admission, is a glaring omission at this stage.

We are however, very optimistic that our municipalities  will  not  be  left
out since our hon Minister is on record as being a  proponent,  if  not  the
initiator, of a process of seamless government.

Having considered the present business of Sita and  the  necessity  of  this
amendment before us, I have no doubt that the Bill is desirable  to  further
enhance service delivery to the broader public. [Applause.]

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, may I, even in the  absence  of  the  department,
thank them for a particularly good briefing when they presented the Bill  to
the committee. The DA concurs fully with the objects of the Bill,  which  is
the improvement of service delivery to the public through the  provision  of
information technology and information services to  departments  and  organs
of state.

Even  though  the  centralisation  we  see  in  the  amendments  are   still
problematic,  these  can  be  justified,  particularly  on  the  grounds  of
economies of scale. There is also a refreshing recognition of  the  need  to
create partnerships with existing service providers instead  of  reinventing
the wheel in every instance.

Much of modern day business and administration is dependent  on  the  speedy
spread of information on a national and international basis. Very  important
for the success of such systems is the seamless interface of  technology  or
as we say, the ability of computers to talk  to  one  another.  The  justice
system is a case in point. By having access to the  Internet,  for  example,
prosecutors will not only be able to network  with  one  another,  but  also
keep up to date with the latest judgements. With access to  basic  equipment
such as computers, the opportunities for departments such as the  police  to
be fully connected countrywide has obvious advantages.

When one takes into account, however, that the  walkie-talkie  system  which
the police use for communication is constantly  not  in  operation,  because
there are no funds for repairs, it becomes quite clear that  the  supply  of
an information network  is  only  the  beginning  of  a  process.  The  most
important part will be to see to it that it actually works. This means  that
Sita will only be effective if it is  properly  staffed,  trained,  serviced
and monitored. The whole purpose of combining the state information  service
in a compatible network will also fail if the provision and  maintenance  of
transversal information systems are not followed through.

In the press this morning I saw that the SA Speakers' Forum signed  a  R16,6
million contract with the AST consortium to supply Parliament and  the  nine
provincial legislatures with computers and software. It was  signed  by  the
National Assembly Speaker, Dr Frene  Ginwala  and  AST  executive  director,
John Ramatsui. One's immediate reaction is to ask  whether  these  computers
and software will be compatible with the systems which  will  be  prescribed
by Sita.

One also wonders how costly it is going to  be  to  marry  all  the  diverse
existing systems which are already in operation, some  of  which  came  into
being only very recently, such as the system used by the Free  State  health
department and the health information system in Limpopo.

Under the duties and powers of the agency, clause 7(3) states  that  despite
any  other  law  to  the  contrary,  every  department  must   procure   all
information technology goods or services through the agency. This should  be
of  great  concern  to  the  provinces,  despite  the  reassurances  of  the
Minister, because of  the  increased  opportunity  created  for  procurement
centralisation. Although we  were  told  by  the  department  that  the  the
infotech acquisition centre is not a tender board, but  will  only  set  the
standards for a procurement centrally, we could easily fall  into  the  trap
of directing acquisitions through agencies in big cities  to  the  detriment
of smaller towns and economies.
It is important that the economies of scale be weighed against the need  for
regional development. The agency is required to focus on generating  maximum
efficiency and cost-effectiveness for the state, and  the  Sita  board  must
recommend to the Minister, on the basis of a  strategic  plan,  what  excess
funds will be retained by the agency and for which purpose.

I have my doubts, however, as to the level of business efficiency that  such
an agency can attain. Although I was told in committee  that  no  particular
third party has as yet been identified, we will also look with  interest  at
the provision created for subsidaries and the transfer of shares.

While we have some concerns about the practical implementation of  the  Bill
and Sita's capacity to meet their objectives, the DA supports  the  amending
Bill.

Mnr J HORNE: Agb Voorsitter, agb Minister en lede van die Huis, dit  is  vir
my aangenaam om deel te neem aan hierdie debat, daar hierdie  wetgewing  die
Staatsdiens moet orden om sodoende ekonomiesgerig te opereer.  Die  hoofdoel
van   hierdie    wysigingswetsontwerp    is    om    die    Wet    op    die
Staatsinligtingstegnologie-agentskap van 1998, algemeen bekend as die  Sita-
wet, te wysig om veranderings aan  te  bring  weens  'n  kabinetsbesluit  in
April 2001; Sita te magtig om sekere funksies uit te voer, gebaseer  op  die
bevindings van die Presidensiële Hersieningskommissie; en om  die  verpligte
dienste wat Sita aan nasionale en provinsiale  departemente  moet  lewer  te
herdefinieer. Sita het in April 1999 met sy  dienste  begin.  Die  voormelde
kabinetsbesluit het 'n nuwe besigheidsmodel  vir  Sita  goedgekeur.  Hierdie
nuwe model sluit in die totstandkoming  van  die  Regering  se  "Information
Technology House of Value"  wat  onder  andere  fokus  op  die  fundamentele
beginsels van veiligheid van inligtingstegnologie, IT soos dit  algemeen  na
verwys word.

Om   hierdie    nuwe    besigheidsmodel    te    implementeer    maak    die
wysigingswetsontwerp voorsiening vir die instel van  filiale  sowel  as  vir
die oordrag  van  aandele  in  enige  filiaal  van  Sita  aan  derde  partye
onderhewig   aan   kabinetsgoedkeuring.   Die   doel   van   hierdie    nuwe
besigheidsmodel,  ``IT  House  of  Value'',  is   om   koste   te   verlaag,
produktiwiteit te verhoog  en  dienslewering  te  verhoog.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and  members  of  the  House,  it
gives me pleasure to participate in this debate, in  that  this  legislation
should organise the Public Service so  as  to  operate  in  an  economically
directed way. The main objective of this amending Bill is to amend  the  law
on the State Information Technology Agency Act of 1998,  commonly  known  as
the Sita law, in order to bring  about  changes  resulting  from  a  Cabinet
decision taken  in  April  2001;  to  empower  Sita  to  carry  out  certain
functions based on the findings of the Presidential Review  Commission,  and
to redefine the compulsory services that Sita must provide to  national  and
provincial departments. Sita commenced  its  services  in  April  1999.  The
above-mentioned Cabinet decision approved a new  business  model  for  Sita.
This new model includes the establishment of  the  Government's  Information
Technology House of Value that,  inter  alia,  focuses  on  the  fundamental
principles of safety of information technology, or  IT  as  it  is  commonly
referred to.

To implement this new business model the amending Bill makes  provision  for
the establishment of branches as well as for the transfer of shares  in  any
branch of Sita to third parties subject to  Cabinet  approval.  The  aim  of
this new business model, IT House  of  Value,  is  to  lower  costs  and  to
increase productivity and service delivery.]

Government's information technology and communication strategies  have  been
endorsed by an international advisory council of experts which will  in  the
future concentrate on ways to translate  them  into  concrete  projects  and
programmes. The Presidential International Advisory Council  on  Information
Society and Development assembled by President Mbeki last year, met in  June
2002  to  discuss  economic  growth  and   competitiveness,   research   and
development and the implementation of an e-government programme.
Many  prominent  international  delegates  and  experts  in  the  field   of
information technology attended this  discussion.  Three  focus  areas  were
identified,  namely  health  and  telemedicine;  small,  medium  and   micro
enterprise growth and development, and lastly education.

Die Nuwe NP sou graag wou sien dat klousule 15, artikel 23  moet  lees  ``in
consultation with all executing authorities'' en nie ``after  consultation''
nie. Nogtans glo die Nuwe NP dat die wysigings wat  in  hierdie  wetsontwerp
voorkom, onder andere die hand van Sita sal  sterk  om  inligtingstegnologie
en -stelsels te voorsien wat daarop gemik is  om  die  inligtingstegnologie-
tekortkominge binne regeringsdepartemente positief te hanteer,  en  derhalwe
steun die Nuwe NP hierdie wetgewing.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[The New NP would like to see  that  clause  15,  paragraph  23  reads  ``in
consultation   with   all   executing   authorities''   and   not    ``after
consultation''. The New NP nevertheless believes that  the  amendments  that
appear in this Bill will,  inter  alia,  strengthen  the  hand  of  Sita  in
supplying  information  technology  and  systems  aimed  at   handling   the
information technology shortages in government  departments  in  a  positive
manner, and therefore the New NP supports this legislation.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Madam Chair, the hon  Minister,  colleagues  and  comrades,
the State Information Technology  Agency  was  incorporated  in  1999  as  a
private company to provide information technology-related services  for  the
Public Service.  This  was  a  very  important  step,  because  through  its
creation we have been able to significantly  modernise  the  Public  Service
and enhance the level of service  delivery  with  which  the  ANC  has  been
mandated.

Information technology is not an end in itself, but is an  instrument  which
can assist government processes  aimed  at  speeding  up  transformation  to
redress past imbalances. As  a  newly  established  democracy  in  an  ever-
changing global context we are facing new  responsibilities  driven  by  the
technology push. One of these is the need to think beyond  the  traditional,
highly structured applications of technology. We need to  address  the  real
world of human interactions. We need to update our awareness of how the  new
technologies may be exploited to ensure the integration of  all  sectors  of
society into the mainstream of our endeavours.

In this regard we are in a special position to use the latest  technological
advances to make an impact on the quality of life of those persons  who  are
most in need of this, such as the disabled and the  rural  poor.  Technology
in this regard is a double-edged  sword.  It  can  serve  to  alienate  such
persons, as more and more of our  jobs  and  interactions  become  keyboard-
based. At the same time it can be the door-opener to  a  better  quality  of
life for them. Affordable access to information technology, particularly  in
remote and rural areas of the country, is essential to  help  us  to  create
opportunities for growth and  jobs  and  to  bring  new  services  to  rural
communities. It provides the rural masses with an outlet for their  products
and a means  to  improve  their  awareness  of  national  and  international
developments, as well as a powerful medium for  exchanging  information  and
ideas. To ensure affordable access to information technology for  our  rural
people, it is essential that Government, at all three  levels,  must  become
model users of  information  technology  and  act  as  a  catalyst  for  the
development of information technology.

The three spheres of Government must promote, within their respective  areas
of  responsibility,  continuing  co-operation  in  the  use  of  information
technology to improve the delivery of services to  the  public  in  general,
and marginalised groups in  particular.  They  must  support,  within  their
respective  areas  of   responsibility,   and   consistent   with   national
Government's priorities, an intergovernmental  approach  to  programmes  and
initiatives  to  improve  access  to  information  technology.   The   State
Information Technology  Agency  is  the  ideal  vehicle  to  ensure  such  a
collaborative approach.

The main objective of Sita is to serve  as  the  institution  that  will  be
responsible  for  the  provision  of  information  technology,   information
systems and related services to and  on  behalf  of  government  departments
across all spheres of Government. To carry this out effectively,  Sita  will
need a supportive framework that  will  enable  it  to  carry  out  its  key
functions. The current Act has been passed in 1998 and since then  a  number
of new developments have taken place which impact on  the  effectiveness  of
its operation.

One of the most important new changes  that  have  been  introduced  is  the
cabinet  decision  to  approve  a  new  business  model  for   Sita,   which
fundamentally alters the way in which Sita must conduct  its  business.  The
focus of the new model is to eliminate duplication with the aim of  lowering
costs, increasing productivity and enhancing service delivery. The  amending
Bill accordingly proposes material amendments which substantially impact  on
the  functioning  of  Sita  and  the  provision  of  information  technology
services to national and provincial government  departments.  Without  these
amendments, Sita's ability and performance in respect  of  service  delivery
will be severely hampered.

Lastly, the amending Bill also proposes a number  of  technical  changes  to
substitute outdated terms and omit superfluous references  in  the  original
Act. The ANC is convinced of the need to introduce changes to  the  original
Act. We also believe that the amendments will serve the  purpose  for  which
they have been proposed. We therefore support this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Chairperson,  I
would like to thank the members for  their  inputs  during  this  debate.  I
should actually start out by thanking the select committee  under  the  able
chairpersonship of the hon Mkhaliphi, according to the notice here, who  has
been chairing, and marshalling this particular Bill  through  the  committee
in the NCOP. I also think one should thank the officials who  have  done  an
able job of working with members of the select committee on this Bill.  This
involves officials within DPSA and officials from Sita.
I am going to take up a few issues that have been raised here  and  I  would
want to say a word of caution as well. What we have seen with this  Bill  is
what happens when there are  powerful  stakeholders  who  lose  out  in  the
National Assembly and then lobby the NCOP. That has been the case with  this
particular Bill.

There was  an  independent  authority  who  approached  members  and  raised
concerns  around  the  possibility  of  confusion  of  mandates,  but  those
concerns have been dealt with in the  National  Assembly  and  also  at  the
level of the Executive.

I think we should follow processes quite closely as  we  engage  on  issues,
otherwise we open ourselves up to being  lobbied  to  raise  issues  at  the
level of the NCOP. I am not suggesting that it is  incorrect,  but  we  must
just look at the role of influential stakeholders, because the role of  Sita
is by no means to get involved in areas that broadly relate to ICT in  South
Africa. It is restricted to the Public Service and we will clearly  look  at
the mandate in terms of local government.
In terms of local government, I am rather surprised that it is  stated  that
members of Sita and officials have said that they have overlooked  the  role
of local government, because we were  quite  conscious  of  that  particular
role. One can look at the Government Information Technology Officers  forum,
the GITO Council, for instance, where all the CEOs  come  together.  At  the
level of that forum there is also an interface  with  local  government.  If
one looks at the policy processes that we have been involved in  in  looking
at regulatory frameworks and  policies,  it  should  be  clear  to  the  ICT
environment that local government is there.

If it is about the capacity to roll out and  to  service  local  government,
that is where we need to look at the phasing in of it. Indeed, if one  looks
at the Information Technology Acquisitions Centre - Itac itself -  One  will
see that Itac will not immediately  deal  with  the  whole  issue  of  local
government procurement,  but  it  needs  to  start  out  with  national  and
provincial government. So, I just wanted to bring this to the fore  and  say
that we need to look at these questions from that particular point of view.

I then want to go further: I think  some  members  have  spoken  -  the  hon
Lubidla raised it as well as the member who spoke prior to her, Mr  Horne  -
about the ICT Advisory Council and the use and role of ICT  in  the  country
as a whole in terms of the accessibility of the Public Service  in  unserved
and underserved areas.

Being part of the support team to the President, we have been  involved  for
the past two years in the meetings of the ICT Advisory Council. Last year  I
made a presentation on e-government and a follow-up presentation this  year.
Just to indicate to this august House today, the experts told the  President
that, when looking at the e-government plan, they had  nothing  to  add  and
that he, clearly, had defined what the needs were for e-government  in  this
country, and  that  what  we  could  focus  on  was  narrowing  it  down  to
particular areas that should be prioritised, but that did not mean that  the
other work should stop.
Now, Prof Manuel Castells, a world-renowned sociologist,  is  part  of  this
Council and he was present last year. He said - and has done so  in  various
lectures - that the availability and use of  information  and  communication
technology is a prerequisite for economic  and  social  development  in  our
world. It is the functional equivalent  of  electricity  in  the  industrial
era. Last year, he went as far as very simply saying many  people  will  say
that if there is poverty one cannot eat IT. However, if one  does  not  have
IT then one cannot eat, because the use of IT and ICT is  also  to  look  at
the possibilities of opening markets.

We want to make that a reality in the Public  Service,  besides  looking  at
the focus areas, through using  IT  to  roll  out  services  in  underserved
areas. We do not want IT to dictate solutions to Government. But we want  to
say, as Government, that  we  would  like  to  use  IT  to  make  Government
services more accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a  week,  every  day  of
the year. We do not want our pensioners to go to  welfare  offices  only  on
those days when payouts are made. We would like to ensure  accessibility  of
grants in order that they can go on any day of the month  to  draw  on  that
money and not just on that day when it has just been  deposited  into  their
accounts.

What is more, it is also about ensuring that they  can  access  services  in
any one of the 11 official languages. One  of  the  institutions  that  will
play  this  role  through  the  Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science   and
Technology is the CSIR, which will ensure the  availability  of  service  in
the 11 official languages. And they have just made a breakthrough by  making
isiZulu accessible, as a first stage, through the use of ICT.

Having said that, it means that we need to use the  agencies  that  we  have
set up for proficiency and efficiency purposes. We must use them  well.  But
they must be structured well. Some will  claim  overcentralisation,  but  if
one does not centralise how does one access economies of scale? If one  does
not centralise, how does one bind the kind  of  skills  that  one  has?  Our
centralisation is not to remove power, but  to  actually  empower.  I  think
this is how we  should  see  it.  There  has  never  been  an  intention  to
disempower provinces. On the contrary, the intention is, will  be,  and  has
been, when we were thinking of this Bill, of  how  do  we  ensure  that  the
provinces can also utilise this agency in a manner in which we  can  utilise
the economies of scale that will come about with the use of the  information
and technology agency.

So, I would like to conclude by saying that the inputs that have  been  made
today are very much appreciated, because if we do not get  this  input  then
we also do not take into account the diverse views that are there.  We  just
need to ensure that we do not at the same time also  get  lobbies  who  have
lost debates thinking they are going to achieve their goals in another  way.
In any case, that will not happen, because we consult very  well.  There  is
always good communication and we overcome those hurdles.  I  would  like  to
thank this House for the support of this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                          PERMISSIBILITY OF MOTION

                                  (Ruling)

Hon members, earlier during the sitting, the hon Ms  Botha  moved  a  motion
without notice regarding the sentencing to death-by-stoning of the  lady  in
Nigeria who had been found guilty of adultery. The hon  Mr  Lucas  raised  a
point of order, saying that the House had already adopted a similar  motion.


We have now checked the minutes of past plenaries and can confirm that,  for
the DA, Mr Matthee had previously moved a  motion  on  the  matter  and  the
motion was adopted by the House. [Interjections.] Ms Mahlangu!

In terms of NCOP Rule 75(2)(a) a motion may not be moved whose substance  is
the same as a motion which had  been  approved  or  rejected  by  the  House
during the preceding six months.  Given  that,  the  motion  that  Ms  Botha
raised has transgressed this Rule. Therefore it cannot be put to the  House.
[Interjections.]

The Council adjourned at 17:15.
