                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Hon  members  will
agree with me that we have  spent  quite  some  time  on  questions.  May  I
therefore appeal to hon members to consider, where possible,  waiving  their
right to move motions? I am not going to stop them -  those  who  feel  that
their motions cannot be held over will be given an opportunity -  but  I  am
urging hon members to move motions only if they are extremely important.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the Council -


  (1) calls upon the  Government  of  South  Africa  to  focus  upon  South
       Africa's priorities and its national interests,  as  this  should  be
       reflected  in  South  Africa's  foreign  policy   and   international
       relationships;


  (2) recognises that it is not feasible  on  the  one  hand  to  seek  the
       support of the free democratic and  developed  industrial  world  for
       South African and African initiatives, whilst on the other hand often
       aligning South Africa  with  undemocratic  states  whose  values  and
       actions are hostile to those very free states, ie Cuba,  Iran,  Iraq,
       Libya and Zimbabwe;


  (3) notes that it strikes at the heart of South Africa's credibility when
       we pay lip service to the values of free men and  yet  support  those
       that would violate  those  very  values  as  we  have  just  seen  in
       Zimbabwe;


  (4) calls upon the Government to urgently reorder our foreign  policy  by
       bringing our actions into sympathy with our own constitutional values
       and those of countries that can have real  meaning  to  our  welfare,
       progress and economic  expansion  and  that  can  add  value  to  our
       society; and


  (5) notes that South Africa has  substantially  slipped  from  the  hard-
       earned moral high ground it claimed for itself.

                CONGRATULATIONS TO SOUTH AFRICAN CRICKET TEAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that, notwithstanding the  fact  that  the  recently  concluded
       second leg of the  cricket  test  series  between  South  Africa  and
       Australia resulted in a  drubbing  of  the  Proteas  5-1,  the  South
       African national team did manage to  retrieve  an  ample  measure  of
       national pride by vanquishing the world's greatest  cricket  side  in
       the final test match at Kingsmead with an  inspirational  display  of
       guts, determination and passion - qualities that  seemingly  deserted
       the team in the previous five encounters; and


  (2) congratulates the stand-in captain, Mark Boucher,  and  his  team  on
       their convincing victory and wishes them well in  the  exciting  one-
       dayers commencing on Friday at Newlands.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   TRIBUTE TO DR CHRISTA ROODT OF PANSALB
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy dank en  waardering  uitspreek  vir  die  baanbrekerswerk  wat  dr
       Christa Roodt van die Pan-Suid-Afrikaanse  Taalraad  gedoen  het  ten
       opsigte van die beperking van taalregteskendings en  die  bevordering
       van veeltaligheid;


  (2) erkenning geen aan -


       (a)  die ewewigtigheid en ywer wat sy in mediasie geopenbaar het; en


       (b)  die passie waarmee sy veeltaligheid as  'n  werklikheid  in  die
           praktyk bevorder het; en


  (3) haar 'n suksesvolle akademiese loopbaan toewens met die wete dat  die
       vlam van omgee vir taal en kultuur oor al die grense heen nie  geblus
       sal  word  nie  en  steeds   in   diens   van   al   die   taal-   en
       kultuurgemeenskappe  in  Suid-Afrika  sal   wees.   Dankie   met   'n
       hoofletter!

Ons wens haar opvolgers sterkte en voorspoed toe. (Translation of  Afrikaans
motion without notice follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its gratitude and appreciation for the pioneering work done
       by Dr Christa Roodt of the  Pan-South  African  Language  Board  with
       regard to limiting violation of language rights and the promotion  of
       multilingualism;


  (2) recognises -
       (a)  the balanced manner and dedication she displayed  in  mediation;
           and


       (b)  the passion with which she promoted multilingualism as a reality
           in practice;


  (3) wishes her a successful academic career in  the  knowledge  that  the
       flame of caring for language and culture across all  boundaries  will
       not be extinguished and that it will still be in the service  of  all
       the linguistic and cultural communities in South  Africa.  Thank  you
       with a capital letter!

We wish her successors good luck and prosperity.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          DIVISION OF REVENUE BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon  members,  the  Division
of Revenue Bill is one of the most important  Bills  that  this  House  must
deal with every year. Firstly, it is a Bill required by section 214  of  the
Constitution, and section 76(4)(b) of the Constitution  requires  it  to  be
dealt with as a section 76(1) Bill.

This Bill is at the heart of the budgets of all nine provinces and  the  284
municipalities, so it is right and proper for this House  to  consider  this
Bill very carefully. In this regard, we must note and acknowledge  the  role
of and the  process  undertaken  by  the  Select  Committee  on  Finance  in
processing this legislation.

There is also a second reason why this Bill is  important  for  this  House.
Section 42(4) of our Constitution charges the National Council of  Provinces
with representing the provinces to  ensure  that  provincial  interests  are
taken into account in the national sphere of government by participating  in
the national legislative process and  by  providing  a  national  forum  for
public consideration of issues affecting the provinces.

In providing this forum, this House enables the public to link this Bill  to
the core issues of how we  fund  our  basic  and  social  services,  how  we
address poverty alleviation, etc. This is a discussion  not  only  for  this
House, but for every one of the nine provincial  legislatures  and  the  284
municipal councils.

This process is also the embodiment of co-operative governance, which is  at
the heart of our Constitution. It must be measured not only  by  allocations
to each sphere, but also by how decisions have been  reached.  Firstly,  the
budget process is, and must  be,  driven  by  policy  priorities.  Secondly,
given our three-year budgeting system, we build on the  allocations  already
made for 2002-2003 in last year's MTEF, which is our starting point for  the
2002 Budget.

Soon after the 2001 Budget, Government initiated consultations on  the  2002
Budget process by reviewing the medium-term priorities of all three  spheres
of government. These deliberations shaped decisions  on  the  allocation  of
resources for the 2002 Budget. The division of revenue set out in  the  Bill
gives expression to the Government's  policy  priorities.  It  reflects  the
recognition  by  Government  that  our  frontline   provincial   and   local
governments need to be strengthened in  the  fight  to  reduce  poverty  and
vulnerability within our communities. These are  the  governments  that  our
Constitution vests with implementing service  delivery  obligations  to  our
people.

In order to determine the division of revenue  between  the  three  spheres,
national Government has  taken  into  account  the  recommendations  of  the
Financial and  Fiscal  Commission  and  has  consulted  with  provinces  and
organised local government. The consultation  process  involved  the  Budget
Council, which includes all provincial MEC's  of  Finance,  and  the  Budget
Forum,  which  includes  Salga   and   its   provincial   local   government
associations. A joint Minmec with local government MECs and organised  local
government was also held, and premiers were invited to an  extended  Cabinet
meeting.

An interministerial  task  team  also  assessed  allocations  to  the  local
sphere.  The  2001  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  also  provided  solid
information on  budget  trends  in  the  provincial  and  local  spheres  of
government, and the pressures to be addressed when deciding on the  division
of revenue.

We have also taken on board the  recommendation  by  Parliament  to  publish
this Bill earlier by publishing a draft Bill in the Gazette  on  6  December
2001. In this regard, one would just like to say that 6 December is not  the
best of times to be publishing an important document such as this  one,  but
I also think that given the nature of the budget process, it is going to  be
important for Parliament to take  note  of  this  and  to  make  adjustments
accordingly, so that it can place  itself  in  a  position  to  meaningfully
contribute to shaping the Division of Revenue Bill.

Early publication of the draft Bill,  which  included  frameworks  for  each
grant and allocations by province,  provided  legislatures  and  the  public
with a near complete  picture  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  flows  and  an
opportunity to make their inputs before Budget Day.  It  also  ensured  more
certainty for provincial governments as they finalised  their  budgets,  and
to enable them to plan for the spending of all funds available to them.

The Division of Revenue Bill, 2002, gives effect to section  214(1)  of  the
Constitution and the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act of  1997.  These
require an annual Act of Parliament to provide for  the  equitable  division
of revenue raised nationally among the  three  spheres  of  government.  The
spirit and intent of this Bill is similar to the 2001  Division  of  Revenue
Act, with no significant changes to the functioning of the  fiscal  transfer
arrangements.

This Bill must be read with the  Budget  Review,  particularly  annexure  E,
which is also attached to the  Bill.  This  annexure  outlines  Government's
response to the proposals of the FFC, the assumptions we  use  and  formulae
that were applied in order to  arrive  at  the  final  division  of  revenue
between the three spheres. The attached appendices to the Bill provide  more
details on each grant.

I think, again, I do want to emphasise the point that  one  has  interaction
that takes place between the FFC and the national  Treasury,  and  one  also
has interaction of the FFC with Parliament at national  level,  as  well  as
with  provincial  legislatures.  I  think  that  one  of  the  things   that
challenges us is how to manage the interaction that takes place  across  the
board in that fashion, so that we can make the best of that interaction.

This Budget increases provincial transfers from R121 billion  this  year  to
R132 billion for 2002-03, rising to R152 billion in 2004-05. The  provincial
share grows at  7,9%  per  annum  over  the  next  three  years.  The  local
government share increases from R6,5 billion this year to  R8,5  billion  in
2002-03, and rises to R10,9  billion  in  2004-05.  The  local  share  rises
rapidly at 18,3% per annum.
Quite clearly, there is quite  a  strong  focus,  firstly,  to  support  the
transition of local government, and secondly to ensure that we  support  and
strengthen  local  government,  because  it  is  really  at  the  heart   of
Government delivery of basic services.

The Schedules to the Division of Revenue Bill provide  a  summary  of  these
transfers. Schedule 1 of the Bill allocates R288 billion  in  2002-03,  with
the provincial equitable share amounting to  R119  billion,  and  the  local
government equitable share amounting to R3,9 billion. After  deducting  debt
service costs and the contingency reserve, national Government is  allocated
R96 billion.

Schedules 3 to 6 allocate further conditional and other grants to  provinces
and local government. Provinces receive conditional grants amounting to  R13
billion  in  2002-2003,  increasing  the  total  amount  of  funds   to   be
transferred to provinces to R132 billion, as against the R119  billion  that
I spoke about  earlier  on,  and  that  is  55,8%  of  the  allocated  funds
available after debt servicing.  Local  government  receives  a  further  R5
billion in conditional grants, bringing its total share to  R9  billion,  or
3,6% of allocated expenditure.

This  year's  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  provides  R13  billion  more  for
additional spending. This represents a major boost to real  spending  across
all spheres. Over the next three years, both the provincial  and  the  local
share of national revenue rises faster than inflation, and I think  that  is
important because it means  that  we  are  indeed  significantly  increasing
expenditure in Government. These increases reflect  Government's  commitment
to the delivery of basic services to reduce poverty and vulnerability.

The increased allocation to provinces will result  in  greater  spending  on
increases to old age pensions, child support and other grants,  as  well  as
for provincial infrastructure. The  2001  Budget  provided  for  significant
increases  in  infrastructure  allocation  to  provinces.  The  2002  Budget
maintains this trend, with the allocation rising from R1,9 billion in  2002-
03 to R2,8 billion in 2004-05. As a  result,  provinces  will  receive  R7,3
billion from this grant over the three-year period,  an  increase  of  about
25% over the 2001 Budget.

It is anticipated that provinces will use this  grant  effectively  to  deal
with infrastructure  backlogs  in  schools,  health  facilities,  provincial
roads and so on. It is going to be important that we really ensure,  all  of
us, here at national level and in  the  provinces,  that  these  significant
increases  on  infrastructure  spending  are  indeed  utilised  effectively.
Indeed, when we talk infrastructure, the tendency is to think  more  of  the
grand schemes, the large projects, but I think the important issue  here  is
that this infrastructure spending must help to enhance the quality  of  life
of our people. So we talk about roads, we talk about health  facilities,  we
talk about schools.

Provinces will also deal with the pressures of HIV/Aids. The allocation  for
the HIV/Aids grant increases from R130 million in 2001-02  to  R346  million
in 2002-03, rising to R574  million  in  2004-05.  This  will  step  up  the
preventive programme initiated by Government in the 2000 Budget.

A three-year  allocation  of  R392  million  is  also  provided  to  improve
hospital management and the quality of health care.  The  programme  started
as  a  pilot  and  will  gradually  be  expanded  to  other  hospitals.  The
appointment of chief executive officers for hospitals and the delegation  of
management powers to these executive officers, should  herald  a  period  of
real improvement in the running of our major hospitals.

The changes to the hospital  tertiary  services  and  training  grants  will
extend funding for tertiary services to 27 hospitals from the current 10  in
all provinces. They will also support extending training of specialists  and
other health professionals to poor provinces, to  improve  the  distribution
of such professionals among provinces. I am sure members  will  recall  that
when we published the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review last year,  it  had  a
table which showed the distribution of  specialists  across  the  provinces.
What it clearly showed was that one of the greatest inequities that we  have
in South Africa is reflected in the shortage of medical specialists in  some
of the provinces.

Part of this money is therefore aimed at  taking  the  first  steps  towards
addressing that shortage of  specialists  in  some  of  the  provinces.  The
challenge facing our medical schools is to take  advantage  of  the  greater
funding for new specialist posts in poor  provinces.  All  provinces  should
increase their tertiary and training budgets in real terms over  the  medium
term.

The substantial increase in the local government  share  also  provides  for
all  municipalities  in  need  to  receive  their   equitable   share.   The
institutional grant is increased to enable  municipalities  with  relatively
weak capacity to receive funds to assist them with the cost  of  governance,
that is councillors  salaries  and  administration  costs.  The  S-component
grant will enable municipalities to extend basic services to the needy at  a
faster rate. These funds are additional to allocations to the Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry and the Department of  Minerals  and  Energy  for
the roll-out of water and electricity programmes. Municipalities  must  also
prioritise their own revenue towards  providing  in  these  priorities.  The
equitable share allocation  also  includes  a  further  allocation  of  R632
million over the next three years towards the 13 rural  and  8  urban  nodes
prioritised by Government. These are the  nodes  for  the  Integrated  Rural
Development Strategy and Urban Renewal Strategy.

We shall be introducing greater certainty for fiscal transfers to the  local
sphere to assist them with developing more credible  integrated  development
plans to guide their 2002-03 budgets. The Ministry for Provincial and  Local
Government will be completing its work on  the  powers  and  functions,  and
formulae,  enabling  the   national   Government   to   publish   three-year
allocations by municipality. We hope to do this shortly.

The information that accompanies this Bill goes beyond what is  required  by
both the Constitution and the other relevant  statutes.  The  objectives  of
the Bill are to enhance predictability, transparency and  accountability  in
all spheres of government. As I said in my introduction, the Bill  not  only
makes allocations to the provincial and local  spheres,  it  also  lays  the
basis for making these allocations per province and per  municipality.  More
importantly, it  further  deepens  co-operative  governance  in  the  budget
allocation process. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson,  hon  members  ...  [Interjections.]  What  is
wrong with you? [Interjections.]

Special delegates,  hon  members  of  this  esteemed  House,  it  is  always
difficult not to speak in these debates because  the  select  committee  has
only one female member - something which I think is  not  a  good  sign  for
this House - who happens to be the chair. If it were  not  for  that,  there
would not be any woman in this committee who will be participating, so I  am
more or less all the time compelled to participate in these  debates.  I  am
sometimes complimented by my colleagues from provinces, by name  of  Comrade
Sheila from the Northern Province and colleague Joan Fubbs from  Gauteng.  I
hope that the NCOP is noting this issue, as I have been raising it for  some
time.

It is once again a privilege for  me  to  present  and  lead  the  committee
discussion on the Division of Revenue Bill for 2002-03. The Bill before  the
council has been intensely interrogated by the committee, both by  permanent
members  representing  their  provinces  and  by  special   delegates   from
provinces, and also at the provincial level. The amendments that  have  been
effected to the Bill therefore reflect the  spirit  that  prevailed  in  the
committee.  The  committee  hosted  public  hearings,  and  seven   of   the
departments  which  are  receiving  conditional  grants  to  provinces   and
municipalities participated in the hearings.

The Bill before this house deals with  the  following  key  issues.  Amongst
other issues, the Bill deals  with  the  equitable  division  of  nationally
raised revenue among the three spheres of government,  which  are  national,
provincial  and  local  government.  Secondly,  it  also  deals   with   the
conditional grants to provinces and also  to  local  government,  which  are
funds intended to perform national functions  for  both  municipalities  and
provinces. Members will talk about those specifically later.

The Bill also deals with grants in kind. Those are grants which do not  have
any conditions. I just want to mention two of  them.  One  of  them  is  the
Public Works grant, which refers to  the  Community-based  Works  programme.
The purpose of this grant is to create assets and I think in  the  past  and
in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review it was indicated that some  of  these
programmes that are delivered through this grant  are  stand-alone  entities
and that no one is looking after them. They are not utilised, and  there  is
no maintenance for those kinds of  things.  In  the  hearing,  Salga  raised
these kinds of issues very sharply. I think I  will  deal  with  them  at  a
later stage.
The second grant in kind is in relation to the  financial  management  grant
to  municipalities.  As  hon  members   know,   municipalities   have   been
restructured to be in line with the new demarcations. Therefore  this  grant
aims to help them to be in line with the Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework
budgeting and all those kinds of things.

The Bill also deals with the allocation to rural nodal points,  there  being
13 of them, and  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  the  Integrated  Rural
Development Strategy. I think  this  allocation  comes  from  the  equitable
share. This is an indication  that  Government  not  only  talks,  but  also
provides the funds that it has agreed  broadly.  The  Bill  deals  with  the
allocation of funds from the equitable share,  again,  to  the  eight  nodal
points.

The Division of Revenue  Bill  that  is  before  the  House  and  all  other
Division of Revenue Bills that we have  dealt  with  in  the  past,  is  the
Government's core means of  achieving  socioeconomic  rights.  As  March  is
Human Rights month I want to talk about these socioeconomic  rights  in  the
way I understand them.

One of the things that the Division of Revenue  Bill  does  is  to  allocate
money in order to provide housing to people, and that is one of  the  rights
enshrined in our Constitution: that people have the  right  to  shelter.  In
terms of some of the  judgments  given  by  the  Constitutional  Court,  for
instance in Grootboom and others,  I  want  Government  to  make  sure  that
people are given the right to shelter. So, in my view, allocation  of  funds
to this department and to the sector are a realisation of the  socioeconomic
right, which is fundamental to  people.  Obviously,  in  previous  apartheid
years, this right did not exist for black people.

The second right concerns the provision of education - that every  child  in
South Africa has a right to education. The budget allocated to provinces  in
this regard, I think, goes towards meeting this right and making  sure  that
even children who do not have any  means  of  paying  school  fees  are  not
denied the right to education.
The third right is to a clean and safe environment. All these  rights  I  am
talking about are enshrined in our Constitution: Chapter 2, under  the  Bill
of Rights. The Constitution provides for  them  in  terms  of  some  of  the
grants and amounts from the equitable share that are contained in the Bill.

The fourth right is the right to health, in  that  people  should  be  given
access to public hospitals, medicines and so forth. The Division of  Revenue
Bill clearly makes allocations to resources, whether at the municipal  level
or at the provincial  level,  and  whether  through  conditional  grants  or
through the equitable share.  The  Government  is  making  sure  that  these
rights are realised by poor people who are vulnerable and who  do  not  have
the means to access these kinds of services.

The other right is the right to clean and safe water, this week being  Water
Week. I think that amongst the grants that are in the  Division  of  Revenue
Bill, including conditional grants, there are grants from the Department  of
Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,  which  department  we  happened  to  have  a
discussion with.

In my view, the Division of Revenue Bill is not just a by-the-way  piece  of
legislation,  but  it  is  legislation  which  is  at  the   core   of   our
Constitution, which has at its  core  the  objective  of  making  sure  that
Government does indeed live up to  the  requirements  of  the  Constitution,
which are, in this regard, the socioeconomic rights in the form of the  Bill
of Rights and so forth.  We  interpret  this  to  include  all  these  other
things.

I just want to emphasise a few key points - issues which were of concern  to
the committee. Earlier on I talked about the maintenance costs. Some  assets
that  have  been  created  by  national  departments,  in   particular   the
maintenance costs, are not built in when the planning is done.  At  a  later
stage  these  buildings  are  left  alone  and  no  one  looks  after  them.
Municipalities do not have the money to look after these buildings. I  think
this is something that the national Treasury should take up with  the  other
departments concerned. I do not know who else, but other committees  in  the
NCOP should try to make sure that their respective line departments  do  not
continue to create these white elephants, because I do not think  it  is  in
the interests of our society to do so.

The report of the committee, which is in  the  ATC  today,  has  recommended
that Parliament's programme be adjusted - the  Deputy  Minister  has  talked
about that - to provide for the anticipated early tabling  of  the  Division
of Revenue Bill. We will leave this recommendation  to  our  principals,  to
the Whippery and to the programming committee. This  was  just  to  indicate
that the Bill was referred to us about two weeks ago, and the committee  has
had to finish this process in these two weeks. It  is  not  because  of  our
design as a committee, but because we  are  directed  by  the  programme  of
Parliament.

But, over and above that, when the Bill is  published  in  the  Gazette,  in
December -  it  should  rather  be  in  November.  All  of  us  are  in  our
constituencies at that particular time according to  Parliament's  programme
and we cannot do anything then. So we hope that when these discussions  take
place, all these factors will be taken into consideration.

Also, in line with Parliament wanting to be involved in the budget  process,
it is quite important and relevant that Parliament look  into  these  issues
in a broader sense without necessarily looking at whether people  should  be
in their constituencies, with their families and children.

The third point is  that  there  must  be  a  clear  framework  guiding  the
division of functions between the  B  and  the  C  municipalities  at  local
government level. In the committee's view, this process has taken  too  long
and we been have very concerned, and at this point the IDPs are going to  be
finalised or are at the point of being finalised.

Municipalities, in particular category C  municipalities  do  not  know  how
much they are going to  get,  and  also,  because  municipalities  are  just
starting to restructure, they do not know in terms  of  the  MTEF  how  much
they are going to get. We think this is quite an urgent matter and both  the
PLD and the national Treasury, to some extent, must make sure that in  these
processes in the future people are given the certainty in order for them  to
plan in the longer term.

I also want to indicate that the committee welcomes the  rationalisation  of
conditional grants, but  believes  there  is  still  room  for  improvement,
because in some of  the  grants,  in  particular  the  HIV/Aids  grant,  the
transport grant and the housing grant, some of  the  money  still  continues
not to be spent for reasons that, in our view are  not  necessarily  reasons
that would prevent the grants from being spent,  because  there  are  people
who need the money. However, the money continues not being  spent.  It  does
not reflect well on Government if these grants  are  not  forwarded  to  the
people who need them. Something else which was indicated  in  the  committee
is that some of these moneys are only sent to provinces or local  government
about three months before the financial year ends.  We  do  not  think  that
contributes towards good planning and financial management.
It is also important to point  out  that  the  early  childhood  development
grant will cease to be a  grant  and  will  form  part  and  parcel  of  the
equitable share. This will not only contribute towards  easing  the  system,
but, I think, is in line with one of the RDP objectives in  that  the  early
childhood  development  grant  should  be  part  and  parcel  of  mainstream
education.

One of the RDP goals and objectives, amongst others, was to  help  eliminate
poverty  and  general  inequity.  Here,  I  am  talking  about  the   uneven
development in different parts of our  country,  created  by  apartheid,  of
course, and the market's failure to meet basic needs.

I believe that the Bill before  this  House  today,  in  terms  of  all  the
amendments and the discussions that  have  taken  place  in  the  committee,
leads up to this aim or objective of the RDP. [Applause.]

Mr H T SOGONI:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  special  delegates  and  Salga
representatives, hon members, the Division of Revenue  Bill,  B5D  of  2002,
together with its amendments, to which all the provinces acceded,  is  fully
supported by the Eastern Cape province.

We are satisfied that the  necessary  constitutional  requirements  for  the
passage of the Bill have been fulfilled.  The  Treasury  complied  with  the
requirement of taking into consideration any recommendations made to  it  by
the FFC, as required by section 214(2) of the Constitution of  the  Republic
of South Africa, as well  as  section  9  of  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Relations Act of 1997,  taking  into  account  the  10  factors  of  section
214(2)(a) to (j) of the Constitution as reflected in part 2  of  Annexure  E
of the Bill.

Similarly,  sufficient   consultation   with   the   provinces   and   other
stakeholders,  through  the  NCOP  and  other  intergovernmental   channels,
completed the  process  of  interrogating  the  Bill  to  the  best  of  our
satisfaction as a province.

The body of amendments proposed and discussed during the committee stage  of
the Bill was designed to improve the quality of the Bill and to  make  it  a
better and more refined product than the existing Act.

Regarding part 1 of the Bill, we welcome the promotion of the principles  of
co-operative governance and accountability  outlined  in  this  section,  as
well as the mechanism to ensure that  proper  financial  management  systems
are strictly adhered to.

The Government faces a huge task and constitutional obligations  to  redress
past imbalances, and we need to safeguard all  available  resources  against
corruption, negligent and/or fruitless utilisation.

The Treasury has not reviewed the equitable share  formula,  as  recommended
by the FFC, but we welcome its undertaking to do so  when  the  2001  Census
results are available, and also  on  the  basis  of  changes  in  provinces'
fiscal capacity, owing to some taxation powers in the  future.  The  Eastern
Cape is also satisfied, therefore, that ongoing consultations will  continue
to improve the distribution of the equitable share of state revenue.

The FFC proposals on provinces' own revenue is  another  interesting  debate
between the commission and Treasury. The Eastern Cape has a particular  view
that was expressed during public hearings in 2001 on this matter.  On  local
government allocation of equitable share, the Eastern  Cape  refers  to  the
submission by Salga of the need to review, and  I  quote:  ``The  assumption
that local government covers up to 90% of its own  revenue'',  which,  as  a
consequence,  impacts  on  the  allocation  of  equitable   share   to   the
municipalities''.  Salga  argues  that  this  assumption  is  not   correct,
especially, and I quote again: ``... with regard to  rural  areas''.  It  is
interesting to note the response of the Treasury to this argument.

During the public hearings and the discussions at committee  level  we  were
made to understand the reasons  as  to  why  allocation  figures  for  local
government  equitable  share  are  still  outstanding.   We   accepted   the
explanation that  local  government  and  Treasury  still  had  to  conclude
consultations on the separation of functions between the B and C  categories
of municipalities. Treasury gave an undertaking that the  figures  would  be
finalised no later than April 2002.

Part 4 of this Bill also deserves comment. The provisions on the  duties  of
accounting officers and treasuries indeed enhance oversight of  the  Budget.
This  becomes  evident  when  we  consider  the  responsibilities   of   the
transferring and receiving officers at national and provincial  governments,
and to a certain extent at local government level.

The  Eastern  Cape  wishes  to  express  a  concern  by  the   majority   of
departments, including Treasury, during public hearings, that provinces  and
municipalities  lack  the  capacity  to  spend  allocated  resources.   This
situation is partly due to a lack of or poor infrastructure on  the  ground,
or some other factors. This shortcoming, in our view, impacts negatively  on
service delivery to the poorest of our communities.

Under such circumstances we therefore cannot realise, be it in the short  or
long term, the desired effect of revenue allocation.  In  fact,  efforts  to
improve capacity to spend remain a top priority in  our  view.  The  Eastern
Cape  is,  therefore,  satisfied  that  the  national  Treasury  has   taken
seriously  the  inputs  from   the   province   and   all   the   applicable
recommendations of the FFC. Likewise, the proposals for  amendments  by  the
office of the Auditor-General and  provinces  were  also  dealt  with  in  a
manner that promotes transparency and consultation in  order  to  make  this
Bill an effective tool to distribute national revenue as the law requires.

In conclusion, once more, the Eastern Cape supports the Division of  Revenue
Bill with its amendments. [Applause.]

Mnr J L THERON: Agb Voorsitter en Adjunkminister, in die Wetsontwerp op  die
Verdeling van Inkomste gaan dit om die verdeling van die staat  se  inkomste
op 'n vertikale en horisontale basis. Vertikaal gaan dit  om  die  verdeling
van die inkomste tussen die drie  sfere  van  regering,  naamlik  nasionaal,
provinsiaal en plaaslik. Horisontaal is dit natuurlik die  verdeling  tussen
die nege provinsiale regerings en op plaaslike vlak tussen die  verskillende
munisipaliteite.

Ek wil graag ook kyk na  die  hoofdoelwitte  wat  nagestreef  word  met  die
verdeling van inkomste en  dit  sluit  die  volgende  in:  Bespoediging  van
dienslewering en die verbetering van kwaliteit van die  publieke  sektor  se
dienslewering wat  betref  armoede,  ongelykhede  en  kwesbaarheid  van  die
publiek; die bystand van provinsiale en plaaslike  regerings  om  'n  groter
rol te speel met hul sosiale programme, veral dié gerig  op  armoede  en  om
ekonomiese groei en werkskepping te bevorder; die uitbreiding van  die  hulp
om jong kinders  se  ontwikkeling  te  bevorder,  toegang  tot  onderwys  en
spesiale  hulp  aan   wiskunde-   en   wetenskaponderwys,   investering   in
konstruksierehabilitasie en onderhoud van  infrastruktuur,  hoofsaaklik  wat
betref onderwys, gesondheid en vervoer; hulp aan munisipaliteite te  verskaf
om die munisipale infrastruktuur uit te bou en om hulpbronne  doelgerig  aan
te wend in die benadeelde areas soos geïdentifiseer  in  die  geïntegreerde,
volhoubare landelike ontwikkelings- en  stedelike  vernuwingsprogramme.  Die
DA onderskryf natuurlik hierdie doelwitte wat nagestreef word ten  volle  en
ons sal ons volle samewerking verleen, waar moontlik, in die uitvoering  van
dié programme om hierdie doelwitte te bereik.

Vervolgens konsentreer ek op die vertikale verdeling. Dié  verdeling  tussen
die drie sfere van regering is uiters  belangrik  om  te  verseker  dat  die
nodige  fondse  vloei  na  areas  waar  dit  die   noodsaaklikste   is   vir
dienslewering aan die publiek. In die 2002-03 verdeling  van  inkomste  word
die inkomste só verdeel dat 40% na nasionaal gaan;  56%  provinsiaal  en  4%
plaaslik. Dit beteken dat R96,1 miljard gaan na nasionale; R132  miljard  na
provinsiale en R8,5 miljard na plaaslike regering.

Die oordragte van provinsiale regering neem  twee  vorme  aan,  naamlik  die
gedeelte  volgens   die   gelykstellingsformule   en   die   gespesifiseerde
toekenning,  of  ``conditional  grants''.  Hierdie  gedeelte,  volgens   die
gelykstellingsformule of ``equitable share'', maak  90%  van  die  oordragte
aan die provinsies uit en die gespesifiseerde  toekennings  die  oorblywende
10%. Die oordragte na die plaaslike regering toon die  grootste  styging  in
die 2002-03-begroting waar dit styg met 18,3% oor die MTEF-tydperk.  Hierdie
groot stygings moet meehelp in  die  lewering  van  die  basiese  munisipale
dienste, infrastruktuurontwikkeling en  die  hervorming  van  die  plaaslike
regeringstelsel. Van die 284 nuwe munisipaliteite wat  gevorm  is,  maak  23
van hulle 80% van die plaaslike regeringsbegroting  uit.  Hierdie  ontleding
wys op die groot konsentrasie van ekonomiese  bedrywighede  in  sekere  dele
van Suid-Afrika waaraan ernstig aandag verleen sal moet word  indien  gelyke
verdelings verkry wil word.

Wat  betref  die  horisontale  verdeling,  die  verdeling  tussen  die  nege
provinsies word gedoen deur die gelykstellingsformule toe  te  pas.  Hierdie
formule doen die verdeling met  inagname  van  die  verskillende  ekonomiese
profiele, demografiese verskille en sosioekonomiese  omstandighede  van  die
verskillende provinsies. Volgens die formule is  die  verdeling  tussen  die
provinsies soos volg: Oos-Kaap, 26%; Vrystaat, 12%; Gauteng,  13%;  KwaZulu-
Natal, 18%; Mpumalanga, 5%; Noordkaap, 4%; Noordelike Provinsie of  Limpopo,
10%; Noordwes, 7%, en Weskaap, 5%.

Wat kapasiteitsuitbreiding betref, is die grootste enkele probleem  wat  met
provinsiale en plaaslike regeringsfinansies ondervind word, dat  die  nodige
fasiliteit nie bestaan om die oorgedraagde fondse effektief te  kan  aanwend
nie. Groot ontwikkelings- en opleidingsbehoeftes ontstaan in die  provinsies
en op plaaslike vlak, wat aangespreek moet word. Daarom  word  daar  ook  in
die Wetsontwerp  op  die  Verdeling  van  Inkomste  voorsiening  gemaak  vir
spesifieke oordragte na die provinsies en die  plaaslike  vlak,  om  hierdie
nodige kapasiteitsuitbreidings te kan doen.

So ontvang provinsies twee spesifieke  toekennings  om  kapasiteit  te  help
opbou, naamlik  die  plaaslike  regeringsondersteuningstoekenning  van  R474
miljoen  en  die  gekonsolideerde   munisipale   infrastruktuurprogram   van
R333 miljoen. Op plaaslike vlak word verskillende  toekennings  geamalgemeer
in die munisipale stelsel  vir  'n  verbetering  in  toekenning.  As  gevolg
hiervan verhoog hierdie toekenning tot R93 miljoen vir 2002-03.

Die     totale      toekennings      vir      kapasiteitsuitbreiding      en
herstruktureringsprogramme op plaaslike vlak beloop  R548 miljoen  in  2002-
03,  R577 miljoen   vir   2003-04   en   R624 miljoen   vir   2004-05.   Dit
verteenwoordig 'n gemiddelde jaarlikse verhoging van 4,7% oor dié periode.

Ek sluit af. Dit is so dat baie werk nog voorlê op provinsiale en  plaaslike
regeringsvlak  wat  doeltreffende  bestuur  van   finansies   betref.   Baie
vordering is reeds gemaak en ek wil die departement weer eens gelukwens  met
die werk wat gedoen word. Met hierdie wetsontwerp is dit weer  duidelik  dat
vordering reeds gemaak is en dat die  staatsfinansies  onder  goeie  bestuur
staan. Die DA steun daarom hierdie wetsontwerp met die tegniese  amendemente
wat aanbeveel is. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Hon Chairperson and Deputy  Minister,  in  the  Division  of
Revenue Bill the issue is the division of the state's revenue on a  vertical
and a horizontal basis. Vertically the issue  is  the  division  of  revenue
between the three spheres of government,  namely  national,  provincial  and
local. Horizontally,  of  course,  it  is  the  division  between  the  nine
provincial  governments   and   at   local   level   between   the   various
municipalities.

I would also like to look at the primary objectives  which  are  pursued  in
the division  of  revenue,  and  these  include  the  following:  expediting
service delivery and the improvement of the quality of the  public  sector's
service delivery as regards poverty, inequality  and  vulnerability  of  the
public; the assisting of provincial and local governments to play a  greater
role in their social programmes, particularly those  aimed  at  poverty  and
promoting economic growth and job creation; the expansion of  assistance  to
promote the development of young children, access to education  and  special
help  for  mathematics  and  science  teaching,  investing  in  construction
rehabilitation and the maintenance of infrastructure, primarily with  regard
to  education,  health  and   transport;   providing   the   assistance   to
municipalities  to  expand  the  municipal  infrastructure  and  to  utilise
resources purposefully in the  disadvantaged  areas  as  identified  in  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development and Urban Renewal  Programmes.  The
DA naturally fully endorses these objectives which are pursued, and we  will
give our  full  co-operation  where  possible  in  the  execution  of  these
programmes to achieve these objectives.

I will now concentrate on the vertical division. This division  between  the
three spheres of government is extremely important in order to  ensure  that
the necessary funds flow to areas where they are most essential for  service
delivery to the public. In the 2002-03 division of revenue, the  revenue  is
divided in such a way that 40% is  allocated  nationally;  56%  provincially
and 4% locally. That means that R96,1 billion goes to  national  government;
R132 billion to provincial and R8,5 billion to local government.

The transfers of provincial government take two forms,  namely  the  portion
according to the equitable share formula and  the  specified  allocation  or
conditional  grants.  This  portion  according  to   the   equitable   share
constitutes 90% of the  transfers  to  the  provinces  and  the  conditional
grants constitute the remaining 10%. The transfers to local government  show
the greatest increase in the 2002-03 budget, where they  increase  by  18,3%
over the MTEF period. These sharp increases must assist in the  delivery  of
basic municipal services, infrastructure development and the reform  of  the
local government system. Of  the  284  new  municipalities  that  have  been
formed, 23 constitute 80% of the  local  government  budget.  This  analysis
points out the great concentration of economic activities in  certain  parts
of South Africa, to  which  serious  attention  will  have  to  be  paid  if
equitable distributions are to be obtained.

As regards the horizontal division, the division between the nine  provinces
is done by applying the equitable share formula. This  formula  effects  the
division taking into account  the  various  economic  profiles,  demographic
differences  and  socioeconomic  conditions  of   the   various   provinces.
According to the formula the division between the provinces is  as  follows:
Eastern Cape, 26%;  Free  State,  12%;  Gauteng,  13%;  KwaZulu-Natal,  18%;
Mpumalanga, 5%; Northern Cape, 4%; Northern Province or Limpopo, 10%;  North
West, 7%; and Western Cape, 5%.

As far as capacity expansion is concerned, the single biggest problem  which
is experienced with provincial and local government  finances  is  that  the
necessary facility does not exist to be  able  effectively  to  utilise  the
transferred funds.  Great  development  and  training  needs  exist  in  the
provinces and at the local level, which have  to  be  addressed.  Therefore,
provision is also  made  in  the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  for  specific
transfers to the provinces and the local level, to  be  able  to  carry  out
this necessary capacity expansion.

In this way  provinces  receive  two  specific  allocations  to  help  build
capacity, namely the local government support  allocation  of  R474  million
and the consolidated municipal infrastructure programme of R333 million.  At
the local level various allocations are amalgamated in the municipal  system
for an improvement in allocation. As a result of this,  this  allocation  is
increased to R93 million for 2002-03.

The total allocations for capacity expansion  and  restructuring  programmes
at the local level amount to R548 million in 2002-03, R577 million for 2003-
04 and R624 million for 2004-05. This represents an average annual  increase
of 4,7% over the period.

I wish to conclude. It is true that a great deal of work  still  lies  ahead
at the provincial and local government level as far as efficient  management
of finances is concerned. A great deal of progress  has  already  been  made
and I would once again like to congratulate the department on the work  that
has been done. With this Bill it is  once  again  clear  that  progress  has
already been made and that government finances are  under  good  management.
The DA therefore supports this Bill  with  the  technical  amendments  which
have been recommended.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, Deputy Minister, special  delegates  and  members,
it is an honour to address this august House  on  the  Division  of  Revenue
Bill of 2002.

My key focus will be on  the  housing  grants.  The  Department  of  Housing
administers two grants: the housing subsidy fund provides subsidies for low-
income housing, and the Human Settlement  Redevelopment  grant  funds  urban
pilot projects.

The housing allocation increases by  R300  million  in  the  financial  year
commencing 1 April 2002, and by a total of R12 billion over  the  three-year
period. While this will enable  the  Department  of  Housing  to  accelerate
housing delivery in urban areas, the focus will be on improving the  quality
of housing units through an  increase  in  the  subsidy  level  and  through
implementing the medium-density housing strategy.
It is crucial to note that in the  previous  financial  year  23,9%  of  the
total value of provincial conditional  grants  was  for  the  housing  fund,
although the spending on this  grant  is  projected  to  reach  93%  by  the
financial year  ending  31  March  2002.  This  can  be  attributed  to  the
following. From a slow start in 1995-96 the pace  of  housing  delivery  has
increased substantially. Up to March  1998  Government  contributed  to  the
construction of over 500 000 houses. Delivery peaked in  1997-98  with  over
322 638 houses. This may reflect  a  carrying  over  of  projects  from  the
previous two years after the initiation of the housing policy.

Between 1998 and March 2001 Government contributed to over  650 000  houses.
Delivery in 2000-01 slowed down to about 170 000 houses,  and  this  may  be
attributed mainly to delays in completion of projects by developers  towards
the end of the construction phase, to weak capacity and  planning,  to  last
year's municipal elections and  demarcation  process,  and  to  unfavourable
weather patterns.

The variation in the pace of delivery is also evident in the extent of roll-
overs in housing subsidy funds. Where  provincial  housing  departments  had
roll-overs of over R2,2 billion or 71% of allocated  housing  subsidy  funds
in 1995-96, they had estimated roll-overs of R519 million or  15%  in  2000-
01. It is clear from this that certain  obstacles  to  sustainable  delivery
have been identified and Government continues to explore ways  to  speed  up
delivery and to contribute to the development of sustainable settlements.

Financial management in the sector has improved.  Further  steps  are  being
taken to  improve  and  streamline  the  funding  arrangements  for  housing
programmes.  These  include  converting  the  housing  subsidy  grants  into
conditional grants, resulting in all funds received  by  provincial  housing
departments being deposited into the appropriate  provincial  revenue  fund,
improving accountability for such  funds.  Also,  all  expenditure  incurred
with respect to housing will be on  budget  and  this  includes  expenditure
incurred by the respective provincial housing funds.
With regard to the implementation of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,
progress has been made. Steps have been taken  to  appoint  chief  financial
officers in provincial departments responsible for  housing,  and  this  has
led to the establishment of a CFO forum which will  charter  a  way  forward
with further reforms in  financial  management.  All  provinces  have  audit
committees and seven provinces have established internal audit committees.

Despite the major achievements, the low-income housing sector  continues  to
be hamstrung by factors that  include  poor  capacity,  lack  of  finance  -
private and public - and inadequate  planning  and  implementation.  A  more
focused strategy is needed to address  the  challenges  facing  the  housing
sector, especially to ensure  access  for  private  funding,  an  integrated
approach, emergency housing and rapid land release.

Sustainable low-cost  housing  delivery  requires  a  joint  effort  between
Government and the private sector. Government  has  initiated  a  number  of
strategies to encourage private-sector  participation  in  low-cost  housing
finance. Through the establishment of Servcon Housing  Solutions  (Pty)  Ltd
in 1998 Government aimed to normalise the lending  environment  by  managing
nonperforming loans and properties repossessed by banks in  areas  in  which
the normal legal process had broken down.

In addition, the Masakhane campaign was launched to change  the  perceptions
and attitude of  individuals,  communities  and  local  governments  towards
their responsibilities. It encourages the payment  of  rates,  services  and
bonds, and thus  seeks  to  inculcate  an  overall  culture  of  payment  in
affected communities.

Thubelisha Homes was established in 1998 as  a  finance  vehicle  to  create
rightsizing stock, and is linked to  the  Servcon  programme.  The  National
Urban Reconstruction and Housing Agency  provides  guarantees  to  banks  to
encourage  them  to  make  bridging  finance  loans  available  to  emerging
developers and contractors when banks  are  not  prepared  to  approve  such
loans without additional security.
Despite Government attempts to normalise the housing  environment,  private-
sector participation in low-cost housing remains elusive.  Mortgage  lending
in this sector is nonexistent. Further, Government recognises the  need  for
an integrated strategy in housing delivery. Municipalities  play  a  limited
direct role in housing development,  generally  as  developers  and  in  the
provision of internal bulk and connector infrastructure.

Co-ordination of initiatives at the local level is  often  weak,  and  grant
spending is not  optimised.  Ways  are  currently  being  explored  to  have
municipalities play  a  greater  role  in  housing  delivery,  which  should
improve local programme  co-ordination  and  speed  up  delivery.  This  may
include transferring funds directly to municipalities.

Government also recognises that housing  delivery  requires  not  only  bulk
infrastructure and housing units, but  properly  integrated  communities  in
the built environment. Many current housing projects do not take  the  total
basic needs of communities into account. In many cases housing projects  are
not completed taking social and economic infrastructure into  account,  such
as  schools,  roads,  clinics  and  retail  facilities.  Businesses   remain
reluctant to invest in townships and new housing developments.

In general,  following  a  difficult  transition,  the  housing  sector  has
emerged stronger and better equipped to deal with the challenges facing  it.
Policy has improved, management is more proactive and finances  look  sound.
The successes gained can serve as a solid platform for  further  reforms  in
the housing delivery strategies.

With regard to the Free State, local government and housing will receive  an
additional allocation of R57,143 million  in  2002-03,  R40,980  million  in
2003-04 and R64,470 million in 2004-05.  My  province  will  make  concerted
attempts to make affordable housing available to as many people as  possible
over the MTEF period through the  effective  and  efficient  utilisation  of
grants for housing, human settlement and local government support.  A  total
amount of R317 million is budgeted for these functions in 2002-03, and  will
increase by 10,1% to R349,2 million in 2003-04, and by a  further  16,2%  to
R405,78 million in 2004-05. During the  public  hearings  we  were  informed
that 26 088 houses were built in the Free State during  the  financial  year
2000-01. This is roughly 15% of the total number  of  houses  built  in  the
country for the same period.

The Free State supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, Deputy Minister of Finance and  colleagues,  the
purpose of this Bill is, in a nutshell, mainly to  make  provision  for  the
equitable division of nationally raised revenue among the three  spheres  of
government and  to  promote  co-operative  governance  in  intergovernmental
budgeting.

The principle of the Bill is informed by section 214(1) of the  Constitution
and by the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations  Act  of  1997.  The  Bill  is
designed, in the first instance, to promote  a  whole  series  of  financial
management goals. These goals are  co-operative  governance  in  the  Budget
allocation and transport processes; better co-ordination between the  policy
formulation,  planning,  budget   preparation   and   execution   processes;
predictability and certainty in respect of  all  allocations  to  provincial
and local governments; and accountability for the use  of  public  resources
by ensuring that all transfers are reflected in the  budgets  of  benefiting
provincial and local governments and that they are subjected to audits.  The
Bill is also designed to ensure transparency and equity in  all  allocations
and in the criteria used in the division thereof.

In the Bill being debated today all three spheres of  government  receive  a
real increase in their equitable shares over the medium-term  period.  Local
government, in particular, experiences real growth of 14,7%  over  the  same
MTEF period.  While  real  growth  is  lowest  for  the  Western  Cape,  the
provinces of Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng, they  have  the  largest
real increases in their equitable shares.  Gauteng  has  been  allocated  an
equitable  share  amounting  to  R18,2  billion  and  a  conditional   grant
amounting to R3,4 billion, with  the  total  allocation  from  the  national
Treasury amounting to R21,7 billion.

The only change to the equitable formula is  the  increase  in  the  welfare
weighting by one, at the cost of economic weighting. It  is  hoped  that  by
increasing the welfare share, provinces will manage to control the  spending
on these services.

On a national basis, health still receives the largest share of  conditional
grants,  which  are  mainly  earmarked  for  tertiary  hospitals,  training,
rehabilitation and nutrition, while the central hospital and  redistribution
grants  have  been  reconfigured  into  a  consolidated  national   tertiary
services grant to ensure that all South Africans have equitable access to  a
basic level of tertiary health care.

The Bill also provides for two new grants  to  provinces  to  support  local
government. The local government share rises  rapidly  by  18,3%  from  R6,5
billion in 2001-02, to R10,8 billion in 2004-05. This increase in  share  is
attributable to smaller municipalities  receiving  larger  shares.  It  also
includes   transfers   to   category   C   municipalities   and    municipal
infrastructure development, in especially the poor  nodal  areas  identified
for rural development and urban renewal.

The  capacity  problems  experienced  at  local  government  level  in   the
administration and spending of  the  allocated  conditional  grants  is  the
major challenge of this Bill. However, it takes a significant  step  towards
promoting  transparency  and  accountability  of  Government   spending   by
implementing the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act.

Gauteng has taken cognisance of the reporting  requirements  by  responsible
parties such as the  provincial  treasury,  by  provincial  departments  and
municipalities receiving transfers from the province, and specifically  also
that municipalities must submit reports to the  relevant  department  within
10 days after the end of  each  month.  The  Bill  also  sets  out  specific
obligations on the reporting of conditional grants to  be  included  in  the
financial reports submitted for auditing purposes to the Auditor-General.

I am pleased to report that all the concerns raised by the  Gauteng  finance
committee in the negotiating mandate were addressed. Our  province  welcomes
the  amendment  of  clauses  8,  18(2),  20,  27(3),  27(5)  and  29(3).  It
furthermore welcomes the change made to  clause  5(2),  which  ensures  that
category C municipalities are not excluded from  the  equitable  share.  The
committee also took cognisance of  the  support  expressed  by  the  Gauteng
member of the executive council  for  finance  and  is  satisfied  that  the
revenue allocated to Gauteng through the equitable  share  will  enable  our
provincial government to meet its stated policy priorities.

In conclusion, Gauteng supports the principle and detail of the Division  of
Revenue Bill and will vote  in  favour  of  its  adoption.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Chairperson, exactly what I have said for Gauteng I say  on  behalf  of  the
New NP, and we support the Bill. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr L S GABELA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister  and  hon
members, I thank you for the opportunity to address  this  honourable  House
on the Division of Revenue  Bill  for  2002-03.  From  the  outset,  let  me
indicate that I have been mandated to focus on matters of local  government,
with particular reference to conditional grants.

Also, just in passing, I would like to indicate  our  appreciation  for  the
work that is being done in relation to a matter that has  been  through  the
courts  on  the  equitable  share  and   the   exclusion   of   category   C
municipalities. All that is being done in a bid to  redress  this  situation
is appreciated.

The Division of Revenue Bill, as we all know, aims at  directly  intervening
in reducing  poverty  and  vulnerability,  and  at  contributing  to  social
development. The improvement in the quality of life where  our  people  live
demands much of capacity on the part of local government in order to  be  in
a position to deliver.

The newly demarcated municipalities require concerted effort in striving  to
address backlogs in basic municipal infrastructure and services.  The  point
needs to be made that we still have municipalities, newly established  ones,
that still do not have a rate base and that have no income at all.

We would not want to suggest that therefore these municipalities  must  live
only on hand-outs. We understand that  through  local  economic  development
projects, these municipalities would have to be in a position in which  they
can sustain themselves.

We also want to make a  point,  as  the  hon  chairperson  of  the  Standing
Committee on Finance has made, on the grants in  kind.  There  needs  to  be
improvement in communication in relation  to  community-based  Public  Works
programmes. There is an abundance of community halls, in particular  in  our
province, and other forms of infrastructure which  are  not  being  used  by
local communities, because there has not been  consultation  as  to  whether
these forms of infrastructure met the requirements of local  communities.  I
think it would be greatly appreciated if we could improve this situation.

In relation to conditional grants, we would also  want  to  make  the  point
that while national Government may have  checks  and  balances  as  to  what
these moneys would be used for in terms of making sure that  they  are  used
for a desired purpose, provinces also  have  to  be  assisted  in  terms  of
capacity-building.

I here note the point made by the Deputy Minister  earlier  in  relation  to
the distribution of specialists throughout provinces but the point  here  is
that there has to be close monitoring. We need not have  a  situation  where
there is intervention only when things go wrong. In  some  instances  things
go wrong when it might have been possible to intervene in time.

We have skills shortages in local  government  and  funds  appropriated  for
certain purposes are not used for those purposes. Part  of  the  problem  is
the  exorbitant  salaries   of   officials   in   local   government.   Some
municipalities cannot afford councillor remuneration. There is failure  even
to produce IDPs, and we tend to have a problem  as  to  how  people  approve
their budgets if they are not even in a position to produce  an  operational
plan.

This, I am told, is a concurrent  responsibility,  but  national  Government
has a much bigger role to play in this regard. I am saying this  unashamedly
because we also have a similar problem in my own province, in that there  is
no legislation or policy  that  regulates  municipal  support  services  and
capacity-building,  for  instance.  This  is  an  issue  that  needs  to  be
addressed. Of course we also do have a problem with the abundance of  staff.
Just less than 400 of those who work for the so-called R293  townships,  the
majority have had to be placed on special leave  because  they  are  neither
skilled nor trainable.

It is part of our history and it is something that we will have  to  contend
with for some time, but these are the problems that we need to face. We  are
happy that there is a clear directive from national Treasury  and  the  fact
that it will work with provinces, municipalities  and  local  government  in
improving towards  achieving  better  delivery.  Our  emphasis  on  national
overall supervision is informed by the fact  that  it  is  well  known  that
there is no capacity. If there is no capacity  then  it  is  important  that
there is intervention in time.

Let me also take this opportunity to raise  an  issue  in  relation  to  the
rural nodal points. It is well known that there are nodal points in KwaZulu-
Natal, and I have no intention to politicise this matter,  but  we  want  to
say that it would be appreciated if the  national  Government,  particularly
at the level of the two Ministers who are mandated by Cabinet to  facilitate
the speedy realisation of this programme, would do their level best  to  see
to it that the desired goals are met.  We  know  that  there  are  problems,
political problems, but if such problems could  be  attended  to  ...  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, this is the first time  I  have  spoken  in  this
Chamber since we were chased away from the NCOP Chamber, so I  am  not  used
to this technology yet. [Interjections.] Yes, it  is  my  maiden  speech  in
this Chamber.

Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister  of  Finance,  hon  special  and  permanent
delegates, our intergovernmental fiscal relations are on a sound footing.  A
strong foundation has been  laid  and  one  can  proclaim  without  fear  or
hesitation that we are indeed moving in the right direction.  Clearly  these
strong fiscal relations entrench and support our Constitution on  the  issue
of better and efficient co-operative governance.

Today provinces and municipalities can plan  their  budgets  and  programmes
under conditions of greater certainty  and  predictability,  thanks  to  the
MTEF cycle introduced by our central Government.

Our provincial government and the municipalities in the Northern  Cape  have
begun to grapple with this effective and  efficient  way  of  budgeting  and
planning processes, and to a large degree we have begun to use this to  meet
our constitutional mandate.

The Division of  Revenue  Bill  before  this  House  clearly  expresses  the
willingness and commitment of  our  Government  to  addressing  poverty  and
underdevelopment in our society.  I  wish  to  qualify  this  expression  of
commitment by our Government by indicating that this Bill allocates  to  our
province, the Northern Cape, an  equitable  share  which  amounts  to  a  9%
increase. This is equivalent to a real increase  of  approximately  4%  over
and above inflation.

This clearly is a positive response on the part of  our  central  Government
to the continuous lobbying by our  province  for  an  increased  allocation.
Since 1998 our share has grown by over a billion rand. This has resulted  in
our per capita allocation being 20% above the  national  average.  Now  that
clearly expresses the commitment of  our  central  Government  to  assisting
provinces in meeting their constitutional mandates.

The equitable share allocation, together with  conditional  grants  and  our
own provincially collected  revenue,  amount  to  R3,238  billion  for  this
financial year. This increased revenue base has created an  opportunity  for
the province to aggressively fight against poverty and underdevelopment.

Therefore our budget in the province responds to this commitment by  clearly
balancing our social development obligations  and  the  stimulation  of  our
economy through growth and job creation. We would  not  have  been  able  to
achieve this without the support of our national Government, which acted  in
a caring and compassionate manner towards our plea.

For the next financial year we intend to use all the resources allocated  to
us through the conditional grants for their intended purpose. For  instance,
we plan to spent about R24 million on the rehabilitation and improvement  of
hospitals and clinics to ensure that our people receive better  health  care
facilities.

We also intend to use the  entire  R75  million  allocated  to  us  for  the
construction of 4 000 new housing units  for  this  financial  year.  I  can
report that our province is one those who perform best with  regard  to  the
provision of houses in that  we  have  used  about  90%  of  our  allocation
towards the building of houses in the past financial year.

We also intend to build three new schools in the province  and  rehabilitate
other  schools  and  colleges  to  ensure  that  we  meet  our   President's
commitment to ensuring that in three years' time  no  child  will  still  be
learning under a tree. We can say without fear that we will ensure  that  in
the Northern Cape in three years' time no child will learn under a tree.

In this  financial  year  we  intend  to  use  about  R33  million  for  the
construction  of  new  roads  and  the  upgrading  of  the  existing  roads'
infrastructure in the province. This will largely benefit our  rural  people
and our farming community. We are convinced that we  would  have  done  much
less than intended if it had not  been  for  the  support  of  the  national
Government. These are just indications of our commitment to  addressing  the
issue of our infrastructural backlog and building a  competitive  provincial
economy that contributes positively to the national economy of our  country.


Within the two nodal points identified by  the  hon  the  President,  namely
Galeshewe and Kgalagadi, work has begun. The  people  of  these  nodes  have
responded with enthusiasm and they themselves have taken overall  leadership
in ensuring the success of these programmes.

Again, thanks to the central Government for the  additional  allocations  to
these nodes. We have therefore projected that for the  next  MTEF  cycle  we
will  spend  about  R130  million  and  R110  million  respectively  in  the
Galeshewe and Kgalagadi nodes. People in  these  areas  are  convinced  that
after 2004 we will have made decisive strides  in  eradicating  poverty  and
underdevelopment. Indeed, our people are confident that a  better  life  for
all, which is a vision of the national Government, is achievable.

Our municipal  fiscal  position  in  the  province  has  improved  and  most
municipalities are in  a  healthy  state.  It  has  also  emerged  that  our
municipalities have begun to use conditional grants effectively  to  deliver
basic services.

We all know that last year we  debated  the  issue  of  the  Provincial  Tax
Regulation Process Act, which was passed  by  this  national  Government  in
2001, and which effectively bestows on  our  province  some  taxing  powers.
However, as a province we need to take a cautious approach and  balance  the
need to raise revenue without  unduly  increasing  the  tax  burden  of  the
citizens of our province.

Over the next financial year, we intend to thoroughly  examine  the  options
and the potential impact of this Act on the regional economy and on that  of
our province. Our MEC has appointed an advisory committee,  which  comprises
a tax expert, a chartered accountant, an  economist,  a  banker  and  a  few
state officials, to commence initial  investigations  into  this  matter  of
provincial taxation. We are confident and want to  express  our  willingness
that we need to make sure that this Act, which was  passed  by  this  House,
does work and that the province's own revenue is increased.

In conclusion, as a province we are committed to the  total  eradication  of
poverty and underdevelopment. No rational thinking  human  being  can  sleep
quietly and peacefully at night while there  are  people  living  in  abject
poverty, while our children learn under trees  and  while  some  of  us  are
unemployed and without an income. Therefore, our struggle for  the  creation
of a better life for all must be accelerated. As a province we support  this
Bill and approve the amendments that have been made. [Applause.]

Ms S SITHOLE (Northern Province): Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister  and  the
House at large, I have been ordered by the committee  on  finance,  economic
affairs, environment and  tourism  of  the  Limpopo  province  to  come  and
support this Bill. So the support is very clear. It is not something that  I
am coming to talk about, it is an order!

When the committee ordered me to do  this,  I  had  to  ask  them  why  they
ordered me to do this, and whether it was because I am  the  only  woman  in
the committee. But members of the committee substantiated their reasons  for
the order. They said that it had come to the notice of  the  committee  that
ever since the new democracy there has been a change in  South  Africa  -  a
change in the manner in which funds are allocated and the  manner  in  which
resources are managed. That is the reason they support this Bill.

They said we should actually pause and ask ourselves where we come from.  We
come from a past where people of South Africa did not  know  anything  about
how and when moneys were allocated. There was no transparency. They are  not
sure whether there was accountability. That is the past we come from.

This House will remember that for the first  time  in  1997  or  1998  South
Africa's Government started to be serious about repaying the national  debt,
that is the debt we had incurred. And we all know here  that  for  10  years
before then, moneys were borrowed and used without  any  repayment  at  all.
So, this Government came  with  the  sense  of  responsibility  actually  to
encourage repayment of the national debt.

We also noted that the intention of the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  is  to
increase co-operative governance, which is key to  actually  making  maximum
use  of  the  scarce  resources  that  we  have  in  this  country.  So   we
congratulate the Department of Finance  on  the  steps  taken  in  fostering
accountability and promoting good governance, and  on  the  desire  to  work
together with provinces.

We have noted and this House has listened as the hon Deputy Minister  stated
the stages  when  the  allocation  of  funds  takes  place,  that  there  is
involvement of all the  provinces,  including  local  government,  and  that
everybody actually knows at the end of the day  that  one  is  getting  this
share because of one, two, three. Furthermore, the  recommendations  of  the
FFC have been taken on board by the Department of Finance.  But,  as  a  new
democracy, we should remember that we are not a First World democracy.  Some
of the recommendations of the FFC will take some time completely  to  comply
with, because of where we  come  from.  So,  it  is  important  that,  as  a
country, when we talk about  financial  management  we  actually  understand
ourselves, we understand the stage of our democracy and where we come  from.


We  must  also  understand  that  in  the  relationships  between  the  FFC,
Government, the public, legislatures and Parliament there are  bound  to  be
tensions, and that those are necessary tensions. What is  important  is  how
we deal with the tensions. They are healthy tensions because of  the  nature
of our deployment to different stations.

We have also noted that regarding the division  of  revenue,  Government  is
serious about accountability and transparency,  especially  the  latter.  We
noted that there is a new  section  on  skills  development  funding,  which
funds come from the private sector and are  dedicated  to  the  training  of
personnel.

We have also noted that there is now  clarity  on  donor  funding.  We  have
noted, as the finance committee, that all that donor funding has been  there
all the time, but we did not actually see how it was  spent.  This  Division
of Revenue Bill makes it very  clear  to  everybody  how  donor  funding  is
received and spent.

We also  noted  that  the  Department  of  Finance  is  very  serious  about
accountability. Regarding this issue, we did not want to believe it, but  as
a responsible committee on finance we set out in our own way of testing  the
ground. We actually spoke to all heads of department and asked them to  give
us all the reports, the early warning reports that  they  send  to  Treasury
and the committee, and the financial  statements  which  they  send  to  the
Auditor-General every three months. We asked them to  make  these  available
to the committee. Throughout the years, the  fiscal  year  ending  31  March
2002 included, the committee has been receiving these reports  and  we  have
been engaging accounting officers, heads of department and  their  financial
officers to actually come and  appear  before  the  committee  and  give  us
progress reports. I am pleased to report that the department has been  doing
exactly that and, as a committee, we are  satisfied  that  they  are  really
trying their best to acclimatise themselves with  the  requirements  of  the
Public Finance Management Act.

I have also been mandated by the province  to  remind  the  hon  the  Deputy
Minister that our province's public works  department  has  been  doing  its
very best to spend the flood disaster allocation. We  want  to  appeal  that
the period for transferring  funds  to  that  province  should  actually  be
looked at, because at times ... [Time expired.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon  members  of  this
House, special delegates, the executive mayor of my  district  council,  who
is here with the Salga mandate, and the officials from  the  department,  it
is a pleasure to address this House on an important debate such as  that  on
the Division of Revenue Bill, which, in essence, constitutes the  foundation
of this House.

The Select Committee on Finance has been very active  during  the  last  few
days. As members  of  this  select  committee,  we  attended  the  strategic
planning workshop in the first week of March this  year,  and  a  series  of
public hearings on the Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management  Bill
and the Division of Revenue Bill of 2002.

A constant subject emanating from the sessions, which has relevance for  the
Division of Revenue Bill at present  before  this  House,  is  the  need  to
resolve intergovernmental  disputes.  Although  intergovernmental  relations
are still evolving in South Africa, many of the contentious  matters  facing
them are quite universal. The absolute amounts allocated  to  the  different
spheres of government, as  well  as  the  control  of  the  distribution  of
financial resources, are extremely  contentious.  There  is  no  reason  for
South Africa to be exempted from  universal  contentions.  Intergovernmental
relations are dynamic and, inevitably, respond  to  challenges,  challenging
social, economic  and  political  relations.  Therefore,  conflicts  between
different spheres of government are logical because they often  compete  for
political hegemony and for a share of financial resources.

The challenge facing  South  Africa's  co-operative  governance  is  how  we
should resolve conflict between and within the sphere of government  without
undermining  the   spirit   of   co-operative   governance.   One   of   the
constitutional principles of intergovernmental relations is  the  obligation
of the spheres of government to co-operate with one another in mutual  trust
and  good  faith.  This  entails  avoiding  legal  proceedings  against  one
another, which, in other words, means to settle  intergovernmental  disputes
by nonjudicial means. Moreover, such an approach requires  resolution  on  a
political level instead of through  costly  litigation.  We  all  know  that
litigation is rule-based, whereas political  intervention  is  revolutionary
and democratically informed.
The recent conflict with regard to the nonallocation of equitable shares  to
district councils provides such an example. The Pietermaritzburg High  Court
ruled in favour of three IFP-led district  municipalities  which  challenged
as unconstitutional provisions in the Division of Revenue Act of 2001  which
do not allocate money to district councils.

The Minister of Finance,  in  his  reply  to  a  question  in  the  National
Assembly on 6 March 2002 adheres to the ethic  of  a  nonjudicial  approach.
The North West province encourages  such  approach  in  future  in  all  our
governmental disputes.

The North West province is of the view that no assessment of our  provincial
economy and developmental prospect can be  marshalled  successfully  without
acknowledging challenges placed before our local government  sphere  through
IDPs. Indications from interim IDPs suggest  that  local  municipalities  in
our province have identified a total of  1300  projects  with  an  estimated
value of R3 billion. The adoption and implementation of the final IDPs  will
clearly be a powerful instrument for  the  alleviation  of  poverty  through
local economic development and improved service delivery in our province.

Needless to mention,  our  province  does  have  some  vexing  developmental
challenges. Firstly, unemployment remains high, estimated at  43%.  This  is
the third highest figure for the army of unemployed in our country.

The highlights of the financial year ending in  March  2002  for  the  North
West province are the formulation of  an  internal  audit  committee  -  the
first annual report of the committee is expected in  July  2002  -  and  the
implementation of the Public Finance Management Act. The province  commenced
with phase 2 of the implementation of the  PFMA.  The  registered  successes
were the finalisation of the appointment of  chief  financial  officers  and
the  monthly  closure  of  account  books  to  meet   with   the   reporting
requirements of the PFMA.

The increased equitable share in our province will go  a  long  way  towards
improving service delivery across all disciplines, especially in  benefiting
the rural unemployed masses through social  grants,  child  support  grants,
and grants for HIV-affected victims.

To elaborate on a few earmarked developmental undertakings by the  province,
an amount of R1,9 billion has been allocated  to  the  economic  development
and infrastructure cluster. [Time expired.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I will put forward the position of my party.  We
have the chairman of the provincial  finance  committee,  Mr  Van  Rensburg,
here with us today in his new capacity for the first time,  and  we  welcome
him.

It is interesting to note that when we look at the way our  Constitution  is
constructed and at the way the NCOP  is  constructed,  we  can  see  what  a
consensus-seeking device the  NCOP  is.  When  one  considers  that  we  are
dispensing here the lion's share of the South African Budget, then one  sees
the degree  of  consensus  that  exists.  This  is  quite  remarkable  in  a
parliament. This is a product of the Constitution.

May I also say that the Minister's officials  add  to  that  smooth  process
consensus-seeking. They have been  absolutely  excellent.  I  have  had  the
privilege of dealing with them. I phone them  sometimes,  phoning  them  and
urgently asking them to phone back when  they  are  in  the  meetings;  they
phone back on the cellphone and could not  be  more  obliging,  acting  with
humility, with preciseness and with a  high  degree  of  professionalism.  I
want to say that all of us in this House are grateful to them.

I am also heartened by the consensus achieved in the Western Cape as far  as
the  policy  objectives  of  the  provincial  government  and  the   central
Government are concerned. That also is heartening. In my considered  opinion
that is what we should be seeking in this particular budget allocation.

The position with regard to the Division of Revenue Bill this year has  been
much better than last year. The Minister would recall  that  last  year  the
situation was a bit of a jumble, as was the year before.  This  year  things
have gone much more smoothly, partly because of the fact that  the  Minister
published and gazetted the Bill on 6 December. That would  account  for  the
fact that the Minister had a  record  number  of  amendments.  I  think  the
quality of the amendments was very good, with many being  accepted.  I  know
all  of  the  amendments  of  my  province  were  accepted,  after  critical
analysis, both by our committee and by the Minister's Treasury officials.

As a result, I think the Bill was considerably improved  by  the  fact  that
there was a record number of inputs from the provinces  on  improvements  to
the legislation.  That  was  because  the  Bill  was  published  early.  The
difficulty arose, which our chairman has raised here today,  in  that  after
the very good thing of early publishing, we left the hearings too late.

We support the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr H G VAN RENSBURG (Wes-Kaap): Voorsitter, Adjunkminister, kollegas, u  is
bewus dat daar sedert verlede jaar in Desember  baie  verwikkelinge  op  die
politieke landskap in die Wes-Kaap was. Die twee  grootste  partye,  naamlik
die Nuwe NP en  die  ANC,  regeer  saam.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Ek  wil  u  die
versekering gee dat dit goed gaan, en dat dit werk.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Daar
is min spanning, en ons  kan  aandag  gee  aan  ons  werk.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr H G VAN  RENSBURG  (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister  and
colleagues, you are aware of the fact  that  since  last  year  in  December
there have been many developments on the  political  front  in  the  Western
Cape. The two largest parties, namely the New NP and the ANC  are  governing
together. [Interjections.] I want to give you the assurance that  everything
is going well and it is working. [Interjections]. There  is  little  tension
and we can devote our attention to our work.]

As a consequence, I was appointed chairperson of the standing  committee  on
finance and economic development only in January  of  this  year,  by  which
time  the  consultative  process  on  this  Bill,   as   required   by   the
Constitution, had already been concluded. One would therefore accept that  I
am at a distinct disadvantage, in  comparison  to  my  colleagues  from  the
other provinces, who have been through such a process  previously  and  have
taken part in the present round.

However, after a detailed study and analysis of the Bill, I am confident  in
saying that the Division of Revenue Bill for the 2002-03 financial  year  is
a more comprehensive, informative and transparent piece of legislation  when
compared to those of the past.

The explanatory notes attached to the Bill are  especially  informative  and
explain not only the technical aspects of the Bill, but  also  the  division
of revenue in the broader context for which I, in this regard, must  give  a
compliment to the national Treasury.
A fiscal framework that explains the different components of  the  equitable
share formula is also included in the Bill and this  ensures  that  all  the
Bill's readers,  researchers,  laymen  and  other  interested  parties,  are
afforded the opportunity to better understand the total fiscal  envelope  on
which the Bill is based. This, in essence, explains the implicit reason  for
the existence of the division of revenue between and  within  the  different
spheres of government. The early start to the legislative process this  time
around should also be commended.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Sorry,  hon  member,  can  you
take your seat please.

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it right  that  members
converse  so  loudly  while   another   member   is   giving   his   speech?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you,  Mr  Makoela.  I  think
responsible hon members have heard what Mr Makoela has said. If hon  members
could please give the member a chance to speak.

Mr H G VAN RENSBURG: The early start to the legislative  process  this  time
around should also  be  commended  as  provincial  treasuries  were  allowed
sufficient time to submit comments and proposals to the  national  Treasury.
However, I would kindly suggest that sufficient  time  be  allowed  for  the
provincial standing committees and the NCOP to complete their work.

I  must  again  express  my  appreciation  to  the  national  Treasury   for
accommodating  the  Western  Cape's  comments  and  proposals  submitted  in
respect of this Bill. If I may be allowed some  critique,  I  would  suggest
that procedural provisions  that  specifically  deal  with  annual  reports,
financial statements and fruitless and wasteful  expenditure,  as  contained
in clauses 18 and 31 of the Bill, in future only be  taken  up  in  relevant
legislation, such as the Public  Finance  Management  Act  and  in  national
Treasury regulations.

In general, the Western Cape Province and I support the Division of  Revenue
Bill. [Applause.]

Cllr M DIKOKO (Salga): Chairperson, the pronunciation of  Dikoko  should  be
as I have given it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, sir.  I  am  sure
you can appreciate my problem.

Cllr M DIKOKO (Salga): No problem. I just  wanted  to  differentiate  myself
from Eugene de Kock. [Laughter.]

Chairperson of the session, Madam  Chairperson  and  Deputy  Chairperson  in
absentia,  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance,  hon  members,  including  special
delegates, allow me to  bring  greetings  from  our  chairperson  of  Salga,
Father Mkhatshwa.

Salga  is  grateful  for  the  progress  registered  thus  far  towards  the
realisation of our mandate by the piece of legislation which  we  have  been
dealing with. We are not going to be amused,  although  the  chairperson  of
the select committee was saying she was the only  one.  She  was  tasked  to
lead because of the beautiful lady she has brought called Dora.

Given the constitutional obligation of the new local government  regime,  it
is of great necessity that sufficient resources are made available to  local
government if we are to  achieve  the  objectives  of  local  government  as
stated in the Constitution. Currently, and for the foreseeable  future,  the
local government sector is characterised by huge disparities between  metros
with substantial pools of revenue and  resources,  and  district  and  local
councils with insufficient revenue.

The latest statistics show that 80% of our GDP  is  concentrated  among  six
metros, whilst the rest, 20%, is concentrated among 278 municipalities.  The
balance of evidence questions the assertion of the  national  Treasury  that
92% of local government revenue is from own streams. Ideally, the  situation
should be like that, but the prevailing  material  circumstances  suggested,
in the 2001 fiscal review, that the actual figure  ranges  between  37%  and
60% of the nonmetropolitan metros.

Taking into cognisance the magnitude of the legacy of service backlogs  that
still face the country in general, and local government  in  particular,  it
is fair to  assume  that  the  resources  of  many  municipalities  are  not
sufficient to adequately address these backlogs,  especially  in  rural  and
other formerly disadvantaged areas such as our  townships.  The  process  of
urbanisation is also exacerbating the situation.

Of  further  concern  is  the  unquantified  effect  that  the   electricity
restructuring process will  have  on  municipal  finances.  Initial  figures
indicate that up to 32% of municipal revenue is derived  from  the  sale  of
electricity. The manner in which local government will  be  compensated  for
such potential losses still remains unclear.

Now I come to the equitable share  of  the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill.  In
principle, Salga supports the proposed  increase  to  the  local  Government
share, in terms of the MTEF. In the same breath, allow me  to  categorically
state that this form of funding remains inadequate for the stated  purposes,
namely providing basic services to low-income households. In  essence,  this
grant is aimed at stabilising the central administration  and  consolidating
the financial and administrative systems of local government. The  intention
is to afford local government the capacity to respond to  the  call  of  its
constitutional  mandate  by  invoking  the  co-operative   arrangements   as
contemplated in chapter 3.

It is therefore our contention that distinction should be made  between  the
provision of free basic services  and  the  indigent  policies.  Whilst  the
question of indigence is somehow addressed through the  equitable  share  of
the nationally collected revenue, the provision of free  basic  services  is
not addressed. This is the main cause of concern for  local  government,  as
it impacts heavily on the already stretched  and  scarce  resources  of  our
municipalities. It would, therefore, do  a  lot  of  justice  to  the  local
government if this issue could be revisited  and  thoroughly  reviewed  with
the  sole  aim  of  improving  the  quality  of  services  provided  to  our
communities.

The  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Relations  Act  outlines   the   legislative
procedures for  national  division  of  revenue,  and  also  establishes  an
institutional structure  to  facilitate  the  sharing  of  national  revenue
collected. Salga is reiterating its view that given the prominence of  local
government in the delivery of key services  to  the  full  spectrum  of  the
electorate, it must be  represented  in  the  key  intergovernmental  fiscal
structure that the Act established,  such  as  the  Budget  Council.  It  is
therefore critical that there be one structure for all  role-players  across
the  three  spheres  of  Government.  This  would  facilitate  the   crucial
alignment  of  processes,  systems  and  procedures  across  the  governance
spectrum.

The issue of  local  government  capacity  has  been  a  key  focus  of  the
deliberation of this Bill.  Salga  contends  that  the  establishment  of  a
national data base on local government finances is of paramount  importance.
It is clear that national and provincial departments have  capacity-building
strategies for  local  government.  It  is  critically  important  that  all
capacity-building initiatives are co-ordinated so that there  are  concerted
and concentrated efforts to build capacity  in  areas  such  as  management,
infrastructure development and administrative systems as  envisaged  at  the
presidential  co-ordinating  council,  which  Salga  was  part  of,  on   14
December. It is critical that one department spearheads such an  initiative,
and the consolidation of grants is a positive step in that direction.

With regard to the division  of  powers  and  functions  between  local  and
district councils, it is critical that the sustained and  expanded  delivery
of services to all communities be a key determinant in this process. At  the
heart of  the  new  local  government  dispensation  is  the  philosophy  of
developmental local government that enjoins municipalities to be  responsive
to  the  basic  needs  of  their  communities.  The  new  local   Government
legislative regime, which is about to be augmented by the Local  Government:
Municipal Finance Management Act,  laid  the  foundation  for  developmental
nodes.

The allocation of powers and functions between local and  district  councils
must further the aims of developmental government, and,  consequently,  such
allocations shall maximise the potential for local level redistribution.  It
is against this background that the  division  of  these  functions  between
these two spheres of Government must be understood.

Finally, let me reiterate the support and commitment of Salga  to  effective
participation in this House and in all its committees. We will  engage  with
the Chairperson's office and all other relevant structures of Parliament  on
co-operative strategies,  to  further  enhance  our  participation  for  the
benefit of our democracy as a whole and for local government in  particular.
[Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, hon  Deputy  Minister  and  hon  members,  it  is
honestly not my  intention  to  take  much  time  this  afternoon  precisely
because, as hon members know, they have indeed covered the kind of  work  we
needed to do this afternoon in much greater detail.

But, I think I will be failing in  my  duty  if  I  do  not  raise,  in  the
presence of the Deputy Minister, the kind of  concerns  that  we  have  been
raising as  Mpumalanga  for  the  past  two  years.  One  of  the  concerns,
obviously, relates to the issue of the  kind  of  statistics  we  have  been
using in determining the allocation of  nationally  collected  revenue.  The
1996 statistics,  for  instance,  have  actually  adversely  affected  funds
allocated to Mpumalanga.

The point I am raising relates to the influx of illegal immigrants from  our
neighbouring countries.  This,  as  I  have  pointed  out  earlier  on,  has
adversely affected the allocation of  the  said  resources.  The  statistics
used as a basis for allocations  do  not  capture  the  movement  of  people
across national boundaries into Mpumalanga.  The  end  result  obviously  is
that those people then apply for our housing subsidies, attend our  schools,
access pensions for the elderly, take advantage of the child support  grants
and access many other services, which our people from  our  province  should
be accessing. It would be appreciated if some relief for movement of  people
could be factored into the formula  used  to  determine  the  allocation  of
nationally collected revenue.

With regard to our provincial budget for the financial year commencing on  1
April 2002, we as Mpumalanga are pleased to announce before this House  this
afternoon that a substantial chunk of the allocation for this year  went  to
education, which was basically 41%.  That  is  in  line  with  the  national
commitment by Government to  increase  the  learning  opportunities  of  our
youth. As a province we have taken our cue from national Government, and  we
have gone further to ensure that we are able to  give  priority  to  poverty
alleviation programmes. We have announced in the province, in  this  regard,
that we have allocated 23% of the total share  of  the  province  to  social
services in in order to begin to deal with the issues I raised earlier.

One of the issues we felt we needed  to  address  as  a  matter  of  extreme
urgency as a province relates to the issue of security for  our  communities
- the problem of people crossing our boundaries. Much  more  has  also  been
allocated in the area of safety and security.

I think it is important to raise again a few issues that  were  raised  very
sharply by the FFC during the public  hearings.  I  think  the  point  about
conditional  grants   being   limited   and   that   they   should   promote
constitutional  intentions  with  respect  to   decentralisation   and   the
principle of good governance applicable  to  subnational  governance,  is  a
matter we should take to heart, all of us as legislatures.

An issue was also raised in relation to the element  of  accountability  for
conditional grants  that  are  shared  among  national  Government  and  its
recipient governments in the sense that they remain  part  of  the  national
equitable share for  which  national  Government  is  accountable.  In  this
respect, the Financial and Fiscal Commission again emphasised in the  public
hearings the need for Government to develop norms  and  standards  of  basic
service delivery.

It was further argued that conditional  grants  represent  the  revenue  for
receiving provincial and  local  government  and,  as  such,  the  receiving
subnational governments are accountable for delivery on national  priorities
given the norms and standards where the equitable  share  is  not  achieving
such priorities.

The area, again, which I feel I should talk about relates  to  the  area  of
special allocation grants. These grants have been used to  address  national
priority areas,  such  as  poverty  and  the  HIV/Aids  epidemic.  Initially
allocations were decided outside of the Budget process with the result  that
funds were disbursed late,  resulting  in  underspending.  This  matter  was
raised very sharply in the public  hearings,  and  we  hope  that  something
practical is going to be done to address this area.

Other issues to which I feel the House's attention has to  be  drawn  relate
to what the national Treasury has  done,  and  what  we  propose  it  should
consider doing in the foreseeable future. While strides have  been  made  by
the  national  Treasury  in  working  with  municipalities  and   provincial
governments  to  meet  their  developmental  goals  as  set   out   in   the
Constitution, we have agreed and still agree that enormous challenges  still
remain and ought to be tackled head  on.  These  challenges  include,  inter
alia, the completion of the process to fully transform local  government  as
a sphere of government, and that we need a more supportive system  for  both
provinces and local government to enhance their capacities to spend,  manage
and implement policies.

We as Mpumalanga support this Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson,  first  and  foremost  I  would
like to thank all the members  not  only  for  their  participation  in  the
debate, but also for their overwhelming support for the Division of  Revenue
Bill. I think that says a lot about our  evolving  intergovernmental  fiscal
system in that we are able to have this degree  of  consensus,  as  the  hon
Kent Durr indicated in his own remarks.

I would like to  thank  the  chairperson  for  raising  issues  particularly
around socioeconomic rights, because I think our budgets count  for  nothing
if they do not become relevant to the lives of our people. I think  that  at
all times we must be able to measure what we do through,  for  example,  our
budgets, and also  through  other  legislation  that  is  contained  in  the
Constitution and our policy as a Government. I really would  like  to  thank
the chairperson for raising socioeconomic rights, and especially that  March
is Human Rights month.

I would also like to thank the hon Theron  from  Gauteng,  or  from  the  DA
rather ... [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, please!

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Will this argument, Chair, save some of my  minutes?  I
would like to thank the hon Theron for the analysis  that  he  gave  of  the
Division of Revenue Bill. He raised  quite  a  number  of  issues.  The  hon
member from KwaZulu-Natal raised quite a number  of  issues,  and  I  think,
perhaps in response to those issues, I need to say  that  this  is  why  one
sees with this particular Budget that the largest increase is  the  increase
that is being given to local government.

I would like to draw the attention of the member to page 167 of  the  Budget
Review which actually details a lot of the grants that are  aimed  at  local
government and whose objective is to achieve precisely the issues  that  the
member  was  indicating  -  issues   around   capacity-building,   financial
management and the restructuring process itself. So we have a very  specific
table in the review, Table 7.8, which  details  all  of  the  transfers  and
grants that go to the local government. I would just like to say  that  many
of them are really intended to support local government, so as  to  be  able
to do the things that the member was talking about.

On the issue of the  Rural  Development  Programme  and  the  Urban  Renewal
Strategy, it is important for members  to  recognise  that  this  is  a  new
culture in Government. This culture has never  before  existed.  Departments
have never pooled their resources, planned  together  and  worked  together.
This is a culture, but, in addition to that, one of the things  that  became
quite clear to us as Government, as we sought to  move  in  this  integrated
fashion, was that there is a certain type of skill that was lacking  in  the
Public Service, the kind of skill to manage  cross-cutting  programmes,  the
project management type of skill. But these  are  all  issues  that  we  are
alive to and in a number of these nodes, rural and urban nodes, there  is  a
lot of progress that has been made, as one of the members from the  Northern
Cape indicated.

On the R293 issue, I think a few years ago we did make a proposal on how  to
migrate from a situation in which we perpetually have  people  who  are  so-
called R293 people, and how we would deal with that issue both in  terms  of
provincial and local government. Perhaps it will be  important  to  look  at
what the state of play is in that particular regard. However, what  we  have
not sought to do is to foist the R293  stuff  onto  local  governments  that
could not take over those responsibilities.

Indeed, viva Northern Cape, although the Gauteng people say there  are  only
1  000  people  there,  so  they  can  build  their  houses  quite  quickly.
[Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Again I would like to thank the member from Limpopo, who  really  has  tried
to show us just what the change has been since the advent of democracy,  and
we indeed appreciate that.

Regarding the comments made by the hon member Mr  Durr  on  the  service  he
received from the officials of the department, that is the  kind  of  public
service that we want our officials to render to the public. I think this  is
what Batho Pele should be about. It should be  about  the  kind  of  service
that our officials give. I do want to say that in many instances, we in  the
national Treasury in particular, are especially  proud  of  the  quality  of
people that we have, the quality of service  that  they  render,  and  their
professionalism, their dedication and commitment to the work.

With regard to the issue around the amendments reflecting the fact  that  we
gazetted the draft Division of Revenue Bill in December and that the  volume
of the amendments probably reflects that, this goes back to the  point  that
I made earlier on that perhaps Parliament does need to  take  note  of  that
and make adjustments accordingly, because members must  understand  that  we
are engaged in a whole process. For example, we cannot publish  the  Medium-
Term Budget Policy Statement earlier than we do, part of  the  reason  being
that we utilise some of the data that comes from the Reserve Bank, and  this
only comes with the third quarter's bulletin, which comes out at the end  of
September. And so, it is important for us  to  utilise  that  data,  because
certain of  the  projections  that  we  make  are  based  on  some  of  that
information.

Therefore, this is a whole chain of interconnected events, because even  for
the Division of Revenue Bill to make sense we  need  to  have  made  certain
determinations in the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement which  must  await
the third quarterly bulletin of the SA  Reserve  Bank.  I  think  Parliament
does need to look at this issue and see how best it can engage with  it,  so
that we can indeed avoid the situation that the member  spoke  about.  I  do
accept, though, that Parliament has an important role to play in  improving,
through  amendments,  legislation  that  the  executive   has   tabled   for
Parliament. I do accept that point.

An issue raised by a member here concerned ensuring that municipalities  are
advised well in advance of their financial year of the equitable  share  and
other allocations. We recognise this, but we have  decided  to  move  fairly
cautiously on this, bearing in mind that the  transformation  of  the  local
sphere  of  government  is  an  involved  process  in  that  we  should,  in
determining  each  municipality's  share,  take  into  account  its   fiscal
capacity with a view to the prioritisation of the funding of  municipalities
for basic service delivery. The division per municipality is expected to  be
announced in the Gazette by 15 April.

With reference to the issues raised by the member from the Western Cape,  we
are indeed happy to hear that the coalition is working in the Western  Cape.
[Applause.] I think  it  confirms  the  old  saying  that  there  is  always
something new coming out of Africa,  and  I  think  this  is  one  of  them.
[Interjections.] The comment the member made to the effect  that  provisions
dealing with  the  financial  management  of  allocations  provided  in  the
Division of Revenue Bill should be  dealt  with  in  legislation  regulating
public financial management is something we have  taken  note  of  and  with
which we agree. The Treasury is attending to the amendment of  the  PFMA  in
order to codify those sorts of issues, and we will take a  similar  approach
with respect to local government when the Municipal Finance  Management  Act
is in place.
Finally, on issues raised by the representative from Salga,  who  criticised
the viewpoint of national Treasury that 92% of revenue is  raised  at  local
government level and  who  contrasted  that  with  the  fact  that  a  large
percentage of the budgets of local government as a whole really reside in  a
few metros. That is a point that is well taken, but  I  think  we  must  not
counterpose the two, because the fact of a large portion of the  expenditure
being in  a  few  metros  does  not  automatically  translate  into  smaller
municipalities being unable to raise revenue. I just want  to  say  on  this
point that there are a number of measures that we have to  take  in  dealing
with the issues of local government revenue.

Yes, from national Government's side, we  are  rendering  quite  significant
support to local authorities, particularly those that  do  not  have  fiscal
capacity. But that is not all that has to be done. In other words,  this  is
not only a case of pumping in money. There are other issues that need to  be
addressed. The  issues  around  effective  collection  of  revenue  that  is
available at a particular municipality  need  to  be  addressed.  There  are
issues of capacity-building that need to be attended to.

We have to approach these issues in that sort of holistic  fashion  and  not
think that the only issue is increasing the amount of resources that  go  to
local government, while we do not attend to  other  issues  that  also  need
attention. Indeed, it may well be the case that we still  need  to  beef  up
support  with  regard  to  certain  municipalities.   Let   us   take   into
consideration the whole variety of issues that need to be attended to.

On the point raised by the hon Taabe on statistics, firstly I  would  simply
want to say  that  statistics  do  not  become  wrong  simply  because  they
disadvantage an allocation to a particular province. However, I do take  the
point that he  is  raising  about  the  flow  of  people  from  neighbouring
countries. I want the hon member to take note that if we were  to  take  the
census that was  done  in  2001,  it  did  not  discriminate  between  South
Africans and non-South Africans. It was a general census that wanted to  get
a sense of the number of people in the country, because through that one  is
able to determine the level of services that need to be rendered.

The second point I would like to make is that in making  decisions  we  have
to base ourselves on  something.  And  so  the  best  information  that  was
available to us was the 1996 census. By the way, that set of data that  came
up with that census is the best South Africa has had since the  last  proper
census that was done in about 1969/1970.  That  was  when  a  real  national
census was last done in South Africa, because thereafter, the country  broke
up into a whole number of entities. Therefore, we have to base ourselves  on
the best available information, and make judgments,  of  course  in  certain
regards, as we make these sorts of decisions.

I really would like to thank all members for both  their  participation  and
their enthusiastic support for the Division of Revenue Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr T  B  TAABE:  Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister,  hon  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, as hon members of the  House  know,  the  Unemployment  Insurance
Contributions Bill of 2001 principally seeks to address the  high  level  of
employer default and noncompliance by proposing the introduction of  tougher
penalties and  fines  on  those  employers  who  fail  to  comply  with  the
requirements of the Bill.

These measures are further strengthened by the proposals to  bring  the  UIF
collection regime under the  ambit  of  the  functions  of  the  SA  Revenue
Service and its enabling legislation, the Income Tax Act, Act  58  of  1962.
Further, the Bill proposes wide-ranging  measures  that  fundamentally  deal
with  aspects  of  noncompliance  such  as  underdisclosure  of   employees'
earnings, nonpayment and misrepresentations.  This  will  ensure  that  both
employers and employees will not engage in fraudulent  activities  and  will
greatly enhance the  capacity  of  the  authorities  to  prosecute  in  this
regard.

An electronic contributor database  containing  contribution  records  will,
for the first time,  be  made  available,  thus  obviating  and  effectively
eliminating  corruption-prone  paper-based   operations.   It   is   further
encouraging to note that the employers will be  required  by  law,  for  the
first time, to submit declarations listing  those  in  their  employ,  their
income and all other relevant information as may be required.

On the financial side, it is pleasing to note that the  director-general  is
deemed to be the accounting authority of the fund for the  purpose  of  this
legislation in terms of the Public Finance Management Act.

Concerns have  been  raised  about  the  possibility  of  a  sharp  increase
relating  to  the  Revenue  Service's  staff.  This  will  be  addressed  by
transferring staff from the UIF who deal directly with contributions to  the
Revenue Service for that purpose.

As a committee we are acutely aware and quite  happy  that  consultation  on
this  legislation  was  indeed  quite  sufficient  and  very  thorough.   We
accordingly support this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

       COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL PERFORMERS' PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I have been informed that  the  Whippery
have agreed that there should be one debate for the third and fourth  Orders
of the Day.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  I  must  say  I  am  very
pleased that both the NA  and  NCOP  will  not  earn  needle  time  for  the
debates.

I  think  within  the  framework  of   Government   policy   on   protecting
intellectual property and complying with our international  obligations,  we
are also achieving modernisation and introducing aspects to  this  important
area which will benefit our people.

These two Bills and the amendments  in  them  are  essentially  designed  to
introduce the concept that performers have certain  rights  and  can  accrue
certain income from the playing of their performances subsequently. This  is
an important breakthrough. To do this, and precisely  because  there  is  an
imbalance of power between performers, who are often  individuals,  and  the
more  powerful  institutions  that  use  their  performances,   broadcasting
stations and  record  companies,  we  are  also  establishing  the  idea  of
collecting societies, which is the  coming  together,  or  ability  to  come
together, to ensure that these royalties  can  be  collected.  We  are  also
introducing interesting ideas and correct  ideas  that  traditional  dancers
also be regarded as performers.

Another aspect of this which I believe is important is that  this  is  in  a
sense a further step towards  empowering  the  micro  enterprise  and  small
income earner, because many performers are in essence that. It will help  to
empower people as our society changes. We are  already  seeing  performances
by black persons becoming more and more prominent, as our society becomes  a
more  normal  society.  It  is  important  that  we  regulate  this  process
carefully.  It  does  raise  new   and   relatively   difficult   commercial
transactions, so that the regulations that  come  out  subsequent  to  these
Bills becoming Acts will set up very clearly the collecting societies,  will
deal also with the obligations they have  to  report  to  the  administering
body, which is the Companies and  Intellectual  Property  Office,  and  will
ensure that mechanisms for dispute settlement are clearly spelt out.
I believe, therefore, that these  two  amendments  are  very  important  new
contributions  to  the  whole  arena  of  intellectual  property   and   are
establishing greater equity in the process by  allowing  performers  certain
income rights. I would like to thank  the  select  committee  for  proposing
further changes. These changes are, in essence, correct and  hopefully  will
be supported by both Houses. I would urge the House  to  support  these  two
amendments. I think it is an exciting new aspect  of  intellectual  property
law. [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I am being  intimidated  from  all  sides  to  be
brief. You must protect me, Chairperson,  because  I  think  that  something
needs to be said today about the legislation that we are dealing with.  When
we pass laws in Parliament, usually what happens is that there  is  a  human
side which deals with the human spirit,  the  very  essence  of  humanity  -
whether it is education, health or whatever else. There is  also  the  legal
side, the fact that we make laws to govern society. There is  no  Bill  that
better describes those two areas than the ones before us today.
What these Bills do is to propose a  whole  lot  of  legal  processes  which
protect the copyright, and so forth, of performers, who  are  in  many  ways
the lifeblood of most societies. The Minister dealt with that legal side.  I
just want to tell the House a little bit about the human side,  things  that
we all know about, but about which we have  been  wondering  when  something
was going to be done. This Bill is doing something about those  things  that
we all know about.

Hon members will remember the song from The Lion King,  the  one  that  kids
and adults know, etc. [Interjections.] The person who wrote  that  song  and
the people who performed it are  indigenous  South  Africans,  people  whose
music and art became known all over the world. The lyrics of that  song  are
on the lips and tongues of billions of people across the  globe,  young  and
old.

The person who composed that song died a pauper - a poor person. He died  so
poor that he could not even educate his own kids properly. Hon members  will
remember other people who were not acknowledged for the  great  things  they
did, such as Enoch Sontonga, who wrote the  national  anthem  that  we  sing
here in this country, which is, in fact, the national anthem of the  African
continent. The spirit of our continent, society  and  people  has  not  been
adequately recognised,  mostly  because,  art,  culture,  etc,  have  to  be
married to a livelihood, so that one can have  a  plate  of  food  on  one's
table and so that one can think about one's poetry, art, culture and  music.
Most of these performers have not been paid for  the  work  they  have  done
over the years, and still do not get paid for the work that they do.

This has been a bone of contention and has been raised with the Ministry  of
Trade and Industry many times, and the Minister, as he has indicated to  hon
members, has taken the matter seriously and has done something about it.  He
is responding to the call of our athletes and performers out there. We  want
to congratulate the Minister for having taken this step. It is  a  very  big
step towards lifting  the  spirit  of  our  people,  that  which  keeps  the
creativity in our society alive.
This Bill is  going  to  require  that  anybody  who  plays  the  music  and
communicates the creativity of any other person must pay for  it.  When  one
listens to the radio and hears a nice song, somebody must get paid for  that
song being played. It must not only be the rich fat cat who has  bought  the
song from the poor  performer  and  who  keeps  the  poor  artist  and  poor
performer from producing these things that gets paid, but also those  people
who perform and write songs. That is what  this  Bill  is  about  in  simple
terms.

This Bill is creating a regime in this country that is going to respect  the
copyright of people who have creativity. It is going  to  require,  by  law,
that those people are paid when their creativity is used by others,  whether
in this country or anywhere else in the world. It is going to  require  that
tribunals be set  up  and  that  other  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  and
arbitrations, etc take place  if  performers  do  not  get  paid  for  their
creativity and the work they do.

There are also obligations that come with passing a law  like  this.  If  we
utilise the creativity of people in other countries, we  will  have  to  pay
them, even if they are from across our borders.  It  is  good,  I  am  sure,
because hon members know that now that South Africa has become  a  very  big
part of the continent of Africa, we are  experiencing  African  music  every
day. If one is listening to the radio, one hears  it.  In  fact,  even  this
weekend in Cape Town there are going to be African  artists  from  all  over
the world playing here - Khadja Nin and all sorts of  people.  Those  people
have to be paid royalties if their music is played on  our  radio  stations.
So, we have to pay some money to people outside our borders because of  this
law, but it is a good law. It is something that is necessary  and  something
we had to do. We are proud of the Ministry  and  want  to  congratulate  the
Minister for having taken this step.

I want to call on this House to fully endorse and support this  legislation.
I think that it makes us a better country and a better society.  [Applause.]


Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I will be very brief.

Sedert  1995  het  betrokkenes  ernstig  gedebatteer  oor  die  tantieme  of
``royalties'' van uitvoerende  kunstenaars.  Dit  is  wyd  gerapporteer  dat
kunstenaars nie hulle regverdige aandeel van die tantieme  verkry  nie.  Die
huidige situasie is dat die opnamemaatskappye se  onderhandelingsposisie  te
sterk is in die huidige stelsel en sodoende  kunstenaars  benadeel.  Dit  is
dus baie belangrik dat die regte van uitvoerende kunstenaars  beter  beskerm
sal word deur wetgewing in Suid-Afrika.

Die doelwit van die amendemente op die Wysigingswetsontwerp op  Kopiereg  en
die Wetsontwerp op die Beskerming van Kunstenaars is om 'n begin te maak  om
die talle aspekte aan te spreek wat betref die  insameling  en  verspreiding
van tantieme en om ewewig te bring in die monetêre  en  magsongelykhede  wat
in die bedryf bestaan. Uit  die  besprekings  wat  plaasgevind  het  in  die
komitee is dit duidelik dat die staat 'n rol het om te vervul.  'n  Raamwerk
moet geskep word om die  regte  van  al  die  betrokkenes  te  beskerm.  Die
huidige situasie is ongelyk en moet reggestel word.

Die toetrede van die Departement van Handel en Nywerheid  sal  help  om  die
belange van die partye in die industrie op 'n meer gelyke basis te  beskerm.
Meeste van die rolspelers in die industrie het  hul  steun  uitgespreek  vir
die wetsontwerp in die  voorleggings  wat  gemaak  is.  Die  DA  is  daarvan
oortuig dat hierdie wetsontwerpe 'n positiewe bydrae tot die  industrie  sal
maak en steun dus albei hierdie twee wetsontwerpe.  [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Since 1995 stakeholders have been seriously debating about  the  percentage
of royalties of performing artists. It was widely reported that artists  did
not receive their fair share of the  royalties.  The  current  situation  is
that recording companies have too  strong  a  negotiation  position  in  the
present system and, in this way artists are  prejudiced.  Therefore,  it  is
very important that the rights of performing artists  are  better  protected
by legislation in South Africa.
The objective of the amendments to the  Copyright  Amendment  Bill  and  the
Performers' Protection  Amendment  Bill  is  to  start  addressing  all  the
aspects relating to the collection and  distribution  of  royalties  and  to
achieve a balance in the monetary and power inequalities that exist  in  the
industry. From the discussions that took place in the committee it is  clear
that the state has a role to play. A framework must be created in  order  to
protect the rights  of  all  the  stakeholders.  The  current  situation  is
unequal and must be rectified.

The intervention of the Department of Trade  and  Industry  will  assist  to
protect the interests of the parties and the industry on a much  more  equal
basis. Most of  the  role-players  in  the  industry  have  expressed  their
support for the Bill in the submissions that were made. The DA is  convinced
that these Bills will make a positive  contribution  to  the  industry  and,
therefore, supports both these Bills. [Applause.]]

Dr E A CONROY:  Chairperson,  Minister  Erwin  and  colleagues,  any  worker
should be entitled to enjoy the fruit of their efforts. The Bible says  that
men and women shall eat their daily bread with  the  sweat  of  their  daily
toils on their brows. This does not only  mean  that  a  person  should  not
expect to eat if he or she does not make an effort, but it also  means  that
if one makes an honest effort, one should also  be  entitled  to  enjoy  the
fruit of one's efforts.

These efforts may be in the form of the financial capital when  one  invests
something, or the physical work one invests in or the  intellectual  capital
or effort one invests. What one has invested  belongs  to  one,  unless  one
sells it to someone else. Intellectual capital is that  which  one  produces
and brings forth with one's talent or intellectual  capacity  or  mind  when
one designs, writes or composes something. One does not necessarily have  to
produce something physical or tangible with one's hands to be productive.

If one produces a song with one's voice or plays something on the  piano  or
another musical instrument, that will  be  part  of  one's  intellectual  or
talent capital which one applies for one's good to make a living.

Die huidige bedingingsmilieu sien  nie  voldoende  om  na  die  belange  van
kunstenaars nie, veral  nie  vir  sover  dit  die  persentasieverdeling  vir
inkomste tussen kunstenaars en die opnamemaatskappye betref nie. Hierdie  is
egter 'n saak wat lank reeds ook in die publieke  domein  gedebatteer  word.
Gevalle is bekend waar veral swart kunstenaars oorlede is, sonder dat  hulle
ooit 'n sent gesien het  van  die  inkomste  wat  deur  hulle  intellektuele
vermoëns voortgebring is.

In dié stadium dink ek kollega Moosa het tien teen een my toespraak te  lese
gekry voor die tyd. Daar word in hierdie opsig veral  gedink  aan  die  lied
wat onlangs in die Disneyfilm The Lion King gebruik is en tot 'n groot  mate
tot die wêreldwye  loketsukses  daarvan  bygedra  het.  Die  Suid-Afrikaanse
skepper van die lied is egter lank reeds oorlede en nie eens sy nasate  blyk
enige inkomste uit sy intellektuele eiendom te verdien nie.

Daar word  met  hierdie  onderling  verbandhoudende  wetsontwerpe  wat  hier
gedebatteer word, gepoog om 'n verskeidenheid onderwerpe oor die  insameling
en verdeling van tantieme aan te  spreek  en  die  vele  wanbalanse  in  die
bedryf  reg  te  stel.  Die  algemene  en   oorhoofse   doel   van   hierdie
wysigingswetsontwerpe  is  om  praktyke  wat   Suid-Afrikaanse   kunstenaars
uitbuit, te voorkom en 'n gelyke speelveld vir alle deelnemers daar te  stel
-  en  was  lank  reeds  nodig.  Die  Nuwe  NP  steun  albei   wetsontwerpe.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The current bargaining environment does not  pay  sufficient  attention  to
the interests of artists, in particular when  it  comes  to  the  percentage
split in earnings between artists and the recording companies.  This  is  an
issue, however, which has for some time been debated in  the  public  domain
as well. There are known cases where mainly black artists have  passed  away
without ever  having  seen  a  cent  of  the  earnings  generated  by  their
intellectual abilities.

At this stage I think that colleague Moosa has probably had insight into  my
speech before the time. In this regard one thinks especially about the  song
that was recently used in the Disney film The  Lion  King  and  which  to  a
large extent contributed to its  worldwide  box-office  success.  The  South
African creator of this song has long since passed away  and  evidently  not
even his descendants have earned any income from his intellectual  property.


The interrelated Bills now under discussion  seek  to  address  a  range  of
issues regarding the netting and sharing of  royalties  and  to  remedy  the
many imbalances in the industry.  The  general  and  overall  aim  of  these
amending Bills is to prevent practices that exploit  South  African  artists
and to establish a level playing field for  all  participants  -  which  has
been necessary for a long time. The New NP supports both Bills.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I want to start by saying I  think  the  hon  Mr
Moosa has actually described very clearly and very succinctly the nature  of
the amendments before this House. But I just want to take Mr  Moosa's  point
a bit further. These amendments herald a  new  beginning  in  the  lives  of
performers in this country.

For the first time our performers will be  protected  from  exploitation  by
the recording companies. They have  been  exploited  for  decades,  and  hon
members will appreciate that the beauty of the African voices  has  enriched
many of European  singers,  such  as  Elvis  Presley  and  Paul  Simon.  For
example, Elvis Presley's song I can't Help  Falling  in  Love  was  enriched
with the lyrics of a song by  Solomon  Cele,  who  was  popularly  known  as
Solomon Linda, from his ever famous song Imbube.  They  took  the  tune  and
wrote English lyrics to it and turned it into  an  immortal  hit  for  Elvis
Presley.

African voices have created millionaires in our  music  recording  industry,
but our performers have actually died in abject  poverty.  The  song  Imbube
was recorded in 1939 and it was turned into a hit pop single  recorded  more
than a hundred times by musicians the  world  over.  It  is  estimated  that
overseas the song,  which  was  rearranged  and  rerecorded  in  an  English
version as The Lion Sleeps Tonight made in excess of  US  $200  million  and
Solomon got - hon members can guess? - only R170 000, and he died a pauper.

Take, for instance, the example of Simon Nkabinde, who was  popularly  known
as Mahlathini, the voice of the  bull.  He  had  an  amazing,  awe-inspiring
voice that  developed  into  full  power  and  majesty.  He  sang  with  the
Mahotella Queens. His famous  song  was  Sengikhala  ngiyabaleka.  But  what
happened to him? He died a pauper. There are many others  such  as  Margaret
Singana, Zakes Nkosi,  Thomas  Ndaba,  David  Sello,  Alpheus  Nkosi,  Selby
Ntuli, West Nkosi,  Marks  Mankwane  and  Joseph  Makwela.  There  are  many
others. They were all robbed by the recording  companies  -  I  nearly  used
another word - of their royalties, and they  all  died  in  abject  poverty.
Their lawyers tried in vain.

These are the reasons that compel us, today, in the spirit of what  the  hon
Mr Moosa has said, to support  and  embrace  these  amendments  before  this
House. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Madam  Chair,  there  is  no  doubt  that  there  is  general
agreement that the formation of regulated collecting societies will  enhance
the  revenue  stream  of  South  African  musicians  and   performers.   The
electronic revolution now makes it possible  to  collect  revenue  in  small
fractions and the software exists for this to happen.  Previously  this  was
impossible - technically it could not be done - but it can be done now,  and
it is good that we are doing it now.

The reality is that these measures do much to foster the performing arts  as
many who create music often find it difficult to capitalise or benefit  from
their creativity. The Copyright Amendment Bill focuses on the collection  of
fees and the Performers' Protection Amendment Bill  on  the  currently  weak
bargaining position of the performer. That is very important. This  is  done
by  introducing   collective   bargaining   in   order   to   equalise   the
disproportionate  power  relationships  between  performers  and  large   TV
stations and radio networks, thereby levelling  the  playing  field  between
the consumers and producers and distributors.

We favour the Bill, as the ACDP, because it is an  enabling  Bill,  and  the
private sector will create its own apparatus to self-regulate in order  that
individuals may receive their just rewards for artistic endeavour. The  Bill
brings us into line with practice in other jurisdictions. What  we  need  is
to seek reciprocity with other countries where they respect  the  rights  of
our artists, so that we then respect the rights  of  their  artists.  If  we
seek reciprocity, we will, in other words,  honour  the  rights  of  artists
from countries where  they  honour  the  rights  of  our  artists.  I  think
reciprocity is a basic tenet.

With that suggestion may I say that we not only support  the  Bill,  but  we
acclaim it and we congratulate the Minister. [Applause.]

[Ms  M  P  THEMBA:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, the intention of these amendments is to  address  the  issues  of
conferring and paying of royalties  to  copyright  owners  in  an  equitable
manner and to try and redress the financial and power imbalances that  exist
in the current legislation regarding the industry.

The Copyright Amendment Bill amends the principal Act which leaves out  many
aspects of the industry which it should deal  with.  Since  1995  there  has
been a huge debate as  to  whether  the  royalties  accrued  from  recording
rights of performing artists should be paid to performers.

The objective of the principal Act's focus was  mainly  to  look  after  the
interests of recording companies, and it put more emphasis on the rights  of
broadcasters at the expense of the rights of performing artists.

My colleagues have already raised many of the  issues  I  wanted  to  raise,
therefore I do not wish  to  spoil  their  good  work.  I  support  the  two
amending Bills. [Applause.]]

UMPHATHISIHLALO  WOMKHANDLU  WEZIFUNDAZWE  KAZWELONKE:  Ngiyabonga  kakhulu.
Ngiyabona ukuthi ngoba awusakhulumi ulimi lwasekhaya, usulokhu  uwa  mawuthi
uzama ukulukhuluma. Sizocela - ke ukuthi ulukhulume kakhulu, ukuze ungawi.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you, Chairperson of  the  NCOP.  I
can see that you are no longer speaking your home language now.  You  always
stumble when you try to speak it. We would ask you to speak loudly  so  that
you will not stumble.]

Chairperson, you will be relieved to know  that  I  will  not  use  my  full
recording time. I would like to thank  the  members  for  their  support.  I
think this is an exciting and important Bill. I am also  quite  prepared  to
arbitrate between Dr Conroy and Mr Moosa as to who  actually  had  copyright
to the story about the Lion King. I am pleased to see that  the  hon  member
Bhengu had a much wider repertoire of stories to tell, so I do not  have  to
deal with a copyright dispute between three parties, but  just  one  between
two parties.

I really do think that this is an exciting day. One of the  challenges  that
will face us in the Department of Trade in Industry, and we are  working  on
it, is to make this right known to performers. What the  hon  member  Bhengu
spoke about was some of our real history. When we think  of  those  persons,
we realise that this was very much part of our culture,  and  it  was  lost.
From now on, as  we  develop  more  and  more  performers  of  international
quality, it will also help put income back into our  communities  in  a  way
that will stabilise our society.

One of the great strengths of our society, of our country, is  its  cultural
richness  and  its  ability  to  translate  that  into  the  most  wonderful
performances of every type. As my  colleague  Mr  Moosa  said,  this  is  an
exciting day. We have been  able  to  put  together  some  very  complicated
technical laws in  a  way  that  will  help  people  to  be  better  people.
[Applause.]

                             ANIMAL HEALTH BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon members, this Bill comes before  this  House
for the second time owing to the fact that it was referred to  the  National
Assembly and there were minor changes.

The Bill seeks to provide for the control of animal diseases and  parasites.
We understand the importance this Bill holds for animals  in  ensuring  that
they will have the best protection against fatal diseases that  could  quite
possibly eliminate them. We are also aware of  the  consumers'  need  to  be
assured that the animal products they consume on  a  daily  basis  are  safe
from contamination. This Bill offers us this assurance.

We are very aware of the vast range of control measures that  is  needed  to
contain the outbreak of disease, such as  foot-and-mouth  disease.  We  have
seen at first hand the effect the disease has had  on  the  farmer,  on  the
community, on the province and on our country. We  all  read  with  mounting
concern every new report of an outbreak of the  disease  as  it  moved  from
farm to farm.

We watched anxiously as the Government department  moved  in  to  quarantine
the area and restrict the movement of livestock,  pedestrians  and  vehicles
in their efforts to contain the disease. We  felt  the  pain  of  those  who
watched while hundreds of herds of cattle and other livestock  were  removed
and burned.

Today we realise that even after we brought the  disease  under  control  in
provinces like KwaZulu-Natal, South African beef  products  still  have  not
overcome some of the international scepticism since the disease first  broke
out. As a nation we need to demonstrate emphatically  to  the  international
community that we not only overcame our animal health problems quickly,  but
that we contained and limited the disease to the  area  where  the  outbreak
was first reported. I believe that we did this  more  than  adequately,  but
unfortunately the international community is not convinced.

This Bill demonstrates South Africa's serious approach to animal  health  by
incorporating all the lessons learned from current events to the  events  of
the more  distant  past.  The  Bill  incorporates  public  views  and  other
stakeholders' views on crucial issues such as  compensation  for  those  who
stand to lose their livelihood because of steps taken by the  Government  to
quarantine farms and destroy infected animals.

The Bill also retains vital components of  the  1984  Animal  Diseases  Act,
such as the continued incorporation of  international  norms  and  standards
for disease-control measures and the establishment of  quarantine  stations,
among other things.
An important innovation contained in this new Bill is  that  the  export  of
animals and animal products will now be controlled in order to  protect  the
animal health status of the importing country. There  are  powers  governing
entry and investigations  may  be  conducted  without  the  authority  of  a
warrant under certain circumstances. This especially enables  officials  who
follow the trail of stock thieves to their destinations to catch  them  red-
handed.

Finally, our committee has carefully examined the contents of this Bill  and
we are satisfied that it will demonstrate our seriousness in  the  promotion
of animal health and of combating and controlling  of  animal  diseases.  We
therefore endorse this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 19:08.

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:


     (1)     The  following  Bill  was  introduced  by   the   Minister   of
         Communications in  the  National  Assembly  on  5  March  2002  and
         referred to the Joint Tagging Mechanism  (JTM)  for  classification
         in terms of Joint Rule 160:


         (i)     Electronic Communications and  Transactions  Bill  [B  8  -
              2002] (National Assembly - sec 75) [Bill and prior  notice  of
              its introduction published in Government Gazette No 23195 of 1
              March 2002.]


         The  Bill  has  been  referred  to  the  Portfolio   Committee   on
         Communications of the National Assembly.


         In terms of Joint Rule 154 written views on the  classification  of
         the Bill may be submitted to the  JTM  within  three  parliamentary
         working days.


     (2)    On 5 March 2002 the Joint Tagging Mechanism (JTM), in  terms  of
         Joint  Rule  160,  classified  the  following   Bill,   which   was
         introduced as a section 76 Bill, as a section 75 Bill:


         (i)     Disestablishment of South  African  Housing  Trust  Limited
              Bill [B 3 - 2002].


              In terms of Joint Rule 160(4), the JTM finds that the Bill:


              (a) is not a section 76 Bill;


              (b) includes no provision to which the procedure prescribed in
                  section 76 of the Constitution applies;


              (c) is in breach of section 73(3) of the Constitution in  that
                  it was incorrectly introduced in the wrong House; and


              (d) is thus constitutionally out of order.


         In terms of Joint Rule 160(6) the Bill is constitutionally  out  of
         order. According to Joint Rule 162 the Bill may  not  be  proceeded
         with, but may be re-introduced in the correct House.


     (3)    The following Bill was introduced by the Minister of Housing  in
         the National Assembly on 5 March 2002:


         (i)     Disestablishment of South  African  Housing  Trust  Limited
              Bill [B 3 - 2002] (National Assembly -  sec  75)  [Explanatory
              summary of Bill and prior notice of its introduction published

       The Committee reports further, as follows:


       A.   Introduction


         The Select Committee  on  Finance  held  hearings  on  the  2002-03
         Division of Revenue Bill from 6 March 2002 to  8  March  2002.  The
         Committee  wishes  to  express  its   appreciation   to   all   the
         participants for their submissions  and  contributions  during  the
         hearings.  The  Committee  would   also   like   to   express   its
         appreciation to the  National  Treasury,  the  chairperson  of  the
         Financial Fiscal Commission and their staff, SALGA, the  Office  of
         the Auditor-General,  Directors-General,  Deputy  Directors-General
         and Chief Financial Officers from national  departments  for  their
         submissions  and  contributions.  Written  presentations  submitted
         form part of the records of the Committee Section.


     B.     Background information


         The Division  of  Revenue,  as  set  out  in  section  214  of  the
         Constitution, provides for the equitable  distribution  of  revenue
         raised nationally among the national, provincial and local  spheres
         of government to ensure that provinces and municipalities are  able
         to provide basic services and perform the  functions  allocated  to
         them. Additional revenue raised by provinces or municipalities  may
         not be deducted from their share of revenue  raised  nationally  or
         other allocations made to them out of national  government  revenue
         (section  227(2)  of  the  Constitution).   Provinces   and   local
         government may receive other allocations from  national  government
         revenue, either conditionally, unconditionally or in kind  (section
         227(1)(b) of the Constitution). Revenue shared  amongst  the  three
         spheres  of  government  includes  revenue  collected  at  national
         level, plus borrowing, but excludes funds  for  the  Reconstruction
         and Development Programme and social security funds.


         2. Overview of Division of Revenue Bill 2002-03


              The 2002-03 Division of Revenue Bill continues to focus on the
              broad policy priorities of the government,  with  emphasis  on
              public  spending  and  reduction  of  poverty   to   alleviate
              inequality and vulnerability. It shows strong increases in the
              equitable   share   allocations   to   both   provinces    and
              municipalities,  recognising  their  critical  role   in   the
              delivery of social development, basic household  services  and
              infrastructure.


              Rebuilding local government and meeting commitments to  ensure
              free basic  service  delivery  remains  the  government's  key
              priority, with municipal  infrastructure  financing  receiving
              substantial increases  in  allocations  over  the  next  three
              years. The Division of  Revenue  Bill  takes  account  of  the
              judgement passed by the KwaZulu-Natal High  Court  to  include
              equitable  share   allocations   for   district   category   C
              municipalities  in  the  additional   allocations   to   local
              government.
              Necessary steps are  taken  to  improve  financial  management
              capacity,  accountability  and  improved  quality  of   public
              service  delivery  across  all  spheres  of  government.   It,
              however,  became  clear  in  the  hearings  that  the  ongoing
              transformation of local government and proposed  new  policies
              and legislation have created some uncertainty in the municipal
              finance  environment.  These  include  the  Municipal  Finance
              Management Bill.


         3. National Treasury


              In its submission the National Treasury reported  real  growth
              in non-interest government spending of 4,1% a  year  over  the
              MTEF period. Additional allocations  for  government  spending
              excluding debt service costs and contingency reserve  increase
              by R13,4 billion in 2002-03 and by R17,9 billion in 2003-04.


              Positive real growth in all three  spheres  of  government  is
              reported (an inflation rate of around 6,5%  is  assumed).  The
              national allocation increasing to R6,6 billion (nominal terms)
              in 2002-03 and R8,5 billion (nominal terms) in 2003-04,  while
              provincial allocation shares increase to R5,3 million (nominal
              terms) and R7 billion (nominal  terms)  and  local  government
              share increase  by  R1,6  million  (nominal  terms)  and  R2,4
              billion (nominal terms) over the  same  period.  The  Treasury
              reported  a  marked  improvement   in   provincial   financial
              management and improved  spending  on  social  infrastructure.
              Certain departments have shown steady progress in meeting  the
              requirements  of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,  1999
              (PFMA). There was  strong  support  from  the  Office  of  the
              Auditor-General for the  government's  endeavours  to  improve
              financial management measures.
              The table below shows the revised and  medium  term  estimates
              percentage shares in the vertical division of revenue  amongst
              the three spheres of government.

              static over the MTEF period, it grows by 7,9% a year over  the
              medium-term expenditure framework. For 2001-02,  2002-03,  the
              provincial share decreases from 56,4% to 55,8%. This is partly
              due to the one-off R2 billion for social security grants,  the
              provincial supplementary grant administered  by  the  National
              Treasury being phased out.


              Two changes have been made in  the  equitable  share  formula.
              Firstly, the welfare weighting has increased by 1% at  a  cost
              of economic weighting, to take  account  of  the  increase  of
              welfare  spending  in  provincial   budgets.   Secondly,   the
              education  enrolment  data  has  been   updated.   The   seven
              components of the equitable share formula as commented upon by
              the FFC and recommended by the government include:


              Education share      41%
              Health care    19%
              Social security share     18%
              Basic share     7%
              Backlog component     3%
              Economic component    7%
              Institutional component    5%
              A  comparison  of  the  2001  actual  spending  share  to  the
              equitable share formula shows that the education share  is  2%
              less than the formula; the health  care  share  5%  more  than
              formula (tertiary services funded from conditional grants  and
              19% share in formula higher than share for provinces  with  no
              academic hospitals), and the social security share is 1%  more
              than formula.


              In  2002-03  local  government   has   the   fastest   growing
              allocations from the pool of nationally collected revenue. The
              2% budgeted share  for  2000-01  is  doubled  in  the  2002-03
              Division of Revenue Bill. Assistance for municipalities  grows
              by 18,3% a year in nominal terms. Local government  allocation
              includes support for water  and  sanitation,  electrification,
              free basic services and  local  economic  development.  Though
              static over the MTEF period, local share increases  to  4%  in
              2002-03 from 3,6% in 2001-02.


              Reform of municipal finances  is  under  way.  Among  the  key
              elements  of  the  local  government  transformation  is   the
              Municipal   Finance   Management   Bill   (MFMB),   three-year
              budgeting, the codifying of municipal accounting practices,  a
              framework for municipal borrowing and new financial  reporting
              standards.
              Priorities in the 2002-03 Division of Revenue Bill include the
              following:


              *   Extension of basic municipal services


              *   Higher  social  grants  and  increased  take-up  of  child
                support grant
              *   Social, municipal, housing and economic infrastructure


              *   Bolster health system against the impact of HIV/AIDS
              *   Extending tertiary health services and training of medical
                personnel


              *   Early childhood education programme


              The 2002-03 national priorities include the  restructuring  of
              the SA Post Office,  the  restructuring  of  the  Unemployment
              Insurance Fund, currency depreciation and fight against crime.
              Provincial  priorities   include   social   security   grants,
              education,   capital   investment   and   maintenance.   Local
              government priorities  include  infrastructure  and  capacity-
              building.


              Future changes to fiscal framework include the following:
              *   The Provincial Tax Regulation Process Act, 2001, that will
                take effect in the 2003-04  Budget  to  improve  the  fiscal
                capacity of provinces


              *   The evolution of a borrowing framework for  provinces  and
                local governments, subject  to  further  discussion  by  the
                Budget Council


              *   The transformation process for local government  is  still
                in progress


              *   The  completion  of  merging  municipalities  for  2003-04
                municipal budgets


              *   The finalisation of  the  division  of  functions  between
                category B and C municipalities


         4. Conditional grants


              (a) Overview
                  The general purpose of conditional grants is to  fund  the
                  provision  of  national  priority  programmes,  compliance
                  with norms and  standards  as  set  out  by  the  national
                  government  and  cross-border  spill-overs.  The  criteria
                  used  for  each  grant  is  different,  depending  on  the
                  purpose of the grant.


                  Overall spending  in  conditional  grants  geared  towards
                  operating activities has improved. While  there  seems  to
                  be  improvements  in  spending   on   conditional   grants
                  designed for infrastructure, underspending or no  spending
                  is still reported in respect of certain grants, (e.g.  the
                  HIV/Aids grant and the Primary School Nutrition  grant  in
                  certain provinces). The  decline  in  the  Primary  School
                  Nutrition grant from -6,19% in 2001-02 to -6,10% in  2002-
                  03 reflects  previous  underspending  and  poor  delivery.
                  Poor planning and implementation of projects seems  to  be
                  the major problem. Changes in priorities,  delays  in  the
                  development of business plans and  long  tender  processes
                  seem to be the factors contributing  to  low  expenditure.
                  Further delays are reported  in  the  transfers  of  funds
                  between   the   national   government    and    provincial
                  governments.


                  During  2001-02  spending  did  not   occur   in   certain
                  provinces in the Early Childhood Development  grant  as  a
                  result of delays in tender processes, the  setting  up  of
                  the necessary system and the delays  in  the  transfer  of
                  funds to the sites as bank accounts have not  been  opened
                  yet. Many national departments have measures in  place  to
                  monitor and evaluate the  performance  of  projects.  Most
                  departments hope to  overcome  these  bottlenecks  in  the
                  near future.


                  The HIV/AIDS grant to  the  three  departments  -  Health,
                  Education and Social Development - have been  enhanced  to
                  strengthen  the  HIV/AIDS  strategic   plan.   The   Early
                  Childhood Development grant that was introduced  in  2001-
                  02, is be phased into the equitable share in 2003-04.  The
                  roll-out of the grant, which is to be phased  in  over  10
                  years,  will  mainly  be  funded   from   the   provincial
                  equitable share. Most  grants  in  the  Health  Department
                  have been  renamed.  The  provincial  supplementary  grant
                  administered by the  National  Treasury  has  been  phased
                  out, the  funds  will  be  transferred  to  the  equitable
                  share.
              (b) Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC)


                  The FFC notes the importance of conditional grants  as  an
                  instrument for  speeding  up  access  to  basic  services,
                  given national  norms  and  standards,  as  some  national
                  departments have no clearly defined  norms  and  standards
                  that would facilitate the efficient monitoring of how  far
                  provinces  are  delivering  on  national  priorities.  The
                  FFC's position on the use of conditional  grants  is  that
                  they should be limited and should  promote  constitutional
                  intentions  with  respect  to  decentralisation  and   the
                  principles of good governance  applicable  to  subnational
                  governments.  It   is   the   view   of   the   FFC   that
                  accountability for conditional  grants  should  be  shared
                  between  the  national  government   and   the   recipient
                  government in the sense  that  they  remain  part  of  the
                  national  equitable  share,   for   which   the   national
                  government is accountable.
                  The FFC further reported improved  compliance  in  respect
                  of the PFMA reporting  and  disclosure  requirements  with
                  regard to Provincial Conditional Grants. It  is  estimated
                  that the proportion of conditional grant  value  accounted
                  for has increased from 63% to 98% to reveal the extent  of
                  underspending. Over the past two  years  underspending  on
                  Provincial Conditional Grants has  increased  from  5%  to
                  16%. This may according to the FFC reflect  management  or
                  systems inefficiencies. Underspending is high  in  respect
                  of infrastructure  grants  and  transitional  and  special
                  allocation grants, but has declined in the social  sector.
                  Slight overspending for all  health  and  welfare  grants,
                  except for HIV/AIDS, is predicted.


              (c) SALGA
                  SALGA welcomed the invitation to address the Committee  on
                  some of the difficulties they experience. SALGA's view  is
                  that despite the transition and  transformation  of  local
                  government many are not and will  not  be  sustainable  in
                  fiscal and financial terms.  A  number  of  municipalities
                  are still faced with financial  problems  associated  with
                  inefficient service delivery patterns and high  levels  of
                  poverty amongst their communities. Others  suffer  because
                  of   ineffective   management   systems   and   lack    of
                  administrative  capacities,   coupled   with   inefficient
                  budget systems.
                  SALGA's contention is that  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
                  Relations Act, 1997, be reviewed with a  view  to  include
                  organised local government in the Budget Council  in  view
                  of the consolidation of grants  to  local  government  and
                  the  increasingly  critical  role  that  local  government
                  plays in the improvement of the quality of  lives  of  the
                  poor. SALGA recommended that they  be  given  a  practical
                  role to play  in  the  fiscal  framework  associated  with
                  conditional grants design and  management  of  conditional
                  grants by various line  departments.  The  non-payment  of
                  services still plays a major role in  hampering  effective
                  financial sustainability.


                  SALGA called on for a distinction to be made  between  the
                  indigent policy and the provision of free basic  services.
                  They further echoed their support of  the  recommendations
                  of the FFC of 2001-02.


              (d) Other cross-cutting issues


                  (i)   Lack  of  capacity-building  and  section   154   of
                         Constitution


                         Section 154 of the Constitution requires  that  the
                         national  government  and  provincial   governments
                         support   and   strengthen    the    capacity    of
                         municipalities to  manage  their  own  affairs,  to
                         exercise  their  powers  and   to   perform   their
                         functions. A  strong  point  was  made  that  local
                         government should be seen as a sphere of government
                         that is responsible for key services  impacting  on
                         the lives of all South Africans.  Submissions  from
                         SALGA  suggested  that  funds  from  the   national
                         government should be directly transferred to  local
                         government  rather  than  via  provinces,  or  else
                         provincial governments  must  clearly  indicate  in
                         their budgets how much provision has been made  for
                         local government capacity-building.


                         Most departments  raised  concerns  over  capacity-
                         building in the newly  established  municipalities,
                         after the 5  December  2000  elections.  A  serious
                         problem with conditional grants  seems  to  be  the
                         lack of capacity at provincial and municipal  level
                         to administer and monitor them.


                  (ii) Division of Revenue Framework


                         There is concern over the volume of regulation  and
                         legislation  with   which   the   under-capacitated
                         municipalities have to comply. The perceived  over-
                         detailed  nature  of  these  regulations  and   the
                         unrealistically  short   compliance   periods   are
                         perceived as problematic.


                  (iii)      Lack of intergovernmental co-ordination


                         Departments called for better co-ordination between
                         different departments. The  transfer  of  functions
                         between national  and  provincial  departments  and
                         local government needs to be properly  communicated
                         as  they   have   financial   implications.   Funds
                         transferred must include service and administration
                         costs. A clear provision needs to be made  for  the
                         maintenance of the  infrastructure  that  is  being
                         transferred.   For   example,    the    electricity
                         restructuring from the national government to local
                         government may have huge implications for the local
                         government, as it might lower municipal revenue and
                         adversely impact on fiscal capacity. Regarding  the
                         Municipal Infrastructure Conditional  grant  (MIC),
                         the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry raised
                         concerns on the clarity of responsibilities between
                         the national department  of  local  government  and
                         other provincial departments.


                  (iv) Elimination of small grants


                         A suggestion was made that small conditional grants
                         must be eliminated or converted to grants in  kind.
                         Conditional grants that will eventually  be  phased
                         out, should be included in the equitable  share  to
                         provinces or local  government.  Small  grants  are
                         said to be disproportionate administrative burdens.


                  (v)  Compliance


                         Most   departments   that   appeared   before   the
                         committee, have measures in place  to  ensure  that
                         they fully comply  with  the  requirements  of  the
                         PFMA. Reduction in the number of  grants  to  lower
                         administrative burden while streamlining  decision-
                         making and consultation is important.


                  (vi) Allocation of powers and  functions  for  category  B
                         and C municipalities


                         The shifting of powers and functions between  these
                         two categories of  non-metropolitan  municipalities
                         is a significant challenge for  the  Department  of
                         Provincial and Local Government. The division could
                         have  wide-ranging  fiscal,  service  delivery  and
                         personnel implications. The view of SALGA  is  that
                         powers and  functions  must  be  allocated  to  the
                         category  of  municipality  where  they   will   be
                         administered    effectively.    Nonetheless,    the
                         department, in conjunction with  key  stakeholders,
                         are doing  all  in  their  power  to  determine  an
                         appropriate  allocation  of   functions   in   each
                         category. The  department  hopes  to  finalise  the
                         powers and functions for these categories by  April
                         2002.


     5.     Conclusion


         While initiatives made by the National  Treasury  on  working  with
         municipalities   and   provincial   governments   to   meet   their
         developmental  goals,  as  set  out  in  the   Constitution,   were
         acknowledged in the hearings, a lot  of  pressures  and  challenges
         still remain.


         Challenges   that   still   need   to   be   addressed    in    the
         intergovernmental system of South Africa, include:


         *   The  transition  and  transformation  process  in   the   local
              government sphere


         *  A more supportive system to both provinces and local  government
              to enhance their  capacity  to  spend,  manage  and  implement
              projects


         *  An improved revenue capacity and sound financial management  for
              provinces and local government


         *  The impact of  restructuring  of  the  electricity  distribution
              industry on the structure of local government finances
         *  Finalising  the  powers  and  functions  of  category  B  and  C
              municipalities


         *   A  need  to  strengthen  accountability  and  transparency  and
              increased efforts to improve reporting


         *  Introduction of tight measures to  deal  with  departments  that
              have not implemented the PFMA


         *  Improving the quality, quantity and reliability  of  information
              used in the division of nationally raised revenue


         *  Better co-ordination between various national departments


         *  Clear grant policy framework


         *  A more predictable and stable fiscal environment that will  make
              municipalities  more  attractive  to   private   lenders   and
              investors.
