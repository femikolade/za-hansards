        SUSPENSION OF COMMENCEMENT OF CROSSING-THE-FLOOR LEGISLATION

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, you may already be aware  of  this,  but  I
wish to advise you that due to an application  granted  by  the  court  last
night, the window period,  as  we  call  it,  is  not  operational.  So  the
previous advice I had given members not to complete forms  until  such  time
as we hear what the decision of the full bench later this morning is,  still
holds. We will make an announcement.

I would advise members and parties to ensure that forms  are  not  completed
until such time as there is a decision from the court.

                                 NEW MEMBER

                               (Announcement)

The Speaker announced that the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr  M  C
J van Schalkwyk had been filled, in accordance with item 6(3) of Schedule  6
of the Constitution, 1996, by the nomination of Dr R  T  Rhoda  with  effect
from 20 June 2002.

                                    OATH

Dr R T Rhoda, accompanied by Mr J J Dowry, made and subscribed the oath  and
took his seat.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr L T LANDERS: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Head of Hoopstad Prison, Mr L Phokontsi, and the  Area
       Manager of Hoopstad Prison, Mr M Tsoaeli, have worked hard towards -


       (a)  creating an atmosphere for proper rehabilitation of prisoners;


       (b)  creating  conditions  and  opportunities  for  prisoners  to  be
           released, having developed better and progressive  values  which
           contribute towards a crime-free society; and


       (c)   developing  Hoopstad  Prison  into  a   true   institution   of
           transformation;


  (2) believes that the efforts made by these prison  officials  contribute
       positively towards preventing crime and restoring the moral fibre  of
       our society;


  (3) congratulates these officials in their selfless dedication; and


  (4) calls on other prison officials to emulate this shining example.

[Applause.]

  Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) notes  that  the  floor-crossing  legislation  has  temporarily  been
       stopped by the court;


  (2) notes further that the will of the voters is what should count  in  a
       democracy;


  (3) therefore resolves that in the  event  of  floor-crossing  not  being
       possible, the ANC/New NP in the Western Cape should hold an  election
       to give the voters an opportunity of expressing their will; and


  (4) further resolves that any ward councillors anywhere in  South  Africa
       who wish to leave their party should  be  encouraged  to  resign  and
       fight a by-election.
[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) compliments the Johannesburg police on  having  acted  swiftly  after
       being tipped off about a bank robbery that was to take place at  Absa
       Bank in Parktown on Wednesday;


  (2) further compliments the police on having ensured  that  neither  they
       themselves, civilians nor robbers were hurt in the  attempt  to  foil
       the heist, thus allowing the law to take its course in respect of the
       robbers as they will soon be facing charges;


  (3) deplores the fact that the robbers are not even South  Africans,  but
       Zimbabwean nationals; and


  (4) expresses its unqualified gratitude to the members of the public  who
       blew the whistle on this unbecoming act.
[Applause.]

Mrs B M NTULI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that on  Wednesday  the  ANC  won  by-elections  in  the  rural
       stronghold of KwaDlangezwa's Ward 10 under the Mhlathuze Municipality
       on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast;


  (2) believes that the growing support for the ANC in this area  is  as  a
       result of its commitment to improving the  quality  of  life  of  the
       people and working for peace, so that development can take place; and


  (3) congratulates the ANC candidate, Comrade Riot Mkhwanazi,  on  winning
       the by-elections convincingly.

[Applause.]

Mnr J DURAND: Mev die Speaker, hiermee stel ek namens die Nuwe NP voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die DA in Kimberley, die parlementêre hoofstad  van  die  Noord-
           Kaap, in 'n tussenverkiesing vernietig is;


       (b)  die DA se steun van 1 048 stemme in 2000 na net 137 getuimel het
           en dat selfs die onafhanklike kandidaat byna 3 keer meer  stemme
           as die DA gekry het; en


       (c)  hierdie uitslag bevestig dat die DA -


           (i)   se steun besig is om te kwyn en dat dit nie 'n tuiste bied
                 vir denkende kiesers wat nie net wil raas en blaas nie; en


           (ii)  nie 'n party is vir kiesers wat 'n  verskil  wil  maak  in
                 Suid-Afrika en deel wil  wees  van  die  hoofstroompolitiek
                 nie; en
(Translation of Afrikaans follows.)

[Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby move on behalf of the New NP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the DA in Kimberley, the parliamentary capital of  the  Northern
           Cape, was destroyed in a by-election;


       (b)  support for the DA dropped from 1 048 votes in 2000 to only  137
           and that even the  independent  candidate  polled  almost  three
           times more votes than the DA did; and


       (c)  this result confirms that -


           (i)   support for the DA is  dwindling  and  that  it  does  not
                 provide a home for thinking voters who do not  simply  wish
                 to rave and rave; and


           (ii)  the DA is not a party  for  voters  who  want  to  make  a
                 difference  in  South  Africa  and  want  to  be  part   of
                 mainstream politics; and]


     (2)    believes it is time South Africans under the  DA  banner  became
         proudly   South   African   by   supporting   the   New   NP    ...
         [Interjections.] ... or stayed partially South  African  under  the
         leadership of Tony Leon and the DA, the ``Defeated Alliance''.

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at  the
next sitting of this House, without commenting on the merits of the case  or
compromising the legal proceedings underway:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the ruling of the Cape High Court last night, granting  interim
       relief to the UDM - and suspending floor-crossing  -  in  its  urgent
       application  for  an  interdict,  pending  a   Constitutional   Court
       application  on   the   constitutionality   of   the   floor-crossing
       legislation;
  (2) condemns comments made by the  presidential  spokesperson,  Mr  Bheki
       Khumalo, to the effect  that  the  Cape  High  Court  ruling  is  not
       applicable to all provinces;


  (3) acknowledges that to the best of its  knowledge  South  Africa  is  a
       unitary state, where the ruling of a High Court is applicable to  the
       country as a whole; and


  (4) notes that the UDM is exercising its legal right  and  responsibility
       to protect the rights of the voting public.
[Interjections.]

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I believe that a member can  only  move  one
notice of motion in terms of the Rules. Am I correct?  [Interjections.]  Did
you not move an earlier notice of motion?

Ms N M TSHEOLE: [Inaudible.]
The SPEAKER: My apologies.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I hereby give notice that I  shall
move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern the latest developments in the Middle  East,  which
           may prolong a war that has led to unnecessary loss of  life  and
           destruction of property in the region;


       (b)  that the intervention by the  international  community  has  not
           resulted in the eagerly awaited resumption  of  peace  processes
           that will lead to the establishment of a  sovereign  Palestinian
           state, coexisting alongside a secure state of Israel; and


       (c)  that  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  has  established  30  new  Jewish
           settlements in occupied Palestinian territories since he assumed
           power, and is now installing an electrified  security  fence  to
           control the movement of Palestinians across Israeli boundaries;


  (2) believes that the long-term security of the people of Israel lies  in
       the peaceful resolution of the crisis in the Middle East; and


  (3) calls on the international community to exert more  pressure  on  all
       parties to work towards the peaceful resolution of  the  Middle  East
       crisis.

[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -
  (1) expresses its outrage that 47 specialist doctors have been put  in  a
       position where they feel honour bound to withdraw their services from
       Rob Ferreira Hospital in Nelspruit;


  (2) acknowledges that the specialist forum is protesting the dismissal of
       the hospital's  superintendent,  Dr  Thys  von  Mollendorff,  by  the
       province's health department, after  he  had  been  found  guilty  of
       misconduct for  allowing  the  Greater  Nelspruit  Rape  Intervention
       Project, Grip, to occupy a rape-care room in the hospital;


  (3) deplores the actions of MEC Manana, who has  handled  this  situation
       shamefully, and in so doing has victimised the people of  Mpumalanga,
       especially the rape victims  who  were  so  ruthlessly  targeted  and
       disadvantaged; and


  (4) calls on the Health MEC in Mpumalanga to do the only decent thing and
       rectify the situation immediately by apologising  for  her  error  in
       judgment, reinstating Dr Von Mollendorff, and supporting Grip in  the
       excellent work they are doing for the people of Mpumalanga.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the leader of the UCDP, Kgosi L M Mangope, is a  visionary
       for all time in that the structures he put up continue to benefit not
       only South Africa, but the whole world;


  (2) further notes that Sun  City  has  recently  hosted  the  discussions
       revolving around the resolution of the  conflict  in  the  Democratic
       Republic of Congo;


  (3) believes that the use of Sun City as a venue for  civil  society  and
       women's meetings during the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development
       and the fact that the complex  will  also  relieve  the  shortage  of
       accommodation during the summit, while the  Pilansberg  Airport  will
       facilitate travel to the summit  venue,  are  a  vindication  of  his
       vision; and


  (4) calls on all people to face up to reality and accept that this leader
       has brought a legacy of wealth and development into  being  in  South
       Africa.

  Miss M N MAGAZI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  African scholars and  academics  decided  to  launch  their  own
           research studies on the implementation of Nepad during a  three-
           day  meeting  which  took  place  in  Pretoria  and  ended  last
           Thursday; and
       (b)  Prof Adele Jinadu of Nigeria  emphasised  that  this  initiative
           would not  compete  with  formal  Nepad  structures,  but  would
           complement the work they would be doing;


  (2) believes that the success of Nepad also depends on  the  mobilisation
       of academics and civil society on the continent; and


  (3)  welcomes  the  initiative  by  African  academics   to   embark   on
       multisectoral research programmes to take forward the  objectives  of
       Nepad.

[Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the DA-run Unicity of Cape Town on the  appointment  of
       an audit committee, composed of top business leaders,  academics  and
       professionals,  with  the  task  of  ensuring  compliance  with  best
       practices in corporate governance;


  (2)  recognises  that  this  step  demonstrates  a  commitment  to   good
       governance, which sets the  DA  city  government  way  ahead  of  ANC
       governments countrywide; and


  (3) urges all councils around the country to follow the DA lead.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M S M SIBIYA: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a South African rescue team aboard the SA  Agulhas  is  on
       its way to the Antarctic where over 100 people are marooned on a ship
       trapped by pack ice;
  (2) further notes that temperatures can drop to below 50 degrees  Celsius
       and that there are only two  hours  of  daylight  in  winter  in  the
       Antarctic;


  (3) hopes that the rescue team reaches the marooned ship  soon  and  that
       the mission is completed successfully; and


  (4) prays for the safe return of all involved in this mission.

Ms M C LOBE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC Youth League embarked  on  nationwide  marches  to
       highlight the problem of youth unemployment;


  (2) further notes that a stable and prosperous  future  for  our  country
       depends on the initiatives  of  all  stakeholders  to  empower  young
       people to play a meaningful role in the development of  our  country;
       and


  (3) calls on all stakeholders and the private sector  in  particular,  to
       embark  on  concrete  steps  to  address   the   problem   of   youth
       unemployment.
[Applause.]

Mnr I J PRETORIUS: Mev die Speaker, hiermee  stel  ek  namens  die  Nuwe  NP
voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met kommer kennis neem dat navorsing deur die Alliance for Children's
       Entitlement to Social Security (Acess) daarop dui dat drie  uit  vier
       kinders in armoede grootword en dat 25% van hul groei en ontwikkeling
       deur wan- of ondervoeding vertraag word;


  (2) verder kennis  neem  dat  ongeveer  die  helfte  van  Suid-Afrika  se
       bevolking moet oorleef op 'n inkomste van minder as R144 per maand en
       dat meer as 18,5 miljoen kinders hierdeur geraak word; en


  (3)  ook  daarop  let  dat  die  Nuwe  NP  homself  opnuut  verbind   tot
       armoedeverligting, want dit is veral ons kinders wat hieronder ly, en
       hulle is van ons afhanklik om hulle omstandighede te verbeter en  vir
       hulle die toekoms te gee waarop hulle geregtig is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notices of motion follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that  research  by  the  Alliance  for  Children's
       Entitlement to Social Security (Acess) indicates that  three  out  of
       every four children are raised in  poverty  and  that  25%  of  their
       growth and development is inhibited by mal- or undernourishment;


  (2) further notes that about half of the South African population has  to
       survive on an income of less than R144 per month and that  more  than
       18,5 million children are affected by this; and


  (3) also notes that the New NP has once again committed itself to poverty
       relief, because particularly our children are suffering as  a  result
       of this, and they are dependent on us to improve their  circumstances
       and provide them with the future they are entitled to.]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf  of  the  UDM  at  the
next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a large percentage  of  South  African  companies  in  the
       financial services, retail and manufacturing sectors have been forced
       to retrench their employees in the past three months;
  (2) further notes that, according to a  recent  survey  by  Deloitte  and
       Touche Human Capital Corporation, the percentage  of  companies  that
       have retrenched employees is exceedingly high,  indicating  that  the
       local economy is still depressed; and


  (3) calls on the Ministers of Labour and of Finance to heed the  findings
       of this survey and encourage  entrepreneurial skills development  and
       thus job creation, thereby alleviating the plight of  the  poor,  who
       are the harshest hit by these retrenchments.
[Applause.]

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That Rule 253(1) be suspended for the purposes of conducting  the  Second
  Reading debate on the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill [B
  15 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 75).

Question put: That the motion be agreed to.

Division demanded.

   DEBATE ON REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND INDUSTRY ON PUBLIC
                        HEARINGS ON INDUSTRIAL POLICY

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, please take your seats.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, I must commend the  House
for its commitment to industrial and manufacturing strategies.  There  is  a
major world event taking place outside this House, and the score is now one-
all.

I would like to address some of the matters raised by the  excellent  report
of the portfolio and joint committees  on  industrial  strategy.  I  believe
there are four areas that are worth addressing, in order for  us  to  obtain
some consensus and clarity on these very crucial  issues.  These  areas  are
the role of exports in our economic strategies; the role  of  knowledge  and
its impact on employment and unskilled workers; the role of  the  trade  and
industry institutions in  the  manufacturing  strategy;  and  what  specific
actions can be taken with the private sector to carry out that strategy.

There was comment at the hearings - and also in the report - that we  should
possibly be cautious of placing excessive emphasis  on  exports  as  leading
our growth process. I would like to submit that in some respects there is  a
misunderstanding here. I  submit  that  in  the  global  economy  today,  an
economy that is not capable of exporting is also not capable  of  developing
itself domestically.

These are not opposing or alternate parts between developing one's  domestic
economy and exports. The global economy, as  we  have  seen,  is  one  where
there is an increased level of trade in all products. All economies are  far
more open than they have  been  for  many  centuries.  Accordingly,  we  are
increasingly operating within a single global economy, and  our  ability  to
produce and trade in that economy is also, in effect, our ability to  export
our products in a competitive manner. Therefore, the strategy  that  we  are
looking at is not one that is designed just to promote exports, but also  to
change and restructure the economy so that its  total  capacity,  no  matter
where the product is sold in the final market, is competitive.

An important reference was made to a very interesting  study  done  recently
by Unctad, on the question  of  exports  -  and  manufacturing  exports,  in
particular - in the developing world.  They  make  the  point,  and  a  very
correct point, that it is not just the level of exports that  is  important,
but also the value-added component within  the  domestic  economy.  That  is
also very important.

This is a point that we entirely accept. The paper sets  out  our  strategic
response to this question, and that is to focus our attention very  much  on
the value change or the value matrices. What we mean  by  this  is  that  we
should continually access where we  can  add  value  in  our  economy.  What
linkages we can create between different parts of  the  economy,  all  those
linkages being in themselves internationally competitive.

This allows us, as well, to develop those parts  of  the  economy  that  are
primarily focused on  sale  into  the  domestic  market.  So,  we  are  very
conscious of this requirement in our strategy, ie that we must act across  a
broad front of areas, in order to ensure that the level of value added,  and
net exportation from our economy is rising, not falling.

In South Africa we had certain successes in this area, but we still  have  a
considerable amount of work to do. The advantage we have as an  economy  and
as a society is that we have  an  immense  resource  base,  allowing  us  to
beneficiate a large number of different products and, therefore, bring  them
into the manufacturing process for a greater value-added component.

Another point of concern that has been raised on a number of  occasions  is,
are we correct in emphasising the question of the  knowledge  economy?  Will
this not create a situation where we will not be able  to  employ  unskilled
workers? Is it not inappropriate  for  South  Africa,  which  has  a  skills
shortage?

Our argument is that this  is  not  something  that  offers  a  choice.  The
processes of production in the world are changing.  They  are  being  driven
increasingly by our capacity  to  manipulate  and  transfer  knowledge  and,
therefore, to avoid that or not to  place  this  at  the  forefront  of  our
priorities would be a serious error. It does  not,  however,  mean  that  we
are, therefore, not going to be able  to  employ  less  skilled  workers  or
unskilled workers. A range of strategies would be necessary.

In a study that my own department has done, it is very  interesting  to  see
that as a proportion of the work force, in the year 2001 an average of  only
just over 10% of the total workforce in the manufacturing industry could  be
considered to be highly skilled workers. The rest  would  be  less  skilled,
semiskilled and unskilled workers.

So, the issue at stake here is to develop our industrial sectors,  and  that
is crucial. That will  assist  us  in  creating  employment  for  the  wider
workforce. In any event, as we know, we are making considerable progress  in
ensuring that the vast majority of all our citizens go through to  secondary
level education, and this in  itself  creates  an  employment  base  and  an
employment capacity for the type of economy that we are trying to build.

So, once again, I submit that the choice of a knowledge  economy  is  not  a
choice, it is an imperative. It is something that we have to  move  towards.
But it does not mean that we are, therefore, not conscious of and  will  not
be able to employ less skilled workers.

Let me, very briefly, deal with the role of the institutions within what  we
call the Council of Trade  and  Industry  Institutions.  I  think  that  the
report made a valid point that possibly the submissions made here  were  not
always coherent. I think this is true. We are working  through  the  Council
of Trade and Industry Institutions - a very  interesting  innovation  within
the structures of Government - to align these processes. However,  there  is
no  question  whatsoever  that  some  of  these  institutions  play  a  very
important role, indeed.

The  Council  for  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research,   the   Industrial
Development Corporation and the SA Bureau of Standards are,  in  particular,
the major institutions that have an impact on the economy.  That  impact  is
not always visible. As we have seen in  recent  times,  a  major  structural
change  has  been  brought  about  in  our  steel  industry,  and  this   is
essentially through the ability of the  Industrial  Development  Corporation
to negotiate with financial muscle for a  restructuring  of  that  industry,
very much to the benefit of the industry and the iron  ore  mining  industry
in South Africa.

So, the IDC plays a critical role in many sectors of  the  economy.  Members
felt that it should possibly be more focused on small business. I  will  put
a slight proviso in on that. The Industrial  Development  Corporation  is  a
specialist institution. In fact, it is probably one of the best of its  kind
in the world. Its basic strength  is  its  ability  accurately  to  identify
projects that will be successful and finance them over  a  sustained  period
of time. It is not a developmental agency, as such. It is  not  designed  to
bring about a large number  of  small  businesses  in  our  economy.  It  is
designed to bring about very vibrant, active  small  businesses  that  will,
themselves, impact on the rest of the economy.

Let me, finally, give some examples of what we  are  doing  in  practice  to
bring about change in our economy. Most members are familiar with the  Motor
Industry Development Programme, but probably not with what actually goes  on
in that programme. We have a strategic investment  committee  with  all  the
automobile industries, ie component, steel and aluminium manufacturers,  and
we systematically examine the totality of the industry as to what  component
goes into the industry and whether it would  be  feasible  to  produce  that
component competitively in  South  Africa.  This  has  led  to  considerable
investments in the economy, but it is painstaking and detailed work.

Another example would be Cape Town and Durban. Hon members may have  noticed
that South Africa's exportation of yachts and ocean-going crafts  has  risen
very rapidly. We now export more than half a billion  rands  worth  of  such
equipment. How do we do this? We do it merely by talking  to  the  industry,
and assisting them to promote their products abroad.  Increasingly,  we  are
starting to work together with them to get  skilled  training  here  in  the
Cape and in the Durban areas. So, we get higher quality  crafts  people  who
can  produce  the  excellent  products  that  South  Africa  is  capable  of
producing.

Sometimes we do some  very  basic  things.  Most  members  who  watched  the
Comrades Marathon  on  17  June  would  have  continually  seen  the  little
Spirulina advert that was up there. Now in the Free State we have started  a
new facility to create  even  larger  quantities  of  Spirulina,  using  old
facilities in a milling company where there was  a  lot  of  space  for  the
water that is needed for that. So, it is this kind  of  detailed  work  that
one gets down to with industries, to create possibilities.

Finally, in the information and communication technology industry,  we  have
recently started a learnership. A group of  1  000  youngsters  have  joined
four major companies on a learnership programme, and this  is  an  extremely
exciting  prospect.  They  will  get  certification  on  a  wide  range   of
information and communication technology dimensions.

So an industrial or  manufacturing  strategy  is  not  some  grand  plan  or
miracle cure. It is plain hard work,  a  lot  of  attention  to  detail  and
focusing on what is possible and what is not. [Applause.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Madam Speaker, it is  difficult  to  be  controversial  before
lunch and, in any event, my party has already expressed  the  view  that  it
supports many aspects of the policy that has been put forward  by  the  DTI.
But we do not feel exactly the same way about some of the appeals that  were
made during the hearings, and that is what I will now briefly reflect  upon.


First, let me welcome, in the gallery up there, all  those  businessmen  who
have come to be electrified by this debate here today. [Laughter.]

One can bet one's bottom dollar that politicians  and  bureaucrats,  whether
they believe in God or Marx, have a touching faith in industrial policy.  It
is conveniently  packaged  and  branded  as  a  means  of  increasing  their
influence or power.

Similarly, businessmen who have a preference for  special  pleading,  rather
than  competition,  find  themselves  allies  of  the  bureaucracy  in  this
respect. Whether or not  industrial  policy  contains  economic  nourishment
needs close examination,  for  the  political  strength  of  the  brand  can
obscure the economic efficiency of the policy.

As that famous advertising man, David Ogilvy, once said, and I quote:

  Carnation Milk is the best in the land
  Here I sit with a can in my hand
  No tits to pull, no hay to pitch,
  You just punch a hole in the son of a bitch.

But Carnation Milk  has  proved  to  be  no  substitute  for  the  cow,  and
industrial policy is not a  substitute  for  efficient  resource  allocation
through market initiative.

Enthusiasts look to Japan, where the interventions of the fabled  Miti  have
been credited with supernatural apprehension of the demands of  the  future.
Yet the massive targeting of steel in the sixties and seventies led, in  the
eighties, to the  lay-off  of  more  than  50  000  steel  workers  and  the
scrapping of underused plants.

Miti's attempts to discourage the expansion of  the  Japanese  car  industry
are legendary. In 13 industrial sectors between 1955 and 1990, there  was  a
negative correlation between the rate of growth  and  the  level  of  policy
support.

The European Union's policy of picking winners has  proved  to  be  no  more
successful.  Bureaucrats  allocated   taxpayers'   resources   to   selected
industrial clusters. They failed to understand that markets are  spontaneous
mechanisms, and fell victim to the fatal conceit that civil servants can  do
better. While they were doing this, the Soviet  empire  was  crumbling,  and
the Chinese began to recognise that politicians and bureaucrats do not  have
the knowledge of time, place and circumstance, which is a  prerequisite  for
efficient economic choices.

In Britain, during the sixties, an industrial policy  approach,  similar  to
the more recent European Union one, was  tried  by  the  Wilson  government.
Here, in 1994, similar industrial triangles were mooted, which  reflected  a
desire to move towards what was called industrial democracy.

The outcome in Britain was  the  Thatcher  policies  of  the  seventies  and
eighties, which have given that economy nearly three decades of  sustainable
growth. Here we are still in a period of industrial malaise,  talking  about
Thatcher  policies  with  superficial  enthusiasm,  but  implementing   very
little.
None of this means that my party is against government intervention. On  the
contrary,  intervention   is   sometimes   vital,   especially   to   foster
competition, but also to counteract market failure and government failure.

Ronald Coase, the American Nobel Prize  winner,  developed  in  the  sixties
what he called the ``Coase Theorem''. Simply put, it is  that  markets  will
operate efficiently if transaction costs are low, and  property  rights  are
clearly specified. If they are not,  interventions  along  these  lines  are
needed to counter market failure.

However, Coase is also a part of that school  of  public  choice  economists
who have demonstrated that government failure, too,  can  cause  markets  to
malfunction. The redlining of which banks in the housing market are  accused
is a rational response to being unable to repossess their property in  areas
where Government has failed to maintain law and order.

Politicians and bureaucrats have a  bias  towards  unnecessary  intervention
and regulation to gain political support, and expand career prospects  under
the guise of doing social good. They have  no  property  rights,  so  cannot
gain from trade, nor do they suffer swift and direct  personal  losses  from
errors in misdirected capital  and  labour  resources.  Not  only  are  they
likely to be cavalier in this direction, but they seldom, if ever, focus  on
the interests of consumers and taxpayers,  who  drive  savings,  investments
and entrepreneurial endeavour.

Indifference towards consumers has been responsible  for  many  failures  in
the past. The cost of bureaucratic  mistakes  is  not  easily  visible.  The
costs, in terms of alternative products, lower prices or job  opportunities,
are  obscure.   However,   the   beneficiaries   of   misdirected   official
interventions benefit swiftly and visibly, but  the  cost  of  inappropriate
interventions are diffused over the entire population, and are hidden.

The appropriate agents for growth and prosperity are entrepreneurs who  have
an incentive to  satisfy  consumers.  Entrepreneurship  is  the  only  truly
costless resource. It creates previously unrevealed profit opportunities  by
exploiting   continually   changing   consumer   preferences   and   product
technologies that are largely beyond anticipation.

We do not know what innovations are ahead of us, and how they are  going  to
turn out. Long-term strategies that try to foresee innovation are  bound  to
be wrong. That  has  been  the  experience  of  decades.  So,  the  crux  of
industrial policy should be to find the means of  releasing  entrepreneurial
endeavour and providing  appropriate  incentives  to  investors  in  what  a
government might consider to be socially desirable enterprises.

The trick is to be able to do this when  no  one  has  yet  perceived  these
possibilities. These  incentives  must  centre  on  the  right  to  own  and
exchange property and to keep business costs  down  to  competitive  levels.
They should  not  include  cash  handouts  or  sweetheart  loans,  for  that
encourages rent-seeking and corrupt  practices  rather  than  profit-seeking
behaviour.  Prescribed  investments  that  force  investors  into   projects
favoured by politicians  and  bureaucrats  are  equally  wasteful,  open  to
corruption and reduce the innovative incentive needed to  seek  and  exploit
innovation and opportunity, which abound globally.

What are the priorities of industrial policy? First, it  must  make  markets
better by keeping down transaction costs, ensuring the  right  to  ownership
and exchange  and  encouraging  entrepreneurs.  Second,  it  has  to  foster
innovative investment trends  that  are  revealed  by  the  markets  as  new
technologies emerge. The trend towards manufacturing investment is  part  of
that process that needs encouraging.  Third,  it  has  to  focus,  in  these
respects, on small businesses of proven viability and innovation,  for  they
are capable of rapid  job  creation  and  dexterous  adaptation  to  as  yet
unrecognised opportunities.

Fourth, a full impact analysis should be conducted of all existing laws  and
regulations that impact on small business, and legislation  that  introduces
flexibility to regulations should be introduced.  Labour  laws  and  levies,
the ownership of mining rights and taxation are important  in  this  regard.
Fifth, there should be  a  shift  in  policy  formation  from  political  to
economic imperatives, and acknowledgement that, as far as small business  is
concerned,  they  are  trade-offs  between  fostering  small  business   and
encouraging black empowerment and income redistribution. This  needs  to  be
done through rational and unemotional interaction.

Finally, Government should take  note  of  the  reluctance  of  business  to
participate in recent hearings on industrial policy, for there is a  looming
dislocation between business and Government that, if  left  unchecked,  will
not augur well for savings, investment and growth, let alone  redistribution
and black empowerment. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  would  like  to
address you on a point of order. The hon  member  who  just  spoke  now,  Mr
Nigel Bruce, attributed a quote to a particular gentleman.  In  this  quote,
there was a line referring to ``the son of a bitch''. Now, the problem  with
that is that Mr Bruce opened the quotation marks, but did not indicate  when
that quote ended. Therefore, it follows that  that  becomes  his  particular
expression.

The SPEAKER: I will look at the Hansard, and give a ruling on it.

Dr R H DAVIES:  Madam  Speaker,  serious  economic  policy  debate  in  this
country, which I am not too sure Mr Bruce is part of,  is  no  longer  about
whether we need an active industrial or manufacturing policy. Rather, it  is
now sharply focused on the what the content of that policy should be.

There are very few former colonial  or  semi-colonial  countries  that  have
succeeded in promoting even a modest level of industrial  development.  Even
the World Bank was forced to admit, in the study on east  Asia,  that  those
very few countries that had succeeded, all had in common  active  industrial
policies.

Mr Bruce said just now that he was not against intervention  by  the  state.
He said his party was not against intervention by Government.  But  then  he
proceeded, in most of his speech, to argue against it. I hope that,  in  the
fullness of time, the DP can clarify whether or not it is in  favour  of  an
industrial policy. I think it was an extremely unclear intervention that  we
heard just now.

Our real challenge, in my view, is to apply the lesson of  economic  history
that an industrial policy is necessary in a way that is appropriate  to  our
own specific context and circumstances, which differ in  important  respects
from those of other successful newly industrialised economies  at  the  time
when they adopted their own industrial policies.

Apartheid   bequeathed   our   country   a   form   of   dependent,    semi-
industrialisation. It is true that we have inherited  an  industrial  sector
that is larger and more extensive than that in  many  developing  countries.
However, it was a sector that was  orientated  towards  the  higher  income,
mainly white, domestic consumer market, dependent on high levels  of  tariff
protection and also on foreign exchange, which was earned  by  the  sale  of
primary products.

Over the last 20 years of apartheid rule, it was becoming evident that  this
pattern  of  industrialisation  was  increasingly  unsustainable   and   the
industrial sector entered into a serious and potentially fatal  decline.  In
our struggle to transform that faltering industrial sector  into  an  engine
of growth capable of contributing to development in our country we have  had
to contend with another major challenge, i.e globalisation.

This has seen not just the lowering of tariff  barriers  across  the  world,
and not just an expansion of cross-border trade in manufactured  goods,  but
also a very profound change in the organisation of  production.  Writers  of
various ideological persuasions have agreed that the rise of what is  called
the informational economy is as profound in  terms  of  its  impact  on  all
productive activity as was the Industrial Revolution of the  18th  and  19th
centuries.

Information and communications technology-derived knowledge has  become  the
major driver of productivity increases in all sectors and  all  branches  of
production. This process of  transition  to  an  informational  economy  has
clearly required an adaptation by productive sectors across the world.

But the globalisation  process  is  also  one  associated  with  threats  of
marginalisation and widening inequality. The Minister  referred  to  Untag's
trade and development report for 2002, which  records  just  one  aspect  of
relevance to manufacturing sectors in developing countries. As the  Minister
indicated, the Untag report points to  the  reality  that  increased  export
performance by developing countries is not  necessarily  matched  by  rising
incomes. The Untag report notes a number  of  reasons  for  this,  including
trade barriers  in  developed  countries,  which  have  blocked  access  for
products where developing countries are either competitive or  could  become
so.
However, the Untag report also makes the important point that the  evolution
of globalisation has seen a refinement of the existing  unequal  and  uneven
global division of labour, in which knowledge-intensive parts of  production
processes are being located and relocated to developed countries, while  the
less knowledge-intensive, basic manufacturing processes are being  relocated
to   selected   developing   countries,   which   become   integrated   into
international value chains in a dependent and subaltern manner.

A number of elements of an appropriate industrial policy  have,  of  course,
been put in place since our democratic Government  was  installed  in  1994.
The initial focus was on promoting a need to respond as a matter of  urgency
to the  challenge  of  adjusting  to  an  inevitably  lower  tariff  regime.
Identifying  and  creating  export  opportunities  and   reforming   support
packages to move away from subsidies to targeted supply-side  measures  were
also among major initiatives.

In addition, there were highly indicative sector-specific  initiatives.  The
Motor Industry Development Programme, which the Minister  referred  to,  for
example, highlighted the importance of  inclusive,  strategic  vision  being
developed in particular sectors. The  Industrial  Development  Corporation's
role in mainly  large-scale  beneficiation  projects  also  pointed  to  the
potential of an entity acting to identify, as its  mission  statement  says,
``opportunities not yet addressed by the market''.

While we may have avoided the threat of deindustrialisation in this  period,
it is clear that much remains to be done to ensure  that  our  manufacturing
sector makes its full potential contribution to efforts  to  promote  growth
and development in our country.  Figures  quoted  in  the  DTI's  integrated
manufacturing strategy document show  that  we  are  far  from  the  dangers
highlighted in the Untag report. The statistics show that while  exports  of
manufactured goods increased from 39% of total exports in the early '90s  to
an impressive 51% in 2000, manufactured output  increased  by  a  much  more
modest 1,8% per annum on average, while, as the report itself  acknowledges,
job losses in manufacturing have tended to accelerate.

The adoption of the microeconomic reform  strategy  was  predicated,  in  my
understanding, on the realisation that while we have made some  gains  since
1994, much more needs to be done to place  our  economy  on  a  development-
orientated growth path. The adoption of that microeconomic strategy has,  in
my view, placed the refinement, development and extension of  an  industrial
or manufacturing strategy right at the centre  of  our  efforts  to  promote
growth and development.

It  has  already  been  mentioned  that  the  DTI  launched  its  integrated
manufacturing strategy draft document last month, and that we had two  weeks
of public hearings in our committee. The report which we are debating  today
was published in the  ATC  of  6  June.  That  report  records  a  range  of
opinions, but also a degree of consensus on some of the main themes  in  the
IMF document.

This agreement includes agreement on the need for an  active  industrial  or
manufacturing policy that reaches beyond traditional  manufacturing  sectors
to include services  and  primary  producing  sectors  as  well.  There  was
agreement on the usefulness of the integrated value  matrix  approach  as  a
concept for promoting dynamic linkages up and down value  streams,  as  well
as across sectors. There was agreement on the need to promote  a  transition
from dialogue to collective action by stakeholders. There was  agreement  on
the proposal that the DTI should  offer  customised  support  programmes  to
priority sectors.

Our report also includes a number of  observations  and  recommendations  of
our own. I do not have time to  discuss  them  all,  but  I  would  like  to
highlight one or two points. First, I would like to address  myself  to  the
point which the Minister himself touched on in pointing in  documents  to  a
number of tensions, not in  the  sense  of  absolute  alternatives,  but  of
issues that arise from objective  circumstances  which  require  choice  and
emphasis.
This includes the  tension  between  the  need  to  address  the  very  real
challenge  of  raising   the   competitiveness   of   existing   established
industries, and the imperative to create  employment  and  income-generating
opportunities accessible to the masses of  our  people,  particularly  those
living in historically disadvantaged and  underdeveloped  areas.  A  related
tension is that between the need to promote  export-orientated  sectors  and
the need to develop economic  activities  in  sectors  and  areas  that  are
likely in the short term to be largely confined to  the  domestic  and  open
economy. In each of these, there is a need  to  rise  to  the  challenge  of
knowledge. But the  issue  of  raising  the  knowledge  component  does  not
necessarily mean exactly the same in each of these poles.

No one would seriously argue that we can operate in any one of  these  poles
to the exclusion of the others. The integrated value  matrix  approach  aims
precisely to try to find the dynamic linkages. But there are some very  real
issues of balance and emphasis. One of the main messages of  our  report  is
that  we  need  to  tilt  the  balance  more  in  favour  of  the  poor  and
marginalised, and emphasise activities that promote and  sustain  employment
and can integrate the poor and the marginalised into productive activity.

Our report  also  includes  10  specific  recommendations,  and  I  want  to
highlight a couple of them. First,  we  have  suggested  that  there  is  an
urgent need to spell out more concretely and in detail  how  the  Government
and the DTI are seeking to  promote  the  transition  through  dialogue  and
collective action. Some of those who appeared before us argued  strongly  in
favour of giving more emphasis to sectoral summits. I know  there  are  some
reservations about the utility of this mechanism  and  several  observations
on the shortcomings of dialogue up to now were recorded in  our  report.  We
suggest that what is needed is for the mechanism to promote this  transition
to be spelt  out  in  more  detail  and  discussed  and  agreed  to  by  key
stakeholders.

The second point I want to refer to concerns the role of  the  IDC.  I  take
the point that the IDC is a specialised agency and is not  a  mechanism  for
the massive promotion of small business, particularly micro and  very  small
business. The point is that the mandate  of  the  IDC,  as  I  have  already
indicated, is to identify and support opportunities  not  yet  addressed  by
the markets.

What we  suggest  in  our  report  is  that  the  IDC  has  done  this  very
effectively in the large-scale  upstream  beneficiation  projects,  but  not
sufficiently in the promotion of smaller enterprises and  empowerment  which
the corporation itself now identifies as key priorities. We suggest that  it
needs to act more strategically in these areas as well.

Thirdly, we suggest that there is  a  serious  need  to  consider  the  CSIR
suggestion of offering development and research services as a  component  of
customised support packages. There  is  a  worrying  trend  towards  reduced
involvement of big private sector organisations in research and  development
in South Africa, a trend  which  threatens  to  reinforce  the  division  of
labour where knowledge intensity is  located  in  developed  countries.  The
current model of providing poor support  and  then  requiring  research  and
development bodies like the CSIR to  undertake  contract  work  may  not  be
ideal. The CSIR told us this was forcing them into short-term work,  instead
of longer-term research and development. We  suggest  the  need  to  explore
other  models,  conscious  of  the  fact  that  these  may  have   budgetary
implications.

Finally, our report suggest the need to take account of  recommendations  of
the Commission for Gender Equality on engendering the IMS and ensuring  that
the customised support programme supports gender equality and also the  need
to promote a higher level of  co-ordination  between  different  spheres  of
Government.

With these words, I commend the  report  to  the  attention  of  the  House.
[Applause.]

Debate interrupted.

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(i)
                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER:  Order!  Hon  members,  I  need  to  correct  what  the  quorum
requirements are. I did give a figure,  but  in  fact  that  does  meet  the
quorum, which is only one third. Fortunately, this  was  brought  out  after
the vote was taken. So the vote that was shown - and we  have  the  names  -
was 151 ayes and 30 noes. Therefore, the motion was carried. [Applause.]

I do apologise to members, but I can also plead exhaustion. I  am  not  sure
why members were not awake enough. Perhaps they were up  till  midnight!  We
will now proceed with the rest of this debate.

 RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND INDUSTRY
                   ON PUBLIC HEARINGS ON INDUSTRIAL POLICY

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, regarding the contribution of the  hon  Bruce,
it would be difficult for me to sip with him from the  same  condensed  milk
tin. But I want to protect him, to a certain extent, from the other  members
in this House. They should know that the hon Bruce is  an  honourable  cynic
and as such, one  must  try  to  understand  him  a  little  bit  better.  I
understand him perfectly and we are very good  friends  in  this  particular
regard. Today I found him to be extra fantastically amusing.

It gives me pleasure to express the support of the IFP with  regard  to  the
report on industrial policy. It is essential that we shift the  emphasis  in
this country much more towards the expansion of our  industrial  capacities.
The hon the Minister referred to the skills  shortage  and  has  defined  it
more  clearly.  There  is  an  understanding  from  his   side   about   the
requirements regarding skills. In this particular regard,  I  also  want  to
thank him for the  rationality  that  he  brought  in  with  regard  to  the
previous debate on the Immigration Bill, where the  quota  system  had  been
questioned. His contribution in terms of that had been  significant  to  the
rethinking of that whole process.

What we are looking at with regard  to  industrialisation  is  obviously  to
support the economic growth of  South  Africa.  If  one  works  on  economic
growth, this is the engine room for job creation. The  more  growth  we  can
have, the more jobs there would be in the end. To us it is very  clear  that
Government cannot  create  jobs.  The  Public  Service,  municipalities  and
statutory bodies simply do not have the capacity to create wealth and  jobs.
This must be done primarily by the private sector, and in  this  regard  the
manufacturing industry can play a very important role.

If we look at industrialisation, we  immediately  become  embroiled  in  the
present crisis with regard to the inflation rates and  inflation  spiralling
out of control. Yesterday I said that one must go back  to  the  fundamental
definition of inflation. The elementary definition would be, as I said,  too
much money chasing too few goods. One would then either  curtail  the  money
supply or increase the goods. Manufacturing is exactly the  basis  on  which
this can be done. Therefore, we must work very hard on this.

However, there is also the question of the currency of South Africa and  the
currency level as it  is  at  the  moment,  if  it  can  be  stabilised  and
contained around R10 to the dollar. I think  we  are  in  a  very  fortunate
position with the comparative advantages that are  there  in  terms  of  our
exports. We have already seen  this  in  terms  of  particularly  the  motor
industry and how they have developed in acquiring these skills.

With regard to manufacturing, we have the IDZs that  are  being  recognised.
Members will recall that in previous debates I have  punted  and  worked  on
the possibility of Richard's Bay being recognised. Now that  this  has  come
to fruition, a lot is going to happen in that area. I still  think  that  it
is up to the business sector and  manufacturers  to  exploit  the  situation
which is available to them.

It is with apprehension, but also with great pleasure, that  one  has  noted
that the aluminium smelter in Coega could become a reality. This could  mean
massive inputs in South Africa of  foreign  capital  that  will  stream  in.
Think about all these things and what they can do to help the South  African
economy, and how we can improve our currency even further.

Ons het aansporingsmaatreëls nodig om tot 'n mate die toedrag  van  sake  te
wysig   in   Suid-Afrika   waar   so   baie    industrialiste    en    veral
versekeringsmaatskappye  belê  in  groot  sakekomplekse   vir   supermarkte.
Aansporingsmaatreëls kan sorg dat hierdie maatskappye eerder begin  belê  in
maatskappye wat  vervaardigingsprosesse  onderneem,  want  dan  is  dit  nie
bestaande rykdom wat hersirkuleer word nie,  maar  wel  die  skep  van  nuwe
rykdom. Dit is my groot voorreg om hierdie verslag te ondersoek en  die  IVP
se samewerking te verseker. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We need incentive measures to modify to  a  certain  extent  the  state  of
affairs in  South  Africa  where  so  many  industrialists,  and  especially
insurance companies, invest in  big  business  complexes  for  supermarkets.
Incentive measures can ensure that these companies begin to  invest  instead
in companies that undertake manufacturing processes, because then it is  not
existing wealth that is being recycled,  but  indeed  the  creation  of  new
wealth. It is my great  privilege  to  examine  this  report  and  give  the
assurance of the IFP's co-operation.]

Mr S M RASMENI: Chairperson, Minister and members  of  Parliament,  when  we
took over the reins of power in this country in  1994,  it  was  clear  that
urgent intervention was required  from  the  new  democratic  Government  to
ensure that we addressed economic imbalances and uneven  development  within
and between South Africa's regions, as well as developing a  prosperous  and
balanced regional economy in Southern Africa  based  on  the  principles  of
equity and mutual benefit. The objective was  also  to  integrate  into  the
world economy that sustains a viable  an  efficient  domestic  manufacturing
capacity, and increase our potential to export manufactured products.

There is no doubt that the key  goals  of  our  industrial  strategy  are  a
substantial  increase  in  our  net  national  investment,   especially   in
manufacturing, job creation and meeting the basic needs of our  people.  The
central objective is the commitment to improve the quality of  life  of  all
South Africans, and in particular the  most  marginalised  sections  of  our
communities.

We commend the work done  by  the  ANC-led  Government,  in  particular  the
Ministry of Trade and Industry, during this eight-year term  in  which  they
responded very well to the deep-seated structural crisis of the  economy  as
a result of apartheid and colonial policies  of  the  past.  These  policies
only promoted white interests at the expense of the black majority  of  this
country.

This new Government has set  out  to  transform  the  economy  in  order  to
improve the lives of all our people, including a macroeconomic  intervention
to  address  the  debt  and  balance  of  payments  crisis  threatening  the
sustainability  of  economic  transformation.  This  demonstrates  a   clear
commitment to the principles of the Freedom Charter adopted in 1955  by  the
Congress of the People, which states the following under the  heading  ``The
people shall share in the country's wealth'', and I quote:


  The national wealth of our country, the heritage of South Africans, shall
  be restored to the people ...;


  All other industry and trade shall be controlled to assist the  wellbeing
  of the people;


  All people shall have  equal  rights  to  trade  where  they  choose,  to
  manufacture and to enter all trades, crafts and professions.

An industrial strategy has to be formulated within the economic  context  it
operates in. The context determines the existing performance  and  structure
of the manufacturing sector. Therefore, the objective of the policy must  be
clearly specified. The implementation  strategy  by  which  it  meets  these
objectives must also be identified and  concrete  policies  established,  in
order to fast-track the implementation of this strategy for our country.

The strategy announced by the President in his state of the  nation  address
in  February  2001   outlined   the   need   for   co-ordinated   Government
interventions  in   areas   which   include   technology,   human   resource
development, access to finance and infrastructure. This is  a  guide  and  a
marching line for all of us.

The industrial policy debate in South Africa's economy should be  understood
against the background of the legacy of  apartheid  policies  that  promoted
underdevelopment, economic  and  social  exclusion,  and  disaster  for  the
majority of the population in our country. For these reasons,  all  coherent
strategies must meet  the  challenges  of  a  changing  world  economy  and,
simultaneously, meet the needs of the majority of our people.

Addressing these issues has  been  of  critical  concern  to  the  Portfolio
Committee on Trade and Industry over  the  past  few  years.  The  Portfolio
Committee on Trade and  Industry,  the  Select  Committee  on  Economic  and
Foreign  Affairs,  the  Department  of  Trade   and   Industry   and   other
stakeholders decided, jointly, to lend a hand to push back the frontiers  of
poverty.

Hence, we convened  public  hearings  in  Parliament  on  industrial  policy
development from 23 April  to  7  May  2002.  Submissions  were  invited  to
address a range of issues related to the industrial policy  and  comment  on
the discussion document of the Department of  Trade  and  Industry  entitled
``Accelerating Growth and Development''. The contribution of the  integrated
manufacturing strategy was released in April 2002.

This document seeks to improve the realisation of South  Africa's  potential
in the underdeveloped part of our economy, which is  characterised  by  weak
growth declining investment and savings rates low levels  of  investment  in
research and development  falling  formal  employment  and  high  levels  of
unemployment, especially among black people and women in all racial  groups.
These characteristics are manifested in  and  reflect  the  high  levels  of
inequality and poverty that still prevail in our country.

We believe that the essence of a manufacturing or industrial strategy is  to
address the existing industrial  structure  and  its  implications  for  the
possible future development paths of the economy to  create  employment,  in
order to make ends meet. Full  economic  participation  across  issues  like
race and gender should be among the core challenges  for  an  effective  and
efficient  industrial  policy  in  our  country,   as   reflected   in   the
microeconomic reform strategy document. The need  for  a  coherent  plan  to
take collective actions forward to implementation is a core element of  this
strategy.

Clear targets are to be set  and  an  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation
framework  put  in  place  to  address  black  economic  empowerment,  small
business development, employment  and  the  geographic  spread  of  economic
activity.  We  also  need  to  ensure  equitable  participation  by   women,
especially black rural women, in our country. The gender  perspective  needs
to  be  integrated  into  all  other  policy  processes.  Thus,   industrial
restructuring should have an evident effect on women as their  participation
in the economy is of the utmost importance.

We need to ensure that strategies promote the development of  industries  in
a transforming manner, especially women's organisations, which  need  to  be
taken more into  account  in  economic  decision-making.  In  doing  so,  we
attempt to address SMMEs, co-operatives, access to  training,  participation
in policy formulation, the elimination of occupational segregation, and  the
monitoring of policy impacts, access to finance; attention to market  access
and unfair competition.

However, the high levels of poverty and unemployment are still giving  cause
for concern in achieving appropriate economic integration to get rid of  the
high levels of inequality that still exist.  Financial  institutions  should
take prompt action to make loans available to the  previously  disadvantaged
sector of our population, whilst developing a more efficient  and  customer-
friendly financial market in this country. The  foremost  challenge  to  the
nonfinancial sector is to resolve inadequate capacity and  indebtedness  and
press ahead with reform of the supply side structure.

The Government should create an environment conducive to reform and  improve
employment opportunities for those who are unemployed.  The  private  sector
should take the initiative to rejuvenate existing industries,  open  up  new
areas of business and industry  and  secure  employment  opportunities.  The
Government and industry should co-operate in developing a national  strategy
to encourage the growth of industries capable of leading the economy in  the
next century.

Government-industry  collaboration  is  also  needed  ...  [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, the MF agrees  that
a need exists to  develop  a  manufacturing  industry  strategy  that  would
establish  and  outline  key  objectives  and  priorities   for   industrial
development and advancement. It also agrees that it is time we shifted  from
talk to action. We have policies in place. We are now  talking  about  other
policies, but we have to learn to  put  the  current  policies  into  action
effectively and efficiently.

Our eyes are not closed to the fact that the many divisions, categories  and
forms existing in the industrial and manufacturing sectors do not allow  for
policy changes to be made easily. Each is based within a different  scenario
and activation is possible, but somehow  the  changes  and  strategy  to  be
implemented have to be such that each  sector  should  be  able  to  conform
without too much hassle.

The shift from macroeconomic  stability  to  microeconomic  action  is  also
supported, as long as  it  has  a  positive  effect  on  the  South  African
economy. The MF strongly feels  that  the  involvement  of  all  sectors  in
devising such a strategy is necessary to pursue new ideas  and  satisfy  the
industry. Furthermore, the involvement of Government as a driving  force  is
supported.
The MF sees the committee's efforts as remarkable, and  is  disappointed  by
the low level of participation by the business sector. [Applause.]

Mr D LOCKEY: Chairperson, I rise to  speak  in  support  of  the  Integrated
Manufacturing Strategy report. Much has been achieved over  the  past  eight
years in transforming our  economy  from  a  resource  based,  isolationist,
protectionist and crony  capitalist  economy  into  one  that  is  flexible,
responsive and globally competitive.

Thanks to the efforts of our  Government,  we  are  beginning  to  reap  the
benefits of the structural changes that were brought about after 1994.  Last
year a staggering 56% of total exports were  high-tech  manufactured  goods.
An example of this is catalytic converters, where  a  total  of  R9  billion
worth of converters were exported in 2001.

In 1991 we were a net importer of vehicles and components worth R3  billion.
Last year, we were a net exporter of vehicles and parts worth R3,4  billion.
The IDC, last year, invested in 515 projects worth R9,3 billion,  more  than
double the figure for the previous year. These projects created 20  000  new
jobs and accounted for export earnings of R10,5 billion.

The IMS sets out broad objectives of an industrial strategy. It  states  the
key priorities for a future development path, and outlines the role  of  all
economic stakeholders in the realisation of this plan. It accepts  that  the
state must play a role in co-ordinating and creating  the  conditions  under
which we can achieve higher levels of growth and development.

South Africa has many competitive advantages  when  compared  to  developing
countries. We have the cheapest electricity in the world; the  cost  of  our
land is extremely competitive compared to other developing countries and  we
have  an  excellent  legal   system,   a   sound   financial   and   banking
infrastructure. Furthermore, the cost of skilled labour in this  country  is
very competitive compared to other developing countries. We also have  duty-
free and quota-free access to the two largest markets in the  world,  namely
the EU through the Trade Co-operation and  Development  Agreement,  and  the
USA through the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act.

Above all, we have a Government  that  is  committed  to  working  with  all
stakeholders in the economy to ensure investment,  growth  and  development.
Many South African companies are now  doing  excellent  business  throughout
the continent and the world, because of the efforts of our  Government.  The
growth in our export sector bears testimony to this.

The key objective of the IMS  is  to  build  on  our  achievements  and  our
competitive strengths. Its vision is to achieve a restructured and  adaptive
economy that will ensure growth, employment and equity, built  on  the  full
potential of all our people and our regions.

The IMS hopes to achieve this by an equitable geographic  spread  of  social
and productive investment, an integrated  manufacturing  economy  with  high
levels of value added to our natural resources,  a  telecom  and  technology
infrastructure that will support and enhance  our  production  processes,  a
high level of knowledge and technology capacity  amongst  our  workforce,  a
greater diversity of enterprises  and  services;  a  skilled,  economically,
literate and adaptable entrepreneurial class, and an  efficient,  supportive
and responsive state structure that can serve  the  needs  of  all  economic
stakeholders.

The vision of the IMS is  to  build,  enhance  and  improve  South  Africa's
competitiveness in the global economy, and  simultaneously  to  develop  the
underdeveloped parts of our economy in order to realise  our  people's  full
potential. The realisation of these objectives is vital  for  future  growth
and development in our economy.

Today the global economy is  characterised  by  constant  innovation  and  a
relentless drive to produce cheaper yet high quality goods. Any  country  or
business which fails to meet these ever-increasing demands has no chance  of
surviving the impact of globalisation in the medium to long term.

The longer the restructuring of economies is  postponed,  the  more  painful
the events or transition will be. The only way  to  meet  these  demands  is
through innovation and an increase in knowledge intensity in all spheres  of
economic activity. The objective must be to work smarter and to  co-ordinate
markets in order to  produce  synergies  between  different  businesses  and
industries. The IMF clearly highlight these requirements.

The second and equally important  though  more  daunting  challenge,  is  to
develop the  underdeveloped  parts  of  our  economy  -  to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty. This is vital to ensure that we stabilise our  country
socio-economically and that  our  economy  reaches  its  optimal  levels  of
development. Unless this is achieved, our current experience  of  low  rates
of  growth,  declining  savings   and   investments,   poor   research   and
development, and falling levels of formal employment will persist.

A leading financial institution, after intensive  market  research,  divided
the South African population into the following market segments. In the  top
four percent, they found the reapers. These are the supporters  of  the  DP,
who have relocated their investments into dollar and  sterling  investments.
Below that,  there  is  the  seven  percent  that  they  classified  as  the
builders.  This  is  the  backbone  of  the  economy  responsible  for   all
entrepreneurial endeavours and investment. Below them, they found  the  nine
percent which they classified as the evaluators. These are  the  people  who
save and are financially independent. Below them they found  the  11%  which
they classified as the  participants.  This  is  the  upper  working  class,
people who have formal employment. The problem with  this  segment  is  that
these people have too much debt. Below  the  participants,  they  found  the
entrants. These are the lower-income groups in the working  class,  who  are
also in too much debt. A staggering 20% are  what  they  classified  as  the
outsiders. These are the people who are involved in the informal sector.  At
the bottom of this  pyramid,  they  found  the  subsisters.  These  are  the
unemployed and those who live without any real economic participation.  They
are outside the mainstream of the economy.

There  is  a  remarkable  correlation  between  the  categorisation  of  the
subsisters and the level  of  unemployment  in  South  Africa,  as  well  as
findings by the DTI about the percentage of our people who live in  absolute
poverty in South Africa. For as long as almost half of our  population  live
outside the mainstream of our economy, there will be serious constraints  to
economic growth and development.

These social and economic inequities also pose a real  threat  to  stability
in our country over the medium to long term. No democracy is sustainable  in
the long term if the  majority  of  the  electorate  is  excluded  from  the
mainstream of the economy. I think this is one of the most  salient  lessons
that one can learn from the Zimbabwean experience.
The IMS has recognised a need for greater equity, and  its  key  performance
indicators are growth, competitiveness, black  economic  empowerment,  small
business development, employment creation, geographic equity in  the  spread
of investment and economic activity. No one in this Chamber can  argue  that
these are not the fundamental challenges that confront our economy today.

The achievement of these key performance indicators in vital in the  process
of building a strong and sustainable economy  in  South  Africa.  The  state
must lead the process in creating greater levels of equity.  The  IMS  hopes
to achieve these levels of equity through new offerings of small  and  black
businesses, partnership programmes and a nonstatutory BEE advisory council.

The IMS also highlights the need to address the barriers that SMMEs face  in
our economy as a priority that must be dealt with. The  Government  must  do
more through procurement, subcontracting and outsourcing to ensure  that  we
build a vibrant and sustainable entrepreneurial class  amongst  historically
disadvantaged individuals. We must also begin to focus on  other  dimensions
of empowerment.

Thus far there has been a disproportionate emphasis placed on  black  people
controlling  companies  in  our  economy.  There  are  other  dimensions  of
empowerment that we need to examine. We need to look at management  training
and  involvement  by  historically  disadvantaged   individuals   in   large
corporations in this country, joint ventures and partnerships, and  what  is
happening in the liquid fuels industry is a wonderful example  of  what  can
be achieved through joint ventures and partnerships.

We also need to look at greater involvement of communities. There  are  many
businesses operating in communities that can do a great deal to assist  them
to become part of the mainstream of the economy. We need to look  at  skills
development and skills transfer. Not enough is taking place in  this  field.
Many private businesses can do more to stimulate small  businesses  in  this
country by allowing small black business to do part of the procurement.
Finally, we  need  to  look  at  corporate  social  investment.  Many  large
corporations are making a lot of money in this country. Anglo  Platinum  has
made R10 billion profit in this financial year. One needs to ask:  What  are
these people doing through corporate social investment  projects  to  ensure
that we assist those people outside the mainstream of the economy to  become
part of it?

I just want to make concluding remarks about investment  patterns  and  FDI.
All research that I have examined has pointed to  the  fact  that  investors
are either resource sitting or market sitting. We  will  only  attract  high
levels of investment if we learn to utilise  our  competitive  strength  and
resources optimally. We can  only  achieve  this  through  the  building  of
effective partnerships between all our economic stakeholders.

This is the clear intention under  the  IMS.  Once  we  have  achieved  high
levels of sustainable economic growth for South Africa and  our  region,  we
will see high levels of foreign direct investment flowing into this  region,
in response to such market development and growth.

As the ANC we support the IMS as a  comprehensive  action  plan  to  address
South Africa's microeconomic challenges. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, let me begin by  addressing
the important issues raised by the hon Nigel Bruce. I am pleased that he  is
still here. I think he is correct: the  balance  between  state  involvement
and markets lies at the very core of successful economic policy. It  is  for
this  reason  that  I  would  like  to  remind  members  exactly  what  this
Government has done in  regard  to  economic  policy,  because  I  am  quite
certain that there is no party in this House that would  disagree  with  the
basic approach that we have  taken.  This  means  that  on  the  economy  we
should, in this country, be able to unite very solidly indeed,  to  build  a
new economy.

One could describe our economic policy as having  three  essential  pillars.
Firstly, there is a need for a state that is capable of decisive  action  in
the national interest; a state that is capable of  mobilising  resources  to
bring about structural and social change; and a state  that  is  capable  of
giving  decisive  leadership  to  the  actors  in  the  private  sector,  in
collaboration with them. That is what we have stood for  and  what  we  have
done.

Secondly,  we  believe  that  it  is  essential  that  certain   fundamental
structural changes should take place in this economy, because if  that  does
not happen our society  and  our  polity  will  not  be  sustainable.  These
changes pertain to the representivity of all races in employment,  ownership
of assets, the role of women and gender in our society, and the  redress  of
the rights of certain critical natural resources. I will come back to  that.


Thirdly, we believe that there must be efficient  and  competitive  markets.
These are fundamental to the operation of the economy. If  we  do  not  make
these changes, we will not be a sustainable democracy or society.  So  those
are the three pillars - a strong state, a belief in structural  change,  and
efficient and competitive markets.

Now, we have acted on all three of these consistently  for  the  last  eight
years. We have brought about markets in agriculture,  used  markets  in  our
fiscal management more frequently, brought about a more  active  Competition
Commission, etc. As members know, we have changed the water laws and are  in
the process of changing the mining laws.

No one who has the economic interest of South Africa at heart  can  possibly
defend the existing mining law. There is no one in their right mind who  can
do that. It is a form of rand seeking which  restricts  the  functioning  of
the economy.  We  are  not  attacking  property  rights  or  investors,  but
bringing about a fundamentally correct economic change within this  economy,
as we did with agriculture and the water law.  We  are  bringing  about  the
balance that I spoke about, and this is critical.

So, our policies are consistent. Redlining is  not  necessarily  a  rational
response. It is equally possible that it is collusive abuse of power. So  we
believe in efficient markets. We will bring about structural change  and  be
a decisive state. I believe that all of us can share  that  vision  and  co-
operate on this matter.

Finally, let me say  that  with  regard  to  the  recommendations  that  the
committees made, I would like to thank members very much. I sincerely  value
the hard work done by all members of those committees. This is an  extremely
important and valuable input into the policy-making process.

We are trying to address what members have indicated  in  certain  areas.  I
think the IDC, in its submission, undersold its role  in  small  and  medium
enterprises.  It  has  had  an  important  impact  through  its  franchising
programme and currently has a very important impact through its support  for
tourism and agro-industry.

With regard to the CSIR, as members know, we are about  to  release  a  more
developed research-in-development strategy  with  the  Department  of  Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology.  The  approach  to  research-in-development
cannot be a simple one. It is not going to be only  in  corporates,  but  is
going to be a tiered approach. I believe that we will have a very  important
approach there.

With regard to gender, I am pleased to announce that, as  many  members  may
know,  today  we  launched  the   SA   Women   Entrepreneurs'   Network   in
Johannesburg. I believe that this will  have  an  important  impact  on  the
ability of women entrepreneurs to have  an  impact  on  this  society.  This
complements  our  technology  for   women   in   business   programme,   the
microlending programme and a range of other programmes designed  to  improve
women's participation in the economy at all levels. [Applause.] Can I  thank
the House for supporting the strategy?

Let me conclude by saying, once again, in the sincerest way I possibly  can,
that I am absolutely convinced that every party sitting in  this  House  can
accept as being fundamentally correct the basic tenets of economic policy  I
have just spelled out. We should  be  working  together  to  build  a  great
nation and a great economy. We have the ability to do so.  If  we  fail,  we
will be stupid. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF JOINT MONITORING COMMITTEE ON IMPROVEMENT OF
 QUALITY OF LIFE AND STATUS OF CHILDREN, YOUTH AND DISABLED PERSONS - VISIT
                               TO EASTERN CAPE

Mrs M S MAINE: Chairperson, hon members, it is indeed a great honour to  the
young people in our country - and the hinterland of  the  Eastern  Cape,  in
particular - that the debate on this crucial report to our Parliament  takes
place towards the end of the month of the youth, a  sector  of  our  society
whose role in the liberation of our  country  and  people  will  forever  be
celebrated by many generations to come.

The debate takes place 20 days after  International  Children's  Day,  which
our Parliament observed with the seriousness it deserved  by  profiling  and
paying undivided attention on the rights of the child - a  white  child,  an
Indian  child,  a  coloured  child,  an  African  child,  a  child  with   a
disability, rich and poor alike; indeed, a microcosm of our society.

We table the report in this august House at a time  when  our  country,  our
people and all of  progressive  humanity  are  gearing  themselves  for  the
International Day of the Disabled in the next five months and two weeks,  on
3 December 2002.

The youth, disabled persons and children of our country  yearn  for  freedom
from poverty, hunger and homelessness, and an end to the lack of  access  to
education and training. They yearn for a full human  rights  culture,  where
they can grow and develop with dignity,  peace  and  in  equal  brotherhood,
without any prejudice and atmosphere, upon the fruition of which shall  rise
a truly rainbow nation.

The only appropriate procedure for dealing with the challenges  facing  this
marginalised  sector  of  our  society,  namely  the  youth,  children   and
disabled, is to appreciate our past, coupled with an  unwavering  commitment
to leave no stone unturned in creating a better life for them.  Surely  this
will remain an empty dream if it  is  not  underpinned  by  the  clarity  of
vision.

We are proud that at no time in the history of country and  its  people  did
the future hold as much hope for the youth,  children  and  disabled  as  it
does today. In dealing with and confronting the challenges of the  time,  we
do so in a vacuum, inspired and enriched by the legacy of the  struggle  for
the poor and the disadvantaged, which we unleashed with great distinction.

In pursuing our mission, we derived strength and clarity of vision from  our
forbearers, the likes of Comrades Oliver Tambo, Moses Kotane and others.  It
is Oliver Tambo who, more than 15 years ago, declared to the white  minority
regime and the international community that ``a nation that does  not  value
its youth deserves no future''. Oliver Tambo was  articulating  and  shaping
the vision that enjoins us today as we tackle  the  many  challenges  facing
our youth, a vision that places in no  uncertain  terms  the  responsibility
for the positive upbringing of our youth in the hands of society.

The appropriateness of the ANC's call for Letsema and Vuk'uzenzele  -  which
encourage volunteer action in reconstructing and developing our country  for
a better life for all - is inspired by this vision, where the state  creates
an enabling environment of partnership  with  communities,  to  realise  the
ideals of reconstruction and development. It places  the  responsibility  of
guidance squarely in the hands of society, for the  positive  upbringing  of
our youth.

Clearly, in pursuit of building a better life for all,  our  Government  and
Parliament have not been found wanting in mainstreaming  the  challenges  of
the youth, the disabled  and  children.  Our  Government  has  adopted  many
international instruments  that  oblige  it  to  prioritise  the  issues  of
children, the youth and persons with disabilities. Laws  and  policies  with
concomitant structures aimed at improving the  lives  of  the  sector  under
discussion have been put in place and are, indeed, in full swing to  realise
the anticipated goals.

The former President, Nelson Mandela, said in his address  to  the  National
Assembly in 1999, and I quote:


  Because the people of South Africa finally chose a profoundly legal  path
  to their revolution, those who framed and enacted  the  Constitution  and
  other laws are in the vanguard of the fight for change.

It is in this legislature that the instrument had been fashioned  to  create
a better life for all. It is here that  oversight  of  Government  has  been
exercised. It is here that our society, with all its formations, has had  an
opportunity to influence policy and implementation.

Our visit to the Eastern Cape must  be  understood  within  the  context  of
oversight in creating an enabling environment for popular  participation  in
the national effort for reconstruction and development. We  did  not  go  to
the  Eastern  Cape  to  police  the  implementation  of  the  policy,   like
bureaucrats.

Our task  was  to  check  whether  policies  and  programmes  agreed  to  by
Government were being implemented and to assess the impact of  our  policies
on the lives of young people, the disabled and children. In doing  that,  we
integrated  an  aspect  of  building  consciousness  and  capacity  in   our
beneficiaries to monitor policy and utilise Parliament as  a  true  tribunal
of the people to be real architects of their own development.

Our committee's task to monitor and evaluate progress  with  regard  to  the
improvement of the quality of life and status of  the  youth,  children  and
persons with disabilities was fulfilled during the course  of  our  tour  to
the  Eastern  Cape.  We  liaised  with  service  providers  like  Government
departments and their beneficiaries, either  through  direct  exchange  with
them or through their representatives. Our people  were  inspired  to  learn
that  whatever  difficulties  they  might  have  in   their   midst,   their
representatives are more than serious, not only to pass  laws  and  allocate
resources on their behalf, but more importantly, to keep the  executive  and
state organs on their toes for appropriate and effective spending  of  those
resources.

We not only identified deficiencies in the system and structures,  but  more
importantly, also advised relevant  authorities  on  appropriate  mechanisms
and steps to improve the levels and quality of service  delivery.  With  our
predisposition to the national policy  and  legislation-making  environment,
we  were  able  to  make  decisive  interventions  on  many  fronts  through
persuasion.

We prioritised the Eastern Cape because it has a committee similar to  ours,
though with some variations, and because it has the highest  poverty  level.
We made this choice out of our affinity to the poorest  of  the  poor.  What
became glaringly apparent  is  the  lack  of  synergy  between  implementing
structures and systems between provinces and the  national  Government.  For
instance, the issue of children is still a welfare issue delinked  from  the
centre, which is the Premier's Office.

It is our view that  issues  of  disability,  the  youth  and  children  are
fundamental policy issues of strategic priority to our Government,  so  much
so that they cannot be relegated to a department as they are  cross-cutting,
hence their correct location in the Presidency. As we  did  in  the  Eastern
Cape, we take this opportunity to call  on  all  provincial  governments  to
locate these issues in the offices of the premiers.

The issue of the delivery  of  social  services  still  remains  a  problem,
despite policies and resources we have  allocated.  We  witnessed  instances
where offices which should provide disability grants were not accessible  at
all. Linked to this was the problem of lack of transport infrastructure  for
people who live in the remote rural areas.

Whilst there is commitment on the  part  of  the  provincial  government  to
improve  the  quality  of  service  to  our   people,   the   Eastern   Cape
administration is still saddled with personnel who are  lacking  in  a  good
work ethic and are at worst,  corrupt.  This  is  a  matter  which  requires
urgent attention. This should  be  understood  within  the  context  of  the
legacy of the bantustan administrations, where corruption was the  order  of
the day.

As we present this report, we also take the opportunity to salute the  young
people of our country - the Eastern Cape in  particular  -  who,  under  the
banner of  the  ANC  Youth  League,  established  a  volunteer  youth  corps
movement to mobilise young people behind  Vuk'uzenzele  and  Letsema.  These
youth  corps  have  rendered  door-to-door   campaigns   to   mobilise   and
conscientise communities to enrol children for child support grants and  the
disabled for disability grants. We hope that this campaign will address  the
backlog in the registration  of  beneficiaries  for  this  important  social
grant.

I  rise  to  present  this  report  for  adoption  by  this  august   House.
[Applause.]

Mr V C GORE: Mr Chairperson, hon members, I will concentrate on  my  obvious
passionate interest, because I cannot walk across the floor to  the  ANC.  I
will remain with the  DA.  My  obvious  passionate  interest  is  disability
issues, while my colleague, the hon Da Camara, will  focus  on  those  areas
affecting children and the youth.

Disability by form, function and description is difficult to  define.  There
are physical, mental and hearing impairments  that  affect  over  5  million
South Africans. The effect is predictable. It begins with  misunderstanding,
develops into marginalisation and  culminates  in  blatant  and  destructive
discrimination. As can be seen from this report, the problems that  confront
the disabled individual are immense  and  diverse.  Allow  me  to  take  hon
members on a  journey  to  illustrate  the  barriers  that  disabled  people
encounter, just  to  become  contributing  members  of  society  and  active
members of their communities.

The beginning must surely be assistive devices such as wheelchairs,  hearing
aids and canes. They are the primary tools for disabled persons'  existence.
Without them, we would continue to witness horrific incidents  of  mobility-
impaired people being degraded and humiliated  by  being  pushed  around  in
wheelbarrows. If the disabled person now has a wheelchair or a hearing  aid,
let us move on to the next step.

Disabled people have in the past suffered under -  and  continue  to  suffer
from  -  a  substandard  and  ineffective  education  system,  despite   the
excellent preparatory work done in this regard to address  this  problem  by
the hon Minister Asmal. The process needs to be accelerated, to ensure  that
disabled youth are given  the  necessary  tools  to  venture  out  and  find
meaningful employment. The disabled person now has his assistive device  and
the necessary skills: what next?

Accessibility not only refers to the traditional aspects such as  ramps  and
hearing signs but, equally importantly, to  how  the  disabled  person  gets
from his or her home to a place of  work,  whether  by  car,  taxi,  bus  or
train. The current practice by  municipalities  of  purchasing  one  or  two
accessible buses per fleet and by  taxi  operators  of  double-charging  for
wheelchair  users,  as  well   as   inaccessible   trains,   are   certainly
unacceptable and the new ``Group Areas Act'' for the disabled community.

Because one is disabled, one is told to live and work in  particular  areas.
If by some miracle - and let me assure those members who have  not  been  to
the Eastern Cape or been in the position I have found  myself  in,  that  it
can only be described as a miracle - a disabled person manages  to  overcome
all of these obstacles, the biggest hurdle he or she will then  face  is  in
the workplace itself.

Attitudes and mindsets of employers continue to restrict the development  of
the disabled person. There can be no better example than the  South  African
Parliament. Claims that this is a people's Parliament are only true  if  one
is able to walk, see and hear. Disability issues are simply given a  cursory
glance and enough attention in order to be brushed under  the  carpet.  This
Parliament has no right to  pass  legislation  forcing  other  employers  to
abide by certain conditions, if it  cannot  itself  achieve  even  the  most
basic standards.

In conclusion, there can only be one way forward in this regard:  disability
rights can only be human rights. If disabled South Africans  are  to  become
active and contributing members of our society, they must be empowered  with
the necessary skills and tools to  do  so.  Barriers  must  be  removed  and
mindsets and attitudes must change. Disabled people can no longer be  viewed
as people with disabilities, incapable of doing things, but must  rather  be
viewed as people with different abilities capable of doing anything  society
allows them to do. [Applause.]

siyazithatha  lezi  zindawo  zabo.  Zonke  izifundazwe  njengoba  sengishilo
zinakho ukuba nalezi zinkinga, akusiyona i-Eastern Cape kuphela.
Okunye,  savakashela  isikole  esithile   esasinabakhubazekile.   Kabaxhaswa
muntu,  basebenzisa  izimali  abazithola   ngokukhokha   kwabazali   neminye

kuyo  isikole.  Lokho-ke  kwasithokozisa  kakhulu.  Ngakho-ke  sibakhulekela
ukuthi bathole neminikelo eminingi ezokwazi ukuthi iyobasiza.

Mangincome ukuthi kukhona  imboni  eqasha  abantu  abaningi  abakhubazekile,
ikakhukazi imboni yokwakha  izimoto.  Lapha  sathola  ukuthi  iqashe  abantu
abaningi abakhubazekile. Lokho sakushayela  ihlombe  ukuthi  impela  bahamba
ngokwemigomo yale Ndlu yokuthi  abantu  mabaqasheke.  (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson and august House, I would like  to  start  off
by focusing on the topic that our committee deals with - the committee  that
caters for the youth, children and the disabled.

To me, all of these people  are  our  children:  the  youth,  children,  the
disabled, husbands or grandchildren - it could  be  anybody.  They  are  all
people who should be near our hearts.

I would like to state that the function of this committee is to monitor,  as
was mentioned by the hon member Maine,  who  opened  this  discussion.  That
means that it has to check whether or not tasks are  performed.  It  has  to
examine whether the national Government  does  its  work  of  looking  after
these three groups. It  also  has  to  examine  whether  or  not  provincial
governments do those things and whether municipalities cater for those  that
I mentioned above.

Our committee visited the Eastern Cape and it was led  by  its  chairperson,
Maine, and the hon member,  Henrietta  Makopani.  I  nearly  attributed  the
chairmanship to her while in fact she was our Whip during  that  period.  It
is thus a pleasure for me to be part of this debate  regarding  the  Eastern
Cape report because the findings are applicable to other provinces as  well,
including those that we have not yet visited.

The IFP focuses on human  rights  principles  which  are  based  on  caring,
ensuring that one looks after  one's  neighbour  as  one  would  look  after
oneself without criticising and looking at one's personality or  at  whether
one is humble, poor  or  disabled.  It  focuses  on  ubuntu,  which  informs
everyone that one is a person through others. In Nguni, we say a  person  is
a person through others. We also say that even if one has  blemishes,  one's
family still loves one. Also, God's word says, ``Allow the children to  come
to me''. That means that children are invaluable and we  should  look  after
them.

During our trip, we noted the extent to which those things that we  observed
dealt with ubuntu  and  focused  on  caring  for  the  youth,  children  and
everyone  in  that  province.  What  we  observed  was  that  in  terms   of
educational arrangements, the schools were not ready. The  school  buildings
were not suitable for wheelchairs. I have already  mentioned  that  what  we
observed is not restricted to the Eastern Cape but is  applicable  to  other
provinces. The teachers are not adequately trained to understand  that  they
should be able to work with the disabled in those schools.  Are  they  ready
for that? All those are things that need to be taken care of.

In many buildings, including the legislature,  there  are  no  parking  bays
that are reserved for the disabled, so that while I was in  the  company  of
two hon members, there was  no  area  with  the  sign  of  a  wheelchair  to
indicate where they could park. Such parking spaces did not exist.  That  is
not limited to the Eastern Cape, it is also prevalent in other areas.

I would like to focus more on that matter and  mention  that  the  issue  of
parking spaces really makes one sad because  we  have  noted  that  it  also
extends to shopping complexes. When there are six parking  bays,  one  finds
that they are occupied by able-bodied drivers who do not want  to  make  way
for those who should be using that space.  They  should  make  way  for  our
children, grandchildren and  the  people  who  are  supposed  to  use  those
reserved parking bays. Such actions make our children  suffer.  They  cannot
park their cars in places that are far from the designated areas  while  we,
the able-bodied, occupy their parking spaces. I have already mentioned  that
all provinces have those problems. The Eastern Cape is no exception.

We also visited a certain school which had disabled learners. They  are  not
sponsored. They rely on fees from parents and donations. They have  found  a
site on which they are going to build a school. That made us very happy.  We
therefore pray for them so that they will  get  more  donations  which  will
assist them.

I want to commend a car factory  which  employs  many  disabled  people.  We
found out that it employs many disabled people.  We  really  applauded  them
for that because we felt that they were functioning in accordance  with  the
principles of this House of creating opportunities for people so  that  they
are employed.]

At this point in time I want to mention the  problems  that  we  identified.
One of the questions  that  we  asked  was  whether  the  premier  had  been
informed about the  lack  of  co-operation  from  the  department.  Problems
identified were, one, lack of capacity in  the  office  to  co-ordinate  and
monitor these policies; two, lack of a provincial strategy to implement  the
programme; three, delays by the  Departments  of  Education  and  Health  to
establish a disability  unit;  four,  unavailability  of  sufficient  funds;
five, ineffective interaction with the premier; six, lack  of  co-ordination
of rural development, which is close to our  hearts;  seven,  no  disability
audits have been conducted within  the  Government  department;  and  eight,
lack of understanding of the reason for the Office being placed  within  the
premier's office.

Our recommendations were: one, that the provincial Action Plan for  Children
be relocated to the premier's office; two, that budgets be allocated to  the
programme so  as  to  enable  it  to  function  properly;  three,  that  the
Integrated National Disability Strategy be provincialised to ensure that  it
responds to the immediate needs of disabled people.

If I may pause here, I just want to mention that it  would  be  helpful  for
these provincial programmes and funds to be monitored by provinces.

Uma ngingase ngisheshise ngisho ukuthi  kubuhlungu  kabi  ukubukela  laphaya
abantu besuka emakhaya bengenazo izinto zokuhamba, bethwalwa ngamabhala  uma
beya emholweni ngoba izimoto zingakwazi ukufika  laphaya  phansi.  Amatekisi
ayabadlula uma bebona ukuthi bazothatha indawo  eningi,  uzothatha  izihlalo
ezimbili umuntu eyedwa. Ngakho-ke izimoto azilungiselelwe ukuthi  zingakwazi
ukuthwala  abantu  abanalezi  zidingo.  Esikhala  ngakho  ukuthi   mabakwazi
ukunakekeleka ikakhulukazi ezintweni zokuthutha.  Izinto  zokuthutha  azikho
esimeni ngaphandle kokuthi umuntu aze aqukulwe. Akakwazi ukungena  nge-wheel
chair ahlale  ebhasini  noma  etekisini  lize  limbeke  kuleyo  ndawo  ngoba
akulungiselelwe lokho.  (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[I would like to state briefly that it is very  sad  to  see  people  making
their way from their homes without proper means of transportation. They  are
loaded onto wheelbarrows when  they  go  to  collect  their  pension  grants
because cars are inaccessible. The taxis just do not bother to pick them  up
if the driver thinks that they are going to take up more space -  two  seats
for one person. Vehicles should therefore be built in such a way  that  they
can transport people who have  such  needs.  We  appeal  that  those  people
should be taken care of, particularly when it comes to  transport.  Vehicles
are not accessible to such people and they  have  to  be  hoisted  up.  They
cannot get onto a bus  or  taxi  or  travel  to  their  destination  because
vehicles have not been designed to accommodate them.]

The IFP supports  the  report  and  also  recommends  that  such  visits  be
extended to other provinces. [Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Chairperson, colleagues, I want to start off by  saying  that
the role of this committee is provided for in terms of the  Joint  Rules  of
Parliament, Rule 132(d). We have  the  task  of  monitoring  and  overseeing
probably the three most  important  sectors  in  our  society,  to  evaluate
whether we are making progress with reconstruction and development  in  this
country with regard to children, youth and people with disabilities.

As hon members have heard,  there  was  motivation  for  our  visit  to  the
Eastern Cape at various levels. What have emerged from the  report,  as  hon
members heard from colleagues of mine earlier, are some stark realities.

I want to start off by highlighting not the problems and weaknesses that  we
identified but the  recommendations  that  the  committee  has  made.  These
recommendations reflect not only  on  the  work  of  this  Joint  Monitoring
Committee, but also that of Parliament in its entirety.

The recommendations reflected in the  report  include  the  following:  One,
that the name and status of the Standing Committee on Youth, Gender and  the
Disabled  in  the  Eastern  Cape  legislature  be  changed  to  reflect  its
importance; two,  that  the  provincial  plan  of  action  for  children  be
relocated to the premier's office; three, that budgets be allocated  to  the
programme so as to enable it to function properly; four, that the Office  on
the Status of Persons with Disability be staffed immediately to ensure  that
it is well-equipped to respond to the needs of disabled people;  five,  that
the Integrated National Disability  Strategy  be  provincialised  to  ensure
that it responds to the immediate needs of disabled  people;  six,  that  an
awareness  campaign  led  by  the  standing  committee,  inclusive  of   the
Department of Education, be  established;  seven,  that  amendments  to  the
promotion of youth affairs be fast-tracked; eight, that  the  amendments  in
the above-mentioned recommendation must  include  the  implementation  of  a
reduction in the number of commissioners the  province  in  their  terms  of
office; nine, that the restructuring of the provincial Youth  Commission  be
accelerated; ten, that the role of the premier's  office  be  emphasised  to
public servants serving in that office,  and  that  the  standing  committee
explain to them their political responsibility; eleven,  that  the  standing
committee concentrates on implementation and allocation of  budgets  to  the
programmes it is responsible for; twelve, that  the  standing  committee  no
longer deals with junior officials but with heads  of  departments  in  that
province;  and  thirteen,  that  the   standing   committee   monitors   all
departments, not only the ones closely linked to it.

All this sounds familiar, because we  sometimes  face  the  same  challenges
here at national level. The Joint Monitoring Committee sometimes  faces  the
very same challenges in terms of the seriousness with which it is  taken  by
Parliament, other parliamentary committees and our national departments  and
relevant portfolio organisations.

I mention this simply because if we as a committee  dealing  with  children,
youth and people with disabilities are not taken  seriously  by  departments
and other committees, then none of these recommendations are going  to  mean
anything. We would have wasted our time visiting the provinces.  However,  I
know that in the committee we agitate and moan and groan, but we do so  with
good intentions.

I want to thank Mrs Joyce Witbooi, who  is  now  being  transferred  to  the
Western Cape legislature, for having gone on the study tour. I did not  have
the pleasure of going on the  study  tour.  I  am  therefore  not  going  to
attempt to give anecdotal references out of the report. I would be lying  to
hon members if I attempted to do that.

However, the report makes it very clear, and I would  urge  all  colleagues,
especially the hon members from the Eastern Cape,  please  to  examine  this
report and see the methodology that we adopted and figure out, in their  own
provinces, how they can improve the quality and status  of  children,  youth
and disabled people in their provinces. [Applause.]

Mr M I MOSS: Chairperson, I dedicate this speech to the disabled  people  in
our country and in memory of Steven Grové, a  former  member  of  Parliament
from Mpumalanga who is not with us anymore. He passed away at the  beginning
of this year. With June being the month of the youth,  I  also  dedicate  my
speech to the young  people  of  our  country  and  the  disabled  youth  in
particular.

As stated in the report, this is the first of many  provincial  visits  that
the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status
of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons undertook.  The  decision  to  visit
the Eastern Cape was based on the fact that they have a  standing  committee
similar to the one we have here  in  Parliament,  ie  the  joint  monitoring
committee, and to meet with the people  in  the  Office  of  the  Status  of
Disabled  People  to  establish  a  working  relationship  and  monitor  the
programme and policy implementation of the  Integrated  National  Disability
Strategy.

We encountered many problems  and  the  sad  part  is  that  many  of  these
problems have not been resolved. In the same breath,  I  have  to  say  that
there is  a  willingness  and  commitment  to  address  these  problems  and
obstacles, and improvements have already been made in this regard.

The Eastern Cape, being one of the poorest  provinces,  is  faced  with  the
huge task of addressing  the  needs  of  the  disabled  adequately,  not  to
mention the fact that resolving the problems is in itself a task  that  will
take many years. But work in this regard has started.

During our visits we encountered  immediate  problems.  At  the  legislature
there is a ramp that leads  into  the  building.  But  on  our  way  to  the
committee room where we met, I had  to  be  picked  up  and  carried  in  my
wheelchair. There was only one person working in the Office  of  the  Status
of Disabled People.  Because  the  inaccessible  building,  the  person  was
isolated and had no physical access to the office of the  premier.  A  staff
member has since been assigned to this person and there is now  much  better
co-operation than there was before we went to the Eastern Cape.

At the time of our visit  many  pensioners  and  disabled  people  were  not
getting the grants that were due  to  them.  Because  of  problems  such  as
corruption and ghost pensioners, many disabled people who were eligible  for
grants had their grants discontinued. As a  result,  many  of  these  people
took the provincial government to court to restore their right of access  to
the grants that were discontinued.  The  court  ordered  that  the  disabled
people be reinstated in the system. The Government further  decided  to  pay
back the arrears by making R2 billion available in this regard.

In line with the call made by the President on 8  February  2001,  where  he
called for justice for all vulnerable  groups,  including  disabled  people,
the  Deputy  President,  in  Port  Elizabeth  on   the   occasion   of   the
International Day of the Disabled on 3 December last year, shared  with  the
audience an experience he had had during a visit to  a  rural  area  in  the
Western Cape. He came across a physically  disabled  person  and  wanted  to
know from the  officials  present  why  that  person  was  not  getting  his
disability grant. He was told that the person was not on the system  and  it
would take some time before he could get the grant due to him.

The Deputy President told them that  he  could  see  for  himself  that  the
person was physically disabled: what did he  still  need  to  do  to  get  a
grant? The Deputy President said that he  demanded  on  the  spot  that  the
person be given a disability grant.  Within  a  week  that  person  got  his
disability grant, and even the arrears were paid to him. [Applause.]

The Monday after the International Day of the Disabled my colleague  sitting
there, Joe  Mzondeki,  was  contacted  by  many  disabled  groups.  The  hon
Mzondeki is the chairperson of the Federal Council  for  the  Disabled.  The
council, together with the Department of Social Development, co-operated  to
form an assessment panel that deals with and addresses the backlog of  those
who were denied grants.

A disabled doctor in the Eastern Cape offered  to  assist  by  offering  his
services. The Eastern Cape province also  implemented  a  programme  whereby
public  buildings  were  converted  to   become   disabled-friendly.   These
buildings include hospitals, clinics and schools, which is where people  get
their grants.

We came across a problem at the hospital where the ramp  was  wide  and  big
enough for a wheelchair, but too small for a stretcher,  which  is  used  to
transport patients in and out of the hospital.  The  unemployed  youth  were
targeted to do the jobs of converting  these  buildings  and,  in  the  same
process, jobs were created and their skills were developed. The  above  were
all in line with the  President's  call  in  the  Vuk'uzenzele  and  Letsema
campaigns.

The ANC instructed its  members  and  branches  to  go  full  out  in  their
communities and constituencies to ensure that any  person  who  is  eligible
for a grant or pension gets it. Further good news which  emanated  from  our
visit to the Eastern Cape is that the MEC for Housing committed  himself  to
the principle of public participation by involving disabled  people  in  the
housing project. The disability desk in the Premier's Office is now part  of
a project management scheme that will comply with the required standards  to
ensure that 5% of all houses to be built in the province will  be  disabled-
friendly.

We also visited institutions for the youth and disabled persons. In  Cradock
we visited a multipurpose centre which  was  built  with  the  help  of  the
provincial youth commission. It was fully utilised  by  the  youth  for  the
various programmes, to enhance their skills.

The Tsolo Special School for the Mentally Disabled  was  also  visited.  The
vision of this school is to raise  the  level  of  self-esteem  of  mentally
disabled children through education  and  training,  as  well  as  practical
skills. Through its mission statement, the school is  committed  to  working
in partnership with all stakeholders, to ensure that each  learner  receives
the best possible education. The school also experiences its fair  share  of
problems,  such  as  a  shortage  of  staff,   lack   of   electricity   and
accommodation.

As part of our oversight and monitoring  role,  as  members  of  Parliament,
this visit enriched us and gave us a better understanding of how to  further
engage our constituencies and communities on the ground.

My kollega Vincent Gore aan die  ander  kant  van  die  Huis  het  'n  goeie
toespraak gelewer, maar waarmee ek nie met hom saamstem  nie,  is  die  feit
dat hy sê: Daar is baie min in hierdie Parlement gedoen. Ek was 'n  raadslid
voordat ek 'n LP geword het, maar ek kan nou sê dat ek hier  ten  minste  in
my eie stoel sit. Ek hoef nie opgetel te word om in enige  komitee  te  gaan
sit om deel te neem aan gesprekke nie. [Applous.] Ons regering het  'n  baie
goeie beleid daargestel vir gestremdes. Dit tel  onder  die  bestes  in  die
wêreld. [Applous.]

Daar is ook 'n afdeling gesetel in die Kantoor  van  die  President  wat  'n
duidelike indruk skep dat die  Regering  is  ernstig  om  die  lot  van  die
gestremdes aan te spreek.  Die  gestremdes  het  byvoorbeeld  selfs  'n  eie
Minister wat ook 'n teken is  dat  die  Regering  ernstig  is.  Daar  is  'n
spreekwoord wat sê dat mens by die huis begin.  In  ons  Parlement  het  ons
baie gestremdes - die meeste van  alle  parlemente  in  Afrika,  inteendeel,
selfs die meeste ter wêreld. Baie van ons gestremde lede hier het baie  werk
gedoen as gestremdes. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[My colleague, Vincent Gore, on the other side of  the  House,  delivered  a
good speech, but I do not agree with what he said when he stated  that  very
little was done in this Parliament. I was a councillor  before  I  became  a
MP, but I can now say that at least I am sitting in my own chair here. I  do
not have to be picked up in order to go and sit in  any  committee  to  take
part in discussions. [Applause.] Our government has developed  a  very  good
policy with regard to disabled people. It is amongst the best in the  world.
[Applause.]

There is also a department in the Office of  the  President,  which  clearly
indicates that the Government is serious about addressing the plight of  the
disabled. Disabled people even have their own Minister, for  example,  which
is also a sign that the Government is serious about this issue. There  is  a
saying that one must start at home. In our  Parliament  we  have  a  lot  of
disabled people - more than any other parliament in Africa,  actually,  even
the most in the world. Many of our disabled members here have done a lot  of
work as disabled people.]

Kunzima kubantu abakhubazekileyo phaya ngaphandle, kwindawo  abahlala  kuzo.
Akukho   zindlela   zakuhamba   abantu.   Nezithuthi   azibancedisi   abantu
abakhubazekileyo.  Kambe  namhlanje,  siyakwazi  ukuthi  uRhulumente   wenze
imithetho ethile encedisana nabantu  abakhubazekileyo.  Ke,  le  yimisebenzi
emihle  eyenziwe  nguRhulumente.   Ngoko   ke,   ndiyayamkela   le   ngxelo.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Disabled people experience problems out there where they live.   There  are
no roads. The modes of transport that they use do not consider the needs  of
the disabled. But, today we are proud to say that the Government has  passed
some laws that are aimed at assisting disabled people. This is indeed,  some
of the good work that the Government has accomplished. Therefore, I  welcome
this report. [Applause.]]

Miss O N MNDENDE: Madam Speaker and hon members, I firstly  wish  to  remind
this House that poverty is estimated to affect 22  million  people  in  this
country. This is a staggering and horrifying state of affairs. At  times  it
is difficult to picture this for oneself when sitting  in  this  House.  For
that very reason, it is vital that members of Parliament  go  on  visits  to
experience, first hand, the conditions that our people are living under.

It was, therefore, very  important  that  this  committee  should  undertake
visits such as these, since it is, sadly, the case that children, the  youth
and people with disabilities are often the first  and  greatest  victims  of
poverty. As it is, the Eastern Cape is known to be the poorest  province  in
the country and, therefore, the issues I have raised above  with  regard  to
this report are of particular relevance there.

I would like to highlight some of the  problems  and  weaknesses  that  were
identified by the committee during its visits. The Office of the  Status  of
Disabled People made a presentation to the committee. The problems which  we
identified were as follows: lack of capacity in the OSDP to co-ordinate  and
monitor policy; lack of a provincial strategy to  implement  the  Integrated
National Disability Strategy; delays at the Departments of Education and  of
Health  to  establish  a  disability  unit;  and  the   nonavailability   of
sufficient funds.
I do not want to repeat the problems and weaknesses identified  by  all  the
stakeholders during our visits. I  believe  that  the  above-mentioned  list
provides a good example of the type of issues at stake here.

Somlomo, ezi ngxaki sithetha ngazo apha, ukuba  siyaqonda,  sofumanisa  into
yokuba ziingxaki esithi sizibone zisenzeka  ezidolophini.  Umbuzo  ke  ngoku
ngowokuba xa ezi zinto zisenzeka ezidolophini, kubeka phi ezilalini?

Sele zithethile ke izithethi ebezingaphambili ezifana nohloniphekileyo  uMnu
Moss. Siyeva ukuba ngoku kuthethwa ngeerempu ezingekhoyo phaya  ezidolophini
nasezibhedlele,   kwanangeelifti   ezingasebenziyo.    Kambe    ke,    umntu
wasezilalini akazi kwaloorempu naloolifti kuba kaloku ezi zinto  azikho.  Xa
izinto  zimaxongo  ezidolophini  kubeka  phi  ezilalini?  Ngathi  ke   ngoku
kufuneka khe sibe ngathi sitsala iintambo phaya ezilalini.

Zithethile  izithethi  ebezingaphambili   zithetha   ngezitulo   ezinamavili
ezingekho ndleleni.  Kuba  kaloku  iindlela  zinezigingqi,  kwa  eso  situlo
sinamavili asikwazi kusebenza  ezilalini.  Ukuba  ubani  uyaya  ezilalini  -
kufuneka siyile kuba kaloku indaba yotyelo ayikholi -  uya  kuqaphela  ukuba
kusetyenziswa izileyi  xa  kufuneka  kuthuthwe  abantu  abangakwazi  kuhamba
ukuze baye kwamkela inkamnkam.  Bakhweliswa  ezileyini  nasezikiriveni  kuba
kaloku ayikho enye indlela yokubasa kwiindawo ekwamkeliswa kuzo inkamnkam.

Ngaba singamalungu  ePalamente  sithini  ngale  meko?  Masikhe  simke  ngoku
siyishiye idolophu siye phaya ezilalini. Nabo bakufutshane  nedolophu  bathi
babe nazo ezi zitulo zinamavili,  ubani  uya  kufumanisa  ukuba  esi  situlo
asikwazi kwa ukuphuma apha eyadini yasekhaya kuba  kaloku  kukho  izigingqi,
akukho zindlela. Kufuneka siyijonge yonke loo nto leyo.

Usizi lwento kukuba nokuba sebede bayifumana inkamnkam aba  bantu,  kufuneka
ukuba bethabathe  kwakule  mali  baqeshe  iinqwelo-mafutha  iistallion  baye
ezidolophini baye kutshintsha iitsheke. Bathi ke  bapakishane  ngemva  kwezi
nqwelo-mafutha, becutha kule mali, kuba kaloku kunyanzelekile ukuba  baqeshe
inqwelo-mafutha ukuya edolophini nokubuyela  ezilalini.  Ubani  angafumanisa
ukuba naloo mali bathi bayifumane ithi iphume apha phakathi kweminwe.

Yiyo ke loo nto ndisithi  makhe  siye  phaya  ezilalini,  siziyeke  iingxaki
zasezidolophini kuba noko zona zingcono, siye kujonga ukuba asithethi  lwimi
bangaluqondiyo na xa  sithetha  ngeerempu,  izitulo  ezinamavili,  neelifti,
njalo njalo. Sithetha isiGrike kubo kuba ezi zinto abanazo.

Yiyo ke loo  nto  ndisitsho  ukuba  makhe  sishiye  idolophu  sibheke  phaya
ezilalini  kuba  kudala  sithetha.  Abantu  banxunguphele  phaya  ezilalini,
basithela nqa xa sisithi iimeko zingcono. Kambe noxa kunjalo, siyavuya  kuba
siyawubona  umahluko.  Ngoko  ke   i-UDM   iyayixhasa   yonke   le   ngxelo.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows)

[Madam Speaker, the problems we are talking about here, it will be  noticed,
are problems that we see  in  urban  areas.  If  these  problems  are  being
experienced in cities, how much more acutely are they experienced  in  rural
areas?

Speakers like the hon member Mr Moss have already spoken. We hear  that  now
there is talk about ramps that  have  not  been  erected  in  towns  and  at
hospitals, and about lifts that are out of order. Persons who live in  rural
areas do not know about ramps and lifts because there are no such things  in
their areas. If we say things are bad in towns, how much worse are  they  in
rural areas? I think we should pull up our socks and  work  even  harder  in
rural areas.

Speakers before me spoke about wheelchairs. Because  roads  are  uneven  and
full of potholes, even those wheelchairs would not work in rural  areas.  If
one were to visit rural areas - we should go on  visits  because  seeing  is
believing - one  would  notice  that  people  use  sleighs  as  a  means  of
transport for people who are unable to walk to pension pay points. They  are
being transported on sleighs and wheelbarrows  because  there  is  no  other
means of transport to pension pay points.
As members of Parliament what do we say about this situation? Let  us  leave
towns and go to rural areas. Even the people who have wheelchairs  and  live
nearer to towns have difficulty even getting out of  their  yards  in  those
wheelchairs because of potholes. There are no roads. We should  really  look
at this.

It is sad that even those who have received  their  pensions  have  to  hire
transport, like stallions, to take them  to  town  to  cash  their  cheques.
People are packed into the back of these vans,  reducing  what  little  they
had even further because there is no other means  of  transporting  them  to
towns from their homes. It is not uncommon to find that in the long run  all
their money has been spent before most of their needs have been met.

That is why I say that we should visit rural  areas  and  find  out  whether
people do understand when we talk about ramps and wheelchairs and lifts  and
so on, and leave towns and cities for a while  because  their  problems  are
not as great. When we talk about these things to them we might  as  well  be
talking Greek, because it is totally new to them.

That is why I suggest that we pay visits to  rural  areas  because  we  have
been doing too much talking. People in rural areas  are  anxious,  we  leave
them wondering when we say that things are better. Even though it  might  be
the case, we are glad somehow because we can see the difference.  Therefore,
the UDM supports this report. [Applause.]]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, the report has thrown some  light  on  the
quality of life of certain groups of people in the Eastern Cape.  Given  its
status, as the poorest province in the country, it is  even  sadder  as  one
reads the reports about a  low  level  of  service  commitment  from  public
officials.

The report mentioned instances where people took the initiative  to  make  a
difference in their communities.  One  such  group  is  the  five  women  of
Masiphathisane club who got together to fight  poverty  in  the  area.  They
started out with one sewing machine and a monthly  contribution  of  R60  in
order to build up  capital.  They  subsequently  received  a  donation  from
Government which they used to buy two more machines. Their  aim  is  not  to
rely on hand-outs but to support their business  through  the  profits  that
they make. Although they were struggling, they showed courage  in  order  to
continue.

This is an example of the care-giving spirit of people who, irrespective  of
the odds stacked against them, will seek to change the environment. What  is
sad, however, is their inability to sell the things  that  they  make.  That
means, in other words,  that  the  initiatives  started  by  people  do  not
usually translate into satisfactory rewards. This seems to  be  one  of  the
contributing factors that impact on the living standards of  the  people  in
the Eastern Cape.

The greatest problem within the province is the  inability  to  provide  and
sustain infrastructural support. The lack of interest and  moral  commitment
from Public Service officers imply that many of  the  concerns  that  affect
the disabled, children and the youth remain unattended to.  President  Thabo
Mbeki has recently intimated that urgent  assistance  to  the  Eastern  Cape
must enjoy priority.

The report has shown that there are institutions that desire to improve  the
lives of people in the region. All they lack are the  basic  resources,  co-
operation from provincial officers and a sustainable service  to  take  care
of minor maintenance work and repairs.

Regarding the report of the summary of the response of the  MEC  for  Social
Development to the issues raised by the committee, the  MEC's  response  was
simply not  encouraging.  There  is  no  indication  in  the  response  that
meaningful changes can be  expected  in  order  to  raise  service  delivery
standards. If one can read anything into that response, the province  is  in
a far worse position than can be measured.  There  is  an  urgent  need  for
greater leadership and vision, which are required to get  the  province  out
of the sad state that it is in.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members,  the  Constitution  of  this
country makes it  very  clear  that  no  person  should  be  treated  in  an
unbecoming manner. But, on  a  regular  basis,  we  experience  difficulties
which are encountered by people who fall in the category  of  children,  the
youth and disabled persons. Issues such as reaching for  the  working  level
of an ATM, let alone the usually high counters of banks, place these  people
at a disadvantage all the time.

The visit by the committee to the Eastern Cape brought  to  light  that  the
province needed guidance in a number of  areas.  The  committee  also  noted
that the province was hard put  to  interpret  some  legislation  passed  by
Parliament. We feel that there  is  a  need  to  visit  other  provinces  on
similar fact-finding missions.

That the province is one of the most impoverished is not  in  dispute.  That
there is a higher level of illiteracy in the  province  is  not  in  dispute
either. But, the appointment of officials who lack an understanding  of  the
situation in the premier's office, has to be frowned  upon.  The  Office  of
the Premier has to take the lead in all Government initiatives.  The  policy
of Batho Pele has to be just that, ie  service  to  the  people.  This  high
office should be staffed with high calibre officers who have a  passion  for
their work.

The recommendations made by the committee have  to  be  heeded,  implemented
and   constantly   monitored,   particularly   the   one   on   popularising
mainstreaming in education. We are in full support  of  the  recommendations
that emphasise  the  devolution  of  powers  to  the  provinces  on  matters
relating to these vulnerable groups of people. After  all,  problems  around
children can be resolved locally.

The UCDP supports the adoption of this report.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, we are aware of the conditions  that  people
live in. Government is working  hard  to  correct  and  change  that.  South
Africa, as in the rest of Africa,  has  not  been  spared  the  ill-fate  of
poverty. Our visit to the Eastern Cape made that quite clear.
Poverty exists like an epidemic and eats at our people. It keeps  them  from
development, advancement and, most importantly, a better  life.  Illiteracy,
poor living conditions, ill-health and underdevelopment are  but  a  few  of
the calamities that we found the Eastern Cape to be suffering from.

Shocking conditions left us dumbfounded with the  reality  that  an  earnest
need to address community needs was far more urgent  than  we  had  thought.
The actual visit  and  ability  to  be  part  of  the  entire  Eastern  Cape
situation made the reality even more immediate. It was horrific to  see  the
hardship,  conditions  and  lack  of  services  those  people   live   with.
Disability projects have  not  been  monitored  as  a  result  of  financial
constraints.

The  MF  recommends  that  the  Government  should  earnestly  address   the
situation in order to assist this area as a matter of urgency.  However,  it
is noted that this need for urgent assistance and poor standards  of  living
are experienced throughout South Africa. There is a need for us to  pull  up
our socks and address the needs in our areas more  efficiently.  That  is  a
must. Our Government is trying its best to improve the lives of our  people,
especially the disabled.

We have just completed the discussion of Votes. Hopefully,  the  allocations
for resources for better living standards will be utilised  effectively.  It
is hoped that a great improvement will be  noticed  on  our  next  visit.  I
believe that that is in progress now.

The MF supports the adoption of this report. [Applause.]

Mr S L DITHEBE: Madam Speaker, hon  members,  I  rise  in  support  of  this
report on the Eastern Cape, in respect of the terms  of  reference  referred
to by previous speakers.

Our report is a sign of determination to hold the executive accountable  and
to tell no lies and  claim  no  easy  victories,  but  to  expose  lies  and
difficulties wherever they are found. This we do in order to hold  ourselves
accountable in our undying  quest  to  lend  a  hand  in  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty and creating a better life for all.

I now turn to children and the youth of our country who continue to  benefit
directly and indirectly from child  support  grants  and  pensions  for  the
aged. The President and the Minister of Finance announced earlier this  year
an allocation of R2 billion to cater for unpaid grants  over  an  indefinite
period of time, and increases of R20 and R50 respectively. We are,  however,
accurately  conscious  of  the  obstacles,  which  are  infrastructural  and
administrative, that are faced by some  of  our  people  in  areas  such  as
Butterworth, at pay points.  This  point  has  been  mentioned  by  previous
speakers.

However, there are other success stories in this second poorest province  of
our country, such as the Cradock multipurpose youth  centre  which  is  well
equipped and should be optimally utilised to promote  multiskilling  of  our
youth. To that end, we call on the Umsobomvu Youth  Fund,  in  collaboration
with the National Youth Commission and the  Eastern  Cape  provincial  youth
commission,  to  preserve  that  centre  as  the  Umsobomvu  Youth  Fund  is
preparing to announce the  winner  of  the  R40  million  youth  development
centre's tender sometime this year.

It is also encouraging to note  that,  in  a  recent  report  on  disability
equity in the South African Public  Service,  the  Eastern  Cape  provincial
government was one of those that responded on time  to  the  research  which
was  conducted  by  the  Public  Service  Commission,  regarding  disability
equity. This will provide all our provincial and national  departments  with
an opportunity to  review  their  contribution  to  national  targets,  with
regard to disability equity.

The Eastern Cape now stands to benefit from the findings of  that  research.
Those  findings  were  recently  made  available  to  our  Joint  Monitoring
Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and Status  of  Children,  Youth
and Disabled Persons. Allow me to quote briefly from the  key  findings,  on
page 10, of the summarised disability equity report of  the  Public  Service
Commission. I am quoting on the key findings regarding skills development:


  Past  educational  policies   and   empowerment   practices   served   to
  discriminate against people with disabilities. The resultant  impact  has
  been a poor development of the  skills  base,  making  it  difficult  for
  people with disabilities to compete for employment. That has led  to  the
  fact that the true potential of people with disabilities is not realised.

Further, in its progress report of March  2002,  the  Department  of  Social
Development revealed that it had conducted a  pilot  project  in  which  the
youth of King William's Town  benefited  from  the  Fundulwazi  life  skills
centre. I would like to quote from the findings of that report. It says  and
I quote:


  The department has successfully piloted the youth development  Fundulwazi
  life skills centre in King William's Town,  Eastern  Cape.  The  centre's
  adolescent development programme has an approximately 80% success rate in
  integrating youth in communities and diverting them from  getting  deeper
  into the criminal justice system and preventing school dropouts.

It goes on to say:


  The life skills centre model in King William's Town has  been  replicated
  in the Eastern Cape, North West, Northern Cape and Gauteng.


  Within these centres life-skills training, family preservation and  youth
  mentoring are approaches used  to  facilitate  the  revival  of  cultural
  values and address social challenges experienced by young people, such as
  substance abuse, the breaking up of family relations, crime and  dropping
  out of school.


  The majority of graduates proceed to do skills training  or  go  back  to
  school. Others are assisted to continue studies  at  technikons  and  the
  rest are employed at the job creation project.

These are some of the highlights that I have referred to, and I said at  the
beginning of my speech that I would do so in the quest to tell no  lies  and
claim no easy victories.

Some of the speakers have, unfortunately,  chosen  to  become  the  Rip  van
Winkles of this world; to sleep and close their eyes, preferring to  see  no
progress, no achievements and nothing good. The hon  Moss  has  referred  to
this already. In this Parliament, on a number of occasions last year and  in
previous years  -  and  even  this  year  -  when  we  passed  the  Vote  of
Parliament, we made very passionate pleas with regard to the improvement  of
services for people with disabilities, and Parliament has responded.

We have seen the improvement of facilities for people with disabilities.  I,
myself, have witnessed many  members  of  Parliament,  regardless  of  their
party-political affiliation, coming to the instant assistance of any of  the
members of Parliament with disabilities whenever  they  are  stuck  anywhere
within the precincts of Parliament. I would, therefore, like  to  appeal  to
the hon Gore to realise that it does not do our country any good  to  prefer
to close our eyes even to the good things that are done by our Government.

I would like to concur, however, that there are many  limitations  which  we
face, not only in the Eastern Cape, but also in other provinces. It  is  for
this reason that I agree with  the  hon  Mbuyazi  that  the  report  on  the
Eastern Cape must not only be seen as a postmortem on  the  Eastern  Cape  -
probably in an attempt to prove that its governance has failed  -  but  must
also be understood in the context of our  quest,  as  the  Joint  Monitoring
Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life of Children, Youth and  Disabled
Persons, to visit eight other provinces.

Because of budgetary and  time  constraints,  we  are  unable,  so  far,  to
undertake more than three visits per annum.  Be  that  as  it  may,  we  are
committed to doing our oversight work, and wherever  limitations  are  found
in any of these provinces, we are prepared to expose them  so  that  we  can
hold ourselves accountable for improving the lives of  our  people  in  this
country.

I would like to say that we must also remember that the Eastern Cape is  one
of the provinces that have a bantustan legacy. We have  also  referred  here
to the findings of the Public Service Commission with regard  to  disability
equity. Having said that, I know that some of the members might  be  tempted
to say that we seem to be inclined to blame everything on the  past,  ie  on
colonialism, apartheid, etc.

However, the past or that legacy, to the extent that it  is  still  with  us
today in the form  of  the  deficiencies  and  limitations  referred  to  by
previous speakers and this report of the Public  Service  Commission  in  as
far as people with disabilities are concerned, is very relevant, because  we
must know where we come from in order to be able to redress  the  imbalances
of the past. Those imbalances emanate from the past.

The ANC is committed to solving - and  quite  conscious  of  -  the  immense
difficulties and challenges that we face in the Eastern  Cape  and  in  many
other provinces. These are the  challenges  we  face  in  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty.

Problems  were  referred  to  by  members  with  regard   to   people   with
disabilities and able-bodied people who are not able to access  pay  points,
etc. I  am  quite  happy  that,  generally,  we  are  all  agreed  that  the
challenges referred to by members constitute the challenges that we face  as
a country and we need to do something about this.

If there is corruption, it will be this Government of  the  ANC  which  will
expose it, as we witnessed in the recent case of the acts of  corruption  in
the Grootvlei Prison in Bloemfontein. Government did not shy away from  that
and, as I said at the beginning of my speech,  we  will  tell  no  lies  and
claim no easy victories. We will expose lies and difficulties wherever  they
are found.

I think if anybody in this House is  still  under  the  illusion  that  this
Government does not care  about  exposing  corruption  or  if  they  have  a
different source of  information,  I  must  inform  them  that  it  is  this
Government that is exposing acts of corruption. [Applause.]  Of  course,  we
are dealing with them. We do not have to be reminded to do so.

I would also like to commend the Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development, which has decided, together with Unicef and Cedaw, to  print  a
very user-friendly booklet  for  our  children  entitled  ``These  are  your
Rights''. This is a very simplified version of  the  UN  Convention  on  the
Rights of the Child. We have been informed that these booklets will be  made
available to all children in the  32  000  schools  across  the  length  and
breadth of our country. [Applause.]

Children in the Eastern Cape  also  stand  to  benefit  from  knowing  about
instruments such as the  UNCRC,  the  African  Charter  on  the  Rights  and
Welfare of Children and, indeed, section 28 of our Constitution, which  puts
children first.

I am quite content that the trip  to  the  Eastern  Cape  has  exposed  many
challenges which we have heard about,  even  when  the  President  undertook
imbizos in three provinces of our country. These are challenges we dare  not
shy away from.

On behalf of the ANC, we support this report. We are intent  on  rolling  up
our sleeves and ensuring that we actually meet  the  challenges  of  undoing
all the wrong things that have been done. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

         Bill, subject to proposed amendments, passed  by  National  Council
         of Provinces on 21 June 2002 and transmitted for  consideration  of
         Council's proposed amendments:


         (i)     Probation Services Amendment Bill [B 18B - 2002]  (National
              Assembly   -   sec   75)   (for   proposed   amendments,   see

              686).


         The Bill has been referred to the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Social
         Development  of  the  National  Assembly  for  a  report   on   the
         amendments proposed by the Council.


     (2)    Resolution of  the  Legislature  of  the  Northern  Province  to
         request  Parliament  to  change  the  name  of  the  province  from

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     (1)    First Report of the  Working  Group  on  the  African  Union  on
         Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic  Community
         relating to the Pan-African Parliament, dated 20 June 2002:


         The Working Group on  the  African  Union,  having  considered  the
         request for approval of the Protocol  to  the  Treaty  Establishing
         the  African  Economic  Community  relating  to   the   Pan-African
         Parliament, recommends that the House, in terms of  section  231(2)
         of the Constitution, approve the said Protocol.


         The Working Group reports further, as follows:


         (i)     The Protocol provides that, while the ultimate aim  of  the
                 Pan-African Parliament is to  evolve  into  an  institution
                 with full legislative powers, at this stage the Pan-African
                 Parliament will only have consultative and advisory powers.
                 Currently there is no constitutional conflict  between  the
                 provisions of the Protocol and those of the  South  African
                 Constitution.


                 However, once legislative powers have been granted  to  the
                 Pan-African Parliament, there may be  a  need  to  consider
                 amendments  to  the   Constitution   and   other   domestic
                 legislation.


          (ii)     Parliament  should  as  soon  as  possible  consider  the
                 procedure and criteria for the composition of  the  members
                 to be designated for the Pan-African Parliament.


         (iii)   The Joint Subcommittee on the Parliamentary  Budget  should
                 make provision for South African participation in the  Pan-
                 African Parliament.


         (iv)    The Working Group will proceed with identifying aspects  of
                 the Protocol to be addressed through the Rules of Procedure
                 of the Pan-African Parliament.


         (v)     The Working Group will begin to give consideration  to  the
                 proposed Rules of Procedure for the Pan-African Parliament.

3.    Report of the Portfolio Committeee on Housing on Visit to  Mpumalanga,
     dated 7 November 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Housing, having undertaken a study  tour  to
     Mpumalanga, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         A multi-party delegation from the Committee undertook a study  tour
         to Mpumalanga from 30 September to 3 October 2001. The  delegation,
         under the leadership of Ms N E Hangana, consisted of  five  members
         and two officials, viz: Ms P Coetzee-Kasper (ANC), Mr G  Schneemann
         (ANC), Mr W Skhosana (ANC), Mr B  Dhlamini  (IFP),  Mr  D  G  Mkono
         (UDM), Ms A-M Jojozi and Ms K Pasiya.


     B.      Objectives of visit


         1. To fulfil its monitoring and oversight function,  the  Committee
              intended to establish progress  made  with  the  "Housing  the
              Nation" programmes.


         2.  To  have  an  exchange  of  views  and  experience   with   the
              Legislature, Mayors of different areas, local  ward  councils,
              contractors and developers.


         3. To tour to  various  housing  projects,  such  as  the  People's
              Housing Process, Rural Housing Projects, Hostel  Redevelopment
              Projects, projects developed by women  and  other  inner  city
              developments.


         The delegation  visited  six  projects  in  different  municipality
         areas. On the first day, the delegation met with the MEC,  Mr  M  S
         Ginindza. He provided a brief outline of the future  plans  of  the
         Department to ensure that the poorest of the poor will be  provided
         shelter.  The  tour  included  meetings  with  the  Mayors  of  the
         different municipalities. Projects visited included visits to  low-
         income housing projects, a hostel project, a middle-income  housing
         project  and  a  People's  Housing  Process.  Officials  from   the
         Department accompanied the delegation, as well  as  the  Provincial
         Director, Mr S G Sono, and the Head of Department, Ms G N Sibeko.


     C.     Briefing by MEC and HOD


         Maximum participation by the people in  improving  their  lives  is
         very important. In the process of building houses, the poor  should
         be assisted financially. In the past the focus has been on  getting
         developers and contractors to build houses for the poor. The  focus
         now is on ensuring that beneficiaries themselves contribute to  the
         building  of  their  own  houses.  Training  is  provided  to   the
         unemployed  in  different  communities.  Training  is  provided  in
         respect of different skills so as to try and improve the  state  of
         affairs in South Africa.
         The RDP houses cost  R16  000  per  unit  and  the  Department  has
         determined that houses built should not  be  less  than  40  square
         metre. The Department is now focusing on ensuring that  the  houses
         built are of good quality and are sustainable.


         In the rural areas some traditional  leaders  have  approached  the
         Department  and  requested  that  houses   be   built   for   their
         communities. They emphasised that they do not want small houses  to
         be built for their people.


         1. Housing, Land and Administration


              (a) Land has to be made  available  for  building  houses,  in
                  urban as well as rural areas. The Department  is  focusing
                  on releasing land to  build  houses  for  the  needy.  The
                  demand for houses in the rural areas  suggest  that  there
                  is indeed a need for them there.  In  Mpumalanga  some  of
                  the  mud  houses  cannot   withstand   the   heavy   rains
                  experienced in summer. Some of the land in rural areas  is
                  held in trust by Chiefs and  the  Department  of  Housing,
                  Land and Administration. Projects will be given  tentative
                  approval where land is a question. Land  availability  has
                  been slow due to the slow pace of transfer  of  land  from
                  tribal state land to municipalities.


              (b) The Department is unable to upgrade title deeds as quickly
                  as it would want to because the budget allocated for  that
                  purpose is inadequate.


              (c) The budget amount allocated for 2001-02 will be  spent  as
                  budgeted for, as the Department is managing  its  projects
                  quite well. In 2000  the  focus  was  more  on  addressing
                  administrative issues. In 2001,  the  focus  has  been  on
                  delivery. Most of the projects have been  delivered,  even
                  those delayed due to the unavailability of land.


              (d) In 1999, the Department conducted an intensive review  and
                  discovered that housing delivery  has  been  urban-biased.
                  The Department is at present attempting to  address  this,
                  but has not yet reached all rural areas.


              (e)  The  Department  does  approach  sister  departments  and
                  requests them to assist  in  providing  services  such  as
                  water, schools, clinics, etc, whenever houses  are  to  be
                  built in a  particular  area.  The  Department  of  Social
                  Development is also playing  a  big  role  in  respect  of
                  Intergrated Social Housing.


              (f) The Department is trying to eradicate informal settlements
                  by building houses in  areas  where  there  were  informal
                  settlements. However, in South Africa, it is difficult  to
                  remove these settlements completely, as there  are  people
                  who continue to build them.


              (g) The Head of Department meets with the Premier once a month
                  to discuss problems experienced within  the  Department  -
                  corruption experienced within the  Department,  misconduct
                  by personnel, etc.
              (h)  The  Department  has  engaged  NURCHA  actively  and  has
                  outlined a programme in conjunction with them,  with  more
                  emphasis on the saving scheme. An  action  plan  has  been
                  drafted and is awaiting approval by the MEC and  the  Head
                  of Department.  The  Department  has  assisted  NURCHA  to
                  obtain an office in the province and is willing to  assist
                  them financially. The purpose is to  introduce  NURCHA  to
                  the communities.


         2. Nkomazi Local Municipality - Tonga East


              (a) Project Profile


                  *    The project was started at the beginning of 2001  and
                       will be completed at the end of  November  2001.  The
                       local men and women are employed to build the houses.
                  *    Bricks used for building  the  houses  were  made  by
                       local people. A brick factory  has  been  established
                       nearer  to  the  project  so  that  people  from  the
                       community could be employed. 35 people were  employed
                       to make bricks for a period of six months. A register
                       of skilled people is maintained so that they  can  be
                       employed in future projects.


                  *    There are 900 stands in this  area,  and  the  houses
                       are 32 square metre in extent. Beneficiaries are from
                       34 nearby villages in the area, most of them work  in
                       Nelspruit and Johannesburg, some live as  subsistence
                       farmers and others have an informal income.


              (b) Water Supply and Electricity Installation


                  *    A water tank was being built  for  the  community  so
                       that they can access water from it, as there  are  no
                       water taps for the community.  In  the  meantime  the
                       community is accessing water from one  tap  and  each
                       household's water supply has been increased  from  60
                       litres  per  day  to  100  litres.  With  regard   to
                       electricity  installation,  the  subsidy   does   not
                       provide for electricity installation, but electricity
                       will be installed at a later stage when  the  problem
                       between Eskom and the TED has been resolved.


              (c) People's Housing Process


                  *    The Department has  initiated  the  People's  Housing
                       Process, but the process is rather slow. On 13 and 14
                       September 2001,  the  MEC  met  with  developers  and
                       discussed the designs of houses that could  be  built
                       so as  to  do  away  with  the  township  style.  The
                       proposal is that these houses be 50 square metres.


              (d) Problems experienced


                  *    Due to a lack of land availability,  the  900  stands
                       that were supposed to be built, were reduced  to  473
                       stands.


                  *    Water-borne sewage is very expensive  and  cannot  be
                       provided in Tonga East. The Department is  trying  to
                       get funds for a water-borne sewage system.
                  *    The whole community gets water from one tap, and  are
                       waiting for the reservoir to be finished.


                  *    Ventilated toilets cannot be built due to a  lack  of
                       funds.


                  *    The delegation observed  that  the  toilets  and  the
                       houses are built in such a manner that when there are
                       floods, water would flood the toilets. The Department
                       has promised to rectify this.


                  *    In some houses there are  spaces  between  the  walls
                       and the  roof.  The  Project  Manager  is  trying  to
                       rectify this problem. All the houses  have  a  three-
                       month retention clause,  which  will  kick  in  three
                       months after the houses have been built in  order  to
                       rectify and address loose top structures.  Mpumalanga
                       is the only province offering this service.


              (e) Positive features


                  *    The  local  community  was  empowered  with  building
                       skills, having been trained in  respect  of  all  the
                       work done with regard to building the structures.


                  *    The standard of living  of  the  community  has  been
                       improved, and according to the developers, they  have
                       not experienced problems from the communities.


         3. Mbombela Municipality


              (a) Kanyamazane Hostel Redevelopment Project


                  The hostel has 36 family  units,  still  being  developed.
                  The units come in two sizes -  33  square  metres  and  52
                  square metres. 30% of the project has been  completed.  It
                  is  an   emerging   contractor   that   is   involved   in
                  redeveloping the hostel. The hostel  was  built  about  30
                  years ago, and has to  be  renovated  to  accommodate  the
                  needs of the occupants  who  wanted  to  live  with  their
                  families. Only local skilled people were employed  in  the
                  project, including  women.  Most  of  them  were  contract
                  workers in different projects and did not  have  permanent
                  employment. Occupants of the hostel will  be  given  first
                  preference, and some of those employed in the project  are
                  beneficiaries.  The  project  is  executed   through   the
                  municipality.


              (b) Problems experienced


                  There is a lot  of  vandalism,  despite  security  in  the
                  hostel. Bricks, roofs and windows were  stolen;  only  the
                  foundation was left and not demolished.


         4. Albert Luthuli Municipality


              (a) Jina Housing Project - Project Profile


                  The project has been a success. The houses are  42  square
                  metres, and 500 stands were supposed to be built.  Of  the
                  500  houses  supposed  to  have   been   built,   93   are
                  outstanding. 2 500 additional  houses  still  need  to  be
                  built. The Housing Board has approved the building  of  an
                  additional 500 houses. R8 million has been set  aside  for
                  the building of these houses.


              (b) Silobela Housing Project - Project Profile


                  The area  where  the  project  has  been  built,  used  to
                  consist of an informal settlement and a greenfields  area.
                  The project was started in  1995.  Beneficiaries  occupied
                  the houses in 2000. The houses are 40 square metres.


              (c) Problems experienced


                  *     The  project  was  delayed  because  the  Department
                       delayed in paying the constructor payment due to him.


                  *    Poor people do not meet the  requirements  needed  to
                       be able to gain access to the subsidy. Some  of  them
                       are unemployed. The stands of the applicants who  did
                       not meet the requirements, are standing vacant.


                  *    Some households do not  have  electricity  and  taps;
                       those without taps use communal taps.


         5. Middelburg TLC


              (a) Background


                  *     Since  1994,  housing  projects  have  been   funded
                       through   funds   received   from   the    provincial
                       department. In the municipality of  Middelburg  4 000
                       units have been provided. 3 500  housing  units  have
                       been provided in the urban area and 500 housing units
                       in  the  rural  area.  There  is  only  one   project
                       incomplete.  The  Municipality   of   Middelburg   is
                       satisfied with the manner in which  funds  have  been
                       utilised for these  projects.  All  housing  projects
                       were done on land offered  by  the  Council  free  of
                       charge. This enabled the stands to be  built  on  big
                       erfs or units.


                  *    Currently the size of the houses built is  32  square
                       metres.   The   houses   have   water-borne   sewage,
                       electricity and installed prepaid meters.


                  *    In Middelburg there is no land  owned  by  Middelburg
                       Municipality.


                  *    There is a  backlog  of  houses  in  Middelburg.  The
                       Municipality has created an area called the Organised
                       Squatting Area. This was done to ensure  that  shacks
                       are built in one area. Services  in  this  area  have
                       been improved, roads  have  been  built,  electricity
                       provided, and toilets erected. Residents in this area
                       pay for their  services.  Those  who  do,  have  been
                       promised that they would be  given  first  preference
                       once the houses have been built.


              (b) Problems experienced


                  *    Mine owners do not want to sell mine houses to  their
                       employees. Upon retirement, mine workers do  not  own
                       houses and they end up building informal settlements.
                  *    There is privately owned land  which  the  provincial
                       Department could buy so that houses can be built. The
                       Council is unable to build houses on privately  owned
                       land.


                  *    The Municipality needs more funding  to  ensure  that
                       vacant positions within the Municipality are filled.


                  *    There are farm workers who are evicted and they  also
                       need houses. Because  there  are  not  enough  houses
                       being  built,  they  end  up  moving  into   informal
                       settlements. Most of them have their  own  houses  in
                       the rural areas and only need  accommodation  in  the
                       urban areas. In order to solve this  problem,  rental
                       stock should be made available so that people are not
                       forced to buy when they own.


                  *    There are  people  who  sell  their  RDP  houses  and
                       return to the squatter camps. This makes it difficult
                       for the squatter camps to be demolished.


         6. Greater Middelburg Housing Project


              (a) Hope City - Project Profile


                  *    The project started in March  2001  and  is  five  km
                       away from Middelburg. It is the first kind of  Social
                       Housing in Mpumalanga. The German government assisted
                       with the development of social housing in Mpumalanga.
                       A group of South Africans have attended  training  on
                       social  development  in  Germany.  The   project   is
                       financed by the Department of  Local  Government  and
                       Housing, Social Housing  Foundation  and  the  German
                       government.


                  *    One unit cost about  R61  000;  disabled  people  are
                       well catered for in the stand-alone units.
                  *    The community has supported the project and it is  in
                       demand amongst the communities. Land for the  project
                       was provided  by  the  Middelburg  Municipality.  The
                       Municipality played a big role in ensuring  that  the
                       project was a success.


         7. Briefing by Mayor of Delmas


              (a) Housing Development in Delmas


                  *    The houses that have been delivered in Delmas are  of
                       good quality. As a result  no  complaints  have  been
                       received from the community.


                  *    Land has been made available to build houses  without
                       charge.


                  *    Houses built are not less than 40 square metres.


              (b) People's Housing Process


                  *    The People's Housing Process in Delmas was  the  idea
                       of a woman from the community. The idea was supported
                       by the Council and the end product turned out  to  be
                       of good quality,  compared  to  the  developer-driven
                       process. When using  contractors,  few  local  people
                       benefit  or  are  employed.   The   developers   have
                       previously given the Council  problems.  The  Council
                       now supports the People's  Housing  Process,  because
                       developers are profit-driven.


                  *    The People's Housing Process is generally  slow,  but
                       the Council is looking at ways of ensuring that it is
                       accelerated.


              (c) Rural and urban intergration


                  *    here are people who are evicted from  the  farms  and
                       are accommodated in Delmas. Of those evicted from the
                       farms, 70 families now live  in  squatter  camps  and
                       refuse to move to the township. The Council is trying
                       to  access  land  so  that  an  Agrivillage  can   be
                       established for them.


                  *    The Council is trying to establish  a  township  near
                       the hospital to ensure that people live closer to the
                       workplace.


              (d) Problem experienced


                  People still continue to build shacks  next  to  their  40
                  square metre houses. They cannot afford  to  extend  their
                  houses.


         8. Gomasakho Housing Project - Delpark Ext 2


              The size of the houses are 40 square  metres,  and  there  are
              about 1 817 stands. The houses do not have electricity.


         9. People's Housing Process


              (a) Botleng Ext 3 - Project Profile


                  This project was initiated by a woman from the  community.
                  It has proved to  be  the  best  project  in  Delmas.  The
                  houses were built  by  the  beneficiaries  themselves  and
                  they came up with their  own  design.  The  sizes  of  the
                  houses are 50 and 56 square metres. The houses are  three-
                  roomed and have toilets inside the house,  a  big  passage
                  and two doors leading outside.


                  It is obvious from the size and quality of  the  PHP  that
                  it is the best process, as  it  is  people-driven  and  as
                  beneficiaries take ownership of  the  houses.  The  houses
                  are of good and solid quality.


                  The beneficiaries of these  houses,  when  interviewed  by
                  the delegation, were  grateful  to  the  government.  They
                  mentioned that when  they  lived  in  shacks,  they  never
                  thought they would one day own a house.


     D.     Recommendations


         1. Houses built should be monitored properly by the  Department  to
              ensure that they are of good quality.


         2. The provincial Department should ensure that developers  do  not
              build houses that are less than 40 square metres.


         3. Communities should  be  engaged  so  that  they  participate  in
              housing projects.


     E.     Conclusion


         The Committee would like to thank and congratulate  the  Department
         of Housing and Local Government in Mpumalanga for their  commitment
         to Housing Delivery.

4.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises on Study  Tour
     to Argentina and Brazil, dated 15 May 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on  Public  Enterprises,  having  undertaken  a
     study tour to Argentina and Brazil from 14 to April  2002,  reports  as
     follows:


     I.     Background


         The government confirmed its strategic vision for restructuring  of
         state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in November 1999. This  vision  sets
         out the role of the State in the restructuring of SOEs, in view  of
         the development needs of South Africa and of  international  trends
         in SOEs restructuring. Beyond this, the President in his  State  of
         the  Nation  Address  last  year  reminded   the   government   and
         stakeholders  about  the  need  for  an  accelerated   agenda   for
         restructuring  of  SOEs.  Drawing  logical  conclusions  from   the
         President's reminder, it is therefore imperative for those  in  the
         mainstream of restructuring SOEs  to  follow  international  trends
         and perhaps adopt and adapt administrative and economic  models  or
         devices used in other countries. This can  be  achieved  by,  inter
         alia,  drawing  lessons  from  those  countries  with  respect   to
         challenges and  shortcomings  and  particular  models  utilised  by
         those countries.


     II.    Purpose


         The two countries visited, classified as developing countries  like
         South   Africa,   are   relatively   wealthy    countries.    Their
         restructuring models have served  these  countries  well.  However,
         restructuring, particularly in Argentina,  has  not  been  problem-
         free thus certain SOEs  deteriorated  and  their  poor  performance
         severely eroded confidence in the financial  sector.  The  tour  to
         the two countries  would  assist  the  Committee  in  grasping  the
         reasons for those failures so as not to repeat  them.  Essentially,
         this tour could help  the  Committee  to  familiarise  itself  with
         complexities that the other countries have  faced  and  have  dealt
         with.


    III.    Delegation


         The members of the delegation were:


         1. Mr B A D Martins, MP (Chairperson of Committee  and  the  leader
              of delegation) (ANC)
         2. Mr B M Komphela, MP (ANC)
         3. Mr R J B Mohlala, MP (ANC)
         4. Ms P N Mnandi, MP (ANC)
         5. Mr M S M Sibiya, MP (IFP)
         6. Dr W A Odendaal, MP (NNP)
         7. Mr C T Thisani (Committee Secretary)


     IV.    Argentinian leg of tour


     15 April 2002


     A.     Courtesy meeting at Embassy
         The delegation received  a  briefing  at  the  Embassy  from  Mr  T
         Nyawose, Charge d'Affaires, and Mr P Pieterse,  Trade  Attaché.  Mr
         Nyawose briefed the delegation on the current crisis in  Argentina.
         After analysing the situation in Argentina,  the  mission  came  to
         the following conclusions as contributing factors to the crisis:


         1. Pegging of peso (Argentinian currency) to dollar


              The decision by the then government of Argentina  to  peg  the
              peso to the dollar on a one-to-one  basis  meant  in  practice
              that  when  Brazil  (Argentina's  biggest   trading   partner)
              devalued  its  real  (Brazilian  currency)  in  1999,  foreign
              investors and buyers found their dollars  could  buy  more  in
              Brazil than in Argentina. This led to the drying up of foreign
              direct investment and buyers of Argentine exports (beef, grain
              and other agricultural commodities) could  get  more  for  the
              same price in other countries,  particularly  in  neighbouring
              Brazil.


         2. Extensive borrowing by government


              The government of President Menem (1983-99) acquired a lot  of
              debt, both  foreign  and  domestic,  particularly  during  its
              second term. This resulted in the upward spiraling of domestic
              interest rates. The more the  government  was  borrowing,  the
              more expensive credit became for  Argentine  businesses.  This
              forced many companies to close down.


         3. Failure to balance government spending with tax revenue


              Government  expenditure  on  civil  servants  is  amongst  the
              highest  in  Latin  America.  An  estimated  70%  of  the   23
              provinces' revenue is spent on salaries  for  civil  servants,
              causing deficits in the  financing  of  basic  services.  Non-
              compliance with tax  laws  -  a  combination  of  evasion  and
              arrears - is regarded as one of the causes  of  the  deficits.
              Lengthy delays in prosecuting tax evaders and poor performance
              by the tax agency have not helped to resolve the problem.


         4. Economic recession


              The extensive programme of  privatisation  undertaken  in  the
              1990s resulted in a significant  number  of  job  losses.  For
              example, employment in the railway sector fell from 90 000  to
              less than 20 000 in 1994.  However,  according  to  the  World
              Bank, productivity in this sector increased  by  a  factor  of
              seven or eight.


              As a result of the fact that most of the privatised  companies
              were public utilities, prices for such basic services such  as
              electricity and telephones spiralled upwards. This  sparked  a
              recession which grew steadily worse as domestic  demands  went
              on a downward spiral and as more companies were  compelled  to
              lay off even more people.


              The downward spiral increased  the  debt  burden  because  the
              government's tax revenues were shrinking. On  the  other  hand
              the IMF made it clear in  mid-2001  that  it  would  not  bail
              Argentina out by making an advance  payment  on  a  previously
              agreed loan, to allow the government to  make  its  next  debt
              payment. This was after Argentina had  missed  fiscal  targets
              set out in loan agreements.


              Consequently, the three problems converged to the  point  that
              there were massive capital flights, and savers rushed  to  the
              banks late last year to convert their pesos to  dollars  at  a
              one to one rate; some even began withdrawing their dollars.


              Fearing a run on the banks, the then Economy Minister issued a
              proclamation in late November last year, limiting  withdrawals
              to US$1 000 per month. The  limits  on  cash  withdrawals,  in
              turn, hurt consumer sales already battered  by  the  country's
              four-year recession.
              The limits on cash withdrawals sparked a wave  of  uncertainty
              and anger throughout the country, which led  to  protests  and
              civil  unrest  that  often  turned  violent  and  led  to  the
              resignation of two presidents in December 2001.


     B.     Implications for South Africa


         The  financial  crisis  presently  afflicting  Argentina  and   the
         resultant financial regulations and  restrictions  imposed  by  the
         Central Bank regarding payment for imports creates an  unfavourable
         environment for doing business with Argentina.


         This might lead to a decrease in the  volume  of  bilateral  trade.
         The figure in  respect  of  bilateral  trade  last  year  stood  at
         US$426,988 million  with  Argentina  importing  US$131,730  million
         worth of goods from South Africa and exporting  US$295,258  million
         to South Africa. South African exporters will find it difficult  to
         export on the  180  days'  payment  terms  and  may  have  to  seek
         alternative  markets.  The  South  African  Reserve  Bank  requires
         payment within 180 days of shipment. Argentine companies,  however,
         have to pay only 180 days of  receipt  of  goods  (200  days  after
         shipment).


         A number of South African exporters might not be paid  for  exports
         shipped to Argentina prior  to  December  2001  (payable  in  March
         2002) because Argentine importers will not be able to pay  them  at
         the new exchange rate. Meanwhile,  South  African  importers  would
         not be adversely affected by Argentine Central  Bank's  regulations
         and restrictions.


         In his response to:


         *  What happened to the proceeds from privatisation


         *  Whether quality of service has improved after privatisation


         *  Contraband activities


         *  Any way out of the current crisis


         *  Any culture of non-payment for services


         *  Reason for selling the companies back to the state,


         Mr Petersen pointed out that before  the  peso  was  floated,  many
         industries disappeared to neighbouring Brazil. Due to  the  current
         crisis it's going to take a few years before other countries  start
         to export to Argentina. Fortunately for South Africa a good  export
         base has already been established. The current  situation  resulted
         in 20% increase in contraband activities. More  people  had  access
         to public utilities and equality of service  dramatically  improved
         but due partly to a lack of money  in  circulation  and  bad  debt,
         companies could not  repay  their  creditors.  The  government,  in
         order to reduce public debt, used the proceeds from privatisation.


     C.     Meeting with Mrs M Alexander from World Bank


         Mrs Alexander and the World Bank have been involved in the  process
         of privatisation since 1990.  Before  their  involvement  Argentina
         was embroiled in a serious economic crisis. The rate  of  inflation
         was at 3 000%. The prevailing situation offered a dramatic  setting
         for privatisation to take place. Some contributing factors were:


         *  A suffocating fiscal burden on the State (8% of GDP in debt)


         *  Less or no money for basic services


         Privatisation laid the foundation for the following:
         *  Access to water was increased by $150 million


         *  Illegal electricity connections were reduced


         *  Railway locomotives were refurbished


         *  Changes Management in ports yielded better results


         *  Reduced debt burden on the State.
         However, the following problems still lingered:


         *  A need  to  create  a  sound  regulatory  framework  to  monitor
           performance


         *  Too many regulatory bodies


         *  Many companies borrowed from Europe in dollars, and the  current
           situation left them unable to pay their debt
         *  Ever-increasing demand on public service the  demand  for  water
           is huge


         *  Costly sewage collection


         *  Inability to expand rail service


         *    Privatisation   only   managed   to   improve   the   existing
           infrastructure instead of expanding it


         *  The system was dollar-based, but  it  has  now  changed  to  one
           dollar to three pesos
         *  Protracted re-negotiations on debt owed by  companies  and  cost
           structures


         *  Tariffs at the moment are too high for the poor


         *  Some companies have reneged on their debt payment agreement.


         Proposed solutions
         *  The World Bank is currently  working  with  the  government  and
           companies on tariff impacts and tariff re-engineering


         *  The government has set up a timetable for tariff adjustment


         *  Phasing-in of tariff adjustments


         *  A Commission was set up to assist the government


         *  55 contracts are to be re-negotiated


         It is Mrs  Alexander's  opinion  that  the  dilemma  faced  by  the
         companies cannot be  apportioned  to  privatisation;  problems  are
         bound to be there regardless of whether companies  are  in  private
         hands or are state-owned. She pointed out that  the  problems  were
         there for many years and every solution applied is going  to  be  a
         long-term  one.  She  added  that  for  any  economy  to   function
         relatively  smoothly,  policies  need  to  be  consistent,  but  in
         Argentina policies change almost everyday in order to come up  with
         quick solutions.


         She also stressed a need for stronger regulatory agencies.  At  the
         moment there are too many agencies  and  a  debate  at  the  moment
         suggests grouping of similar agencies.  To  illustrate  her  point,
         that  privatisation  brought  forth  more  good  than   ills;   she
         mentioned that, after privatisation, the following happened:


         *  Social spending in the government budget improved because  of  a
           reduced deficit


         *  Debt was reduced by 16%


         *  4% GDP growth


         *  Two million people more with water


         *  Number of call boxes increased from 24 000 to 81 000
         *  Number of telephone lines doubled


         *   Although  some  problems  still  persist,  people  agree   that
           services have improved


         *  Electricity tariffs are one of the lowest in the world.


         According to Mrs  Alexander,  the  World  Bank  does  not  lend  to
         companies. It only lends money to  the  government  but  there  are
         World Bank agencies that lend money to  companies. In her  opinion,
         companies in Argentina  took  on  too  much  debt  and  not  enough
         equity. She believes that in an ideal situation the poor should  be
         protected against high tariffs but in most cases  it  is  difficult
         to determine who are the poorest. In as far as best  practices  are
         concerned, she believes that they are all around the world and  can
         be copied to suit our  needs.  She  believes  that  other  factors,
         which are bigger than privatisation, played a role in  the  current
         situation in Argentina. Privatisation, she argues, improved  a  lot
         of things, but other factors such as the legal system, tax  related
         problems, lack of trust in the government, etc, cannot be ignored.


     D.     Meeting with S Kiernan - Managing Editor: Pagina 12 Newspaper


         In  his  narration  of  early  events,  Mr  Kiernan  informed   the
         delegation that the stage was set in the 1940s  when  the  Peronist
         Party started taking over companies from private sector. That  move
         did not yield any good results, for example the telephone  services
         were the worst in the world. By the  1980s  public  utilities  were
         cheap but not easily accessible. It became evident  that  companies
         were not getting enough money to be competitive.


         The  above  situation  set  a  new  stage  for  privatisation.  The
         government started an  across-the-board  privatisation  process  in
         1990. Everything from airlines, water,  rail  and  other  utilities
         were privatised. The only things that were  not  sold,  were  those
         related to state security, such as  nuclear  stations  and  weapons
         manufacturing companies. The stated interest was  to  get  capital,
         injection and to a certain degree it succeeded. To  illustrate  the
         point:


         *  There were fewer electricity black-outs


         *  New telephones were installed and suddenly almost  everyone  had
           access to telephones


         *  The Economy was doubled in seven years.


         According to Mr Kiernan, the downside of privatisation was:


         *  Privatisation resulted in people losing jobs


         *  Unemployment jumped from 12% to 24%
         *  From day one all public utilities became expensive


         *  Foreign companies paid bribes to get contracts


         *  The regulatory framework became loose


         *  Officials were easily bribed


         *  Companies refused to offer affordable  basic  services  such  as
           water and electricity; instead they were prepared to sell to the
           government at market rate. It was left to the State to cater for
           social responsibilities.


     E.     Meeting with Mr C Cirigliano - Chairperson of 'Trenes de  Buenos
         Aires'(TBA) (privatised railroad company)


         TBA  was  formed  in  1995  after  they  had  won  a  national  and
         international bid. The president of TBA  claims  that  before  they
         took over, the service was in a bad state, and that their  aim  was
         to  meet  minimum  safety  and  comfort  standards.   Their   plans
         involved:


         *  Management of 350 of rail lines


         *  Rebuilding of 96 stations


         *  Acquisition of new electric carriages
         *  Elimination of crossings between cars and rail.


         The organisation employs about 3 000 workers. After  privatisation,
         the number of  commuters  rose  to  one  million  but  due  to  the
         recession the number has decreased to 650 000.


         On the issue of road use versus rail use,  the  chairperson  argued
         that the two should not compete but rather complement  each  other,
         as is the case in the United  States.  As  far  as  the  regulatory
         framework is concerned, he argued that the  matter  is  complicated
         and the fact that laws governing regulations were passed  about  80
         years ago without being amended, did not  help  either.  A  working
         regulatory  model  is  non-existent.  There  is  no   Minister   of
         Transport  in  Argentina;  the  company  reports  to  the  national
         regulation agency.


     F.     Meeting with TELECOM (privatised telecommunication company)


         The delegation was  met  by  Mr  A  C  Sierra,  Director:  Business
         Strategy. In his briefing he outlined the following:


         *  Telecom controls the northern part of Argentina


         *  They enjoy a seven-year monopoly, extendable to 10 years


         *  The  National  Commission  on  Telecommunication  regulates  the
           industry


         *  Telecom is owned by four consortiums (employees  own  10%)  with
           seven affiliates.


         Mr Sierra informed the delegation  that  before  privatisation  the
         company was inefficient, facilities were obsolete  and  quality  of
         service  was  unacceptable.  The  company  was  also   faced   with
         operating difficulties, lack of capital investment and  no  network
         drawings.


         After 1995 the company emerged with:


          * Increased efficiency and strong profitability


         *  Increased volume of lines and better technology


         *  More capital investment
         *  Improved customer service.


         Present situation of TELECOM


         Revenue $3,049 million


         Market cap    $2,2 million


         Employees     14 453


         Fixed lines in service   3 892 000
         Cellular subscribers     2 136 000


         Internet subscribers     257 000


         Fixed network 100% digital


     G.     Meeting with Mr M Montana, National Commission of Transport


         This Commission regulates transport activities. Mr  Montana  is  an
         expert in rail transport, with 20 years in public rail.
         As it stands at present, rail is divided into four units:


         *  Metro rail


         *  Goods transport


         *  Real estate (property management)


         *  Long haul (cancelled at the beginning).


         Metro and goods services were concessioned  after  a  national  and
         international bidding process. The role of the Commission is to:


         *  Ensure that safety standards are met


         *  Eliminate conflicts of interest


         *  Monitor conditions of service.


         Mr Montana highlighted the following achievements:


         *  An increased number of commuters (50%  of  commuters  depend  on
           metro for transport)


         *  Improved customer service


         *  Low accident rate


         *  Subways runs more efficient service


         *  Comprehensive use of the infrastructure.


         On what happened to the cancelled long  haul,  Mr  Montana  pointed
         out that road and air transport had filled the  gap  left  by  long
         haul service. He added  that  there  was  a  huge  growth  in  road
         transportation. The industry does not enjoy any  subsidy  from  the
         government but fares are fairly competitive. On rail  versus  road,
         he explained that if the two are carefully planned, both  could  be
         used profitably. Rail and road should  not  run  parallel  to  each
         other; instead they should cross and converge only at the ports.


     16 April 2002


     H.     Meeting with Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises


         The chairperson of this Committee is Deputy Courel. The  delegation
         was briefed by:


         *  Mr O Junion, Head of the Water Commission


         *  Mr I de Carvalho, of Planning


         *  Mr E Fernandes, Director of Structured Products.


         Innargas Briefing


         Innargas is a  $2,5  billion  a  year  gas  producing  company.  It
         controls over 1 000 km of  gas  networks.  The  company  agreed  to
         privatisation in 1992 so as to  improve  efficiency.  The  enabling
         law was passed in 1996 and at  the  same  time  the  parliament  of
         Argentina appointed a regulatory agency. The policy  objectives  of
         the agency was to:


         *  Protect the interests of the public


         *  Promote an environment suitable for competitiveness


         *  Encourage investment


         *  Ensure fair tariffs
         *  Ensure free access to gas transportation


         *  Encourage growth and diversity in the industry.


         After privatisation the industry achieved the following:


         *  Gas production rose to 160 million cubic metres


         *  Network was increased by more than 50%
         *  Six million consumers (33% growth)


         *  Investment grew to 3 billion


         *  Technology improved.


         The Chairperson pointed out that in his opinion,  privatisation  in
         Argentina was handled in the best possible manner.


         Water Commission briefing


         A framework for water regulation was started in  the  1990s.  Among
         other things, the agency  was  tasked  to  regulate  tariffs,  curb
         widespread inefficiency and corruption in the industry  and  devise
         means to counter hyperinflation started in  the  90s.  The  targets
         against inflation were met until the  recent  crisis.  As  was  the
         case with other services before privatisation, water services  were
         under the following conditions:


         *  Low water pressure


         *  Poor quality of water


         *  High rate of water contamination


         *  Management inefficiency


         *  Low investment


         *  Service rendered not measured


         *  Few people had access to water


         *  Sewage collection was low - only one sewage plant.


         Mr Junion informed the delegation that after privatisation most  of
         the problems mentioned above were  solved.  In  addition  to  that,
         since last (2001) a social tariff was introduced. He conceded  that
         there are still lot of challenges that need  to  be  tackled,  such
         as:


         *  High levels of water loss


         *  Sewage blockages


         *  Expansion of services is at slow pace


         *  Access to water services is dropping


         *  Sewage treatment is not effected as planned.


     V.     Brazilian leg of tour


     17 April 2002


     A.     Meeting with Chairperson of Committee  on  Economy  -  Deputy  C
         Sobrinho


         Deputy Sobrinho explained to the delegation the  general  structure
         of  the  Brazilian  government  and  some  aspects  of  their   tax
         collection. Pressed to comment on privatisation, he  conceded  that
         privatisation in Brazil was not handled in  the  right  manner.  He
         said that it is his view that privatisation should have  been  slow
         and gradual.


     B.     Meeting with Deputy A Rebelo, President:  National  Defence  and
         Foreign Relations


         Deputy Rebelo expressed his views on the process  of  privatisation
         in Brazil. His assessments of the process were:


         *  Brazil undertook the largest privatisation process in the  world
           in the shortest period


         *  $120 billion worth of companies were sold


         *  The desired objectives of privatisation were never realised


         *  The poor became poorer and the rich became richer


         *  There was no  effort  to  keep  some  companies  under  national
           control


         *  In the process there was substantial capital flight


         *  Some foreign companies  decided  to  close  down  and  relocated
           outside the country


         *  Lack of profit was forcing some companies to hand them  back  to
           the State


         *  The argument for privatisation was to pay  State  debt;  instead
           debt is double what it was


         *  Service from public utilities is worse than  before,  eg  access
           to telephones has increased but expenses are high


         *  Road conditions have improved, but  this  has  not  extended  to
           other areas


         *  Cargo transportation became too high
         *  Foreign capital was preferred to local capital


         *  The regulatory agencies are ineffective


         *  Companies never  bothered  about  social  responsibilities;  the
           State still shoulders an obligation towards the poor


         *   A  lack  of  clear  accountability  lines  in  the   privatised
           companies.


         On what could have been done differently, Deputy  Rebelo  suggested
         that:


         *  Strategic information and  security  systems  should  remain  in
           State hands, eg the  satellite  system  (an  important  national
           defence-related tool) cannot be under a foreign company


         *  Local consortiums should have been formed so as to take  control
           of the privatised companies
         *  Golden share (a minimal share held by the State to  prevent  the
           company from being taken  over  by  a  foreign  country)  should
           remain with the State.


     18 April 2002


     C.     Meeting at Department of Economic Affairs


         The delegation was briefed on the whole  process  of  privatisation
         since it started to the present. The briefing went as follows:


         1. Privatisation in Brazil: 1991 - 2002


              Privatisation in Brazil has completed its eleventh consecutive
              year.  From  1991  up  to  2002,  139  Brazilian   state-owned
              enterprises and  concessions  have  been  transferred  to  the
              private sector, with results amounting to US$103,4  billion  -
              when considering all the proceeds from federal and state level
              privatisation, plus the debts transferred from the  public  to
              the private sector.


              These results show the relevance of  restructuring,  which  is
              taking place within the  Brazilian  economy,  making  it  more
              efficient, productive and competitive.


              However,  more  than  a  simple  sale  of  assets  to  private
              investors, privatisation has been part of  deep  institutional
              transformation, which included the reduction of  public  debt,
              the creation of new investment opportunities, the  stimulation
              of competition and the strengthening of market mechanisms.


              Since 1995,  the  government  has  submitted  bills,  and  the
              Congress has passed laws, aimed at modelling and  deregulating
              a number of sectors, such as telecommunications, oil  and  gas
              and electrical energy.


              The Congress has also authorised the  creation  of  regulatory
              agencies   such   as   ANATEL   (telecommunications),    ANEEL
              (electricity sector) and ANP (oil and gas), which are  already
              operating in this new environment where corporate  competition
              has replaced public monopolies.


              The Brazilian privatisation programme has been developed under
              the strict eye of  Congress,  audited  by  the  Federal  Audit
              Court, and managed by a wholly  government-owned  institution,
              BNDES  -  the  Brazilian  Development  Bank  responsible   for
              implementing  government  long-term  financing   policies   in
              Brazil.


              BNDES has also collaborated with  the  efforts  of  the  State
              governments  to  privatise  their  own  companies,   providing
              technical advice and financial support.


         2. Foreign Participation


              The first  stage  of  the  Brazilian  privatisation  programme
              focused on public sector industrial  enterprises.  This  stage
              has started with the sale of  USIMINAS  in  October  1991  and
              ended with the privatisation of one  of  the  world's  largest
              mining corporations, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), in May
              1997.


              In 1995 the programme entered its second stage focusing on the
              concessions of public services and infrastructure -  including
              oil and gas, power utilities,  railroads,  telecommunications,
              ports, highways and banks.


              When industrial enterprises were being privatised, up to 1995,
              foreign participation in total proceeds was less than 5%.


              Once privatisation of the utilities started, the  interest  of
              foreign investors in  the  Brazilian  privatisation  programme
              increased dramatically, amounting today is much as 48%!
              A great help was the  stabilisation  plan,  Plano  Real,  that
              achieved lower inflation, to the one-digit level, and  reduced
              dramatically  the  uncertainties   regarding   the   Brazilian
              economy.


         3. Privatisation in Brazil - brief retrospect


              The impressive performance of Brazilian privatisation in  1997
              and 1998 was mainly due to the sale of TELEBRáS, the Brazilian
              telecommunications system monopoly, the electricity generation
              assets  of  GERASUL  and   several   state-owned   electricity
              distribution utilities.


              In 1999, one of the most important  events  was  the  sale  of
              COMGAS, the gas distribution company owned by the State of Sao
              Paulo, which was sold for US$988  million,  at  a  premium  of
              119%. In the electrical energy sector, there was the  sale  of
              the first two of CESP's  generation  companies,  also  in  Sao
              Paulo state.


              The year also marked the opening up of the oil and gas  sector
              to private investors; the National Oil and  Gas  Agency  (ANP)
              conducted the first  round  of  concessions,  authorising  new
              players to  explore  and  develop  new  oil  and  gas  fields.
              Presently, around 67 fields have already been conceded.


              In November 2000, the Central Bank successfully privatised the
              Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo, Banespa.  The  buyer  was  Banco
              Santander Central Hispano, with a bid 281,02% higher than  the
              minimum price, arriving at US$3,6 billion.


              Still, in 2000 the common shares of  Petrobras  that  exceeded
              government control, were sold. The shares were  sold,  through
              international public offer in the United States and in  Europe
              simultaneously,  to  a  domestic  offer  with  total  revenues
              attaining US$4,03 billion. Part of the domestic offer went  to
              312,194  individuals.  The  federal  government  remains  with
              55,76% of Petrobras voting capital.


              In 2001 the Petrobras non-voting shares owned  by  BNDES  were
              sold through a global  public  offer  in  the  United  States,
              Europe  and  Brazil.  A   total   of   41,4   million   shares
              corresponding to 3,5% of total capital were sold for US$ 806,9
              million.


              In  addition  the  Brazilian  Electricity  Regulatory   Agency
              (ANEEL) granted concessions to develop and construct new hydro-
              electric projects and new transmission lines during  the  past
              two years.


              Overall proceeds up to 24 January 2002 were  U$182,9  million.
              The amount refers to the sale of Banco do Estado  do  Amazonas
              S.A.(BEA), held on 24 January at  the  BVRJ  (Rio  de  Haneior
              stock market), acquired by BRADESCO, the only competitor,  for
              the minimum set price.


              Up to now, 139 companies and concessions have been transferred
              to private investors, with total results of more  than  US$103
              billion.


              On why other companies were not privatised, the delegation was
              informed that only those with capacity to stand on  their  own
              were privatised. Even privatised companies were not allowed to
              sell without the permission of the State; the  State  holds  a
              golden share on all privatised companies.


              The delegation met with a representative  from  the  Brazilian
              Department of Foreign  Affairs.  He  informed  the  delegation
              about the role played by MERCOSUR (a forum that oversees trade
              between Latin American countries and the rest of the world) in
              promoting trade agreements between Southern Africa and Brazil.
              The plans are being initiated by the private sector in  Brazil
              to get South Africa  more  engaged  in  bilateral  trade  with
              Brazil.


     VI.    Conclusion


         The circumstances under which the privatisation of the economy  and
         state enterprises in Argentina and Brazil were undertaken  differed
         from those in South Africa:


         *   The  democracies   of   both   countries   were   preceded   by
           dictatorships. Brazil inherited massive state debt (8% to 10% of
           GDP, vs 2% for South Africa)
         *  Government overspending was the order of the  day,  while  South
           Africa boasted strict fiscal discipline


         *  A backlog in the maintenance of public services had built up  to
           such  an  extent  that  transport,  telephone,  gas,  water  and
           electricity supply  systems  were  outdated  and  inadequate  to
           enable vigorous economic growth.


     VII.   Observations


         1. South Africa basically does not  need  to  privatise/restructure
              in order to pay off excessive state debts or  to  recapitalise
              the country's infrastructure; it can  restructure  to  enhance
              black economic empowerment, provide developmental capital  for
              future development and bring in  working  capital,  managerial
              skills, expertise and experience from the private sector.


         2. South Africa should never allow  the  wholesale  sale  of  state
              enterprises without at least retaining a  strategic  say  (the
              golden share) for the government - for the sake  of  sustained
              future development of the region and the continent.


         3. South Africa should stick to its  policy  of  fiscal  discipline
              and never allow institutions like the World  Bank  to  dictate
              its economic policy because of too much borrowing from foreign
              money sources.


         4. Privatisation of basic services,  like  water  and  electricity,
              resulted in high tariffs.


         5. Privatisation of  state  information  utilities,  like  military
              satellite systems, should be avoided at all costs to  preserve
              state security.


         6. After privatisation more people had access to  public  utilities
              and the quality of service improved, but privatisation in both
              countries resulted in job losses.

     D.     Highlights


         1. Meeting held at Molopo Local Municipality


              (a) Briefing by SANDF


                  The closure of the army base in  Pompfret  was  negotiated
                  with the provincial government. There is a study  document
                  in the Premier's Office on the way forward  regarding  the
                  situation in Pompfret. The SANDF as  a  client  department
                  of the national Department of Public Works must  have  the
                  inventory which must be handed over to  Public  Works.  It
                  was  reported  that  the  survey  of  the  Department   of
                  Environmental Affairs and Tourism indicated in  1991  that
                  Pompfret was declared unhealthy for habitation,  whereupon
                  the SANDF proposed that the community should be  moved  to
                  Zeerust, where alternative accommodation was organised.


                  We  were  informed  that  the  relocation  cost  was  R356
                  million, unlike the rehabilitation plan, which would  cost
                  R66 million every  five  years,  and  that  the  community
                  declined  the  proposal,  which  led   to   some   members
                  accepting severance packages from the SANDF.


                  It was  clarified  that  the  community  of  Pompfret  had
                  acquired South African citizenship, and thus the  aim  was
                  also to integrate them into  the  society.  The  issue  of
                  rental payments is unclear. It was  reported  that  on  21
                  and 22 June 2001, the SANDF  pulled  out  of  negotiations
                  with the provincial government.
              (b) Briefing by provincial Department of Public Works


                  The Department of Public Works has hired  security  people
                  from within the community. According  to  the  information
                  at the department's disposal, the SANDF has not  submitted
                  an inventory register. It  was  reported  that,  when  the
                  Army vacated the base,  they  removed  all  the  equipment
                  from the buildings,  including  curtains,  doors,  frames,
                  etc. The base was not officially handed over.


              (c) Briefing by the Molopo Local Municipality


                  The local municipality is operating  from  other  premises
                  on the army base.  Communities  felt  that  they  are  now
                  neglected, after being used by the previous government.  A
                  satellite police station has been set  up.  The  community
                  does not  believe  that  there  is  an  asbestos  problem.
                  Buildings have been abandoned and  vandalised.  The  thugs
                  are using the base to store stolen goods.  The  population
                  living in Pompfret is about 5  000  -  even  though  those
                  working  on  other  bases,  regard   Pompfret   as   their
                  hometown. Community members are worried because  there  is
                  an unopened building,  and  they  are  afraid  that  maybe
                  there are dangerous weapons inside. Clarity is  needed  on
                  this. The opinion of the local municipality  is  that  the
                  government does not want to take  responsibility  for  the
                  area.


         2. Meeting at the Greater Taung Municipality


              (a) Briefing by SANDF
                  The  Army  base  was  previously  a  mining  area,   which
                  subsequently was turned into a  military  village  by  the
                  Bophuthatswana government. Buxton was closed down  because
                  it was too small for the battalion to use. This  base  was
                  also handed over to  the  national  Department  of  Public
                  Works. The meeting was informed that on 15 June  2001,  an
                  agreement  was  reached  with  the  Department  of   Local
                  Government that it would take over the Buxton area.


              (b) Briefing by Department of Public Works


                  The provincial Department of Public Works agreed that  the
                  housing  unit  and  the  military  village  in  the   base
                  belonged to the national Department of Public  Works,  but
                  that the other part fell under the  Department  of  Social
                  Services, Arts, Culture and Sports. When the  SANDF  moved
                  out of the area, civilians occupied the village.  Criteria
                  of  moving  civilians  was  discussed  -  the   allocation
                  process was in  the  hands  of  the  Department  of  Local
                  Government and the local municipality.  The  area  has  no
                  security and some buildings are vandalised.


              (c) Briefing by Greater Taung Local Municipality


                  The municipality has been frustrated since 1996,  as  they
                  have tried to negotiate with the provincial Department  of
                  Public Works that the property (base) area be  transferred
                  to  them.  Nothing  in  writing  was  forwarded   to   the
                  municipality  in   regard   to   the   handing-over.   The
                  municipality continued  to  request  assistance  from  the
                  Department of Public Works,  who  offered  to  secure  the
                  area since assets were moved from the base. The issue  was
                  also reported to the police, as  they  indicated  that  it
                  was  difficult  to   investigate,   since   the   national
                  Department of Public Works has not opened a case.


         3. Meeting at Zeerust Local Municipality


              (a) Briefing by national Department of Public Works


                  There was no formal request by the North  West  provincial
                  government to occupy these bases.  Klippan  was  renovated
                  in 1996 to accommodate a farm school, but the process  has
                  not been completed. The Gopane army base  was  vandalised;
                  fortunately  the   provincial   government   engaged   the
                  community to obtain security.
     E.     Recommendations


         The Committee recommends as follows:


         1. The Premier's office and  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs
              should  forward  the  report  on  the  feasibility  study   on
              asbestosis and the rehabilitation of Pompfret.


         2. The SANDF should submit a report of all  the  army  bases  which
              were closed in the North West Province.


         3. The national  Department  of  Public  Works  should  compile  an
              inventory and assets register for the closed army bases in the
              province.


         4. The affected provincial portfolio committees should initiate  an
              interdepartmental structure which should include the  affected
              local municipality. The process should be finalised within six
              months.


         5. There should be a minimum supply of services to  Pompfret  while
              awaiting the report, which should be expedited.


         6. The provincial government should make available the  World  Bank
              research conducted regarding Pompfret  and  the  environmental
              report in respect thereof.


         7. Report should be submitted on the intentions of  the  provincial
              government regarding  all  the  army  bases  which  have  been
              closed.


         8. The Department of Local  Government  should  submit  a  progress
              report on the allocation of houses in the Military Village and
              the transfer of Buxton Army Base to the  Greater  Taung  Local
              Municipality.
         9. The provincial  government  should  look  at  sustainability  of
              Pompfret by putting up projects and other employment  creation
              activities.


         10.     The laws of the country  should  be  respected  and  should
              apply.


         11.     The local council should  make  written  proposals  to  the
              Department of Public Works and submit copies to the  Committee

         12.     The Committee should have a joint  meeting  with  directors
              responsible for property  management  in  the  Departments  of

     F.     Follow-up visit to CBPWP Projects


         1. Lonely Park School


              The Committee could not get inside the premises of the  school
              and see for itself what has been done to repair the cracks  in
              the foundation, because the gates were locked. It was reported
              that the foundation of the school was reinforced with tyres so
              that, should the floor expand, the  tyres  would  be  able  to
              absorb the expansion. The project was completed on time.


         2. Montshiwa Clinic


              The  clinic  has  been  completed  and  is   functional.   The
              contractor is renovating the old part of the clinic - this  is
              done with money from the amount that was  made  available  for
              the new structure of  the  clinic.  The  work  has  been  done
              satisfactorily. There were no additional  funds  sourced  from
              the government.


         3. Bophelong Hospital
              The conditions in the theatre at  this  hospital  are  getting
              worse. The roof is cracking, and the  authorities  are  afraid
              that it might collapse and  cause  injuries  to  patients  and
              workers. The airconditioning is not functioning properly,  and
              the   responsible   company   does   not   want   to    repair
              airconditioners not fitted by them. There are some areas  that
              were renovated since the Committee's last  visit.  Doors  have
              been replaced, but with  the  same  kind  of  material,  which
              probably will not last long.


     G.     Meeting with Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB)


         The board was established in 2001 and a  CEO  has  been  appointed.
         The Board is working closely with the Department of  Public  Works,
         as partners. The public is strongly represented on the  Board,  and
         the construction industry is fully behind  it.  The  Board  is  now
         ready  to  proceed  with  its  function  of  service  delivery.  At
         present,  the  CIDB  is  constructing  a   booklet   for   emerging
         contractors, for them to knowing their rights and obligations.
         State property holdings and asset management - State land  disposal
         and Asset register


         It was reported that after closure the Pompfret Army Base with  all
         its responsibilities was transferred to the province. Staff of  the
         Department  of  Public  Works  dealing  with  properties  have   no
         capacity to do their work. There are no officials who are  involved
         in the transfer of properties. This  is  a  function  of  political
         office-bearers. It is only the Minister of Land Affairs who  issues
         certificates on the disposal of land. An asset  register  has  been
         compiled and is available for MPs - information is obtainable  from
         the Committee Secretary.

         The IDT would like to enhance  its  delivery  capacity,  speed  and

     I.     Launch of Council for Built Environment (CBE)


         The Committee was invited to attend the launching of the CBE.  This
         Council was established by an Act of  Parliament  (Act  No.  43  of
         2000), along with six other Acts  regulating  the  re-establishment
         of the built environment professions. This Act  became  operational
         in  September  2001,  following  the  establishment  of  six  built
         environment councils.


         Council members were appointed on the strength of their  experience
         in their particular fields and their commitment to the  advancement
         of the built environment professions. They embody  the  skills  and
         experience that will add value to the CBE.


         The CBE is  established  as  an  overarching  body  for  the  built
         environment professions. Its core objectives include:


         1.  Ensuring  consistent   application   of   policy   within   the
              profession.


         2. Advising the  government  on  matters  impacting  on  the  built
              environment.
         3. Managing co-ordination between the councils to  support  matters
              of national interest.


         4. Enabling the recognition of new professions.


         5. Promoting the recognition of  different  categories  within  the
              professions.


         6. Acting as an appeal body for affected professions and  aggrieved
              members of public.


     J.     Conclusion


         The Committee would like to thank the following persons  for  their
         efforts in making the study tour successful:
