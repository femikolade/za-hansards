                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 12 September  2002  marks  the  25th  anniversary  of  the
       cowardly killing of Comrade Steve Bantu Biko;


  (2) believes that this patriot played an important role in  the  struggle
       for the liberation of South Africa; and


  (3) salutes this fallen hero of our country.

[Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and outrage the horrific injuries sustained by a six-
       year-old rape victim in Johannesburg;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  doctors had to perform surgery to repair injuries which left her
           colon hanging out and which ripped away  the  skin  between  her
           vagina and rectum; and


       (b)  this is by no means an isolated case;


  (3) expresses its revulsion at the continued rape of children, with about
       21 500 children raped in 2000 alone, with  only  8%  of  these  cases
       resulting  in  convictions,  and  that  statistics   for   2001   are
       incomplete; and


  (4) condemns the abject failure of  the  ANC  Government  to  fulfil  its
       promise to protect our children.

Mr M A MZIZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the infamous Sands Hotel in Hillbrow has been closed  down
       and vacated after a high court interdict was  granted  to  close  the
       hotel;


  (2) further notes that according to a police spokesperson, the hotel  was
       well known for drug dealers operating their illegal  businesses  from
       the premises;


  (3) congratulates all involved in the closure of this hotel; and


  (4) hopes that this serves as a warning to  similar  establishments  that
       they could face  the  same  action  if  they  do  not  rectify  their
       problems.

Ms H M MPAKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  the ANC Youth  League,  ANCYL,  launched  its  58th  anniversary
           celebrations on 10 September 2002;


       (b)  the Youth League has acted as  a  disciplined  body  of  opinion
           within the ANC, and has become a  political  and  organisational
           preparatory school for young revolutionaries to play  a  leading
           role within the ANC and in society; and


       (c)  the ANC Youth League as an organisation nurtured ANC  cadres  of
           highest stature such as O R Tambo, N Rolihlahla Mandela,  Walter
           Sisulu, Peter Mokaba, and many others;


  (2) believes that the  organisation  has  played  an  important  role  in
       transmitting revolutionary traditions of  the  older  generations  to
       younger activists and has influenced  ANC  politics  and  methods  of
       struggle to meet the new and changing political environment; and


  (3) joins the ANC Youth League in celebrating its  58th  anniversary  and
       makes a clarion call to all youth in our country  to  continue  along
       the path of the founder members.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mev  die  Speaker,  ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  gaan
voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met skok kennis neem van die bewerings dat die leier van die DA,  die
       agbare Tony Leon, klaarblyklik gereël het, of  ten  minste  toegelaat
       het,  dat  sy  persoonlike  beeldpoetser,  mnr   Ryan   Coetzee,   'n
       addisionele salaris van R33 000 per maand  uit  belastingbetalersgeld
       ontvang vir sogenaamde strategiese advies wat  hy  aan  die  destydse
       Premier en DA-leier van Wes-Kaapland, mnr Gerald Morkel, gegee het;


  (2) daarop aandring dat, indien die  bewerings  korrek  bevind  word  dat
       hierdie soort uitspattige vergoedingspakkette wel aan DA-``fat cats''
       uitgedeel is, daardie geld teruggevorder  word  en  eerder  aangewend
       word om armoede in die Wes-Kaap te verlig; en


  (3) met arendsoë waak teen dieselfde soort  verregaande  spandabelrigheid
       in stadsrade, soos Kaapstad, wat tans nog deur die DA beheer word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock the allegations that the leader of the DA,  Mr  Tony
       Leon, apparently arranged for, or at least allowed, his personal spin
       doctor, Mr Ryan Coetzee, to receive an additional salary of  R33  000
       per month from taxpayers money for so-called strategic  advice  which
       he had provided to the then Premier and  DA  leader  of  the  Western
       Cape, Mr Gerald Morkel;


  (2) insists upon it that, if it is found that these allegations are true,
       that this type of excessive remuneration packages were dealt  out  to
       DA fat cats, that money be recovered and instead be used to alleviate
       poverty in the Western Cape; and


  (3)  guards  with  an  eagle  eye  against  the  same  type  of   extreme
       extravagance at city councils,  such  as  Cape  Town,  which  are  at
       present still controlled by the DA.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  will  move  on
behalf of the UDM at the next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) confirms that clean and effective governance at provincial level must
       be ensured as an integrated part of democracy in South Africa;
  (2)  acknowledges  that,  in  this  regard,  the   role   of   provincial
       legislatures  is  important,   since   the   democratically   elected
       representatives of a province's people provide  oversight  and  input
       into the governance of the province;


  (3) notes with dismay that internal political wrangling within the ANC in
       the Free State has resulted in  the  disruption  of  that  province's
       legislature due to the refusal of the Speaker to be  removed  by  the
       newly elected ANC provincial executive;


  (4) expresses its concern  at  the  manner  in  which  this  incident  is
       damaging the credibility of that legislature and bringing  democratic
       governance into disrepute; and


  (5) urges the ANC to get its house in order.

[Applause.]

Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I  shall  move
on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that the SA Navy will transport 200 elephants and other
       animals being donated to replace wildlife killed during  the  27-year
       civil war;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  this will help in restoring national parks in  Angola  and  will
           promote tourism and job creation, and this initiative is in line
           with the spirit of the  discussions  in  the  World  Summit  for
           Sustainable Development; and


       (b)  this initiative will contribute positively in the reconstruction
           and development of  Angola,  whose  natural  heritage  has  been
           destroyed by decades of civil war; and
  (3) commends the governments of Botswana and South  Africa  for  donating
       wildlife to Angola.

[Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Speaker of  the  Free  State  Legislature  refused  to
       resign, although redeployed by the ANC to Parliament;


  (2) further notes that the session of  the  legislature  called  for  the
       swearing in of the new Speaker by the Judge President, was  adjourned
       early by the outgoing Speaker to prevent the installation of the  new
       Speaker;


  (3) requests the President, in his capacity as leader of the ANC, to  end
       the circus which is conducted by his party in the Free State, as  the
       ANC, instead of placing the interests of the voters  first,  indulges
       in internal warfare and has made the Free State the laughing stock of
       South Africa.

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  advances in the field of natural medicine made over recent years
           can radically reduce the incidence of common  diseases  such  as
           heart attacks, cancer, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure and
           many that affect developing countries;


       (b)  while  a  primary  cause  of  the  world's  most  common  health
           conditions is a chronic deficiency of  micronutrients  essential
           for optimum cellular  energy,  metabolism  as  well  as  optimum
           connective tissue stability, scientific knowledge  is  available
           and essential nutrients can be  produced  at  low  cost  in  any
           quantity anywhere in the world, this life-saving information  is
           being blocked due to little incentive to promote these promising
           avenues of medicine; and


       (c)  acknowledges that the pharmaceutical industry  is  dependent  on
           synthetic drugs that allow a high return on investment based  on
           patentability;


       (d)  however, this proven science of natural health  with  its  great
           potential for low-cost intervention, must be properly  explored,
           packaged and made available to the populace;


  (2) calls on -


       (a)  the Government to facilitate  availability  of  this  avenue  of
           medicine by urgently  commissioning  a  committee  in  order  to
           access and assess all existing scientific  research  on  natural
           medicine, with a view to implementing natural  health  solutions
           in South Africa; and


       (b)  pharmaceutical  companies  to  make  greater  effort  ...  [Time
           Expired.]

Ms B P SONJICA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the week of 01 to 07 September  2002  was  Deaf  Awareness
       Week under the theme ``Accessibility Within  an  Inclusive  Education
       System'';


  (2) believes that all learners, including disabled learners, have a right
       to equal access, equal opportunities  and  equal  rights  within  one
       educational system; and


  (3) calls on all stakeholders in our  society,  namely,  the  Government,
       business and all the people, to work towards the realisation  of  the
       rights of people with hearing impairment and for the  development  of
       the South African sign language.

[Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the series of break-ins targeting DA computers with the purpose
       of stealing the party's information and intellectual property;


  (2) further notes  that  17  such  incidents  have  been  reported  since
       December 2001, affecting DA offices in six of the nine provinces;


  (3)  believes  that  the  democratic  process  is  being   systematically
       undermined by this calculated targeting of the opposition; and
  (4) calls on the relevant agencies of justice to exhibit their commitment
       to preserving democracy in our country by ensuring that the  criminal
       perpetrators are brought to justice.

[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf
of the IFP at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the development of a new electoral law that  will  usher  in
       accountability as  a  core  value  of  our  parliamentary  system  in
       servicing the electorate;


  (2) desires that the research team, under the chairmanship of Dr Van  Zyl
       Slabbert, receives the support of the country  in  its  endeavour  to
       accomplish its task within a set mandate;


  (3) further welcomes the consideration  that  excellent  as  the  current
       system of election is, it still requires the question of  inclusivity
       to be revisited without obviating the high  level  of  simplicity  it
       offers to the voters; and


  (4) calls on all stakeholders and role-players to unite  in  choosing  an
       electoral  system  that  will  be  best  for  the  literate  and  the
       illiterate to serve their interests for many more years to come.

Mrs B TINTO: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of  Labour,  the  hon  Membathisi  Mdladlana,
       visited Liwa Primary School  in  Nyanga  on  World  Literacy  Day  on
       Monday, 09 September 2002;


  (2) believes that -
       (a)  the visit by the Minister contributes in  the  developing  of  a
           culture of reading and  learning  amongst  school  children  and
           youth;


       (b)  a thoroughgoing programme of  transformation  requires,  amongst
           other things, patriots and youth  in  particular,  who  must  be
           seized with the task of engaging in scientific enquiry  to  meet
           the challenges of transformation; and


       (c)  that this task will be fulfilled only if we encourage a  culture
           of reading, and a quest for scientific knowledge;


  (3) commends the hon  Membathisi  Mdladlana  for  visiting  Liwa  Primary
       School on World Literacy Day; and


  (4) calls on all leaders in communities to encourage school children  and
       youth to develop a culture  of  reading  and  learning  in  order  to
       prepare themselves to play a leading role in building our country.

[Applause.]

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Mev die Speaker, ek gee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die  volgende
sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Nuwe NP besorg is oor die snerpende koue, sneeu en reën wat  weer
       eens grootskaalse verliese in die Oos-Kaap teweeg bring en dít terwyl
       opruimingswerk na die swaar reën en oorstromings in Augustus nog  aan
       die gang is;


  (2) dit gelei het tot lewensverlies;


  (3) talle Oos-Kapenaars se kragtoevoer afgesny is;


  (4) boere groot verliese ly;


  (5) paaie in sommige gebiede onbegaanbaar is; en
  (6) die Nuwe NP simpatiseer met die familie van rampslagoffers,  sy  dank
       uitspreek teenoor noodreddingswerkers wat uit hul pad gaan om bystand
       te verleen aan slagoffers en 'n versoek aan die Regering rig om  alle
       moontlike vorme van hulp te verleen.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr W J LE ROUX: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the New NP is concerned at the biting cold, snow and rains which have
       once again brought about large-scale losses in the Eastern Cape, even
       while mopping-up operations after  the  heavy  rains  and  floods  in
       August are still in progress;


  (2) this has led to loss of life;


  (3) the electricity supply to many people in the Eastern  Cape  has  been
       cut off;


  (4) farmers are suffering heavy losses;


  (5) the roads in some areas are impassable; and

       out of their way in rendering assistance to victims  and  appeals  to
       the Government to provide all possible forms of relief.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the despicable terror attacks which took place in the USA a year
           ago today and we remember all its victims; and


       (b)  the response of many nations to the war on terror has led to  an
           unprecedented increase in security and legislative  measures  to
           combat terrorism;


  (2) views with seriousness the warning by Mary Robinson, the outgoing  UN
       human  rights  chief,  that  antiterror  legislation  and   prolonged
       detention of suspects without legal assistance are  amongst  measures
       which fall foul of basic rights;


  (3) reiterates her view that human rights standards must again return  to
       the forefront of concern; and


  (4) calls upon all nations to be vigilant and to zealously protect  basic
       human rights as the cornerstones of democracy and freedom, and not to
       sacrifice them in the name of the war on terror.

[Applause.]

     THE CHALLENGE OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF DOMESTIC WORKERS,
             FARMWORKERS AND OTHER VULNERABLE GROUPS OF WORKERS

                          (Subject for discussion)
Mr K A MOLOTO: Madam Speaker and hon members, South Africans have  committed
themselves to building a humane, caring  and  prosperous  nation.  It  is  a
commitment that arises from the  acknowledgement  that  apartheid  laws  are
incompatible with democracy  and  the  need  for  labour  laws  that  ensure
equitable distribution of the national wealth.

Indeed, most South Africans are shy when they realise that the  majority  of
fellow South  Africans  experience  abject  poverty  due  to  the  malicious
intentions of apartheid laws that encouraged greed and superexploitation  of
black people. The Stallard Commission of 1922 stated that:


  Africans living in urban areas must minister to the needs  of  the  white
  man and should depart therefrom when they have ceased so to minister.

It is these conditions of existence and labour relations that  the  majority
of South Africans reject with utter contempt. It  is  these  types  of  laws
that treated them as subhumans and condemned them to poverty.  All  national
efforts at that time were marshalled  to  solve  the  problem  of  the  poor
white.

No South African can be proud of the fact that the wealth  in  some  of  the
richest families in South Africa is a product of cheap labour. They will  be
equally ashamed to realise that the real producers of  that  wealth  are  in
abject poverty. It also needs to be pointed out that apartheid  laws  had  a
severe impact on the quality of life of domestic workers and farmworkers.

The labour relations in the commercial farming sector have  been  marked  by
superexploitation of farmworkers, and violence in  certain  instances.  Even
during periods of massive surge or  boom  in  the  exports  of  agricultural
products,  benefits  hardly  trickled  down  to  these  vulnerable  workers.
Payment through the barbarous tot system had far  reaching  consequences  on
the moral  fabric  of  our  society  and  led  to  deterioration  in  health
conditions. The effects of it are still being  felt  even  today.  It  is  a
national shame.

The domestic workers have been subjected to  a  servant-master  relationship
where there  is  no  respect  for  domestic  workers.  They  are  called  in
derogatory terms, similar to those used during slavery,  that  is,  nannies,
servants, maids, and girls. My proud culture  requires  me  to  show  utmost
respect to elderly people. It makes one  withdraw  with  shame  to  hear  an
elderly lady being called a girl. It defies  everything  I  learnt  from  my
late mother. Domestic workers render a valuable service to  South  Africans.
Our productivity is enhanced by the service they provide.

Ka Sepedi ba re letsogo le lengwe le hlatswa ke le lengwe. Go na  le  polelo
e nngwe gape  e  re  mahlong  a  motho  ga  go  swane  le  mahlong  a  mpša.
(Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[In Sepedi we say, one hand washes  the  other.  A  human  being  cannot  be
equated to a dog.]

Literally it means that one hand washes another. A  human  being  cannot  be
equated to a dog.

It is quite disturbing to realise that there are  certain  sections  of  our
population who have the notion that there should be  no  state  interference
in the relations of  workers,  farmers,  and  their  employers.  Surely,  we
cannot allow the servant-master labour relations to coexist with  democracy.
Such relationships pose a serious threat to the survival  of  our  democracy
and constitute a violation of human rights.

There  can  never  be  a  peaceful   coexistence   between   democracy   and
superexploitation of domestic workers,  farmworkers,  and  other  vulnerable
groups of workers. It is quite encouraging that there are employers who  are
even prepared to ensure that domestic workers receive  training  and  better
benefits. It brings great joy to realise that there are employers  who  even
allow domestic workers to engage in trade union activity. They  stand  as  a
shining example to all of us.

There are commercial farmers who deserve a lot of praise.  There  are  those
who ensure that farmworkers receive housing and educational  facilities  for
their children. There are even  wine  farmers  who  have  allocated  certain
portions  of  their  land  to  their  workers  to  engage  in   co-operative
activities. Such cases,  few  as  they  might  be,  bear  testimony  to  the
willingness of South Africans to defend our democracy and  the  right  to  a
better life for fellow South Africans.

The ANC, the glorious liberation movement of our  people,  leads  the  fight
for the better life  for  all  South  Africans.  Our  people  support  their
glorious liberation movement in the realisation  of  this  goal.  All  South
Africans deserve a better life. Blood was shed for the  realisation  of  the
fruit of freedom. The ANC fought fearlessly for  equality  before  the  law.
Our people have given us the mandate to change their lives for  the  better.
We will defend their right to dignity with every fibre of our being.

[The glorious  movement  of  our  people,  the  ANC,  says  farmworkers  and
domestic workers need to lead better lives. Lives  which  were  lost  during
the struggle for our freedom were not lost in vain. The ANC is the  champion
of the poor,  the  workers  and  those  who  love  the  advancement  of  the
Africans. There is no way in which the glorious movement can turn  its  back
on people's needs. It will fight for them without  fail.  The  era  of  ill-
treating people like slaves is over. We are thankful for the  support  South
Africans give to their glorious movement, the ANC.]

Let us celebrate the gains  that  these  vulnerable  workers  have  realised
under the new democracy. Let us guard these gains jealously. They assist  in
defining us as human beings.

Alle werkers wat huishulpe en plaaswerkers in  diens  het,  behoort  hierdie
verandering te verwelkom. Suid-Afrika kan nie sonder die belangrike  dienste
wat  deur  dié  werknemers  verrig  word,  klaarkom  nie.  Plaaswerkers   is
belangrik vir die versekering van voedselsekuriteit in  die  land.  Die  rol
van huiswerkers onder moeilike omstandighede en teen lae  lone  moet  vandag
sterk waardeer word. Die ANC sal altyd aan hulle  kant  wees,  want  dit  is
hulle wat die leiers van môre grootmaak. Dit is  'n  jammerte  dat  van  die
mense wat deur hulle grootgemaak is, vandag teen die idee is dat  hulle  ook
'n beter lewe moet kry. 'n Beter lewe vir almal is ook  vir  huiswerkers  en
plaaswerkers. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[All workers who have domestic  workers  and  farmworkers  in  their  employ
ought to welcome this change. South Africa cannot do without  the  important
services which are rendered by these employees.  Farmworkers  are  important
in order to ensure food security  in  the  country.  The  role  of  domestic
workers, under difficult circumstances and for  low  wages,  must  today  be
highly valued. The ANC will always be on their side, because it is they  who
bring up the leaders of tomorrow. It is a pity that some of the  people  who
were brought up by them are today opposed to the idea that they should  also
have a better life. A better life for everyone is also for domestic  workers
and farmworkers. [Applause.]]

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Madam Speaker, domestic and farmworkers are a  vital
part of South Africa's economy. We believe  that  the  challenge,  regarding
both, is to  strike  a  balance  between  decent  employment  standards  and
flexibility in order to meet the needs of employers and  at  the  same  time
maintaining or increasing the level of employment in these sectors.

Let me state clearly, from the outset, that the DA rejects slave  wages.  It
urges employers to pay a decent wage for decent work, but domestic  workers'
jobs are now at risk because of ministerial meddling  and  the  introduction
of a minimum wage.

According to the Department of Labour's own research, presented in a  report
in 2001, the implementation of a minimum  wage  for  domestic  servants  may
lead to potential job losses  of  169  000.  Those  results  came  from  the
Minister's research - 169 000 more vulnerable South  Africans  without  jobs
and more than 100 000  breadwinners  without  the  means  to  support  their
families. Those findings came from the Minister's research.

South Africa needs jobs. A minimum wage is certainly not the  answer.  There
are better options. There are other options.  Not  only  will  they  prevent
this sort of loss, but they will  create  more  jobs.  For  example,  up  to
certain levels ... [Interjections.] The  member  must  listen  and  he  will
learn. Under certain conditions, they should  make  the  wages  of  domestic
workers tax-deductible. This will encourage and motivate  people  to  employ
domestic workers and enhance employment.

However, the DA  does  support  the  recommendations  of  increasing  family
responsibility leave, the reduction  of  notice  periods,  a  code  of  good
practice for guidelines of service termination, and a maximum  deduction  of
wages for accommodation that meets a certain standard. The  introduction  of
a minimum wage by the Minister has failed  not  only  those  who  will  lose
their jobs, but also the millions of unemployed people in South Africa.

First amongst the reasons for having the minimum wage  is  to  assist  those
vulnerable  workers  whom  we  are  discussing  here  today.  Though  it  is
appealing to suggest  that  everyone  should  earn  a  certain  wage  it  is
difficult to imagine that it is that easy. If it is, then  why  do  so  many
countries have workers who earn so little? Have those countries just  missed
the boat on appropriate legislation? If  it  is  possible  to  mandate  high
wages, why is it not possible to  mandate  low  prices  for  food,  housing,
clothing, and everything else that makes life livable?

The minimum wage laws focus on wages and not on employment.  If  someone  is
employed, then she will receive at least the guaranteed wage. The  law  sets
the terms  of  whatever  employment  happens  to  occur.  The  reduction  in
employment that results from the imposition  of  a  minimum  wage  which  is
concentrated amongst these vulnerable  workers  with  fewer  skills  is  the
cruel and,  one  had  would  hope,  an  unintended  consequence  of  such  a
determination that our hon Minister has made.

The implication of this theory is simple and direct. The prediction that  an
artificial increase in the price of  something  causes  less  of  it  to  be
purchased is the most fundamental prediction of economics. It is called  the
law of demand and, frankly, it cannot be repealed by this House  or  by  any
Minister. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Madam Speaker, Ministers and colleagues, domestic  workers
as well as farmworkers have been  and  are  still  the  most  neglected  and
deprived group of workers in our society today.

That means that South Africa has a lesson to  learn.  This  lesson  is  that
where  justice  is  denied,  where  poverty  is  enforced,  where  ignorance
prevails, and where any one class  is  made  to  feel  that  society  is  an
organised conspiracy to oppress other people, to rob and degrade them,  then
neither persons nor property will be safe in future.  Let  this  be  a  leaf
from which we can learn. Let us learn from what is happening in Zimbabwe.

The domestic workers and farmworkers have gone  through  these  deprivations
for too long, as far as I am concerned. These  are  the  workers  who,  from
time immemorial, have been referred to as ``boys, girls, or  nannies''.  All
sorts of names have been thrown at these people. These are the  workers  who
even work for 12 hours in a day.

The job description of these workers makes a sad reading and  if  I  had  to
present a job description of a domestic worker, it  will  go  like  this:  I
clean your premises; I cook for you; I take care of your  children;  I  take
care of your aged mother and father; I act as security;  I  nurse  both  the
humans and animals that you have; I plough your crops;  I  harvest;  I  wash
your clothes; I iron your clothes; and I do everything that you could  never
do yourself; yet I do it with a slave wage that you give me.

When Jan van Riebeeck landed here in 1652, with his sailors,  soldiers,  and
those who accompanied him with their guns, the first action that  they  took
was to capture the indigenous residents of the country,  that  is,  Khoisans
and Hottentots, men and women, and they made them slaves. It is now  history
that nine months after they had  captured  those  women,  coloured  children
were born. [Laughter.]

The sad part of this is that these children did not inherit  their  fathers'
names. They did not know  who  their  fathers  were,  but  they  were  given
fictitious names. Their surnames were January, February, March, April,  May,
June, you name it. [Laughter.] [Applause.] These were their names.

It has been reported that over 800 000 domestic workers are  here  today.  I
hear October complaining  over  there.  That  boy  is  a  son  of  a  slave.
[Laughter.] It is due to these workers that MPs in  Parliament  are  sitting
here today. If it were not for them, members would  not  been  sitting  here
themselves. [Applause.] It is their sacrifice that has put members here.

We acknowledge with thanks,  too,  that  the  Government  has  extended  the
Unemployment Insurance Act to these  domestic  workers.  We  hope  that  the
Minister will see to it that  this  is  implemented  as  soon  as  the  time
arrives.  Having  said  that,  I  must  express   my   grave   concern   and
disappointment with the unrealistic proposed minimum wage  as  announced  by
the Minister. Whilst others are complaining, I appeal to  the  Minister  not
to give our workers peanuts. They have had peanuts for too long.

The Minister's proposal of a minimum wage does not recognise this sector  of
workers. It does not recognise the contributions which  they  have  made  to
this  country.  If  there  is  any  sector  of  workers  who  have  made   a
contribution  to  this  country,  it  is  the  domestic  workers   and   the
farmworkers, more than any other sector. I further want to appeal ...  [Time
expired.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Madam Speaker, could you allow a person with a slave  name
to address the House! [Interjections.] It is precisely for that very  reason
of the utterances that we heard, yet again, of the  DA  rejecting  the  tool
that the ANC-led Government has put in  place  for  workers,  that  we  were
correct in putting forward a minimum  wage  for  farmworkers,  domestic  and
many other vulnerable workers.

When election time comes in this country, it is the very  DA  that  goes  to
the farmworkers and domestic workers and tell them to vote  for  them.  But,
what they do not tell the farmworkers and domestic workers, who are  sitting
in the public gallery today, is that it is the DA  that  is  forever  voting
against workers' rights and labour relations in this  House.  [Applause.]  I
am very happy that the workers, who are in the  public  gallery,  have  seen
and heard for themselves how they always oppose anything  that  we  want  to
put forward, as the ANC, to improve the lives of workers  in  this  country.
[Applause.]

In discussing this topic, we need to look at who are the vulnerable  sectors
in our society. The category of vulnerable sectors in our  society  goes  as
far as the  construction  industry,  farming,  and  even  parts  of  retail,
catering  and  domestic  sectors.  All  of  them  can  be  characterised  as
vulnerable sectors in which the labour process, working conditions  and  the
production  cycle  combine  to   make   it   difficult   to   build   stable
organisations. The domestic workers can attest to that.

In  the  construction  industry,  the  large  majority  of   unskilled   and
semiskilled workers are often  on  fixed-term  contracts.  The  construction
sites are not permanent workplaces. Again, it is a cyclical  industry  where
many workers are unemployed for long  periods  of  time.  There  is  growing
emphasis on small contractors  as  part  of  the  so-called  black  economic
empowerment.

In agriculture, farms employ  small  numbers  of  workers.  Large  distances
separate each workplace from the next. Access to farms is difficult and  the
work is, of course, seasonal. One would find that large numbers  of  workers
on the farms are either illegal immigrants or, in many instances,  children.
Many of them are women. All of them are brought  into  these  places  simply
because of cheap labour.

Farmworkers also face specific working conditions. Their housing is tied  to
their jobs and  bound  into  paternalistic  and  individualistic  ownership.
Large  segments  of  the  retail  and  catering  sectors  are  comprised  of
vulnerable  workers  as  one  would  find  them  in  small   shops,   cafés,
guesthouses and so on. Today, part of the retail sector is going  into  what
is called franchises and subcontracting. Large numbers of those workers  who
work there are casual labour.

Domestic workers, by far, remain very isolated in their workplaces and  work
long hours. There are dismissals all the  time.  Contracting,  cleaning  and
security services have, at last, started to enter into the domain  of  being
regulated.

What is significant out of all these groups is that the majority  are  women
- vulnerable women in all of those sectors. The political  choice  that  the
ANC made, regarding the RDP and the 1999 manifesto, to transform the  labour
market and give special attention to the vulnerable sectors was correct.  It
was correct because we promised democracy and citizens' rights. We  promised
the rights to work in  fair  and  decent  conditions,  and  the  rights  for
citizens to get into the economy and working life. We also promised  an  end
to apartheid division and, of course, the legacy of the colonial past.

It is no coincidence that we have these sectors with their  conditions.  Our
colonial history, as has already been ably articulated by hon Middleton,  is
a history of slave labour with social conditions that we inherited. We  have
had conditions in slavery where, for  example,  slaves  were  told  that  no
slaves were permitted  into  the  inner  sanctum  of  the  cemetery  at  the
funerals of white slave owners. Slaves, again, were not allowed to  purchase
any alcohol for their  slave  masters.  Slaves  were  not  allowed  to  wear
leather shoes and stockings. Of course, on a Sunday, slaves  were  bound  to
their places and they could not have any movement around. That is  what  the
hon members of the DA still want us to have. [Interjections.]

Most of the slaves even had their original names taken  from  them,  as  has
already been said. It was so utterly disgusting that they gave  us  calendar
names. I am proud to say that I am a September who comes out  of  the  slave
history. They were so disgusting that they gave some  people  emperor  names
such as Cupido and those that fathered  a  child,  Adonis.  They  even  gave
people tongue-in-cheek names like Dirkbeen. That is how disgusting  it  was,
and that is where the DA wants us to go back to. [Interjections.]

As I speak here today, my aunt who stays on an apple  farm  in  Grabouw,  at
the age of  70,  is  threatened  with  being  evicted  from  the  farm.  Her
children, who are my cousins, have already been  retrenched.  We  have  been
engaged in a battle over two years to  get  my  elderly  family  members  to
remain on this apple farm in Grabouw. It is  real  that  farm  and  domestic
workers continue to have these problems.

Our challenge towards sustainability in this area would be  that  the  floor
of rights that we have ushered in through the minimum wage provision  should
ensure that we end poverty; bring an end to the days where domestic  workers
would go home with old clothes and a few rands in their pockets,  and  where
farmworkers would go home with a bottle of wine and a permanent  and  casual
contract. We need to advance education and training strategies  through  the
skills levy so as to link them to an active job retention and  job  creation
strategy and, of course, an end to illiteracy in this area.

These  sectors  have  vindicated  the  argument  that  the   labour   market
flexibility, through low wages and slave conditions, is  not  an  answer  to
employment  growth.  The  success  of  minimum  wages  in   empowering   the
vulnerable workers and  lifting  them  out  of  poverty  lies  in  effective
implementation. The campaign should be publicised in a much bigger way  than
it has been. We should enhance it  in  order  to  improve  its  enforcement,
monitoring and further education.

The challenge to implementation is when workers know  that  they  are  being
exploited but are afraid to speak out  because  of  fear  of  dismissal  and
reprisals. The minimum wage, on its own, will not solve all the problems  of
poverty of these workers and other areas. We need to look at issues such  as
land  rights  and  tenancy  because  they  are  linked  to  the   employment
conditions.

So, I want to congratulate the Minister for  implementing  the  correct  and
progressive legislation which he has put through because it  will  start  to
take workers out of poverty. I would like to say to the  hon  Minister  that
the ANC supports the direction  that  he  has  taken,  regarding  vulnerable
workers. We will continue to reject the slave  mentality  that  we  have  on
that side of the House. [Applause.]
Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, domestic workers are in  isolated,  individualised
employment relationships, and they are subjected  to  highly  unequal  power
relations. As such, they are amongst the workers most in need of  assistance
to protect their rights. The market for domestic labour has always been  the
very model  of  a  negative  flexible  labour  market:  wage  rates  at  the
discretion of individual  employers,  limited  worker  organisations,  great
flexibility - both upwards and downwards in the  number  of  day  and  hours
worked - task flexibility,  and  no  barriers  to  discretionary  firing  of
workers.

Of the estimated 700 000 domestic workers, 88% are estimated to  be  African
and 96% women. It has been estimated that 35% of African women  and  23%  of
coloured women are employed as  domestic  workers.  Transformation  of  this
sector is thus directed at the poorest and the  most  oppressed  segment  of
the labour market. It is important to note that these  abysmally  low  wages
are sometimes not due to a lack of productivity  on  the  part  of  domestic
workers, but are rather a function of their low economic power.
There is essentially a buyer's market for  domestic  labour.  Employers  are
able to determine who they employ,  for  how  long  and  at  what  wage  and
conditions, and at what point the domestic worker should be dismissed,  with
the  domestic  employee  having  negligible  bargaining   power.   Education
attainment is particularly low  amongst  domestic  workers.  Almost  10%  of
domestic workers have no education.  Just  over  12%  have  passed  standard
five. Slightly less than 70% have passed standard six or less. This  problem
is compounded by the difficulty in getting access to education and  training
opportunities as many domestic workers live on the employers'  premises  and
have limited time off.

The establishment of a cleaning  Seta  and  the  provision  of  adult  basic
education and training for domestics should also be crucial  aspects  of  an
education and  skills  development  strategy  for  domestic  workers.  Local
authorities could form a structure through which adult  basic  education  as
well as a cleaning Seta could be run. Domestic workers  tend  to  work  long
and irregular hours and are often required to be on stand-by.  Approximately
18% of full-time domestic workers work more than a 45-hour week.  Almost  9%
of full-time domestic workers work 56 or more hours per  week.  Furthermore,
employers often do not pay for any overtime.

Domestic workers are subjected  to  many  forms  of  abuse  and  humiliation
including isolated living conditions and sexual harassment. Job security  is
particularly low. The dismissal of domestic workers - and 70%  and  in  most
cases they do not even receive severance pay-make up some 70% to 80% of  the
complaints that come to the Department of  Labour,  and  a  similar  if  not
higher proportion of cases that come to advice offices.

Standards  currently  applicable  to  domestic  workers  are  generally  not
adhered to. This situation needs to be improved  through  a  combination  of
making domestic workers more aware of their rights and  an  improved  system
of  Government  inspections  and  enforcement.  More  resources   from   the
department of labour should be allocated to this problem.

We recommend a collaborative programme between the Department of Labour  and
local governments to carry out education and  publicity  on  the  rights  of
domestic  workers.  Furthermore,  the  department  should  conduct  a  study
focusing on the harmonisation between different institutions which  will  be
involved in the regulation and financial management of the domestic  sector.
One of the main arguments against minimum wages is that they  are  projected
to lead to job losses. There may well be employers of domestic  workers  who
would genuinely be unable to afford a full time domestic, were they  to  pay
living wages. This does not mean that minimum  wages  should  lead  to  such
workers losing their jobs. The adjustments should rather be in terms of  the
number of hours worked. This would free up more time  for  domestic  workers
to take other part time jobs, or to pursue other activities.

Similarly, there  are  many  poor  or  middle-income  families  who  require
domestic assistance with childcare or other tasks, but  who  are  unable  to
afford an adequately remunerated domestic worker. The solution here  is  not
to allow domestic wages to fall  so  low  that  anyone  who  needs  domestic
assistance can  afford  it.  The  solution  lies  rather  in  more  publicly
provided facilities and a social wage with respect to  childcare  and  other
necessary services.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I rise to salute all  our  domestic  workers
and farmworkers throughout South Africa. They assist in contributing to  the
economy of our country. We acknowledge the presence  of  domestic  servants,
the majority of whom, I am told, come from our own  parliamentary  villages.
I believe it is important that this type of  debate  takes  place  in  their
presence because we, as members  of  Parliament,  must  set  an  example  in
paying a living wage to our domestic workers.

It is common knowledge that the Government's five-year programme  which  was
put in place between 1994 and 1999 was aimed at fundamentally reforming  the
apartheid labour market, and thereby improving on the  quality  of  life  of
domestic, farm and other  vulnerable  workers.  In  order  to  achieve  this
objective, the Government  introduced  a  legislative  framework  comprising
three pieces of legislation, namely, the Labour Relations Act of  1995,  the
Skills Development Act of 1998 and the Employment Equity Act of 1999.

This topic for  debate  in  this  House  today  invites  us  to  conduct  an
introspection  into  the  core  concerns  which  the  five-year   Government
programme sought to address which are, inter alia: the superexploitation  of
vulnerable workers; the phenomenon of the working poor;  extreme  inequality
and discrimination against these categories  of  workers  along  racial  and
gender lines; the fragmentation of the apartheid labour market in  terms  of
basic  rights,  protection  and  collective  bargaining;   human   resources
development; and the wage and occupational structures  and  practices  which
sought to bypass labour legislation on areas such as unfair  dismissals  and
retrenchments. In view of the hon the Minister's  recent  imbizo  visits  to
the provinces like Limpopo, I would like to know if the Government has  made
any improvements in addressing the core  concerns.  If  not,  what  are  the
major obstacles?

Maphelo a basomi ba dipolaseng le ba ka  magaeng  a  hlobaetsa.  Meputso  ya
bona e ya nyamisa. [The lives of farmworkers  and  domestic  workers  are  a
cause for concern. Their salaries are disgusting.]

Inflation for the rich means  less  savings  in  the  bank,  while  for  the
farmworkers, domestic and other vulnerable workers, it means less  food,  no
food or zero savings in the bank or no bank account at  all.  It  remains  a
challenge for the hon the Minister and us, as hon members of this House,  to
note that these categories of workers are still victims of humiliation, ill-
treatment and  abuse  by  thousands  of  employers  in  this  country.  Many
farmworkers, in particular, are still living under  horrible  and  abhorrent
conditions. [Time Expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson, it is the role of Government to  make  laws.
Sometimes, good laws  are  made  that  reverse  the  intended  good  of  the
legislation. The domestic workers sectoral determination regulation is  such
a case of good intention precipitating unintended consequences.

South Africa has a healthy domestic worker population that makes  up  almost
8% of the working population. It also has a farmworker  population  of  more
than 1,2 million. These are people who  presumably  operate  at  the  lowest
rung of the employment skill scale and yet play a pivotal role in the  chain
of productivity. In this regard, it is the right of all employees to  expect
compensation that is fair  and  of  an  acceptable  standard.  Recent  media
reports, however, show that  members  of  this  honourable  House  dishonour
their domestic worker by paying them less than  R400  per  month.  Shame  on
those hon members.

This is public knowledge, yet the  public  at  large,  who  employ  domestic
workers, do not fare much better. We, as  parliamentarians,  are  given  the
improbable task to  ensure  fair  play  in  a  sector  that  operates  under
different rules to normal employment requirements. For instance,  households
employ workers not on the  basis  of  generating  turnover  or  to  increase
profit margins. Domestic employment is  based  on  family  support,  service
flexibility and largely  relates  to  trust,  altruism  and  goodwill.  Such
employment relations are not conditional but nurtured  over  time.  However,
it is feared that making these employment relations conditional may lead  to
distrust  and  rigid  employment  conditions  which  would  be  imposed   by
employers and employee alike.

The ACDP supports the rights of domestic workers and  farmworkers  to  enjoy
basic employment security and human dignity. However, we must not  legislate
in such a way that we make it difficult to apply such rights. We should  not
regulate price controls and, at the same time, reduce the  marketability  of
these sectors. Instead of penalising those entrepreneurs,  who  are  willing
to engage others in productive employment, we should rather reward them.

Mr D S  MAIMANE:  Chairperson,  hon  members  of  Parliament,  the  hon  the
Minister of Labour, South Africa under apartheid rule was  a  country  where
human rights violation, exploitation and abuse of power were  the  order  of
the day. Domestic workers and farmworkers were the  major  victims  of  such
practices and continue to suffer, even when freedom  has  been  achieved  in
the country of their birth.  Their  exploitation  expresses  itself  in  the
following  manner:  low   wages,   unfavourable   working   conditions   and
vulnerability to expulsion from work without any valid reasons.

The ANC-led Government, as a champion of workers' rights, has  ensured  that
the plight of domestic workers and farmworkers  is  given  priority  by  the
Minister of Labour, Comrade Membathis Mdladlana.  We  need  to  congratulate
the hon the  Minister  for  confronting  this  anomaly  when  he  introduced
relevant legislative means to address the plight  of  both  farmworkers  and
domestic workers. It has to be borne in mind that in determining wages,  the
Minister is merely setting a standard as to the  manner  in  which  salaries
need to be paid. It does not mean that he will pay the workers himself.

Such a step goes in line with the President's call for the establishment  of
a caring society in our country - a society where human  beings  treat  each
other with respect. The master-servant relationship which has been a  common
practice under apartheid rule, must disappear with immediate effect.  I  had
an opportunity during the local government election, in 1995, to  witness  a
situation where farmers where denying farmworkers an opportunity to  express
their political will freely. Some years after that, I was surprised  by  the
manner in which  farmworkers  were  even  deprived  of  the  opportunity  to
continue to exercise that political expression.

In 1999, when I visited the same farms, the  situation  had  improved.  This
improvement can only be attributed to the message of hope to the  people  of
our country from the ANC-led Government. Both farmers  and  farmworkers,  at
least, have begun to recognise that they  need  each  other.  An  area  that
requires special attention is around salaries  and  working  conditions  for
the farmworkers. Most of them work without proper protective  clothing  and,
as a result, they die  of  diseases  and  injuries.  Access  to  health  and
educational facilities for both  farmworkers  and  their  children  is  also
another area that needs attention.

Although there are farmers who are trying their  best  to  attend  to  these
problems, some are just obstinate. We need to do something about this, as  a
democratic nation. The love for money has encouraged some farmers to  employ
our fellow Africans from Mozambique and Zimbabwe in  order  to  escape  from
paying a living a wage to South Africans. Such capitalist  tendencies  which
also smack of racist attitudes, need to be engaged so as to  bring  them  to
an abrupt terminal point.

We know that farmworkers' children are also used as labourers.  This  is  an
anomaly, again, and must not be tolerated. Perhaps, it must be  stated  that
the continued suppression and exploitation of farmworkers  has  far-reaching
socioeconomic consequences. In order to  avoid  such  developments,  farmers
must take heed of the call that our President made for a caring society.  If
farmers can respect and provide proper and reasonable shelter  and  salaries
for their farmworkers, South Africa's farms shall become more productive.

In this manner, children of farmworkers will be sent to school  and  not  be
used as labourers to pay for their stay on the farm.  The  attainment  of  a
caring society must manifest in the farms where food  for  our  country  and
the world is being produced. We cannot afford to  sell  food  to  the  world
with pride while those who produce it are exploited  and  denied  access  to
basic services. As a nation, we must provide educational  opportunities  and
accelerate the pace of change in those farming communities.

[A Motswana says that people must make preparations in good time. We  should
amend these things at the earliest stage. Farmworkers and  domestic  workers
should be given the rights and status that they deserve.  The  dignity  that
they were born with should be returned to them.

As a son of Maimane, I swear that changes will be seen, whether people  like
it or not.

I would like to thank and honour the Minister of  Labour  and  say  that  he
should hold on tightly. A Motswana says  that  success  comes  through  hard
work. He also says that one should persevere even in difficult times.]

I would like to  appeal  to  members  of  Parliament  and  all  other  South
Africans to abide by the rules  as  prescribed  by  law  and  to  remunerate
domestic workers accordingly. I would also like to appeal to all  democratic
forces to unite in action to change the lives of these important workers  of
our country by organising and educating them about their rights.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, die VF is  ten  gunste  daarvan  dat
die lewenskwaliteit van plaaswerkers  en  huiswerkers  verbeter  en  verhoog
moet word. Ek wil dit vandag baie duidelik stel dat politici moet  ophou  om
enkele gevalle waar daar verkeerde dinge plaasvind wat plaaswerkers  betref,
te verhef tot die veralgemening.

Ek het ook op 'n plaas grootgeword. My grootste speelmaat was  een  van  die
plaaswerkers se seuns. Dit was nie vir my snaaks om met 'n buiteband  en  'n
stok saam met hom te moes speel nie. Dit was nie vir my  snaaks  om  met  'n
draadkar saam met my speelmaat te speel nie. Dit was ook nie vir  my  snaaks
om na 'n reënstorm met my swart maat in die  modderpoele  kaalbas  te  speel
nie. Ons mag dit nie eintlik gedoen het nie, want dit  was  gevaarlik.  Daar
was goeie verhoudinge gewees. Ek is nie toegelaat om as  'n  kind  parmantig
te wees met enige plaaswerker nie, want dan het my pa my 'n pak slae  gegee.
Ek het geleer daar is iets soos wedersydse respek.

In meeste van  die  gevalle  betreffende  plaaswerkers  is  daar  wedersydse
respek en is daar vertroue tussen werkgewer  en  werknemer.  Ek  wil  vandag
waarsku: As die politici gaan misbruik maak van enkele gevalle om  rassehaat
aan te blaas om van enkele voorbeelde te veralgemeen, dan is hulle oppad  om
politiek te bedryf soos Mugabe dit doen en sodoende rassehaat aan  te  jaag.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairman, the FF is in favour of the quality of  life
of farm and domestic workers being improved and raised. Today I want to  put
it very clearly that politicians should stop  taking  isolated  cases  where
things  went  wrong  concerning  farm  workers   and   elevating   them   to
generalisations.

I too grew up on a farm. My best playmate was one of the farmworkers'  sons.
It was not out of the ordinary for me to play with a tyre and a stick  along
with him and neither was it out of the ordinary for me  to  play  with  cars
made out of wire along with my playmate; nor was it out of the ordinary  for
my black playmate and I to play naked in the mud pools  after  a  rainstorm.
We were not really supposed to  do  that  because  it  was  dangerous.  Good
relations existed. As a child I was not allowed to be impertinent  with  any
farmworker, because If I did so my father would give me  a  hiding.  I  have
learned that there is something like mutual respect.

In most of the cases regarding farm workers, there  is  mutual  respect  and
trust between employer and employee. I want to issue  a  stern  warning:  If
the politicians are going to abuse the isolated incidents to fan the  flames
of racial hatred by generalising these individual examples,  then  they  are
on the way to practising politics like Mugabe  and  in  so  doing  they  are
inciting hatred amongst the races. [Interjections.]]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, the domestic workers in South Africa  have
in the past and in the present situation, despite the  fact  that  there  is
now legislation that provides for their minimum  payment,  continued  to  be
exploited in the light of new regimes and  basic  conditions  of  employment
that regulate the labour market.

The implication of this violation of their rights is that  they  are  denied
the opportunity to enjoy the same freedom that we all  enjoy.  Many  do  not
earn a decent salary which is suitable to  maintain  themselves,  let  alone
their families. It is not a secret that the  majority  of  workers  in  this
sector happen to be women who are, in  most  cases,  breadwinners  in  their
families.

We have just emerged from the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development  and
it is not  coincidental  that  the  outcome  of  that  gathering  identified
poverty as a major threat to our  world  population,  and  the  majority  of
people who are affected are women and children.  If  we  are  to  halve  the
current poverty, we have to improve the quality of life of domestic  workers
and others in a similar category, who are struggling but are working.

As South Africans, in particular, leaders and employers in this  sector,  we
have to sensitise ourselves to the fact that we have the  responsibility  to
be exemplary, by treating our workers with dignity. We have the solution  to
the problem affecting these workers. Let us do  our  bit  to  improve  their
lifestyle. To achieve the objective of better lives  for  these  workers  in
this sector, employers should create  a  conducive  working  environment  in
meeting the needs of their employees. This can be  achieved  in  many  ways.
The basic income of domestic workers can be supplemented by  other  benefits
such as helping to educate the children of those workers. [Time expired.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Mr Chairperson, I want to start by commending  the  Minister
of Labour for announcing a minimum wage for domestic workers. It is a  start
and will certainly lead to some improvement. Therefore, we must  also,  like
others, appeal to our members of Parliament to uphold the standards and  not
violate them.

I also want to ask the Minister of Labour: When will he announce  a  minimum
wage for farmworkers, and also whether the proposal that  they  are  working
on includes seasonal workers on farms? The reason I ask is that on  National
Women's Day, on 9 August, I  attended  a  march  in  Stellenbosch.  Seasonal
workers were campaigning for R50 a day. Now, really, one cannot do  anything
with R50 a day.

Two weeks ago, with the hon Gavin Woods, we decided to  visit  some  of  the
good farms in the area. We visited the Kanonkop, Delheim Estate  and  Graham
Beck's farm which is close to Robertson.
We must encourage the farmers that are paying more to their workers to  talk
to the other farmers and encourage  them  to  do  the  same.  We  must  also
encourage distillers to develop a code of conduct and  ethics  because  they
buy grapes from all these farmers, and if the farmers  do  not  comply  with
that code of ethics, they should not buy from them.

Gavin and I also found that the SA Wine Trust has collapsed, because of  the
failure of the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs to appoint the  new
trustees. Currently, we have about R10,9 million plus R12,5 million  in  the
fund. Since June the Wine Trust has not been able to make  funds  available.
We appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs  to  appoint  new
trustees and farmworkers as trustees to the trust.

I also want to commend the NGO, Women on Farms Project, for  the  work  that
they are doing on farms to empower women and to strengthen the  capacity  of
women on farms.

Mr  S  A  MSHUDULU:  Chairperson,  the  hon  the  Minister,   hon   members,
distinguished guests,  domestic  workers,  farmworkers  and  all  vulnerable
workers out there, I greet you all on behalf of the ANC.  It  is  an  honour
for me to stand here.

Allow me to adopt a strategic approach to this matter, that  will  not  only
focus on challenges but on the history that has  created  this  category  of
workers. The present situation and environment has led to the ANC coming  up
with policies and measures to address these anomalies.

I stand  here  as  a  member  of  a  generation  born  of  grandfathers  and
grandmothers who owned everything: land,  farms,  stock  and  all  that  man
needed. They had confidence,  dignity,  ubuntu  and  their  communal  social
system was viable and equitable. Family life was unaltered and undiluted  by
foreign cultures and practices. Productivity was not defined by  an  English
dictionary but understood the African way, and there was no class struggle.

When colonialists came here, to Africa, new concepts were ushered  in  which
were detrimental to our social system. Firstly, the land,  where  everything
belonged, was taken by force. The  tax  system  was  imposed  to  force  the
dispossessed to go to towns to work in order to pay tax.  Assets  that  were
owned were taken through wars and some were cut.  Women  and  children  were
left desolate as men were recruited to mines  on  a  contract  system.  Thus
families were broken and no respect or dignity was left for them.

What I am trying to explain is that, for colonialists to control  everybody,
they had to break the power our grandfathers  and  grandmothers  had,  which
was land ownership, cattle, stock and farms. The  relationship  between  the
employer  and  employees  is  about  the  means  of  production  and   power
relations. Because  of  the  above-mentioned  background,  our  fathers  and
mothers were  reduced  to  workers  who  begged  for  food  and  work  after
everything they had was dispossessed. To  legitimise  this  evil,  both  the
British and the Boers excluded blacks in the constitution of the land.  This
gave rise to the Land Act of 1913.

The birth of the ANC, in 1912, was a direct response to the planning of  the
Land Act which aimed to remove land  ownership  from  Africans  in  all  but
proclaimed reserves which were  called  homelands.  The  ANC's  focus,  from
inception, was on resistance  and  the  restoration  of  land  and  property
rights.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  the  collective
noise that you are making is cancelling out what the member  at  the  podium
is attempting to say.

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Chairperson, workers in general are those people  who  will
sell their labour for payment. The classification of  workers  is  based  on
the value attached to one's labour. In order not to  pay  much,  less  value
was attached by capitalists to  the  job  that  one  did.  Even  today,  the
farmworkers, the domestic workers and other  blue-collar  workers  are  paid
less because less value is attached to their  job  descriptions  -  if  they
have any, of course, as this  is  seen  as  not  necessary.  What  is  being
ignored today is that the productivity, success  and  profits  of  those  in
power cannot be realised without these workers' input.

If one of us, for instance, is in a top position and he is  very  productive
at work, preparation for work starts early in the morning  where  one  needs
to have a bath, clean clothes, an immaculate dress code,  a  clean  car  and
breakfast. This first phase of production which has  contributed  to  mental
and physical preparedness is counted in favour of this  successful  man  and
not the domestic worker. Bonuses and promotions that might come  because  of
this domestic worker will not benefit the domestic worker. A  lot  has  been
said.

A farmworker, when a farm has to be ploughed and stock herded,  is  seen  as
the one who is responsible for that. But, when stock grows and  there  is  a
lot  of  milk  and  harvest,  credit  goes  to  the  employer  and  not  the
farmworker. In South African  workplaces,  today,  credit  for  productivity
always goes to middle or top management. It is argued that production is  as
a result of their good boardroom planning and  innovation,  based  on  sound
product management. When productivity declines,  they  are  not  answerable.
But, it is the vulnerable blue-collar worker  who  is  blamed  and  ends  up
being retrenched.

Because of the apartheid  nationalist  government's  exclusion  of  domestic
workers, farmworkers and vulnerable workers in the labour laws, the  ANC-led
Government, which took power in 1994, gave priority to the plight  of  these
workers. This is confirmed by the Constitution of South  Africa,  which  was
adopted in 1996.

Chapter 1, section 2 stipulates the supremacy of the Constitution.  It  says
that laws or conduct which  are  inconsistent  with  it,  are  invalid,  and
obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled. Section 9,  on  equality,  says
that no person may unfairly  discriminate  directly  or  indirectly  against
anyone, on any grounds. National legislation must be enacted to  prevent  or
prohibit unfair discrimination, hence the Employment Equity Act was  put  in
place. On human dignity, everyone has inherent  dignity  and  the  right  to
have their dignity respected and protected.

Section 23 deals with workers'  rights.  Everyone  has  the  right  to  fair
labour practices. Every worker has the  right  to  form  and  join  a  trade
union. All sections under the Bill of Rights apply to all,  including  these
workers. The ANC-led Government, through this Parliament, passed a law  that
protects all workers, including domestic workers and farmworkers.

This democracy brought real recognition for  this  category  of  workers  in
1996. In the Labour Relations  Act,  for  instance,  section  85  says  that
everyone has the right not to be unfairly dismissed. This Law  also  created
an institution called CCMA. This institution  has  helped  a  lot  of  these
vulnerable workers.

It was also common knowledge that, for Government to put measures in  place,
there must have been problems which had been  identified.  I  will  give  an
example of farmworkers. There is a study that has been done, which  reflects
that 70% of all farmworkers are male  and  are  relatively  young.  Children
living on commercial farms are more likely to be stunted and underweight.  A
third of the children are at risk of hunger. Poor quality housing  -  as  we
would know, the quality of housing symbolises the dignity of  workers  -  is
inconvenient,  unpleasant,  degrading  and  dehumanising.   Farmworkers,   I
repeat, have the worst rates of illiteracy in the country.

The average cash wage in agriculture is very  low.  Female  farmworkers  are
paid less than their male counterparts, and  the  gap  between  the  two  is
unacceptable. So, the history goes on. From the above evidence it  is  clear
that most South African farmworkers live  under  circumstances  of  absolute
and relative poverty.

Other serious observations are that the problems raised indicate the  extent
to  which  employment  in  agriculture  differs  from  employment  in  other
sectors, in terms of the extent of dependence of workers on  employers,  the
isolation of workers from the sources  of  information  and  social  support
beyond the farm and the significant obstacles to enable  workers  to  access
their labour rights. The same study was  undertaken  for  domestic  workers.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I know that hon  Middleton  is  quite  an  elderly
man, but I did not know that he was present when Jan  van  Riebeeck  arrived
400 years ago. [Laughter.]

One of the most vulnerable groups of workers in South Africa  today  is  the
white male group, a group whose members have to queue up at the back of  the
line, irrespective of merit, a vulnerability that has  caused  thousands  of
them to seek greener pastures abroad. I know that  this  group  is  not  the
focus of the debate today, but let us take care not to address the  problems
of one group and at the same time create a new group of vulnerable  workers.
As to domestic workers  and  farmworkers,  the  AEB  is  in  favour  of  the
improvement of their lives, working conditions  and  circumstances.  Surely,
there are examples of abuse,  of  unfavourable  terms  and  conditions  that
should be addressed. As a whole we are of the opinion that  the  scales  set
by the Minister is realistic. The Bible teaches us:

Die arbeider is sy loon  werd.  Die  AEB  waarsku  egter  dringend  teen  'n
legalistiese en wettiese afdwing daarvan, waarsku daarteen dat ons  soos  'n
bul  in  'n  porseleinwinkel  hierdie  terrein  bestorm,  waarsku  teen  die
herhaling van die 1812 Swart Omgang.  Hierdie  is  'n  saak  wat  met  groot
oorleg aangepak moet word. Die uitlig van enkele gevalle asof dit  die  reël
is en die kweek van 'n kultuur van onrus in  hierdie  mark,  gaan  die  mees
weerloosstes  die  swaarste  tref.  Die  onoordeelkundige  afdwing  van  die
maatreëls  gaan  lei  tot  afdankings,   groter   meganisering   en   groter
werkloosheid.

Ek kan vir u  talle  en  talle  gevalle  noem  van  goeie  verhoudinge,  van
gelukkige arbeiders, van die totale sorg in terme van onderwys,  gesondheid,
voeding, behuising en  vervoer  wat  nêrens  op  'n  betaalstaat  of  in  'n
dienskontrak verskyn nie. Daar is talle van wedersydse trou  en  lojaliteit.
Laat die uitstaande gevalle van misbruik en van die skending van  die  regte
van werkers aan die pen ry. Dit is reg so, maar maak  van  hierdie  saak  'n
politieke speelbal, skep 'n klimaat van  onrus  en  opstokery  en  die  mees
weerloosstes gaan die meeste daaronder ly. Daarenteen, versterk  'n  kultuur
van goeie  trou,  medemenslike  omgee,  waardering  en  lojaliteit  en  skep
sodoende 'n  situasie  waarin  niemand  sal  verloor  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The labourer is worthy of  his  hire.  The  AEB,  however,  urgently  warns
against its legalistic and rigid enforcement,  warns  against  our  storming
this territory like a bull in a china shop, warns against the repetition  of
the Black Circuit of 1812. This is an issue that must be handled with  great
care. The highlighting of single cases as if they  were  the  rule  and  the
cultivation of a culture of unrest in this market, will  have  the  greatest
impact on those who are the most vulnerable. The ill-considered  enforcement
of the measures will lead to retrenchments, greater mechanisation  and  more
unemployment.

I can mention numerous examples of good relations, of  happy  labourers,  of
total care in terms of education, health,  feeding,  housing  and  transport
that does not appear on any pay sheet or in any service contract. There  are
numerous examples of mutual faith and loyalty. Let the cases  that  are  the
exception with regard to abuse and  the  violation  of  workers'  rights  be
brought to book. That is rightly so, but if one makes a  political  football
of this issue and creates a  climate  of  unrest  and  agitation,  the  most
defenceless will suffer the most. On the other hand, reinforce a culture  of
good faith, humanitarian care, appreciation and  loyalty  and  in  so  doing
create a situation where no one is the loser.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The hon  Aucamp  might  like  to  know
that the hon Middleton has seen time both in the First  World  War  and  the
Second World War and he is probably as old as time in itself.
Mr S PILLAY: Mr Chairman, today we debate an issue that has to  be  managed.
There is no doubt about that. Poverty and unemployment need to be the  focus
of the Minister's activities. One of  the  major  problems  associated  with
domestic and farm work is the categorisation of that  type  of  work.  These
are essential tasks. I am certain there can be no argument on that score.

The labour portfolio committee has started visiting  farmworkers  and  I  am
hopeful that this process will continue throughout  the  country  to  ensure
that  conditions  of  employment  are  acceptable.  I  know  from   personal
experience how terrible conditions on some farms can be.  My  father  was  a
farmworker. I must add that not all domestic workers  and  farmworkers  work
under terrible conditions. Like every industry, there are  those  who  treat
the workers very badly and those who treat the workers properly. It  is  our
responsibility to ensure that the people who treat  their  workers  properly
are recognised and those that mistreat their workers  exposed  and  remedial
action taken.

It is a fact that there is a huge amount of physical work involved and  that
also requires skills. No household or farm work is easy to manage and  I  am
certain, again, that we all acknowledge that  fact.  When  we  look  at  our
neighbouring countries the importance of farmworkers  becomes  more  evident
to the unaware. One cannot play down the role of such work. Millions  starve
and die when the core of farmworkers is destroyed, and South  Africa  has  a
track record of its resilience and ability to survive and  manage  the  most
difficult situations.

The topic of discussion mentions workers and the implication  is  that  this
discussion revolves around those already employed. However, I would  suggest
that this debate would be incomplete if only the  employed  are  considered.
Consideration must be given to the unemployed who, when they enter the  work
place in these sectors, would also be vulnerable. Serious  thought  must  be
given to training to enable them to have more  employment  options.  Age  in
this instance should not be a consideration. In the areas of  Protea  North,
Lenasia, Lenasia South, Ennerdale,  Lawley,  Migson  Manor,  Wheelers  Farm,
Finetown and Orange Farm, the unemployment rate exceeds  75%,  according  to
our initial findings. Many of the people in the areas mentioned have  worked
in  the  domestic  environment,  farms  or  other  sectors  where  they  are
vulnerable. I urge the Minister to give  more  attention  to  ensuring  that
such people receive training to ensure that they have more options in  terms
of finding employment.

While we debate, there are many children somewhere that are starving as  the
parents or guardians are  paid  starvation  wages  as  clearly  shown  by  a
Special Assignment TV programme during this year. This  is  a  problem  that
does not need political grandstanding. It needs us as a nation to unite  and
acknowledge it as a problem and seek solutions to it. It  can  never  be  an
easy task to resolve.  However,  I  am  convinced  that  if  all  people  of
goodwill make a determined effort, we will find a solution.

Dr U ROOPNARAIN:  Mr  Chairman,  hon  members,  this  debate  indicates  the
seriousness that this House affords to the  issue  of  workers'  rights  and
social justice. Yesterday, the hon the Minister of Labour, in his  reply  to
a question, sang a song about  domestic  workers.  Today  I  would  like  to
borrow a quote from the hon the Minister. It reads like this:


  For domestic workers the struggle is not yet over until there is  action.
  The book on apartheid has been closed but there has been no  funeral,  we
  are the ones that can bury it.

This characterises the role that we, as political power  brokers,  can  play
in society. This interaction is important, because there  can  be  no  doubt
that domestic  workers  have  suffered  the  worst  working  conditions  and
treatment by employers. Very often domestic workers, for the sheer  fact  of
being women, are regarded in some paternalistic way as being  ``unskilled'',
``invisible'', ``domesticated''  and  as  ``nonproductive''.  This  type  of
thinking has been entrenched in our society and, hence, has devalued women.

Moreover, there is no shortage of examples of tyranny in the  backyard.  The
media has carried harrowing accounts of brutality  against  farmworkers  and
even child workers. Domestic workers are the most vulnerable  at  the  point
of employment, with no real bargaining or negotiating power. What  needs  to
happen? We need to break this vulnerability and provide legal protection.

The IFP welcomes any protective legislation or regulations that can be  used
as a tool or a weapon for vulnerable workers -  it  is  really  about  human
rights and their worth. Protective legislation will never succeed if  it  is
decided and dealt with in purely technical terms and in the  statute  books,
it needs to go beyond that. Hence, the key test  is:  Will  it  meaningfully
change and improve the lives of vulnerable workers?

It is up to us to stop the manifestation of  victimisation,  harassment  and
lack of respect for  the  sanctity  of  these  vulnerable  workers.  So,  we
applaud the Minister's efforts since, as vulnerable workers,  they  need  to
work in a  supportive,  fair  and  developmental  environment.  Any  act  of
victimisation or harassment is an act too many.

So, let me go back to the quote I began with:


  For domestic workers the struggle is not yet over until there is  action.
  The book on apartheid has been closed but there has been no  funeral,  we
  are the ones that can bury it.

I want to add to it. Let the epitaph read: Vulnerable workers  will  not  be
victimised, brutalised or terrorised. In short, it is finished. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Mr Chairperson, I want to thank the hon members  for
their support. This has been a very difficult process. It has taken us  more
than 30 months. Unfortunately, there are people who  think  that  it  is  an
easy matter and yet it is a very difficult one.

Today, I would like to dedicate this short speech of  mine  to  the  gallant
heroines of our struggle whose determination  for  freedom  caused  them  to
flood the streets of Pretoria as they marched  to  the  Union  Buildings  in
August 1956.  [Applause.]  I  speak  of  women  of  South  Africa  who  from
generation to generation passed  on  the  baton  of  the  struggle  for  the
liberation of our people. I speak of women whose quest for freedom,  justice
and equality subdued their fear of detention, torture, tear  gas,  even  for
death. Some of those women carried children on their backs as they  marched,
symbolising the burden they carried on a daily basis as  the  laws  of  this
country had reduced them into beasts of burden.

While we have indeed  conquered  the  apartheid  regime  and  established  a
democracy, many of the women of our land  continue  to  languish  under  the
crushing burden of poverty and underdevelopment. Many of  these  women  work
in our homes as domestic workers.

They look after our children so that we may be able to earn an income.  They
clean our houses, so that we may enjoy a healthy life. They  cook  our  food
so that we may live. They wash and iron our clothes so that we may  look  as
presentable as many hon members are  today.  Yet,  despite  the  significant
contribution they make  to  the  economy  of  our  country,  many  of  these
backroom  operators,  whose  contribution  is  undervalued  and   on   whose
sacrifices so many of us depend, are  the  most  exploited  workers  in  the
labour  market.  That  is  why  we  had  to  come  up  with   the   sectoral
determination.

Our  research  has  revealed  that  many  domestic  workers  work  long  and
unregulated hours with inadequate rest periods. Many of them  do  not  enjoy
paid sick leave or annual leave and  are  paid  meagre  salaries.  In  other
words, the provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment  Act  which  are
aimed at providing a floor of rights for  workers  are  inadequate  to  deal
with the unique circumstances of domestic workers. I want to plead with  the
hon members to read this little booklet very carefully.  It  does  not  only
talk  about  where  one  must  benchmark  wages  but  it  also  talks  about
conditions.

Of course, I know, like the big-mouthed hon member, that there  are  parties
who went to poor areas and instigated people to mobilise  themselves,  march
to the offices of the Department of Labour  and  demand  the  observance  of
their rights. It will not happen,  precisely  because  the  Constitution  of
this country allows us to do these things. I want to make an appeal  to  hon
members that they should welcome the fact that  a  minimum  wage  remains  a
basic minimum wage.

I have no qualms, problems or difficulties with  those  who  are  paying  R2
000,00 a month to their domestic workers. I do not quarrel  with  those  who
pay R1 500,00 either. But I do quarrel with those who pay R250,00  a  month.
[Applause.] I quarrel with those who either pay R300,00 or R400,00 a month.

All I am saying is that in a municipality like Cape Town, which is what  the
sectoral determination is saying, one should not pay less  than  R800,00  to
domestic workers. Members should see this as a tool and a weapon.

Unfortunately, many people think that the Minister of  Labour  is  going  to
knock at 930 000 homes. No, this tool must be used so that we  are  able  to
say there is now a sectoral  determination  for  domestic  workers  in  that
home.

The hon member from the DP, Clelland-Stokes, said that the domestic  workers
are going to be fired. We are aware that there are cruel people.  I  am  not
saying that all people in this country are good people of God. I  know  that
there are cruel people  who  will  fire  their  domestic  workers  but  this
document is not the reason to fire domestic workers. Because, if  one  reads
this document, it states that one can vary the working hours.

There is no need for one to make a domestic worker work for 60 or  80  hours
a week. One can always vary the times. If one  looks  at  this  document  it
states that one can even make one's domestic worker work 27 hours and  less,
a week. If one makes one's domestic worker work 27 hours and  more  a  week,
then one must follow these rules.  It  is  very  simple  and  is  in  simple
English and the member speaks so much English. This is very simple  English.
He needs to understand it. He must not encourage employers to fire  domestic
workers. [Applause.] Instead, he should encourage  them  to  pay  more  than
what the sectoral determination requires them to.

I am making an appeal here. Today, domestic workers  arrived  in  my  office
because a member of this House - that is what they said  and  I  am  looking
for the truth and I hope I will get it -  has  fired  his  or  her  domestic
worker. They came to my office and I am still tracing the  person  who  took
the domestic workers to my office. As soon as I get that person hon  members
will know. In fact, I do not have to name anybody, but the  domestic  worker
will do so. [Interjections.]  They  will  definitely  do  so.  Many  of  the
members think that domestic workers are ``domkoppe''. Hulle is nie  domkoppe
nie. [They are not stupid.] They can speak and talk for themselves.

Actually, it is women who marched to Pretoria, not  men.  It  is  women  who
initiated the system that enabled  all  of  us  to  no  longer  carry  those
dompasses around our necks - it is women. [Applause.] I am sure that  women,
again, are going to win.

There is one thing that we must also understand, this minimum wage is  going
to be increased by 8% annually. Therefore, my friend  must  understand  that
this is going up and not going down.  It  also  has  a  life-span.  After  a
certain period, we will have to review this sectoral determination. That  is
how it works.

I am appealing to hon members to understand that if they say  that  this  is
too little, then they need  to  be  exemplary.  One  should  say:  What  the
Minister is determining as minimum wage is too little, therefore I am  going
to pay my domestic worker R10 000 a  month.  There  is  nothing  wrong  with
that, regarding hon Middleton. I would really  kiss  him,  and  I  will  not
mention where I would kiss him. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

We will also determine minimum wages for farmworkers  as  well.  I  will  be
announcing  a  sectoral  determination  for  farmworkers  very  soon.  I  am
convinced, regarding hon Groenewald, that it  has  nothing  to  do  with  my
politics. [Interjections.] Hon Groenewald  does  not  know  my  politics,and
when he knows them he will be sorry. It has  to  do  with  the  way  farmers
treat farmworkers. [Interjections.] Yes, I agree with hon Groenewald.  There
are farmers who treat farmworkers very well  and  I  have  visited  some  of
those farms. But, there are bad farmers too.

Unfortunately, the bad farmer is the one who is damaging the  good  farmer's
image in this country. Must we allow the bad farmer to thrive  in  the  name
of the good  farmer?  No,  we  cannot  do  that.  Certainly,  this  sectoral
determination will not affect a good farmer.  It  will  only  affect  a  bad
farmer. Because here we are talking about the basic conditions of  work  for
farmworkers.

When I visited the farms, I went to one farm in  Limpopo.  The  people  were
complaining there. Farmworkers asked us the whereabout of this freedom  that
we are talking about. In 1994, they were told to go  and  vote.  They  voted
and there was a new democracy - a new South Africa. On their farms there  is
no new South Africa. [Interjections.] The people that  I  am  talking  about
are employees in the  houses  of  these  hon  members.  They  are  the  ones
complaining.  Some  hon  members  have  farms  -  by  the  way.  People  are
complaining that they do not see any freedom, which is what they  voted  for
on 27 April 1994.

So, I want to thank those hon members who really see the light. Indeed,  the
route that we are taking is correct and we  are  on  course  to  better  the
lives of our people. Hon members must read the ANC manifesto which  says  we
shall  make  sure  that  we  protect  the  vulnerable  workers.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 18:45.
