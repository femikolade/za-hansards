                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die  volgende
sittingsdag gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Nuwe NP met groot waardering kennis geneem het  van  die  SAL  se
       onlangs vrygestelde jaarverslag waaruit dit onder meer blyk dat -


       (a)  die SAL in die  afgelope  boekjaar  daarin  geslaag  het  om  'n
           wesensverlies van R998 miljoen in  die  vorige  boekjaar  om  te
           swaai in 'n wins van  R553  miljoen,  in  teenstelling  met  die
           meeste  van  die  ander  internasionale  lugrederye,  wat  groot
           verliese getoon het in dieselfde boekjaar;


       (b)  die inkomste uit  passasiersbedrywighede  met  25,8%  tot  R11,2
           miljoen toegeneem het ten spyte van die New York-tragedie van 11
           September 2001, sowel as stygende brandstofpryse; en


       (c)  die inkomste van die tegniese afdeling, wat een van die beste in
           die wêreld is, met 54,6% tot R532 miljoen gestyg het vir dienste
           gelewer ten opsigte van die herstel en opgradering van vliegtuie
           vir ander internasionale lugrederye wêreldwyd; en


  (2) die Nuwe NP, soos almal  in  die  Raad,  baie  trots  is  op  hierdie
       wonderlike prestasie en die  Hoof-  Uitvoerende  Beampte,  mnr  André
       Viljoen, en sy bestuurspan gelukwens met die wonderlike prestasie wat
       hulle behaal het sonder hulp uit die buiteland.

[Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chair, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) the New NP has noted with great appreciation the  recently  published
       annual report of the SAA, from which it  is  evident,  among  others,
       that -


       (a)  in the past financial year the SAA has managed  to  transform  a
           material loss of R998 million in  the  previous  financial  year
           into a profit of R553 million, in contrast to most of the  other
           international airlines, which have shown big losses in the  same
           financial year;


       (b)  revenue from commuter activities increased with 25,8%  to  R11,2
           million in spite of the New York tragedy of 11 September 2001 as
           well as increased fuel prices; and


       (c)  revenue from the technical division, which is one of the best in
           the world, increased by  54,6%  to  R532  million  for  services
           rendered in respect of the repairs and upgrading  of  aeroplanes
           for other international airlines worldwide; and


  (2) the New NP, like everyone in the  Council,  is  very  proud  of  this
       marvellous achievement and congratulates the Chief Executive Officer,
       Mr André   Viljoen, and his management team on  having  performed  so
       remarkably without foreign assistance.]

                 POLICE SUCCESSES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the newly appointed Minister of  Safety  and  Security,
       Charles Nqakula, and his department on their series of  successes  in
       the fight against illegal drug manufacturing and smuggling  in  South
       Africa;


  (2)  lauds  their  latest  seizing  of   imported   Mandrax-manufacturing
       equipment and chemicals to the value of R320  million,  bringing  the
       total amount of similar equipment and chemicals seized over the  last
       month to almost four billion rand;
 (3)  expresses the hope that these victories, which rank among the biggest
       drug busts in the world, will dispel notions that our  country  is  a
       safe haven and transit point for organised crime syndicates; and


  (4) believes that these operations will ensure that the availability  and
       use of drugs such as Mandrax is beyond  the  reach  of  our  township
       pedlars and users.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                           NCOP SITTING IN UMTATA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat -
       (a)  die Nasionale  Raad  van  Provinsies  verlede  week  geskiedenis
           gemaak het deur 'n sitting in Umtata te hou;


       (b)  die eerste keer wat die Parlement elders gesit het  in  1864  te
           Grahamstad, ook in die Oos-Kaap, was en dat  die  Parlementslede
           toe ses dae per ossewa daarheen gereis het;


       (c)  baie huidige lede van die Raad byna net so  lank  per  motor  en
           vliegtuig gereis het, maar dat die ontwikkeling sedert 1864  tog
           duidelik waarneembaar is;


       (d)  tydens die Anglo-Boereoorlog in 1901 'n Parlementêre sitting ook
           buite Kaapstad gehou is; en


       (e)  die resultaat van die poging om die Parlement na  die  mense  te
           neem, sekerlik in die toekoms beleef sal word; en


  (2) aanvaar dat die beplanning vir die besoek aan  die  ander  provinsies
       sal put uit die ondervinding van hierdie afgelope sitting en dat meer
       oorlegpleging met lede en die swepery 'n aanwins sal wees.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I shall move at the next  sitting  of  the
House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the National Council of Provinces  made  history  last  week  by
           holding a sitting in Umtata;


       (b)   the  first  time  Parliament  sat  elsewhere  was  in  1864  in
           Grahamstown, also in the Eastern Cape, and that at the time  the
           journey there took Members of Parliament six days in ox wagons;
       (c)  the journey by car and aeroplane took many  present  members  of
           the Council nearly as long, but that development since  1864  is
           nonetheless clearly apparent;


       (d)  during the Anglo-Boer War in 1901 a  Parliamentary  sitting  was
           also held outside of Cape Town; and


       (e)  the result of the effort to take Parliament to the  people  will
           surely be experienced in the future; and


  (2) accepts that the planning for the visit to the other  provinces  will
       gain  from  the  experience  of  this  past  sitting  and  that  more
       consultation with members and the whippery will be an asset.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

         PERFORMANCE OF TEAM SOUTH AFRICA AT THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with a  sense  of  great  national  pride  and  excitement  the
       collective  heroic  performances  of  Team  South   Africa   at   the
       Commonwealth Games which was held in Manchester,  England,  over  the
       past two weeks;


  (2) further notes that their total medal haul comprising  of  nine  gold,
       twenty silver and seventeen bronze medals is  twelve  more  than  the
       total won at the Malaysian Games in 1998 and enough to  ensure  fifth
       place out of a total of seventy-two nations that competed;


  (3) acknowledges the successes achieved by the Department  of  Sport  and
       Recreation  South  Africa  since  1992  in  promoting  sport  in  all
       communities, including disabled communities; and


  (4) commends the South African Commonwealth  Games  Association  and  the
       South African Sports Commission on their commitment  and  enthusiasm,
       which ensured the exposure and reflection of our unique South African
       winning spirit in the international sporting arena.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         A TRIBUTE TO SARA BAARTMAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Deputy Minister, our sister and  comrade  Bridgette
       Mabandla, on her extensive research, interviews and preparations,  as
       well as the various hearings she held to ensure that the  remains  of
       our beloved daughter of the soil, Sara Baartman, are returned to  her
       motherland, le fa a tla a setse a na le maina a bokgoba, eseng a  Se-

       her African names];

       they came to know her, and when they talk about their culture];

       be interred this coming Friday].

Ke kopa gore Khansele eno e amogele tshitshinyo eno, le fa ke sa  ba  itsisa

not inform it on time].

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Any objection?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, although we do not object to  the  contents
of the motion, the Rules explicitly say that a motion cannot  be  put  if  a
debate on that specific topic is going to follow.

For that reason, I object.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  We  are  going
to debate this matter in the next  few  minutes.  Rev  Chabaku's  motion  is
intended to congratulate the Minister. It is not on the  substantive  issues
that are going to be debated, but on the steps that the Minister  has  taken
to ensure that what we are going to debate takes place.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr N M RAJU: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): You  wanted  to  speak
on sport, I believe? [Laughter.]

No, it is all right, Mr Raju, let us proceed.

                 BESKIKBAARHEID VAN ANTIRETROVIRALE MIDDELS

                               (Konsepbesluit)

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem dat-
  (1)  alle  moontlike  middels  wat  kan   help   om   die   skrikwekkende
       MIV/vigspandemie te beveg en om die dodelike  virus  se  oordrag  aan
       onskuldige babas te beperk, vir alle gewone burgers  beskikbaar  moet
       wees;


  (2) volgens alle aanduidings wêreldwyd, Nevirapine  steeds  een  van  die
       beste hulpmiddels is om te verhoed dat  hierdie  vloek  die  volgende
       geslagte tref;


  (3) die Nuwe NP besorg is oor die hardnekkige gerugte wat tans  weer  die
       rondte doen dat middels soos Nevirapine giftig is en dus onttrek moet
       word; en


  (4) die Nuwe NP die hoop uitspreek dat hierdie  middels  saam  met  ander
       beskikbaar sal bly totdat meer  geskikte  alternatiewe  voorsien  kan
       word.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) all possible remedies that can help to combat the  terrible  HIV/Aids
       pandemic and to limit the transmission of the fatal virus to innocent
       babies, should be available to all ordinary citizens;


  (2) according to all indications worldwide, Nevirapine is  still  one  of
       the best means to prevent this curse from being visited on  the  next
       generations;


  (3) the New NP is concerned over the persistent rumours doing the  rounds
       once again  that  remedies  like  Nevirapine  are  toxic  and  should
       therefore be withdrawn; and


  (4) the New NP  expresses  the  hope  that  these  remedies  will  remain
       available along with others until more suitable alternatives  can  be
       supplied.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Any objection to the motion?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Ek maak beswaar teen die voorstel, mnr die  Voorsitter.  [I
object to the motion, Mr Chairprson.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: In the light of the objection, the  motion  may
not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will then become  a  notice
of motion.

Are there any further motions without notice? There is  none.  We  will  now
proceed to the subject as printed on the Order Paper, namely Sara  Baartman:
An epitome of the restoration of  human  dignity  against  a  background  of
gender and racial discrimination.

I take this opportunity to welcome the hon  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology, to the NCOP and call upon  her  to  address
the House.

   SARA BAARTMAN: AN EPITOME OF THE RESTORATION OF HUMAN DIGNITY AGAINST A
               BACKGROUND OF GENDER AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

                          (Subject for discussion)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
hon members, our President, the hon Mr Mbeki, has eloquently said that  Sara
Baartman's  return  is  profoundly  significant   because   her   experience
symbolises the inter-relationship of gender oppression, colonialisation  and
racial exploitation.

Indeed, Miss Baartman's return and the process that  enabled  this  historic
occurrence give us room for hope and inspire us for the future, just as  the
past and the sad tale of her life make us look at the  colonial  times  with
horror.

Before I engage with the body of my speech, let me just confirm a fact  that
many members may know. As per the decision  of  the  reference  group,  Miss
Baartman shall be referred to, from now on, as Sara Baartman and not in  the
diminutive Dutch name that was appended to her. According to my  dictionary,
something that is diminutive indicates a small size and sometimes the  state
or quality of being lovable, despicable or contemptible. This certainly  may
have been in the mind-set of those who took  Miss  Baartman  to  Europe  and
those who exhibited her naked for others to gape at and  perhaps  those  who
went to view her. Yet, there was nothing contemptible  or  small  in  spirit
about this brave young woman, taken  to  foreign  lands  by  sea  and  being
unfamiliar with the language of her tormentors.

As the tale of the life of Sara Baartman will always reinforce  the  dangers
of gender, racial and ethnic oppression,  so  too  will  the  story  of  her
return serve to affirm the strides that  have  been  made  in  international
understanding and mutual respect since those times. As we  approach  Women's
Day on 9 August, we have much to  celebrate  in  assessing  the  significant
changes and  improvements  that  have  occurred,  especially  in  overcoming
racial and gender discrimination. This  is  most  marked  in  South  Africa,
where we have emerged from decades of legally enforced discrimination  to  a
place in which countries around the world look  to  us  in  celebrating  the
victory of truth, justice and reconciliation over the forces of evil. It  is
most fitting that Sara Baartman is being given the  respectful  burial  that
she did not receive upon her death. This will  happen  on  National  Women's
Day, a day dedicated to the courage, conviction and tenacity  of  the  women
of South Africa. Our women have  played  a  central  role  in  changing  our
country for the better and working conscientiously for  a  better  life  for
all. The historic 1956 antipass march to the  Union  Buildings  was  led  by
women from a number of cultures, all of them  South  Africans  in  the  true
sense of the word, and one of them serves in our reference group: Ms  Sophie
de Bruin.

I urge all members to participate actively  and  to  ensure  that,  at  both
provincial and national levels, the communities of South  Africa  engage  in
making  the  national  Women's  Month,  with  the  theme  ``Putting  women's
empowerment at the heart  of  Africa's  reconstruction,  respect  our  human
rights, restore our dignity'' a success. A number  of  events  have  already
occurred, but there are many more that members can participate in.

A host of partners, Government institutions and departments  are  mobilising
and marking this month, illustrating our  commitment  to  upholding  women's
rights. Lest the glow of our  success  and  triumphs  in  throwing  off  the
fetters of gender and racial discrimination blind us to the challenges  that
we must still face, let me remind members  of  some  sobering  words.  These
words were quoted at the enrobement ceremony of Sara Baartman on  4  August,
which was held here in Cape Town at the Civic Centre.

Charlotte Maxeke said, almost a 100 years ago, that disease, poverty  and  a
lack of learning are destroying our families.  I  believe  that  this  is  a
challenge that we still face today. These obstacles to stability,  equality,
and human dignity are still with us. Sadly, around the  world  it  is  often
the women who carry the greatest burden as  a  result  of  the  scourges  of
poverty, illiteracy and disease. These are the girlchildren  who  are  taken
from school to work in the house and tend the family and the women who  must
shoulder the burden of the home and care for the sick and  elderly.  Let  us
look to the future. Let us take into our communities the  message  that  the
onus is on each and every one of us to change our world for the better.

We  live  in  a  country  with  possibilities;  with  the  most  enlightened
Constitution in the world. Let us  work  in  this  enabling  environment  to
realise the  African  dream,  crown  the  African  Union  with  success  and
challenge the burden of poverty of  the  so-called  Third  World  countries.
When we consider the concept of the  restoration  of  human  dignity,  words
that  spring  to  mind  include  ubuntu,   co-operation,   mutual   respect,
tolerance, equality and, indeed, freedom. How can we  have  dignity  without
freedom?

I spoke in the National Assembly on the remarkable process  of  co-operation
encapsulating the aforementioned characteristics that  marked  the  historic
return of Sara Baartman to her home when I delivered my budget  speech.  But
today I am proud to outline the proactive and  positive  action  and  inter-
action that facilitated and enabled this affirmation of human  dignity.  The
Sara Baartman story itself is the embodiment of the fight against  injustice
and oppression,  the  battle  to  ensure  the  universal  respect  of  human
dignity, the indelible cognisance of cultural and gender equality against  a
background of gender and racial discrimination.

It gives me great pleasure to note that an integral part of the process  was
a work of art, an eloquent and  moving  poem  by  Diana  Ferrus.  Ms  Ferrus
herself embodies the compassion and insight that we,  the  citizens  of  the
world, need if we are truly to overcome the  forces  of  gender  and  racial
discrimination. Such is the power of art and words that Miss  Ferrus's  poem
has made legislative history in France.  Its  translated  verses  have  been
incorporated into the enabling law that  relieves  Sara  Baartman  from  her
exile and  humiliation  and  has  made  her,  and  the  landmark  action  to
repatriate her back to her people, an epitome of the  restoration  of  human
dignity against a background of past gender and racial discrimination.

Sara Baartman stands as an ultimate symbol of the evils of both  gender  and
racial discrimination. If she had lived in another time or had  not  been  a
woman and an African during the period of colonialisation,  it  is  possible
that she would have  escaped  the  harsh  treatment  that  she  experienced.
Although the current government of France, its people and  the  scholars  of
Britain are not to blame for the prejudiced treatment  which  Sara  Baartman
received in Europe from 1810 to  1815,  the  role  of  past  colonialism  is
unquestionable. But  in  our  rapidly  globalising  world,  Sara  Baartman's
return to the shores of South Africa stands as  a  supreme  example  of  the
increasing insight and co-operation that exist between  nations.  No  longer
should one nation  be  perceived  to  be  dominating  another.  Indeed,  the
essence of intergovernmental relations in most cases is one of  partnership,
co-operation  and  mutual  agreement.  This  is   best   expressed   through
international fora such as the UN. I shall touch on this point  at  a  later
stage.

Let me first recap on the wonderful joint action that  freed  Sara  Baartman
from her captivity. As the poem bears testimony  to  the  power  of  art  to
change  the  world,  so  too  does  technology,   specifically   information
technology, enable the rapid dissemination of information that can and  does
in itself  change  the  world.  For  when  information  and  access  to  new
understanding of other people's viewpoints and  cultures  lead  to  insight,
acceptance and respect, the effects can  be  incredibly  positive  and  very
powerful. Once more it is fitting for the mandate of the  Ministry  I  serve
that technology was the key to unlocking the second door on Sara  Baartman's
long journey to freedom.

Madame Ferrus's poem is on a website visited by one Anna Sophia  Parisot  in
France. Miss Parisot was deeply moved by the eloquence of the poem  and  the
longing for home and the peace of which it spoke.  She  brought  it  to  the
attention of Senator Abou, to whom she  is  a  personal  assistant.  Senator
Abou was proactive and took the process forward and sponsored the bill  that
enabled the release of Sara Baartman. This implicitly acknowledges  that  we
as a species have evolved to a  point  where  we  understand  the  need  for
redress and restoring human dignity in the many instances in  which  it  has
been diminished or ignored in the past.

In explaining how he come to be involved  in  Sara's  cause,  this  is  what
Senator Abou said in the senate:


  Her story is very sad. I was filled with indignation, indignation for her
  past. How could a woman, a human being, be so badly treated?

In further illustrating the role of co-operation and  partnership  which  is
so important to the journey home of Sara Baartman, let me inform members  of
the roles of some of the other  people  involved.  The  French  minister  of
research, Schwartzenberg, affirmed the right of all of  the  world's  people
to human dignity during a moving address at the handing-over ceremony.  This
is what he said: ``After suffering from so many insults, Sara Baartman  will
at last have her dignity restored,  following  a  dark  period  of  slavery,
colonialism and racism''. By making her free, we make  ourselves  freer.  By
paying this tribute to her, France is paying a tribute to freedom,  equality
and brotherhood. This bears testimony to what I have been saying on how  the
international co-operation surrounding the  repatriation  of  Sara  Baartman
makes the event the epitome of the restoration of human  dignity,  in  which
the shackles of racial and gender oppression and  discrimination  should  be
thrown off forever.

Let  me  also  acknowledge  the  role  played  by   the   national   Khoisan
Consultative Conference who, of course, have  been  in  discussion  with  us
regarding the return of the remains of Sara Baartman from as early as  1996.
I would also like to  mention  our  former  ambassador  to  France,  Barbara
Masekela, who also enabled Professor Tobias, who acted as  a  go-between  in
discussions with his peers at the  university  and  the  Museum  of  Man  to
negotiate the return of the remains of Sara Baartman from 1996.

There is a lesson in all of this. We, as a people  in  transition,  have  to
acknowledge that we still have a long journey to  travel  and  that  we  are
still in transition. We have not yet overcome  the  obstacles  of  race  and
gender oppression. We need a critical mass of leaders such as  members.  Hon
members are here in this House as representatives of  the  people  of  South
Africa, elected in a proper way to represent our people.

This month, as we affirm our commitment to human rights, we  should  restate
our commitment to increasing the number of  people  and  enjoining  them  in
fighting for human rights and a just society in our country. We  should  say
no to violence against women and children. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushana): Hon members, there  are
continuous interruptions by cellphones. Please turn them  off.  I  will  not
hesitate to send you out. We now proceed with the proceedings.

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, on  Woman's  Day,  9
August 2002, Sara Baartman will be laid  to  rest  on  a  hill  outside  the
little town of Hankey in the Gamtoos Valley.

This is where she was born nearly two centuries ago.  Few  people  in  South
Africa's history could claim  to  have  led  a  life  that  personalise  the
struggle of its people with such honourable iconic status.

Sara Baartman is such an  icon  whose  image,  life,  death  and  posthumous
reverence have triumphed over racism, colonialism and sexism. She  was  born
in 1783 and spent her first 20  years  as  a  dignified  and  proud  Khoisan
woman. While working as a servant on a farm owned by Peter Cegar,  her  life
abruptly changed when, in 1810, she found  herself  on  a  boat  to  England
where she would be exhibited as a freak.

It was Alexander Dunlop and Peter  Cegar's  brother,  Hendrik,  who  started
this humiliating exhibit to the curious Europeans,  and  so  the  show,  ``A
freak of nature from Africa'', was born.  Baartman  was  stripped  of  human
rights, dignity and self-respect and paraded  near-naked  around  Piccadilly
Circus in London.

In 1814, at the request  of  a  scientist,  Etienne  Geoffrey  Alaine,  Sara
Baartman was taken to  France  and  became  the  object  of  scientific  and
medical research. At the age of 27  she  died,  probably  of  pneumonia,  in
exile - miles and miles away from her homeland and village.

On 21 February 2002  the  French  National  Assembly  voted  unanimously  to
repatriate the remains of Sara Baartman to South Africa. And  so  on  1  May
Sara Baartman came home. Home is where  her  heart  was  and  my  heart  is:
Hankey in the Gamtoos Valley.

Let us give hon members more information about Sara's place of rest.  Hankey
was established in 1826 and is the Gamtoos Valley's oldest  and  main  town.
It was named after the Rev William Allen Hankey, an ex-banker and  secretary
of the London Missionary Society.

The purpose of the establishment of the village  was  to  grow  mealies  and
corn for the London Missionary  Society's  main  station,  Bethelsdorp,  and
also to carry out evangelistic work. The town of Hankey was planned for  250
families but started with only 25 families. The first inhabitants  consisted
of a large number of Khoi, a few Mfengos, a few white farmers and a  mix  of
so-called ``Gamtouers''.

The London Missionary Society founded the station in 1822 and terminated  it
in 1875. The mission became a Congregational Church,  as  it  is  today.  Dr
John Philip was superintendent of the village. Some  of  the  residents  had
surnames such as Windvogel, Diederik, Abraham, Stuurman, Dragonder,  Armoed,
Scheepers and Constable. There were a few  farmers,  such  as  James  Waite,
Salmon  Ferreira  -  my  great-grandfather  -  and  the   Damant   brothers.
[Interjections.]

An irrigation scheme on the Gamtoos River  has  up  to  now  been  the  only
national monument in Hankey.  The  scheme  was  the  brainchild  of  William
Philip, son of the superintendent, Dr John Philip. His inspiration  was  the
``window'' in the mountain - a big hole through the  top  of  the  mountain.
The Gamtoos River flows past both sides of the mountain  and  then  makes  a
huge turn and forms a perfect inland peninsula. The tunnel  underneath  this
``window'' was dug using picks and shovels and wheelbarrows. The  length  of
the tunnel is 240 metres and the speed of the construction was very  slow  -
about half a metre per day. It was started in April 1843  and  completed  in
August 1844 - 15 months later. It was in use from  April  1845  to  1970,  a
period of 125 years. This was the first ever tunnel scheme in South Africa.

If Sara could rise from her grave today, she  would  see  a  prosperous  and
fertile green valley  of  golden  oranges,  naartjies,  orchards,  vegetable
lands and maize fields.

Many famous people have their roots in Hankey. Hankey has produced  lawyers,
doctors, specialists, reverends and dominees, teachers, educators and  well-
known sportsmen - there  is  a  Springbok  rugby  player  from  Hankey  too.
[Interjections.] The first college  for  coloured  teachers  was  the  Dower
College,  which  was  also  a  first  for  Hankey.  At  the   moment   three
parliamentarians, not to say they are amongst the  famous  Hankey  children,
have Hankey connections. Two of these, Mr Donald Lee and I,  were  born  and
bred in Hankey and Alwin Goosen of the NA was reverend in the famous  Hankey
Congregational Church.

Through the years Hankey has produced children the country can be proud  of.
It took Sara Baartman, two centuries later, really to  throw  the  spotlight
on this picturesque  little  town  between  the  mountains  in  the  Gamtoos
Valley. Her return to her hometown  provides  an  opportunity  for  symbolic
reparation,  because  of  her  life  as  a  victim  of  sexism,  racism  and
colonialism. She has become an international icon of restitution for  people
affected by colonialism.
Baartman's story has seized  the  imagination  of  peoples  all  around  the
world, including cultural workers. A poem about Sara, written  by  Ms  Diana
Ferrus, moved the French Senate and had a major influence in  Sara's  return
to South Africa.

Her grave will be a simple, traditional stone slab -  but  the  legacy  will
live on and on. Hankey's 160-year founders' monument,  the  largest  sundial
in South Africa, with a diameter of 34,6m, is at the  foot  of  this  koppie
where Sara will find her resting place. The turning dial will  be  there  to
remind us that the Sara Baartman legacy will live on to remind  us  that  at
last, we are all free. South Africa celebrates the  reinforcement  of  human
rights. [Applause.]

Nksz N D NTWANAMBI: Mhlalingaphambili, Sekela  Mphathiswa,  maqabane  noogxa
bam,  namhlanje  sithi:   Malibongwe   igama   lamakhosikazi.   [Uwelewele.]
Siyabulela  kuSekela  Mphathiswa  ongasilibalanga   isifungo   esathatyathwa
ngoomama  abafana  noLillian  Ngoyi,  uDorah  Tamana,   Helen   Joseph   ...
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)
[Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, Deputy Minister,  comrades  and  colleagues,
today we say: Malibongwe igama lamkhosikazi. [Interjections.] We  thank  the
hon the Deputy Minister for not forgetting the oath taken by women  such  as
Lillian Ngoyi, Dorah Tamana, Helen Joseph ... ]

... and many others whose energies brought us where we are today.

Sara Baartman toured Europe not because she so desired, but because a  cruel
doctor lured her. She was made a so-called African  Venus.  In  healing  the
continent, the department negotiated with the French authorities  to  return
her home. In the Minister's words;


  This is a process of restoring our nation's dignity and humanity.

I want to add that restoring  women's  rights  means  respecting  women  and
recognising their role in the society. Keeping an African woman naked  in  a
cage in a foreign country's museum like a monkey means ...

... ukungasiboni, ukungasikhathaleli nokungasazeli ntweni thina  makhosikazi
amnyama. [... thinking little of us and  showing  no  regard  for  us  black
women.]

Sara's structure was that of a typical African woman - from South to  North,
East to West. What we cannot forget, as African women, is that  Sara  was  a
Khoisan woman who became  an  icon  of  women's  oppression  and  injustices
committed during the colonial era.

Yiba  nombono  wenkosikazi  ekuhanjwa  kuboniswa  ngobuze   bayo   kwiindawo
ngeendawo  eLondon,  yaza  wagqibela   ngokuya   kugcinwa   eParis.   Ngenxa
yobunzima, asikwazi ukulibala  ukuba  wathengisa  ngomzimba  wakhe  ingeyiyo
intando yakhe, koko waye  onganyelwe  ziimeko  zokuphila.  Akahlonitshwa  ke
ngoku sele ebhubhile. Iindawo ezithile zomzimba wakhe  zafakwa  ezibhotileni
ukumgcina eMuziyam. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)
[Just imagine a woman being  paraded  in  the  nude  in  various  places  in
London, and then ultimately being taken to  Paris.  Owing  to  circumstances
beyond her control,  she  was  forced  into  prostitution.  She  was  denied
dignity even in her death. Her body parts were put in bottles and kept in  a
museum.]

I totally disagree with French researchers who said keeping Sara  in  France
was to restore her dignity and the humiliation she suffered as a  woman  and
an African. In death and humiliation, she has emerged as a  national  symbol
of an odious past and the need to  restore  dignity  to  all  women  of  our
country. The funeral on Friday will truly reflect the  new  South  Africa  -
the South  Africa  that  is  nonracial,  nonsexist;  that  cares  about  and
respects its womenfolk for who and what they are.

In conclusion, on the occasion of celebrating Women's  Day,  it  is  also  a
moment of great joy for Sara's descendants. In our lifetime  women's  rights
are recognised; our dignity is restored. Women  in  Africa  will  make  sure
that triple oppression becomes the language of the past and that  developing
a woman means developing a society.

In ending, allow me, Mr Chairperson, to quote the last stanza from the  work
written by Diane Ferrus:


  I have come to take you home
  where the ancient mountains shout your name.
  I have made your bed at the foot of the hill,
  your blankets are covered in buchu and mint,
  the proteas stand in yellow and white -
  I have come to take you home
  where I will sing for you
  for you have brought me peace.

Malibongwe! [Kwaqhwatywa.] [I salute you!] [Applause.]

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Sihlalo ohloniphekileyo  neNdlu  yonke,  mhlonishwa  Phini
likaNgqongqoshe  womNyango,  ukuhlonishwa  kukaSara   Baartman   kungumlando
ongeke ulibaleke emlandweni - izizukulwane ngezizukulwane.

USara wadelelwa, wajivazwa  futhi  wehliswa  isithunzi  yilabo  ababecabanga
ukuthi bayazi bebe  bengazi  lutho.  Namuhla  uyaphakanyiswa.  Kuphakanyiswa
amathambo akhe  futhi  kubuyiswa  isithunzi  sakhe.  Ubuntu  bakhe  bubuyela
enhlabathini yoyisemkhulu. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson, the House at large and  the  hon  Deputy
Minister of the department, the honouring of Sara Baartman  is  an  historic
event that can never be forgotten for generations to come.

Sara was  despised,  denigrated  and  humiliated  by  those  who  considered
themselves smart when they were so ignorant. Today  Sara  is  receiving  the
glory. Her bones are being honoured and her dignity is being  restored.  Her
humanity is being returned to the soil of her ancestors.]

Our God is  great.  He  has  brought  honour  to  his  lowly  servant,  Sara
Baartman. Her name will from now onwards  be  honoured  for  generations  to
come. She is, indeed, an epitome  of  the  restoration  of  dignity  to  all
womankind and also to the wiping away of the  degradation  to  slave  status
that she was subjected to as the ``Hottentot Venus''. This is the  vilifying
name that was used when she was a slave in Europe in the 1800s. Our  God  is
great. We glorify the Lord, the Almighty.

Egameni le-IFP, ngithi siyamdumisa uSomandla ngomsebenzi omkhulu  osuwenziwe
kusukela kulowo muntu  owenza  ucwaningo  ngoSara  kuze  kufike  esikhathini
lapho  umhlonishwa,  iPhini  likaNgqongqoshe  uBrigitte  Mabandla,  ehambela
ezweni laseFrance lapho uSara  edlula  khona  emhlabeni.  Okufike  kushaqise
kakhulu ukukhangiswa kwakhe  okwakwenziwa  ngabamhlophe  ngoba  nje  kuthiwa
wayenomzimba owawungajwayelekile.  Abesilisa  babekhokha  izimali  ukuyobuka
umuntu wesifazane enqunu. Yihlazo lamahlazo leli.

Okumangalisayo  ukuthi  noma  esedlulile  emhlabeni  ubuchopho  bakhe  kanye
nesitho sobuntu bakhe kwakhikhilizwa kwafakwa emabhodleleni  lapho  kwahlala
khona iminyaka ngeminyaka. Ngithi kubantu besifazane akuyona  indaba  encane
lena,  inkulu  iyesabeka.  USara   wahlukunyezwa   empilweni   yakhe   futhi
wayesemncane.  Akahlalanga  emhlabeni,  wafa  ehlushwa  eshiye  izwe  lakubo
nezihlobo zakhe.

Siyambonga uHulumeni ngalo lonke iqhaza alibambile ekumbuyiseni  eze  ezweni
lakubo noma esethule.  Uma  kukhona  abesifazane  abaphila  kulesi  sikhathi
samanje behlukunyezwa imihla  yonke  yokuphila  kwabo,  sithi  kubahlukumezi
mabakuyeke   lokho   futhi    mabaqaphele    ingozi.    Umuntu    uyisidalwa
sikaNkulunkulu,   noma   ngabe   udalwe   kanjani.    Ohlukumeza    isidalwa
sikaNkulunkulu uhlukumeza uNkulunkulu uqobo lwakhe. [Ihlombe.]  (Translation
of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[On behalf of the IFP I would like to say, we praise the  Almighty  for  the
great task that has been  accomplished,  from  the  time  that  that  person
started researching Sara until the time that the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister
Brigitte Mabandla visited France, where  Sara  died.  What  one  finds  most
disgusting is the fact that her body  was  displayed  by  the  white  people
simply because her physique was regarded  as  strange.  Men  used  to  spend
their money just to view the naked body of a woman. This is  a  disgrace  of
the highest order.

Even more shocking is the fact that after she died, her brains  and  private
parts were removed and stored in  bottles,  where  they  remained  for  many
years. To women, I want to say that this is not just a minor matter,  but  a
horrible affair.

Sara was abused in her life and she was still young. She did not live  long,
but died in suffering, away from her country and relatives.

We thank the Government for the role it has played in bringing her  back  to
her country, though only as a corpse. If there are women at  this  point  in
time who are victims of perpetual abuse, we appeal to their abusers to  stop
this practice and to take  heed.  A  human  being  is  a  creation  of  God,
irrespective of what he or she  looks  like,  so  anyone  who  abuses  God's
creation, abuses God himself. [Applause.]]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, hon members and hon Minister, on  21  February
2002, French research minister Roger-Gerard Schwartzenberg said:


  Saartjie Baartman was first a victim  of  the  exploitation  suffered  by
  South African ethic groups  during  colonialisation.  Secondly,  Saartjie
  Baartman was a victim of colonialism and sexism, because her dignity as a
  woman and her rights were denied. Thirdly,  she  was  also  a  victim  of
  racism, which was a characteristic  of  anthropology  at  the  time,  the
  latter being very much turned to ethnocentrism.

I see in this bill a double symbol. Firstly, it gives us the opportunity  to
turn the page of decades marked by colonialism, racism and sexism.  It  will
mark the end of a painful period  when  non-European  populations  were  not
viewed as equal to European ones. Secondly, it makes our  world  acknowledge
equality among people. This is  an  important  moment  of  unity  around  an
essential principle, the dignity of any human being,  whatever  his  or  her
religion, origin and conditions.
Sara Baartman was born in 1789 into the Griqua tribe of the Eastern Cape,  a
subgroup of the Khoisan  people,  who  are  now  thought  to  be  the  first
aboriginal inhabitants of the southern tip of Africa.

Her family moved to a shack near Cape Town, and while working as a  20-year-
old servant to a local farmer she attracted  the  attention  of  a  visiting
English ship surgeon, William Dunlop. What  made  her  a  curiosity  in  the
doctor's eyes were her extraordinarily enlarged buttocks and  her  unusually
elongated labia, a genital peculiarity of some Khoisan women of  that  time.
She agreed to go with Dunlop to England, where he  promised  her  she  would
become  rich  and  famous  as  a  subject  of  medical  and  anthropological
research.

At first  scientists,  who  named  her  genital  condition  the  ``Hottentot
apron'', placed her under anatomical scrutiny.  However,  the  only  success
she achieved was on exhibit  before  the  public,  who  queued  to  see  the
``Hottentot Venus'' as they would an animal in a zoo.
In London and later in Paris, Baartman was displayed in a  grotesque  parody
of the Birth of Venus. People paid one shilling to gawk at her in a hall  in
Piccadilly, where she was depicted as a wild animal in a cage,  dancing  for
her keeper. Baartman was supposed to be paid half of the proceeds  from  her
performances, but,  in  fact,  she  was  employed  as  a  nursemaid  by  her
impresarios and saw little  of  the  profits.  Sad  and  homesick,  she  was
persuaded to go to Paris for further  scientific  examination,  and,  again,
went on view as a freakish curiosity for a public  eager  to  see  what  was
billed as a subhuman species from Africa.

The European climate was too severe for the young servant girl from  Africa.
She fell sick and died in 1815 of what documents at the  time  described  as
``an inflammatory and eruptive sickness'', probably pneumonia.  Her  remains
were handed over to naturalists from the Musée de  l'  Homme.  They  made  a
cast of her body  and  preserved  her  brain,  genitals  and  parts  of  her
skeleton as exhibits in the museum. Even in death  the  ``Hottentot  Venus''
continued to amaze visitors, until as recently as  1975,  when  her  remains
were moved to the museum's archives.

We commend unreservedly the spirit displayed  by  some  Africans  who  never
forgot  Baartman  and  specifically  the   National   Khoisan   Consultative
Conference, a tribal representative body which has  pressed  for  Baartman's
return since 1995. Even though a change in French law was  needed  for  this
to happen, Khoisan leaders enlisted the  help  of  former  President  Nelson
Mandela  and  South  Africa's  most  renowned  palaeoanthropologist,  Philip
Tobias, to plead their case.

It is for reasons such as Sara's life that the international  community  has
specifically recognised women's and girl's rights - to be free  from  sexual
violence - in various international human rights treaties. It  is  for  this
reason that South Africans on Friday, 9 August, will be celebrating  Women's
Day.

The Beijing Declaration and Platform  for  Action,  1995,  defines  violence
against women as ``any act of gender-biased violence that results in, or  is
likely to result in physical, sexual or psychological harm or  suffering  to
women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation  of
liberty, in public or private''.

Violence against women is  one  of  the  most  brutal  consequences  of  the
economic, social, political and cultural  inequalities  that  exist  between
men and women. It is also perpetuated by legal and  political  systems  that
have historically discriminated  against  women.  The  Khoi  people  of  our
country and the descendants  of  the  Khoi  have  every  right  solemnly  to
celebrate the return of one who was their daughter.

They have every right to demand that this historic act of redress should  be
given its true meaning by the restoration to the Khoi and the San  of  their
place of pride as Africans equal to all other Africans. [Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die  Voorsitter,  baie  dankie.  In  1995  het  die
Griekwa Nasionale Konferensie die lot van Sara Baartman,  toe  nog  Saartjie
Baartman, aan oud-president Mandela bekend gemaak.

Net op daardie punt het ek 'n gevoel die  naam  Saartjie  is  júís  nou  van
toepassing, waar die verkleinwoord klem lê op liefde en nie verkleining  nie
- want ek sal vir Oom Dawie Valie tog nooit Dawid Valie kan sê nie.

Ons gee vandag erkenning aan die rol wat die pogings  van  dr  Ben  Ngubane,
prof Philip Tobias en die agb Adjunk-Minister en ander gespeel  het  om  die
terugkeer van Sara se oorskot te verseker.

Soos ons nou al gehoor het, is Sara Baartman in 1816 oorlede en  is  sy  tot
1976 tentoongestel in die Paryse Museum van die Mensheid. In Maart  2002  is
sy aan ons Regering oorhandig en sy  word  oormôre,  op  Vrydag  9  Augustus
2002, daar by  die  agb  Embrensia  Gouws  se  Hankey  begrawe.  By  hierdie
begrafnis behoort daar egter nie trane van hartseer te vloei  nie.  As  daar
trane vloei, moet dit van blydskap en feesviering wees.
Hierdie begrafnis behoort alle Suid-Afrikaners nader aan  mekaar  te  bring,
want dit is 'n simbool  van  erkenning  van  die  verlede  en  van  dit  wat
verkeerd is. Dit is egter ook 'n  simbool  en  'n  fees  van  hoop  vir  die
toekoms; hoop waar ons almal ons koppe kan hoog hou en weet  dat  menseregte
'n basiese reg is waarop  elkeen  in  Suid-Afrika  kan  aandring  omdat  ons
Grondwet dit verseker.

Terwyl papier geduldig is, is hierdie begrafnis ook  'n  simbool  dat  Suid-
Afrikaners ernstig is om die Grondwet  in  die  praktyk  'n  werklikheid  te
maak. Ons moet erken dat Sara Baartman aan onmenslikhede blootgestel was  en
daardeur beklemtoon ons die werklikheid dat die terugbring  en  begrawe  van
haar stoflike oorskot in ritme is met beskawingsnorme.

Voorsitter, daar is ongelukkig ook 'n ander sy van die saak waarna ons  moet
kyk. Ek  het  'n  skrywe  in  die  naam  van  Opperhoof  Aartsbiskop  Daniël
Kanyilles van die Nasionale Raad van die Khoi Stamhoofde ontvang.  Soos  die
agb Lubidla gesê het, hierdie mense alle reg om fees te vier,  maar  tog  is
daar hierdie boodskap:
  Die Khoisan van Suid-Afrika sit vandag met gemengde  gevoelens:  Aan  die
  een kant dankbaarheid dat Sara uiteindelik, ná die vernedering  byna  200
  jaar gelede in Europa, ter ruste gelê kan word. Sy het  dié  simbool  van
  die vernedering van vele vroue geword. Haar terugkeer  simboliseer  egter
  ook hoop dat die seksuele uitbuiting van Khoisan vroue en  vroue  in  die
  algemeen tot 'n einde sal kom.


  Daar is egter ook diepe ongelukkigheid, selfs bitterheid, binne die  breë
  Khoisan gemeenskap. Hulle  ervaar  dit  as  onaanvaarbaar  dat  dieselfde
  regering wat soveel sorg toon teenoor hul grootmoeder  Sara  Baartman  en
  haar lot beëindig het, haar volk se lot ignoreer.  Hoewel  die  Verenigde
  Nasies, waarvan die RSA 'n lidland is, al in 2000 erkenning  verleen  het
  aan die Khoisan as  Suid-Afrika  se  Eerste  Inheemse  Nasie,  sloer  die
  Regering om dieselfde te doen. Sara Baartman is wel verhef tot  nasionale
  simbool, maar sy het uit 'n spesifieke nasie gekom, naamlik die  Khoisan.
  Haar  mense  se  konstitusionele  erkenning  en  akkommodasie  is  uiters
  dringend en noodsaaklik, anders  is  die  huidige  besorgdheid  oor  haar
  waardigheid niks anders as 'n politieke speletjie nie. Dit maak geen  sin
  dat Sara as ikoon vereer word, maar haar lewende nasate word verneder  en
  misken nie.

Ek is bevoorreg dat die Opperhoof my die geleentheid gebied het  om  hierdie
saak hier te opper. Ek doen dit omdat dit alle gemeenskappe  in  Suid-Afrika
raak. Ek verwys na die waardigheid van gemeenskappe soos die  erkenning  van
die Khoisan nasie, asook die Afrikaanse gemeenskap  se  taal  wat  afgeskaal
word terwyl die erkenning, ontwikkeling en gebruik van  Zulu,  Xhosa,  Venda
en die ander inheemse tale agterweë bly. Inisiasietradisies  van  Zulus  and
Xhosas word bedreig deur gesondheidspraktyke wat aangespreek moet word -  en
nie die tradisie nie.

In  die  era  van  globalisering  word  ikone  soos  Sara  Baartman  al  hoe
belangriker  om  te  bevestig  dat  die  geestesgoedere  wat  ons  van   ons
voorvaders gekry het, in stand gehou  moet  word.  Elkeen  van  ons  en  die
Regering het 'n verantwoordelikheid hiertoe. Die  beste  manier  om  etniese
konflikte te voorkom of vreedsaam  op  te  los,  is  om  diskriminasie  teen
minderheidsgroepe en individue af te skaf. En dit is aspekte wat deeglik  in
berekening gehou is by Kempton  Park  toe  daar  sekere  klousules  vir  ons
Grondwet geformuleer is - klousules wat,  soos  aan  Sara,  waardigheid  aan
mense kan gee.

Verskillende   grondwetlike    instansies    moet    geloofwaardigheid    en
ondersteuning van die Suid-Afrikaanse publiek kry, want  hulle  moet  omsien
na ons  basiese  menseregte,  na  ons  waardigheid,  wat  Sara  ontneem  is.
Grondwetlike  instansies  soos   die   Pan-Suid-Afrikaanse   Taalraad,   die
Menseregtekommissie  en  die  beoogde  Kommissie  vir  die   Beskerming   en
Bevordering  van  Taal-,  Kultuur-  en  Godsdiensgemeenskappe  is  tot   ons
beskikking en skep 'n geleentheid om nie terug te gryp na die  verlede  nie,
maar om saam te bou vir die toekoms.

Kom ons verenig in die soeke na die gemeenskaplikhede en  bou  ons  saamwees
in hierdie wonderlike kontinent  daarop.  Ons  salueer  Sara  Baartman.  Ons
salueer die regte  van  vroue.  Ons  salueer  menseregte.  Ons  salueer  die
waardigheid van elke man, vrou en kind en verbind ons om vandag te  sien  as
'n vertrekpunt en nie 'n eindpunt nie. Die volgende gedig is van  toepassing
op Sara, maar ook op  elkeen  van  ons:  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, thank you. In 1995 the Griqua  National
Conference made the fate of Sara Baartman, then Saartjie Baartman, known  to
former president Mandela.

Regarding that point alone, I have a feeling the name Saartjie is  the  very
name that is applicable now, as the diminutive form emphasises love and  not
diminution - because I will never be able to call Uncle Dawie  Valie,  Dawid
Valie.

Today we recognise the efforts of Dr Ben Ngubane,  Prof  Philip  Tobias  and
the hon the Deputy Minister and others in  ensuring  the  return  of  Sara's
remains.

As we have heard, Sara Baartman died in 1816, and she was exhibited  in  the
Paris Museum of Humanity until 1976. In March 2002 she  was  handed  to  our
Government and she will be buried the day after tomorrow,  Friday  9  August
2002, there at the hon Embrensia Gouws's Hankey. At this  funeral,  however,
no tears of sadness should flow. If any tears are  to  flow,  they  must  be
tears of joy and celebration.

This funeral should bring all South Africans closer to one  another,  as  it
is a symbol of recognition of the past and of what is wrong. However, it  is
also a symbol and a celebration of hope for the future; hope  where  we  can
all hold our heads high and know that  human  rights  are  basic  rights  on
which every person in South Africa  can  insist,  because  our  Constitution
ensures it.

While paper is patient, this funeral is also a symbol  that  South  Africans
are serious about making the Constitution a reality  in  practice.  We  must
acknowledge that Sara Baartman was  subjected  to  inhuman  treatment,  thus
emphasising the reality that the return and burial of  her  earthly  remains
is in rhythm with civilisation's norms.

There is sadly also another side to this matter, which we have to  consider.
I received a letter  in  the  name  of  Paramount  Chief  Archbishop  Daniël
Kanyilles of the National Council of the Khoi  Tribal  Chiefs.  As  the  hon
Ludibla has said, these people  have  every  right  to  celebrate,  however,
there is this message:


  Today, the Khoisan of South Africa has mixed feelings: On  the  one  hand
  there is gratitude that Sara is eventually, after the humiliation  almost
  200 years ago in Europe, to be laid to rest. She became the  very  symbol
  of the humiliation of many women. However,  her  return  also  symbolises
  hope that the sexual exploitation of Khoisan women and women  in  general
  will come to an end.


  However, there is deep  unhappiness,  even  bitterness,  in  the  broader
  Khoisan community. They experience  it  as  unacceptable  that  the  same
  Government that is showing  so  much  care  for  their  grandmother  Sara
  Baartman and has ended her fate, ignores her nation's fate.  Even  though
  the United Nations, of which the RSA is a member, have  already  in  2000
  given recognition to the  Khoisan  as  South  Africa's  First  Indigenous
  Nation, the Government has dragged their feet in doing the same. Although
  Sara Baartman has been elevated to  national  symbol,  she  came  from  a
  specific  nation,  namely  the  Khoisan.  Her   people's   constitutional
  recognition  and  accommodation  is  extremely  urgent   and   essential,
  otherwise the current concern about her dignity is nothing other  than  a
  political game. It does not make sense that Sara is honoured as an  icon,
  but her living descendants are humiliated and disregarded.

I am privileged that the Paramount Chief gave me the  opportunity  to  raise
this issue here. I am doing it because it concerns all communities in  South
Africa. I am making  reference  to  the  dignity  of  communities  like  the
acknowledgement of  the  Khoisan  nation,  also  the  Afrikaans  community's
language, which is being down-scaled,  while  the  recognition,  development
and use of Zulu, Xhosa, Venda and the other indigenous  languages  are  left
behind. Initiation traditions of Zulus and Xhosas are threatened  by  health
issues which must be addressed - and not the tradition.

In the era of globalisation, icons like Sara Baartman become  all  the  more
important when confirming that the spiritual wealth which we inherited  from
our forebears must be maintained. Each of us,  and  the  Government,  has  a
responsibility in this respect. The best way to avoid ethnic conflict or  to
solve it peacefully is to abolish  discrimination  against  minority  groups
and  individuals.  These  are  aspects  which  were  thoroughly  taken  into
consideration at Kempton Park when certain clauses of our Constitution  were
formulated - clauses which can give people, like Sara, dignity.

Different constitutional institutions must receive credibility  and  support
from the South African public, because they must look after our basic  human
rights,  our  dignity,  of   which   Sara   was   deprived.   Constitutional
institutions like the Pan South African Language  Board,  the  Human  Rights
Commission and the envisaged Commission for the Protection and Promotion  of
Linguistic, Cultural, and Religious Communities  are  at  our  disposal  and
present an opportunity not to revert to the past, but to build together  for
the future.

Let us unite in the pursuit of commonalities and build our  togetherness  in
this wonderful continent on that. We salute Sara  Baartman.  We  salute  the
rights of women. We salute human rights. We salute the dignity of each  man,
woman and child and commit ourselves to seeing today as  a  starting  point,
and not as a destination. The following poem  is  applicable  to  Sara,  but
also to each of us:]

  'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer
  Thought it scarcely worth his while
  To waste much time on the old violin,
  But held it up with a smile.
  ``What am I bidden, good folks,'' he cried,
  ``Who'll start the bidding for me?''
  ``A dollar, a dollar,'' then, two! Only two?
  ``Two dollars, and who'll make it three?
  ``Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;
  Going for three ... '' But no,
  From the room, far back, a grey-haired man
  Came forward and picked up the bow;
  Then, wiping the dust from the old violin,
  And tightening the loose strings,
  He played a melody pure and sweet
  As a carolling angel sings.


  The music ceased, and the auctioneer,
  With a voice that was quiet and low,
  Said: ``What am I bid for the old violin?''
  And he held it up with the bow.
  ``A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?
  Two thousand! And who'll make it three?
  Three thousand, once; three thousand, twice;
  And going and gone,'' said he.


  The people cheered, but some of them cried,
  ``We do not quite understand
  What changed its worth?'' Swift came the reply:
  ``The touch of a master's hand.''


  And many a man with life out of tune,
  And battered and scarred with sin,
  Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,
  Much like the old violin.
  A ``mess of potage'', a glass of wine;
  A game - and he travels on.
  He is ``going'' once, and ``going'' twice,
  He's ``going; and almost ``gone''.
  But the Master comes and the foolish crowd
  Never can quite understand
  The worth of a soul and the charge that's wrought
  By the touch of the Master's hand.

[Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, perhaps first  and  foremost  one  has  to  say
sorry to Sara Baartman for her experience and, of course, to the  family  of
Sara Baartman. An adage has it that a man who is born of  woman  is  of  few
days and full of troubles. Others argue that every man  is  born  free,  but
wherever he goes, he is in chains.

Sara Baartman's life history has been no exception from these  observations.
However, one needs to exercise due care not to lift  Sara  Baartman's  story
above other known similar cases of sexual harassment and human torture  that
we have experienced and are still experiencing in South Africa.

While we engage ourselves in this discussion, we need to bear in  mind  that
often our attempts to say something wise and helpful, as we are  doing  here
at the moment, are far less valuable than just sitting next to the  bereaved
ones, holding their hands and crying with them.  Jesus  Christ  demonstrated
this principle when he visited  Mary  and  Martha  after  Lazarus  died.  He
sensed the depth of Mary's despair over her brother Lazarus's death  and  he
shared her grief by weeping.

Sara Baartman's body will be buried on Friday in the Eastern  Cape.  Perhaps
that will be our chance to avail ourselves there, next to her body  and  her
next of kin.

Perpetrators of crimes of high degree, such  as  rape,  incest,  bestiality,
sodomy and murder should not, when found guilty by a  court  of  law,  enjoy
mercy of whatever nature, in any  way  but  rather  be  unconditionally  and
permanently removed from our society.

May I commend our Government and the  people  of  South  Africa  for  having
expressed ubuntu, in classic terms, by accepting the disgraced body  of  our
sister, Sara Baartman, given back  by  the  great  nations  of  Europe  that
claimed to be better civilised than dark Africa.

These are the few words I wanted to share with  the  House  on  this  issue.
[Applause.]

Ms  J  L  KGOALI:  Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister,  colleagues,  ladies  and
gentlemen, there is an old proverb that says it takes a village to  raise  a
child. I would add that it takes dignity in the village to  put  dignity  in
the child.

But, as mothers, daughters and sisters, our challenge today goes beyond  the
boundaries of any one village. It is to build a village of dignity  for  all
women and children across the nation and around the  world.  To  build  this
village, we must continue the work that began nearly 50 years ago  by  women
such as Lillian Ngoyi, Ida Mntwana,  Charlotte  Maxeke,  Ruth  First,  Helen
Joseph, Dorothy Nyembe, Ma-Baard and many others who  stood  very  firm  and
defied the then oppressive laws in our country. Their struggle  against  the
blatant attempt by the apartheid regime to strip them of their dignity  laid
the early foundation for us to build a village of dignity.

Today, 7 August 2002, two days prior to National Women's Day, I am proud  to
stand here in memory of these heroic women. I proudly stand here  to  salute
our Government for providing us with the building  blocks  in  the  form  of
gender-sensitive legislation and policy changes to  construct  this  village
of dignity on the solid foundation that has been laid by these brave women.

August 9 represents the collective effort of women in  this  country  nearly
50 years ago to take a stand and say to the racist  white  minority:  ``thus
far, and no further.'' August 9, 1956, was the day on  which  women  marched
to the Union Buildings to hand in a petition opposing the extension of  pass
laws to black people specifically, but more generally to say  oppression  of
one by another is wrong. It is a day that has come to represent  the  spirit
of women in this  country,  both  black  and  white,  to  fight  for  gender
equality, and has since been declared National Women's Day.  It  is  a  very
important day to us. It is also an International Day of  Indigenous  People,
a reference more to countries  where  aboriginal  inhabitants  such  as  the
first nations of the Americas and New Zealand, as  well  as  Australia,  are
still being subjugated by the colonisers-turned-masters.

It was on 9 August two years ago that the monument  to  the  women  of  this
country was unveiled in Tshwane. The monument  represents  the  campaign  to
claim women's place in society, their humanity  and  their  rights.  African
women in particular, and Africans generally, have a  huge  task  to  reclaim
their heritage. It is this drive to reclaim the heritage of who we  are  and
who we must become that saw the Deputy Minister of  Arts,  Culture,  Science
and Technology, Comrade Bridgette Mabandla, mounting a campaign  to  reclaim
the remains of the most abused African woman,  our  great-great-grandmother,
Sara Baartman.

That campaign saw history  being  made  four  months  ago  when  the  French
government and its parliament  passed  laws  for  her  remains,  defined  in
French laws as artefacts, to be repatriated, returned back home.

What we need to celebrate  here  today  is  the  wandering  spirit  of  Sara
Baartman, our grandmother, who will be laid to rest on 9 August  2002  on  a
hilltop overlooking the Gamtoos River near where she was born.

The struggle to have her remains returned to the land  of  her  birth  is  a
critical part of the struggle for the restoration of the  human  dignity  of
women all over the world who have been subjected  to  colonial,  racist  and
sexist oppression. It is an affirmation of  women's  determination  to  take
back what rightfully belongs to them: dignity as women.

The ANC supports the Government's vision which recognises the full  humanity
of women. It is a vision of restoring the human dignity of women,  a  vision
that affords women a choice in how they live  their  lives,  a  vision  that
gives them equal access to essential services, and a vision that gives  them
an equal opportunity to contribute to public life.

The ANC salutes the Government of the day for its efforts in  ensuring  that
human dignity is being respected. Today  we  say,  ``never  shall  women  be
abused or harassed''. Let us all strive to defend the rights of women.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Malibongwe!
Chairperson,  let  me  really  thank   hon   members   for   the   inspiring
contributions and the true affirmation of our commitment as a people to  the
advancement of human rights.

I would like  perhaps,  to  correct  something  mentioned  here  by  Mr  Van
Niekerk, because I think what was passed on to him was not correct.  Let  me
begin by saying that one of the  legacies  of  apartheid  is  the  issue  of
identity, in that many in our country still have doubts about who  they  are
and where they belong. It is a legacy of apartheid, and it is  one  that  we
will be able to deal with as our  democracy  and  our  constitutional  state
strengthens, because we are now a people governed by new values.

When, indeed, we chose  a  human  rights  framework,  it  was  precisely  in
recognition of our diversity and the fact that there are challenges that  we
will face as a people. So, we ought to say no to ethnic chauvinism, and  yes
to nation-building.

In fact, in all our consultations with people who have first claim,  or  see
themselves as having first claim, to the legacy of Sara Baartman,  there  is
an understanding that what we are doing is  in  the  interests  of  all  our
people in South Africa.

In fact, as the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, we  are
celebrating our common heritage, which was ignored in the past,  by  putting
forward new interpretations of, for instance, Isandlwana and the  Anglo-Boer
War - the South  African  War  -  but,  today,  as  we  are  returning  Sara
Baartman, this is common heritage. It provides us with moments when  we  say
no to war, no to intolerance of differences on the basis of religion,  race,
ethnicity, culture, etc.

I worry about what the hon member has just said in  that  there  are  people
who ... I mean, the question is neither here nor there. As a  constitutional
state, whether there are first people or second people,  we  are  all  South
Africans. South Africa belongs to all its people, black and white.

We have a Constitution that makes us equal to each other,  individually  and
as groups. We are allowed by our Constitution to make  associations  of  our
choice. We have a Human Rights Commission which is there as a  watchdog  for
gross human rights violations by either vertical or  horizontal  action.  We
also have a Public Protector for where  there  is  discrimination  by  state
organs. So,  it  is  incorrect  for  people  to  say  that  this  Government
discriminates against a certain group of  people  called  the  Khoisan.  Our
coat of arms, which is one  of  the  first-order  national  symbols  of  our
country,  recognises  in  its  motifs  and  wording  one  of  the  important
languages that we nearly lost.

I would like to assure my colleagues that we did not ride on the just  event
of the return of Sara Baartman. I indeed will formally  inform  hon  members
today that in 1995 one of the tasks with a human  rights  background  -  and
the first thing that I wanted to know  -  was  whether  there  were  Khoisan
people in this country and where they were. It was  on  the  basis  of  that
information and interaction that in 1996  a  resolution  was  taken  at  the
CSIR, at a summit we had convened, to say that we wanted  Sara  Baartman  to
be returned to us.

It is  because  of  the  work  we  did  that  when  we  were  given  poverty
alleviation allocations, we dedicated R6 million to  our  San  and  Khoi  or
Khoisan communities, because there is still debate  about  who  people  are.
And,  as  I  say,  after  Sara,  one  of  the  positive  spin-offs  will  be
scholarships. We will, indeed, sponsor  academic  work  around  the  Khoisan
heritage in full. So we will confirm who  people  are  for  the  purpose  of
heritage. [Applause.]

I would like to say to my dear sisters  and  brothers  that  when  Charlotte
Maxeke spoke she said the challenges then were poverty, disease and lack  of
education. And these are the things that we  face  today.  Let  us  use  the
memory of Sara to reaffirm and strengthen our communities.  It  is  still  a
challenge today. And, because we will be  working  together  and  networking
among ourselves across the colour line, we will be able  to  deal  with  the
real nitty-gritties, the real issues of our people.

Having said that, we should say no to any  form  of  discrimination  against
people and actually blow the whistle if there are  institutions  or  persons
that ill-treat other people because they are  of  Khoisan  origin.  We  must
actually correct that misrepresentation because it is  not  true;  it  is  a
lie. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! That  concludes
the discussion. Allow me to take this opportunity to thank  the  hon  Deputy
Minister for engaging this House in a lively debate and for exchanging  such
valuable information with us.

Debate concluded.

                          PLANNING PROFESSION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson and hon members present in  this  House,  we  are
presenting the Planning Profession Bill.

Although town and  regional  planning  may  be  a  profession  with  a  long
tradition of social service in other countries,  concerns  over  the  rights
and needs of disadvantaged and marginalised sectors of the  population,  the
equitable distribution of resources  and  the  involvement  of  citizens  in
community decisions have been absent from this profession in South Africa.

The professional planner is one of the key contributors to making urban  and
rural life workable, liable and prosperous.  A  planner  provides  research,
reasoned analysis and recommendation to both  the  public  and  the  private
sector, intended to meet the needs of all sectors of society.

The rapid pace of social transformation in South  Africa,  particularly  the
Government's integrated urban renewal and rural development programmes,  has
meant that the planning profession will increasingly be called upon to  deal
with development issues such as conversion of land from natural  habitat  to
urban built areas, maintenance and use of natural  resources  and  habitats,
development  of  transportation-related  infrastructure  and   environmental
protection.

In South Africa, the planning discipline has been widely perceived  to  have
been an  instrument  to  implement  the  ideology  of  apartheid.  With  the
democratic  transformation  of  the  country,  it  is  necessary  that  this
profession undergoes a similar change, if it is to have  any  relevance  now
and in the future.

This requires the formulation  and  acceptance  of  an  appropriate  ethical
code, with the express aim of serving and furthering the  interests  of  the
underprivileged and previously disadvantaged communities.  Planning  actions
should thus be geared towards empowering the members  of  these  communities
so that they can contribute to the advancement of the nation.

One of the critical shortcomings in the  profession  has  been  the  way  in
which professional knowledge was guarded  and  disseminated.  The  education
and  training  of  persons  as  planners  remain  firmly  located   in   the
traditionally historically white institutions at the  expense  of  the  vast
majority of South Africans.
Since  effective  democracy  relies  on  informed   constituencies,   expert
knowledge and institutions  related  to  the  planning  profession  must  be
demystified  to  facilitate  greater   democratic   participation   by   the
previously marginalised and disadvantaged majority.

The  Bill,  therefore,  seeks  to  broaden  access  to  this  profession  to
previously disadvantaged South Africans. It envisages the  establishment  of
a  representative  council  of  planners,  which  will  have  the  task   of
transforming the profession so that it can promote the role of  planning  in
line with our Government's social, economic and political objectives.

We, therefore, support this Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  That  was  the  only
statement, and it  concludes  the  speakers'  list.  I  shall  now  put  the
question,  and  the  question  is  that  the  Bill,  subject   to   proposed
amendments, be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 63, I  shall  first  allow
political parties the opportunity to make declarations of vote, if  they  so
wish. Any political party? Yes, the New NP, I see Dr Conroy.

Declaration of Vote:

Dr E A CONROY: The Planning Profession Bill  aims  to  establish  mechanisms
for quality control by means of mandatory registration  of  all  persons  in
the planning profession and by work reservation. It also  seeks  to  broaden
the access to the profession and tighten the ethical  standards  with  which
planners will have to comply.

Therefore, the New NP supports the Bill, which establishes juristic  persons
to be known as a South African Council for Planners, whose  function  is  to
administer the profession.

Bill, subject to a proposed amendment, agreed to in accordance with  section
75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 15:27
