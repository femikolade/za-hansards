       costs for having sexually harassed a former lecturer at the
       university, Dr Margaret Orr;


  (2) notes that whatever he did was a personal matter; and


  (3) acknowledges that -


       (a)  public funds should not be committed to this despicable conduct,
           as it would be supporting him against her; and


       (b)  at best he should be relieved of the responsibility of being
           chairman of such a world-acclaimed centre of learning.

           farmworkers may legally be on their land;


       (b)  the disastrous directive by Zanu-PF will displace 1,5 million

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the contents of the report of the Myburgh commission in respect
       of the severe devaluation of the rand earlier this year;


  (2) further notes that the IFP at the time of the appointment of the
       commission indicated that this investigation would be a costly
       exercise, which would do no more than give the Government a greater
       understanding of market forces and exchange rate fluctuations; and


  (3) therefore urges Government Ministers and spokespersons to give
       careful consideration to statements issued by them in order that such
       statements do not impact negatively on the market place and lead to
       the volatility in the value of the rand, so clearly demonstrated by
       the recent Government fiasco regarding mining rights and the future
       ownership and shareholding of mines.

           swimmers in the 800 metres in the Commonwealth Games on Friday,
           2 August, in Manchester, in the process earning two gold medals;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  her achievements serve as an honour to all South Africans and
           women in particular; and


       (b)  this achievement further demonstrates the strength and
           resilience of women who, throughout our history, have been in
           the forefront of our social transformation processes, aimed at
           realising a truly free, nonsexist, nonracial, democratic South
           Africa; and


  (3) notes that -


       (a)  the ANC and the people of South Africa congratulate Natalie du

  (1) notes with concern the appalling working conditions that some factory

       so careless about their workers' general well-being;

           this week;


  (2) expresses its utter frustration at the unacceptable schooling
       conditions in which students had to ask neighbouring communities to
       use basic services such as toilets and water; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of Education to ensure that such deplorable
       education conditions do not repeat themselves and to guarantee the
       creation of a suitable learning environment for all our children.

                   WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Madam Speaker and hon
members, Southern Africa is the cradle of humankind. About 120 000 years
ago, human beings began the journey from here to occupy the other
continents and the furthest corners of planet earth. For most of this
period, our ancestors lived in harmony with nature. Over the millennia,
human beings advanced socially, economically and culturally, never once
facing self-destruction.

All that changed in the last 100 years. Human beings, for the first time,
started destroying the very earth which we need for our survival. Much of
the world's fish stocks have been depleted. Large quantities of carbon
dioxide pumped into the atmosphere by industrial and motor vehicles has led
to global warming. Many plant and animal species are becoming extinct.
Rivers and underground water resources are being polluted, and forests are
being destroyed. The last century can be characterised as the era of
unsustainable development.

Our world is on a development path that is unsustainable. If we all consume
as much as the average US citizen does, this world will implode. But the
patterns of consumption are not just unsustainable, they are also unfair.
The entire continent of Africa is responsible for a mere 3% of carbon
emissions into the atmosphere, yet pays the same high price for climate
change as the rest of the world. So, poor Africans are subsidising rich
Americans, Europeans and Japanese.

The first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held in
1972 in Stockholm. Speaking in Rio de Janeiro in June this year, President
Mbeki said, and I quote:


  Today, thirty years later, we have fewer fish in the sea, more carbon
  dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere, more desertification, more soil
  erosion, and more species extinction.


  Our very development model is questioned daily by the earth's ecosystem,
  on which all life and all economic activity is dependent. Our patterns of
  consumption and production cannot be left unchecked. If the Chinese
  citizen is to consume the same quantity of crude oil as his or her US
  counterpart, China would need over 80 million barrels of oil a day -
  slightly more than the 74 million barrels a day the entire world now
  produces. If annual paper use in China of 35kg per person were to climb
  to the US level of 342kg, China would need more paper than the world
  currently produces.

The period since the Rio Earth Summit was one of unprecedented global
economic growth. Growth in the world economy in the year 2000 alone
exceeded that during the entire 19th century. Yet people continue to die of
hunger; babies are born, grow up and die without being able to read or
write; many fellow humans do not have clean water to drink; and people die
of curable diseases. The gulf between the rich and poor members of the
human race widens as we speak.

The Johannesburg World Summit must take further our pledge at the
Millennium Summit to eradicate poverty. It must focus on implementation and
action. Its outcome must make sense to she who has to walk for kilometres
to fetch drinking water and to she who spends hours gathering firewood for
energy. It must also speak to he who consumes more than the earth can give.


The quest for sustainable development cannot and should not be separated
from the struggle for the emancipation of women. The burden of women in
developing countries is compounded by poverty, malnutrition, lack of access
to fresh water, inadequate sanitation and desertification. The dominance of
men in global decision-making must change. Something is wrong when, even in
the year 2002, the entire world only has 22 woman environment Ministers.

The Johannesburg World Summit is now only two weeks away. We are nearing
the end of a long preparatory period spanning the past two years. At the
beginning of the process, it was not possible to say with any degree of
certainty what the scale, agenda or outcomes of the summit would be. But
now, on the eve of the event, the stage is set and the agenda is clear. As
the world begins to gather in Johannesburg over the next few weeks, they
will build on the far-reaching consensus that was generated during an
extremely rich and comprehensive global preparatory process.
What are the main areas of agreement? Firstly, there is consensus that the
central focus of the summit should be on the eradication of poverty.
Secondly, there is consensus that the summit must be primarily about
implementation and delivery. Thirdly, it is agreed that there should be a
balanced emphasis on all three pillars of sustainable development: social
development, economic development and the protection of the environment.
Fourthly, it is agreed that the main areas of action should be access to
water and sanitation; access to energy, health care, food security, and
biodiversity and ecosystem management. Fifthly, there is consensus that
implementation must involve partnerships between governments of the North
and the South, and between governments and the private sector and civil
society. Sixthly, there is agreement that Africa must enjoy priority in the
action plans, with Nepad serving as the delivery vehicle. Seventhly, there
is consensus that that summit must endorse and rededicate itself to the
decisions of the Rio Earth Summit, including agenda 21.

There are outstanding areas on which agreements have not been reached.
These include the application of the principle of common but differentiated
responsibility among countries for sustainable development; the setting of
targets for the provision of adequate sanitation and the setting of targets
for renewable forms of energy; the phasing-out of environmentally harmful
and trade-distorting subsidies; the mobilisation of already committed funds
and the need for new and additional resources, and the link between
sustainable development and good governance.

In order to explore solutions to the outstanding issues, President Mbeki
and Secretary-General Kofi Annan decided to convene a meeting of a select
but representative group of countries referred to as `the friends of the
chair'. These countries include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark,
Egypt, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Italy, Jamaica, Japan,
Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, the Russian federation, Senegal, Sweden,
Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Venezuela.

The meeting was held on 17 July in New York. At the meeting it became clear
that while tough negotiations will take place at the summit, there is a
genuine commitment on the part of most countries to a constructive search
for solutions. As a result of these consultations, South Africa accepted a
proposal made by, among others, the G77 group that negotiations should
begin two days before the actual start of the summit. So, these informal
negotiations will now take place on 24 and 25 August.

We are confident that all outstanding matters can be resolved. All
indications are that the summit will be attended by a large number of heads
of state and government. This, together with the presence in Johannesburg
of global leaders of all sectors of society, promises to make this event
one of deep significance to humanity.

The official United Nations Summit will, in addition to governments,
provide for the active participation of representatives of, amongst others,
youth, women, trade unions and business organisations. Representatives of
these groups will also have the opportunity to interact directly with heads
of state and government in a series of relatively intimate round-table
meetings.

In addition to the events at the Sandton Convention Centre, hundreds of
parallel events will take place elsewhere in Johannesburg and other South
African cities. The Civil Society Global Forum involving tens of thousands
of delegates will take place at the Nasrec Expo Centre from 23 August to 4
September.

A number of civil society pre-summit conferences will take place from 19
August to 23 August. Among these, the International Youth Summit will be
held at Sun City in the North West, and the Indigenous People's
International Summit will be held in Kimberley. The International Local
Government Conference will be held at the Sandton Crowne Plaza Hotel.
Judges and chief justices from around the world-will meet at the Global
Judges Symposium from 18 to 20 August. Private-sector leaders will attend
the Business Forum Lekgotla at the Hilton Hotel.

The Interparliamentary Union will be holding a two-day event entitled
``Sustainable Development: The role of parliaments in ensuring
implementation and accountability'' on 29 and 30 August at the Sandton
Convention Centre. Over the same two days, the Parliamentarians Workshop on
Clean Air and Clean Water, organised by Parliamentarians for Global Action,
will be held at the Summer Palace Hotel.

In order to provide for the worldwide request to exhibit sustainable
development best practice projects, a tented city, called Ubuntu Village,
has been constructed. At the centre of Ubuntu Village is the 11 000 square
metre Tensile One, the world's biggest tent. Ubuntu Village will be a hive
of activity, with exhibitions, talks, conferences, launches and cultural
events. Among the exhibitions will be an extensive display of renewable and
clean energy technology. The village will also be open to the public.

The Randburg Dome will be transformed into the Water Dome by the Global
Water and Sanitation Sector. This will be the gathering place for
governments and nongovernmental organisations involved in water and
sanitation. The Water Dome will house exhibitions, talks, meetings and
conferences on the subject.

South Africa's vibrant culture will also play a role in enriching the
event. Johannesburg's Newtown precinct will be the epicentre of a large
number of theatrical, musical and other cultural performances.

The Global Forum opening ceremony will be held on 23 August at the
Johannesburg Stadium. The South African Government official welcome
ceremony will be held on 25 August at Ubuntu Village. On the day before the
heads of state and heads of government segment of the WSSD takes place,
President Mbeki and Secretary-General Kofi Annan will visit the cradle of
humankind in order to pay homage to our origins.

Both the Gauteng province and the Johannesburg metro are leaving no stone
unturned to make the event a success. The province is engaged in the
``greening of the summit'' project. The aim is to establish an
international benchmark in the minimisation of waste and the minimisation
of the environmental impact of huge events. Ninety per cent of the waste
generated by the summit will be recycled, and an innovative scheme would
compensate for the emissions of carbon resulting from energy used in summit
activities. The Johannesburg metro has spruced up the city to give a warm
African welcome to our visitors.
In response to a call for volunteers, the citizens of Johannesburg
responded in a spirit of Vukuzenzele. Five thousand volunteers have been
recruited to perform a range of tasks. I would like to extend my thanks to
these patriots.

All South Africans should share in the pride of acting as hosts to the
world's presidents, prime ministers, kings and queens, judges,
representatives of workers and business; youth and women; religious
leaders, and representatives of communities from all corners of the earth.
This will be a massive gathering of representatives of humanity under the
slogan ``People, planet, prosperity''.

Humanity returns to Africa, our common birthplace, to open a new chapter in
human solidarity. All will be united in the pursuit of one single
overriding imperative: the adequate provision for the needs of the present
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their needs. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, we will be returning to the issues raised by the
Minister and others that are linked to the World Summit when this House
debates the summit and the issues next Thursday. As hon members are aware,
we will also be participating in the meetings at the World Summit organised
by us and the Interparliamentary Union. As we are having a debate, there
will be no statements from parties on the Minister's statement.

Before we proceed to the subject for discussion, I would, firstly, like to
greet hon members as tomorrow is Women's Day. I want to greet the men and
the women, and urge them to focus on a certain number of issues that will
be raised, I hope, not a moment too soon.

I particularly want to welcome the large number of women whom I see in the
public gallery. [Applause.] I want to greet all of them and, of course, on
behalf of this House, all women in South Africa. I also want to draw
attention to the fact that we are celebrating our achievements as a
society, particularly those of the women. But we should also be focusing on
what we still need to do to create the nonsexist society that is reflected
in our Constitution. So we need to be focusing on both.

Part of achieving that is for women in the country to engage much more with
Parliament, in the public gallery, on the floor of this House and, of
course, in our committees. I hope we will see many more women engaging with
Parliament, and many more men speaking on issues of how to create a
nonsexist society. [Applause.]

I wait to see in the forthcoming debate how many of those cheers are
translated into actual speeches. [Interjections.] I now look forward to the
Chief Whips promptly changing their speakers' lists.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Malibongwe! [Praise] Madam Speaker, hon members of
the House, the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, the hon
Dr Ben Ngubane, and the Deputy Minister, the hon Brigitte Mabandla
requested me to pass on a message of thanks and gratitude to all members of
the House, to the dignitaries and the South African citizenry for gracing
the symbolic occasion of the enrobement of Sarah Baartman which took place
on Sunday, 4 August, at the Civic Centre here in Cape Town.

A woman named Sarah Baartman was taken away from her home country, South
Africa, to London in 1810. The African continent at the time was not
regarded by Europe as a place of historical entity. Its people, religion,
tradition and culture only made sense when interpreted through the eyes and
consciousness of Europe. Africa was regarded as a continent divided by
civilisation, which could be described as white Africa and black Africa.
That was a time when Africa was vulnerable. Colonialism took advantage of
this unfortunate circumstance and moved in to rob Africa of its dignity.

Sarah became one of those who suffered under colonial prejudice, who became
the victims of racism which embodied the superiority of a people whose
culture and norms operated on the basis that what they could not understand
or comprehend had to be inferior since they regarded themselves as the
better race. What they believed in had to be better than anyone else's, and
that was colonialism at play.

The sole purpose of Sarah's abductors was to exhibit her in the Piccadilly
Circus as an item of interest, basically viewed as a creature to be paraded
to the European audiences for jest and entertainment. Her captors saw in
her a commodity they could use for making profit from the circus. Rational
analysis makes us doubt if the exact intention of her being taken to Europe
was explained when she was led out of her country of birth. All we are told
is that she was promised a share of the profits which would be generated
through the ``wonder'' that she was. How sad! A so-called civilised class
debased itself to levels of disgrace and disregard for human dignity and
respect - abuse at the highest level.

The story of Sarah Baartman reveals the saddest part of our history as a
country and the humiliation that was meted out by colonial forces to the
people of Africa. From the top of the continent to south of the Sahara,
colonialism ravaged the culture of the peoples of this continent. It
accelerated the erosion of the unity of the groups and communities on this
continent.

When one reads the balance sheet in the political-cultural field one sees
that by the 1800s colonialism found itself strong enough to intensify and
accelerate the state of instability, characterised by violence, wars and
disorder emerging from the insecurity of the Mfecane conflicts; the Fulbe
jihads; the rise of the Tukulor and Mande empires in the western Sudan; the
disintegration of the Oyo and the Asante empires in West Africa. This
situation is comparable to the Napoleonic wars, the intellectual
revolutions and the German and Italian wars of unification. The problems in
Africa were not peculiar to the continent, but were a reflection of the
disagreements and expansions of kingdoms.

South of the Sahara we found the San and the Khoi being driven out of their
lands and exterminated or assimilated into colonial society. Sarah
Baartman, a woman of Khoi origin, was identified as a subject of scorn and
humiliation. She was exported to Europe, a continent far away from her
homeland, divided from her continent by the sea. How could she, even if she
longed for home, be able to swim back to the shores of the Cape over the
seas? How would she run away, back to her home of warm summers and green
fields? She was encaged, enslaved and marketed in the circus as a strange
creation of nature.

Sarah must have felt lost, desolate and lonely. Those who tried to fight
for her freedom in the British courts - the abolitionists - were told that
Sarah signed a contract willingly, implying that she signed up for
humiliation, degradation, scorn, prejudice, exclusion, racism and sexism.
Did Sarah really willingly agree to be paraded naked along a stage two feet
high to be exhibited like a wild beast, forced to walk, stand or sit as
ordered? We have heard the following before, haven't we? ``The slaves are
happy with the treatment the masters and madams give them. These people
would rather be here than anywhere else.'' So said the masters trying to
justify their acts.

Sarah is one of us. She is back home. She is here to receive the burial
that human beings are accorded by their families, communities and
countries. Sarah is back to remind humanity that human rights, respect and
dignity befit all persons, no matter who they are, where they come from and
what they are called and named because they belong to someone. They belong
to a community, to a family. They have relatives who love them.

We love Sarah for who she was, one of us shipped off, in a diaspora to
confirm the prejudices of colonial masters, to satisfy the curiosity of a
French scientist, who could not resist cutting up her body when she died
and dissecting it to conduct experiments and as a way of investigating
whether she was real enough to be classified as human, or whether she
actually belonged to the circus as part of the animal kingdom tamed to
entertain circus-goers.

Sarah's brain and other soft tissues were preserved. Her skeletal remains
were put on a museum display until the 1970s. Sarah Baartman's debasement
in both life and death came to reflect, in a very confirmed practical
manner, the voracity of an unfounded racial superiority complex.

We are here today to initiate, through this debate, the reburial of one of
us, the interment of Sarah Baartman, and not the ``Hottentot Venus'', as
she was derogatorily dubbed.

A French print entitled La Belle Hottentot depicts Sarah, the African
miracle, as a woman standing on a box pedestal with her buttocks exposed.
Several figures bend, straining for a better look, while a male figure at
the right of the image even holds his eyeglass up to better behold the
woman's body. Some remarks were made, including, ``Oh! Goddamn, what roast
beef'' and ``Ah! How comical is nature.''

We are here not to mourn Sarah's death, but to celebrate the strength of
our people who made sure that she is not forgotten, who made sure that we
negotiated with the French government to repatriate her remains. This is
the triumph of our people, the belief in human rights and respect for the
entire humanity. We have risen as a country and as a people from the ashes
of oppression, from the scourge of apartheid and colonialism, firmly
convinced that safeguarding human rights and women's rights is a struggle
we must all continue to wage to ensure that human beings are treated
equally and with dignity. This is the affirmation of our Constitution, of
our history, of a people determined and prepared to uphold the principles
of human rights.

To achieve genuine equality in our country, our programmes must be based on
a real understanding of what gender oppression can do to a nation. Sarah's
history of persecution and humiliation is but an illustration of what
happens to those who are discriminated against on the basis of colour, sex
or geographic exclusion. We are one nation that cannot afford to accept any
form of discrimination after what we have gone through as a collective.

Oppression is rooted in a material base, it is expressed in sociocultural
attitudes, all of which are supported and perpetuated by an ideology which
subordinates women. The history of oppression in our country has clearly
demonstrated the fact that women became the instrument through which the
strength and the resilience of our people was tested. They were thrown onto
the lowest ladder of economic structures, turned into breeders of labour
for the mines and farms, and forced to do the dirty and humiliating work
churned out for the institutionalised systems that relegated them to the
level of subhumans.

Women in this country, particularly African women, were subjugated,
deprived and marginalised in many different ways. They were regarded as
junior and inferior to the male species. They make up the majority of the
unemployed, the disempowered. They were not in decision-making structures,
but our democratic approach to human beings today is to change such
patterns of discriminatory practice.

Sarah Baartman will be laid to rest at her place of birth tomorrow, 9
August, in the Gamtoos River Valley. The women and men of this country
salute Sarah Baartman, who faced and fought the worst form of racism all by
herself, without the immediate collective effort that has seen our country
freed from apartheid colonialism. Sarah's burial will be a response to the
late Comrade President O R who said in 1985, and I quote:


  We do not consider our objectives achieved, our tasks completed or our
  struggle at an end until the women are fully liberated.

Sarah Baartman is finally free from humiliation and scorn. This gives us
hope that the struggle for the liberation of this nation, from a painful
past of 300 years of oppression and repression, hunger and exclusion, will
gradually redress the evils of the past.

We stand here today to thank all those who made sure that we got the
opportunity to bury Sarah Baartman in honour. They are the ambassadors of
South Africa to France, the former ambassador, Ms Barbara Masekela; the
current ambassador, Mrs Thuthukile Skweyiya; the French government; members
of the French National Assembly for the unanimous vote that upheld the
principles of human rights, the vote for her repatriation to her people;
and the reference group of 12 members - Y Abrahams, Prof H Bredekamp, Chief
J Burgess, Ms D Ferrus, hon member of Parliament Mrs Bertha Gxowa, Mr J
Kollapen, hon member of Parliament Mrs Makho Njobe, Dr Adelaide Tambo, Prof
P V Tobias, Prof H Soodyall and Ms S Williams.

Sarah Baartman's dignity has been reclaimed. Through her reburial, we may
begin to say the images of women in Africa will reflect those of people who
are respected, and the many facets of inequality brought about by colonial
influences may finally be dealt a final blow. Sarah belongs to the women of
Africa. Although Sarah came from the womb of the Khoi people, she belongs
to all of us. She belongs to Africa. She belongs to humanity.

Malibongwe igama la makhosikazi! [Kwaqhwatywa.] [Praise the name of women!
[Applause.]]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker, I would also like to join you in greeting
all the women on the gallery, and extend a warm word of welcome to all of
them.

Suid-Afrika is voorwaar een nasie met vele volkere, 11 amptelike tale, vele
kulture en uiteenlopende geloofsbeginsels; inderdaad 'n veelsydige nasie,
en tog kleurryk en interessant in sy diversiteit. Nog meer interessant is
die feit dat 'n eg Suid-Afrikaanse vrou, Saartjie Baartman, ons land se
politieke leiers tot stilstand bring op die vooraand van Suid-Afrika se
nasionale dag vir vroue. Saartjie is vir ons 'n herinnering aan erge
koloniale misbruik, gruwelike menseregteskending, rassistiese uitbuiting en
misbruik van en disrespek vir die vroulike liggaam. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[South Africa is indeed a nation with a multitude of peoples, 11 official
languages, many cultures and diverse religious principles; indeed a multi-
faceted nation, and yet colourful and interesting in its diversity. Even
more interesting is the fact that a true South African woman, Saartjie
Baartman, on the eve of South Africa's national day for women, is bringing
our country's political leaders to a standstill. To us Saartjie is a
reminder of severe colonial abuse, gross human rights violation, racist
exploitation and abuse of, and disrespect for, the female body.]

My question today is whether women in this country are better or worse off
since Saartjie's experiences. [Interjections.] I recall the four very young
girls of this country who were apparently abducted by the paedophile Gert
van Rooyen and have never since been found. Have they perhaps been raped,
abused, murdered or sold into prostitution in other countries? How many
women and children in this country have suffered gross humiliation, abuse,
neglect, rape and assault, intimidation and unfair labour practices only
because they are women and vulnerable?

Even though this Government has a portfolio committee in place that looks
at the rights and status of women, it still lacks the will to put
structures and resources in place to empower women sufficiently.
Internationally, South Africa ranks very high as far as illiteracy amongst
women is concerned. This is a sore point for women's groups, who claim that
current efforts and opportunities are weak and ineffectual.

Why does the ANC Government keep South African women poor and illiterate?
[Interjections.] I believe that improving literacy amongst women is the key
to improving women's political awareness and hence their status in society.
[Interjections.] A literate woman would know the difference between a good
and a weak government, and that is why some governments keep their women
poor and illiterate. They do so so that they remain dependent on the
government of the day.

Kaapstad Uniestad onder beheer van die DA is 'n leier op die gebied van
geslagsgelykheid en die bemagtiging van vroue. Agt vrouedirekteure is pas
aangestel as hoofde van sleutelportefeuljes in die Kaapstad-administrasie.
Kaapstad-munisipaliteit is voorwaar meer suksesvol as ander metro's omdat
dit nie deur die ANC geregeer word nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Cape Town Unicity, under control of the DA, is a leader in the field of
gender equality and empowerment of women. Eight female directors have just
been appointed in the Cape Town administration as heads of key portfolios.
The municipality of Cape Town is indeed more successful than other metros
because it is not governed by the ANC. [Interjections.][Applause.]]

Marthinus van Schalkwyk's dishing out of jobs for pals and the abuse of
taxpayers' moneys have once again proved that association brings
resemblance. How many New NP women did he appoint to his cabinet?
[Interjections.] Not one!

Ek wil vandag vroue aanmoedig om op te staan en hulle regmatige plek in die
samelewing in te neem. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Today, I would like to encourage women to stand up and take their rightful
place in society. [Interjections.]]

Without further ado, I suppose that there is a time to come and a time to
go. Today it is my turn to greet this House and also to say farewell to
colleagues and friends of the past eight years. [Interjections.] It has
indeed been an honour for me to be a part of the transition of this
country, especially at this level of government. [Interjections.]

Al het dit nie altyd so gelyk of geklink nie, kan ek agb lede verseker dat
ek 'n groot respek opgebou het vir kollegas aan albei kante van hierdie
Raad. Dit is die gebed van my hart dat God werklik vorentoe vir ons 'n nuwe
generasie leiers sal stuur, en dat hier werklike transformasie sal
plaasvind sodat ons eendag kan terugkyk na vandag as deel van ons land se
geskiedenis. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[Even if it did not always look or sound like it, I can assure hon members
that I developed huge respect for colleagues on both sides of this Council.
It is my heart's prayer that somewhere down the road, God would send us a
new generation of leaders, and that true transformation will take place
here so that one day we can look back to this day as part of our country's
history. [Interjections.]]
We can only rise up if we have experienced lows. Thank you, Madam Speaker,
for your excellent leadership. Thank you to all the staff members. May God
bless South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the IFP to take part, on
this very solemn occasion, in a very important debate. I wish to identify
myself with the hon Minister and the remarks she made on this topic.

I wish to address this topic under the title ``the enrobing of Sarah
Baartman''. Stripped of the covers of modesty, stripped of her identity and
the real name given to her by her parents, stripped of friends, family,
community, tribe, nation, belonging, motherland, dignity, political rights,
humanity, love, happiness, understanding, sympathy, empathy, communion and
everything else, how can Sarah Baartman be enrobed adequately to compensate
for everything that she was shorn of and all the humiliation heaped on her
by the former colonialists that held sway here and who dispossessed her and
her people of so many things?

Shakespeare made King Lear observe: ``Unaccommodated man is no more but
such a poor, bare, forked animal.'' Indeed, Sarah could vouch for that
seeing just how unaccommodated she was, a mere exotic object to the type
that the Minister described as those who trampled all over her humanity.
But our unique miracle as a nation is to see hope where it could not
possibly exist and light where darkness is at its most intense. This is our
miracle. Since 1994 we have begun to reverse the process of the endless
stripping by colonialists that damaged our people, our flora, fauna and our
country's resources. When we enrobe Sarah Baartman, metaphorically and
symbolically, we once again invest in ourselves all our rights, dignity and
humanity.

I want to begin by saying the following to Madam Speaker, all the women in
the Chamber, the gallery and the nation: In this extraordinary task of
enrobing, we, as that gender portion known as men, wherever we are and
whoever we are, should commit ourselves to supporting gender equality
implicitly and without any reserve. [Applause.] The enrobing of Sarah
Baartman is not one ceremony and certainly no single occasion. Sarah
Baartman is every woman in our land and, very particularly, every black
woman in the land [Applause].

When we consciously and with dedication educate each young girl to the
level of her potential; when we uplift each rural woman to become
economically independent; when we respect the right of each woman to her
bodily integrity; when we protect each girl-child and each woman against
rape and violence; when we allow each woman to come into her own and to
make choices and to have those choices respected, even if that choice means
that she insists on the use of a condom during intimacy; when we elevate
suitable women candidates to the most prestigious offices in the land so
that there is a systemic emancipation and empowerment of women, then we
would have fully enrobed Sarah Baartman and her ceremony would have been
complete. [Applause.]

Sarah Baartman is a direct and powerful challenge to former colonialists,
men and boys, all of us now living here in our country in the new
dispensation. In Africa the leadership role of women is as ancient as
history itself. I will cite only two examples. Queen Hatshepsut ruled Egypt
3 300 years ago and Queen Cleopatra also ruled over Egypt as far back as 2
030 years ago. It is nothing unusual in Africa for women to have led their
countries with great distinction and honour.

In enrobing Sarah we affirm the truth that everything in our political
lives comes full circle. Those that were once degraded and dehumanised are
now raised up in honour and are celebrated. Those who were taken by force
and compulsion in virtual chains are now being brought back home with love
and fond remembrance. Today we, who sit on these seats as power brokers,
will enrobe Sarah if we harken to Nkosi Buthelezi when he implores us,
regardless of where we belong, to commit passionately to a revolution of
goodwill, or if we were to make it our mantra, in tone with the elder
statesman Madiba, the incantation ``never and never and never again''.

Power is a corrosive thing; it is a potent acid. The Bible promises that
the meek shall inherit the earth. Believers who have God in their hearts
understand the power of love, the power of good will, the power of faith.
That is the power we should seek to develop and that is the power we must
use and encourage to be used as proselytes for genuine and untrammelled
democracy here and everywhere else in the world.

Each of us, more than anyone else in the world, needs to enrobe Sarah; the
poor and the destitute; the weak and the helpless; the uneducated and the
unskilled; the homeless and the hungry; men and women; boys and girls -
then, and only then, will power work for the betterment of society, instead
of just for the gratification of big and petty tyrants and dictators. North
of us and in many other places, tyranny and despotism are common things. In
such countries colonialism ended, but true freedom is as absent now as it
has been for a very long time.

When we participate in the enrobing of Sarah, we are symbolically also
enrobing all the girls and women of our land who are ravaged by hunger,
joblessness, violence and intimidation. The impact of HIV/Aids on women is
considerably more dramatic than on men, and if we fail women at this
critical juncture, our society, in less than two decades, will have a
severe imbalance in the ratio between the gender groups on account of the
higher mortality rate among women through HIV/Aids.

Today we have an opportunity to commit ourselves to the gender-equal
society in the world and to freeing women from oppression, violence, rape
and abuse. Let us together enrobe Sarah and in doing so let us act in
unison against the degradation of our fellow beings, mother earth and those
who are most precious to us, namely our daughters, mothers and wives, our
equal partners in the journey of life.

Let the coming Woman's Day be a watershed. Sarah, sister, we embrace you to
ourselves. May God similarly embrace you and raise you! [Applause.]

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Madam Speaker, I believe that this day is a day of
mourning. We are burying Sarah Baartman who died 200 years ago and I
therefore believe that we should bury her with the dignity and respect that
she deserves.

Ngoko ke andisayi kungena emxhentsweni nasemtshotshweni wokuba i-ANC
ayilunganga okanye ilungile. Ndicinga into yokuba namhlanje yimini yokuba
sihloniphe. Xa singcwaba eAfrika, singcwaba ngesithozela. Nokuba umntu
lutshaba lwakho umngcwaba ngothando; umngcwaba ngentlonipho. Ndiya kucela
ke ukuba oomama nootata kule Ndlu namhlanje bathethe ... (Translation of
Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[I am not going to enter the debate about whether the ANC is good or not. I
think that today is a day to show respect. When we bury the dead in Africa,
we do it in dignity. Even if a person was your enemy; you bury them with
love. I will therefore, ask women and men in this House today to speak ...]

... in unity and with the dignity that Sarah deserves.

UMphathiswa wethu wezeZindlu sele esivulele ngokunika imbali kaSarah
Baartman. USarah Baartman ube kokuveliswe kukuhlupheka, ebesebunzimeni
bocinezelo phantsi kwe colonialism nobuhlanga. (Translation of Xhosa
paragraph follows.)

[The Minister of Housing has given an introduction to the history of Sarah
Baartman. Sarah Baartman was a product of poverty and was oppressed and
exploited under colonialism and racism.]

Sarah Baartman, like all African women in this country, suffered all forms
of exploitation and oppression.

Baye bafika ke kweli lizwe bayitshabalalisa inkcubeko yethu,
bazitshabalalisa iilwimi zethu. Yiyo loo nto abanye bethu bengazi ukuba
umntu uziphatha njani na emngcwabeni. Umntu uye afike emngcwabeni eze
kudelela ngathi ucinga ukuba kusemtshotshweni. Ngoko ke xa sikhumbula,
eAfrika sasingenayo imida. Sasingenaye umSuthu nomTswane; sasingabantu
sonke. Siyazi ukuba amakhosi ethu ayephuma aye kuzeka kwamanye amazwe
akude, kungekho calu-calulo.

Masikhumbule kwakhona ukuba bona oomama aba bamaKhoi namaSan babezekwa
ngootata bethu. Kwakusithi xa kuyiwa emfazweni amakhosikazi angabulawa.
Amakhosikazi ebehlonitshwa, abuyiswe, agcinwe, azekwe, abe ngabanye babantu
besi sizwe. Nabantwana babo bebegcinwa, behlonitshiwe. Thina kwaXhosa
nolwimi lwethu lunazo izinto oluzifumeneyo phaya koluya lwimi lwamaKhoi
namaSan. Siyayazi into yokuba nabeTswana ngokunjalo bahleli kunye
bephilisana kusendiselwana namaKhoi namaSan, simntu mnye.

Sitsho ke sisithi, siyayazi into yokuba abeLungu bafika bayitshabalalisa
yonke into, baqala baseka imida, benza ucalu-calulo, basahlula. Bathabatha
amakhosikazi bawatshabalalisa bawenza ayinto yokudlala emhlabeni. Ngoko ke
ndifuna ukuthi uthe sele efile uSarah Baartman ... (Translation of Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[They arrived in this country and destroyed our culture and languages. That
is the reason some of us do not know how they should conduct themselves at
funerals. A person would come to where a funeral is being held and take
people for granted as if it were at a Xhosa dance ceremony. When we try to
remember, in Africa we never had boundaries. There was no Sotho or Tswana;
we were just human beings. We know that traditional leaders sought wives
from far countries and there was no discrimination.

Let us again remember that our fathers took Khoi and San women as wives.
During times of war, women would be spared. Women were respected and
treated with dignity, would be brought back, cared for and well looked
after, be married and be part of that nation. Their children were also
saved and treated with dignity. We as amaXhosa as well as our language,
have things that we gained from the language of the Khoi and the San. We
also know that the Tswanas too lived together with them, exchanged
marriages, and were united.

These things were destroyed when the white people came as they introduced
boundaries and discrimination and racism, and divided us. They killed women
and made fun of them. Even when Sarah Baartman had died ...]

... she continued to endure this degradation and suffering because the
colonial and racist rulers believed that she was not a human being.

She was kept naked in a cave; when she died they were very much interested
in her body. They were very much interested in her brain, because they
believed that she was not human, that she was an animal. They did their
research, they did an inspection and analysis of her body and, in the end,
they found that she was a human being. But because she was black, they kept
her there for 200 years, continuing to humiliate her and make her an object
of their entertainment.

Therefore, ...

... sifuna ukuthi namhlanje sikhahlela ... [... today we want to salute
...]

... it is the Government of the ANC that has gone and brought back Sarah
Baartman and made sure that they organised a dignified burial for her after
200 years.

Ndifuna ukuthetha ngentsingiselo yomhla we-9 ka-Agasti. [I want to talk
about the significance of 9 August.]

The day 9 August is a significant and historic day for the people of South
Africa, in particular women. It is a day on which we remember our
struggles, the women's struggle in South Africa. It is a day on which we
remember our victories. Therefore, it is very significant that Sarah
Baartman is buried on this day, the day of women in South Africa, because
Sarah Baartman is a symbol of all African women in this country. In fact,
she is a symbol of all women who suffer degradation, exploitation,
harassment, violence and abuse. We, therefore, want to say, ``Let all of us
honour this day, let all of us go and bury Sarah Baartman.''

The ANC has declared the month of August as the month for women's
emancipation as part of the Letsima programme. The ANC Women's League's
theme for this month is, ``Restore our dignity, respect our human rights
and together let's work for sustainable development''.

The burial of Sarah Baartman tomorrow, therefore, signifies and heralds a
new era, when women's dignity and women's human rights will be respected
and restored. It is a new era during which we must call for unity and peace
in our country.

We therefore commit ourselves, during this month, to continue with our
programmes to mobilise and unite women, and also with our programmes to
fight for women's rights and for peace in our country.

We also call on men and women to fight violence and abuse of women and
children. We say enough is enough. Let us not have another baby Tshepang.
We also salute and commend baby Tshepang for her record healing and also
say she has also shown a spirit of resilience during her traumatic time
because of the hope and the prayers of our women, as well as the
contribution of our Government to ensuring that the issues of child abuse
and women's abuse are addressed. Today the person who is responsible for
what happened to Tshepang has finally been brought to book. Therefore we
believe that this will be a lesson to all those men out there who still
want to abuse women, who still want to abuse our children and who still do
not believe that women must be respected. We hope that this will show them
that our Government is serious and our Government means business in
protecting our women and fighting all this abuse and corruption.

We also call on all of us to recommit ourselves to the programme to fight
the spread of HIV and Aids. We call, especially, on those who have started
home-based care programmes. We ask our Government to put more resources
into these programmes and also provide more resources for the orphans who
need our support and protection. We must also regenerate our energy and
make sure that we support the moral regeneration campaign, because all
these evils would not be there if we were committed to this campaign.

With regard to poverty alleviation, I also want to call on all of us, it is
not just the responsibility of the Government. I believe that our
Government has opened up opportunities. There are various programmes and
schemes that have been opened up by this Government to ensure that we are
able to start small businesses, that we are able to organise ourselves, and
therefore I call on women, in particular, who mostly bear the brunt of
poverty, to organise themselves and to take advantage of these
opportunities.

I also want to call on our Government and our NGOs to take up support of
the literacy programme, because we know that most of the people who are
illiterate today are women, especially women in the rural areas. I think,
during this year of the volunteer, let us volunteer during our time, our
recess, and let us go out to the rural areas and make sure that we initiate
meaningful literacy programmes that will empower our women with skills, not
only to be able to read and write, but to be able to set up developmental
programmes that will sustain them and their families.

As women we are also committing ourselves to the African Union. We know
that most of the programmes and the processes of the AU have left women
behind. But we are saying we are going to take over and take up the
programme of the AU and Nepad. We are calling for a monitoring body within
Nepad that will ensure that there is gender mainstreaming in all the
programmes and structures of Nepad. Our Parliament has already committed
itself, so that we have 60% representation in all Nepad structures, because
Nepad is about development and without women, we believe, there can never
be development in Africa.

With regard to the World Summit on Sustainable Development, WSSD, we are
again saying that women must participate in that programme. The ANC Women's
League, together with women NGOs in South Africa, has organised a
programme, an international women's tent that will be based in Nasrec,
where various programmes to empower women will be presented. We are also
organising a train that will be departing from the Great Lakes region, move
to Uganda, down South, touching on all the countries of Africa, which will
highlight the HIV/Aids campaign and peace and stability in Africa.

Therefore, we are asking women in South Africa to make sure that they are
involved in these programmes and also receive the women and the people who
will be coming to participate in the UN conference, so that when they go
back home they have a good a picture and have learnt from and shared our
own experiences and our democracy. [Time expired.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, I would also like, on behalf of the New NP,
to extend a welcome to the women in the gallery, many of whom, I am aware,
are prominent in local government. It is an honour and a pleasure as a
woman to speak in this debate on Sarah, or Saartjie, Baartman. Let me deal
with her name first. According to the Khoisan legal advisor, on her birth
and marriage certificates she appears as Sarah Baartman, but in the
``volksmond'', as an expression of love and affection, she is referred to
as ``Saartjie.'' I have been asked by our caucus on this occasion, on the
advice of our Khoisan members, to refer to her as ``Saartjie'' in my speech
today.

The interment of Saartjie Baartman tomorrow in her homeland nearly 200
years after she was lured to Europe with the promise of fame and fortune,
holds lessons for South Africa and the Western World - lessons
unfortunately learned too late to benefit Saartjie and the multitude of her
fellow Africans who had at that time, and during the intervening period,
endured untold suffering. Saartjie was, allegedly at any rate, a free woman
when she got to England, though she was exploited and humiliated as a freak
and a mere object by a prurient and voyeuristic European audience. Her
human dignity was ignored and demeaned and she had previously been enslaved
like millions of her fellow Africans, who were enslaved in horrific
circumstances, and of whose suffering we should also be mindful at a time
like this.

As South Africans we should be proud of the Government action to retrieve
Saartjie Baartman's remains from France, where they were insultingly on
display for years and then stored at the Museum of Mankind in Paris. Former
President Mandela, who initiated the request for her remains to be handed
back in 1994, and Deputy Minister Brigitte Mabandla who negotiated the
return, should be congratulated on their initiative.

It is extraordinary that Saartjie Baartman's remains continued to be
displayed in France until 1974, in contravention of all tenets of human
rights applicable in France, Europe and the rest of the world, and in spite
of the international adoption of the United Nations' Declaration on Human
Rights 30 years previously. ``Why''? we must ask. And the answer must lie
in the fact that people and their attitudes are conditioned by their
history, as written or handed down. Accordingly, the most important lesson
to be learned from Saartjie Baartman's story is that our received history
needs to be reassessed, re-examined and, if found wanting, challenged and
rewritten.

Europe's interest in women like Saartjie Baartman was aroused originally by
writers like Le Valiant, the French explorer and hunter, who wrote about
his travels and exploits in Southern Africa in the eighteenth century. He
wrote about Hottentots and Khoisan women in a section of his writings and
drawings entitled ``Behind the Hottentot Apron'' in which he described
certain physical peculiarities allegedly possessed by these women. Now this
was not regarded then as eighteenth century porn or even as something
insulting to the dignity of these women or their nations as a whole, but
merely as a valid commentary on the so-called natives of the dark
continent, which then became part of received history and subsequently went
unquestioned.

When Saartjie Baartman was brought to England and France and displayed as
more or less a wild animal or subhuman, no one regarded it as strange. The
history that many of us in this House have learned at school, and even at
university, was predicated on, or even derived from, records of this
nature, manifesting attitudes that are completely in conflict now with our
respect for human rights, our commitment to equality for women and the
human dignity of all people as guaranteed in our Constitution and in
international conventions. Accordingly, it is up to us to ensure that our
documents and our history reflect our values and that such attitudes,
completely inimical to our values today, are not retained or passed on to
our children.

Saartjie Baartman was not the oddity. The attitudes of Le Valiant and
others, almost exclusively male and European writers and commentators of
the previous era, are indeed the oddity. Saartjie Baartman had a short and
tragic life. She was only 27 when she died in 1816. Because she made the
mistake of going to Europe where, as the Dutch poet Dianna Ferrus has
depicted in her touching poem, she was subject to ``the poking eyes of the
man-made monster who lives in the dark with his racist clutches of
imperialism, who dissects your body bit by bit.’’

Now she has been brought home to be laid to rest, but she must not be
forgotten. She must become a symbol, not only for the Khoisan, but for all
the women of Africa who during this millennium are reclaiming their dignity
and their human rights.

On the eve of national Women's Day, we must also be mindful that the
impairment of, and the disregard for, human dignity and the rights of women
of our continent do not only derive from an imperialist and colonial
heritage, but also from our own cultural and societal practices. Where
these impact negatively on women they must be revised or removed. Let
Saartjie Baartman be a reminder to us all of where we want to go in
reclaiming the human dignity of African women. [Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, the dedication of this debate to the
memory of Sarah Baartman is both fitting and inspirational. We cannot undo
the suffering of Sarah Baartman and the many others who suffered a similar
fate, but the return of and the laying to rest of Baartman's remains is a
victory for human dignity, and serves as encouragement to ensure that we do
everything in our power to reclaim the dignity and rights of all women.

The South African Constitution enshrines the rights and dignity of all
people in South Africa. It ensures that women will have equal rights to
their male counterparts and that they will never again have to suffer the
humiliation that Sarah Baartman experienced.

Today, we must, however, ask ourselves whether we are doing enough so that
these guaranteed rights in the Constitution become a living reality for the
majority of South African women. I believe that none of us can stand here
today and say with a clear conscience that we have achieved equality,
upliftment and empowerment for all women in South Africa. There are still
too many women in every corner of South Africa who are not yet aware of
their rights, and who certainly have no access to their constitutional
guarantees.

It is only once women can achieve a certain level of independence that the
dignity of women will be restored and that they will be able to take up
their rights completely. Women must be enabled to break free from their
current circumstances. Their inability to do so is as a result of their
economic and emotional dependence. If we empower women in these spheres, we
will begin the process of restoring dignity.

Women bear the brunt of poverty. Too little is done in order to focus
specifically on the economic empowerment of women. Ironically, it is left
to women to find ways to feed and care for their families in the face of
utter despair and, miraculously, they do so with little available.

The UDM believes that, given the necessary support and encouragement, women
will take that resolve and turn it into economically viable opportunities.
Women are not asking for hand-outs. They simply must be given the necessary
opportunity and encouragement. Programmes must be developed that aim to
give specifically women access to land and capital.

Too many women remain the victims of rape, abuse and violent crimes. Many
of these crimes are committed against women by family members, their
partners, or people known to them. This also demonstrates the desperate
situation that many of these women find themselves in and who, because of
their economic dependency, are unable to break free from these situations.
Living in a crime-ridden society with no access to capital, little or no
basic education or skills training, and not owning any land or other
productive resources leave women with very little opportunity of becoming
economically active and breaking free from the circumstances that they
currently find themselves in.

The role of women in our community cannot be overemphasised. Women,
mothers, sisters and wives form the backbone of our society. It is on the
lap of his mother that a baby learns about life. It is at the hand of his
mother that he learns about what is wrong and right. It is through the
words spoken by her that he learns to speak. Why then do we imagine it to
be possible to talk about the upliftment and empowerment of the nation when
we do not put in place the basic foundation required?

Our priority, undoubtedly, must be to reclaim the dignity and rights of our
women as individuals and as an entity. It is only once this is achieved
that success for the nation will follow.

Just as the return of Sarah Baartman symbolises the strength of women in
the face of despair, let her return encourage us to work in unity to
achieve dignity for women throughout South Africa, not only for those in
cities, but specifically for those in the deepest rural areas who are, in
all modesty, simply being mothers to a nation, for it is only once women
can take up their rightful place in society without fear that we will be
able to say that we have achieved freedom and dignity at last.

May Sarah Baartman rest in peace. May her memories inspire us to make
Africa a warm Mother Africa for all her children, including the girl child,
both in dignity and in right. [Applause.]

Ms J MOLOI: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, we have gone
a long way in the liberation of women and transformation of gender
relations, and we still have a long way to go for the total liberation of
women from apartheid and colonialism to a just and egalitarian society
based on social security, economic prosperity and equal justice.

In observing August as women's month and in celebration of national Women's
Day, that is tomorrow, 9 August, we have to congratulate the Department of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, particularly Deputy Minister
Bridgette Mabandla, on a job well done in bringing home a woman of this
South African soil, Sarah Baartman, for proper burial as part of restoring
women's dignity and human rights, thus symbolising a new beginning.
We salute all the women who were bold enough to take to the streets in
1956, fighting against the oppressive pass laws and, therefore, paving the
way for the basis for a gender struggle. Without any doubts, that beginning
has borne the many fruits that we are reaping today. It is important to
take stock of the impact on the progress made by this young South African
democracy, lest we forget. We created the national gender machinery that
asserts women within all spheres of governance, for instance the Office on
the Status of Women, in Government; the Joint Monitoring Committee on the
Improvement of Quality of Life and the Status of Women, in Parliament;
independent bodies such as the Commission on Gender Equality; in civil
society, with various community-based organisations, political
organisations and NGOs that deal with gender issues.

As South Africans, we are proud to realise that many countries envy our
gender management system, and we are recognised as having the most advanced
instrument in the implementation and mainstreaming of gender. Therefore, we
feel that we have made quite a significant impact.

We salute our efforts of ensuring that the gender programme exists at
international level where the Beijing Platform for Action and Cedaw serve
as international instruments utilised in the implementation of the gender
programme. We have succeeded in coming up with the gender and development
programme for SADC, and we have to ensure that we continue with the
integration of gender on the whole African continent by engendering the
Nepad programme as a challenge facing us.

In a short space of time, we have managed to assert women within the
political and decision-making processes, both in Government and in
Parliament, though much still has to be done and will be achieved through
the implementation of the Employment Equity Act, which is currently in
place.

We have noticed that only the ANC as political organisation here in
Parliament has come up with a quota system to involve women in decision-
making. We are, therefore, challenging other parties to follow the example
of the ANC to ensure that they have a clear mechanism to involve women and
not depend on the ANC. In fact, we would prefer to have binding legislation
that will ensure continuous women's representation in Parliament.

Private institutions in our country are not an exception in respect of this
issue. They have to implement the policies of this country. Therefore, this
means that they also have to show an integration of gender and involvement
of women in decision-making, and ensuring that all other provisions are
being implemented, particularly the Employment Equity Act.

On the aspect of violence against women, there is a lot to be done, because
we have a lot of problems in this area. There are achievements, and most of
the laws have been enacted, like the Maintenance Act and the Domestic
Violence Act, and serious attention is drawn to sexual harassment. It is no
longer loose and just running itself and not being attended to.

The tightening up of the criminal justice system is yet another factor that
needs to be applauded. We still raise, with serious concerns, the high rate
of child molestation and rape cases, and we feel that they still need quite
a lot of attention. If the whole society could join together, we could be
able to come up with a mechanism of making sure that we restore the dignity
of our society.

Many more areas of focus on the Beijing Platform for Action and Cedaw have
been integrated in the Government programme and are currently being
implemented. We will be able to produce the country's report reflecting our
progress in these two areas. In other words, the integration of these
programmes is quite visible in a number of other areas that are identified
by the Beijing Platform for Action and Cedaw. As a matter of fact, as a
country we must be proud to have a report that reflects the significant
progress that we have made.

Part of what can restore women's dignity is the eradication of poverty that
degrades women to the level of beggars. We need to come up with a strategy
that will impact on the economic lives of poor women. It is impossible to
speak of dignity whilst we are unable to put food on the table for our
children. To remind ourselves of what was said by women on 9 August 1956,
whilst they were marching to the Union Buildings, I would like to quote:
``We shall not rest until we have won for our children their fundamental
right to freedom, justice and security''. In order for us to achieve this,
we need to consolidate all the efforts and ensure that we really work hard
as a nation to fulfil those aspirations of freedom, justice and security
for the young ones.

Government has initiated the integrated rural development strategy, and the
Presidency has identified nodal points countrywide for the implementation
of this strategy. Through the rolling programme of the integrated rural
development strategy located within local government, the poor communities
will benefit from this programme. In addition to the integrated planning
process undertaken by Government, cluster programmes are initiated in order
to ensure that the collective approach to planning and implementation is
worked on. Gender programmes are integrated and mainstreamed within this
approach, and all heads of various clusters are expected to report on the
gender progress. Whilst doing this, they would be within the auspices of
the administration and cluster heads.

What becomes a major challenge at this point in time, which we feel has not
quite made a major impact, is the integration of gender at the level of
procurement management, financial systems and the Public Finance Management
Act's implementation and the co-ordination located within the national
Treasury. If this could be done correctly and well, it would take care of
mainstreaming gender in the office of the state's Tender Board, procurement
management, the public finance management implementation unit, and in the
entire financial system.

The Presidency has a role to co-ordinate gender activities, and we feel and
believe that that role is correctly placed and should continue that way. We
also have to make sure that the Public Service develops a mechanism of
monitoring and evaluation to assist the implementation of the gender
programmes within the departments. In fact, we do not want to leave this
area to the officials whose focus is not on gender. But, if they are taken
up by heads of department and heads of various clusters, we are sure that
we would be able to analyse its impact and the integration of the gender
programme.
In conclusion, I would like to say that whilst we are engaged with various
gender activities in this Women's Month, it will be proper for all
societies, both women and men, actively to deal with the HIV/Aids
programmes in order to fight the scourge. We have to focus on home-based
programmes, on counselling of the affected and the infected, and to engage
in education programmes, as well as awareness campaigns.

As women, we have to challenge men to play an active role in HIV/Aids,
because Aids is not an area that is only concentrated on women, but faces
the whole of society. By saying so, we really appeal to men to be at the
forefront of dealing with HIV/Aids.

I also wish to congratulate the community of Orange Farm, currently named
Palestine, for joining hands on the girl-child programme that pays
particular attention to HIV/Aids sensitisation amongst the youth, and to
countering gender violence that ravages society, with specific reference to
a number of programmes that deal with gender violence. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Father, Jesus, Holy Spirit, I acknowledge You. Madam Speaker,
ACDP Women of Destiny, ladies and gentlemen, loss of person, place,
potential, future and pride - today trafficking in women is a multibillion
dollar market and in Sarah's days someone was also profiting from her being
demeaned, ridiculed, shamed and degraded. Traffickers and pimps, past and
present, prey on the dreams and vulnerabilities of women seeking employment
and opportunities for the future.

Research shows the most popular destinations for traffic in women are
countries where prostitution is legal. And now, South Africa is brazenly,
knowingly and wilfully contemplating decriminalising and legalising
prostitution and joining their ranks. South Africa will no longer be a
transit country as it is today, but a legalised and official destination.
Legalisation of prostitution not only causes an increase in trafficking in
women to meet the demand created by a legalised sex industry, but makes it
difficult to hold traffickers accountable for their activities, as
traffickers and pimps evade prosecution by claiming the women knew what
they were getting into.

Prosecutors have a hard time establishing the line between voluntary and
forced prostitution when it is legal, as their case depends on proving that
the woman did not consent. Women like Sarah will have no more protection in
South Africa, once prostitution is decriminalised, than she had in Europe.
Slavery was a hot topic at the time when Sarah was being exploited and a
young Jamaican pressured government to intervene in her situation, but the
courts ruled that Sarah had entered into a contract of her own free will
and the exploitation went on.

The head of operations for the UN Centre for International Crime Prevention
says that the laws help gangsters. Prostitution is semi-legal in many
places and that makes the enforcement tricky. Sweden recently passed a law
to combat violence against women that created a new offence, the gross
violation of a woman's dignity. Prostitution is included as a type of
violence against women and the purchase of sexual services is now
prohibited and punishable. Sweden's approach recognises the harm done to
women under conditions of sexual exploitation. It is premised on the belief
that women have the right to dignity, integrity and equality. In holding
users accountable this new law effectively targets the demand for
trafficking in women. This example should be commended and emulated.

South Africa has rightly judged the actions of those who trafficked, pimped
and aided and abetted these heinous, inhuman crimes against Sarah and
should not now condemn itself by decriminalising these same actions within
our own boundaries.

Prostitution, sex tourism, trafficking in women and other practices that
reduce women to sexual commodities have had a particularly devastating
impact on women in developing countries and oppressed groups of women in so-
called developed countries. The sexual exploitation of any woman is cruel,
inhuman and degrading treatment, establishes the standard of treatment for
all women and is incompatible with the inherent dignity and worth of the
human person.

The ACDP welcomes the return of Sarah Baartman's remains to South Africa as
significant in a process of reclaiming dignity and identity and the healing
of a people and a nation who have experienced the deep hurt. However,
sadly, even in death Sarah is being paraded and gawked at if one watches
television and the little inserts that are meant to salute her. The father
heart of God breaks. She was made in His image.

As far as I know, Government is not putting money at any level toward homes
where women who have been in prostitution try to take themselves out of
that lifestyle and make a new life for themselves. There are homes like the
house in Hillbrow and Beauty for Ashes here in the Western Cape who
desperately need our help and assistance, because they are doing an
incredible work at this time. Beauty for Ashes, a home for women who choose
to turn from prostitution and make a new life is right here in the centre
of Cape Town and they are on www.giveandgain.com. Members can also get
their details from our offices. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Sarah Baartman story
epitomises the lack of dignity accorded to African women and this by people
who claim to be proclaiming the word of God. Sarah's story is a real
manifestation of man's inhumanity to man that causes countless to mourn.
With the advent of imperial power, indigenous culture was thrown out of the
window. Inferiority was imposed on Africans. The so-called master race
decided what to do and when to do it with the African folk. While Africans
were subjected to servitude, the women carried a double burden. They were
kept at the bottom of the social and economic hierarchy and were employed
in low-paying unskilled jobs.

We appreciate that in the midst of all the humiliation and degradation,
African women stood up and spoke out. They have shown their mettle in a
maze of adversity. Despite the debasement of Sarah, we have icons we can
look up to, and we note the half-full rather than the half-empty glasses at
our disposal.

Charlotte Maxeke, born Manye, comes to mind. This jewel of Africa went to
study at the Wilberforce University in the United States of America. On her
return, she not only brought back her deserved degree, she also learnt
about the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This church was founded by
slaves of African origin staging a walkout from the Methodist Church
because of the inhuman treatment meted out to them by the supremacist
whites during worship service.

It is important that we look forward in life and not remain bitter about
what happened to Sarah Baartman. That is past. We should concentrate on how
to restore dignity and respectability to African women. All we have to know
is that women have an equal right to dignity, integrity and life. They have
not been created from the crumbs that fell off the Master's table as He was
creating men. Women have rights that should not be violated in any way.

We should acquaint ourselves with instruments such as the Beijing
Declaration and Platform for Action of 1995, the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women as adopted by the
United Nations in 1979, and pieces of legislation passed by this Parliament
such as the Domestic Violence Act in order to appreciate that all gender-
based violence has to be frowned upon regardless of who the perpetrator is.

Surely we have to contain the spiral of violence in South Africa?
Intervention strategies have to be sought to eradicate this pervasive
problem. There is truth forever in the words: ``The first shall be the
last, and the last shall be the first.'' Sarah Baartman, a woman once
degraded, has since been placed on a pedestal of glory. She is an icon with
whom all yearn to be associated. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the struggle to bring the remains of Sarah
Baartman back to her motherland is a great victory for human rights. She
belongs here, and the soil of Africa wanted her back here. Those who
enslaved her and deported her to a foreign country and then dehumanised her
and made a public spectacle of her are psychologically sick and in need of
healing.

Many years ago a celebrated member of this House, the hon Sam Khan,
described racism as a mixture of biological ignorance and racial
superstition. And so it is. It makes some people develop a superiority
which is completely unjustified and baseless.

The heroic and dignified burial of Sarah Baartman on Women's Day should
send a message to all and sundry that human dignity is a God-given
attribute and that those who violate it violate God, in whose image human
beings are created. The only unfortunate thing is that Sarah Baartman is
being buried in a country where, lately, there has been unacceptable levels
of violence and indignity inflicted on our womenfolk. The message from this
House and from the burial service of Baartman should be clear: Violence
against women comes from sick men who are also cowards. Real men should
engage other men in brutal fights in which they will get what they deserve
- blow by blow. There is no heroism whatsoever in subjecting your beloved
wife to physical torture, brutality and savagery.

In African society of old a family court, representing both families, would
meet and condemn this behaviour and attempt to do some counselling. If this
did not work, a tribal court would be appealed to. Their judgment and
verdict would result in public punishment that would be so severe that very
few would want to repeat the crime. One can contrast this with our modern
form of imprisonment in hotel-type prisons. We have a lot to learn from
African jurisprudence, particularly the element of peer and societal
rejection of antisocial and inhuman behaviour. This African lifestyle was
not inferior or uncivilised. It was a society and lifestyle which should be
the envy of many civilised men and women. We salute Sarah Bartman.

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mevrou die Speaker, die Federale Alliansie is dankbaar
dat die Parlement 'n paar uur wy aan die geskiedenis van Saartjie Baartman.
Maklik sal politici haar treurige lewensverhaal misbruik vir eie gewin,
want reeds het ons gesien dat haar liggaamsbou tydens haar leeftyd misbruik
is deur hartelose individue om hul verwronge rasse-vooroordele te
regverdig.

Die vraag is waarom maghebbendes deur die geskiedenis van die mens die
magteloses en dikwels die fisiek benadeeldes misbruik het vir hul eie
magsposisies, om hulself sodoende te versterk. Waarom kan ons nie nederig
voor die Skepper staan, dankbaar dat ons in posisies geplaas is om reg te
laat geskied teenoor die benadeeldes in ons gemeenskap en ons nasie nie? Ek
glo dat die terugbring van Saartjie Baartman se stoflike oorskot na haar
vaderland 'n boodskap inhou vir die moderne wêreld: 'n Boodskap van
versoening van rasse eerder as 'n geleentheid waar verwyte geslinger word
oor wandade van voorgeslagte wat lank gelede begrawe is. Saartjie se
tragiese geskiedenis het min te doen met rassisme, dit het alles te doen
met die mens se beheptheid met ander mense se fisieke voorkoms en ons
verwaandheid om benadeeldes as minderwaardige mense te etiketteer.

Ons, wat die voordeel van geleerdheid, tegnologie en die moderne wetenskap
het, moet Saartjie se herbegrafnis aangryp om Suid-Afrikaners te leer dat
elke mens, ten spyte van sy of haar fisieke voorkoms, 'n gelyke reg op
eerbied en respek het, maak nie saak van sy of haar staanplek in ons nasie
of in ons gemeenskap nie.

Deur die eeue heen was daar vroue wat leidende rolle in die geskiedenis
gespeel het. Dink maar aan Helen van Troje, Kleopatra en die Koningin van
Skeba. Meer onlangs was daar Eva Peron, Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Margaret
Thatcher, en hier tuis, Helen Suzman en vele ander vroue. Selde nog het ons
nasie hom so sterk vereenselwig met die onreg wat teenoor 'n vrou gepleeg
was soos wat ons nou doen oor Saartjie Baartman en wat aan haar gedoen is
nie. 'n Honderd jaar gelede is die Afrikanervrou leed aangedoen en het ons
vir haar en haar kinders 'n monument opgerig. Hierdie naweek en vandag sê
ek namens die Afrikaners, ons is nie bereid om toe te laat dat die Saartjie
Baartmans van Afrika agtergeblewe bly in ons eerbetoon aan vroue en dogters
van Afrika nie. [Tussenwerpsels].

Ons dank die Skepper dat ons so kort na die skepping van die nuwe Suid-
Afrika ook hierdie onreg gepleeg teenoor 'n vrou van Afrika kan regstel.
Daarom wil ons by hierdie geleentheid vir die vroue van Suid-Afrika sê:
``Julle het 'n unieke rol om in die Afrika-renaissance te speel. Bly
nederig, liefdevol, sagmoedig en vroulik, dan sal jy as vrou met agting en
respek bejeën word en sal ons en ons nageslag vir julle monumente bou''.

Ons is bly dat die onreg wat teenoor Saartjie gepleeg is, reggestel word.
Die DA sal help om vroue en ander benadeeldes se regte in Afrika te
verdedig en vestig, want ons is trots op die vroue en die dogters van ons
land.

Ek wil afsluit met die opmerking: Politieke aktiviste is snaakse ``mense.
Net gister nog het sommige van hulle vroue'' ge-necklace'' om politieke
redes, môre daag hulle dalk by die begrafnis op.[Tussenwerpsels].
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, the Federal Alliance is grateful to
Parliament for dedicating a few hours to the story of Saartjie Baartman.
Politicians will misuse her sad life story with ease for personal gain,
because we have already seen that in her lifetime her physique was abused
by heartless individuals to justify their warped racial prejudice.

The question is why, throughout man's history, the powerful that be have
abused the powerless and often the physically challenged to further their
own positions of power, in order thereby to fortify themselves. Why can we
not stand humbly before the Creator, grateful to have been placed in
positions to let justice be done to the aggrieved within our society and
our nation? I believe that the return of Saartjie Baartman's mortal remains
to her land of birth holds a message for the modern world: A message of
reconciliation of races rather than an occasion at which slurs are hurled
about regarding the atrocities of previous generations that have long since
been buried. Saartjie's tragic story has little to do with racism and
everything with man's obsession with other people's physical appearance and
our conceitedness in labelling those who have been aggrieved as being
inferior people.

We, who have the advantage of learning, technology and modern science, must
seize Saartjie's reburial as an opportunity to teach South Africans that
everyone, despite his or her physical appearance, has an equal right to
reverence and respect, irrespective of his or her standing in our nation or
society.

Through the ages there have been women who have played leading roles in
history. Think about Helen of Troy, Cleopatra and the Queen of Sheba. More
recently we had Eva Peron, Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher,
and here at home, Helen Suzman and many other women. Seldom before has our
nation identified itself so intensively with the injustice perpetrated
against a woman as is now the case with Saartjie Baartman and what was done
to her. One hundred years ago the Afrikaner woman was ill-treated and we
erected a monument for her and her children. This weekend and today I will
say on behalf of the Afrikaners that we refuse to let Saartjie Baartman lag
behind in our tribute to the women and girls of Africa. [Interjections.]

We thank our Creator that, so soon after the creation of the new South
Africa, we can also rectify this injustice perpetrated against a woman of
Africa. That is why on this occasion we want to say to the women of South
Africa: ``You have a unique role to play in the African Renaissance. Remain
modest, loving, gentle and feminine, then as a woman you will be treated
with esteem and respect and we and our descendants will build monuments for
you’’.

We are glad that the injustices perpetrated against Saartjie Baartman are
being rectified. The DA will help to establish and protect the rights of
women and other wronged persons in Africa, because we are proud of the
women and the girls of our country.

I want to conclude with this remark: Political activists are strange
people. Only yesterday some of them were necklacing women for political
reasons, but tomorrow they may turn up at the funeral. [Interjections.]]

Mrs M S MAINE: Madam Speaker, hon members, the Beijing Platform of Action
of 1995 defines violence against women as any act of gender-based violence
that results in, or is likely to, result in physical, sexual or
psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts,
coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Whether occurring in public
or private life, violence against women is one of the most brutal
consequences of the economic, social, political and cultural inequalities
that exist between men and women.

It is also perpetuated by legal and political systems that have
historically discriminated against women. The international community has
recognised that sexual violence against women constitutes a violation of
their human rights and fundamental freedoms. Sexual violence further
constitutes violation of a woman's reproductive rights, particularly her
right to bodily integrity and to control her sexuality and reproductive
capacity. Rape, female circumcision, female genital mutilation and forced
sterilisation are among the types of violence that violate women's
reproductive rights.

Sexual violence occurs in both the private and public spheres of women's
lives. It constitutes a human rights violation whether the perpetrator is
an agent of the state or a private citizen. Sexual violence can occur
against individuals of any age, within the family or any other
relationship, within the community or in the workplace, during situations
of armed conflict or any other time or place.

The international community has specifically recognised women's and girls'
rights to be free from sexual violence in various international human
rights treaties. For example, the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination Against Women, called Cedaw, was adopted by the
United Nations in 1979, and compels states to prohibit trafficking in
women. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
and the Women's Convention protects a woman's right to health, including
her physical, psychological, reproductive and sexual health.

In addition, the 1998 Rome Treaty forming the International Criminal Court
states, for the first time under international law, that rape, sexual
slavery, enforcement, prostitution, forced pregnancy and forced
sterilisation and other forms of sexual violence are each to be considered
a crime against humanity and a war crime.

The era, and bodies of knowledge around sexual violence, of women Granny
Sarah Baartman and other enslaved women's time was narrow. During this
time, the creation of the constructed symbols applying to black women
demonstrate that notions of gender, race and sexuality were limited in
overarching structures of political domination and economic exploitation.

However, the advances made by and for the women at present, with the
creation progressive international and domestic human rights laws, bear
testimony to the achievements made by women activists the world over who
articulate unacceptable forms of subjugation, exploitation and oppression.
Whilst much work is still needed to be done to ensure substantive equality
for all women at all levels, the shift from Nkoko [Granny] Sarah Baartman's
time to the present is immense.

The process illustrated by the treatment of the bodies of enslaved African
women and of women such Nkoko [Granny] Sarah Baartman encompass useful
examples of all women objectified and degraded by acts of sexual and
physical violence. Rape and other acts of overt violence that women have
experienced, such as physical assault, domestic abuse, incest and sexual
extortion further exacerbate women's subordination and oppression.

[Even if all of these have been done we still have a big task as women. The
cruelty that was done to Granny Sarah Baartman is still happening because
women as well as girls are raped at a high rate.

Poverty still prevails in the whole of Africa and people who are affected
most are women. Unemployment shows on the women's faces because they are
the ones who see to it that their families are clothed and eat properly. As
such our struggle is not yet over.

Bringing back the remains of Granny Sarah Baartman is a big achievement to
us as Africans. We appeal to all the leaders of Africa and that of our
country that at a time of their budget allocation they should ensure that
funds are directed to fighting poverty so that women should have dignity.

We have Continental Programmes. We are happy about the changing of OAU to
AU. This means that developments in Africa will have a future, but one is
worried about the low number of women in negotiations and in its running.
We are appealing to the whole leadership of Africa that we need a
satisfactory number of women to help in curbing the wars in Africa, so that
the women and children who are mostly affected, be safe.

Today we commit ourselves as women that in the name of Granny Sarah
Baartman, we will never stop fighting until all that we have mentioned is
corrected.]

We commit ourselves to ending sexual violence against women, to eradicating
poverty and systematically reducing the impact of HIV/Aids on women in our
communities. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I have three minutes, and would like to make
three remarks. Firstly, newspaper headlines read: ``The Dignity of Saartjie
Baartman Restored''. Is that really true? Yes the dignity of her memory
might have been restored, but was her person restored? She died in a
foreign country as an object of abuse; a spectacle stripped of all dignity
whatsoever. Let us not fool ourselves: Real respect for a human being and
the bestowing of real dignity cannot be backdated. Yes, it soothes the
conscience, but it does not heal the person.

Let our generation never act in a way that compels a future generation to
try to restore the dignity of those whom we have marginalised, abused and
dehumanised. Real dignity and real respect must be bestowed by our
generation to all peoples of our generation - living persons created in the
image of God.

There is a popular song with the title ``Living Years''. It is about the
regrets of a son who was too late to heal his relationship with his father.
A part of the lyrics says:


  It is too late when you die to admit we don't see eye to eye; I am sure I
  heard his echo in my baby's newborn tears; I just wish I could have told
  him in the living years.

Whether it is Saartjie Baartman, Hansie Cronje, your parents or your wife,
it is too late ``when we die''. Do it ``in the living years''.

Tweedens, ons mag nooit die vrou degradeer tot 'n blote seksobjek nie. Dít
gebeur in verhoudings, in toneelstukke, in rolprente en in gesprekke.
Vrouens mag nie gesien word as 'n kombinasie van liggaam, vlees, kurwes en
hormone nie, maar as volledige mense: hart, siel, verstand en emosies.
Seksuele verhoudings moet nie gebaseer word op blote lus nie, maar op
respek, waardering en liefde. Daarom word ons oproep om die herstel van die
waardigheid van die vrou 'n klug as ons antwoord teen HIV bloot is om
kondome uit te deel, eerder as om respek en eerbied vir die huwelik te
bevorder.

'n Debat oor die waardigheid van ons vroue word 'n klug as die raad van
Unisa besluit om die eis te betaal wat toegestaan is teen een van sy lede
weens seksuele teistering van 'n vrou. Dit word 'n klug wanneer ek as man
my vrou sien as my besitting oor wie se lewe ek die sê het. Dit word 'n
klug wanneer gesprekke onder die belt, meestal ten koste van ons vroue, die
braaivleisvure domineer.

Derdens, Saartjie Baartman is 'n simbool van gemarginaliseerd wees. Sy was
'n randfiguur van die samelewing. Die boodskap vir vandag is: Geen mens en
geen gemeenskap mag gemarginaliseer word nie. Marginalisering wanneer groot
massas in haglike omstandighede verkeer sonder die mees basiese vereistes
vir 'n menswaardige bestaan, maar ook marginalisering van die verlede, mag
nie vervang word met nuwe marginalisering nie: Marginalisering wanneer
blanke boere in Zimbabwe beskou word as tweedehandse indringers, en juis
vandag hulle plase moet ontruim ná jare se sweet en arbeid; marginalisering
wanneer in 'n nuwe Suid-Afrika, sekere gemeenskappe weer eens uitgeskuif
word na die rand van die samelewing. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Secondly, may we never degrade women to mere sex objects. This happens in
relationships, in stage plays, in films and in conversations. Women should
not be seen as a combination of body, flesh, curves and hormones, but as
complete people: heart, soul, mind and emotions. Sexual relationships must
not be based on mere desire, but on respect, appreciation and love.
Therefore our call for the restoration of the dignity of women becomes a
farce if our response to HIV is merely to hand out condoms, rather than to
promote respect and honour for marriage.

A debate on the dignity of our women becomes a farce if the council of
Unisa decides to pay the claim allowed against one of its members as a
result of sexual harassment of a woman. It becomes a farce when I as a man
view my wife as my possession over whose life I have the say. It becomes a
farce when conversations below the belt mostly at the expense of our women,
dominate the braaivleis fires.

Thirdly, Saartjie Baartman is a symbol of marginalisation. She was an
outsider in society. The message for today is: No person and no community
should be marginalised. Marginalisation in which large masses live in
desperate conditions without the most basic requirements for a dignified
existence, but also marginalisation of the past, must not be replaced with
new marginalisation: Marginalisation in which white farmers in Zimbabwe are
viewed as second-hand intruders, and have to vacate their farms precisely
today after years of sweat and toil; marginalisation in which in the new
South Africa certain communities are once again pushed out to the periphery
of society.]

My message is: Every person is valuable and dignified. Every community is
valuable. Let us live out and bestow real human dignity in every sphere of
life ``in the living years''.

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, daar was baie emosiebelaaide debatte
die afgelope aantal weke rakende Saartjie, of Sarah, Baartman. Niemand kan
ontken dat die pyn en die hartseer van hierdie vrou, en wat sy moes
deurmaak, ons opnuut aan die hart gegryp het nie.

Daar is ook by tye egter balans verloor deur kenners en woordvoerders met
verskillende agendas, wat mekaar duidelik met uitsprake probeer oortref het
om die oog te vang. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speaker, there have been numerous emotional debates
over the past weeks in respect to Saartjie, or Sarah, Baartman. No one can
deny that the pain and the sorrow of this woman, and what she had to
endure, have once again touched our hearts.

At times, however, balance has been lost by experts and spokespersons with
different agendas, who clearly attempted to outdo one another with their
statements in order to be noticed.]

Dr Cyril Hromnik, an expert on the early history of Southern Africa, in an
article, ``A Place called Paradise'' says:


  While true history is a source of inspiration and confidence, it is also
  true that a history that is muddled-up is a source of confusion.

Daarom is dit vir my persoonlik belangrik dat daar ook 'n ander dimensie op
die debat rakende hierdie vrou, wat soveel pyn verduur het, en haar
mensegroep geplaas word. ``Saartjie Baartman is die grootmoeder van ons
almal'', het iemand onlangs gesê. Ek het groot simpatie met Saartjie se
verlede, maar ons verlede strek veel verder as Saartjie self terug. Iemand
anders het haar die mees geëksploiteerde en vernederde vrou ooit in Afrika
genoem - asof die verhaal van elke vrou uit Afrika deur al die eeue heen
aan ons bekend is.

Is ons seker dat haar regte naam Saartjie, of Sarah, Baartman was, of dra
ons by tot die miskenning van haar ware identiteit deur haar Sarah of
Saartjie te noem? Krotoa het hulle immers ``Eva'' genoem, en Autsumao het
hulle ``Harry die standloper'' genoem. Tussen al hierdie uitsprake deur het
provinsies tougetrek oor waar sy eintlik hoort, asof haar geboorte- en
leefwêreld begrens en in provinsies afgebaken was.

Die feit dat die oorblyfsels van Saartjie Baartman, of wie sy ook al was,
môre in die Gamtoosvallei onder groot belangstelling begrawe sal word, het
ten minste een tergende vraag begin beantwoord ten opsigte van hierdie
vrou, en ten opsigte van elkeen van ons wat op een of ander wyse aan
hierdie inheemse groep verbind word. Saartjie Baartman het behoort, en om
te behoort is 'n integrale deel van haar waardigheid, en van elkeen van ons
s'n. Dit is deel van ons identiteit. Dit is deel van ons menswees.

As ons wil bou aan die identiteit en die waardigheid van enige individu,
enige gemeenskap, enige mensegroep, dan is dit belangrik dat daar feitelike
substansie hieraan gegee word. Historici, argeoloë, paleontoloë, kenners en
almal van ons wat deur feitelike substansie geaffekteer sal word, behoort
te help dat duidelikheid gebring word, want enige persoon, gemeenskap of
mensegroep wat onseker is oor sy histories gefundeerde verlede, sal in 'n
see van konflikterende spekulering na enige boei gryp om voort te drywe na
'n onsekere en 'n vae toekoms. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Therefore, it is of personal importance for me that there should also be
another dimension to the debate with regard to this woman, who endured so
much pain, and her race. ``Saartjie Baartman is the grandmother of us
all'', someone remarked recently. I have great sympathy for Saartjie's
past, but our past stretches back much further than Saartjie herself.
Someone else called her the most exploited and degraded woman ever in
Africa - as if the story of every woman from Africa throughout the ages
were known to us.

Are we certain that her real name was Saartjie, or Sarah, Baartman, or are
we contributing to the disregard of her true identity by calling her Sarah
or Saartjie? After all, they named Krotoa ``Eva'', and Autsumao they named
``Harry the Strandloper''. Among all these statements the provinces took
part in a tug of war as to where she in fact belonged, as if the realm of
her birth and existence were surrounded by a border and demarcated in
provinces.

The fact that the remains of Saartjie Baartman, or whoever she was, will be
buried in the Gamtoos Valley tomorrow amid much interest, has at least
begun to answer one challenging question with regard to this woman and with
regard to every one of us who is in one way or another connected to this
indigenous group. Saartjie Baartman belonged - and to belong is an integral
part of her dignity and the dignity of every one of us. It is part of our
identity. It is part of our humanity.

If we want to develop the identity and the dignity of any individual, any
community, any race, then it is important that factual substance is given
to this. Historians, archaeologists, paleontologists, experts and all of us
who may be affected by factual substance should assist in ensuring that
clarity is brought forth, because every person, community or race that is
unsure of its historically based past will grab at any life buoy in a sea
of conflicting speculation in order to drift to an uncertain and distant
future.]

What shall we call her? A Khoi woman? If Khoi means ``man'', does it imply
that she was a man-woman? Or shall we call her a San woman? If San means
``naked'', does it imply that she was a naked woman? Or shall we refer to
her as a Khoisan woman, as some prefer?

Of was sy dalk 'n Quena-vrou? Quena verwys onder andere na 'n spesifieke
godsdiens wat beoefen is, en wat noue bande gehad het met Oosterse gelowe.
Dit lewer bewys dat kontak met handelaars uit Indië reeds eeue aan die gang
was, lank voordat die Portugese en die Hollanders op die toneel verskyn
het. Die heilige plekke waar die Quena aanbid het, is steeds sigbaar in
groot dele van Suid-Afrika. Kenners wys op die duidelike ooreenkomste met
Oosterse gelowe en Stonehenge in Engeland. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Or was she perhaps a Quena woman? Quena refers, inter alia, to a specific
religion that was practised, and that was closely connected to Eastern
religions. This provides evidence that contact with merchants from India
had already been ongoing for centuries, long before the Portuguese and the
Dutch arrived on the scene. The holy places where the Quena worshipped are
still visible in large parts of South Africa. Experts highlight the
significant similarities to Eastern religions and Stonehenge in England.]

Is the name ``autentotoe'' synonomous with the name ``hottentot''.
``Autentotoe'' means ``we are related'', and was used in communication with
strangers when trading took place. ``Autentotoe'' is a name that was later
corrupted by early Europeans into the well-known and later abrasively used
name ``Hottentot''.

Hierdie is die begin van indringende vrae wat nou gevra moet word. Die
mensegroep waaraan Sarah behoort het, en waarvan ek deel is, maak aanspraak
op eerste-nasie status en alles wat daarmee gepaard gaan. Daar is verkose
hoofmanne en -vroue van verskillende stamme wat saamgestel is uit mense wat
soek na hulle gister, die Atakwas, die Gonokwas, die Inkwas, die Gorikwas
en andere wat daarop aanspraak maak dat daar vir hulle voorsiening in die
Grondwet gemaak moet word, met alles wat daarmee gepaard gaan. Indien
hierdie aansprake net op emosie gegrond is, en nie histories gefundeer kan
word nie, sal enige aanspraak op regsgronde verwerp kan word, en saam met
die verwerping van ons aansprake sal ons toekoms, ons identiteit en ons
waardigheid verwerp word.

Die Regering moet dringend bydra dat hierdie fundamentele deel van die
geskiedenis van ons land die regmatige plek en erkenning kry wat dit
verdien. Ons moet duidelikheid kry oor ons verlede sodat die lig helder kan
skyn op ons toekoms. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This marks the beginning of some incisive questions that must now be
asked. The race to which Sarah belonged, and of which I am part, lays claim
to first-nation status and everything associated with that. There are
elected chiefs, both men and women, from several clans which comprise
people searching for their yesterday: the Atakwas, the Gonokwas, the
Inkwas, the Gorikwas, and others who claim that provision should be made
for them in the Constitution, together with everything associated with
that. If these claims are based only on emotion and have no historical
basis, any claim will be rejected on legal grounds and, together with the
rejection of our claims, our future, our identity and our dignity will be
rejected.

The Government must urgently see to it that this fundamental part of the
history of our country receives the rightful place and recognition that it
deserves. We must have clarity with regard to our past in order for the
light to shine brightly on our future.]

Prof H NGUBANE: Madam Speaker and colleagues, our national Women's Day
tomorrow will be uniquely celebrated by an event which arouses in most of
us contradictory feelings; feelings of joy, as well as of pain. It is only
a pity that she will be buried under the name of Sarah Baartman; a name
that was a mark of subordination and humiliation. If we consider that it
was her physical appearance which put her in such a humiliating situation,
we should stop and think about who we ourselves are in Southern Africa.
Most of us as women in South Africa have wide bums, wide hips and padded
backs. We should not be ashamed of that.

In order to honour Sarah Baartman we should see to it that the designers -
those with dresses for women in their shops - have dresses that are made to
suit African woman. [Applause.] We should not be ashamed of who we are. We
should be proud and hold our heads up high, because there is a reason for
our being what we are. The prejudices which affected Sarah Baartmann still
exist - even today. Our young girls, when they enter a beauty competition,
will be rejected because they have wide hips and they are not slim.
[Applause.] Hardly any designers cater for us and in the end we are
brainwashed by constantly being shown beautiful pictures of women in
magazines that reflect figures of women in the dominant culture. Sarah
Baartmann's story should actually make us think seriously of who we are in
South Africa and Southern Africa, and about how these things still happen,
but in a clever way, one which is not so obvious.

The point that I want to focus on, which is the leading theme of this
debate, is reclaiming the dignity and the rights of African women. The very
topic implies that there is something to be reclaimed, that there is
something which has been lost by African women. We need to look at those
things even in day-to-day communication among ourselves, and see what was
there that was good and is now being eroded. For instance, today people
sing the song: ``Igama lamakhosikazi malibongwe.'' [The women's name should
be praised.] The very term ``inkosikazi'' [a woman] is elevating a woman
because a suffix is added to ``inkosi'' [a king] and a woman is now a great
``inkosi'' [king] and various other words like that are used to refer to
women: ``inkosazana'' [maiden], ``indodakazi'' [daughter] and others like
them. All these things were meant to enhance the dignity of women. What is
spoken goes with the conceptual value and morality of a society.

The instance of the erosion of the dignity of African women is also visible
in the context of marriage. As we all know, on marriage in Africa,
especially Southern Africa, women never changed their names. They retained
their names and they held the status of a mother, while the man held the
status of a father, which made them partners in parenting. At the same
time, however, the woman had her domain, the domestic domain, where she had
all sorts of control over that domain in the agrarian culture. Hon members
can imagine that the women had control of all crop-yielding land, while the
man had control of the livestock land. All this balance meant that women
were not dependent on men, but that there were checks and balances which
saw to it that there was equity in the gender relationship. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker and hon members, let me start by saying:
``Malibongwe! [Let it be praised!] [Interjections.] Malibongwe! [Let it be
praised!] [Interjections.]

Sarah Baartman is uit die Kaap weggelok onder voorwendsels dat sy 'n goeie
werk sou kon kry, baie geld sou kon verdien en natuurlik 'n lekker
gemaklike lewe sou lei. Dit was nie so nie en sy het eerder 'n lewe van
hel, pyn en vernedering ervaar.

Jong meisies word net so van die platteland gelok om in die stede te kom
werk. Hulle beland dan hier onder die indruk dat hul lewens aansienlik gaan
verbeter. In baie gevalle moet hulle dan met die onmenslikste omstandighede
tevrede wees. Hulle slaap in motorhuise, werk ongoddelike ure in die huis
en by die winkel, en dan moet hulle vanaand nog kinders oppas wanneer die
baas en die miesies hul vriende oornooi vir 'n geselligheidjie. Hulle kan
nie naweke uitgaan nie, kry nooit af nie, kry slegter kos as die hond en
verdien minder geld as wat belowe is.

'n Ander aspek is dat hierdie dames mense met behoeftes is. Hulle gaan mans
ontmoet, verhoudings aanknoop en soms erg mishandel word. Dan is daar
diegene wat besluit, of soms gedwing word, om as prostitute te werk om geld
te verdien. Dit is dikwels as gevolg van ekonomiese omstandighede, asook
van pure manipulering deur mans wat bloot die teergevoeligheid van vroue
uitbuit. Selfs op plekke waar die swak ekonomiese omstandighede 'n
geweldige negatiewe impak het op die sosiale vesel van ons gemeenskappe, is
uitbuiting, mishandeling en geweld teen vroue en kinders aan die orde van
die dag.

Ons ken natuurlik die voorbeeld van baba Tshepang in Louisvale. Ek is baie
dankbaar daar geskied reg in ons regstelsel en dat David Potse - ons neem
aan hy was die kind se pa - lewenslank tronk toe gestuur is vir hierdie
onmenslike daad.

Verder wil ons ook 'n sterk waarskuwing aan pa's rig. Dit is altyd elke
ouer, en in die besonder die pa, se plig om die kinders en die huisgesin te
beskerm en net die beste vir hulle te gee. Dit is die onmenslikste ding
wanneer 'n kind, wat haar hele lewe aan haar vader toevertrou, deur hom
verkrag en onsedelik aangerand word. Ons spreek ons simpatie uit met alle
vroue en kinders wat op die walglikste en onmenslikste maniere verkrag en
onsedelik aangerand word, en wat deesdae in die meeste gevalle ook wreed
vermoor word.

So ook gaan my simpatie uit na die ouers van Edwina Booysen, 'n
vyftienjarige dogter van Atlantis wat vermis geraak het nadat sy en haar 30-
jarige vriendin gaan stap het. Hulle is deur vier mans gegryp en die bosse
ingesleep. Edwina se vriendin was gelukkig om te ontsnap, maar sy was nie
en het op die wreedste moontlike manier met haar lewe geboet. Sy is verkrag
en met meer as 300 meswonde in 'n vlak graf begrawe. Daar word beweer dat
sy in daardie stadium nog kon gelewe het. 'n Kind van baie eenvoudige
ouers, maar met 'n blink toekoms, is deur 'n spul walglike barbare verhoed
om haar ideale te verwesenlik.

Ek wil ook die mense, en veral die vroue, van Atlantis, Mamre, Pella,
Witsand en ander gebiede in die Weskaap en die res van ons land prys vir
die manier waarop hulle baklei om die skuldiges wat hierdie dade pleeg
agter tralies te probeer kry. Geen man het die reg om vroue te verkrag nie.
Hulle moet ook nie met die twak verskoning kom dat die dade gepleeg word as
gevolg van die uitlokkende kleredrag van vrouens nie. Dit is onaanvaarbaar.

Ek is ook baie trots op die mans wat onlangs aan die ``Men's March''
deelgeneem het met die boodskap, ``Real men don't rape''. Dit beteken dat
die uitbuiting, vernedering en slegte behandeling waaraan Sarah Baartman
200 jaar gelede blootgestel is, vandag steeds voortduur onder haar
nakomelinge. Dit kan nie, dit mag nie, moet nie en dit durf nie meer geduld
word nie.

Terwyl ons dus gereedmaak vir die teraardebestellling van haar oorskot
môre, op Vrouedag, moet ons ook dink aan die voortgesette ontmensliking van
die Sarah Baartmans van vandag.

Vroue gaan nog baie gebuk onder groot diskriminasie in ons samelewing. Op
die fabrieksvloer verdien vroue steeds minder as mans en het hulle baie
minder voordele as mans. By sekere werksplekke is daar vroue wat nie eens
afkry om vir 'n eenvoudige papsmeer te gaan nie. Op ander plekke word vroue
se swangerskap nie eens erken nie. Dit is ook so dat veral die swart vroue
wat die meeste swaarkry juis enkelouers is wat boonop werkloos is.

Ek rig 'n ernstige versoek aan die Departement van Welsyn om al die
probleme met die uitbetaling van toelaes vir vroue en kinders so gou as
moontlik uit die weg te ruim. Ek weet nie of agb lede al by die
uitbetaalpunte was nie, maar die grootste vernedering is die tipe taal
waarin vroue toegesnou word wanneer hulle daar staan en wag vir die toelaes
om uitbetaal te word, maar hul name is nie daar nie en hulle wil dit nie
aanvaar nie. Dit moet asseblief end kry. Die departement moet verder sy
amptenare opvoed om hierdie mense beter te behandel. Hierdie mense is nie
daar om te bedel nie. Hulle gaan daarheen om 'n toelae te ontvang waarop
hulle geregtig is. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Sarah Baartman was lured away from the Cape on the pretext that she would
get a good job, could earn lots of money and would obviously lead an easy
life. This was not the case and she experienced a life of hell, pain and
humiliation.

In the same way young girls are lured from the rural areas to come and work
in the cities. They end up here under the impression that their lives would
improve considerably. In many cases they have to be satisfied with the most
inhuman circumstances. They sleep in garages, work ungodly hours in the
house and at the shop, and then in the evenings they still have to look
after children when the boss and the madam invite their friends over for a
get-together. They cannot go out over weekends, never get time off, receive
worse food than the dog and less money than what they were promised.

Another aspect is that these ladies are people with needs. They are going
to meet men and have relationships and sometimes even be badly abused. Then
there are those who decide, or are sometimes forced, to work as prostitutes
in order to earn money. This is often as a result of economic
circumstances, as well as of pure manipulation by men who merely exploit
the sensitivity of women. Even at places where poor economic circumstances
have a severely negative impact on the social fabric of our society,
exploitation, abuse and violence against women and children is the order of
the day.

We of course know the example of baby Tshepang in Louisvale. I am very
grateful that justice is prevailing in our justice system and that David
Potse - we assume that he is the father of the child - will receive a
lifelong prison sentence for this inhuman deed.

We would furthermore also like to issue a strong warning to fathers. It is
always every parent's duty, and in particular that of the father, to
protect his children and family and only give them the very best. It is the
most inhuman thing when a child, who trusts her father with her life, is
raped and indecently assaulted by him. We express our sympathy to those
women and children who are raped and indecently assaulted in the most
repulsive and inhuman manner, and who, these days, are also murdered in
most cases in the most brutal manner.

So also my sympathy goes to the parents of Edwina Booysen, a fifteen-year-
old daughter of Atlantis who went missing after she and her thirty-year-old
girlfriend went for a walk. They were grabbed by four men and were dragged
into the bushes. Edwina's friend was lucky enough to escape, but she was
not and paid with her life in the most brutal manner possible. She was
raped and was buried in a shallow grave with more than 300 knife wounds. It
is alleged that at that stage she might still have been alive. A child of
very simple parents, but with a bright future, was prevented from realising
her ideals by a bunch of vile barbarians.

I also want to praise all the people, and especially the women from
Atlantis, Mamre, Pella, Witsand and other areas in the Western Cape and the
rest of our country for the manner in which they are fighting to get the
perpetrators of these deeds behind bars. No man has the right to rape any
woman. They should also not come with their stupid excuse that these crimes
are committed as a result of the provocative clothing of these women. This
is unacceptable.

I am also very proud of the men who recently participated in the men's
march with the message ``Real men don't rape''. This means that the
exploitation, humiliation and bad treatment to which Sarah Baartman was
exposed to 200 years ago is still continuing today amongst her descendants.
This cannot, should not, may not and dare not be tolerated any longer.

While we are getting ourselves ready for the burial of her remains
tomorrow, on Women's Day, we should also think of the continued
dehumanisation of the Sarah Baartmans of today.

Women still suffer a lot under major discrimination in our society. On the
factory floor women still earn less than men and have much fewer benefits
than men. At certain places of work there are women who do not even get off
to go for a simple papsmear. At other places women's pregnancies are not
even recognised. It is also a fact that especially black women who struggle
the most are, in fact, single parents who are also unemployed.

I am making an earnest appeal to the Department of Welfare to deal with all
the problems regarding the payouts of grants for women and children, as
soon as possible. I do not know whether hon members have been to these
payout points, but the biggest humiliation is the type of language in which
these women are snarled at when they stand there and wait for the grants to
be paid out, but their names are not there and they do not want to accept
this. This should please come to an end. The department should further
educate its officials to treat these people better. These people are not
there to beg. They go there to receive a grant to which they are entitled.]

On a more positive note, although a lot needs to be done, women are taking
control of their lives. On the political front South Africa boasts the
largest number of female Cabinet Ministers and more than 25% of its members
of Parliament are women. Of course, 30% of the ANC's members are women.
That is, of course, the example.

On the economic front we should seriously consider the shockingly low
participation of women in the economy. In the private and public sectors
black women, meaning African, Coloured and Indian, are still positioned at
the extreme low end of management structures. We hope that the Government
will soon be able to evaluate the country's employment equity policies, so
that the law can be enforced more harshly if there is an insufficient
improvement in these figures.

In the Western Cape we have an outstanding role model in the form of Zulfah
Alli, who successfully tendered for a building contract worth an
unprecedented R7,2 million. She had to overcome lots of obstacles and, at
times, insults to get this particular contract. It was only when she wrote
to President Mbeki and also took a complaint to the Western Cape Racism
Conference early last year, that her problems with the DA and the Western
Cape government came to light. She was threatened with legal action and the
withdrawal of her tender, but she continued this fight. In the Western Cape
there was a law called the Preferential Procurement Act, whereby they would
only give black empowerment companies contracts with a ceiling of R2
million. Well done, Zulfah, that is the spirit of women.

We also sing praise to Natalie du Toit, who is not only an outstanding
athlete, but who is also disabled. She has won the highest honour for the
people of South Africa with her outstanding achievement at the Commonwealth
Games. [Applause.]

Ons sing 'n loflied aan 'n maatskappy in Atlantis, naamlik Atlantis Forge,
wat gestremde vroue in diens het wat hoogs tegnologiese masjiene bedien en
wat produksie van uitstaande kwaliteit lewer vir maatskappye soos Daimler-
Chrysler, BMW en Volkswagen. Na ek verneem beoog dié maatskappy dat
ongeveer 5% van sy poste uiteindelik deur liggaamlik gestremdes gevul sal
word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[We sing a song of praise to a company in Atlantis, namely Atlantis Forge,
where disabled women are employed who service highly technological machines
and who deliver products of outstanding quality for companies such as
Daimler-Chrysler, BMW and Volkswagen. After I enquired, this company
eventually aims to fill approximately 5% of its post with disabled people.]

We sing praise to all of those women in our country who have been abused,
raped, indecently assaulted and discriminated against, but who have stood
up to fight for their rights and have ensured that the perpetrators of
these deeds were successfully put behind bars.

The fight for the emancipation of women in our country and in the world
still has a long way to go. However, we men can help to shorten this
particular fight. The sooner we realise that women are our equals and not
just the bearers of our children, who must also prepare our food, the
sooner we can be a successful society, a successful country and a
successful world. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Education on Visits to
     Institutions of Higher Learning, dated 6 November 2001:


       The Portfolio Committee on Education, having sent delegations to
       institutions of higher learning in May and August 2001, reports as
       follows:


     A.     Objective of visits


         In a meeting on 28 February 2001, the Committee unanimously agreed
         that delegations undertake provincial visits to institutions of
         higher learning to assess the rate at which transformation was
         taking place and to give special attention to the following
         issues:


         1. Implementation of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme
             (NSFAS), to ensure that access by the poorest of the poor to
              higher education is improved.


         2. Adaptation of entry requirements, bridging programmes and the
              manner in which entrance requirements are made public to all
              people, irrespective of language and cultural background.


         3. How much the tradition and ethos of the institutions have
              adapted to new ethnically and culturally integrated student
              bodies, so that all students form an integral part of these
              institutions.


         4. How much institutions have adapted their curricula to ensure
              appropriate output to satisfy the country's goals of economic
              renewal.


     B.     Delegations


         1. Peninsula Technikon


              The delegation was under the leadership of the Committee
              chairperson, Prof S M Mayatula (ANC), and included Dr J
              Benjamin (ANC), Ms D G Nhlengethwa (ANC), Ms E Gandhi (ANC),
              Mr R P Z van den Heever (ANC), Prof S S Ripinga (ANC), Mr S J
              Mohai (ANC), Mr K Moonsamy (ANC), Ms N C Manjezi (Committee
              Secretary) and Ms N Borotho (Committee Assistant).


         2. University of Fort Hare, University of Transkei and University
              of Natal


              The delegation, under the leadership of the Committee
              chairperson, Prof S M Mayatula (ANC), included Mrs M A A Njobe
              (ANC), Ms E Gandhi (ANC), Mr A M Mpontshane (IFP), Dr B L
              Geldenhuys (New NP), Ms N C Manjezi (Committee Secretary), Ms
              N Borotho (Committee Assistant) and Mr B Ntsong (Departmental
              Official).


              Prof L M Mbadi from the UDM joined the delegation at the
              University of Transkei.


         3. Wits University, Potchefstroom University and University of the
              North


              The delegation, under the leadership of Ms P K Mothoagae
              (ANC), included Mr S B Ntuli (ANC), Ms P N Mnandi (ANC), Mr R
              S Ntuli (DP), Mr C Aucamp (AEB), Ms A Jojozi (Committee
              Secretary), Ms D Martin (Committee Assistant) and Mr M Mampuru
              (Departmental Official).


              Mr L I Maphoto (ANC) joined the delegation at the University
              of the North.


     C.     Peninsula Technikon - 22 May 2001


         1. Official view by Prof B Figaji, Vice-Chancellor


              On arrival at the Peninsula Technikon, the delegation was
              warmly welcomed by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof B Figaji, and the
              Management Board.


              At the Technikon, they focus on providing an environment
              conducive to learning and on programmes that promote academic
              success for those serious about using the opportunity to
              obtain a tertiary qualification. The institution takes pride
              in providing for the holistic development of students -
              academically, spiritually, physically and culturally. Students
              are provided with technological education that prepares them
              for the world of work through experiential programmes.


              The Senate deals with academic staff. The Student
              Representative Council (SRC) runs its own budget and meets
              with the Management Board on a six-weekly basis. There are
              good students and a very supportive staff.


              At the time of the visit, they were building the R26 million
              Information Technology Centre, with 1 450 computers. They
              needed more funding to complete the project.


              The Technikon shall be a centre of excellence for career
              education, to be recognised by the community, commerce and
              industry, as well as the public sector, as being responsive to
              the needs of society. It will be non-racial, non-sexist and
              democratic.


         2. Implementation of National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS)
              - official view by Mr G Reynecke, Head: Financial Aid, and Mr
              T Titus, Head: Student Affairs


              The Technikon has historically served a student population
              coming from socially, educationally and economically
              disadvantaged backgrounds. Providing financial aid to students
              to ensure access of the poor to higher education has always
              been a priority. It is important to ensure sustained support
              to such students during their academic life. The scheme
              administers all financial aid - institutional funds from
              donors, nominated awards and work study programmes.


              (a) Processes and procedures


                  Institutional policies governing the distribution of
                  financial assistance is developed and reviewed by the
                  Financial Aid Committee and the Financial Aid Forum. The
                  committee consists of academics, support services and
                  student leadership. The forum is a working committee
                  representative of staff in the Financial Aid Office and
                  the SRC. The input of students is canvassed through the
                  forum to review, develop and implement policies governing
                  the distribution of NSFAS funds. The forum has regular
                  meetings to focus on the implementation of criteria
                  developed and the assessment of appeals from student
                  applications on matters related to the allocations of
                  NSFAS funds.
                  Students are involved in all committees in the
                  institution and participate fully in them. The Technikon
                  at all times ensures the sustainability of the system.


              (b) Criteria


                  Key elements in the selection of students are academic
                  ability or potential and financial need. These elements
                  are guided by an NSFAS policy document. Students are
                  expected to pass at least 50% of their courses in order
                  to qualify. They are also allowed one year longer than
                  the prescribed minimum duration to qualify.


                  Financial need is broadly based on the income of the
                  household and the number of dependants. Students or their
                  families are generally expected to contribute towards
                  their study costs, with the poorest making the smallest
                  or no contribution at all. A maximum amount of household
                  income is determined annually. Upon registration, a
                  student must pay R940 upfront (this increases the next
                  year). Only registered students are allocated money from
                  the scheme.


              (c) Costing of awards


                  The method of determining the size of awards is based on
                  the NSFAS guideline: Study cost minus own contribution
                  minus other awards equals NSFAS award. Study cost is made
                  up of tuition fees, accommodation and meals (or private
                  boarding) and books. As 60% of the students are from
                  rural areas, there are systems to assist them.


              (d) Application and selection process


                  Senior students apply during October/November. Once data
                  is captured on the mainframe computer, selection is done
                  as soon as possible after registration, usually during
                  March. Upon completion of the required contracts,
                  selected students are assisted by means of access to
                  meals, books, photocopies and study material, even though
                  it takes a while before funds are transferred to the
                  institution.


                  First-year students apply during registration. Selection
                  is done during May/June. The same process for senior
                  students applies to them upon receipt of completed
                  contract forms required. Only registered students can
                  access the funding.


                  The selection process is systems-driven. Initial
                  screening assesses basic academic ability and financial
                  need of applicants. Further manual assessments are done
                  to ensure that students have been treated fairly. All the
                  processes and procedures are progressive, democratic and
                  transparent.


              (e) NSFAS allocations


                  1997 - 2 138; 1998 - 3 020; 1999 - 2 396; 2000 - 3 199.


              (f) Challenges and positive aspects


                  A challenge shared with the SRC and other student bodies
                  is to limit the abuse of funding on the one hand and on
                  the other to congratulate the government for introducing
                  this.


         3. Entry requirements, student development and integrated language
              development - official view by Ms C Jacobs, Language Co-
              ordinator, and Mr L Himunchul


              Peninsula Technikon is a higher education institution and the
              standard requirement is a matriculation certificate. It also
              has a Recognition of Prior Learning policy that facilitates
              access of mature students who do not meet the formal entry
              requirements, but bring a wealth of learning acquired via
              experience in the workplace and other learning environments.


              The institution has also been involved in alternative
              admission processes like Headstart and Access Programme. These
              initiatives aim at preparing students for higher education by
              providing foundation work in areas like mathematics and
              science. Access Programme was also a vehicle for training and
              education of returning cadres in the early 1990s, to enable
              their reintegration into post-apartheid South Africa.


              They do not have any bridging/foundation programmes.
              Compensatory programmes are integrated into the academic
              offering of departments. All departments have one or more of
              the following programmes: supplementary instruction/tutorial
              support; laboratory/practical assistants; language development
              tutorials; and academic consultation.


              The effectiveness of peer collaborative learning has been well
              researched and documented. Early theories - Dewy, Piaget and
              Bruner - provided clear direction that led to the much valued
              peer collaborative learning. Developmental psychologists
              carried on the early research, and recent research in college
              student development and retention lent further empirical
              support.


              The fact that only 24% of the students have English as their
              first language, presents a teaching and learning challenge for
              educators. Experience has shown that the only way to improve
              the success rate, is to recognise and confront the issue of
              language. Unfortunately, there is no easy or rapid, yet
              effective, remedial programme to correct the extent of the
              linguistic disadvantage the majority of students experience
              when they enter higher education. The Technikon has adopted a
              short-term support strategy for students and a longer-term
              change strategy for staff. These strategies are implemented
              together, but the two sets of outcomes are measured
              independently.


              (a) Purpose of short-term strategy for students


                  The purpose is to improve their language skills by
                  providing structured tutorials, offering computer-aided
                  language learning courses, establishing and supporting
                  peer study groups and providing more student-centred
                  learning material.


              (b) Purpose of long-term change strategy for staff


                  The purpose is to involve lecturers, through capacity-
                  building training programmes and material development
                  projects, to consciously think about how they teach,
                  about the appropriateness of the material they use and
                  about the need to consider the linguistic ability of
                  their learners.


                  The US has donated R1 million for student support and
                  staff development initiatives.


         4. Curriculum change - official view by Prof H Fransman, Director:
              Educational Development Centre


              The Technikon commits itself to develop academically, socially
              and technologically competent students, who are responsive to
              the broader need of society, by:


              *   Promoting an environment conducive to human development
              *   Facilitating appropriate tuition, co-operative education
                  and support according to the academic needs of the
                  students


              *   Encouraging staff commitment to quality education and
                  service


              *   Offering programmes for educationally disadvantaged
                  students


              *   Fostering lifelong learning.


              The centre is intimately involved in providing support to
              teaching staff so that their efforts may lead to elevating the
              quality of student learning. Part of the support is given
              through intensive research into student learning. Research has
              shown that at school students learn too much detail, they have
              no time to think. The Technikon want to see students use their
              analytical ability more often. It was emphasised that students
              should become more concerned with the nature of evidence on
              which they base an argument.


              Students learn a multitude of techniques in the different
              disciplines. These techniques are used to solve problems
              related to the discipline and the industry. Very often
              students do not question these techniques, as they believe
              that the lecturer is right. In the early stage of their career
              in higher education, students treat staff as the ultimate
              authority from whom they expect the answers. In order to cope
              with the workload, surface approaches to learning are adopted,
              i.e. the memorising of facts. The other issue is: HOW did the
              lecturer engage with the students and the learning material?


              The new approach to curriculum development via outcomes,
              modularisation and continuous assessment, hopes to alleviate
              some of these problems. It was found by the centre that
              students preferred teachers with a similar cognitive style as
              their own. For example, students who are very dependent on the
              lecturer, would require more structural support provided by
              articulated forms of teaching. If the lecturer has not been
              able to determine the extent to which students are dependent,
              he/she will not know how to adapt the teaching.


              The centre does research on student learning as an extension
              of previous research in an attempt to discover in greater
              detail what students' conceptions of learning are. While many
              students study, especially during examination or test time,
              very few learn. Areas to be covered, are:


              What does learning mean to the student? What are their
              preferences for different courses? What are their preferences
              for different styles of learning (e.g. a holistic style, a
              serialist style, a deep approach, a surface approach or
              strategic approach to learning)?


              The research is based on work done in the UK, Sweden, Denmark
              and the USA, and it has also been extended to the Technikon
              Northern Gauteng, the Eastern Cape Technikon and M L Sultan
              Technikon. The findings of the research will inform their
              curriculum development processes and the manner in which the
              Technikon teach.


         5. Curriculum development - official view by Mr J Garraway


              The curriculum development process has involved changing
              teaching in step with government policy. According to the
              National Plan for Higher Education (2001:9), one of the
              challenges facing higher education is the "mobilisation of
              human talent and potential through life-long learning to
              contribute to social, economic, cultural and intellectual life
              of a rapidly changing society". This is to be done through
              improving teaching programmes so as to produce students with
              critical competencies necessary to function in modern society,
              students who are information- and computer-literate, who are
              effective communicators, who possess analytical, problem-
              solving and knowledge reconfiguration skills, and who are team
              builders and networkers with negotiating skills. Overarching
              these developments are the policies of redress and equity
              outlined in the White Paper on Higher Education of 1997.


              The Technikon has set about responding to the challenges laid
              down by the Department by changing teaching in the following
              two ways:


              (a) Designing an outcomes-based curriculum


                  In 1999 technikons submitted outcomes-based, rather than
                  subject-based, qualifications to SAQA for interim
                  registration. This was a joint effort by all technikons.
                  During 2000 lecturers in every Peninsula Technikon
                  department worked on these qualification outcomes, as
                  follows:


                  They broke the qualification outcomes down into smaller
                  outcomes more specific to teaching and learning, in that
                  they reflected the Technikon's particular teaching and
                  learning fields of expertise. They then included the
                  above critical competencies in the wording of the
                  outcomes.


                  The lecturers added outcomes which reflected passing
                  judgement on actions and changing behaviour to adapt to
                  new circumstances.


                  The outcomes were levelled so as to reflect the stage of
                  learning of the learner.


              (b) Designing integrated assessments


                  In 2001 lecturers began designing integrated projects so
                  that learners could achieve the outcomes described above.
                  These projects were characterised as workplace simulation
                  activities, integrated across subjects and involving
                  critical competencies. Projects were criterion-
                  referenced, meaning that what lecturers were looking for
                  in an ideal answer, including the critical competencies,
                  was made clear to learners before they started the
                  project. Furthermore, learners were expected to assess
                  and monitor their progress in the project against the
                  criteria as a method of encouraging life-long learning.


                  All programmes have advisory committees on course
                  content. Most students are given the opportunity to look
                  for jobs.


                  According to the President of the SRC, Mr T Damoyi, there
                  are in-service training programmes for students. The
                  academic board reviews programmes offered so as to update
                  the curriculum.


         6. Student development - official view by Mr E Sebokedi, Deputy
              Head: Student Affairs


              A major challenge for the leadership development and student
              governance support segment was to develop capacity to train
              student leadership in accordance with identified needs, whilst
              at the same time continuing to provide support to student
              structures. Within the context of limited resources, they
              offer students leadership development programmes and give
              support to structures on campus.


              The operation of the leadership development and student
              governance support segment was translated into key performance
              areas and key performance indicators.
              The KPAs and KPIs for the SRC Administration office (Student
              Governance Support) were never finalised.


              (a) Areas identified as scope of work


                  *    Dealing with general student enquiries (providing
                       information and referrals)


                  *    Typing correspondence and reports for the SRC and
                       student structures


                  *    Mailing and registering correspondence, reception of
                       calls and messaging


                  *    Other related matters.


              (b) Student leadership training and evaluation
                  The office organised 17 workshops during the year under
                  review. The total number of participants in training
                  workshops during the year was 510. The target groups for
                  the workshop were divided into two cohorts, namely
                  elected student leaders and non-elected leaders. The
                  participants evaluated four workshops, namely those held
                  for class representatives (Faculty Councils) and house
                  committee members (Central Residence Committee).


                  The workshops conducted during the period of review
                  partially met the two objectives:


                  *    To facilitate learning about the roles and
                       responsibilities of elected student leaders


                  *    To train students in problem-solving skills.


                  The focus areas of problem-solving and systems
                  orientation were adequately met.


              (c) Leadership consultations


                  Over the past five years, an open-door policy for student
                  leaders wishing to consult on a range of
                  problems/challenges, was established. The general
                  approach is to listen to the problem statement, to ask
                  questions of clarification and to suggest possible
                  options to deal with the matter at hand. It is
                  consistently communicated to student leaders that it is
                  their responsibility to take decisions and act upon them.


                  To accurately account for the impact of such
                  consultations, presented a problem. It was therefore
                  decided to get more accurate data on such consultations.
                  The practice of recording data was not consistently
                  followed during the period under review. The consultation
                  focus areas were: 41% workshop planning; 17% enterprise
                  opportunities; 41% project conceptualisation; and 17%
                  others.


              (d) Institutional promotion and student development


                  This office is currently engaged in three initiatives to
                  promote student development:


                  *    Drafting an institutional development plan


                  *    Co-ordinating the first-year orientation forum


                  *    Contributing to the establishment of a new IT
                       Centre.


                  These activities relate to the department's objective of
                  maximising resources for skills development on campus.


                  On drafting the student development plan, the student
                  affairs division complements the concerted efforts for
                  both students and staff.


     D.     University of Fort Hare - 6 August 2001


         1. History and microscopic view of previous 18 months - official
              view by Prof D Swartz, Vice-Chancellor


              The University of Fort Hare was established in 1916 and
              includes the Alice and Bisho campuses, with 5 200 students and
              570 staff members. It is a rural, agricultural and research
              university with a huge potential, central to the political
              economy of the Nkonkobe region.


              The name "Fort Hare" is internationally and nationally known
              and envisaged to be known as a Centre for Liberation Studies,
              a Centre for Leadership Development, and a Centre for
              Agriculture, Rural and Environmental Technology.


              (a) Decline and crisis of 1990s


                  There was a massive structural and strategic shift in
                  higher education due to the impact of globalisation on
                  higher education and serious leadership weaknesses.


              (b) Institutional crisis of 1998-99


                  The institutional crisis of 1998-99 revolved around three
                  sources:


                  *    A financial deficit of R90 million


                  *    Academic viability - student numbers declined (in
                       1999 there were 2 500 students, which affected the
                       macro-economic viability and university finances
                       because of a radically reduced government subsidy)
                  *    The failure of leadership at all levels.


              (c) New beginning - 2000


                  The crisis led to the departure of the management and the
                  appointment of an Interim Management Team and a New
                  Council after six months. The university had remarkable
                  stability on campus, with no boycotts or strikes.


                  The six-point plan was drafted, which included a
                  stabilisation process, short-term liquidity,
                  institutional review (to understand what was happening on
                  campus), the advent of Strategic Plan 2000 (SP 2000), and
                  management and leadership implementation.


                  SP 2000 sets out in broad strategic terms a new vision,
                  mission, corporate goals and institutional activities
                  aimed at laying a basis for comprehensively restructuring
                  and developing the university in the 21st century. It was
                  launched by the Deputy President, Mr J Zuma, in May 2000.
                  (SP 2000 is available on website ufh@ac.za.)


              (d) Vision


                  Fort Hare aspires to become a vibrant, equitable and
                  sustainable African university committed to teaching and
                  research excellence, building on its unique historical
                  role and rural location to provide an enriching education
                  service to its graduates and scholars.


              (e) Mission


                  Its mission is to provide high quality education of
                  international standard, contributing to the advancement
                  of knowledge that is socially and ethically relevant, and
                  applying that knowledge to the scientific, technological
                  and socio-economic development of our nation and the
                  wider world.


              (f) Corporate goals


                  *    Securing long-term sustainability and viability


                  *    Becoming the Centre for Leadership Development


                  *    Achieving teaching and research excellence


                       Addressing the development challenges of the region
                       and the nation


                  *    Becoming a world-class university.


              (g) Strategic objectives


                  The 10 strategic objectives, as mentioned by the Vice-
                  Chancellor, are to diversify and expand the revenue base,
                  to offer high quality and competitive programmes, to
                  sharpen the teaching and research skills base, to refocus
                  and realign academic programmes, to make strategic use of
                  Fort Hare's human capital resources, to improve the
                  quality of student and staff life, to increase the
                  capacity, quality and efficiency of support systems, to
                  forge new educational partnerships, to promote rural
                  development in Nkonkobe and the Eastern Cape region, and
                  to raise rural and development support for local
                  industry, agriculture and development sectors.


              (h) Implementation strategy - core interventions


                  *    Vision, governance and leadership


                       Prof D Swartz is of the view that Fort Hare needs to
                       involve people in order for them to be responsible.
                       There is a need for corporate commitment to SP 2000
                       values and ethics, to promote service ethos,
                       performance management and link-shared governance
                       with individual responsibility.


                  *    Academic restructuring


                       In January 2000, eight faculties were closed. Fort
                       Hare had created four new faculties: Agriculture and
                       Environmental Sciences; African and Democracy
                       Studies; Science and Technology; and Management,
                       Development and Commerce. The Govan Mbeki Research
                       and Development Centre was also established.


                       Their respective focuses would be:


                       Agriculture and Environmental Sciences: The science
                       of free-ranging animals, agronomics sciences,
                       environmental science and land use planning,
                       agricultural economics and rural development


                       African and Democracy Studies: Liberation studies,
                       Eastern Cape studies, music and arts academy, Nelson
                       Mandela Law School, theology of empowerment


                       Science and Technology: Indigenous resources
                       management and development, developmental
                       technologies, community health sciences, and
                       analytical sciences


                       Management, Development and Commerce: Education
                       management, public policy and management, business
                       and accounting, developmental studies, and co-
                       operative studies


                       The Govan Mbeki Research and Development Centre will
                       play a very important role in promoting research
                       culture, building strategic research linkages,
                       improving quality of research management, and
                       developing rural and development infrastructure.


                       They also appointed Executive Deans and granted VSPs
                       to 112 surplus staff. They phased out non-viable
                       programmes and introduced new ones.


                  *    Finance and revenue


                       This would involve updating financial records,
                       introducing a new FMS, programme-based budgeting,
                       training financial management, restructuring the Fort
                       Hare Foundation and starting a major capital fund
                       campaign to boost income.


                  *    Support services


                       This would involve the refurbishing of buildings,
                       modernising administration systems, improving student
                       services, outsourcing non-core services, and
                       upgrading IT infrastructure.


                  *    Human resources


                       This would include introducing new HR policies,
                       redeploying staff to new operational divisions and
                       faculties, a skills development plan, performance-
                       based management and an equity plan.


                  *    Strategic partnerships


                       This would include the Nkonkobe Development Plan, the
                       Agripart Initiative, the  Daimler/Chrysler
                       partnership, co-operative businesses, leadership
                       (students at work), and the Rhodes and Unitra
                       partnerships.


              (i) Current plans


                  Fort Hare had plans on some important matters, according
                  to Prof Swartz:


                  *    Three-year rolling plan


                  *    Business plan for new faculties


                  *    Financial growth plan: five years


                  *    Risk profile and risk management plan


                  *    Establishment of consulting arm


                  *    Major capital campaign.


              (j) Achievements


                  There has been unprecedented institutional stability at
                  Fort Hare. Their overdraft/deficit was reduced from R90
                  million to R49 million in one year, and they hope to be
                  completely out of the red by the end of 2004. They did it
                  on their own, without any help from consultants.


                  For the university to be a successful centre of academic
                  excellence, it has to be smaller and more focused. There
                  has been a major increase in student numbers: from 2 500
                  in 2000 to 5 200 in 2001 - growing market confidence in
                  the future of Fort Hare and beginning of investment
                  flows.


              (k) Weaknesses and threats


                  The financial fundamentals are still weak - the income
                  side requires serious attention. Further growth in
                  student numbers imposes serious budget constraints. New
                  faculties and programmes require time for consolidation
                  and development. The management systems and processes
                  still need to undergo major changes.


              (l) Major challenges facing Fort Hare


                  *    Maintaining internal support for SP 2000


                  *    Securing financial support for SP 2000 (key role of
                       the government, donors and alumni)


                  *    Policy certainty (no mixed signals to the market)


                  *    Consolidation gains made since 2000 and delivering
                       on critical reform path.


              (m) Regional collaboration, core and strategic missions


                  Prof Swartz said that key challenges in regional
                  collaboration were stability, strategic orientation of
                  the sector, viability and sustainability and meeting
                  policy objectives. The higher education sector could be
                  improved significantly - many changes have already taken
                  place in respect of selecting the most appropriate
                  instrument to meet particular challenges.


                  Higher education has two roles: a formal educational
                  mission and a strategic educational mission.
                  *    Formal educational mission


                       They can produce graduate skills for the economy and
                       do research to advance the frontiers of knowledge


                  *    Strategic educational mission


                       This includes the direct application of knowledge to
                       socio-economic development, human capital
                       development, technological innovation and
                       valorisation of the economy


                       The core and strategic missions in respect of
                       regional collaboration include the rationalisation of
                       serious duplication, the audit process, the creation
                       of common support services (IT, joint admission and
                       on-line registration), the sharing of costly staff
                       and courseware, joint enrolment and accreditation,
                       and inter-institutional capacity building (research,
                       management and teaching).


                       The strategic mission will also include striking long-
                       term partnerships with the government and industry in
                       the province, aligning the development strategy from
                       sector to human capital in the province, directly
                       stimulating the economic development process via
                       strategic knowledge application, and accessing
                       untapped revenue sources.


              (n) Strategic clusters


                  Agriculture and biotechnology; Marine Conservation and
                  Aquamarine Culture; Public Service Capacity Building;
                  Development and Rural Management; Education Management;
                  and Heritage and Cultural Tourism.


              (o) Approach of Fort Hare on issue of "merger"


                  Fort Hare does not support a "merger" vis-à-vis
                  UNITRA/Rhodes/Fort Hare. However, they are in favour of
                  structured partnerships around strategic goals that are
                  realistic, efficient and effective.


                  Fort Hare has numerous proposals on structured
                  partnerships:


                  *    To synergise core teaching and research missions or
                       audit institutions in the region


                  *    To expand the remittance of institutional resource-
                       sharing


                  *    To develop a strategy linked to regional economic
                       development


                  *    To establish an inter-institutional mechanism for
                       ensuring commitment.


         2. Fort Hare profile - official view by Prof R Bally, University
              Planner


              (a) Introspection and goals for new Fort Hare


                  The present management of Fort Hare was appointed early
                  in 1999. A strategic planning committee was formed, and
                  existing staff rather than consultants were used in a
                  participative, capacity-building process. The ruthless
                  introspection culminated in the Review Report of 1999.


                  Fort Hare, as one of its main goals, aims for long-term
                  sustainability and viability, being a world-class
                  university with emphasis on leadership training,
                  excellence in pertinent teaching and research, and
                  contributing to national development.


                  The SPC implementation control centre, co-ordinated by Dr
                  B Walter, has six implementation areas, each headed by a
                  staff member:


              (b) Vision and governance - Mr J Ruthman


                  Academic - Mr M Silinga
                  Support services - Ms Y Kambule-Soul
                  Human resources - Mrs N Mpete
                  Revenue and finance - Ms Z Ndlovu
                  Partnerships - Mr S Kobese


                  Approximately four to eight faculties, based on niche
                  areas, were identified in SP 2000. The new faculty
                  management structure is being implemented and Executive
                  Deans have been appointed in the new faculties.


                  The new faculties represent a very significant step in
                  the implementation process and the new levels of
                  implementation (i.e. strategic plans/business plans are
                  being produced at various levels - faculty, academic
                  unit, institute and administrative unit level).


              (c) Academic transformation


                  A new programme, driven by newly appointed Executive
                  Deans in each faculty in line with SAQA requirements and
                  SP 2000, interdisciplinary models, academic and financial
                  viability, market and social needs and a viability
                  template were developed, ready for application by the end
                  of August 2001. The new programme was completed and
                  submitted in terms of SAQA and CHE requirements.


              (d) University support systems
                  These systems include marketing and communication,
                  information technology, student support, and the quality
                  of life of students, library and archives, residences,
                  and sport and physical planning, as well as developing
                  the two campuses.


              (e) Projects and funding


                  It has been noted that much of the transformation should
                  come from external funds. The SP 2000 identifies areas
                  where funding is needed. The funding projects include:


                  Renovation: upgrading of residences, university frontage
                  and sports facilities
                  New projects: proposed music academy and student computer
                  laboratories


              (f) Human resources


                  The entire new organisational structure had started with
                  the faculty structure. There are totally new job
                  descriptions and reporting lines involving union and
                  staff negotiations and Labour Relations Act compliance.


                  Fort Hare envisages improved service provision to
                  students and encourages staff capacity development.


              (g) Finance and revenue strategies


                  There is expansion and diversification of the revenue
                  base, with a view to:


                  *    Increase student numbers, and retention


                  *    Maximisation of subsidy


                  *    Improved availability of financial assistance and
                       revenue through research and consultancy
                  *    Fundraising


                  *    Alumni mobilisation


                  *    Incentive packages for payment of fees


                  *    Selling of excess capital stock


                  *    Better use of under-utilised resources.


              (h) Community issues


                  An integrated development plan was developed with
                  Nkonkobe, based on the community and Fort Hare's need to
                  support Alice as a university town. There is also a
                  research action programme, funded from the Premier's
                  Office for developing community projects.


              (i) Partnerships
                  Fort Hare has partnerships with local and provincial
                  governments, NGOs and communities to improve the quality
                  of rural livelihood, specifically to reduce poverty. They
                  have also earmarked the business development centre as a
                  community-based project.


         3. Fort Hare: forward to viability - official view by Mr P Cole


              (a) Context of challenges


                  The major challenges are seen to be the rural setting,
                  changing demographics and degree selections, students
                  mostly coming from the low-income sector of society, and
                  rapid changes in respect of student catchment areas.


              (b) Rural setting - economy


                  As the university is located in the former Ciskei
                  homeland, the local infrastructure is poor. There is a
                  high rate of unemployment and local costs, and some
                  student catchment areas experience declines in per capita
                  income.


                  16% of the population lives in the Eastern Cape. 77% of
                  those employed in the Eastern Cape earn a monthly salary
                  of less than R2 501 (approximately R30 000 per annum). An
                  average income per household per month in the Eastern
                  Cape is R1 479 (R17 748 per annum). Of the total students
                  currently registered at Fort Hare, 4 131 come from the
                  Eastern Cape. The total annual cost of an undergraduate
                  law degree at Fort Hare is R20 000.


              (c) HIV/AIDS


                  There is a high percentage of HIV/AIDS in the Eastern
                  Cape, and life expectancy is down to 40. This clearly
                  means that graduates in the province can expect a working
                  life of 15 to 20 years. The epidemic impacts both on
                  graduates and on the university workforce.


              (d) Areas of recruitment


                  These are: South Africa - 4 779; Zimbabwe - 235; Lesotho
                  - 130; other SADC countries - 21; rest of Africa - 25;
                  other - 11.


              (e) Changes since 1999


                  1999: less than 1% were foreign students and over 70%
                  were from the "Border Corridor". Student recruitment
                  declined and female student ratios were low in some
                  faculties.


                  2001: foreign students count over 9%, and students are
                  recruited more widely (nationally). Student recruitment
                  is increasing and gender ratios are achieving equity.


              (f) Opportunities and risks


                  These are characterised by the funding formula tabled by
                  the Department of Education in March 2001. This formula
                  is driven by the cost factor and uses FTE (full-time
                  equivalent) enrolment with a two-year lag, as FTE is
                  always counting ahead. The 2001 subsidy was calculated
                  from 1999's enrolment figure, and the cost-driven budget
                  is adjusted downward.


                  At the time of the visit, the funding formula for the
                  2001-02 subsidy was R86,992 million. The view was that if
                  2001's enrolment was used, rather than 1999's, the
                  subsidy would be R102,9 million. These are funds lost due
                  to the lagged formula.


                  Fort Hare is not satisfied about how the funding formula
                  is structured and implemented.


                  Proposed new funding formula: this formula will be driven
                  by FTE enrolment, teaching and research outputs. It is
                  not cost-driven - prices are set within budget resources.
                  It is heavily weighted to higher degrees, not humanities.


                  NSFAS funding formula: the funds divided between
                  institutions based upon enrolment are weighted by race.
                  The awards allocated to students by institutions are
                  based on a means test. In Fort Hare, there are more
                  students and lesser funds. In 2000, the smallest average
                  award was R3 757 - 55% of the average size for
                  universities and 1,5% of all NSFAS funds.


                  There is a need for equity in respect of the NSFAS
                  funding formula. NSFAS funds to Fort Hare have been and
                  will be allocated as follows: 1999 - R7,91 million; 2000
                  - R7,2 million; 2001 - R7,9 million; 2002 - R10,12
                  million; 2003 - R13,7 million.


                  The main problem with the NSFAS is that it is very tough
                  on students, many being turned away. There is an upfront
                  payment of R1 500 for all students, and the student joins
                  the system based on the arrangement with the NSFAS.


                  Fort Hare needs extra support from the government, as it
                  is financially viable.


              (g) Student enrolment and staff


                  1997 - 4 591; 1998 - 4 068; 1999- 3 903; 2000 - 4 459;
                  2001 - 5 190. Postgraduates comprise 9% of the student
                  population (450), and include Honours students, 20 PhDs
                  and 120 Masters students.
                  There is an increase in postgraduates at Fort Hare, and
                  there is a need for bigger institutions in the country.


                  Student ethnicity: African - 5 158; White - 23; Coloured
                  - 19; Indian – 1 Student gender: females - 62%; males -
                  38%; B Prim Ed (mostly female) - 1 200.
                  Academic staff equity: Black - 55% (non-academic staff
                  mostly black); White - 45%.


                  Women remain under-represented at senior level, both in
                  the academic and non-academic sectors.


              (h) Personnel


                  The salary bill was drastically reduced over the previous
                  two years. They have limited salary increases until 2003,
                  with low average salary increases and rates in recent
                  years. Fort Hare needs to attract and retain key
                  academics with competitive salaries.


              (i) Student debt


                  Students drop out for financial reasons. Fort Hare
                  envisages a need for reform of NSFAS allocations.
                  Although it is difficult to collect debt from students
                  who have left the university, they have done major work
                  on student debts. They targeted an increase in debt
                  collection from registered students: 50% in 2001 to 70%
                  in 2002 and 2003.


              (j) Strategies - Fort Hare Viability


                  Strategies on Fort Hare Viability aim to:


                  *    Accommodate the recent increases in enrolment in the
                       existing formula


                  *    Phase in the new formula
                  *    Attain equitable NSFAS funding


                  *    Continue control of personnel costs and student debt
                       management


                  *    Seize opportunities for additional income


                  *    Manage improved performance and set targets for own
                       income.


              (k) Research and development


                  Research activity on masters and doctorate graduates,
                  publications, patents, reports and artifacts was slow at
                  the time of the visit. Postgraduate studies was being
                  restructured, and the research and development function
                  was centralised in the Govan Mbeki Research and
                  Development Centre.


                  Areas of research excellence included Agriculture
                  (several nodes), Chemistry, Life Sciences (several
                  nodes), Psychology, Languages, Theology and Law.


         4. Residences and refurbishment of hostels - official view by Ms L
              T Ngalo-Morrison, Dean of Students


              They have started renovations in an attempt to improve
              residences, as hostels must be conducive for learning.
              Students work on the hostel refurbishment project, for which
              R800 000 had been budgeted. Students took it upon themselves
              to repair and clean dilapidated hostels.


              Six student residences which had to be closed down, have been
              reopened and renovated to meet booming student accommodation
              needs. They need to raise funds from donors to refurbish
              buildings.


         5. Alumni - official view by Mr L Jacobs


              For the past three years, alumni stood central to
              transformation work. Mr L Jacobs had visited North America,
              Gauteng, Cape Town and interim structures to provide
              information on a continuous basis.


         6. Visit to archives - official view by Mr M Synders


              (a) Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College: (SOMAFCO)


                  This school, opened in Tanzania in 1972, aimed to train
                  young, black men and women to be the leaders, teachers
                  and professionals of the new South Africa, after the end
                  of apartheid. The main subjects during that time were
                  politics, drama and art. When the school was closed in
                  1992, the ANC entrusted Fort Hare with caring for its
                  archives. Along with papers from its missions around the
                  world came a collection of papers, artefacts and student
                  works from SOMAFCO.


                  The Hon G A M Mbeki donated his guitar from Robben
                  Island.


                  Documents, like SOMAFCO papers, audio-visual material,
                  federal seminary archives (the school closed in 1974) and
                  university documents of the 1980s, are kept in a locked
                  office.


              (b) Meeting with institutional forum


                  The dlegation was welcomed by Mr Kobese, Community
                  Partnership Co-ordinator. The institutional forum
                  consists of political structures and stakeholders, like
                  the SRC, student organisations, labour structures,
                  members of academic structures, members of the Council,
                  members of Nkonkobe municipality, members of Buffalo
                  City, and members of management. It is viewed as Fort
                  Hare's parliament.


                  Prof Mayatula gave a brief overview of the key functions
                  of the Committee and the objectives of the visit.


              (c) Challenges of national plan "to merge or not to merge" -
                  official view by Mr A Gwabeni


                  The CHE report suggests a combination of some
                  institutions; a combination of Fort Hare and Rhodes
                  University was specifically mentioned.


                  The national working committee, led by Mr S Macozama,
                  visited Fort Hare prior our visit to advise the Minister
                  of Education on how to minimise the number of tertiary
                  institutions.


                  A merger, according to Fort Hare, is a strategic and
                  internally generated decision taken by organisations, not
                  a superimposed solution. It is dependent on the sharing
                  of a common vision.


                  Regarding their experience in South African institutions,
                  the Silo mentality requires institutions to collaborate -
                  with uneven distribution of resources, the funding
                  formula must prioritise redress; sharing resources
                  through the funding formula should be encouraged; and
                  with artificial competition, institutions must focus on
                  specific niche areas.


              (d) Fort Hare views to merger


                  The institution is opposed to a merger, and feels that
                  mergers must be decisions of individual institutions.
                  Incremental and organic evolution of mergers are
                  preconditions for success in the public sector. There is
                  a strong view that collaboration is the short- to the
                  medium-term solution, and there have been discussions
                  with UNITRA, Rhodes and other institutions outside the
                  Eastern Cape on concrete programmes for collaboration.


              (e) Current and future areas of collaboration


                  Current programmes include library services, an IT
                  infrastructure and health programmes, while future areas
                  include a central admission office, course development,
                  quality assurance and presentation of courses.


              (f) Why opposed to merger?


                  *    Fort Hare transformation project: The good work done
                       may be undone, and its vision (which includes
                       multiculturalism, new values concommittant with the
                       new society they are building and nation building,
                       which addresses socio-economic development and racial
                       and gender equity) may be clouded


                  *    Micro-economics of project: There is a possibility
                       of the system imploding as a result of too much being
                       loaded on it (a question of its ability to absorb new
                       challenges)


                  *    Economic implications of merger: It may cost more to
                       set up and maintain the administrative systems, and
                       there will be implications for local economies, which
                       will have a direct impact on the shifting of the
                       administration.


                  Fort Hare sees the higher education system in South
                  Africa and in the Eastern Cape evolving organically on an
                  incremental basis, with full support from the government,
                  and collaboration as the short-term solution. A clear
                  regulatory system must help align institutions to
                  national priorities.


         7. Student funding - official view by Mr L O Mabuyane, SRC
              president


              Mr Mabuyane saw no need to compare Fort Hare's political
              context in respect of student funding with institutions that
              have been advantaged historically, like UCT and WITS.


              The maximum number of 411 students for tuition (i.e. R4 120
              per student) is seen as a serious threat, and the funding
              formula is also a problem at Fort Hare. Many matriculants with
              exemption who reside in the rural areas are sitting at home
              without any form of assistance because their parents are
              uneducated and unemployed and cannot provide any form of
              financial assistance for their children to further their
              education at tertiary level. R29 million is expected from the
              NSFAS.


              Student quality of life also needs to be taken on board; it
              must be checked whether residences are user-friendly to all
              students.


              The government and the NSFAS need to re-examine the funding
              formula to provide financial assistance for needy students.
              Fort Hare needs to attract academic staff. The more students
              on campus, the more funding the institution receives from the
              NSFAS.


              Student debt


              The SRC played a major role in convincing and encouraging
              those who were able to pay their fees, to do so. This made the
              SRC unpopular on campus. Student debt results from two main
              reasons:


              *   Dropouts are unable to pay the university, as most of them
                  are unemployed


              *   No certificate is issued if outstanding fees are not paid
                  in full, and students leave the system.


              In this respect, the NSFAS has its own way of tracing persons.


         8. Conditions of employment - official view by Mr N R Mboniswa


              There was a very intensive bargaining process between Fort
              Hare and stakeholders. They compared salaries of academic and
              non-academic staff with those of UPE, UniVenda and UWC, and it
              appeared that their salaries were competitive in neither the
              labour market nor compared with other institutions of higher
              learning. The salary of the Vice-Chancellor is equivalent to
              that of a Dean at UPE. The implication of this was that the
              economy of Nkonkombe would be affected, should people leave
              the area.


              Staff turnover


              Reasons for staff turnover:


              *   Most staff were deployed by the government


              *   Fort Hare was unable to retain staff


              *   Salaries were not competitive.


     E.     University of Transkei - 7 August 2001


         On arrival, the delegation was warmly welcomed by Prof N Morgan
         (the Administrator) and his management. The University of Transkei
         was established in 1975, and the medical school started in 1986.


         The Minister had visited the institution five weeks before the
         delegation's visit. The nursery school and in-service centre were
         destroyed by a tornado. Due to financial constraints they were
         never repaired and were collapsing. Renovations will start with
         residences, which would cost R1,5 million.


         1. Medical School


              In 2001, there were 74 registered students at the medical
              school, and they were expecting an increase to 95 in 2002. The
              medical faculty had 749 medical students, of whom 34 were
              postgraduates. These figures formed the anchor of the
              university. They had also checked on which units were not
              viable, not giving a unit a chance to use the surplus of
              another unit.


              Biochemistry laboratory: The building is a pre-fabricated
              structure consisting of two big rooms, used both as
              biochemistry and physiology laboratories. Due to insufficient
              space, students are divided into groups for lecture sessions,
              attending on different times each day. During examination
              times, both rooms are converted into examination rooms.


              It only accommodates 10 students. Some students are from the
              Technikons, doing in-service training for six months.


              There is no air conditioning in the laboratory, and there is
              always an unbearable smell. The Head of Anatomy, Prof N
              Baguma, appealed to the government to provide the institution
              with facilities to produce the best doctors in the country.
              Despite the conditions, the lecturers want to produce good
              quality doctors.


         2. Science Faculty - official view by Mr B R Madikizela


              The delegation visited the cold room, which had a fresh-water
              laboratory. Mr B R Madikizela, a P.HD student, worked on the
              water research commission project, doing water quality and
              faunal studies in the Umzimvubu catchment, with particular
              emphasis on species as indicators of environmental change. It
              was part of his Ph D. They produced the report for the water
              commission, indicating their observations.


              The primary aim of the project was to establish a water
              quality database and an inventory of aquatic fauna in the
              Umzimvubu and its main tributaries. A secondary aim was
              identification of species sensitive to environmental threats
              which might be used as future indicators of environmental
              change. (This report is available on request from the
              Committee Secretary, Ms N C Manjezi.)


         3. Zoology Museum


              This museum was established in 1998. The high schools in the
              area visit it regularly and familiarise themselves with
              certain species. In the Botany Department, they have collected
              4 000 indigenous plants.
         4. African Archive


              This Department has a wide range of South African indigenous
              and popular music. The equipment and about 30 000 records were
              donated to the Department. The video machine, television and
              computers were donated by the University of Maiz in Germany.


         5. Unitra Sasol Library


              This R3 million project was donated by Sasol, built in 1997,
              officially opened on 18 May 2000. It operates 24 hours a day.
              It houses literature for five faculties. There is an on-line
              digital catalogue, seminar and video conferencing, and
              students can access literature anytime. The former President,
              Dr R N Mandela, has his own reading room, which he uses when
              he visits the university.


         6. Meeting with Administrator, Management, Deans, Representatives
              from labour structures and SRC - official view by Prof N
              Morgan, Administrator


              (a) Vision


                  UNITRA aimed to be a leading university in Africa,
                  focusing on innovative programmes addressing rural
                  development needs.


              (b) Mission


                  UNITRA is committed to excellence by offering relevant
                  and effective teaching, research and community outreach
                  programmes with specific emphasis on the promotion of
                  sustainable rural development, while providing service to
                  its clientele through optimal resource utilisation.


              (c) Location


                  It is located in the poorest and most densely populated
                  region of the Kei, Wild Coast and Drakensberg areas. The
                  Eastern Cape has a rural population of six million
                  people, and 65% live in rural areas. The rural Kei and
                  Wild Coast districts have a population of three million,
                  half the population of the province. 54% are females, and
                  60% of the rural people are female. In rural communities,
                  youths make up to 60% of the population.


                  UNITRA is thus in a poverty-stricken area, households
                  having an income of less than R352,52 per month. The
                  rural catchment area of UNITRA has inadequate access to
                  social and economic infrastructure and services: only 24%
                  have running water; only 31% have flush toilets; 31% do
                  not have electricity; 4% have access to
                  telecommunications; there are 0,3 medical officials per 1
                  000, compared to the national figure of 6%; educational
                  levels are the lowest in the whole of South Africa.


         7. Institution indicators for financial sustainability


              Future financial sustainability depends on State funding,
              diverse income streams (including consultancy and contract
              research), adequacy of student financial aid, based on NSFAS
              criteria, the ability to collect fees, and the ability to
              adjust budgets.


              (a) Key issues and challenges faced by UNITRA


                  *    Reducing fixed costs


                  *    Ensuring full cost recovery


                  *    Introducing financial discipline through devolved
                       budgeting


                  *    Fee strategies and collection.


                  In 1999, the university had a R100 million overdraft
                  until March 2000. They received a subsidy of R104
                  million, which was regarded as insufficient.


              (b) Some realities


                  There are limited funds from the Treasury. Restructuring
                  will have to be deliberately engineered and managed if
                  success is to be achieved. The notion of reducing the
                  number of institutions does not mean reducing access to
                  higher education. The sensibility of each arrangement
                  must be determined on how it responds to the goals of the
                  National Plan for Higher Education. Comprehensive
                  technical intelligence about every regional site is a pre-
                  requisite for the project to succeed.


                  Prof Morgan met with the Minister of Education on 4 June
                  2001, and the budget issue was discussed. Due to budget
                  constraints, academic staff and 282 workers were
                  retrenched. The Department of Labour was contacted for
                  the social plan, especially for those students who were
                  registered at the university. UNITRA also made a
                  commitment to re-employ the workers who were retrenched.


              (c) NSFAS funding


                  The university is underfunded by NSFAS. As a result, they
                  intend to request a supplementary amount. The
                  affordability in respect of the region is different from
                  that of any other region. Applying the criteria for those
                  who have applied, would require R24 million.


                  As a huge amount of R39 million is still owed by
                  students, the SRC also assists with the collection of
                  fees by broadcasting on UNITRA community radio.


              (d) Viability in finances


                  The working committee needs to be assisted with technical
                  expertise and quality technical information. The health
                  centre needs to realise its current status in terms of
                  viability.


                  Viability assessments were to be completed by the end of
                  August 2001. Various departments could be closed and some
                  could be strenghtened. The view is that if some
                  departments are to be closed, there should be other forms
                  of restructuring, and students can be transferred to
                  other universities to complete their studies.


         8. Faculty of Health Sciences - official view by Prof E L Mazwai


              This faculty has 749 students in the School of Medicine, the
              School of Nursing and the School of Allied Health Professions.
              Teaching takes place at three campuses in Umtata, East London
              and Port Elizabeth, which form part of the Academic Health
              Service of the Eastern Cape. In 14 years, UNITRA has graduated
              more than 200 medical doctors of a quality equal to, if not
              better than, many medical schools in the country.


              (a) Teaching


                  Their strength has been their teaching philosophy, being
                  problem-based learning and community-based education.
                  This is now world-recognised - the faculty is a WHO
                  collaborating centre. Students are exposed to community
                  issues early in training (first year), including
                  indigenous knowledge systems, such as traditional
                  healers. In addition to the teaching standard, they have
                  developed a computer-based teaching laboratory, a
                  telemedicine unit and a professional skills laboratory to
                  improve quality of teaching and graduates' competencies.


              (b) Service


                  By its very nature, community-based education and
                  training are decentralised from tertiary through to
                  secondary and primary health care centres, and with
                  teaching comes service. The teaching hospital in Umtata
                  serves a population of 2,9 million, with more than 100
                  specialists. They have also initiated a postgraduate
                  programme and training specialists in eight medical
                  fields - they are trained at centres in Port Elizabeth,
                  East London and Umtata. Medical registrars also improve
                  the quality of care given to patients.


                  UNITRA and UCT have an agreement on training registered
                  students in medicine and postgraduate courses.
              (c) Research


                  As most tertiary institutions are judged on the basis of
                  research output and publications, the faculty has had a
                  limited output in this area. This has been mostly due to
                  developmental and infrastructure restrictions in terms of
                  laboratory and equipment. However, they do have an MRC
                  unit (on carcinoma of oesophogus, with research in
                  molecular biology). The university collaborates with the
                  Department of Health and overseas universities on
                  HIV/AIDS research. Most of the research is community-
                  based and service-oriented.


              (d) Infrastructure


                  The university plan was to increase the number of medical
                  students from 90 to 120 per class over the following
                  three years, and they wanted to add six Allied Health
                  Professions - Occupational Therapy, Physiotheraphy,
                  Speech and Hearing Therapy, Nutrition and Dietetics,
                  Radiotherapy and Medical Technology. They have plans and
                  the potential to increase the number and mix of health
                  sciences they train, but the major constraint is
                  infrastructure, which needs financial input. Discussions
                  with the Department of Education on a new medical campus
                  adjacent to the hospital at a cost of R120 million have
                  been put on hold to see what facilities could be
                  developed on the existing campus at a reduced cost. As a
                  matter of urgency, the development of the in-service
                  training centre for laboratories for students and
                  research, and also teaching, would be the most
                  appropriate. UNITRA was able to achieve with very limited
                  funding because of chronic under-funding nationally.


                  In the last four years, conditional grants from the
                  Provincial Administration have helped to alleviate the
                  situation. There has never been any major injection of
                  capital for infrastructural development, either at
                  inception of the medical school in 1986 or after the new
                  democracy in 1994.


                  There are infrastructure issues that have not been
                  attended to, and a merger will bring additional costs in
                  the short term. Money needs to be injected for
                  infrastructure. Staff never received increments, now they
                  have become demotivated.


              (e) Academic restructuring


                  All the programmes are complying with the mission. They
                  revisited it in 1999 and in 2000, but there were no
                  substantive shift. As UNITRA is the largest single
                  employer in the region, they have spent R160 million per
                  annum.


              (f) Student enrolment


                  The student numbers in 2001 have grown to 4 500, compared
                  to 3 800 in 2000.


              (g) Governance


                  There is no council at UNITRA. There is an administrator
                  who is in support of the management team of the
                  university. There is a need to appoint a new Vice-
                  Chancellor and a new council.


                  Due to the turmoil in 1999, the council resigned.
                  Meetings were held with community and parents to inform
                  them of ongoing progress. The Department of Education did
                  not have any faith in the university and nothing happened
                  to establish the council.


                  By the end of August, they were to start the process to
                  establish a governance council. Prof Morgan informed the
                  delegation that the Auditor-General's report and other
                  reports formed the basis of the issue to be attended to
                  on two levels:


                  *    An intention to provide residence for students and
                       lecture halls - a decision was taken to build the
                       structures, as this money was not taken from the
                       operational budget


                  *    Internal controls - new policies to exercise
                       discipline.


              (h) Hospital


                  A positive development is the commissioning of the new
                  Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital. It has 480 beds at a
                  cost of R350 million. It will attract specialists to the
                  area, especially South Africans, to teach and offer
                  specialised services. There is hope to establish new
                  specialities such as cardiology and cardiac surgery,
                  radio physics and radiotherapy, vascular surgery and
                  renal transplantation.


                  There was great concern that what they have achieved so
                  far, has been done at great sacrifice in human cost, with
                  no improvement in salaries or promotions for the last
                  four years. If they are to prevent diminishing morale and
                  retain staff against competition from outside
                  institutions, capital injection is absolutely urgent.
                  This way they feel that they can reverse the downward
                  spiral, stabilise the Faculty, attract more specialists
                  for specialised services, and improve on research and
                  publications. With the increase in the medical student
                  class and addition of the six departments in the School
                  of Allied Health Professions, they have a capacity for
                  1 000 students over the next three years. All this can be
                  done at a very modest cost, which the university
                  management is currently formulating and calculating.


                  The delegation visited the massive site to see the new
                  academic hospital, still under construction. This
                  training hospital is built by the Department of Health
                  (50% national and 50% provincial), and is expected to be
                  completed by the end of March 2002. The estimated budget
                  to run the hospital is R196 million per annum.


              (i) Merger


                  The merger in a classic sense purposely targets areas of
                  synergistic benefits - people seek deliberate benefits
                  and synergies and manage these to new organisations. In
                  respect of certain private companies, this was a failure.
                  In creating a merger, according to Prof Morgan, the
                  institution needs to address the issues with Rhodes, as
                  they have a governance council.


                  *    Negative aspects


                       Other areas of excellence, apart from medical
                       science, which, because of the financial turmoil,
                       have been neglected. Staff members had been abused
                       for the previous five years in respect of promotion,
                       increments and the taking away of other benefits.
                       Everything the university is busy doing in this
                       respect, will disappear if there is a merger.


                  *    Businesses supporting UNITRA or other sources to
                       improve finances


                       They had established links with the business
                       community and received huge support from the
                       community. There were ongoing meetings with business
                       to address the finance issue.
                       Some historically disadvantaged institutions helped
                       to improve the financial position. There was a need
                       to equalise funding in order to address the gap
                       between Gauteng, the Western Cape and their region.


              (j) Payment of fees


                  Discussions were held with the student leadership about
                  the commitment of students to pay fees. This was
                  broadcast on the community radio, and there was a good
                  response. Decisions were taken by parents and students to
                  make arrangements to pay outstanding fees, but some did
                  not honour this commitment.


              (k) Retrenchments


                  These came about because of a shortfall in respect of the
                  pension fund. The university made specific arrangements
                  to develop retrenched staff and reskill them for new
                  jobs. They also committed to the social plan those who
                  wanted to study at the university.


              (l) Issue of redress


                  They cannot tackle the issue of redress if there are
                  institutional, financial and regional problems. This
                  needs serious attention.


              (m) Management of institution


                  There are few fundamentals and policies in respect of
                  running the system. There is a need for strengthening
                  middle management, training and capacity development of
                  staff. Human resource and technical issues need
                  attention. Although there is no council, they have an
                  audit committee performing that managerial function.


                  Rev E Guwa had a very strong view of not closing
                  historically disadvantaged universities down, as he was a
                  product of those universities.


              (o) Institutional forum


                  This forum was set up according to the statutory
                  requirements, and was composed of all internal structures
                  of student associations, labour and community structures.


              (p) NEHAWU input


                  NEHAWU endorsed what Prof Morgan had said, and expressed
                  disapproval on certain issues:


                  *    Transformation was viewed as a most painful and
                       difficult process. NEHAWU was not against
                       retrenchment with benefits, but in support of change.
                       There were structures in place to address those
                       problems


                  *    They viewed the sustainability and viability of the
                       institution as very important.


              (q) SRC input


                  The extent of the problems mentioned impacted very
                  negatively on students. The SRC have made efforts to
                  persuade students to pay their fees. The gravity of the
                  problem has caused them to make history - it was indeed
                  unusual to find a situation whereby the management and
                  the students agreed that the latter would pay 50% of
                  their debt before the beginning of the new term. This has
                  shown the level of maturity of the SRC in understanding
                  the dynamics of co-operative governance, particularly in
                  regard to pulling the institution out of its financial
                  mess.
                  They were against closure of the university, and
                  moreover, not in support of a merger - it was not deemed
                  as beneficial to the institution.


                  They also asked the NSFAS to increase the grant because
                  most people in the area were unemployed and there was no
                  industry to support the institution financially.


                  The SRC's view was that a merger would adversely affect
                  those from historically disadvantaged areas.


     F.     University of Natal - 8 August 2001


         The Vice-Chancellor, Prof B M Gourley, warmly welcomed the
         delegation at the Pietermaritzburg campus.


         1. Overview - Prof B M Gourley


              The University of Natal, located in KwaZulu-Natal and
              established in 1910, has an enrolment of 22 000 students, of
              whom over 15 000 are undergraduates. As such, it is the second
              largest residential university in South Africa. It comprises
              two centres, one in Durban on the coast and the other in the
              provincial capital, Pietermaritzburg, some 80 km inland.


              The Nelson Mandela School of Medicine is part of the
              university, and is located on the Durban campus. In total,
              there are four campuses - Durban, Pietermaritzburg, Medical
              and Edgewood.


              During the 1990s most students were white - approximately 13
              500. Now almost 76% are black students.


              It is one of the top-rated universities in South Africa in
              terms of research output and independent ratings by the
              National Research Foundation, and has formal links with some
              240 leading universities in the USA, Europe and the Far East.
              It is known as a centre of excellence in Africa and is doing
              significant research into HIV/AIDS.


              Many international students are studying here.


              The governing structures are in hands of the academics on the
              Durban campus.


              In the early 1990s the Durban campus alone housed 84 different
              NGOs, most of them refugees from the apartheid regime. Their
              presence on the campus profoundly affected the nature of the
              university and the conversation about its role in South Africa
              at this point in its history. Students were involved in
              working with the NGOs.


              (a) Vision


                  The university's strategy is one of Quality with Equity.
                  It dedicates its excellence in teaching, research and
                  development to progress through reconstruction. It serves
                  South Africa, and KwaZulu-Natal in particular, by
                  delivering quality teaching, which enables students from
                  all backgrounds to realise their academic potential and
                  to obtain degrees of an international standard.


                  It undertakes quality research up to national and
                  international standards, and provides development
                  services which meet community needs.


                  It is a socially responsive organisation. At the time of
                  the visit they were condusting an HIV research project
                  (160 different projects), and many are placed in the
                  networking centre.


                  KwaZulu-Natal has 80 000 teachers, of whom 30% are HIV-
                  positive. They really need to launch a substantive
                  campaign to attend to this issue.


              (b) Mission


                  They strive to serve all sections of the community
                  through excellence in scholarship, teaching, learning,
                  research and development.


              (c) Student numbers and composition


                  The size of the university has changed substantially over
                  the last 10 years. There has been planned growth in the
                  face of virtually no State support in respect of
                  infrastructure. It has been made possible by making
                  provision for loan funding for students with the
                  potential to succeed but not the money to afford the
                  fees.


              (d) Research profile


                  The profile has changed over the years, as an entirely
                  different set of policies came into effect to support new
                  directions. These policies were designed to encourage not
                  only a more entrepreneurial approach to research but also
                  a more nuanced approach. They emphasise potential links
                  between research and development and aim to find ways in
                  which the research agenda could be influenced by
                  development issues that are fed by the research agenda.


                  Initiatives that support the goals of regional and
                  national agendas are actively encouraged. HIV/AIDS is a
                  good example.


                  There is huge capacity for research and postgraduate
                  studies in the region, and the percentage of
                  undergraduate studies has increased. Most students are in
                  the open learning mode on the Pietermaritzburg campus.
              (e) Staff profile


                  The staff profile has not been changed as much as one
                  would have liked. Both availability of staff and labour
                  law considerations impact on this. Equity plans are in
                  place.


              (f) Race in 1990 and in 2000


                  There have been enormous disparities in respect of gender
                  and race.


                  1990 - 54% White; 30% African; 3% Coloured; 13% Indian
                  2000 - 49% White; 25% African; 4% Coloured; 22% Indian


              (g) Gender in 1990 and in 2000


                  1990 - 34% female and 66% male
                  2000 - 44% female and 56% male


                  A higher percentage of female students registered between
                  1990 and 2000 than males. An age/race profile of students
                  in 2000 showed that undergraduate Coloureds, Indians and
                  whites were younger than blacks.


                  Registration by area or specialisation - many study
                  business and commerce. By 2001 the number of students
                  pursuing a career in humanities had increased; the number
                  in science and technology grew by 10%.


                  The university also encourages foreign students to enrol
                  in order to improve the standard of education. It is
                  important for the educational learning experience to have
                  international students on campus.


              (h) Distance education


                  They want to retain and control quality distance
                  education. At present, there are between 4 000 and 5 000
                  involved in distance learning, of whom 2 500 are
                  Africans.


              (i) Merging


                  The university is opposed to a merger. They strongly
                  believe they need to equalise the conditions of service
                  and grant generous retrenchment packages, should there be
                  a merger with Durban-Westville. As the two institutions
                  have different scales, a merger will be disruptive to
                  their administrative way of doing things, as they will
                  have more students.


                  The university does not want to put donor and research
                  funding at risk which it receives from the international
                  community. The entire process has to focus on producing a
                  better higher education system.


         2. Transformation process - official view by Prof E A Ngara,
              Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Students and Transformation


              Prof Ngara played an advocacy role and sought to promote
              transformation in areas where they seemed slow to achieve the
              desired objective in respect of certain aspects of
              development. He had attended conferences and seminars where
              the view was expressed that the last group of universities to
              be transformed would be those that called themselves "liberal
              universities".


              What is transformation?


              The White Paper on Higher Education outlined the framework for
              change, making it clear that the higher education system had
              to be planned, governed and funded as a single co-ordinated
              national system. It identified the areas in which
              transformation should take place and outlined the principles
              that should guide the process of transformation, but stopped
              short of defining the concept.


              It referred to a complete and fundamental change for the
              better, and suggested that transformation had to entail change
              from what was the norm to a new norm, from a culture and set
              of values and practices that prevailed in the past to a new
              culture and set of values and practices.


              He identified four principal domains in which transformation
              should take place:


              (a) Governance - it referred to the development of a more
                  democratic system of power relations between the various
                  sectors of the institution by, for instance, seeing to it
                  that fundamental changes occur to ensure adherence to the
                  principles of democratic governance, accountability,
                  transparency and inclusiveness in decision-making. This
                  was underpinned by compliance with the requirements of
                  the Higher Education Act, the Employment Equity Act and
                  other relevant legislation and policy documents.


              (b) Demographics and equity - it referred to changes taking
                  place in an institution to reflect the demography of the
                  nation and the region. Enrolment figures and staff
                  statistics should change to ensure diversity, race and
                  gender equity, as well as representation of people with
                  disability.


              (c) Institutional/organisational culture - it referred to the
                  degree of transparency and openness in the communication
                  system and decision-making processes of the institution,
                  the extent to which linguistic and cultural diversity was
                  recognised, accepted and celebrated, the degree of
                  sensitivity to diversity issues (i.e race, gender, sexual
                  orientation and disability) and the extent to which there
                  was a culture of debate and democratic disputation, as
                  opposed to violent demonstration by students and decrees
                  by authorities.


              (d) The core functions domain - it referred to fundamental
                  changes made in teaching, research, the community and
                  national service to facilitate national, economic, social
                  and political transformation, the key elements being
                  curriculum, quality and growth, student development,
                  knowledge production and responsiveness to national and
                  community needs.


              Transformation in respect of all these domains should be
              relatively easily achievable in organisations with a tradition
              of openness in their decision-making processes.
              Prof Ngara further mentioned that while the university was
              normally classified as a historically white university, the
              Faculty of Medicine was historically black; it was the only
              medical faculty in a long time that was training African,
              Indian and Coloured doctors, before MEDUNSA was established.


              Student numbers broadly represented the demographics of
              KwaZulu-Natal. These numbers, as at 24 July 2001, read as
              follows:


              Race     Number      Percentage


              African  10 620       44,81%
              Indian    7 404       31,24%
              White     4 995       21,07%
              Coloured    665        2,76%
              Other        25        0,10%
                  .....      -------
              Total    23 700       99,80%
                  .... -------
              The university was not doing well in respect of the racial
              composition of staff. However, a few years ago a programme
              funded by the Mellon Foundation was put in place to help
              promising academics from previously disadvantaged backgrounds
              to acquire postgraduate degrees to render them suitable for
              appointment to academic positions. Not all management members
              believed that this programme would help them move fast enough
              to accelerate the appointment of blacks, especially Africans,
              to the academic staff. They produced a document which they
              believed could help accelerate the process - it was still to
              be considered by the verious structures.


         3. Curriculum development and access programmes - official view by
              Prof A C Bawa, Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Academics


              Curriculum development is a defining characteristic of the
              university. It has constantly been supported through strategic
              investment of resources, the highest level of innovation in
              curriculum development and through teaching and learning.
              Every year, they make three Distinguished Teacher Awards,
              which celebrate its excellence.


              Curriculum development is at the heart of the education
              process in that it is centrally linked to developing good
              citizens of a democratic South Africa. It is therefore
              critical that students have a sense of their role in the
              reconstruction and development of the nation and possess the
              skills and framework to lead ethical lives as they embark on
              careers requiring leadership and entrepreneurship.


              The Strategic Initiatives Document states that student should
              not leave the University without a keen appreciation of:


              *   The values and concerns of the different communities in
                  which they will be living and working
              *   Where they are in history and what responsibilities and
                  leadership roles they may be expected to fulfil


              *   The ethics of their particular chosen careers and of
                  making choices at this moment in history.


              To facilitate this, they have created an Ethics Centre, a
              Leadership Centre and a Centre for Entrepreneurship. They have
              also established a significantly large Service Learning
              Project, which allows students to spend part of their study
              time working in communities and reflecting on that work. About
              20% of the students have some form of exposure to service
              learning.


              The university has committed itself to developing a set of
              core basic competencies in every student - these are taught
              through a set of core foundational modules.


              The curriculum development process is strongly influenced by
              the need for multi-discipline, which is evident in
              undergraduate programmes. They have led the way in this regard
              in South Africa.


              They have also established a Centre for Information Technology
              in Higher Education, which facilitates the optimisation of the
              role of IT in learning and teaching. They are ensuring that
              they have sufficient computers on an outstanding network to
              facilitate the development of a new learning paradigm, which
              involves the use of constructivism as a philosophy of
              learning.


              The university has serious concerns about the impact of
              traditional learning paradigms on the underdevelopment of the
              "right brain", and has a large project under way to ensure
              more holistic left brain/right brain learning.


              Access programmes
              They have three kinds of access programmes:


              *   Students with matriculation exemption but without a
                  sufficiently satisfactory pass for admission to degree
                  programmes - they would wish to study science,
                  engineering or medicine but do not have satisfactory
                  passes in Mathematics and Science.


              *   Students with a senior certificate but without
                  matriculation exemption and who show potential to succeed
                  in higher education - they would generally be placed in
                  one-year foundation or access programmes which would lead
                  to access to degree programmes.


              *   Adult learners without senior certificates - they have not
                  had the opportunity to complete their schooling but
                  demonstrate a satisfactory level of numeracy and
                  literacy.


              The university also offers a number of undergraduate and
              graduate programmes in a mixed-mode format for working people.


              In 2001 there were about 500 new students in access programmes
              in respect of science and engineering, 200 in humanities and
              social sciences, 500 in management sciences, 150 adult
              learners in open learning programmes and 5 000 workers in
              programmes designed for them.


         4. Integrated student body - official view by Mr T Wills, Dean of
              Students, and Dr D Rajab, Dean of Social Development


              The students fully embrace integration. 18% of them are
              married. The SRC is present at all levels of student
              governance - about 10 to 12 students for 10 000 students (they
              need to review this).


              The institution has also been seen to encourage integration in
              sport. There is a wide range of sports, and students adhere to
              the sports policy.


              They opened their residences in 1984; house committees see to
              the welfare of students. 25% to 30% live in residences, which
              were full at the time of the visit. Many come from
              metropolitan areas. There is no gender segregation.


              The number of white students declined because mostly blacks
              live in the residences. The whites left because they felt
              uncomfortable staying with black students and could not afford
              the residential costs, which were expensive. Some black
              students who could not afford the costs, moved to cheaper
              places.


              (a) Student Development


                  Student Development is located in the Division of Student
                  Services, and is responsible for the conceptualisation,
                  implementation and quality assurance of all student
                  development programmes offered by the division. These
                  include Student Counselling and Careers, Campus Health
                  Clinics, Residences, Student Leadership Development,
                  Sport, Administration, Student Governance, Clubs and
                  Societies, Student Academics Affairs and Financial Aid.
                  They put in a huge effort to support students.


                  Student Development aims to address development needs of
                  all students at the university through professional
                  services of the division. This involves an analysis of
                  the special need of students within the context of higher
                  learning.


                  It calls for strategic planning and implementation of
                  systems that support developmental growth of all students
                  in a dynamic and changing context.


                  The task of student service providers in the various
                  sections is to set up structures that will provide
                  opportunities for life skills learning in curricular and
                  co-curricular activities.


              (b) Student Development Plan - rationale


                  The rationale for the development of a strategic plan
                  arose from the following realities:


                  *    The university has a duty to address national needs.
                       South Africa requires well-trained professionals who
                       are well-rounded, critical and independent thinkers.


                  *    The job market is competitive and demands excellent
                       graduates with strong interpersonal and leadership
                       skills and high levels of accountability, integrity
                       and commitment to industry.


                  *    It is a world-class institution with its reputation
                       at stake when it comes to production of its
                       graduates. Universities are also under pressure to
                       maintain a competitive edge over other institutions.


                  *    The imperative to address the diverse needs of
                       students warrants a repositioning of student
                       development initiatives from periphery to mainstream.


                  *    The HIV/AIDS pandemic has widespread implications
                       for student intakes, financial aid, health and
                       support services, and training and counselling.


              (c) Guiding principles
                  To address the developmental needs of a diverse and
                  dynamic student population, the plan will encompass the
                  following guiding principles:


                  *    The holistic development of students involves a
                       partnership with all sectors of the university
                       community. This includes Academics, student affairs
                       professionals, students and the general community.


                  *    The application of a multi-pronged, multi-
                       disciplinary and multi-cultural perspective in the
                       development of all programmes to address the needs of
                       a diverse and dynamic student population.


                  *    The introduction of systemic interventions
                       encompassing institutional changes to facilitate the
                       development of a new type of graduate in keeping with
                       the changing demand of society.


                  *    Quality with Equity. Effective utilisation of
                       resources and the provision of support to enable
                       learners from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds
                       to succeed.


                  The Office of the Dean of Student Development is offering
                  a new 10-week winter semester certificate course in
                  collaboration with other academics and administrative
                  departments on the Durban and Pietermaritzburg campuses
                  for student services staff and graduate students who may
                  wish to pursue a career path in student services. They
                  have already trained 39 students in these courses.


         5. Financial support - official view by Rev J Ngomane, Director:
              Financial Aid Service
              The establishment of the NSFAS by the new democratic
              government is one of the most important initiatives that
              underpin the transformation of educational access in South
              Africa.


              The stability the scheme has brought to campuses nationwide
              has been evidenced by the lack of educational boycotts and
              student unrest during the past three to four years. The
              government's visionary thinking regarding the NSFAS and
              continued support of these endeavors should be applauded. The
              appearance of the delegation from the Committee charged with
              consultation with all stakeholders indicates the dedication to
              the cause of educational justice for all in the new democratic
              South Africa.


              (a) Background


                  The university has always been involved with the needs of
                  poor students. Prior to the early days of transformation
                  from 1984, the bursaries and scholarship office
                  administered a means test to award the few bursaries from
                  various sources at its disposal (e.g. bequests, deceased
                  estates). By 1988 that office was receiving 5 000
                  applications a year from needy students.


                  The university responded by allocating funds from its
                  limited budget (about R13 million in 2001) to the annual
                  budget of the newly constituted Financial Aid Service.
                  This was supplemented during the early 1990s by
                  organisations such as Kagiso Trust, the IDT (Independent
                  Development Trust), the South African Institute of Race
                  Relations (SAIRR) and the Kelloggs Foundation.


                  By 1996 they had to limit the intake of needy entrants to
                  500 per year in order to manage the budgetary
                  requirements responsibly. The number of active financial
                  aid applications settled at about 3 500 per year. They
                  are currently funding about 2 000 undergraduates.


                  About 13% of the student body is deemed sufficiently
                  financially disadvantaged to receive benefits from the
                  NSFAS. Therefore there is immense pressure on the
                  university to increase funding for needy entrant. 50% of
                  them are not paying any family contribution - the
                  university and government are funding R22 000 per year.


                  Some key areas have been fundamentally important in the
                  success of the NSFAS:


                  *    The creation of the NSFAS as a statutory body and
                       the subsequent establishment of its Board with
                       representatives from higher education stakeholders
                       and the community.


                  *    The NSFAS loan recovery system and the quality of
                       the administrative systems.


                  *    The involvement of the Financial Aid
                       Services/Bureaux of Tertiary Institutions in the
                       administration of NSFAS loans is important. Financial
                       Aid Officers process enquiries and applications forms
                       from potential students. This can involve dealing
                       with more than 1 000 students per officer.


                  *    The NSFAS in consultation with Financial Aid
                       Officers designed a tool called "The Means Test",
                       which enables them to determine the relative
                       financial need of any student applicant. This is very
                       helpful in the administration and selection of
                       students.


              (b) Financial Aid Budget for 2001
                  The allocated budget for the NSFAS is R56 million,
                  divided as follows: Bursaries - R5 million (needy
                  students); scholarships - R12 million; and loans - R39,5
                  million.


              (c) Challenges


                  Selection criteria related to the NSFAS hinder students
                  from the poorest backgrounds from accessing tertiary
                  education. The more immediate challenges are:


                  *    Criteria focus on academic excellence and do not
                       take into account rural school and family background.
                       Alternative selection methods must be developed for
                       educationally disadvantaged students.


                  *    Hidden costs related to applying (e.g. access to
                       phones, the post, photocopying of documents and
                       direct costs (between R135 and R2 000 per
                       application) average about R500, which the poorest of
                       the poor cannot afford. A further R500 acceptance
                       deposit is required after academic selection; even
                       more if a residence deposit is required, which is
                       often the case with rural students.


                  *    A lack of consultation in respect of review and
                       implementation of NSFAS policy and procedures, taking
                       into consideration that the institution and officers
                       are the backbone of the NSFAS success story.


                  *    A lack of uniformity and monitoring of policies
                       instituted by the NSFAS, while the university has
                       aligned its financial aid policy to suit the
                       implementation of NSFAS policies and procedures.


                  *    Fund entrants only in the second semester.


                  *    Only half of the recommended maximum is given, that
                       has led to students withdrawing from studies before
                       completion. The maximum limit of R16 000 for 2001
                       according to government guidelines was not being
                       adhered to. In one institution the average size of an
                       award to an applicants is R3 000.


                  *    They do not use the means test to identify needy
                       students and determine award sizes.


              (d) Profile of South African student


                  White students live in houses close to the campus and are
                  studying away from home by choice. They are usually not
                  on financial aid, and invariably have part-time jobs as
                  waitressws, shop assistants, etc, to earn pocket money
                  and to contribute towards paying expenses. They are
                  independent and self-assured. They are found in all
                  disciplines, especially males in Science, Engineering and
                  Architecture. There is some racial friction in clubs and
                  societies, and to a limited extent in student government
                  bodies, where blacks dominate. They participate a lot in
                  sport.


                  Indian students live at home some distance from campus;
                  they travel by public transport or by family car. Many
                  privileged students have their own cars. Few are on
                  financial aid. The wealthy ones study away from home by
                  choice. They study and "play" in groups (good gender
                  mix), and hardly participate in clubs and societies or
                  student government bodies. They mainly study Commerce,
                  Law and Medicine (both genders).
                  95% of black students live in residences, mainly on
                  financial aid. They mainly study Law, Social Science and
                  Humanities. Females study Nursing and Teaching.
                  Especially the males participate in student government
                  bodies. There is a high attrition rate.


                  The white student population has decreased because of
                  perception that NSFAS funding targets the poorest. Middle-
                  class families experience problems to qualify for NSFAS
                  funding.


              (e) Student debt


                  When assisting the poorest of the poor with financial
                  aid, it is important to note that the Finance Division
                  has reported that more than 704 students owed more than
                  R100 000. The highest debt of any one student was
                  R177 128.


              (f) Existing administrative mechanisms for disbursement of
                  NSFAS funds


                  The university has not experienced any difficulties with
                  existing NSFAS administrative systems. The problem
                  alluded to in a letter from the Minister of Education to
                  the chairperson of the NSFAS Board (time between
                  registration and disbursement of funds) was not a serious
                  issue, as, according to the university's assessment, the
                  scheme was being run in a very professional and highly
                  competent manner.


              (g) Size and coverage of loan


                  The maximum limit of R16 000 of an NSFAS loan did not
                  adequately accommodate the actual study costs experienced
                  by students at a residential university. Tuition and
                  accommodation fees alone could be near R20 000 at 2001
                  rates, while the full costs, books and other necessary
                  living expenses, could be nearer to R30 000. This clearly
                  prejudiced the neediest students, who required loan
                  funding from other sources to meet their obligations -
                  funding which might not be offered on the favourable
                  terms and repayments conditions applicable to NSFAS
                  awards. A loan should be able to cover all fees at any of
                  the institutions.


                  They have received petitions from students who were
                  unable to repay loans due to unemployment, owing to them
                  being black-listed by credit bureaux.


              (h) Eligibility criteria


                  Based on their experience, they would like attention to
                  be given to the following:


                  *    Expand the range of post-graduate courses for which
                       NSFAS awards may be made, while acknowledging the
                       commitment of the NSFAS to assist talented and needy
                       students to enter tertiary institutions.


                  *    Consider making awards to permanent residents who
                       are not South African citizens. The restriction
                       prejudices students from other African countries who
                       have South Africa as their home and have been
                       accorded permanent resident status.


                  *    Staff and students have experienced that while the
                       most needy students benefit greatly from the
                       application of the means test, certain categories of
                       students are placed in a difficult position - small
                       families with an income above R50 000 (often single
                       parents with one breadwinner) often find that
                       assessed funds are beyond their reach, and that they
                       are effectively ineligible for funding.


                  Eligibility criteria should look at funding postgraduate
                  students, in accordance with the National Plan outlined
                  by the Minister.


                  There must be uniformity in the monitoring and
                  implementation of the policy at all institutions, and
                  NSFAS policies should be be reviewed continuously.


              (i) Targeting priority fields of study


                  According to Rev Ngomane, it will be more appropriate and
                  more effective for institutions themselves, rather than
                  the NSFAS, to target priority fields of study in line
                  with national policy. The discretion and flexibility that
                  will be needed to successfully implement this aspect of
                  national policy, would be very difficult to accommodate
                  if driven by a centralised funding agency such as the
                  NSFAS.


         6. Excellence and relevance in research - official view by Prof S
              S Abdool Karim


              (a) Research grants and contracts


                  The increase in grants is built largely on the
                  university's reputation and on donations attracted by it:
                  1995 - R4 million; 1996 - R50 million; 1997 - R65
                  million; 1998 - R83 million; 1999 - R105 million; and
                  2000 - R165 million. International research grants
                  amounted to R30 million.


              (b) Research strategy


                  In response to a rapid changing research environment,
                  their research support strategy reflects the imperatives
                  of the South African national system of innovation within
                  which the higher education system is located.


                  The university's research committee provides support to:


                  *    Outstanding academics that undertake high quality
                       basic and applied research and other creative work
                       that produces academic publications or their
                       recognised equivalent, like Dr N Ggaleni, Prof P
                       Berjak (on seed technology); Prof J Moodley (on
                       mothers dying during child birth because of
                       hypertension); and Prof K Durrheim (racism and
                       identity - geographies of racial exclusions).


                  *    The centre of research excellence, which enjoys
                       national and international recognition and draws on
                       researchers in a broad range of disciplines across
                       the university.


                  *    Increased investment in attracting, retaining and
                       training young academics to provide a new generation
                       of researchers.


                  *    Research with community partners.


                  Collaborations such as these strengthen the research
                  ethos because they contribute to the university's
                  commitment to socially responsive science and
                  scholarships. They are now trying to address local demand
                  to develop new knowledge.


              (c) HIV/AIDS


                  They actively support AIDS research, both through the
                  Africa Centre for Population Studies and Reproductive
                  Health and the Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research
                  Division. It has been noted with concern that HIV/AIDS
                  will have a serious impact on the ability of a large
                  number of people to access higher education. The age
                  group 18 to 24, traditional cohort of university
                  students, is seriously at risk and disadvantaged
                  communities particularly will be affected. There is a
                  great deal of student awareness programmes on the
                  pandemic.


     G.     University of the Witwatersrand - 6 August 2001


         1. Official overview by Vice-Chancellor, Prof N Reid


              Prof Reid joined WITS in 2001. The institution's priority is
              transformation and it has made progress, particularly with
              staff. They are working on schemes to fast-track the
              appointment of blacks to managerial positions. 50% of academic
              appointments have been blacks, but they were appointed to
              middle management. There are vacancies in some faculties but
              WITS is struggling to get South Africans to fill them (e.g.
              they are looking for a Zoology lecturer with a Ph D, but most
              applicants are from Asia).


              WITS is committed to supplementing and assisting disadvantaged
              students and to ensuring that this be accessible to them. 57%
              of the students are black and 47% are female. 70% come from
              Gauteng and 30% from outside. There are students from SADC
              countries and from the rest of Africa. They hope to expand and
              admit students from beyond Africa so as to embrace the spirit
              of globalisation. The curriculum has to incorporate
              Africanism, bearing in mind the colonialism that Africa had
              experienced.


              (a) Financial assistance


                  WITS has received R27 million from the government for
                  2000-01.


              (b) Bridging programmes


                  WITS has for many years been concerned about student
                  access to various faculties and about problems that
                  students from a disadvantaged background experience when
                  they are accepted into the university. This has resulted
                  in a number of bridging programmes, some of which were
                  initiated 25 years ago. These programmes were initially
                  designed to bridge the great divide between school and
                  university. The bridging courses served the purpose and
                  helped many students who had been admitted.


                  More recently, with the changing demographics of WITS'
                  student population, the fact that there were many
                  students from a disadvantaged background and a very poor
                  primary and secondary educational system, WITS realised
                  that there was an urgent need to reassess student access
                  to a tertiary education qualification. The faculties were
                  restructured and reduced from nine to five.


              (c) Faculties


                  The five new faculties are:


                  Commerce, Law and Management
                  Engineering and the Built Environment
                  Health Sciences
                  Humanities, Social Sciences and Education
                  Science


                  Each faculty has educational officers who establish
                  mechanisms to facilitate and allow students into their
                  academic programmes, students who would not automatically
                  gain access because of their secondary school
                  achievements.


         2. Commerce, Law and Management


              Mathematics and Science are entrance requirements for B Com
              Accounting. Few students enroll for this degree. Those who do
              not qualify to study B Com Accounting, are allowed to do a two-
              year bridging course.


              (a) Commerce Development Programmes


                  Since 1996, the Commerce Faculty has experienced
                  significant change in the constitution of its student
                  body. Increasing numbers of African, Coloured and Indian
                  students are being admitted, some of whom do not meet the
                  automatic entry requirements and a number of whom are
                  from previously disadvantaged educational backgrounds.


                  The Commerce Development Programmes unit (CDP unit) was
                  formally established in 1997 to facilitate and co-
                  ordinate the anticipated transformation in academic
                  development needs of both students and staffing of the
                  faculty. Thus far it has accommodated about 430 students,
                  registered for the extended curriculum B Com degree. The
                  registration figure for the Commerce Skills course for
                  2001 was 81 students.


              (b) Graduation rate of CB402 students: 1997 intake


                  Data was collected and collaborated in a longitudinal
                  study of students registered for CB402 for the first time
                  in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The first CDP-extended
                  curriculum students completed their four-year degrees in
                  2000. The student intake for CB402 in 1997 was 113.
                  According to statistics supplied, 14 graduated, 64
                  dropped out, 12 students were excluded, 11 moved to other
                  faculties and 18 were still completing their degrees.


              (c) Extended Curriculum B Com degree
                  In contrast to other tertiary CDP initiatives, a bridging
                  course for previously educationally disadvantaged
                  students seeking entry to the faculty was not considered
                  appropriate, hence a formal four-year extended curriculum
                  B Com degree structure has been introduced. It is
                  structured in such a way that first-level courses are
                  split over two years. During the first year, a student is
                  required to take a specially designed course in
                  Commercial Skills.


                  The CDP assists with academic development of the annual
                  intake of extended curriculum students. It also functions
                  as a research and advisory resource for academic staff in
                  teaching departments to address mainstream teaching and
                  learning problems.


              (d) Entry requirements


                  To meet the automatic admission requirements for B Com,
                  an applicant needs:


                  *    A total of 23+ points for matric subjects.


                  *    Mathematics at higher grade or 60% (C) at standard
                       grade.


                  To be accepted for the extended curriculum degree, an
                  applicant needs:


                  *    A total of 17+ points for matric subjects.


                  *    To have come from a previously disadvantaged
                       educational background. Preference is given to
                       applicants from ex-DET schools.


                  *    Those who do not meet the minimum mathematics
                       requirements, are required to register for and pass
                       Foundation Mathematics, a course designed to provide
                       students with the knowledge and confidence to proceed
                       to computational Mathematics.


              (e) School of Law


                  The School of Law does not have a formal bridging
                  programme, but offers an extended LLB to a limited number
                  of disadvantaged students. This LLB is normally offered
                  over four years. Courses offered are in line with the
                  demand in the economy.


         3. Engineering and the Built Environment


              Learners are admitted into this faculty on the basis of their
              Grade 12 results. Common requirements for admission include
              mathematics and competency in English. With most of the
              schools, Physical Science is a further requirement for
              admission.
              The faculty ensures that learners from disadvantaged
              backgrounds have a wide range of career opportunities.
              Selection and placement tests and interviews are held by the
              faculty to ensure that alternative admission is administered.
              If learners have lower points than required, this alternative
              admission system allows them to enter a different school in
              the faculty.


              In some schools though, they can enter the Foundation
              Programme directly, while in others they can enter into the
              main stream directly and then be directed to the Foundation
              Programme after the first series of tests written in April.
              These programmes take the form of an extended curriculum,
              where the first year of academic study is extended over two
              years with a wide range of academic development programmes to
              develop competencies.


              The faculty does recognise that Mathematics has a restricted
              number of candidates, especially from disadvantaged
              backgrounds, for entry. It also recognises that Mathematics at
              secondary school level has not necessarily provided the
              required competencies for academic success. At the beginning
              the success rate of the special selection tests was 23%; now
              it has increased to 60%, especially for students from
              disadvantaged communities.


         4. Health Sciences


              There is a new curriculum for medical students doing practical
              in Primary Health Care. Arrangements have been made with North
              West, the Northern Province and Mpumalanga.


              (a) Problems experienced


                  *    Students from a disadvantaged background are not
                       prepared to deal with the high pressures of tertiary
                       institutions.


                  *    First- and second-year students experience a 50%
                       failure rate, due to the fact that they have a poor
                       background in Mathematics and Science. WITS has had
                       to change its entry requirements to medical school
                       and this has changed the number of years one has to
                       study for a medical degree to four intensive years.
                       The curriculum has been changed as well.


                  *    Students from disadvantaged schools have difficulty
                       in asking questions in a large lecture hall. This
                       makes it difficult to pick up problems they may
                       experience. WITS has decided to make group small -
                       about 8 students per class.


                  *    WITS has developed contact with hospitals in
                       Mpumalanga and the Northern Province for graduates to
                       work there.


              (b) College of Science


                  The College of Science was started in 1991. Every year
                  about 130 students are admitted to the stream that leads
                  to Science. The two-year programme also offers computer
                  skills, library skills, etc. More students can be
                  admitted, but most students do not do well in
                  Mathematics.


         5. Humanities, Social Sciences and Education


              Entry requirements in this faculty have been changed.
              Curriculum specialists are located in the different faculties,
              who are involved in curricula review and restructuring of
              education diplomas and degrees. Many of the staff are involved
              in producing text books across the spectrum.


              Five computer centres have been set up to allow teachers and
              students to have access to computers. Teachers have been
              allowed to upgrade themselves in their area of study or
              interest. For example, teachers without matric (PTC) but with
              many years of working experience may study certain courses.


              Applicants older than 23 who do not meet the entry
              requirements, may study for the four-year degree or three-year
              diploma.


         6. Faculty of Science


              The faculty has the following branches: Biological Science;
              Molecular Science; Geo-Science; and Pure Mathematics.


              An E in higher grade Mathematics is the entry requirement.
              Should applicant not have this, a special selection test is
              offered to allow them to gain access. Those who pass the
              selection test, are interviewed and potential is identified.
              60 to 80 students are allowed to study through a foundation
              programme to improve their success rate.


              WITS encourages organisations like Eskom to allow their
              bursars to do a two-year postgraduate degree in Engineering
              while being paid 75% of their salary.


         7. University Institutional Forum


              The forum has about 45 members (four members of the SRC; SASCO
              is also represented), and meets once a quarter or whenever
              there is a need. The term of office is three years. It advises
              the Council on issues affecting the university i.e.
              transformation and HIV/AIDS.


              Most students are not aware of how the forum can assist them.
              It is planning on improving communication with students.


              Plan of action


              The Forum needs:


                    To redefine the university's role.


                    To improve its communication strategy.


                    To improve staff morale.


         8. Student Representative Council


              The SRC has 15 members, five white, six black and four others.
              Issues that students deal with, are different from issues
              dealt by students in previous years. Some of these are
              HIV/AIDS, second language learning and media on campus. The
              SRC has delivered on their manifesto of promises. It has
              solved some of student governance problems. Students have been
              involved in restructuring and transforming the university. The
              SRC also ensures that the university does not exclude
              students.


         9. HIV/AIDS


              The SRC initiated the HIV/AIDS tests at WITS. Members of the
              Council have gone for HIV/AIDS tests but have not released
              their results. Their main goal is to have students go for
              HIV/AIDS tests. Enough condoms have been distributed and the
              university has been involved in formulating an HIV/AIDS
              policy.


         10.     Sexual harassment


              WITS has employed a part-time sexual harassment officer; they
              cannot afford a full-time one. Those who feel that they have
              been sexually harassed, can consult the office. There are
              statistics available that suggest sexual harassment and rapes
              do occur.


         11.     Language


              WITS is addressing the language problem and foundation courses
              are offered for disadvantaged students. A language survey to
              determine the language problem experienced by students has
              been conducted. The Department of Education does not consider
              sign language an entrant requirement.
         12.     Racism


              Students are not willing to come forward and report incidences
              of racism, as they are scared of being victimised. WITS does
              not allow initiation of students.


         13.     Postgraduate students


              They do not have a platform from which to raise their
              concerns, and they do not receive adequate funding for their
              studies.


         14.     Key people from bridging and foundation programmes


              The needs of the students who do not meet entry requirements,
              are addressed. Students who experience personal and academic
              problems, are counselled.


         15. Unversity Research Committee


              Research in South Africa is funded by Science Councils. WITS
              is trying to identify black women academics. The research
              committee has proposed a capacity development scheme to
              support and promote blacks, women and the youth.


              Challenges in increased involvement of Blacks/women


              Academics are not paid well and this makes it difficult to
              attract them to the university. The pressure is on black
              graduates to contribute to their families financially once
              they are qualified.


              The Faculty of Science, followed by Engineering, produces a
              number of publications. WITS has a system of senior
              mentorship, where experienced scientists are funded from
              outside to train young scientists. The Nuclear Physics
              Institute has signed agreements for exchange students with
              Zimbabwe.
              It is difficult to access funds for a publication, as you have
              to be on a list of Research Journals, which have not been
              updated for five years.


              The Faculty of Engineering is fully committed to research, but
              it is difficult for the university in general to retain black
              students to enter postgraduate studies, as they prefer to work
              after completing their junior degree, due to the fact that
              their parents or families expect them to pay towards the
              studies of siblings still at school. They either join the
              public or private sector because education institutions offer
              lower salaries.


         16.     National Plan Co-ordinating Committee - merging of
              institutions


              The institution is not scared of change, and for the past
              three years has engaged in transformation. Informal
              discussions are taking place on a possible merger. However,
              international experience shows that a merger of institutions
              succeeds when there is enough time to do it, but does not
              succeed when forced. It has shown that institutions like WITS
              should strengthen its strategic alliance rather than merge.


              WITS does acknowledge that Johannesburg needs more than one
              university, but is not sure whether a merger will address this
              need. The merger could be done at programme level. Their
              concern is that if pushed to merger, they will end up not
              addressing their problems and will not be able to focus on
              transformation. Nevertheless, WITS is willing to engage in
              policy discussions.


         17.     Postgraduate Association


              Previously there was no way for postgraduate students to
              channel their grievances. The Postgraduate Association does
              not have a seat in the Senate. There are not enough funds to
              promote research at WITS, as the government is no longer
              funding the institution properly. This makes it impossible for
              WITS to sustain itself without proper promotion of research.


         18.     National Student Financial Aid Scheme


              For many years funds have been allocated to needy students
              registering at institutions of higher learning. Since the
              inception of the NSFAS, WITS has administered these funds in
              accordance with criteria laid down by the NSFAS as well as
              WITS's General Rules of Practice for awarding University
              Administered Bursaries and Loans (for 2001).


              (a) Size allocation per student


                  The maximum allocation to each student has increased
                  steadily each year from R10 000 in 1996 to R16 000 in
                  2001. The maximum income level has been increased to R130
                  000 per year to assist middle-income students who face
                  financial constraints. Lower income levels were from
                  R10 000 to R15 000 per year. This enabled the extremely
                  needy students to be assisted.


              (b) Eligibility


                  *    Students cannot access NSFAS funds unless they are
                       registered. It is the Department of Education that
                       has set this criteria. However, WITS does waver
                       registration fees if a students is on the NSFAS,
                       while other universities do not allow that.


                  *    The duration of financial assistance is equal to the
                       length of the degree plus one year (up to a maximum
                       of seven years in the case of medical students).


                  *    In certain circumstances where a student has already
                       qualified for an undergraduate degree, he or she may
                       not receive additional funding. However, WITS and the
                       Oppenheimer Trust have established a loan scheme to
                       be administered by the NSFAS.


                  *    Difficulty is experienced by students who do not
                       qualify for maximum funds but require additional
                       funding for accommodation and subsistence. If a
                       student is in a residence, the allowance pays for
                       accommodation, so there are no surplus funds
                       available for subsistence. If the student uses
                       private accommodation, the allowance is used to
                       payment the rent, and therefore no subsistence is
                       available.


                  *    In 2001 there were roll-over funds, which assisted
                       690 students who otherwise would have been excluded.


              (c) Disabled students
                  WITS encourages access of disabled students, regardless
                  of a lack of resources.


                  *    These students experience specific problems as a
                       result of their disabilities. In most cases they are
                       enrolled on special/extended curricula which require
                       that the period of study and thus the loan period be
                       extended. The difficulty comes in where a student has
                       surpassed the number of years allowed but has not
                       finished the degree. Although they are denied
                       funding, it is felt that a disabled student should be
                       assisted to study further. However, there have been
                       no funds allocated for this purpose. In addition,
                       disabled students often require specialised material,
                       which at this stage are not funded by the NSFAS.
                  *    The Dean of Student Affairs discussed these points
                       with Mr R Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of the
                       NSFAS, who agreed to take the matter up with the
                       NSFAS Board.


                  *    Disabled students are assisted by the university's
                       Roll-over Loan Programme. This programme was started
                       in 1993 to assist needy students on financial aid who
                       were unable to pay fees not covered by their
                       packages. Since then the programme has grown from
                       assisting only a handful of students to assisting 690
                       students in 2000-01. It includes the granting of
                       additional NSFAS loans and is aimed at students who
                       are unable to pay the balance of their fees at the
                       end of the academic year. Provided they have passed
                       and have not received the maximum NSFAS loans, these
                       students' applications are reassessed and they are
                       granted additional loan funding according to their
                       financial need rating. Foreign students, including
                       those with refugee status, SADC students (unless they
                       become South African citizens) and part-time students
                       are not eligible for loans.


                  The NSFAS requires that all students make some
                  contribution towards their costs. Because of this
                  requirement, all students applying for the Roll-over Loan
                  Programme must have made a contribution towards their
                  fees accounts, according to their individual
                  circumstances. WITS also provides a Service Bursary
                  Scheme, whereby students may work in departments within
                  the university to assist them to make their own
                  contributions. Wits also receive donated funds and funds
                  from the University Council. These funds are used to top
                  up student packages with bursaries. Students are not
                  required to repay this portion to the university.


     H.     Potchefstroom University (PU) - 7 August 2001


         1. Traditional ethos and transformation


              The School of Theology was founded in 1869 in Burgersdorp. In
              1919 the institution became a University College for Christian
              Higher Education (CHE). It became a University of South Africa
              College in 1921, being called a University College in 1951.
              The university has had one satellite campus since 1966. More
              blacks started studying at PU since 1967. Residences were
              opened to all races in 1990. There are about 2 000 students on
              the Vaal Triangle Campus.


         2. Vision


              A university of high quality with a Christian foundation,
              entrepreneurally orientated and responsive to the requirements
              of the age, the country and the nation.


         3. Transformation


              The transformation process started early in the 1990s. Prior
              to 1994 they met with different stakeholders, and various
              issues were discussed. Before transformation took place, there
              was tension and uncertainty among staff, and there is still
              tension.


              In the mid-90s the composition of the council was changed, as
              it was dominated by whites. It contained 17 white males. 30%
              of the members were internal members and 70% were external.
              Three were Senate members.


              In 1993 the council consisted of one principal, four vice-
              principals, two Senate members, one employee, one student and
              external members. An agreement was reached to enlarge the
              council to 23 members, consisting of 14 white males, seven
              black males and two white females.


              In 1999 further changes with regard to gender and the number
              of employees were made in respect of the council. It consisted
              of 17 whites, six blacks and five females.


              Principal - 1; Vice-Principal - 2; Management Committee;
              Senate - 2; Other employees - 1; Institutional Forum - 1;
              Students - 2.


              (a) Student numbers


                  1919-1965 - students numbered about 2 000. In 2001 there
                  were 13 327 students at PU and the Vaal Triangle - 75%
                  white, 25% black, 43% males and 57% females. 45% are from
                  North West and 55% from other provinces and other
                  countries. Postgraduate students are 3 490 (about 26%)
                  and undergraduate students are 9 837 (about 74%).
              (b) Massification


                  The number of students increased as the years went by and
                  telematic learning systems have been developed. PU's
                  telematics results have been better than the results of
                  students studying on campus (contact students). They are
                  also better than those of students studying at UNISA,
                  probably due to the fact that the majority of distance
                  learners are mature and dedicated. Telematic, distant and
                  contact students all write the same examinations.


                  PU has been used to develop a telematics learning system,
                  and its learning centres quite often operate in concert
                  with other institutions to enhance education. These
                  institutions are all over South Africa: Northern Province
                  - 7; Mpumalanga - 21; North West - 13; Northern Cape - 5;
                  Eastern Cape - 12; Western Cape - 12; KwaZulu-Natal - 12;
                  Gauteng - 1.


                  This programme is meant for students who, for whatever
                  reason, cannot attend residential institutions. PU is
                  trying to attract more black students to balance with the
                  country's demographics. Black students who qualify for
                  admission are not turned away. PU does not prevent
                  students from other denominations (not Christian) to
                  study there. They are satisfied with the results of
                  telematic learning systems, and has taken steps to ensure
                  that private providers make the programme a success.


                  PU has nine faculties and 13 research focus areas. They
                  also offer outreach programmes - postgraduates engaged in
                  community services. Research is conducted to assist
                  communities in respect of nutrition, legal aid, etc. The
                  Theology Faculty has more black students than any other
                  faculty.


                  Twice a year school teachers enroll for diploma and
                  postgraduate diploma courses offered by PU to upgrade
                  them in Mathematics and Science. About 1 000 black
                  teachers have been upgraded by them over the past four
                  years. These teachers are allowed to use the university's
                  laboratory facilities, as most of their schools do not
                  have laboratories.


              (c) Institutional culture


                  The language medium of PU is Afrikaans. About 6 000
                  students study in English. 90% of all textbooks are in
                  English and lectures are in Afrikaans. All examination
                  papers are in Afrikaans and English, and students may
                  answer questions in the language of their choice. In the
                  Vaal Triangle, 50% of the lectures are in Afrikaans and
                  50% in English.


                  Prof Zibi organised morning classes to teach management
                  Setswana, which helped them to be sensitive to other
                  languages. PU is opposed to the merger of institutions.


                  They have a negotiated statute, which came about as a
                  result of transformation. The statute will be revisited
                  in some technical respects once the private acts are
                  scrapped. Lectures have never been disrupted due to
                  unrest.


              (d) Disabilities


                  PU has developed material to enable blind students to
                  study. Different buildings have been made to cater for
                  persons with disability (e.g. toilets, off-ramps, lecture
                  halls, etc). Disabled staff members who cannot drive or
                  use the computer, are assisted.


              (e) Language


                  PU attempts to ensure that language is not a barrier for
                  students. A language-assisting facility has been
                  installed to assist students with reading skills.
                  Computer courses are offered for all students. The
                  university feels very strongly about Afrikaans, but will
                  not exclude or discriminate against other languages.
                  There are students trained to assist students who cannot
                  cope with the content of courses.


              (f) Satellite campus: telematic/distance programmes


                  Most students attending the satellite campus and distance
                  programmes are working people with their own families to
                  support, and thus cannot afford to attend full-time
                  lectures.


              (g) Student affairs


                  There is a high level of representation of students on
                  different committees. PU regards students as equals in
                  all committees they are serving on. SRC members are
                  members of the Senate, the Executive Council and the
                  Council. The management does not interfere with student
                  politics, and students independently deal with their
                  affairs.


              (h) SRC


                  SASCO was not part of the meeting, as its members were
                  picketing outside the premises when the delegation
                  arrived. The delegation met with members of the Vaal
                  Triangle's SRC and PU's SRC. There was tension on campus
                  when the SRC chairperson started studying at Vaal
                  Triangle. No one was prepared to address issues. Change
                  began when students started questioning what was
                  happening.


                       Finances


                       Many measures are in place to assist students
                       financially. It has always been a problem for
                       students to pay for registration.


                       Language


                       Students tried to establish a forum to discuss issues
                       - a student parliament. This parliament sits once a
                       term, depending on the need. Some programmes are
                       offered in English. Evening lectures are mainly for
                       part-time students, but full-time students are
                       allowed to attend them. Study material is in both
                       languages. Sometimes, at Vaal Triangle, students are
                       allowed to decide on the language they prefer to be
                       lectured in. They participate in lectures in a
                       language of their choice.


                       Each campus has its own SRC. Potch has 18 portfolios
                       and Vaal Triangle eight. The student body has eight
                       portfolios, among others Sport, Culture, PRO,
                       Secretary, Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson. It is
                       directly involved in assisting students.


                       NSFAS


                       Funds are only made available to students after they
                       have registered at Potch or Vaal Triangle. Students
                       cannot access funds if their fees have not been paid.
                       Students do not abuse the NSFAS, as the NSFAS targets
                       needy students. Vaal Triangle is a small campus and
                       it is easy to detect needy students. Both SRCs assist
                       in identifying needy students.


                       Residences


                       At Vaal Triangle, residence students are allowed to
                       stay where they want. Most of them socialise with
                       students of their own culture. Black students (five
                       years ago) pressurised management to be accommodated
                       in their own residences, but it was refused.
                       Allegations exist that there is an element of racial
                       discrimination at university residences. At Potch
                       students are allowed to stay where they want, taking
                       cognisance of the fact that mono-cultural residences
                       have not been allowed to develop.


                       HIV/AIDS


                       There is a support group that deals with AIDS. There
                       are no condoms available on campus, as the
                       distribution of condoms is regarded as contrary to a
                       Christian value system.


              (i) Dropouts


                  PU does not have readily available statistics on the
                  number of academic dropouts. It has no record of students
                  who dropped out because of financial reasons. Those who
                  usually drop out after the first year, do not report or
                  come back, which makes it difficult to trace them.


              (j) Orientation/initiation


                  Initiation is done in a fashion that is comfortable to
                  the students - it is a programme owned by the students.


         3. NSFAS


              The Financial Support Services Department at PU is the vital
              link between the NSFAS and students.


              (a) State of NSFAS IN 2001


                  In 2001 PU received R14 133 522, and R11 209 355 was
                  allocated. NSFAS 2001: R11 140 000; NSFAS Teachers
                  Education 2001: R2 484 522; NSFAS x 2000: R412 000; NSFAS
                  Thintana 2001: R97 000.


                  Total number of students assisted: 1 096; population
                  distribution: 65% whites and 35% blacks receive the
                  funds. 20% of black students and 7% of white students
                  receive NSFAS funds. 96% of black first-year students
                  studying towards a degree in education receive NSFAS
                  funds for teacher education.


              (b) Management of NSFAS at PU
                  The NSFAS is managed on a three-system approach -
                  marketing, production and financial strategy. To market
                  the NSFAS, the university:


                  *    Advertises in the student newspaper, Die Wapad.


                  *    Holds meetings with Deans, Directors of Schools,
                       lecturers, house committee members and the SRC to
                       sensitise on financially needy students.


                  *    Uses the Internet, e-mail and groupwise to inform
                       students who have access to electronic media.


                  *    Liaises with the Financial Department (Accounts) to
                       identify students with financial problems.


                  *    Makes first-year students aware of the NSFAS.
                  *    Liaises with individual students to identify more
                       financially needy students.


                  Students who receive NSFAS funds, receive funds that
                  cover all academic costs. PU does not return roll-over
                  funds to the NSFAS, as they are aware that at the
                  beginning of every year there are students who need
                  financial assistance. These students are allowed to
                  access roll-over NSFAS funds for registration. Only
                  students who meet the academic requirements, can access
                  these funds. PU allocates between R9 000 and R12 000 to
                  each student, but priority is given to the needy. The
                  NSFAS is satisfied with the way in which their funds are
                  administered.


         2. Entry requirements, bridging programme and publication of
              requirements for access


              (a) PU offers a Technical College Programme for students who
                  do not meet entry requirements. These access programmes
                  are offered in Rustenburg, Vereeniging, Van der Bijl
                  Park, Springs, Benoni, Potchefstroom and Sasolburg.


              (b) They offer Saturday classes (and has been doing so for a
                  number of years) to assist Grade 12 pupils to pass so
                  that they may meet the university's entry requirements.


              (c) PU has Student Counselling Services responsible for
                  selecting students, career guidance using psychometric
                  tests, assisting students to cope with their studies
                  psychologically, and offering special administrative
                  tests for students who do not meet entry requirements.


              Students who qualify to be admitted to study Engineering have
              a minimum of 21 points. Students who do not qualify are
              allowed to write a special admission test in Mathematics.
              Those who do not pass the test, are allowed to study a two-
              year course in order to register. About 20 students are
              allowed to register for a one-year course that will enable
              them to study Engineering. This course is expensive and costs
              the university a lot of money. Tests are used to select
              students to study Pharmacy, Theology and Social Work.


         3. SADC students


              PU does admit students from SADC countries, but their matric
              results have to be evaluated by the Matriculation Board. These
              students are from Zaire, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The
              university has students from Korea and Britain, who study
              through telematics. PU has prepared study guidelines that
              assist distance-learning students. Distance-learning
              programmes are good programmes, not secondary.
     I.     University of the North (UNIN) - 8 August 2001


         UNIN is a rural university within a predominantly black
         population. The ratio is 99% black, other races making up the
         remaining 1%. 55% of the student body are female.


         1. Academic sector


              There are more females in the top managerial levels. There are
              more males (321) than females (141), more blacks (296) than
              whites (147), and only five coloureds and four Indians on the
              permanent staff of the main campus. On 1 July 2001, a new
              academic structure was established.


              (a) Programmes


                  UNIN has various formative degrees and diplomas in the
                  following directions:


                  Arts and Health Sciences
                  Humanities and Social Sciences
                  Law
                  Agriculture, Health and Natural Sciences
                  Management Sciences


                  UNIN offers programme-based study directions within two
                  faculties. These programmes will be housed in schools:


                  Faculty of Arts and Humanities


                  Arts
                  Social Sciences
                  Education
                  Law
                  Management and Leadership Studies


                  Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences


                  Natural and Environmental Sciences
                  Mathematical Sciences, Computer Studies and Information
                  Technology
                  Health Sciences
                  Applied Agriculture Sciences
                  Mining and Manufacturing Engineering
                  Research Development


                  A programme-based study direction was developed in
                  response to the needs in community - UNIN has four
                  research units. To date the focus has been on
                  undergraduate programmes. Postgraduate programmes as well
                  as research have always taken a backseat. UNIN now
                  intends to increase efforts towards greater student
                  intakes at postgraduate level. There are still more males
                  than females, and UNIN wants to put mechanisms in place
                  to attract more females into the research arena.


                  UNIN has experienced a drastic drop in overall student
                  enrolment and is now in the process of developing
                  strategies to deal with the situation. It identified the
                  following as factors that caused the dramatic drop in
                  enrolment:


                  *    Instability within the institution as a result of
                       the active involvement of its student body in
                       national politics.


                  *    Lack of viable marketable academic programmes.


                  *    The opening of alternative institutions of higher
                       learning, especially white universities and
                       technikons, since 1994.


                  *    The development of an increased interest in
                       technikons, compared to universities. Lack of
                       adequate financial support for students in need,
                       especially first-time entrant and postgraduate
                       levels.


                  *    Low matriculation results, especially at university
                       entry level in the Northern Province.


                  *    Lack of student retention mechanisms.


                  *    Lack of competitive recruitment strategies.


                  *    Poor image of the institution.


              (b) Disabled students


                  UNIN caters for disabled students and partially sighted
                  students. It has the best equipped and running disabled
                  students unit, which will accommodate the needs of the
                  disabled. Plans are afoot to put up a special building to
                  house the unit. Physical facilities around the main
                  campus have been improved to meet the needs of this
                  sector of the student community.


                  UNIN has a good programme for the deaf, visually and
                  mobile impaired students. Funds have been raised to build
                  a unit for disabled students. However, UNIN cannot afford
                  to buy furniture for them, and appeal to the government
                  to assist.


              (c) Recruitment


                  To attract students, UNIN advertises in both the printed
                  and the electronic media. It is difficult for the
                  university to attract postgraduate students, as it cannot
                  afford to offer bursaries in competition with traditional
                  white universities.


              (d) NSFAS - implementation and limitations


                  *    Ideally the funding should enable needy students to
                       overcome their financial difficulties and further
                       their education. Regrettably this is not the case, as
                       the NSFAS is not able to fund students to the full
                       tune of what they require, since there are minimum
                       and maximum allocations prescribed by the NSFAS
                       Board. This means then it does not cater for all
                       students' needs. Since its inception, the NSFAS has
                       never been able to pay all fees for that particular
                       year for students because of the limited funding and
                       the number of students who qualify for financial
                       assistance according to NSFAS requirements.


                  *    NSFAS funds are allocated to 60% females and 40%
                       males. Students who do not meet NSFAS requirements
                       are not allowed access to the funds. NSFAS
                       allocations are made after a student has registered.


                  *    The success rate of students receiving NSFAS funds
                       is about 60%.


              (e) NSFAS -implication for UNIN


                  UNIN depends mainly on the NSFAS to fund students, as it
                  does not have reserves like other institutions,
                  especially historically advantaged institutions. It has
                  been a trend that, since the establishment of the NSFAS,
                  UNIN has not been able to pay the allocation prescribed
                  by the NSFAS because of limited funding. The amount
                  allocated to an institution is divided by the number of
                  students who qualify for financial assistance. For
                  example, in the academic year 2000, the maximum
                  allocation recommended by the NSFAS was R14 600, but the
                  maximum allocation that the university could make
                  available, was R8 500 per student. This amount does not
                  even cover the fees fully, let alone meals and book
                  allowance.


                  The fact that students do not get an allowance for books,
                  could lead to them failing or dropping out.


              (f) Means test


                  *    Most institutions use the means test; others use
                       their internal local software as the cut-off point
                       for income. This creates a problem in a sense that
                       the means test is not compulsory, and thus funding to
                       students is not uniform.


                  *    It is not clear whether funding is really received
                       by deserving (poor) students or not, since students
                       do not provide true information about their parents'
                       or guardians' income status. This makes it difficult
                       to assess the authenticity of information given.
                       There is no system which institutions could use to
                       access the parents/guardians information. Most
                       students submit pension slips, and UNIN depends on
                       these submissions to select students.
                  *    Students studying for a two-year diploma at UNIN, do
                       not qualify for financial assistance. They struggle
                       to get financial assistance, as UNIN does not have
                       funds to allocate to them.


                  *    The NSFAS sponsors undergraduate students and only a
                       few postgraduate degrees and diplomas. UNIN has to
                       cater for students who do not qualify for NSFAS
                       funds.


              (g) UNIN'S contribution


                  UNIN has its own Student Financial Aid Trust, established
                  in 1996. The trust awards bursaries to needy students in
                  Pharmacy, Optometry, Agriculture, Natural Sciences,
                  Management Sciences and Medical Sciences. Since 1999, the
                  trust has allocated bursaries to the tune of R600 000. At
                  the time of the visit the trust hoped to raise R1 million
                  before the end of 2001.


              (h) Student Representative Assembly


                  *    Students are not happy with the way NSFAS funds are
                       allocated - these are allocated to students after
                       they have registered. This means that students who
                       cannot afford to pay registration fees, are unable to
                       access funds and are not admitted.


                  *    Funds (about R2 million) have been withdrawn from
                       UNIN because they were not utilised by the
                       university. UNIN's Finance Section did not have a
                       mechanism to allocate NSFAS funds to students. This
                       happened even though students were sent home because
                       they could not pay the registration fee.


                  *    Funding is allocated mostly to students studying
                       Science and Technology - students studying other
                       courses are neglected.


                  *    Most students are black.


                  *    UNIN has a programme to ensure that SADC students
                       are recruited and attracted.


                  *    The SRC is now referred to as the Student
                       Representative Assembly, and its constitution has
                       been changed.


                  *    There is no clear mechanism to ensure that
                       university debts paid by students go to the
                       university and not to lawyers.


                  *    UNIN is apprehensive of paying for first-year
                       students, as there is no guarantee that those
                       students will get a 50% pass.
              (i) Administration and technical staff


                  *    Funding allocated to UNIN is not adequate, and thus
                       some students have to drop out.


                  *    About 4 000 students applied to study at UNIN, but
                       not all could register, as most of them could not
                       afford registration fees. This has resulted in a
                       significant drop in the numbers of students
                       registered. Some staff members had to be retrenched,
                       because there were not enough students to lecture.


                  *    UNIN is unable to attract students with good matric
                       results. It is only the funded traditional white
                       universities that are able to attract such students,
                       as they can offer them bursaries.


                  *    UNIN is unable to attract students of colour, as
                       meals offered at the univer+sity are not of good
                       quality.


                  *    300 Pharmacy applicants were turned away because
                       pharmacy laboratories were small and could not cater
                       for many students.


                  *    UNIN has 600 computers but not enough trainers to
                       train students, as there are not enough funds to pay
                       trainers.


              (j) Concerned Lecturers and Academic Staff Support Group
                  (CLASSG)


                  *    Students are unable to access the NSFAS for
                       registration. Most academically qualifying students
                       cannot afford to pay registration fees, which makes
                       it difficult for UNIN to attract academically viable
                       students.
                  *    UNIN offers a good bridging programme, UNIFY. The
                       Senate has agreed to expand the programme to other
                       fields of study.


                  *    UNIN adheres to the National Plan on Higher
                       Education.


                  *    Students registered in 2001 are committed in
                       studying because they are encouraged to make a
                       contribution towards their studies. They have to make
                       some payment to register.


                  *    Politicians should assist UNIN to improve its
                       culture of learning.


                  *    UNIN offers a community outreach programme -students
                       cannot graduate without doing community work.


                  *    UNIN conducts research for the government.
              (k) Entry requirements


                  It is important for students to understand the language
                  used in different courses. For example, students studying
                  Science have to attend a language course for Science to
                  enable them to understand the course. This course has
                  been offered since the 1970s. UNIN addresses issues of
                  language and culture in cases where the medium of
                  instruction is a second or third language.


         2. Visit to experimental farm - offical view by Prof Fritzgerald,
              Administrator: UNIN


              There is tension between UNIN and the Administrator. Prof
              Fritzgerald is working hard to ensure that this does not
              affect UNIN's functioning. According to him, the culture of
              learning has to be improved, and politicians could assist in
              this regard.


     J.     Recommendations


         1. In keeping with the objective of specialist schools, centres of
              excellence and a focused vision, the above-mentioned
              institutions should look at placing greater funding and
              resources in the particular speciality towards which they seem
              to be moving:


              (a) Peninsula Tecnikon is moving towards digital technology
                  and engineering, thus it should specialise and make this
                  their priority, with advanced courses being offered so
                  that they can produce not only computer operators but
                  also software and hardware technologists.


              (b) To protect the valuable work kept in the Research Centre
                  at the University of Fort Hare, it should be microfilmed
                  and digitised.


              (c) The funding formula for universities should be reviewed;
                  the current year enrolment should be used as a yardstick,
                  not the enrolment of two years ago. The formula should
                  also provide for financial assistance for needy students.


              (d) The Department of Education should review the formula for
                  funding institutions of higher learning with the aim to
                  find ways in which to address the neglect of previously
                  disadvantaged institutions and to empower them to fulfil
                  their missions.


              (e) Special financial assistance to UNITRA is of the essence
                  to upgrade their medical faculty.


              (f) The Department of Education should substantially increase
                  the NSFAS budget to accommodate more students and to
                  effectively and realistically open the doors of higher
                  learning.


              (g) As students from SADC countries are not eligible for NSFAS
                  funds, a clear policy in respect of assisting them should
                  be developed.


              (h) The University of the North needs to open a Mining
                  Engineering Department or Faculty, as the entire Northern
                  Province has a mining potential not fully utilised.


              (i) History as a discipline needs to be prioritised to realise
                  the authentic and correct history of our people in South
                  Africa.


              (j) African Languages need to be revitalised in our
                  institutions of higher learning.


              (k) The National Research Foundation should facilitate
                  research and training of postgraduate students at
                  historically disadvantaged institutions.


              (l) Special focus should be given to Potchefstroom University
                  in respect of language, gender, religion and
                  representativity in order to speed up the process of
                  transformation there.


     K.     Concluding remarks


         The Committee observed with appreciation the general stability in
         the institutions visited. There seems to be relative co-operation
         between stakeholders, with institutional forums working together
         well. Most of them seem to be making significant strides in
         keeping up with transformation policies. All agree that the NSFAS
         plays a big role in facilitating many students from poor
         communities to access institutions of higher learning.
