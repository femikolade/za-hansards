The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  I  know  hon
members have had to cut short their watching the soccer. We are going to  be
here until a quarter past eight. We could not delay our  meeting,  otherwise
members would have been here until a quarter past ten.  All  members  wanted
to  speak,  and  you  did  not  want  to  cut  your   speaking   time.   So,
unfortunately, you cannot have your cake and eat it.
                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


     hom vereenselwig met die standpunt van mnr  Leonard  Ramatlakane,  Wes-
     Kaapse Minister van Gemeenskapsveiligheid, naamlik dat mnr Tony Leon sy
     negatiewe uitlatings oor die Langa-polisie se betrokkenheid by  terreur
     wat gemik is teen die DA/DP óf staaf óf terugtrek.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting of  the
Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


     identifies itself  with  the  contention  of  Mr  Leonard  Ramatlakane,
     Western Cape Minister of Community Safety, namely  that  Mr  Tony  Leon
     should  either  prove  his  negative  statements  regarding  the  Langa
     police's involvement in terror levelled against the DA/DP, or  withdraw
     it.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, I give notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) condemns the blocking of a humanitarian  aid  mission  to  Palestine,
       headed by South Africa's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs;


  (2) believes  that  in  conflict  situations  efforts  to  alleviate  the
       humanitarian consequences of a crisis should be carried  out  without
       delay;


  (3) further believes that the actions of the  Israeli  government  is  in
       direct conflict with the observance and application of  international
       humanitarian law; and


  (4) calls on the Israeli government to observe internationally recognised
       humanitarian  principles  and  international  humanitarian  law,   by
       allowing the  South  African  humanitarian  aid  mission  to  proceed
       without delay.

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, I give notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) rejects with contempt  the  accusations  by  DA  leader,  Tony  Leon,
       against President Thabo Mbeki;


  (2) notes that the DA's attack against the President  is  devoid  of  any
       substance, and comes at a time when yet  another  corruption  scandal
       has rocked the DA, this time involving its  Western  Cape  provincial
       chairperson;


  (3) strongly believes that the DA leader has no credible defence  against
       the charges of corruption levelled against his party;


  (4) further believes that the accusations levelled against the  President
       are merely an attempt to  deflect  public  attention  from  the  deep
       crisis in which the DA finds itself; and


  (5) calls upon Mr Leon to stop deflecting attention from the real problem
       of corruption within his party.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the report ``Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act
       2000, trafficking  in  persons  report  of  June  2002''  of  the  US
       Department of State, in which it is stated that -


       (a)  in the past year at least 700 000, and possibly as many as  four
           million, men, women and children worldwide  were  bought,  sold,
           transported or held against their will in slave-like conditions;


       (b)  this modern  form  of  slavery  is  known  as  ``trafficking  in
           persons'';


       (c)  traffickers use threats,  intimidation  and  violence  to  force
           victims to engage in sex acts  or  to  labour  under  conditions
           comparable to  slavery  for  the  trafficker's  financial  gain,
           including forced labour  in  sweatshops,  prostitution  and  sex
           tourism; and


       (d)  the practice also takes other forms, namely abduction into rebel
           armies, the sale of women and children into domestic  servitude,
           and the use  of  children  as  street  beggars  or  agricultural
           workers;


  (2) also notes that the  report  rates  South  Africa  as  a  destination
       country for women, mainly between 18 and 25  years  old,  from  other
       parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia and the  former  Soviet  Union,
       mostly for the sex industry;


  (3) further notes that the report says that -


       (a)  South Africa has had few trafficking investigations;


       (b)  South Africa has no programmes in place to help such women;


       (c)  witness protection only applies to South African citizens;


       (d)  most foreign victims are immediately deported  and  thus  cannot
           assist with prosecutions; and


       (e)   the  Government  has  not  conducted   any   public   awareness
           programmes; and
  (4) calls upon the Government to take note and to remedy the situation in
       South Africa, and to consider action against countries like the Sudan
       and countries in West Africa where slavery still exists.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I give notice that  I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


     supports Bafana Bafana in spirit, whilst we  cannot  be  with  them  in
     person, as we have to engage with the health of the nation.

                    CHILDREN'S RIGHT TO QUALITY EDUCATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern that nearly five million children  throughout  the
       country have no access to good education because their parents cannot
       afford to pay for it;


  (2) further notes  the  statement  by  the  Minister  of  Education  that
       children can no longer be expelled from or  harassed  in  schools  on
       financial grounds;


  (3) believes that it is a disgrace that so many South African children do
       not have access to quality education even in public  schools  because
       their parents cannot afford to pay for it; and


  (4) therefore calls on the Minister  of  Education  to  ensure  that  all
       possible steps are taken to protect the children's right  to  quality
       education.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     REQUEST FOR SUSPENSION OF BUSINESS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that our team, Bafana Bafana, has made us proud so far;


  (2) requests that we adjourn for an hour in a patriotic ...

[Laughter.] [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP(Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Because you  did
not finish your motion, you may not proceed with that motion.

                        GOOD WISHES TO BAFANA BAFANA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that South Africa stands at the threshold of a historic  victory
           by entering the next round of the World Cup finals;


       (b)  the dedication and the commitment of the players in  the  Bafana
           Bafana team; and


       (c)  that Bafana Bafana has just managed to level the  score,  having
           trailed 1-0 in the first seven minutes of the game; and


  (2) wishes Bafana Bafana  well,  and  expresses  the  hope  that  in  the
       remaining 45 minutes of the game they will perform  to  the  best  of
       their ability and do South Africa proud.

Mr A E VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  I  would  recommend  that  we  move  the
following amendment:


  That the following paragraph be added after paragraph (2):


  (3) acknowledges  the  dedication  of  Bafana  Bafana,  as  well  as  the
       dedication of the members of this  Council  for  sitting  here  while
       Bafana Bafana is doing its best.
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP(Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Hon  member,  I
gave an indication when we started. It was an  honest  explanation  of  what
happened between the Chief Whips and me. They were  told  that  they  should
either cut their time, or we would have to sit here until past ten  tonight,
which I think none of you would have  wanted.  When  nobody  wanted  to  cut
time, we could not but proceed. We are therefore proceeding.

Is there any objection to the motion of the Chief Whip?
Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, I want to introduce another  amendment  to  the
Chief Whip's motion, namely that the House further agrees that we should  be
informed of and updated on the score every 30 minutes.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): There is no  substance
in the motion now. [Laughter.] It is losing any substance  it  has.  Can  we
move on to other notices of motion which have substance?

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       PREMATURE CROSSING OF THE FLOOR

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek stel hiermee sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) saamstem met  die  opmerkings  van  die  Speaker  van  die  Nasionale
       Vergadering gister met die strekking dat lede wat van politieke party
       wil verander, versigtig moet wees om nie voortydig vorms te teken  om
       dié voorneme aan te dui nie, aangesien die lid die gevaar loop om  sy
       of haar setel daardeur te verbeur, en


  (2) voorstel dat lede van  provinsiale  wetgewers,  sowel  as  raadslede,
       deeglik daarvan kennis neem, veral in die lig daarvan dat daar  reeds
       verskeie dissiplinêre stappe deur die DA ingestel is  teen  raadslede
       wie se lidmaatskap die DA wil beëindig voordat die oorloopklousule in
       werking tree.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr P A Matthee: Chairman, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) concurs with the remarks yesterday of the  Speaker  of  the  National
       Assembly to the effect  that  members  who  wanted  to  change  their
       political party membership  should  be  careful  not  to  sign  forms
       prematurely to indicate this intention, as the  member  would  be  in
       danger of forfeiting his or her seat as a result; and


  (2) proposes that members of provincial legislatures as well  as  Council
       members seriously take note of this, especially in view of  the  fact
       that the DA  has  already  instituted  various  disciplinary  actions
       against Council members whose membership the DA  wants  to  terminate
       before the floor-crossing clause comes into effect.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     HIV/AIDS INFECTION RATE STABILISING

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) welcomes the announcement made by the Minister of Health that the HIV
       infection rate in the Republic is stabilising;


  (2) notes that this serves as recognition of  the  Government's  HIV/Aids
       policies which encourage safe sex and the use of condoms;


  (3) further  notes  that  communities  need  to  co-operate  with  health
       officials and HIV/Aids activists in fighting this  dreadful  disease;
       and


  (4) commends the Minister of Health for this breakthrough.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              ASSOCIATION OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALS FOR AFRIKAANS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel hiermee sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat Afrikaanssprekende regslui oor die naweek  'n
       Vereniging vir Regslui vir Afrikaans gestig het en dat die vereniging
       bereid is om mense in taalgedinge by te staan;


  (2) 'n beroep doen op regslui van die ander inheemse taalgemeenskappe  om
       dieselfde vir hulle tale te doen; en


  (3)  saam  met  talle  welwillende  Afrikaanssprekendes   en   Afrikaanse
       organisasies alles in sy vermoë sal doen om hulle hierin by te staan.

(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E van Niekerk: Chairman, I hereby move without notice:

That the Council -


  (1)  notes  that  this  weekend  Afrikaans-speaking  legal  professionals
       established an association of legal professionals for  Afrikaans  and
       that the association is prepared to assist people in language-related
       cases;


  (2) appeals to legal professionals from the other  indigenous  linguistic
       communities to do the same for their languages; and


  (3) together with numerous benevolent Afrikaans  speakers  and  Afrikaans
       organisations, will do everything in its power to assist them in this
       regard.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

          RATIFICATION OF DECISION OF JOINT PROGRAMME SUBCOMMITTEE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the motion printed in  my
name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That  the  Council  ratifies  the  decision  that  the  Joint   Programme
  Subcommittee on 11 June 2002 took in accordance with Joint  Rule  216(2),

  Assembly - sec 75) and Loss or Retention of Membership  of  National  and
  Provincial Legislatures Bill [B 25 - 2002] (National Assembly -  sec  76)
  be fast-tracked by, where necessary, shortening any period  within  which
  any step in the  legislative  process  relating  to  the  Bills  must  be
  completed, in order to make it possible for the Bills  to  be  passed  by
  Tuesday, 18 June 2002 (see Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports,
  11 June 2002, p 652).

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 16 - Health:

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson and hon members, the act  of  presenting
the national Health  budget  to  this  Chamber  of  Parliament  focuses  our
attention on the challenges of co-operative  governance.  We  have  come  to
appreciate that co-operative governance demands a high  level  of  alignment
in the planning of programmes  and  budgets  among  provinces,  and  between
provinces and the  national  department.  Without  such  an  alignment,  the
achievement of national health goals will remain a distant dream.

The challenge of aligning our efforts becomes particularly critical  as  the
health  sector  consolidates  its  involvement  in  the  third   sphere   of
government with the building  of  the  district  health  system.  This  will
significantly increase the number of points of influence  over  the  outcome
of  our  interventions.  Clearly  there   are   many   strengths   to   this
decentralised  approach.  The   point   being   made,   however,   is   that
collaboration and commitment to common goals are  absolutely  necessary  for
the system to work, and we cannot assume  that  this  kind  of  co-operation
will occur spontaneously.

Perhaps a starting point is for all of us to have a common understanding  of
what we hope to achieve through the many strategies aimed at  reforming  our
health system. Briefly, we wish to provide a solid  platform  that  delivers
decent quality health  care  services,  in  a  caring  manner,  to  all  our
citizens on the basis of need - services that are equitable  and  reach  the
rich and the poor, the urban and the rural areas.

We see the universal provision of a basic package of care  as  an  important
contribution by the health system to the national effort to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty. This basic package represents a health safety net  for
the poorest and most disadvantaged sections of our society.

We are striving for a health care system that is  efficient  and  affordable
and that  impacts  on  our  population  in  a  way  that  promotes  economic
development and raises the standard of living, for  instance  by  prolonging
life, reducing disability and lowering dependency ratios.

We view our health system as an  instrument  well  suited  to  forging  good
relations with our neighbours and supporting the broad  development  of  our
region and continent,  and,  hopefully,  as  a  contribution  to  humanity's
common struggle against disease and suffering.

More particularly, our health  system  must  support  intersectoral  efforts
aimed at keeping South Africans  healthy,  particularly  promoting  equality
and developing our human resources, including gender equality.

I highlight these points to indicate that there  are  competing  demands  on
our system and that the relationship between  different  components  of  the
system will not always be harmonious. Pain may have to  be  endured  in  one
area in order to achieve substantial benefits in another. This,  I  believe,
is the perspective that needs to inform  our  analysis  as  we  examine  the
budget before us.

At the outset, let me state that, although we continue to make progress,  we
can do even better. Above all,  we  need  to  take  responsibility  for  our
actions. We cannot be indecisive and sloppy, yet  expect  good  results.  We
cannot lead without good leaders. Wherever there is  strong  leadership,  we
see the reward of good results. At the same time, indecision can  only  lead
to the disappointing results we see, for example, in some of  our  provinces
and, to some extent, in other provinces as well.

It is fitting, therefore, as we consider the  policy  objectives  that  this
budget of R7,18 billion supports, that  we  survey  the  resources  and  the
capacity available across the country, to implement the approaches  we  have
adopted. We cannot ignore the fact  that  our  public  health  system  still
features grave inequities among  provinces.  Many  of  our  national  budget
goals, and many of the  millennium  development  goals,  relate  to  dealing
effectively with the risks to good  health.  Programmes  of  prevention  and
health promotion, plus early intervention, make  the  most  impact  when  it
comes to improving health indicators.

I spoke extensively about these in my address to the National  Assembly  and
looked particularly at factors like tobacco use, alcohol abuse,  drug  abuse
and environmental hazards. Risk management in  relation  to  the  health  of
mothers and children is also critical to the achievement of our core  health
goals. The reduction of infant and under-five mortality rates is a  critical
objective in our national health strategy and international programmes  that
we have endorsed.

Improved immunisation is a key success factor in reducing  child  mortality.
As a country we have succeeded in  expanding  the  number  of  illnesses  we
immunise against, in running mass immunisation campaigns  and  in  improving
the proportion of fully immunised children. The last  aspect  has  been  won
slowly and it has come about largely as a result of integrating our  primary
health care services and running clinics as one-stop shops.  Clinic  workers
are encouraged to use every contact with the child to  catch  up  on  missed
opportunities.

However, there are one or two provinces that lag  behind.  The  gap  between
our worst and best provinces, in terms of the proportion of fully  immunised
children, is as much as 25%. International experience is quite  clear:  Once
immunisation levels drop  below  a  critical  point,  diseases  aggressively
reclaim their ground. We truly need the co-operation  of  all  provinces  to
ensure that this does not happen here. Another intervention  that  has  been
shown internationally to improve the survival chances  of  children  is  the
integrated  management  of  childhood  illnesses.  I  am  happy  to   report
continued progress in expanding this approach across the country.

Last year we reflected on the challenges we face in  improving  the  Primary
School Nutrition Programme, which continues to benefit more than  4  million
children. A review of the PSNP produced a  series  of  recommendations,  and
Cabinet has given us the green light to act on these. At the  heart  of  the
changes is improved co-operation  between  the  Departments  of  Health  and
Education,  increased  community  involvement  and  the   incorporation   of
national standards.

We will need support from all provinces later this year  when  we  introduce
regulations that will require manufacturers of mealie meal  and  wheat  meal
flour to add a range of micronutrients to their products. Although  we  have
taken care to work with the major interest groups and taken  precautions  to
ensure that small milling companies will be able to meet  the  requirements,
some opposition to this change is inevitable.

It is important, therefore, that we  are  clear  about  the  need  for  this
intervention. The primary evidence comes from the  food  consumption  survey
that showed high levels  of  micronutrient  deficiency  and  a  low  calorie
intake in children under nine years old. It also revealed  stunting  in  22%
of children in this age group.

Turning to our goals in relation to women's health, the  risks  that  relate
to pregnancy and childbirth remain a central concern. I  feel  compelled  to
refer  to  the  issues  that  have  come  to  the  fore   in   relation   to
implementation of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy  Act.  The  message
that filtered clearly through last month's parliamentary  hearings  is  that
women seeking terminations are being denied this  choice,  because  too  few
health workers are prepared to perform the procedure. We know,  through  our
systematic monitoring of maternal deaths, that loss of life  due  to  septic
abortions has dropped during the past three years. we believe that  this  is
due to the availability of free, safe and legal terminations.  However,  the
decrease in deaths due to abortion is still not what we would like to see.

The public health system must take more  seriously  its  responsibility  for
eliminating abortion-linked deaths, through  more  accessible  contraceptive
programmes, in the first instance, and through a  termination  service  that
is able to respect and act on women's choices.

During the past year we have produced national guidelines  on  contraception
and a policy on youth and adolescent health. We sincerely  hope  that  these
documents will  assist  provinces  to  extend  age-appropriate  reproductive
health services.

We understand  the  causes  of  maternal  deaths  only  because  we  have  a
dedicated, anonymous monitoring system. It has been  operational  for  about
four years, and now I wish to acknowledge  the  effort  that  our  committed
health workers make to ensure its maintenance. In some  provinces  there  is
such a shortage of gynaecologists and obstetricians that monitoring  depends
on better-resourced  provinces  sharing  monitoring  committees  with  their
neighbours, as in the case of the Free State, which has been supporting  the
Northern Cape.

When it comes to the programme goals for HIV  and  Aids,  we  have  come  to
appreciate that a strong voluntary counselling and testing  service  is  the
foundation for success in many more specific interventions. This was one  of
the first lessons  from  the  research  sites  on  reducing  mother-to-child
transmission of HIV. The quality of the counselling and the  convenience  of
the testing facility actually determined the uptake on the services.

For the last two years, since the introduction of the rapid  HIV  test,  the
expansion of testing sites has been a priority for  which  special  national
funding has been made available. In practice, the expansion has  been  quite
variable from province to  province.  Some  provinces  have  more  that  100
testing facilities, others only a handful. Undoubtedly this is  an  area  in
which we must jointly reassess our targets and  tackle  some  of  the  human
resource constraints that affect the creation of  accessible,  user-friendly
testing facilities.

On the HIV prevention front, there is  evidence  of  involvement  in  public
events  and  campaigns  across  the  country.  Surveys  indicate  close   to
universal availability of condoms at clinics,  and  this  year  we  will  be
supplying 350 million condoms free of charge. Members  of  the  public  cite
health facilities as an important source of information  on  HIV  and  Aids.
School-based  life  skills  programmes  are  gaining  ground,  although   at
different rates in different provinces.

The major boost that we have received from the Global Fund will benefit  all
provinces through stronger prevention campaigns, the improvement  of  youth-
oriented services and better TB control. I would  like  to  recognise  those
provinces that are moving ahead rapidly to  utilise  the  conditional  grant
for step-down care. For instance, during the April Health  Month,  the  Free
State  launched  step-down  facilities  in  a  number  of  districts  almost
simultaneously. Gauteng and the Western Cape have also  done  well  in  this
area.

Another area in which substantial progress has been  recorded  in  the  last
year is the training of health workers in various aspects of  the  treatment
of people with HIV and Aids. Some of this training has taken  place  through
Health department training structures and some has been  a  product  of  the
Diflucan Partnership with Pfizer. KwaZulu-Natal built  a  particularly  good
training programme around this. The provision of  Diflucan  is  going  well,
but we suspect there are pockets of unmet need. We  would  welcome  feedback
from the public and public representatives about the gaps in this service.

We  have  also  seen  a  strengthening  of  the  intersectoral  approach  at
provincial and district level, with the  consolidation  of  provincial  Aids
councils and the expansion of Aids councils in municipal areas. We now  have
Aids councils in at least 55% of local government jurisdictions.

The  North  West  province  has  taken  the  process  through  to   all   18
subdistricts. The importance of  local-level  co-ordination  and  networking
cannot be overestimated. It  lays  the  basis  for  integrating  prevention,
treatment and care, and it is  our  only  hope  of  ensuring  that  positive
individuals get appropriate support and treatment at every stage.

In recognition of the need to increase resources for the treatment and  care
of people living with HIV and Aids,  Cabinet  factored  an  additional  R400
million into the equitable share allocated to the provinces.  All  provinces
except the Eastern Cape have recovered growth in  their  health  allocations
for the current year, and it appears that this  allocation  to  improve  our
collective response to HIV, Aids and TB has  largely  reached  its  intended
target.

However, it remains a concern that even as the  national  department  is  in
talks with the Treasury for additional funding to improve  our  response  to
HIV, Aids, STIs and TB, there are a few pockets of money allocated for  Aids
programmes that go unspent.

Improving mental health care is  certainly  an  item  on  our  checklist  of
national priorities. Just a few weeks  ago  this  House  set  its  stamp  of
approval on the Mental Health Care Bill and we now must ready  ourselves  to
implement it. At the national level this  has  meant  finalising  the  draft
regulations that will deal,  among  other  things,  with  the  licensing  of
establishments for the treatment of mental  health  problems  and  will  set
quality standards for some of the more  controversial  forms  of  treatment,
such as electrotherapy and sleep therapy.

However, the weight of preparation for implementing this legislation  really
rests with the provinces. The law seeks to place a much greater emphasis  on
treating mental health conditions within the  community  or  within  general
health facilities.

This requires that a large number of health workers in primary  health  care
settings and general hospitals must  be  trained  to  manage  mental  health
problems. I believe  that  the  essentials  are  in  place  -  the  training
materials and the trainers - and I trust that  the  President's  signing  of
the law will be the catalyst that is evidently required to get this  process
moving.

The new law also states very  plainly  the  obligations  of  health  service
providers in terms of upholding and promoting the human rights of  patients.
A particular challenge  is  the  assertion  that  the  patients'  rights  to
dignity must be upheld at all times. The  physical  state  of  some  of  our
psychiatric hospitals, fortunately not all of them, is truly an  affront  to
human dignity and this must receive  urgent  attention.  The  rehabilitative
element of patient care also demands greater investment.

The issue of quality of care and patients' rights is, of course, a  critical
issue at all our health institutions. The hospital rehabilitation  programme
and hospital management deal with some substantial elements  of  quality  of
care. They focus, on the one hand, on  the  physical  necessity  for  decent
care - the buildings and the technology - and  they  target  the  management
systems and the skills needed by managers in order to  drive  a  process  of
quality improvement.

This comprehensive  approach  has  kicked  off  at  one  hospital  in  every
province this year. Planning is already under way to include  another  three
hospitals per province from next year. Eventually the bulk of  the  hospital
rehabilitation grant will be channelled into carefully  planned  initiatives
to boost patient care from various angles, instead of  being  used  only  to
replace or patch up buildings.

Encouraging though these developments are, a word of caution  is  in  order.
Hospital rehabilitation is a  slow  process  and  we  are  tackling  a  huge
backlog. To appreciate progress, we need  therefore  to  take  a  long-range
view. We certainly will  need  increased  resources  to  make  a  meaningful
impact, and provinces too will have to improve their financial  contribution
to maintenance and capital works.

This year, in a principled move towards equity, the  conditional  grant  for
tertiary care will be shared more equally among provinces instead  of  being
focused purely on the four provinces  with  the  major  academic  hospitals.
Most provinces will gain from this allocation of resources,  and  we  firmly
expect a  visible  improvement  in  patient  care.  The  Eastern  Cape,  for
instance, in terms of the new like-for-like funding  of  tertiary  services,
gets R124 million this year. KwaZulu-Natal gets R50  million  more  and  the
Northern Cape's allocation increases by 44%.

A key innovation in the national tertiary services grant  is  the  inclusion
of a development component aimed at assisting poorer  provinces  to  recruit
specialists without dipping into their equitable share.

It is almost  self-evident  that  the  availability  of  appropriate  health
technology is critical to the quality of care. Until recently there  was  no
systematic data on problems relating to technology.

In the last year, however, we  have  received  the  results  of  a  detailed
health technology audit, done  on  a  pilot  basis  in  two  provinces,  the
Eastern Cape and Limpopo.  These  are  both  rural  provinces  with  similar
socioeconomic profiles, and this might lead one to expect similar levels  of
service infrastructure. But the audit showed this was not the case  when  it
came to health technology.

Despite its modest resources, Limpopo managed to come  acceptably  close  to
several international norms in terms  of  the  age,  the  turnover  and  the
maintenance of equipment. As a province, the Eastern Cape fell short on  all
counts, although there were individual hospitals within  the  province  that
fared better. Overall the message was clear. Money alone will not  have  the
desired impact on  improving  health  technology.  Good  management  is  the
critical ingredient. Without skilled technology  management,  we  will  have
expenses without good care.

This audit has been so useful that it  will  be  extended  to  the  renaming
seven provinces. Quality of care at  the  district  level  may  be  measured
objectively against the standard package of  care  that  has  been  formally
adopted for national implementation. During the course of this year  we  got
the  results  of  an  audit  that  measured  current  services  against  the
standards set in the package. We were encouraged  to  find  that  there  are
clinics that are already doing more than 95% of what is expected. But  there
were also a substantial number trailing around the  50%  mark  and  we  have
until 2007 to get these up to standard.

The package of primary care services is  also  our  yardstick  for  improved
health care in the nodes of the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development
Programme. In every node, a specialised worker has been appointed  to  guide
the process of closing the gap between the present  levels  of  service  and
the levels set out in the package of  care.  We  are  also  emphasising  the
generation of good health information in the  nodes  and,  more  than  that,
ensuring that this information is used by local communities and planners  to
address local needs.

The structural interventions and the systems that create the possibility  of
better care are extremely important, but equally, if not more, important  is
the creativeness and dedication of hospital and  clinic  managers,  of  ward
sisters and ordinary health workers who have the power to turn  an  ordinary
or poor service into something special. There are many examples of this  and
I would like to share a few.

A quality assurance has been in place at Piet Retief Hospital in  Mpumalanga
and has reduced mortality among newborn babies  simply  by  making  relevant
protocols available  to  its  nurses,  training  them  in  the  use  of  the
protocols and teaching nurses how to monitor mortality rates.  It  has  also
focused on improving the detection and treatment of  tuberculosis  and  has,
within a year, increased the TB cure rate from 40% of cases to 80%.

In Gauteng, some of the shortlisted services in the annual  Khanyisa  awards
for service excellence have  focused  on  reducing  the  waiting  times  for
patients by using various systems of booking and categorising  patients.  At
Kagiso Clinic the waiting time for  acute  cases  has  been  reduced  to  20
minutes in a facility where about 120 patients are seen daily by just  three
professional nurses, a nursing assistant, a health promoter and a clerk.

In the nation's response to HIV and Aids there are countless  projects  that
are born out of compassion and respect for the  community.  Fifty  inspiring
case studies are presented in a booklet called Our young people take it  on,
which is a joint publication of the Departments of Education and Health.

At the district level, the incomplete merging of  provincial  and  municipal
health services continues to present problems  in  terms  of  the  effective
management of facilities. We view the  incorporation  of  municipal  workers
into the Public Service, effectively creating a single  Public  Service,  as
the most significant contribution that could be made at this  stage  to  the
building of our district health system.

Health  workers  have  dealt  with  considerable  uncertainty  during   this
protracted restructuring  and  have  gone  to  great  lengths  to  make  the
informal or functional integration  of  provincial  and  municipal  services
work. But it  simply  is  not  sustainable  to  have  professionals  who  do
comparable jobs in the  same  clinic  earning  different  salaries,  working
different hours and receiving different benefits.

For some sectors, the creation of a  single  Public  Service  is  merely  an
option. For the health sector it is a  necessity  without  which  we  cannot
consolidate the primary level  of  service.  The  relationship  between  the
private and public health sectors remains a challenging area of  work  where
we have only begun to exploit the possibilities. Of course, the  interaction
takes many forms, from regulation to co-operation,  and  it  occurs  at  all
levels right down to individual health facilities.

The interaction that  claimed  the  headlines  this  year  was  the  dispute
between Discovery Health and the Council for Medical Schemes. No  doubt  hon
members are aware that the parties settled their  differences  a  few  weeks
ago and I must say I am pleased that they have avoided  a  protracted  court
battle. I am even more pleased to note that the settlement is firmly  within
the boundaries of the Medical Schemes Act and it affirms to  council's  role
in protecting the consumer. If we want to  encourage  more  people  to  join
medical schemes and assume responsibility for the cost of their  own  health
care, we must offer potential members security  and  cost  containment.  The
Act seeks to do this by ensuring that  schemes  meet  prescribed  levels  of
financial  reserves  and  by  limiting  the  exposure  of  schemes  to   the
commercial environment of the insurance industry. In  his  handling  of  the
Discovery matter, the Registrar of Medical Schemes has shown that we have  a
robust law that can be used quite effectively to protect  the  interests  of
the public.

In the year ahead, we expect to see some movement on  the  restructuring  of
medical schemes cover  for  public  servants.  Government,  as  the  biggest
single employer in the country, is responsible for no less than 12%  of  the
total  amount  paid  into  medical  schemes,  but  there  are  some  obvious
shortcomings about  the  way  this  cover  is  structured.  Firstly,  public
servants  can  belong  to  any  scheme  of  their  choice,   so   Government
contributions are fragmented. Secondly, only  40%  of  public  servants  are
covered because most cannot afford existing medical aid tariffs.

The Ministers of Health and Finance have also resolved the question  of  how
medical scheme brokers will be regulated.  They  will  remain  part  of  the
medical schemes environment and a major amendment  to  the  Medical  Schemes
Act will clarify their position further.

Because of the grave inequities in this country between public  and  private
health care, we are concerned about avoiding  irrational  expansion  in  the
private sector. We believe that expansion must be strictly  needs-based  and
result in greater access for our people. We are therefore not in  favour  of
the mass expansion of health tourism, which has  the  potential  to  further
drain personnel from the public health  sector  to  serve  foreign  patients
while our own people lack care in many areas.

In the arena of service delivery, public-private partnerships are  beginning
to register their presence. At the new  Nkosi  Albert  Luthuli  Hospital  in
Durban,  the  maintenance  of  the  facility  and  all  equipment  has  been
contracted to the private sector in  a  bid  to  ensure  that  the  hospital
always has cutting-edge technology available for tertiary-level services.

In the Free State and Eastern Cape excess  bed  capacity  in  hospitals  has
been leased to the private sector. In addition to  the  lease  payment,  the
private sector puts up  capital  for  the  refurbishment  of  the  hospitals
involved.

At  Johannesburg  Hospital,  a  pilot   project   involving   differentiated
amenities  for  private,  paying  patients  was  launched  quite   recently.
Differentiation only extends to the hotel services  while  the  standard  of
clinical care  is  uniform  across  the  hospital.  Kimberley  Hospital  has
successfully implemented a similar model.

All of these initiatives aim  to  pump  additional  funds  into  the  public
sector and bring us a bit closer to our central objective of quality  health
care for all our citizens.

In closing, I would like to extend ny sincere thanks to  a  whole  range  of
individuals and structures that have assisted me in fulfilling  my  role  as
the national Minister of Health during the past year.  The  provincial  MECs
for  health,  the  heads  of  the  provincial  health  departments  and  the
representatives of the SA Local Government Association and the  SA  Military
Health Service make a crucial contribution and really give  meaning  to  the
notion of co-operative governance.

Of course,  this  top  layer  of  management  depends  on  the  support  and
expertise of a wide range of managers, including managers on the front  line
in our hospitals and district services. I would like  to  say  very  clearly
that we know just how valuable they are to the public health system.

I wish to thank the members of the select committee  in  this  Council,  and
especially the chairperson, the  hon  Jacobus,  for  their  interest,  their
constructive  criticism  and  the  perspectives  they   bring   from   their
respective provinces.

My thanks also go to the portfolio committee in the  National  Assembly  and
to chairperson Ngculu in particular. I am indebted to my Cabinet  colleagues
for their interest in matters pertaining to this  portfolio  and  to  social
cluster Ministers for their supportive work. I would like to  recognise  the
Director-General of Health, Dr Ayanda Ntsaluba, for his  leadership  and  to
thank the team in the department.

Finally I would like to express my appreciation  to  those  who  support  me
most directly, my advisers and all personnel in the Ministry, my family,  in
particular my  husband  Comrade  Msimang,  and  my  two  daughters,  and  my
household support staff, the  lady  who  helps  me  in  the  house  and  the
gardener. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, it is unfortunate that we have  to  compete  with
the excitement that is taking place outside.

Hon Minister, MECs, special delegates and members, it is again the  time  of
the year when we review our progress  made  over  the  past  year  and  also
highlight the areas where attention is needed.

Whilst we will pat ourselves on the back where we have done  well,  we  must
also critically look at areas where we need to improve. We  are  all  agreed
that the Budget is the one instrument  that  we  have  at  our  disposal  to
realise service delivery  to  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  It  is  the  one
instrument that we have at our disposal with which  we  can  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty. In the words of our Minister of Finance in his  Budget
Speech to the nation in February 2002:


  We must be clear about the fact that the reason we need to combat poverty
  is that it deprives individuals and, by  extension,  societies  of  their
  full potential. It robs children of their childhood. It  condemns  adults
  to illiteracy. It deprives people of access to simple necessities such as
  safe drinking water. It condemns many millions to disease. It wears  down
  the human spirit and robs people of their dignity. We must fight poverty,
  because until it has been  overcome  we  cannot  lay  claim  to  being  a
  compassionate society.

It is against this quote as a backdrop  that  I  want  to  submit  my  input
today. Areas I will highlight are the following:  per  capita  spending  and
interprovincial equity, the Primary School  Nutrition  Programme  and,  last
but not least, HIV and Aids.

Firstly, let me pledge the support of the committee  to  the  health  budget
for 2002-03. It reports an overall increase of 4,4%,  which,  in  rands  and
cents, translate into R538 million. A percentage breakdown  of  this  amount
per province comes  to  0,9%  for  the  Eastern  Cape  and  the  Free  State
provinces, 6% for Gauteng, -0,5% for KwaZulu-Natal,  13,6%  for  Mpumalanga,
8,7% for the Northern Cape, 8,9% for Limpopo, 13% for the  North  West,  and
5,1% for the Western Cape.

The details for these  increases  will  be  deliberated  upon  by  the  MECs
present here and special delegates from various provinces. It  is,  however,
heartening to note that the bulk of these increases go  to  Mpumalanga,  the
North West and Limpopo. It shows a commitment from the Department of  Health
to accelerate health service delivery in these provinces, commonly  referred
to as the poorer provinces.

Getting to per  capita  spending  and  interprovincial  equity,  at  present
Gauteng spends R1 506 per person, the Western Cape R1  218  per  person  and
KwaZulu-Natal R886 per person. These still  remain  the  top  three  in  per
capita spending. This pattern seems  to  be  continuing  for  the  next  two
years. Although a steady increase is recorded in  the  per  capita  spending
per province over the past three years, Limpopo spends R513 per person,  the
North West R548 and Mpumalanga R554. These three remain at  the  bottom  end
of the scale.

The latter three provinces have also been identified as falling  within  the
category of poorer provinces. It is therefore also assumed  that  people  in
these provinces, especially in the remote rural areas, would also have  less
or no access to clean drinking water and  balanced  nutrition.  Diseases  of
poverty would therefore also be much more prevalent in these areas,  and  it
would therefore be logical to distribute resources in way that  favours  our
poorer provinces. We might have to consider turning the budget on  its  head
if we want push back the frontiers of poverty, as per the directive  of  our
hon President and the Minister of Finance.

The budget  hearings  which  I  attended  also  revealed  that  we  are  not
significantly narrowing  the  gap  between  the  historically  disadvantaged
provinces  and  the  better-resourced  ones.  This  is  of  great   concern,
especially in the Northern  Province,  or  Limpopo,  where  the  health  and
social sector only received 16% of the global budget.

If we look at the Eastern Cape  we  come  across  the  same  dilemma,  where
conditional grants constitute the bulk of the equitable share and  very  few
resources are thus available to deal with service and  service  delivery.  A
question that arises then is  the  following:  Do  the  provinces  have  the
ability to negotiate bigger budgets? Do they  have  the  capacity  to  spend
these budgets?

In my own understanding, to both these questions, the answer is no. We  must
therefore look at ways of assisting these provinces to build and  strengthen
capacity in terms of political and technical  assistance.  We,  as  MPs  and
public representatives from our various provinces, have a critical  role  to
play in terms of advocacy to ensure that we  move  closer  to  our  goal  of
achieving equity amongst our provinces.

On the Primary School Nutrition Programme, the main aim of the  introduction
of  the  Integrated  Nutrition  Programme,  or  INP,  is  to   improve   the
nutritional status of children, to enhance their learning  capacity  and  to
improve  the  school  attendance  of  primary  school  learners  from   poor
households.

The Department of Health must also be congratulated on the increase  in  the
coverage of primary schools that qualify for the feeding scheme. To  date  a
total of 4,8 million children are fed, covering a total of  14  500  schools
throughout the country. A  marked  reduction  in  underweight  children  and
stunted  growth  has  been  recorded  in  schools  where  the  programme  is
operative.

I was, however, saddened and disappointed when I attended one of the  public
hearing sessions organised by the portfolio committee chairperson about  the
budget. The North West in particular - and it is unfortunate that  there  is
no MEC or special delegate from that province -  reported  underspending  in
two very critical areas, the HIV/Aids programme and the INP,  which  is  the
nutritional programme. I want to propose that MECs  and  Ministers  look  at
disciplinary  measures  against  officials  who  do  not  account  for   the
spending, or rather underspending, of allocated funds.

The Eastern Cape and North West had underspent on their nutrition  programme
conditional grants, with the Eastern Cape spending 44% and  the  North  West
spending 58%. Overall the provinces only managed to spend 78% of  the  total
budget of the INP, and this is a drop from the previous year, when  87%  was
spent.  It  seems  that  provincial  treasuries   in   the   provinces   are
transferring payments too late,  reportedly  around  November,  subsequently
affecting service delivery. Also with regard to the INP conditional  grants,
the long chain of command causes further bottlenecks, and we recommend  that
simpler methods and structures of accountability be explored.

With HIV and Aids being one of the priority focus areas of  our  Government,
it is indeed good news to  note  that  the  budget  for  HIV/Aids  has  been
increased.  This  increase  has  also  been  reflected  in  the   respective
provincial allocations. It reflects Government's commitment to fighting  the
scourge of HIV/Aids, which threatens to wipe  out  mainly  our  economically
active youth and plunge families further into the dark pit of poverty.

The Minister of Health, in  her  statement  on  10  June  2002,  highlighted
survey findings that HIV prevalence was 24,8% nationally.  Unfortunately  we
do not have a full provincial breakdown of this figure, but I hope that  the
provincial allocations are  proportional  to  the  prevalence  rate,  which,
according to a 1998  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  survey,  reflects
Mpumalanga,  KwaZulu-Natal  and  Gauteng  to  be  amongst  the  highest   in
prevalence.

Although the provinces have improved their spending on HIV and  Aids,  there
have been differences in performance according  to  province.  For  example,
Mpumalanga did not spend its allocation  at  all  for  community  home-based
care. A 0% spending was recorded. The Eastern Cape only spent 67%  of  their
allocation. At least is it the bulk of their allocation.  If  provinces  are
to expand their PMTCT programme, then support must  be  given  to  provinces
that have capacity problems, such as the Eastern Cape,  Limpopo,  Mpumalanga
and the North West.

The issue that directly impacts on service delivery must be addressed  at  a
technical and political level, for example  the  chronic  late  transfer  of
funds, which I referred  to  earlier.  If  we  are  to  successfully  expand
community and home-based care programmes, much more community  participation
and mobilisation is an absolute prerequisite.

Successful expansion of our HIV and  Aids  programmes  is  also  reliant  on
intersectoral participation in matters such  as  water  and  social  service
delivery. We cannot rely  on  the  health  sector  exclusively.  The  social
development sector has to be recognised as another entry point for  services
to those affected and infected.

In closing, we were also informed by the Department of Health  when  we  got
our briefing that provincial heads of health are expected to submit  monthly
and quarterly financial reports. These  reports  could  serve  as  an  early
warning sign, and where expenditure  problems  could  be  detected.  Timeous
interventions could then  be  made  to  avoid  crisis  situations  involving
either underspending or  overspending.  We  were  also  told  that  in  most
instances it is easier to  get  blood  out  of  a  stone  than  to  get  the
provinces to submit these reports.

I see no reason why the MECs, some of whom are here today, and the  Minister
cannot deal with officials who execute their job  descriptions  selectively.
The common task we as public representatives and civil servants have  is  to
ensure that services are delivered to our people, especially  the  poor  and
marginalised. As I said at the beginning,  the  one  tool  we  have  at  our
disposal to do this is the budget. If we are serious about pushing back  the
frontiers of poverty in order to create a better life for  all  our  people,
we need to act against anyone who does anything that impacts  negatively  on
quality service delivery to the poor and vulnerable.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister of  Health,
who is always available and whose cellphone  is  always  on.  She  sometimes
phones me at 6 o'clock on a Saturday morning. I would  also  like  to  thank
her department, led by the director-general and his team and very  competent
officials, some of whom are here in  the  gallery  today.  They  are  always
available to respond to the needs of the committee at all times.

Last but not least I thank the members  of  the  committee,  who,  sometimes
under very difficult  circumstances,  are  always  there  to  perform  their
duties as public representatives from the various provinces. [Applause.]

Ms M N S MANANA (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, hon Ministers  and  hon  members,
let  me  begin  by  wishing  all  young  people  throughout  the  country  a
prosperous and a successful Youth Month. As  we  all  know,  June  is  Youth
Month. I would like to say to the youth that  by  their  actions  they  must
demonstrate that they are a youth united in action against  racism,  sexism,
xenophobia and all forms of discrimination.

I feel very grateful to be invited to and afforded an  opportunity  to  take
part in today's debate. Let me indicate  from  the  outset  that  Mpumalanga
still  stands  firmly  for  transformation  to   achieve   social   justice,
particularly through the service we deliver that touches the lives of  those
who are most deprived.

The budget that the department of health in Mpumalanga  has  been  allocated
for this financial year of 2002-03 is R1 656 566 000, of which  R1  449  817
000 is for the equitable share and R206 749 000 is for conditional grants.

Health should be seen as an  investment  rather  than  an  expenditure.  The
health of the  people  will  be  served  and  improved  mainly  through  the
achievement of equitable social and economic development.

If we are to achieve these, we must also turn our focus onto  the  promotion
of healthy lifestyles and the provision of a high quality of care.  A  range
of preventative and promotional programmes have  been  designed  to  promote
healthy lifestyles for the Mpumalanga inhabitants, for gains in  the  health
status of the population are secured mainly by the interventions  that  take
place outside our hospitals and clinics.

We have seen the Ministers and MECs, especially during the health  month  of
April 2002, taking to the fields with hoes to promote food gardens and  good
eating habits throughout the country.

In addition, the department is engaged in the following campaigns: drug  and
substance  abuse  awareness  campaigns  and  teenage  sexuality   programmes
targeting the youth; breast and  cervical  cancer  screening  and  awareness
programmes targeting  women;  and  programmes  promoting  awareness  of  the
hazards of tobacco products and smoking, especially amongst men.

African countries are categorised as developing countries. Most of them  are
poverty-stricken. Therefore an urgent intervention from the world  community
is needed.  People  are  affected  by  diseases,  hunger,  unemployment  and
migration.
The launch of the Health Month in April 2000  was  a  consolidation  of  our
programmes, as the month was focused on nutrition. Through  our  programmes,
the following were addressed: Poverty alleviation, improvement in  household
food security,  community  development  empowerment  and  food  security  in
poverty-stricken areas, targeting primary schools.

These programmes contribute  to  the  alleviation  of  poverty  through  the
implementation of sustainable nutrition projects by  ensuring  self-reliance
in communities involved in these  projects.  The  role-playing  sectors  are
provided with technical support,  nutritional  education  and  promotion  to
ensure  household  food  security  and  adequate  care  for  the  successful
implementation of intrasectoral and  intersectoral  projects.  Currently  37
projects are being implemented. Five new projects  are  in  the  process  of
being implemented.

Approximately 1 322 primary schools, which consist of 450 000 needy  primary
school learners from farms and  rural  areas,  benefited  from  the  primary
health  school   feeding   programmes.   These   programmes   also   benefit
approximately 2 506 unemployed women from the  surrounding  communities  who
help with the preparation of food and  31  SMMEs  that  are  suppliers.  The
department needs to ensure that the SMMEs are  encouraged  to  buy  supplies
from  the  community  members  involved  in  those   community   development
programmes. The integrated nutrition programme has  been  allocated  R39,728
million.

HIV/Aids, TB and STDs remain our biggest  challenge.  Given  this  scenario,
HIV/Aids cannot be addressed as a single issue or by a  vertical  programme.
A multisectoral approach is  a  prerequisite  for  the  containment  of  the
spread of the infection. The department is in partnership with the  National
Youth Commission and various progressive NGOs like Napwa and Phaphamani  and
radio stations like Ligwalagwala and Ikwekwezi.

The department finds it necessary that the youth commission  and  the  young
positive living ambassadors play an important role  in  promoting  awareness
and education amongst the youth of the province. I would like to  thank  the
chairperson  of  the  youth  commission,  Mr  Mxolisi  Dladla,   the   youth
commissioners and the CEO of the youth commission, Mr P Mnisi, for the  good
work that they are doing in the province.

Indeed, it is true that Mpumalanga did  underspend  on  this  programme  the
past financial year,  precisely  because  the  leader  was  engaged  in  the
activities of his NGO, which is called MPSA, and as a  result  the  work  of
the unit suffered. Investigations were conducted and he has since  resigned.
This had the effect of delaying the implementation of the project.  The  new
director of this unit has since been  appointed  with  effect  from  January
2002. Business plans are in place to conduct programmes of  this  unit  such
as  the  awareness  campaign,  voluntary  counselling   and   testing,   the
prevention of mother-to-child transmission, home-based care  and  the  step-
down facilities. The unit will be submitting monthly and quarterly  reports.


As far as home-based care services are concerned, the provincial  integrated
plan on HIV and Aids was  approved  by  the  social  cluster  and  is  being
implemented in six sites, namely Tonga, Eerstehoek,  Mmamethlake,  Matibidi,
Kwamhlanga and Piet Retief, and 45 home-based care co-ordinators  have  been
trained in the national minimum standards of home-based  community  care.  A
population of 132 000 is accessing home-based community  care,  services  as
part of the integrated plan. A plan to  promote  the  supply  of  community-
based care kits is in the process of finalisation. The department's aim  for
the current financial year is  to  expedite  the  funding  of  the  NGOs  to
sustain and expand the provision of home-based care.

With  regard  to  voluntary  counselling  and  testing  services,  200   lay
counsellors have been trained to provide VCT and 48 mentor counsellors  have
been trained to support the counsellors' services. Forty medical  sites  are
providing the VCT services. All the sites are using the rapid testing  kits.
Approximately 20% of the population has access to the VCT  services.  Social
awareness campaigns are being conducted at the sites.

In addition, all health workers need to be trained  in  VCT,  especially  to
administer HIV rapid testing. The department  further  plans  to  lobby  the
NGOs as support structures for marketing VCT  services  in  the  public  and
private sectors.

As far as the PMTCT programme is  concerned,  the  research  sites  for  the
prevention of mother-to-child transmission where established as required  by
the national department. Our sites for nevirapine are continuing to  provide
the  drug  to  pregnant  women  and  newborn  babies.   We   have   invested
considerable time  and  energy  in  preparing  the  research  site  for  the
prevention  of  mother-to-child  transmission.  The  programme  is   closely
integrated with the VCT programme.

During the month of July, the Shongwe site will  be  testing  nine-month-old
babies. The department is expanding the programme to the feeder  clinics  in
both sites. We are also planning the provincial roll-out  of  the  programme
to be in line with the  national  target  date  of  30  December  2002.  The
training of the master trainers is expected to take  place  from  15  to  26
July in all the provincial hospitals.

Despite the challenges that lie ahead of us, we  are  certain  that  we  are
well on the road to building a health service that all  the  inhabitants  of
Mpumalanga can be proud of. To achieve this, we  have  ...  [Time  expired.]

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek het die voorreg gehad om deel  te  neem
aan die gesondheidsdebat in die Vrystaatse wetgewer op 12 Maart  en  ek  het
ook die geleentheid gehad om na die agb  LUR  wat  ook  vandag  hier  is  se
begrotingstoespraak te luister. Daaruit was dit duidelik dat die agb LUR  en
haar span wel deeglik die vingers op die pols van gesondheidsdienste in  die
Vrystaat het en dat hulle baie positief is om die  uitdagings  die  hoof  te
bied. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairman, I had  the  privilege  of  taking  part  in  the
health debate in the Free State legislature on 12 March and I also  had  the
opportunity to listen to the budget speech of the MEC, who is  also  present
today. From that it was clear that the hon MEC and her team thoroughly  have
their fingers on the pulse of health services in the  Free  State  and  that
they are very positive about overcoming the challenges.]

It was therefore was indeed a  great  disappointment  for  me  to  hear  the
following remarks from the hon MEC in her budget speech, and I quote:


  It is clear that there is little new money to introduce  new  programmes.
  An analysis in the department showed that in real terms,  the  department
  is allocated less for its comparable activities in 2002-03  than  it  was
  allocated in the previous financial year.

This is really putting a tremendous burden on health care  delivery  in  the
Free State.  The  ever-escalating  burden  that  the  HIV/Aids  pandemic  is
putting on the health sector as well as salary  increments  and  the  normal
health inflation are making it even more difficult.
The department of health in the Free State is, however, striving to  improve
its efficiency to face the challenges. The hon  MEC  stated  in  her  budget
speech that the total revenue collected at the end of the 2002-03  financial
year will be about R56 million. This is 10% more than the  revenue  expected
at the end of the previous financial year. One has to  appreciate  the  fact
that the Free State is performing well compared to other provinces  in  this
respect. The public-private partnership initiatives  to  privatise  some  of
the unutilised beds in the Pelanomi and Universitas hospitals are  on  track
and will,  when  realised,  generate  a  considerable  income  that  can  be
utilised.

Dit alles ten spyt, baat die departement  van  gesondheid  in  die  Vrystaat
geensins finansieel daarby nie, want hulle word  steeds  nog  nie  deur  die
Tesourie toegelaat om eens 'n gedeelte van die inkomste wat ingesamel  word,
te behou om die tekort in die begroting aan te  vul  nie.  Ek  glo  dat  die
nasionale Tesourie se goedkeuring  ook  hiervoor  verkry  moet  word  en  ek
versoek die agb Minister vandag om hierdie geleentheid met die  Tesourie  op
te neem. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[All of this notwithstanding, the department of health  in  the  Free  State
does not at all benefit from it financially,  because  they  are  still  not
permitted by Treasury to keep even  a  part  of  the  collected  revenue  to
replenish the deficit in the budget. I believe that the national  Treasury's
approval for this has to be obtained and I request the  hon  Minister  today
to take this matter up with the Treasury.]

I am aware of the fact that the  total  budget  allocated  to  the  national
Department of Health has not increased in real terms. The New  NP,  however,
appreciates the fact that, in spite of this, based on  what  we  have  heard
from the hon the Minister in her budget speech in the National Assembly  and
listening to her today; it is quite clear that the  national  Department  of
Health is  really  striving  to  improve  its  efficiency.  We  support  the
hospital rehabilitation programme and believe that  the  proper  maintenance
and regular upgrading of the infrastructure in the health sector is  vitally
important for the delivery of good health services and  will  hopefully,  in
future, prevent us from experiencing the pain of hearing  negative  findings
regarding our hospitals, like the findings of the Ethics Institute of  South
Africa, published  in  their  ethics  audit  conducted  on  the  Chris  Hani
Baragwanath Hospital in 2001.

The audit revealed, inter alia, revealed that one of the  largest  hospitals
in the world, with a bed capacity of 3 400 and employing 4 880 people,  with
its dilapidated infrastructure was an unsafe, dirty,  depressing  workplace.
The staff morale was very low because they felt that they were working in  a
second-class hospital - so low that a large percentage of  patients  had  to
bribe the staff for treatment.

The New NP would therefore like to encourage the  Department  of  Health  to
continue with the hospital rehabilitation programme  and,  if  possible,  to
expand the programme. We  also  support  the  expansion  of  the  compulsory
community  service  system.  We  believe  that  the  delivery  of  community
services in the rural and other underserviced areas is imperative.  However,
we want to stress that community service must never be a way to  fill  posts
in major institutions. Community service must never be  seen  as  a  way  to
obtain cheap labour for the state.

My party het ook waardering vir die belangrike optrede wat oor 'n  baie  wye
terrein van stapel gestuur word om MIV/Vigs te bekamp, asook die  beduidende
verhoging in die geld wat vanjaar hiervoor  beskikbaar  gestel  is.  Dit  is
egter ook waar dat van die geld wat  wel  beskikbaar  gestel  word  vir  die
program nie behoorlik aangewend word deur sommige van  die  provinsies  nie.
Beter monitering behoort toegepas te word en stappe behoort geneem  te  word
om dit reg te stel. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[My party also has appreciation for the important actions  launched  over  a
wide terrain to combat HIV/Aids, as well as for  the  considerable  increase
in the money made available for this purpose this year. However, it is  also
true that some of  the  money  made  available  for  the  programme  is  not
properly utilised by some of the provinces. Better  monitoring  should  take
place and steps should be taken to rectify this.]

In conclusion, I would like to say  that  we  shall  not  overcome  HIV/Aids
unless we address poverty, and we shall not beat poverty unless  we  address
the HIV/Aids  pandemic  effectively  and  holistically.  The  fight  against
HIV/Aids has just begun. [Applause.]

Ms M  A  MOTSUMI-TSOPO  (Free  State):  Chairperson,  national  Minister  of
Health, Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, hon  members,  colleagues,  ladies  and
gentlemen, the challenges of poverty that are continuously facing us in  the
country are even more stark in the province that has been  characterised  as
the poorest, the Free State.

It is therefore it is with great delight and appreciation  that  the  people
of this province hear positive messages and see decisive  actions  taken  by
their  elected  representatives  to  push  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty
wherever they exist in our land. This theme  from  the  President's  opening
address in Parliament is in keeping with the realities  in  our  country  in
general and the Free State in particular. We are  glad  that  the  President
has never hesitated to acknowledge this reality.

In her budget speech on 4 June, the hon the Minister, Dr  Manto  Tshabalala-
Msimang did not deviate an inch from this theme laid out by  the  President.
The Minister's budget  speech  also  acknowledges  the  critical  role  that
health can play in poverty alleviation. I stand here to support this  budget
speech of the Minister.

I think that it is  common  knowledge  amongst  us  all  that  equipment  is
another major factor contributing towards quality  service  delivery.  As  a
province, we have made strides in the purchasing  of  equipment  to  advance
our goal of quality service delivery and the betterment of people's lives.

In the last financial year alone we bought equipment to the total  value  of
R136 million for primary health care facilities and hospitals.  Amongst  the
critical equipment we have purchased we can count the  following:  state-of-
the-art computerised tomography equipment  at  Manapo  Hospital  worth  R4,9
million, computerised tomography and floor and suspended Bucky units  and  a
fluoroscopy unit worth R5,6 million at  Pelonomi  Hospital  and  a  magnetic
resonance imaging scanner worth approximately  R14  million  at  Universitas
Hospital.

Infrastructure improvement remains at the top of the list in  the  province.
The clinic upgrading and building programme was an indisputable  success  in
the previous financial year. Currently, 28 projects, of  which  13  are  new
and 15 are upgradings, to the total amount of  R28,428  million,  are  being
undertaken. Most of these projects commenced during January  2002  with  the
construction phase  to  be  completed  by  August  2002.  An  additional  17
projects, which include nine clinics and  eight  upgradings,  will  commence
this financial year.

In the year 2001-02, we continued with the process of  making  underutilised
beds at Pelonomi and Universitas Hospitals available  for  purposes  of  the
private-public partnership initiative. The total fee to be received  by  the
department over 15 years is estimated at R127,2 million. The income will  be
used to upgrade and maintain existing buildings, mainly  Pelonomi  Hospital.
The department is currently finalising negotiations for a 15-year  agreement
with the preferred bidder. National Treasury approval was obtained  and  the
agreement will probably be signed before the end of August 2002.

The development of personnel is one of  our  key  strategies  and  also  the
pillar of our mission statement. It is  therefore  against  this  background
that the department  has  allocated  a  total  of  327  bursaries  to  needy
students in the province. To us, this strategy of bursary allocation  is  an
investment as we hope that the particular  students  will  come  and  plough
back what they have learnt  into  our  province  and  their  communities  in
particular,  especially  the  rural  communities,  where  I  believe  health
services are most needed. In years to come, the impact of this  strategy  on
local communities will be incalculable.

The  department  also  awarded  232  part-time  bursaries  totalling  R1,624
million to its personnel to improve the quality of care as an  incentive  to
employees within the province. The department is  also  in  the  process  of
improving the academic quality  of  health  services  in  the  rest  of  the
province with the objective of the betterment of service delivery.

As a consequence of this factor, we have established a satellite  campus  of
the University of the  Free  State  at  Goldfields  Regional  Hospital.  The
department has appointed two full-time principal  specialists,  three  full-
time  senior  specialists,  two  registrars  and  a  number   of   part-time
specialists to get this programme off the ground. Registrars  in  the  major
disciplines are already rotating through this satellite campus. The  faculty
of health sciences at the University of the Free  State  plans  to  commence
the placement of undergraduate medical students  at  this  satellite  campus
from the 2003 academic year.

The number of cataract operations has increased from 465 in  1999  to  1 790
in 2001, which I believe is a tremendous stride. An  amount  of  R1  million
was made available for  the  development  and  authenticating  of  eye  care
services, with cataract surgery in particular. From January to  April  2002,
516 cataract operations were performed. This shows  a  significant  increase
this year as compared to this time last year. The province is  also  in  the
process  of  establishing  a  sight-saver  centre  at  Manapo  Hospital   in
Phuthaditjhaba and also one in Kroonstad.

In as far as  the  programme  on  disability  is  concerned,  we  have  made
strides. Most of our facilities are currently being  upgraded  to  meet  the
minimum requirements as set out in the  accessibility  assessment  criteria.
Also highlighting our commitment and dedication to the issue  of  disability
is the process we have embarked  upon  for  accelerating  the  provision  of
assistive devices. In  April  we  launched  the  vocational  evaluation  and
rehabilitation  centre,  whose  objective  is   to   benefit   people   with
disabilities in terms of preparation  for  the  job  market.  We  have  also
trained 97 frontline officials in sign language in the last  financial  year
and we are planning to train 291 in this  financial  year  in  collaboration
with the University of the Free State's Unit for Language  Facilitation  and
Employment.

On emergency medical services  and  nonemergency  medical  services  we  are
making breakthroughs. In the last financial year, we were  able  to  procure
once more 53 ambulances - 15 4x4s and 38 2x4s -  21  response  vehicles,  12
rescue vehicles and 19 eight-seater patient transport  vehicles.  The  total
fleet in the Free State is sufficient  for  us  to  deliver  quality  health
services as regards our emergency services.

The tender for the construction of control rooms is currently also with  the
central  procurement  evaluation  committee.  Once  the  tender  process  is
complete, the construction of the control rooms will unfold  in  phases.  We
will also make sure that our communities are  able  to  reach  the  services
whenever they are needed.

With regard to tuberculosis, our battle against the scourge of TB  has  been
rekindled by the  spirit  of  Vukuzenzele  following  a  call  made  by  the
President, Thabo Mbeki, for Letsema. The department has  reached  a  new  TB
cure rate of 68%. The Dots coverage is  at  present  70%,  but  training  is
under way to reach 100% coverage by the end of this financial year. We  have
developed a draft volunteer policy to cater for  the  volunteer  workers  in
the province. This development will certainly assist us  in  increasing  the
TB cure rate to at least 70% by the end of  this  financial  year.  We  will
continue to place TB on top  of  our  priorities  amongst  other  challenges
facing us.

The multiple drug resistance unit  that  we  are  busy  building  at  Moroka
Hospital will be completed by September 2002 and not in  March  2002  as  we
reported last year. The commissioning of this unit will  lead  to  the  Free
State health  department  taking  full  control  of  TB  management  in  the
province.

Child health programmes are some of our  key  programmes.  The  right  of  a
child to health is  basically  given  existence  by  factors  such  as  food
security and nutrition. We are totally aware of the fact that  some  of  the
parents cannot afford to cater for the needs  of  their  children  for  many
reasons. We are therefore providing the necessary assistance as part of  our
endeavour to push back the frontiers of poverty through the  Primary  School
Nutrition Programme, PSNP, and the Protein-Energy Malnutrition Scheme,  PEM.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs, special  delegates  and  hon
members, in making my contribution in  this  debate,  I  wish  to  cite  the
department's statement in which  it  indicates  that  the  current  budget's
theme is ``the reduction  of  poverty  and  vulnerability''.  HIV/Aids  also
features  prominently  in  the  department's  health  policy  and   services
expenditure framework.
The UDM fully supports the initiatives of the department  to  address  these
issues. The substantial increase reflected in the budget  allocation  should
certainly go a long way in attempting to  meet  the  challenges  facing  the
department. The Budget Vote therefore receives our support.

The  South  African  survey  2001-02  offers  some  significant  statistical
insights and valuable information about the state of affairs  in  health  in
the country. To mention but a few: Firstly, South  Africa  has  more  people
living with HIV/Aids than  anywhere  else  in  the  world.  Secondly,  South
Africa's overall health system  performance  was  rated  175th  out  of  191
member states in the World Health  Organisation's  world  health  report  of
2000. Thirdly, the infant mortality rate by race  in  South  Africa  is  the
highest among Africans. Fourthly, unfortunately the Eastern Cape,  which  is
my province, has the  highest  infant  mortality  rate  and  mortality  rate
amongst under-five-year-olds in the country. Incidentally, it is one of  the
poorest provinces in the country.

The key objectives of the department, which are listed as,  amongst  others,
the reduction of morbidity and mortality, the improvement of the quality  of
care and primary health care  and  the  district  health  care  system,  are
therefore all clear indications that the department is fully  aware  of  the
health and other social challenges it faces.  The  briefing  to  the  select
committee  by  the  department  clearly  illustrated  the   programmes   and
strategies that the department has developed to meet its responsibilities.

However, the department also informed the committee about the  inability  to
spend funds of some provinces, as has already been indicated in this  House.
Human resource capacity, management capacity and poor or absence  of  proper
infrastructure were mentioned as some of  the  factors  affecting  spending,
but indications are that the department has  put  monitoring  mechanisms  in
place to look after the problematic provinces. This is encouraging.

The department considered, however,  that  such  monitoring  mechanisms  and
processes would work well where there are effective  back-up  structures  in
the provinces. This is a real challenge for the provinces.

There is therefore an urgent need for effective co-ordination  and  a  joint
strategy by all the state organs responsible  for  the  health,  social  and
economic development of  communities  to  work  together  towards  effective
service delivery. This call was also  echoed  by  the  Alfred  Nzo  District
Council during the provincial week, when it referred to the lack of a  clear
and common understanding  and  an  integrated  approach  among  the  various
levels  of  role-players  responsible  for  championing   service   delivery
programmes in the area.

I am aware that the Department of Health is now focusing on the nodal  areas
and that a nodal strategic initiative  is  being  developed  to  concentrate
specific  programmes  towards  these  nodes.  Therefore  all  obstacles  and
limitations to these plans should be removed. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms B S MOHLAKA (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  Minister  of  Health  hon  Dr
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, hon members and special delegates, thank  you  for
the opportunity afforded to me once more  to  give  my  input  through  this
debate.

First of all let me congratulate the hon  the  Minister  on  her  very  good
speech. I am aware that  we  have  been  given  guidelines  to  follow  when
debating Vote 16. Please pardon  me,  Chairperson,  because,  especially  as
delegates coming from KwaZulu-Natal, we  feel  that  the  issue  of  cholera
should be addressed as well. When  there  was  an  outbreak  of  cholera  in
KwaZulu-Natal, the department was given a  clear  mandate  by  the  national
Government  to  utilise  its  funds  with  the  promise  that  the  national
Government would then reimburse  the  KwaZulu-Natal  department  of  health.
Unfortunately I have to inform the hon the Minister that this has  not  been
the case. A sum of R131 million was an unfunded mandate. It is therefore  my
humble request that KwaZulu-Natal be reimbursed with  R131  million.  Ngithi
okukaKhesari makubuyele kuye uKhesari. [I say what belongs  to  Caesar  must
be given to him.]

The strategic overview and account of key policy developments  from  1998-99
to 2004-05 is appreciated. KwaZulu-Natal is doing its utmost in pushing  the
programmes.

Chairperson, I hope you will give me extra minutes because of the  technical
problems  I  am  experiencing  with  the  sound   system.   [Interjections.]
Chairperson, please protect me. Someone is disturbing me.

It must, however, be pointed out that whilst food  security  programmes  are
implemented, one wonders whether, at the distribution  level,  food  reaches
the deserving learners.

It is encouraging that KwaZulu-Natal home-based care  is  being  implemented
well. However, some level of supervision by community workers  is  necessary
in order to ensure that there is uniformity in the rendering of health  care
in accordance with  set  standards.  The  role  played  by  various  actors,
songwriters, storytellers, umuzi we Zintsizwa,  amongst  others,  should  be
encouraged to facilitate the prevention,  treatment  and  rehabilitation  of
infectious diseases, particularly HIV/Aids.

In conclusion, KwaZulu-Natal is very  proud  that  it  has  trained  a  good
number of forensic nurses  who  are  working  very  hard  at  assisting  the
victims of rape,  gunshots  and  stabbings.  It  is  for  this  reason  that
forensic nurses should be  given  higher  salaries.  Forensic  medicine  was
confined to district surgeons, and now the nurses  are  doing  the  district
surgeons' duties.

One is  not  quite  clear  whether  miscellaneous  expenditure  also  covers
medicolegal claims brought by relatives as the department  suffers  a  gross
shortage of professionals. Because of the efficiency of  the  department  of
health  in  KwaZulu-Natal  and  nationally,   KwaZulu-Natal   finds   itself
overspending  its  allocation.  The   rand-dollar   exchange   rate   is   a
contributing factor because most of  the  hospital  equipment  is  imported.
This includes some drugs.

Let me humbly request you, Chairperson, to allow me to put  on  record  that
KwaZulu-Natal  is  requesting  its  R131  million  owed  by   the   national
Government. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I do not know whether the  hon  member
has cut short her speech, but I think the point has  been  taken  very  well
and that the Minister is actually taking it quite seriously.

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon colleagues, my committee  is
focusing on child poverty in pushing back the  frontiers  of  poverty.  Thus
the state of our children comes to the fore and that  will  be  my  subject:
the situation of health in the Eastern Cape and how it affects the youth.

According to the sources that I consulted, 12  million  children  die  every
year in developing countries. Many of these children die before their  fifth
birthday and many during the first year of life. Seven out of ten  of  these
deaths are  due  to  acute  respiratory  infections,  pneumonia,  diarrhoea,
measles, malnutrition and often a combination of these conditions.

The IMCI, or integrated management of childhood illnesses, is a strategy  to
promote child health and improve  child  survival.  Implementation  of  this
involves the development or improvement of the skills  of  health  staff  by
providing guidelines on  childhood  illnesses  and  appropriate  family  and
community practices. According to my sources,  training  and  implementation
are ongoing in South Africa and, in July 1999, the then Minister  of  Health
and her provincial counterparts declared that the IMCI would be in place  in
every district throughout the country by the end of 2003.

Will this be achieved? I can just say I have my doubts,  and  I  stress  the
point that my doubts concern the Eastern Cape. ``Prevention is  better  than
cure'' is a very old expression but a very apt saying  when  we  talk  about
health care. In our budget there is provision for maternal,  children's  and
women's health. We must make use of the money allocated  and  make  sure  of
the prevention of child morbidity  and  mortality  from  vaccine-preventable
diseases through an effective immunisation programme.

I say again that we know what to do and we set money aside  for  our  needs,
but it seems we do not know how to implement these programmes.

Ons kan seer sekerlik  nie  alles  wat  verkeerd  gaan  met  Suid-Afrika  se
gesondheidsprobleme voor die Minister  se  deur  lê  nie,  maar  sy  behoort
ernstig te besin en aandag te gee aan ons gesondheisdienste  en  instellinge
in   die   Oos-Kaap.   Veral   kinders   en   ouer   mense   sterf,    omdat
gesondheidsdienste  onvoldoende  is  en  hospitale  en  inrigtings  nie  kan
funksioneer  nie.  Daar  is  tekorte  wat  strek  van  swak  en   verouderde
instrumente tot  medisyne-  en  voedseltekorte.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[We most certainly cannot lay everything that is wrong with regard to  South
Africa's health problems at  the  door  of  the  Minister,  but  she  should
seriously contemplate and address our health services  and  institutions  in
the Eastern Cape. Particularly children and older people are  dying  because
health  services  are  inadequate  and  hospitals  and  institutions  cannot
function. There  are  deficiencies  that  range  from  poor  and  antiquated
equipment to medicine and food shortages.]

Our hospitals, clinics and health institutions are in a  shocking  state.  I
have the biggest respect for our nurses, doctors and  health  workers.  They
do the best they can under trying circumstances, but we will  lose  all  our
good people. A good nurse has empathy with her patients  and  will,  in  the
end, not cope with the stress of not being able  to  give  the  patient  the
best, because she was trained to save lives.
Hospitale en inrigtings, veral in die platteland,  word  willens  en  wetens
gesluit. Ek kan vir agb lede  ongelooflike  stories  vertel  van  lyding  en
ellende  wat  ons  kinders  en  oumense  moet  verduur.  In  die  Langkloof,
byvoorbeeld, was  daar  in  'n  stadium  geen  distriksgeneesheer  nie.  Die
hospitaal  is  gesluit  en  is  steeds  net  'n  dagkliniek.  'n   Afgetrede
geneesheer van Jeffreysbaai - ongeveer honderd kilometer van daar af  -  kon
telefonies gekonsulteer word en pasiënte moes  80  km  vervoer  word  na  'n
hospitaal op Humansdorp, waar daar nie die geriewe was vir  die  toestroming
van pasiënte nie. Die mense wat ly en ontberings verduur is die  arm  mense.
Dit is die kinders wat 20 km ver kaalvoet skool  toe  moet  loop.  Terloops,
daar is ook nie skoolbusse nie. Die ambulanse wat die siekes  moet  vervoer,
is óf onpadwaardig óf nie beskikbaar nie, want daar is hopeloos  onvoldoende
vervoer om die siek mense na Humansdorp en Port Elizabeth te vervoer.

As 'n mens dan die begroting bestudeer, word daar genoeg voorsiening  gemaak
vir Gesondheid. Die fout, weer eens, lê by die  implementering  daarvan.  'n
Land se toekoms lê in sy jeug. Dit is verblydend dat  die  aantal  MIV/Vigs-
geïnfekteerde  tieners  'n  merkbare  afname  toon.  Dit  is  egter   totaal
onaanvaarbaar dat tuberkulosehospitale op die drumpel van sluiting  was,  en
maar nog steeds op die gevaarlys is en dit omdat hulle  toelaes  nie  betyds
oorbetaal word nie.

Ons weet almal die agb Minister staan op haar punte en  dat  sy  eintlik  in
die volksmond bekend staan as 'n persoon wat nie nonsens vat nie -  verskoon
my daarvoor. Sy moet nou asseblief so ferm wees in haar optrede wat die Oos-
Kaapse  gesondheid  betref.  Ons  raak  nou  moedeloos  en  skaam  om  altyd
uitgesonder te word as die provinsie wat die swakste presteer. As mense  nie
kan of wil werk nie, moet hulle vervang word. Ons hoop is  op  die  Minister
gevestig. Ons kan nie bekostig om letterlik en figuurlik 'n siek  gemeenskap
te wees nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Hospitals and institutions, especially in  rural  areas,  are  deliberately
being closed. I can tell you unbelievable stories of  suffering  and  misery
that our children and elderly people must endure.  In  the  Langkloof  area,
for example, there was no district surgeon at one stage.  The  hospital  was
closed and is still only a day clinic. A retired doctor from  Jeffrey's  Bay
- approximately a  hundred  kilometres  from  there  -  could  be  consulted
telephonically and patients had to be transported 80 km  to  a  hospital  in
Humansdorp, where there were no facilities for the influx of  patients.  The
people who are suffering and enduring hardship are the poor  people.  It  is
the children who have to walk 20 km to school barefoot. Incidentally,  there
are no school buses either. The ambulances that should transport  those  who
are ill are either unroadworthy or unavailable, because there is  hopelessly
insufficient  transport  to  transport  the  ill  to  Humansdorp  and   Port
Elizabeth.

If one studies the budget, one finds that sufficient provision is  made  for
Health. The problem, once again, is with its implementation. The  future  of
a country is with its youth. It is therefore heartening to note  that  there
is a decrease among HIV/Aids-infected  teenagers.  However,  it  is  totally
unacceptable that tuberculosis hospitals were on the brink of  closure,  and
remain on the danger list, and  that  because  their  grants  are  not  paid
timeously.

We all know that the hon the Minister has firm standpoints and that  she  is
actually widely known as a person who does not take any  nonsense  -  pardon
my saying so. She should please be just as firm  now  in  her  actions  with
regard to health in the Eastern  Cape.  We  are  becoming  disheartened  and
ashamed of always being singled  out  as  the  province  that  performs  the
worst. If people cannot or do not want to work, they should be replaced.  We
place  our  hope  in  the  Minister.  We  cannot   afford,   literally   and
figuratively, to be a sick community.]

We have had enough of incompetence. I am glad that the Minister agrees  that
we cannot afford to be indecisive and  sloppy.  Now  is  the  time  for  the
Minister, as our national Health Minister, to step in and get health in  the
Eastern Cape on a healthy basis.

Aristotle once said these wise words: ``It  is  better  for  a  city  to  be
governed by a good man than  by  good  laws.''We  depend  on  the  Minister.
[Applause.]

Mr M D QWASE (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members  ...
nam mandizibulisele. Ndiyabona ukuba uqhankqalaza nje  lo  mboko  wokuthetha
kungenxa yokuba ifani yam iqala ngo ``Q''. [Kwahlekwa.] [I would  also  like
to greet you. I can see  that  this  microphone  is  boycotting  because  my
surname begins with  a  ``Q''.]  (``boycott''  being  -  ``qhankqalaza''  in
Xhosa). [Laughter.]

I stand here on behalf of the  MEC,  who  could  not  attend  due  to  other
serious commitments within the executive council of  the  province.  I  must
preface my input by describing the context in which we  operate.  The  rural
nature of  the  Eastern  Cape  and  its  historic  infrastructural  backlogs
continue to be among the biggest challenges  facing  the  department.  These
challenges impact negatively on the province as they make it very  difficult
to attract and  retain  skilled  personnel  and,  in  turn,  provide  health
services to the people.

High poverty levels and the growth of  HIV/Aids  strain  the  health  budget
even further. The budget that has been allocated by  the  department  cannot
address all these challenges overnight, and we therefore continue to  engage
the provincial treasury for additional funding to augment the  R3,9  billion
that was budgeted for health in the province in the current financial year.

We have been able to agree with the provincial treasury on  that  additional
funding, as a result of which we will be advertising about  1  400  critical
posts in the  coming  two  weekends.  Amongst  those  adverts  are  653  for
professional nurses, 100  for  middle-management  nurses,  250  for  nursing
assistants, approximately 100 for doctors, including  medical  practitioners
and specialists, and 40 for pharmacists. Over and above  these  posts  there
are posts for managerial positions within the province  to  ensure  that  we
strengthen the province.
By the end of September we hope to have filled the  posts,  in  the  process
alleviating the shortage  of  staff  and,  in  turn,  improving  the  health
services in our institutions. This will also assist  in  and  alleviate  the
burden on those committed health workers in those institutions, and  address
the question of the brain drain that results from this high burden in  those
institutions.

As  I  have  indicated  earlier,  HIV/Aids  is  also  one  of  the  critical
challenges facing the province. We have integrated  the  HIV/Aids  programme
into the health system so that it is not seen  as  a  stand-alone  programme
within the programmes of the health department.

As I speak, 203 midwives and five doctors have been trained  in  counselling
and testing. They have also been trained  in  the  management  of  Caesarean
operations to ensure that mother-to-child  transmission  is  limited.  There
has also been 15-day training sessions for 18 counsellor trainers  for  nine
health districts. The VCT sites have been extended from 8  to  74,  and  are
now available in  all  six  district  municipalities  in  the  province.  In
addition, 107 counsellors are continually being trained.

With regard to the prevention of mother-to-child  transmission,  as  I  said
earlier, we have also  trained  these  midwives  and  doctors  not  only  in
testing and counselling, but also in the  management  of  Caesarean  section
operations. The PMTCT prevention of  mother-to-child  transmission  -  sites
have been extended to two more sites, that is the Dora  Nginza  Hospital  in
Port Elizabeth and the Holy Cross Hospital in Flagstaff as well as to  their
surrounding clinics. This means therefore that we have  five  hospitals  and
87 clinics that are now providing PMTCT, the  five  arising  from  the  fact
that the Makiwane and the Frere Hospitals are two hospitals in one  complex.


With respect to home-based care, in 2002 alone  14  home-based  care  master
trainers were trained, and the national integrated plan pilot sites on home-
based care in Mhlakulo and Butterworth which are in operation. The  province
is intending to expand to three more sites, at Sterkspruit,  Humansdorp  and
Maluti. We have also distributed home-based care kits  to  those  home-based
care-givers. In our budget we have set aside money  to  purchase  additional
kits for that purpose.

With regard to sexually transmitted infections, 90% of primary  health  care
facilities are using the syndromic approach to STI management. Male  condoms
are available at all clinics and, with respect to female condoms,  20  pilot
sites are in place, and the province is planning to increase the  number  of
sites even more.

The HIV/Aids and STI programmes are complemented through  communication  and
social mobilisation such as radio talk shows, adverts,  awareness  campaigns
and partnerships with various stakeholders. As I have indicated, one of  the
critical issues that is affecting the province is the high poverty level  so
the primary nutrition programme is meant to address that.

The department is in the process of eliminating the bureaucracy within  that
programme to ensure that the  poorest  women  and  children  on  the  ground
benefit most from that programme. As  we  have  a  number  of  stakeholders,
suppliers and NGOs we find that the poor children and women  on  the  ground
do not benefit in that process. We want to  eliminate  that  chain  so  that
those on the ground benefit most and that  the  poverty  on  the  ground  is
addressed. The decentralisation of control to  district  municipalities  and
SGBs will also ensure an intersectoral approach,  women  empowerment,  cost-
effectiveness and efficiency in the management of that programme. The  joint
venture  with  the  departments  of  agriculture,  social  development   and
economic affairs is critical also in addressing  the  challenge  of  poverty
and malnutrition in the province. Health alone is unable  to  address  that.
We are working closely with these  departments  in  the  social  cluster  to
address this.

I want also to touch  on  hospital  services  and  management  support.  The
Cohsasa, Council  for  Health  Service  Accreditation  in  Southern  Africa,
programme in 19 hospitals  in  the  former  Transkei  has  yielded  positive
results and will now be extended to other hospitals  in  the  province.  The
process of putting up IT infrastructure will be complete in 70 hospitals  by
the end of the financial year. That  will  improve  information  management,
the  general  management  of  these  institutions,  monitoring  and  revenue
collection.

The appointment of the  outstanding  CEOs,  senior  executive  officers  and
executive officers in these prioritised hospitals will be finalised  by  the
end of September so that we beef  up  and  strengthen  management  at  these
hospitals. The province is also looking at  reinforcing  management  systems
by engaging external bodies  with  management  skills  in  the  three  major
complexes, that is in the Umtata, East London and Port Elizabeth  complexes.


I must also touch on infrastructure development. The R231 million meant  for
new  facilities,  upgrading  and  maintenance  will  see  us   through   the
finalisation stages of the Nelson  Mandela  Academic  Hospital;  enable  the
replacement of 42 old clinics with new ones;  facilitate  new  additions  to
both hospitals and  clinics;  finance  57  projects  for  the  upgrading  of
hospitals arising from the conditional grant of  R81  million;  and  provide
for the general maintenance of lifts, boilers, refrigerators and  mortuaries
that always have problems, especially in those hospitals.

Linked to the above is  the  process  of  outsourcing  the  distribution  of
pharmaceutical  and  medical  suppliers  and  management  support  for   the
provincial  pharmaceutical  depots.  Adverts  calling  for  expressions   of
interest were out by April, closing in the middle of May 2002  and  we  will
follow the necessary  procurement  procedures  up  to  the  signing  of  the
contract agreement stage before the end of the  financial  year.  This  will
improve the management and supply of drugs to the institutions, address  the
question of pilferage and also save a lot  of  funds  for  other  programmes
within the department.

I must say, in conclusion, that the budget will never  be  enough  to  cover
our demands and challenges, but with effective utilisation of the  resources
at our disposal, we will make a great impact  on  the  provision  of  health
services to our people in the province. We are on course. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  MECs  present,  hon  cadres,
ladies and gentlemen, my apologies  for  speaking  on  behalf  of  the  MEC,
Comrade Dipuo Peters. She is also tied up in the Cabinet meeting.

The President of the country, Mr Thabo Mbeki or Comrade Thabo Mbeki, in  his
state of the nation address called upon the nation  to  volunteer  its  time
and  expertise.  Never  before  have  we  witnessed  such   enthusiasm   and
commitment by a nation. Men  and  women  and  the  youth  of  this  province
responded magnificently when the call was  made.  They  have  on  their  own
integrated the spirit of the volunteers of old into  their  work  and  daily
lives. When I speak about this I am talking about the Northern Cape.

In 1999 the Northern Cape Department of Health vowed to  achieve  excellent,
holistic, people-centred and affordable health care. A year ago  we  pledged
vigorously to improve the quality of service rendered to our people  and  to
improve them over time. This dream is being realised  stage  by  stage.  Our
goal remains a primary health care-driven service with  a  defined  referral
path for those patients who require higher levels of care. To this  end,  we
are strengthening primary care service  through  our  24-hour  service,  and
expanding the  service  platform  with  the  introduction  of  an  effective
community-based and home-based care platform.

Various priority programmes, such as those  on  HIV/Aids,  tuberculosis  and
maternal, child and women's health are incorporated into the primary  health
care delivery model. In order to ensure a referral path, we have  identified
hospitals that provide different levels  of  care.  In  particular,  we  are
improving tertiary level services  at  the  Kimberley  Hospital  complex  to
ensure access to these services by all patients in this province.
The department of health in our province has previously committed itself  to
decreasing overexpenditure and has left no stone unturned in achieving  this
goal, while rendering the  highest  quality  of  service.  The  department's
overspending trend was as follows: in 1999-2000, it was  R46,6  million  and
in 2000-01 it  was  R17,5  million.  Hon  members  can  see  the  trend  for
themselves.

Medical inflation, which is significantly higher  than  the  consumer  price
index, has a profound impact on our expenditure. This has also  impacted  on
the expenditure trend of medicines and medical and surgical  sundries  which
continue to be significantly higher than that of the previous year.

The scourge of HIV/Aids will therefore have  a  significant  impact  on  our
resources,  with  the  number  of  patients  presenting  with  opportunistic
diseases  and  our  treatment  protocols  of   these   infectious   diseases
increasing the medicine bills.

The allocation to district health service is R316,093 million. In  order  to
implement the 24-hour policy at clinic level R2 million has  been  allocated
to personnel; to address capital deadlocks R5,5 million has  been  allocated
to emergency medical services; and R2,5 million has been allocated  to  fund
the two-crew ambulance system.

The province's health department's capital spending  is  derived  from  both
the equitable share and conditional grants. Envisaged capital  projects  for
this financial year are the following: primary health care centres  will  be
built at Galeshewe and Platfontein. The Kuyasa and Lowryville  Clinics  will
be completed. Regarding the new Colesberg Hospital  project,  a  sod-turning
ceremony was held on 23 April 2002. Earthwork will commence  during  August,
with the actual construction beginning by  October.  The  expected  date  of
completion is towards  the  end  of  2003.  The  cost  of  this  project  is
estimated at R15 million.

The planning of a new hospital in Calvinia  will  start  during  this  year,
with the intention to commence construction in the next financial year.  The
Kimberley Hospital complex will procure a CAT scanner to  the  value  of  R7
million. Expenditure on the hospital information system will amount to  R1,1
million. Provincial hospital services have been  allocated  R3  million  for
the procurement of medical equipment. Emergency medical services  have  been
allocated R4 million for the procurement of 20 ambulances  and  15  vehicles
to transport patients.

In the real spirit of Masakhane, a culture of payment for service, has  been
cultivated among our people. Revenue increase can be directly linked to  the
introduction  of  our   private-preference   beds   in   our   institutions.
Politicians - hon members, I repeat, politicians - and  senior  managers  in
the provincial administration are using public health facilities as  far  as
possible. We want to encourage all public servants to follow suit.

With the implementation of  the  national  policy  aiming  to  increase  the
capacity of hospitals, the Kimberley Hospital has improved quality  of  care
in all facets of service delivery.

Two conditional grants, namely the grants for the distribution  of  tertiary
services  and  for  hospital   reconstruction   and   rehabilitation,   were
successfully  utilised  to  upgrade  the  hospital.  The   front   entrance,
specialist clinic and pharmacy were upgraded.

We are consequently revisiting previous  proposals  for  hospitals  such  as
Garies, Postmasburg and Hartswater. These  proposals  were  delayed  because
further  investigation  into  Colesberg  and   Calvinia   necessitated   the
construction of new hospitals with higher costs.

Jan Kempdorp Hospital will become the TB  hospital  for  the  Frances  Baard
district. Services at Jan  Kempdorp  Hospital  will  therefore  include  the
following: a 50-bed TB facility, a 24-hour casualty  and  10-bed  in-patient
facility and maternity  services.  A  major  constraint  is  the  difficulty
attracting nurses to the rural and most remote areas  of  the  province  and
retaining them there. This limits our ability to ensure  optimal  access  to
certain services.

The life-skills programme, with the Department of Education as  the  primary
implementing department, is being implemented both in  and  outside  school.
Life-skills is a  major  programme  which  attempts  to  change  the  sexual
behaviour of young people, both those at school and  those  out  of  school.
The education department expects to train 40 master trainers in  life-skills
during this year.

The voluntary counselling and testing programme  was  provincially  launched
on 26 April 2002 in the Frances Baard district. At present we have 42  sites
in the province.

Community-based organisations  were  at  the  forefront  of  mobilising  our
people to live  in  a  healthy  way.  The  response  of  the  Northern  Cape
communities was overwhelming, and, still  today,  food  security,  nutrition
and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle  are  vigorously  promoted  amongst
our communities. Individual communities take it upon themselves to create  a
better life for themselves. Indeed, Letsema is  a  call  to  our  people  to
enter into partnerships with government, to reconstruct and  develop  for  a
better and brighter future.

A major contributor to household food  security  is  the  primary  nutrition
programme funded from conditional grants. A total of 314 schools,  with  110
000 learners, benefit from school-feeding committees  at  all  participating
schools, with training in financial control measures.

The following projects were funded during the previous financial  year:  the
Kakamas food garden,  the  Kimberley  Hospital  breast-feeding  launch,  the
Kalahari crèche feeding scheme and the Sundra food garden.

The Red Cross  Society  is  assigned  the  responsibility  to  provide  food
parcels to 100 destitute families affected and infected by HIV ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr D M KGWARE: Thank you, sir. I had a lot to say. [Applause.]

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, Minister, hon members, as the ruling  party  we
knew that we would have enormous challenges  in  bringing  about  equity  in
health. We also knew that the majority of our people in our communities  did
not have  access  to  health  services  and  that  obviously  we  needed  to
immediately set about rectifying those wrongs.

In 1994, no one had done  a  cost  estimate  that  came  anywhere  near  the
actuality of how expensive the exercise of equity would be. Nowhere  is  the
gross underestimation of cost clearer than with  the  impact  that  HIV  and
Aids have on our lives and on our country. Over the last few years, we  have
become more sophisticated in our knowledge of  these  conditions  and  their
causes, effects and potential  remedies.  Therefore  our  costing  estimates
have improved considerably.
With each new piece  of  information  the  Government  had  to  improve  its
strategies. The department had to look at the backlogs  of  cases,  staffing
requirements and capacity priorities that needed to be reversed in order  to
accommodate the new paradigms.

The department's approach gradually took  on  a  multipronged  format  which
focused on boosting the immune systems of  those  already  infected  by  the
disease. We looked at improving the nutritional levels of poor  patients  in
particular through nutritional programmes that would  enable  them  to  take
their drugs. We looked at preventive measures such  as  condom  distribution
and  informing  communities  through  awareness   programmes   focusing   on
monogamous relationships,  and  finally  we  have  to  continue  to  conduct
ongoing research into a vaccine that will prevent the disease  from  killing
any more people.

The impact of HIV and Aids is indeed far-reaching. We heard  last  year  and
the year before exactly how each province was affected by the prevalence  of
HIV and Aids. All of us noted with dismay that  KwaZulu-Natal,  of  all  the
provinces, had the highest  prevalence  rate.  As  a  result,  we  were  all
collectively concerned that we would not be able to overcome the  challenges
that faced us, and we feared for the future of our youth.

I believe that we are better equipped today to deal with the  HIV  and  Aids
pandemic, especially if one refers to the findings of the recent  report  of
the 12th national  HIV  seroprevalence  survey  of  women  attending  public
antenatal clinics in South Africa, released on 10 June this year.  According
to the survey, the overall  national  statistics  show  that  there  was  an
increase from 24,5% in the year 2000 to 24,8% in 2001. Because the  increase
was so insignificant, the department is confident that the  prevalence  rate
has stabilised. More significantly,  as  a  measurement  for  the  continued
success of our intervention strategy, the  survey  shows  that  in  KwaZulu-
Natal, where the department has focused its attention, there was  a  notable
decrease from 36,2% in 2000 to 33,5%. The intervention strategy employed  by
the department focused  on  young  people  has  also  been  shown  to  be  a
successful one, as proven by the 5% decrease in  prevalence  among  pregnant
women under the age of 20.

This Government has shown that it can forge ahead  quietly  but  powerfully.
We faced the challenges of negative media attention around  our  President's
position on the cause of Aids and the distribution  of  nevirapine  to  HIV-
positive women, among many others. Despite all the negative  publicity,  our
people  now  know  about  the  important  programmes,  such   as   voluntary
counselling and testing and home-based care, thereby ensuring that  HIV  and
Aids are everybody's business, and not something to be hidden  in  a  corner
somewhere. Of course there is still work to be done to  remove  the  stigma,
but all the information out there makes disclosure easier by the day.

The other battle that the Government won with regard to HIV and Aids was  to
bring   about    intersectoral    co-operation    between    community-based
organisations,  nongovernmental  organisations,  faith-based  organisations,
the SAPS, traditional  healers,  business,  agriculture,  local  government,
traditional leaders and educators.

Our interaction on the continent has also raised our own  awareness  of  HIV
in Africa. Joint projects under the auspices of Nepad  have  looked  at  co-
operation to bring relief to the estimated 2,4  million  Africans  currently
at an advanced stage of the HIV disease.

It was found that globally, the resources,  including  financial  resources,
are available to meet the  challenge  and  to  launch  a  full  spectrum  of
responses required to fight HIV and Aids. The only  challenge  that  remains
is to mobilise these resources.

In South Africa the challenge is the same. We have the  financial  resources
to find a vaccine and educate our people. What  remains  is  to  effectively
manage those financial resources. We are convinced that  the  Government  is
fully aware of the current challenges and prepared to do whatever  it  takes
to eliminate the scourge of HIV and Aids.
In each of the strategies of the Department of Health, the  focus  has  been
on saving lives or at least prolonging and improving the quality of life  of
those who are already infected. To us as the ANC,  every  South  African  is
valuable and therefore irreplaceable.

We want to see, as has been our goal from the beginning, an increase in  the
number of HIV-positive pregnant  women  taking  nevirapine  so  that  unborn
children are offered as much protection as humanly possible. We  would  like
to see people change the bad sexual  habits  of  a  lifetime  and  also  use
condoms for protection. We want to see our people  engaged  in  agricultural
endeavours that will make them eat healthy meals. We should try our best  to
be the first country to discover a  vaccine  for  Aids.  We  know  that  the
disease is a tragic reality, and  not  a  figment  of  someone's  overactive
imagination. We are all committed to treating it as such.

The department should  continue  its  intersectoral  and  interregional  co-
operation to overcome HIV and Aids. [Applause.]

Dr R A M SALOOJEE  (Gauteng):  Mr  Chairman,  South  Africa,  with  most  of
Africa, is deeply mired in poverty. Do all South Africans really  understand
the extent and depth  of  the  problem?  Are  the  measures  we  are  taking
effective enough to make the  kind  of  interventions  that  will  create  a
sustainable difference to the lives of the people, in  both  the  short  and
the long term? Do we, as South Africans, have the collective will to  tackle
the problem, which should be  at  the  heart  of  our  concerns  and  deeply
embedded in our social conscience, and to pull together?

There is no simple or concise definition  to  describe  poverty.  The  World
Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen in  March  1995  defined  it  as
follows:


  Poverty has  many  manifestations,  including  the  lack  of  income  and
  productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods; hunger
  and malnutrition; ill-health; limited or lack of access to education  and
  other basic services; increased morbidity  and  mortality  from  illness;
  homelessness and  inadequate  housing;  unsafe  environments  and  social
  discrimination and exclusion. It is  also  characterised  by  a  lack  of
  participation in decision-making and in civil, social and cultural life.

It is evident from this that poverty alleviation and eradication  require  a
multidisciplinary approach, but  these  cannot  and  must  not  function  in
isolation,  as  single  and  separate  disciplines.  In   order   to   avoid
inefficiencies,  wastage  of  resources  and  duplication  of  services,  an
intersectoral, integrated and multipronged approach must be implemented.

We note that Government's project development and programming are now  based
on integrated development planning and organised clusters. We hope,  through
these realistic  and  pragmatic  ways  of  operating,  we  can  obviate  the
negative outcomes resulting from poor management, disjointed  implementation
and the very real lack of available human resources and expertise.

We cannot limit the need for poverty alleviation and eradication within  the
confines of provincial borders. Poverty is a national tragedy of  gargantuan
proportions. Even if some provinces are able to deal with some of  the  many
issues with meaningful levels of  success  and  are  able  to  meet  success
targets, the impact of levels of poverty in the rest of  the  country  might
make this a Pyrrhic victory and one of short duration.

It is estimated that 13 million South  Africans  are  subsisting  under  the
poverty datum line. The additional  impact  of  mass  urbanisation,  illegal
immigration  and  refugees  worsens  the  situation.  We  must  also  remind
ourselves that South Africa is not an  island.  We  must  be  aware  of  the
effects of transnational poverty, particularly in other sub-Saharan  African
countries, and the ghastly consequences of drought, famine,  starvation  and
political  turmoil  in  Southern  Africa,  where  another  13  million   are
currently under threat of hunger and social catastrophe.

We cannot minimise  the  impending  disaster  facing  our  country  and  the
African continent. We know that every effort is being made to  grapple  with
the issues of economic stagnation and  the  harrowing  double  standards  on
which  the  unequal  relationship  between  the  developed,  developing  and
underdeveloped worlds is based. We  form  part  of  a  continent  where  the
consequences of this are the gravest and are further fuelled by the  endemic
political insecurity that continues to plague many regimes in Africa.

The United Nations  Global  Environmental  Outlook  report  recently  issued
gives an Armageddon-like perspective on what life on earth will be  like  by
the year 2032, and maybe even earlier in parts of Africa, if we do not  mend
our ways and if a united, unselfish and sincere commitment is not only  made
but effectively pursued and  implemented  in  facing  the  multifaceted  yet
integral and all-pervasive calamities of poverty, leading to a bleak  future
which is not only to ghastly to contemplate but also grisly to comprehend.

One of the assessments this report makes is that unless  the  world  changes
its current market-first approach, the survival of  the  essential  element,
which allows life to exist, will  be  seriously  compromised.  We  in  South
Africa who will host the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development  will  be
involved in finding collective solutions to  an  ever-increasing  diminution
of resources which will need crucial interventions  and  critical  decisions
to save millions of lives.

We are currently facing a crisis with the HIV epidemic, and  added  to  this
we have to contend with opportunistic  infections,  including  tuberculosis,
malaria and sexually transmitted diseases, and an ongoing  collapse  of  the
moral mores of our society. We have been spending too much of our energy  in
talking at cross purposes on the issue of HIV/Aids, which  has  resulted  in
mixed messages to  the  broad  masses  of  vulnerable  people  whose  immune
systems have been fatally ravaged.
We know that at present there is no cure for the HIV infection and  no  real
medical deterrent. We also accept that in cases of  viruses,  regardless  of
which strains, the only possible cure is finding  appropriate  vaccines.  We
know that present research into  finding  a  vaccine  or  a  combination  of
vaccines for the treatment of the different types or  subtypes  of  mutating
viruses causing Aids is still in the experimental stage, and  it  will  take
years or decades before we  can  even  claim  its  efficacy  as  a  form  of
effective treatment.

We also know that  antiretrovirals  are  a  temporary,  stopgap,  palliative
measure, which may prolong life and improve the quality of life.  Just  like
other drug treatments, such as chemotherapy in cancer cases,  it  definitely
has a place in certain defined circumstances of the disease phase,  and  has
a place in the total scheme of  treatment  protocols,  but  it  is  not  the
panacea for eradicating the scourge. Over  95%  of  the  programme  for  the
prevention and spread of the disease  is  still  based  on  issues  of  safe
sexual behaviour, awareness programmes,  education,  counselling,  voluntary
testing,  balanced  nutrition,  boosting   the   immune   system,   treating
opportunistic infections and minimising sexually transmitted diseases.

I  have  never  had  any   reservations   about   the   judicious   use   of
antiretrovirals  in  appropriate  circumstances,  but  I  also  believe   in
seriously taking into account, not the views  of  the  dissidents,  but  the
caution proposed by responsible and knowledgeable  physicians  who  say  the
following:


  The complexity and toxicity of treatment means that  the  prescribing  of
  antiretrovirals needs to be concentrated in specialised services, such as
  HIV infectious disease units and sexual health  services,  and  GPs  with
  significant  caseloads  who  have  undergone  special  training  in   HIV
  medicine.

This  would  include  knowledge  of  side  effects  of   ARTV   agents   and
interactions with other drugs commonly used in  primary  care,  and  careful
counselling regarding testing and  the  interpretation  of  the  results  of
testing, risk factors and confidentiality. The  path  to  success  is  often
strewn with poisonous uncertainties. Monitoring has to be exhaustive  rather
than flippant and cursory. The use of postexposure administration  in  cases
of  occupational   exposures,   for   example   needlestick   injuries,   or
nonoccupational exposures, such as rape or condom  breakage,  are  based  on
plausibility rather that any convincing evidence of benefit.  The  issue  of
resistance, toxicity, the impact  of  infection,  and  the  treatment  under
general medical care and interactions  between  common  drugs  and  anti-HIV
drugs, merits comprehensive understanding and knowledge.

As the spectre of poverty visibly deepens through unemployment,  hunger  and
social  disintegration,  coupled  with  the  incremental  corrosion  of  the
physical and psychological fulfilment of life, replaced by pain,  starvation
and  agony,  leaving  millions  perilously  in   the   twilight   zones   of
hopelessness and terminal wretchedness, our social  cohesion  as  a  nation,
battered by crime, mounting numbers of  Aids  orphans  and  sexually  abused
women and children,  and  rising  tides  of  malnourished,  alcoholic,  drug
dependent, hopeless and  mentally  stunted  fellow  citizens,  families  and
neighbours, should arouse in all of us, as South Africans, a sense of  guilt
and determination to mobilise into an army to declare  war  on  poverty  and
its deeply rooted  dehumanising  outcomes.  Our  barbed  wire  fences,  high
walls, burglar alarms and security gates  will  not  shield  us  from  being
affected by the horror suffered by the victims of poverty.

Too early in our democracy most of us have latched onto the rights given  to
us by the Constitution,  without  first  paying  attention  to  healing  the
chronically festering wounds of deprivation, denial and indignity which  are
crippling the birth of  an  emerging  national  ethico-moral  ethos  in  our
society. Should we not, as  a  nation,  first  plant  the  foundation  of  a
caring, harmonious, compassionate and emancipating social order, instead  of
the rhetoric and self-righteous  chest-thumping  adversarial  behaviour  and
posturing of many of our citizens?

Should we  not  be  working  together,  rather  than  carping  and  dividing
constituencies and communities? Should we not be  consolidating  that  which
we already have as social security safety nets, by  enrolling  and  bringing
into the fold those who should  benefit  from  pensions  for  the  aged  and
support and foster grants for children, the  disabled  and  the  frail,  and
working  diligently  in  providing  urgently   needed   job   creation   and
employment, which can fund and feed those desperately in need  of  immediate
assistance, coupled with massive skilling programmes?

We must not be bogged down by interminable  seminars  and  workshops  whilst
resources remain  untapped,  or  have  a  bureaucracy  which  is  unable  or
unwilling   to   translate   policies   and   programmes   into    efficient
implementation, whilst others wantonly  plunder  the  public  purse  through
corruption and fraudulent  procurement  practices.  The  political  will  to
fasten  onto  the  prospect  of  relief  and  hope  must  become  our  clear
imperative for change.

Whilst a long-term vision and missions are vital  for  sustainable  success,
we have to have immediate restorative and attack  action  plans  which  will
contain and stem the immediate dangers and  fatal  haemorrhaging  caused  by
the pestilence of poverty. I think  that  is  the  national  ethos  and  the
national vision which we should be  following,  rather  than  the  divisions
that exist among us. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs and  special  delegates
and colleagues, it is estimated that some 40% of all South Africans live  in
poverty and that a large proportion of them live in the rural  areas,  where
health facilities are least developed. This problem  is  further  aggravated
by the failure of agricultural projects due to climatic conditions  and  the
lack of the necessary resources. In such a situation, we are agreed and  are
supportive of the fact that the Government of the day  cannot  and  may  not
fold its arms and bemoan the situation.

It must rise to the occasion. It must take the  monster  by  the  horns.  It
cannot afford to  see  our  people  being  devastated  by  poverty  and  our
womenfolk  bearing  emaciated  children,  as  happens   elsewhere   on   our
continent. So the allocation of funds to  alleviate  this  distress  is  not
negotiable. It is also not a privilege but an imperative. It  is  gratifying
to note the amount allocated for this  purpose.  However,  the  monster  has
grown so large and out of proportion that consideration should be  given  to
increasing the allocation so as to deal the monster a  devastating  blow  to
the nose.

Consideration must also be  given  to  the  fact  that  poverty  alleviation
cannot be managed if it  is  attacked  from  one  front  only.  It  must  be
attacked from all sides. The health facilities in the rural  areas  must  be
adequately supplied on a regular basis with the necessary medical  supplies.
This would bring about an improvement in the quality of life of our  people.


Another  threatening  monster  in  our  communities  is  the  prevalence  of
HIV/Aids. This issue has been the subject of a hot  and  acrimonious  debate
in the media, and the battle is far from won. My party, whilst  appreciating
this allocation, is in support of the  supply  of  antiretroviral  drugs  to
pregnant mothers at  all  suitable  and  ready  hospitals  as  a  matter  of
urgency.

One disturbing issue I need  to  refer  to  in  my  province,  although  not
directly the responsibility of this department,  is  indirectly  related  to
it. At a school in the far west of Mafikeng, there is the problem of a  lack
of toilet facilities. The learners have to go over the fence  into  a  thick
forest on the Botswana side of the border to relieve  themselves.  The  area
is teeming with python which threaten them, and the whole area is  a  health
hazard.

However,  it  is  hoped  that  the  relevant  department,  to   which   some
representations have been made, will heed our cry. My  party  supports  this
Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr R MASHABA (Northern Province): Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  members,
we would like to thank you for the opportunity you have given us to  present
our views on the challenges of health care delivery in the  country  and  in
particular in our province. We accept  it  as  a  necessary  aspect  of  our
responsibility to express our profound  gratitude  to  the  leadership  role
that the NCOP continues to play in  ensuring  that  our  challenges  in  the
provinces remain on the national agenda.

As we have seen previously in  several  other  encounters,  ours  remains  a
province that is characterised  by  unsatisfactory  levels  of  service  and
socioeconomic disparities. Those are the challenges that continue  to  haunt
our population, of whom 89% are rural, 54% are women,  36,9%  are  aged  and
46% fulfil the definition of ``unemployed''.

With 44 public hospitals and 477 clinics in  the  province,  our  department
continues to do everything possible  to  provide  health  care  services  to
these communities that we have  just  described  to  the  honourable  House.
During the  past  eight  years  or  so,  we  have  relatively  succeeded  in
broadening   the   accessibility   of   services   to   these   communities,
notwithstanding the  very  serious  challenges  of  insufficient  resources,
dilapidated facilities and  a  generally  disintegrated  and  underdeveloped
infrastructure.

We mention these factors because, one way or the other, they partly,  though
significantly, explain why the department is currently able to  provide  24-
hour service in only 183 of the 477 clinics in the  province,  because  they
better explain why we are unable to provide adequate security at the  health
facilities, as well as satisfactory levels of care to our communities,  and,
of course, because they better explain why we can  afford  to  provide  only
60% of medicines in the clinics.

Similarly, we mention these constraints  because  they  continue  to  impact
negatively on our capacity to  confront  the  scourge  of  HIV/Aids  in  the
province. The pressures associated with programmes of prevention of  mother-
to-child transmission of HIV/Aids, care for victims of  sexual  assault  and
care for children affected and infected, and the need to robustly  implement
the five-year strategic plan, definitely demand of Government to  capacitate
personnel and improve the capacity of our facilities.

We will  continue  to  hammer  on  the  serious  problem  of  infrastructure
because, as a result of the province's bad road networks, our ambulances  do
not last  long  and  because,  by  virtue  of  the  inadequacy  or  lack  of
sanitation and water facilities,  our  poor  communities  continuously  live
under  the  real  threat  of  a  cholera  epidemic  and  other  unacceptable
conditions. Quite obviously, our very constrained resources  are  struggling
to address the many and varied expectations that result  from  the  pathetic
socioeconomic status that characterises our province.

Whereas we are doing  better  relatively  in  terms  of  our  capital  works
budget, which is mainly from national conditional grants,  the  majority  of
the health facilities in the province  remain  dilapidated.  The  provincial
allocation has declined from R190 million in 1998-99 to R21 million  in  the
2000-01 financial year, while conditional grants have increased  from  R24,4
million in 1998-99 to R92 million in 2001-02.

These allocations are significant, and yet  they  will  not  necessarily  be
able to address the enormous infrastructural problems that we have  in  some
of  the  institutions.  For  instance,  Nkhensani,  Lebowakgomo,  Zebediela,
Dilokong and Jane Furse Hospitals are still fragmented and do not provide  a
comprehensive service. In some cases a paediatric ward is about  5  km  from
other wards. It is estimated that in  order  to  have  all  these  hospitals
relocated and for them to reach a stage of  comprehensive  service,  capital
expenditure of about R200 million is needed. We continue to emphasise  these
realities because we believe that they should inform strategic  thinking  at
all levels of policy debate and formulation.

As we confront  and  honestly  engage  with  these  issues,  we  also  learn
valuable  lessons  that  will  definitely  take  our  country  forward.  For
instance, progress that is beginning to be registered as  a  result  of  the
Government's integrated development strategy and other initiatives at  local
level clearly serves as an indication that through  a  collective  sense  of
determination, mutual understanding and  collaboration  we  can  succeed  in
unravelling some of these problems.

We have learned through the past few years that rather than throwing up  our
hands in despair, we can wisely and optimally utilise our limited  resources
in the best interests of our people. As a result of this attitude,  we  have
managed to maintain a  relatively  positive  indicator  in  so  far  as  the
general health status of the province is concerned. This has been  reflected
by, amongst other things, the rate  of  infant  mortality,  which  decreased
from 57 per 1 000 live births in  1994  to  37,2  in  2001,  the  under-five
mortality rate, which decreased from 83 per 1 000 live births in 1994 to  53
in 2001 and the maternal mortality rate, which dropped from  53  to  30  per
100 000 live births during the same period.

In terms of its morbidity rate, the province  is  doing  relatively  better,
with the average reported cases of TB standing at 40  per  100  000  in  the
population, and with malaria at 65, typhoid  at  1,7,  measles  at  5,6  and
viral hepatitis at 2,7. We believe  that  with  determination  and  courage,
coupled with adequate resources, we can do even better.

In spite  of  these  achievements,  the  province  occasionally  experiences
various downsides, some of which have been making the  most  sensational  of
media headlines in the country. We have been firm and principled in  dealing
successfully with the problems of  shrinkage,  corruption,  impropriety  and
general ill-discipline in the institutions and the department  as  a  whole.
It is for this reason that in the period ranging from 1 July 1999  to  date,
we succeeded in dismissing no fewer than 89 of  our  employees  for  various
serious offences, whilst a substantial number have  also  been  given  final
written warnings. We implement all these measures not  out  of  malice,  but
because we have a moral and constitutional responsibility to protect  public
resources and the public interest.

To further enhance the capacity of the department to address some  of  these
challenges and, as such, improve conditions of service, a process  is  being
embarked upon to  realise  the  appointment  of  competent  chief  executive
officers who will better administer and manage  public  health  institutions
in the province. It is  expected  that  those  CEOs  will  sign  performance
management agreement and receive, amongst other things, the human  resources
and the  financial  and  procurement  delegations  so  as  to  manage  their
institutions effectively.

As we capacitate our service points, we are also ensuring  that  we  do  not
neglect the responsibility of devolving relevant  health  care  services  to
the local level. Accordingly, we remain part  of  national,  provincial  and
local efforts that  are  aimed  at  clearly  defining  these  processes  and
developing an enabling framework within which these  functions  have  to  be
devolved.

We have also been worried by the fact that in  the  past  year,  indications
were beginning to emerge of a downward trend  the  impact  of  our  expanded
programme  on  immunisation.  We  are,  however,   confident   that   robust
interventions such as the SADC-inspired launch of  the  polio  certification
committee, which took place recently in our province, will  serve  to  steer
our courage and determination to succeed. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr P MEYER (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon  Minister  of  Health  Dr  Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, I would like to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the
Minister very much for the keen interest that she has taken in  the  Western
Cape,  especially  the  Red  Cross  Children's  Hospital,  this  year.   The
personnel are most gratified and the Minister has helped and  inspired  them
during these difficult times.

The mission of my department in the Western Cape is to  promote  the  health
of the people of the Western Cape and beyond. This is exactly what  the  Red
Cross Children's Hospital does. The burns unit now treats 1 000  children  a
year, mostly younger than six years old. The Red Cross  Children's  Hospital
also has the only paediatric neurosurgery facility in South Africa  and  has
done 60 liver transplants over the past 10  years,  as  well  as  100  renal
transplants since it began that intervention in 1968.

The successful separation of the  conjoined  twins  Zinzi  and  Zanele  Kona
attracted  worldwide  attention  and  media  coverage  to  the   Red   Cross
Children's Hospital. It was the 35th time  that  conjoined  twins  had  been
separated by teams at the Red Cross Children's Hospital.

Obviously, the need to address the  inequitable  distribution  of  resources
between provinces has impacted on  the  conditional  grants  that  fund  the
large  academic  teaching  hospitals  and  university  faculties  of  health
science.

This will have a significant impact on the funds  available  for  health  in
the province, with an envisaged decrease of R230 million over the next  five
years beginning during 2002-03. Obviously such a  highly  specialised  level
of service demands and well-resourced operations depend mainly on  financial
resources to counteract the high cost of  medical  consumables  and  support
structures.

A   large   proportion   of   items   used   is   import-based,   especially
pharmaceuticals, equipment and specialised  consumables.  As  the  House  is
aware,  the  national  conditional  grant  for  the  Western  Cape  tertiary
institution was significantly reduced, A projected shortfall of  up  to  R12
million is indicated for this financial year and  everything  possible  will
be done to avoid the painful course of reduced  patient  care  in  terms  of
numbers and specialities.

However, we will not lose sight of our province's key  objectives.  The  key
objectives for the  Western  Cape  department  of  health  are  an  improved
quality of care, the control of HIV/Aids and the allied threat  of  TB,  and
the reshaping of health services.

Our  priorities  also  include  the  control  of   trauma,   the   effective
decentralisation of management and the emergency medical  service,  which  I
have selected as a special ministerial  priority.  After  delays  under  the
previous dispensation, the district health  system  has  been  tackled  with
vigour in the Western Cape.

Because services were provided at so many  different  levels  in  the  past,
they were very fragmented. In the marriage of the local authorities  to  the
provinces, such fragmentation is being eliminated as  the  respective  areas
of jurisdiction take shape around the first objective:  quality,  integrated
and comprehensive primary health care. To this end,  the  marriage  partners
are sorting out borders, legislation, services and functions, and  financial
arrangements are  being  made  for  personnel,  conditions  of  service  and
labour.

We have calculated that 90% of health care in the primary health care  model
is dispensed at the first level by nursing staff.  Add  to  this  the  first
level of hospital care provided by doctors and nurses as well as the  second
level embracing  specialists  and  general  practitioners,  and  the  figure
becomes 98%. The third and fourth levels of care by specialists  and  super-
specialists shared by the Western, Eastern and  Northern  Cape  account  for
the remaining 2%. By focusing on the first level,  we  are  taking  care  of
many problems that would have presented higher up.

I would also like to refer to the results of the 2001 annual  HIV  antenatal
survey, which were released this week. We are all hopeful  that  this  trend
will continue. The plight of young women should feature prominently  in  the
fight against a disease that, as  the  hon  the  Minister  noted,  is  still
claiming too many lives in South and Southern Africa.

In the Western Cape we have noted that the prevalence of HIV  has  increased
in urban areas and decreased slightly in the  rural  areas.  If  this  means
that we have to reprioritise our spending to ensure that we  are  addressing
the problem, then that is what we will do.

The Western Cape department of health also notes  that  different  solutions
have to be found for HIV-positive and  HIV-negative  orphans.  An  important
emerging aspect of HIV and Aids care in the Western Cape is  that  different
public sector players work with NGOs to  provide  step-down  facilities  and
home-based care. Obviously the hospitals and other formal health  structures
will play a leading role in this, but our  best  chance  of  success  is  if
there is close co-operation  between  health,  social  services,  education,
NGOs, local  government,  traditional  healers  and  academic  and  research
bodies.

There have been requests  from  various  private  organisations  to  provide
children's step-down facilities. A process is now in place  to  guide  these
initiatives, as many issues must be considered before the go-ahead is  given
to these  organisations,  for  example  sustainability,  equity  within  the
province and an analysis to identify where there is the keenest need.  Step-
down care is proactive rather than  reactive,  and  that  makes  it  a  more
manageable intervention. It is a holistic health care approach which  allows
the very frail to reduce isolation and spend their  last  days  in  familiar
surroundings, while rendering a service to their families.  It  reduces  the
pressure on hospital beds and other resources and shares the cost of care.

Accountability and a sense of ownership  are  generated  by,  amongst  other
things, avoiding referral to and from higher levels.  A  step-down  facility
is a stepping down from the high level of care  administered  by  hospitals.
As such it may dispense palliative care to patients who are too  ill  to  be
at home, but not ill enough to be in hospital. For some it  is  a  temporary
shelter, a sort of halfway house for two or three weeks before  going  home.
It might provide people with shelter for their loved ones while  the  family
or care-givers take a short break. For others it  will  act  as  a  hospice,
providing terminal care and a place to die with dignity.

As a society we are  moving  steadily  to  a  point  of  no  return  in  the
provision of more community care, home-based care and especially frail  care
for our growing number of HIV and Aids sufferers.

We depend on the commitment of the care-givers, because step-down care  must
be person-centred and sensitive to culture, religion and  value  systems  in
order to respect dignity and privacy. It must ensure  quality  of  care  and
access to other support services. It  must  be  cost-effective,  sustainable
and specific in what needs to  be  done.  It  must  empower  and  allow  for
capacity building to promote the independence  of  the  individual  and  the
family or care-givers.

March 2002 saw the official opening of Southern Cape/Karoo  facility  linked
to George Hospital as well as the Paarl Frail Care Centre, which is part  of
the community project of the NGO Agape.

The Drakenstein municipal authority, which has taken  over  from  the  Paarl
municipality, has fortunately agreed to honour the  very  favourable  rental
arrangement of R10 per month. The province has committed R800 000  per  year
and set the ball rolling. The second centre with 20  beds  was  launched  in
April at St Joseph's and the third in May at the  Frans  Conradie  Hospital,
also  with  20  beds.  The  province's  fourth  facility  planned  for  this
financial year comprises 25 beds at Lentegeur  and  is  on  track  for  next
month.

Boland/Overberg has the Bram Fisher Care Centre, which  is  a  hospice  that
functions as a step-down facility. Negotiations  are  under  way  to  assist
Worcester Hospice, which is already functioning as a  hospice,  and  Grabouw
Training College as a step-down facility. This is in addition to  the  other
children's step-down facilities funded by the  province  in  the  metropole.

Cllr   N   MAYATHULA-KHOZA   (Salga):   Chairperson   ...   [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] Am I protected, Chair?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  You  are
protected, hon member. You may proceed.

Cllr N MAYATHULA-KHOZA (Salga): Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  MECs,  hon
members of the House, ladies  and  gentlemen,  let  me  thank  you  for  the
opportunity of representing Salga in this Health budget debate. Let me  also
commend the hon the  Minister  for  her  comprehensive  budget  speech  this
afternoon.

One of the critical key performance areas  where  local  government  has  to
succeed is the attainment of acceptable health standards in the delivery  of
municipal health services.

There is an  indisputable  link  between  an  effective  health  policy  and
services on the one hand, and the social and  economic  development  of  our
people on the other. Malaria is estimated to have slowed economic growth  in
Africa by up to 1,3% per cent each year and HIV/Aids to have done so  by  up
to 2,6% in high-prevalence countries.

Good health enhances development in many ways. These  include  the  survival
of trained labour, higher productivity  amongst  healthier  workers,  higher
rates  of  savings  and  investment  and  greater  enterprise  and  agrarian
activity, as well  as  increased  direct  foreign  investment  and  tourism.
Children's educational achievements are higher,  which  ultimately  enhances
productivity, lowers rates of fertility, and thereby changes the  dependency
ratio.

It is therefore abundantly clear that the flip side of  this  coin  is  that
ill health exacerbates poverty at the family level. We  must  do  everything
in our power to break the stranglehold of poverty over our people.

We note  that  R483  million  of  the  total  R7,1  billion  of  the  budget
constitutes the budget for the national Health department. The remainder  is
transferred to provinces and other institutions to  support  the  priorities
of the national department. This, in our view,  demonstrates  the  budgetary
commitment of the department to its key roles, which  are,  amongst  others,
to lead and co-ordinate the national health system, to  develop  policy  and
legislation, and to support and monitor implementation. Salga  supports  the
priorities as outlined in the budget and will make brief reference to them.
The area of mental health is an important component  of  the  health  system
and has for long  being  neglected.  Its  prioritisation  will  enhance  the
social development function of local government.

The strengthening of mortuary services in  preparation  for  their  transfer
from the SAPS is also a  critical  priority  area.  Practical  problems  are
experienced on a daily basis by municipal staff  in  respect  of  deaths  in
clinics. This will assist with the streamlining of services to communities.

In the area of HIV and Aids and sexually transmitted  infections  there  are
significant increases through conditional grants and funding  to  provinces.
What Salga would like to  see  is  a  systematic  flow  of  funds  to  local
government,  which  is  at  the  core  of  delivery.  Currently   provincial
allocations in this regard are occurring in very limited  circumstances  and
there is no clear and consistently applied policy which spells out the  role
of local government in this regard.  Local  government  needs  part  of  the
allocations that are currently made to provinces for HIV and Aids to have  a
ring-fenced component intended for  transfer  to  all  municipalities  in  a
province.

The training and development of health  professionals  is  another  critical
priority area for local government. Primary health care  services  that  are
run by municipalities are dependent upon a functioning  referral  system  to
district and other hospitals. Any investment to  increase  the  availability
of specialist medical support at such hospitals, especially  in  the  poorer
provinces, is strongly supported.

Similarly  the  hospital  management  and  quality  improvement   grant   is
supported by Salga as a mechanism to assist  the  institutional  development
and support of hospitals  that  serve  the  municipal  primary  health  care
centres.

We also want to indicate that  although  the  maternal,  child  and  women's
health budget has  been  decreased  this  year  for  valid  reasons,  it  is
welcomed  by  organised  local  government  to  ensure  the  prevention  and
management of various diseases, injuries and  illnesses  in  women  such  as
cervical cancer and breast cancer.

We also welcome the report  that  the  role  of  local  government  and  the
progressive devolution of primary health care services remain  high  on  the
policy agenda, that service agreements  with  local  government  are  to  be
developed and that district planning  and  implementation  of  the  district
information systems are to strengthened. Our request however, is that  views
and suggestions by organised local  government  on  this  matter  should  be
taken into cognisance.

The final issue we would like to raise is that of the National Health  Bill,
which was  published  for  comment  in  November  2001.  As  Salga  we  have
submitted our comments in February and understand that a  revised  draft  is
due for release soon.

The key concerns for Salga are the provisions for the establishment  of  the
district health system and the definition of ``municipal health  services''.
The  definition  of  ``  municipal  health  services''  will  determine  the
financial responsibility of  metropolitan  and  district  municipalities  in
respect of health service delivery.

The current proposed  definition  is  that  municipal  health  services  are
equivalent to environmental health services.  Even  this  narrow  definition
may place  an  unaffordable  burden  on  district  municipalities.  This  is
particularly the case where health services have traditionally  been  cross-
subsidised from other local income such as  property  rates  which  are  not
available to district municipalities.

Furthermore, the equitable share  allocation  that  district  municipalities
receive does not include a  component  for  environmental  health.  In  this
regard Salga  would  put  forward  that  the  equitable  share  formula  for
district municipalities be revised to  include  a  component  for  municipal
health, whichever way it is defined, as part of its basic services.

In conclusion, the effective  implementation  of  health  policies  and  the
sustained delivery of health services are key to  the  social  and  economic
development of our people. It is clear from the  budget  that  the  bulk  of
resources are transferred to provinces in order  to  support  delivery.  The
priorities as set out in the Vote are supported  by  Salga  and  its  member
municipalities. We  therefore  look  forward  to  the  finalisation  of  the
National Health Bill as a means  to  provide  a  better  life  for  all  our
people.

I therefore would like to take the opportunity  once  more  to  express  our
appreciation of Salga's effective participation and contribution  to  Minmec
meetings  that  basically  deal  with  policy  and  legislative  issues  and
strategic health programmes, as well as  health  service  delivery  and  the
Letsema campaign.

Although I joined the Minmec meetings only a few months ago, I am  convinced
of a productive and healthy working relationship between  Salga  and  Minmec
even though Salga is seldom mentioned on issues of  health  services.  Maybe
Minmec  should  be  called  ``Minmec-Salga''   or   something   like   that.
[Laughter.]

The Minister being the driving force  in  the  Minmec  as  well  as  in  the
Ministry itself, Salga would like to  congratulate  her  especially  on  her
department's effective spending  of  funds  on  related  programmes  and  on
health services, although we heard today that some of our provinces are  not
really spending all the budgets that were allocated to them.

We want to commend the Minister on the good work done in spite  of  all  the
difficulties we have faced during this past financial year and  we  need  to
congratulate her on this. [Applause.]

Ms W G THUSI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister of Health  Dr  Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, hon NCOP members, hon  MECs  and  special  delegates,  I
bring warm revolutionary greetings from  the  warm  and  evergreen  KwaZulu-
Natal. [Applause.]

I would like to thank the Chairperson for affording me  the  opportunity  of
participating in this  important  debate.  I  want  to  thank  the  hon  the
Minister for such an informative budget speech.

I would  like  to  focus  my  speech  on  HIV/Aids  and  the  food  security
programme, for the simple reason that studies  show  that  KwaZulu-Natal  is
leading in HIV/Aids infection statistics  and  it  is  one  of  the  poorest
provinces  in  the  country.  The  fight  against   HIV/Aids   and   poverty
alleviation are our province's priorities. In the last  two  years  KwaZulu-
Natal has hit the headlines in the media because of the outbreak of  malaria
and cholera. As long as the majority  of  the  people  are  still  poor  and
living in poor conditions, it is going to  be  difficult  to  eradicate  the
preventable communicable diseases. Poverty  alleviation  and  food  security
are important programmes and must be addressed  aggressively.  We  therefore
welcome the increase in  the  KwaZulu-Natal  allocation,  although  it  will
never be enough.

We  in  KwaZulu-Natal  are  optimistic  that,  with  all  our  efforts,  the
situation in the province will be turned around. Our  approach  is  holistic
and is in line with the national HIV/Aids and STD strategic plan  for  South
Africa in 2000-2005.

We do not believe in just dispensing drugs, but  also  in  dispensing  care,
compassion, comfort and empathy in an  environment  of  tolerance,  openness
and understanding. An HIV/Aids action unit was established in  the  province
in 1999 in order to combat and deal robustly with the impact of HIV/Aids  in
the province in a co-ordinated manner.

The Provincial HIV/Aids  Action  Unit  is  in  the  process  of  setting  up
voluntary counselling and testing centres in all hospitals  and  clinics  in
the province. This follows the successful launch of over 20 VCT  centres  in
nonmedical science last year and early this year. Linked to this,  the  Paau
runs a successful lay counsellors' training course. Counsellors are  central
to  both  the  VCT  and  the  prevention  of  mother-to-child   transmission
programmes.

The training has been taken over by Paau  from  three  organisations,  Atic,
Actsa and TAC in order to  standardise  the  service.  There  are  over  140
counsellors who are contracted to the department. With the  introduction  of
the integrated plan on children  infected  and  affected  by  HIV/Aids,  the
Department of Health, through Paau and the Department of Social  Development
have  jointly  implemented  a  home-based  care  programme   which   ensures
continued care from the hospital to the  home  of  the  person  living  with
HIV/Aids.

Last year, over 800 home-based care kits  were  given  to  home-based  care-
givers who had undergone training on the new  integrated  module.  Paau  has
managed  to  successfully  establish  partnerships   with   all   government
departments,   resulting   in   the    formation    of    a    KwaZulu-Natal
interdepartmental Aids committee, consisting of a representative  from  each
department, which meets every two months. Paau also runs  another  programme
which focuses on the army,  the  police  and  members  of  the  correctional
services, under the umbrella of the SA Civil-Military Alliance. Paau has  to
date trained a total of 1 148 traditional healers on HIV/Aids, STDs, TB  and
other  conditions  like  malaria  and  cholera.  Master  trainers  from  the
traditional healers trained their colleagues. Along with these  155  amagosa
[officials], leaders  in  the  isicathamiya  [traditional  Zulu  music]  and
traditional dance groups are also trained.

Paau has also forged partnerships with the private sector.  An  Aids  orphan
trust fund has been formed, which  is  an  initiative  between  Paau,  local
media and business and international  consulates.  The  trust  is  aimed  at
raising funds for orphans locally, nationally and  internationally  and  was
launched in February 2002.  Paau,  SA  Breweries  and  Taverners  have  also
formed a partnership, which was launched in Port Shepstone  last  year,  and
the programme is to be extended throughout the province.

The taxi industry is also targeted, and Paau has  implemented  a  successful
campaign with the transport sector. A major awareness  campaign  is  ongoing
on two main provincial  radio  stations,  in  the  main  newspapers  and  on
private radio stations to get the  message  through  to  the  population  of
KwaZulu-Natal.  We  do  have  poverty  alleviation  programmes   which   are
currently being implemented in two phases,  namely  community  projects  and
clinic  garden  projects.  There  are  22  community  alleviation   projects
implemented and administered by  four  cluster  managers,  namely  the  Lima
Rural Development Foundation, Mathus Nutrition  and  Development  Advocates,
the Zakhe Training Institute and Operation Hunger.

We would like to tell the hon the Minister of Health that  as  KwaZulu-Natal
we therefore support the budget. [Applause.]

[Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, hon  Minister  of  Health  and  hon  members,
first and foremost, I would like to say thank you.

This is the ideal time for the Government to look at our performance in  all
our provinces, to evaluate whether we have done  well  and  where  we  still
need to make some improvements in our activities. Without doubt I  am  aware
of the fact that our people in South Africa are receiving  better  essential
health services than in the past. This is made possible by our ministers  of
Health in our provinces.

Allow me to congratulate  the  Department  of  Health  for  the  great  work
undertaken by this department. The department is managing  to  do  all  this
through the leadership of our MECs, even those from  other  departments.  We
know that poverty differs from  one  province  to  the  other.  This  causes
development not to take place  at  the  same  time.  There  is  a  committee
responsible for helping with development in our provinces.

According to the research conducted  by  central  Government  together  with
provincial governments, there has been good progress. The  Government  makes
a point that citizens receive help from our  clinics.  Most  hospitals  were
upgraded, where buildings had been renovated and equipment and medical  care
was improved. Hospitals like Pretoria Academic,  Nkosi  Albert  Luthuli  and
Nelson Mandela Complex are up to standard. At Umtata there  is  a  programme
responsible  with  upgrading   of   hospitals   and   is   called   Hospital
Reconstruction and Rehabilitation.

Human Resource Development and Management,  where  doctors  and  nurses  are
working  hard  in  enabling  people  to  have  access  to  public  care   is
commendable and enables people to  be  assisted  in  health  care  in  rural
areas.

The legislative reform goes hand in hand  with  this  Act.  We  are  looking
forward to the tabling of the Health Bill that  is  going  to  help  in  the
strengthening of the private and public sectors in regard to medication.  In
the past, we approved a Bill concerning the mentally handicapped people,  in
terms of which they are treated in order to be able to live  a  normal  life
again. This is done in order to fulfil the South African Constitution.

We are proud of managing to improve the  quality  of  life  of  all  people.
There was a national conference responsible for doing away with poverty  and
South Africa was also represented and has membership.

There is a programme called Nepad, through which poverty in  African  states
is being considered. South Africa is a member  of  Nepad.  South  Africa  is
leading in a  fight  against  poverty  in  all  countries  under  SADC.  For
example, Nepad accepted the peace  agreement  at  Abuja  regarding  diseases
like Malaria and HIV/Aids.

Lastly, I would like to thank the Department of Health for this  great  task
of improving the quality of life of our people.  Our  country  is  different
from other countries. The improvement of our country is not a small task.

Please continue with your good work. The country  is  very  appreciative  of
what you are doing. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I asked to speak for 30 minutes, but  I
only spoke for 23 minutes.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! You  spoke  for
40 minutes, hon Minister.

The MINISTER: No, Chairperson, I was  monitoring  myself.  I  will  be  very
brief, though, in my response.

Firstly, I would like to thank all the hon members for  a  very  lively  and
constructive debate and for supporting the budget before us. I just want  to
say that the debate has given us the opportunity to share  our  experiences,
achievements and challenges in the delivery of health care services  in  our
country.

I would like to comment on only two other issues, without  attributing  them
to any particular hon member. I would like to thank hon members  for  having
participated in the activities of the April Health  Month,  and  I  am  sure
that most will have received the prescription that came free of charge  from
the national Minister of Health. I would encourage hon members to  also  try
to obtain the Health in Action booklet, which assists one to manage  certain
conditions without necessarily going to the health institutions.

With regard to the issue of equity, which I think  is  a  burning  issue,  I
would like to remind the House that I did refer  to  the  national  tertiary
services grant and the manner in which we propose to handle them this  time,
so as to address the problems of inequity.

There is just one more thing before I sit down. It is  about  the  issue  of
HIV/Aids. I think we can say with confidence that, as a nation, we  are  now
responding to the HIV infection together.  There  is  transparency  that  is
growing out there, in terms of talking  about  HIV  and  Aids,  and  we  are
beginning to strengthen the intersectoral approach.

As a department, we have moved very speedily to  develop  the  protocol  for
the administration of AZT and 3TC for the survivors of  sexual  assault.  Of
course there are  challenges  that  we  have  identified  in  terms  of  the
administration of nevirapine, which we will  be  addressing  in  the  coming
year. We also acknowledge that there has been an increase in the budget  for
the national  response,  so  that  we  can  indeed  expand  our  programmes,
particularly the home-based care and community-based care  also  consolidate
and sustain our programmes.

The last thing is about TB, because it would  be  incorrect  of  me  not  to
refer to tuberculosis. As hon members know, there is currently a  conference
in Durban on TB and other lung diseases that is being attended by  over  600
participants from Africa and Europe. It is indeed  a  very  big  conference,
and we think that out of that conference will emanate some of the  solutions
that might assist us in  addressing  the  problem  of  tuberculosis  in  the
country. I must add that I think we are doing well in this context  too.  In
the last year we have been able to increase the TB cure  rate  from  56%  to
62%. What we intend to do this year and next year is to  increase  the  Dots
coverage in the country, because there is much disparity in  terms  of  Dots
coverage, ranging from 24% to 100%, and we want to fill that gap.
Lastly, I would like to thank my colleague Piet Meyer for his kind words.  I
believe he holds the record as the shortest-lived premier in  South  Africa.
[Laughter.] I can assure him that we are happy  to  have  him  back  in  the
health family. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): I wish  to  take  this
opportunity to thank the Minister for having been very brief  in  her  reply
and for engaging this House in a lively debate.

                    PRECEDENCE TO SUBJECTS FOR DISCUSSION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the second item under ``Orders of the Day'' will be  proceeded  with
  thereafter.
I have consulted with the party Whips and  they  have  indicated  that  they
have no objection to the arrangement.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Are you  dealing  with
the second matter for discussion?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I  am  proposing  that  we  deal
with items 1 and 2 under ``Subjects for Discussion'' and thereafter  proceed
with item 2 under ``Orders of the Day''.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

      MEDIA AND PARLIAMENT: A PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE REPRESENTATIVE AND
                           PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson,  for  those  members  who  have
been very diligent and disciplined and  have  been  sitting  in  this  House
while some of us were doing something else, it is with great regret  that  I
must inform them that Bafana Bafana are coming home. We lost  3-2  to  Spain
and Paraguay beat Slovenia 3-1. We lost by one goal. They scored six and  we
scored five. Some of us were having heart attacks while the hon  members  of
the NCOP were quite safe here, sitting in this Chamber. [Laughter.]

I thank you very much, Chairperson, and hon members, for  this  opportunity.
Even those who have traditionally been critical and  even  dismissive  about
African achievements are recognising the  progress  made.  The  momentum  of
change on our continent is beginning to match  or  eclipse  the  vast  steps
forward  a  generation  or  more  ago,  when  Africa  began  to  throw   off
colonialism. It is noteworthy that since 1990 no fewer than  42  of  the  48
countries in sub-Saharan Africa have held multiparty elections.

These developments impact not only on  populations  at  large,  but  on  the
media throughout Africa, for the groundswell of  democracy  brings  with  it
new challenges and opportunities for newspapers and the broadcast media.

In a repressive society, there are few demands on the  media,  and  a  drab,
uncritical uniformity is the order of the day. Sycophantic  journalists  are
honoured and critics, if any, are locked up.

In a democratic environment there is a healthy  tension  between  government
and media, but mutual respect for one another's institutional  independence.
There is, moreover, a flowering of media activity  and  talent  in  such  an
environment, and this puts special pressure on the shoulders  of  those  who
own, edit, market and train in the media industry.

An institution that supremely  requires  media  attention  in  a  democratic
environment is Parliament itself. Indeed, to the extent  that  parliamentary
events are neglected by the media,  democracy  is  impoverished.  Those  who
take the trouble to elect parties and their  representatives  to  Parliament
are entitled to know what these representatives are doing  and  saying,  how
they behave and how they approach the many issues that confront the  nation.
Parliament is not an exclusive social club, but an open forum for the  whole
nation.

With reference to the subject of our debate today, it should  be  said  that
the nature of the relationship between  Parliament  and  the  media  is  not
ideally to be seen as a partnership. Each institution is too jealous of  its
freedom of action and independence for that comfy description. They are  not
in bed together, except on rare and sometimes celebrated occasions  when  an
individual enterprise achieves what institutions avoid.

Parliament and the media are institutions that stand alone,  and  each  must
be given space by the other to get on with their important  work,  which  is
central to democracy.  That  said,  it  must  be  accepted  that  Parliament
without  the  media  presents  as  barren  a  scene  as  the  media  without
Parliament.

We in South Africa must not lose sight of the fact that good  governance  is
central to the success of the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development,
Nepad, on which so much on our  continent  and  country  depends.  Recently,
this inspired plan  for  Africa  received,  as  hon  members  will  know,  a
valuable boost at the Africa summit meetings of the World Economic Forum  in
Durban.

Parliament  in  a  democracy  is  inherently  newsworthy.  The  debate   and
engagement among MPs, even operating under a strict party whip, can lead  to
unexpected  outcomes,  and  the  very  basis  of  news  is  the  unexpected.
Moreover, a democratic parliament is in  touch  with  the  feelings  of  the
populace in general and, to this extent, there is a strong news interest  in
what it gets up  to.  Charting  the  process  of  legislation,  motions  and
questions  in  Parliament,  not  to  mention  the  diverting  activities  of
personalities and parties,  can  be  an  exacting  job,  and  it  is  up  to
Parliament to ensure maximum access and proper facilities to journalists  so
that they can do their job.

I have commented elsewhere on the irony that the  South  African  Parliament
enjoyed more space and time in the media in the days when it  was  merely  a
rubber stamp for the repressive apartheid rulers. Admittedly, much  of  what
was said was so crassly stupid or blatantly racist  that  the  media  had  a
responsibility to preserve it for posterity, so that our  children  can,  in
wide-eyed wonder, now see what went before. But  it  is  an  undoubted  fact
that now that Parliament is a creative, meaningful, and democratic force  in
the land, it should attract more attention from the media. It has  a  myriad
activities, numbers of fully reportable committees and many newsworthy full-
dress occasions to attract journalistic attention. The  President  regularly
addresses Parliament and answers questions, as does the Deputy President.

This brings me specifically to the NCOP. This is a meaningful House, not  in
the mould of second or upper houses in South African history  or  elsewhere,
which have been repositories of incompetence, party loyalty  or  mediocrity.
It has direct links with the provinces, which lie at the  very  coalface  of
administration and delivery in South Africa. It is a  place  where  premiers
tread.
But  it  does  seem  obvious  that  the  National  Assembly  enjoys  greater
attention in the media than this House. It would be a good idea if the  NCOP
looked closely at the situation and devised strategies to raise its  profile
via the media. This is not to downplay past efforts, which have led to  some
considerable success, but it is an ongoing and uphill  battle,  particularly
when one  considers  that  this  House  is  so  strongly  representative  of
provincial  interests,   whereas   the   media   generally,   as   currently
constituted, are concentrated in the cities.

So I should like to issue a challenge to both  this  House  and  the  media.
Both should see what they can do creatively and  effectively  to  raise  the
profile of this place in the very real interests of the nation.

The media can be asked to provide a coherent and systematic account of  what
goes on in Parliament, though it remains free to  choose  its  subjects  for
reporting and comment. At the same time, it is  up  to  the  legislature  to
ensure that its own activities are newsworthy and properly communicated.  If
the legislature feels that it is not getting the attention it  deserves,  it
is better to see this as a spur to greater effort,  rather  than  cause  for
complaint.

Generally, media do have special  responsibilities.  A  crucial  one  is  to
maintain the highest standards of reporting and  comment.  Editors  are  the
upholders of these norms, and when journalists depart from them, it  is  the
editors who must curb their excesses  and  make  amends  in  public  through
adequate  and  spontaneous  correction  and,  where  warranted,  apology   -
something which, incidentally, legislators should also do when we err. As  I
have argued before, in order to edit, editors should, surely, have  intimate
knowledge of their journalists' sources and  exercise  some  judgment  about
their veracity. Do they all?

Editors  should,  moreover,  raise  the  status   of   their   parliamentary
journalists if they want to give a coherent account of  law-making,  and  if
they wish  to  have  a  meaningful  relationship  with  the  institution  of
Parliament. I have  gained  the  impression  that  this  is  an  area  which
requires substantial and urgent attention at editor level. If  they  do  not
give their parliamentary reporters the attention they deserve,  other  areas
of  reporting,  for  example  financial,   environmental   and   information
technology, will eclipse parliamentary reporting, to the nation's loss.

In South  Africa  we  are  about  to  embark  on  a  system  of  accrediting
journalists to cover the Presidency. It would be a pity if  this  move  were
seen as competition for parliamentary reporters, and  not  as  complementary
to what they do. Without  in  any  sense  downplaying  the  significance  of
reporting the executive, it is necessary  for  the  media  to  maintain  the
balance between the legislature and the executive, and it would be  an  idea
if reporters sought to cover both, as far as possible.

So I would like to make an appeal to the media to  extend,  not  to  reduce,
their  coverage  of  Parliament.  They   should   consider   more   detailed
information on parliamentary  programmes  and  greater  depth  in  analysis,
which involve careful  study  of  basic  documents  and  more  attention  to
speeches, which are currently almost totally ignored in  large  sections  of
the media. This, of itself, would ensure that speech  quality  improves.  To
know that one's utterances are likely to be reported is  a  discipline  that
can  exercise  the  mind  wonderfully,  and  be  a  spur  to  newsiness  and
creativity.

To close, I would suggest that never before in  South  African  history  has
Parliament  had  closer  links  with  the  people.  Surely  this  should  be
reflected in the media, a worker, if not actually a  partner,  in  the  same
democratic cause. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, listening to the hon Dr  Pahad,  I  realise
that this debate  is  long  overdue,  but  it  is  also  apparent  that  not
everything is 100% in balance, and we must realise that it is not  a  simple
issue.

But, just as Parliament is one of the main pillars of democracy, so  is  the
free and independent media  one  of  the  other  important  institutions  of
democracy. In a sense, we as parliamentarians and the members of  the  media
are partners and, in more ways than one, two sides  of  the  same  coin.  We
both have a complementary role to play in the enhancement of the  democratic
process to better inform the electorate.

In order to raise the esteem  of  our  Parliament  and,  particularly,  this
House, as the hon Pahad mentioned as well, we should be able  to  work  with
the important fourth pillar,  the  media,  to  promote  the  values  of  our
growing democracy. In order for Parliament and the media  to  perform  their
respective duties to that end, both groups must  work  together,  despite  a
degree of healthy mutual suspicion that will always be an essential part  of
such a relationship. But  we  should  still  respect  the  media  and  avoid
adversarial relations.

It also places on the media in Parliament  a  huge  responsibility,  amongst
others, to report in a responsible and informed fashion at  all  levels,  of
the proceedings of the institution. In order to do so, every journalist  has
to keep abreast of happenings and developments and, brush up on her  or  his
knowledge comprehensively on the position and role of  Parliament  and  MPs,
as well as every relevant subject.

All should work through an  information  overload  to  analyse  reports  and
documents in more detail, so that they are able to  inform  the  readers  or
viewers or listeners fairly and factually about the things  that  they  need
to know.

A few gremlins have been spotted in recent reporting. Opinion creeps into  a
lot  of  reports  and  is  disguised  as  fact  or   so-called   ``objective
contextualisation''. Others focus more on trivialities and  the  fabrication
of scandal, tensions or controversy, or even the elevation  and  overplaying
of honest disagreements over policy in parties.

Furthermore,  some  modern-day  reporters  tend  to  rely  solely  on   news
releases, the so-called ``cut-and-paste reporters''.  Some  even  plagiarise
releases and present them as the product of their own research.  This  could
be the result of the glaring juniorisation  that  is  taking  place  in  the
parliamentary media. Even students are spotted assisting from time to  time.
The numbers of the members of the media have dwindled, leaving those  behind
to work at an even heavier pace  to  keep  up  to  time  and  those  dreaded
deadlines.

Parliament is the people's forum and thus deserves coverage at  the  highest
standards befitting it as  the  duly  elected  voice  of  the   people,  and
attention should be paid to the  views  expressed  by  all  MPs.  Parliament
should also consider its own measures of support to  make  it  possible  for
media houses to keep their best reporters in Parliament. Added to  this,  it
should be suggested that an own news service be established  also  to  serve
those well-loved regional and local  publications  or  radio  stations  with
topical news and updates on the work done by their representatives here.

Both MPs and members of the media have a role to  play  in  determining  the
way forward. It would be wise to get round-table  talks  under  way  in  our
Parliament to speed up the process of building  an  effective  relationship.
More  imaginative  and  attractive  ways  must  be  developed   to   enhance
parliamentary coverage  so  that  people  are  encouraged  to  take  greater
interest or participate  in  their  society's  principal  democratic  forum.
Therefore, vital issues of the day should  be  discussed  more  promptly  in
Parliament.

We as MPs should accept that  our  Chambers  are  modern-day  TV  studios  -
reality TV at its best with live shows. As the directors and actors  of  our
own show, we should make it more interesting and  relevant.  We  must  raise
the standard of debate and discourage that which will, inevitably,  lead  to
adverse coverage.

Maybe we should ask if we would have watched the soapie that has  just  been
played out in this House in the debate before this  one,  whether  that  was
interesting enough to keep the attention  of  the  viewer.  We  should  urge
Ministers and members  to  deliver  important  statements  and  reports  in,
rather than outside, Parliament.
The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, together  with  the  World  Bank
Institute, has done tremendous work at this level. In February 2002  in  New
Delhi, representatives of MPs and  journalists  identified,  for  the  first
time, ways to improve the relationship between  parliament  and  the  media,
all in order to promote representative and participatory democracy.

International concern is growing that in  almost  every  country  the  trend
towards governments making statements outside parliament draws  the  media's
attention away from parliament and tends to detract from the  role  and  the
importance of business conducted in the House.

Our House has had to be contented with that wooden spoon for far  too  long.
In turn, this means the media is informing the  electorate  inadequately  of
the work of its representatives.

To avoid this  abyss,  media  representatives  suggested  in  2002  possible
guidelines of action to make Parliament the main game  in  the  politics  of
the country. It  was  followed  up  by  the  April  2002  Indian  Ocean  Rim
conference on securing an effective relationship, which led to the  adoption
of the Cape Town principles of  an  informed  democracy  by  MPs  and  media
professionals. Both these important papers should be a guide for our own  or
similar discussions. We should  also  investigate  the  possibility  of,  in
future,  including  representatives  of  our  own  to   such   international
conferences.

It is also understood that the new presidential press  corps  to  which  the
hon Pahad referred could redirect the attention of political reporting  away
from Parliament and eventually create a new elite of journalists  that  will
compete for space and time, just to push  reporting  from  this  institution
into a less prominent position. This brings to mind the inevitable: that  an
overhaul of the landscape of the political reporter is at hand.

Reform is also needed here in our Parliament. The media in Parliament  needs
to transform itself into a more inclusive body that also  caters  for  other
role-players and media practitioners in  order  to  make  itself  ever  more
relevant. Here I am thinking of political reporters and correspondents as  a
whole, including those reporting on government at all levels and working  on
provincial legislatures or local councils. It would be wise to include  such
groups as the Media Liaison Officers Forum,  political  party  practitioners
and the presidential corps in a national forum for political media  workers.


In conclusion, although self-regulation is preferred, the media also  has  a
duty to ensure that calls for or  threats  of  legislation  to  control  the
media are avoided by constantly maintaining high standards in  its  coverage
of Parliament, politics and society. Both groups have no choice but  to  co-
operate voluntarily. Let us start soon. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  if  one  walked
through Parliament today, one would notice that there  is  a  whole  section
filled  with  the  offices  of   media   representatives   and   journalists
representing different newspapers from all sectors. They cover  the  day-to-
day activities and decisions made  by  Parliament,  expressing  their  free,
independent opinions. This reflects a true democracy. It is a reflection  of
a complementary relationship between Parliament and the media.

Allow me to raise a concern that has been  preoccupying  my  mind  for  some
time. Somehow the press, for whatever reason, tends to  cover  what  happens
in the National Assembly and, for some  reason,  neglects  or  bypasses  the
proceedings in our own Chamber - that is, the NCOP  -  to  the  extent  that
Parliament is taken to be the National Assembly only, whereas it is the  two
Houses.

Many people seem to wonder about the actual role of the  NCOP  because  half
of the issues we deal with are hardly covered by the media. Let  me  put  it
bluntly and say that it is  an  oversight,  because  the  NCOP  is  part  of
Parliament. Most importantly, it is the direct voice of the  provinces.  Our
constitutional obligation  is  to  link  the  national  Government  and  the
provinces.
To quote one speaker:


  Parliament and the media  are  the  two  most  vital  institutions  in  a
  democracy. Both owe their  origins  to  democratic  thinking.  Parliament
  represents the will of the  people  and  the  media  is  a  link  between
  parliament and the people. Both develop  their  own  procedures  and  are
  masters  of  their  own.  However,  it  is  important  that  a   balanced
  relationship is developed between these vital institutions.

The debate today is about just that. It is about  stressing  the  importance
of good relations between the media and Parliament  and  strengthening  that
relationship for us to have a vibrant democracy -  a  relationship  that  is
bonded and yet independent, but dedicated to  the  interests  of  all  South
Africans. It is that relationship  that  is  committed  to  nation-building,
improvement of the quality of life of our people and a vibrant,  competitive
economy, a relationship that promotes  Afro-optimism,  which  reflects  that
ours is an Africa of hope. We are  talking  about  what  our  hon  President
often refers to as the new patriotism and at times as a workable dream.

It  is  indeed  a  challenging  initiative  to  develop  a  society  without
Parliament and the media complementing one another. To quote one speaker:


  A free, responsible and diverse  media  is  as  vital  to  parliament  as
  democracy is to the maintenance of the freedom of the press.

As we all know, we come  from  a  past  where  neither  the  media  nor  the
government represented the needs of all the  people  of  South  Africa.  But
today we are speaking a different language, a language of  unity,  of  hope,
of optimism, of good relations between these two sectors that  play  a  very
important role in the lives of our people.

This relationship is crucial, if we intend having a workable  democracy  and
indeed making sure that our vision  of  African  success  does  take  place.
Nevertheless, it does not come without challenges, for we are a nation  with
a past, a nation whose long road of struggle has just ended and yet  at  the
same time has just begun.

The relationship between  Parliament  and  media  has  always  been  a  very
controversial issue, not only here, but also in several  other  democracies.
Even President Roosevelt himself felt that the press hated him. As  much  as
the press should be a major critic of government,  that  criticism  must  be
enriching, positive and constructive. It must contribute to  the  prosperity
and maturity of our democracy.

The media contributes vitally to the people,  making  them  understand  what
happens in Parliament, informing them about the  policies,  the  initiatives
and so forth. It also informs  the  Government  about  the  people's  views,
helping it understand the concerns of the  people  and  their  responses  to
some of the Government's initiatives. In that sense, it is  deeply  involved
in the political life of the nation.

Hence, as we speak, the people are being  updated  every  day  on  the  news
about the latest developments,  for  example,  with  regard  to  the  public
hearings we are having on the Mineral and  Petroleum  Resources  Development
Bill.

To conclude, the media together with Parliament must  work  for  change  and
for a better life. To the media let me say: Please, cover  the  business  of
the second House of Parliament - that is, the NCOP. By so  doing  the  media
will be teaching the nation that Parliament consists of two  Houses.  I  can
assure the hon the Minister that we  definitely  would  like  to  raise  our
profile. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, Minister, one can honestly say that one  of  the
greatest assets this country has is  the  free,  and  lively  and  developed
media we have and its long tradition of independence and courage.  It  is  a
great asset which we must, of course, preserve at all costs. The  debate  on
the interrelationship between Parliament, the executive and the  media,  and
so on, is, of course, a never-ending one and will always go on, but it is  a
dynamic situation which remains dynamic.

I have read some of the Minister's speeches, including the  speech  he  made
at the Indian Ocean Rim conference, and I have to  say  I  could  not  agree
more.

I have to say also, listening to the Minister today, that his attitude is  a
fine one, one that respects that independence,  and  I  have  no  difficulty
with it. In fact, I am  proud  to  be  in  a  parliament  where  the  senior
Minister with particular responsibility for the media - one doubts that  any
Minister could be said to be in charge of the media - has taken the  largely
objective, though not uncritical, view that the Minister has taken. None  of
us likes it when the press are against us. Then we think the press are  bad,
but when the press are for us, we think they are very good. That is  in  the
tradition of parliaments. That has been my experience.

I have difficulty, however, with the word ``partnership''  to  describe  the
relationship between  the  media  and  Parliament.  Possibly  there  can  be
partnership between the media  and  Parliament,  but  certainly  there  must
never be a  partnership  between  the  executive  and  the  media,  and  the
executive in Parliament must not be in partnership with the media. Dr  Pahad
himself said on 15 April, speaking at the Indian  Ocean  Rim  conference  on
Parliament and the media:


  The relationship should, however, not be over close. They should stand at
  arm's length ...

I could not agree with the Minister more.

It is very easy for the siren song of the powerbrokers to pull the media  in
on the inside track and to silence them by virtue of the fact that they  are
insiders. It is better for the media to remain an outsider.

The press mirrors what goes  on  in  Parliament  and  in  our  society.  The
problem, of course, is that when we look that mirror we often  do  not  like
what we see or hear, and often, then, we wish to kill  the  messenger.  That
is nothing new about us. It is something that is universal.

The Minister mentioned the influence of Nepad on the press,  the  media  and
parliamentary relations. We know that as  far  as  media  relationships  and
interrelationship are concerned, our Parliament and  our  media  should  and
will become active in other African cultures. We know that we  have  a  role
to play there. One asks the question: Has much attention been given  to  the
role of the media in the new Pan-African Parliament? What  arrangements  are
going to be made for that media - to host and organise  that  media  and  to
allow it to function?

Where the media come under attack in Africa, we as  a  free  Parliament,  no
matter what the executive may be  doing,  should,  in  fact  be  seeking  to
preserve their liberty. Liberty and freedom of speech, which includes  media
freedom, are indivisible. One either protects it everywhere or  protects  it
nowhere.

I ask myself seriously: What have we in this Parliament done - whatever  the
Government might have done and for whatever good reason, on which  we  might
or might not agree - specifically to protect press freedom, for example,  in
Zimbabwe, which is just across the river, which is  our  closest  neighbour?
What have we done about the harassment of our  own  correspondents  in  that
country? Very little. We hardly raised  a  voice  on  that.  Are  we  really
serious about press freedom in Africa? In the  past  two  years  the  Mugabe
government has stolen US $18 billion, or Zim $1  trillion.  [Time  expired.]
[Interjections.]

Mr L G  LEVER:  Chairperson,  the  subject  for  discussion  is:  Media  and
Parliament,  a  partnership  to  promote  representative  and  participatory
democracy. In the democratic South  African  state,  governed  by  the  1996
Constitution, Parliament has obligations to ensure participatory  democracy,
which is enshrined in sections 59 and 72 of the Constitution.

Section 59 provides that:
  (1) The National Assembly must -


       (a)  facilitate public  involvement  in  the  legislative  and  other
           processes of the Assembly and its committees; and


       (b)  conduct its business in an open manner, and hold  its  sittings,
           and those of its committees, in public, but reasonable  measures
           may be taken -


           (i)   to regulate public access, including access of the  media,
                  to the Assembly and its committees; and


           (ii)  to provide for the searching  of  any  person  and,  where
                  appropriate, the refusal of entry to, or the  removal  of,
                  any person.


  (2) The National Assembly may  not  exclude  the  public,  including  the
       media, from a sitting of a committee  unless  it  is  reasonable  and
       justifiable to do so in an open and democratic society.
Section 72 makes the same provisions applicable to the National  Council  of
Provinces. Section 1(d) of the Constitution provides for:


  Universal  adult  suffrage,  a  national  common  voters  roll,   regular
  elections and a multi-party system of democratic  government,  to  ensure
  responsiveness and openness.

These are the obligations that the Constitution places  on  both  Houses  of
Parliament to ensure a representative and participatory democracy.

The rights of the media are set out, with the rights of  every  resident  of
our country, in section 16(1)(a) and (b), which state that:


  16.(1)   Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which  includes
           -


           (a)   freedom of the press and other media;
           (b)   freedom to receive or impart information or ideas ...

While these rights imply that the media has an obligation  to  exercise  its
freedom to receive or impart information or ideas, its  obligations  go  far
deeper than that. The public expects the media to be  a  guardian  of  their
rights to receive and impart information. The public expects  the  media  to
watch the politicians that  make  up  the  executive,  the  legislatures  in
Parliament and the other spheres of government, and to report to the  public
both on their legislative activities and their implementation of policy,  as
well as delivery of services.

In this sense, the partnership that ought to exist  between  Parliament  and
the media is not a comfortable and friendly relationship, nor should  it  be
comfortable and friendly. If the media is to have any credibility  with  the
public which it serves, it must maintain an independent and critical  arm's-
length relationship with the executive and the legislatures.

It  is  natural  that  there  should  be  an  inherent   tension   in   this
relationship,  which  is  healthy   for   participative,   accountable   and
transparent democracy.  This  tension  between  politicians  and  the  media
arises from the  fact  that  the  media  does  not  owe  allegiance  to  any
politician, no matter what his or her ideology or political  persuasion  is,
but owes its allegiance to the general public.

Another dynamic of this relationship is that politicians  cannot  afford  to
ignore or disregard the media, because they need the  media  to  communicate
their respective ideas and  ideologies  to  the  public.  The  media  cannot
ignore or disregard the body politic in the  country,  firstly,  because  of
its obligation to the public, and,  secondly,  because  to  some  extent  at
least, it is reliant on politicians to provide it with the information  that
it needs.

Has South Africa achieved the right balance in  this  mix?  In  my  opinion,
probably not. The Indian Ocean Rim conference on Parliament and  the  media,
held here in April, is telling in this regard. The  process  in  respect  of
this conference was controlled by the Speaker and the  Chairpersons  of  the
respective Houses of Parliament, as well as the  executive,  it  seems.  The
conference was ostensibly about the relationship between Parliament and  the
media. However, despite being the subject of  the  conference,  neither  the
members of our  Parliament  nor  the  members  of  the  parliamentary  press
gallery were officially invited.

The final and crowning embarrassment was that a  member  of  the  executive,
who, although a member of the National Assembly by virtue of  our  political
dispensation but who, in essence, represents an entirely  different  arm  of
government,  addressed  a  parliamentary  conference  on  the   relationship
between Parliament and the media without any formal participation by  either
the  members  of  Parliament  or  the  parliamentary  press  gallery  -  the
respective  representative  bodies  most  intimately  acquainted  with   the
relationship between Parliament and the media. This, quite  simply,  beggars
belief.

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I think that my Whip has made a mistake  because
I was not informed by him that I should participate.

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members,  Parliament  and  the
media are very important institutions in any democracy. The  media,  on  the
one hand, informs people, influences how they think and  expresses  its  own
liberal, free thoughts. Conceptualisation of political  issues,  events  and
personalities depend on what is portrayed by the  media,  meaning  that  the
media can have a lot of influence on people and  how  they  think  and  make
decisions.

Parliament, on the other hand, represents the interests of  the  people,  it
is voted for by the people, engages with the people and  passes  legislation
that is in the interests of the people. This is why it is critical  that  we
communicate our activities and duties properly. It  is  therefore  incumbent
upon us to revisit our  relationship  with  the  media  in  order  for  both
Parliament and the media to preserve the integrity of Parliament.
We would like think that we have, over the past  eight  years,  demonstrated
our  commitment  to  transparency  and  to  making  information   available.
Therefore a harmonious relationship between these two important  spheres  is
very crucial.

To quote one of the speakers: ``An aspiring and ambitious democratic  policy
needs them both in equal  measure  and  if  that  is  so,  the  relationship
between  them  cannot  be  that  of  allies   or   adversaries,   but   only
complementary to each other.'' For their relationship to be effective,  they
must have knowledge, understanding and appreciation of  each  other's  role,
duties  and  functions,  as  well  as  of  their  own  area  of   work   and
responsibility. They have to lead the path of  morality  and  values,  which
would be an inspiration for the rest of the community.

This is very important especially in the time in which we live,  a  time  in
which one actually wonders what is happening  to  the  moral  fibre  of  our
society. Therefore, today's debate is about how  the  media  and  Parliament
can work together in a productive way for us as a  nation  to  have  a  true
democracy, be a progressive nation and an African success.
It is not a secret that we come from a very hostile past, but today  is  not
about that, but at looking at workable solutions that are favourable to  our
democracy. As a new democracy, we have encountered a lot of challenges  with
regard to transformation, in particular with regard to the media. But  today
we say that the past must remain in the past. We can only learn from it  and
use it as a reminder of what we should never repeat as a nation.

The immediate objective should be to open the door to  a  relationship  that
is mutually constructive between Parliament and the media. Central  to  this
should be a common objective that is dedicated to  nation-building  and  the
bettering of the standards of living of our people, the  major  focus  being
on unifying the nation, discouraging Afro-pessimism and working together  so
that we can indeed make this country ours.

The relationship between Parliament and the media has always been a  subject
of intense debate. To quote Ben Bradlee of the Washington Post:


  Show me a government that is satisfied with the press, and  I  will  show
  you an autocracy. Show me a press that is satisfied with the  government,
  and I will show a lifeless and ill-informed people.

In a democracy it is the free choice of the media to report and  comment  as
they wish. A free media is a product and a symbol of a true democracy.

A World Bank study showed that those countries with  democratic  governance,
a free press and an impartial judiciary achieve higher levels of growth  and
development than others. Therefore, it is this free media  that  we  support
as Parliament and, together with the media,  let  us  make  our  country  an
African success.

As the Minister and other colleagues have already mentioned, a weakness  the
media, both electronic and print, has consistently  been  displayed  in  its
reporting on the activities of  this  important  House  of  Parliament,  the
National Council of Provinces,  especially  in  its  debates,  speeches  and
affairs.

For example, when the Select Committee on Labour and Public Enterprises  was
briefed  this  morning  by  the  Department  of  Communications  on  a  very
important  piece  of  legislation,   the   Electronic   Communications   and
Transactions Bill, no media were present. Their focus is almost  exclusively
on what is happening in  the  National  Assembly.  We  believe  this  to  be
invidious and would remind them that Parliament, after  all,  comprises  two
Houses, each one having its own identity and aura.

Moreover, we would like to assure the media  that  our  efforts  to  suggest
improvement should not be construed as interference and a  threat  to  media
freedom. We are forever mindful of our duty to ensure that our  conduct  and
activities reflect the ethos of this institution.

Allow me to conclude with the words of Cicero, who said: ``For real  respect
is earned by  improving  one's  reputation  by  one's  own  merits,  not  by
climbing upon the distresses and disasters of someone else.'' [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, may I take this opportunity  to
welcome and express my deepest thanks to all the people  who  spoke  in  the
debate today, particularly for all of  the  constructive  points  that  were
made by the speakers. I would just really like to  say  that  I  think  this
debate on how to improve relations between the NCOP now,  specifically,  and
the media must carry on.

Let me make a suggestion, although this may have been done already as I  sit
in the other House and do not know what goes  on  here.  Hon  members  might
want to consider having an open session between themselves as the  NCOP  and
the representatives of the media, including  the  parliamentary  journalists
over here. The aim of this session would not be to  represent  a  particular
party's point of view, but for members of  the  NCOP  to  discuss  with  the
media how the NCOP can be better reported in the media. We can complain,  of
course, but if nobody listens to one's complaint it  will  still  stay  with
one here.

Therefore, I propose that hon members consider doing something positive,  if
they have not done it already, and to have interaction  with  the  media.  I
know that members sit on all these committees, but I cannot see  that  there
should be anything  in  the  parliamentary  Rules  that  would  prevent  hon
members from having such an interaction. I really think that that would  be,
perhaps, a useful starting point from the point of view of the NCOP  getting
and the media giving a greater amount of reporting on what goes  on  in  the
NCOP.

So, once  more,  let  me  thank  the  members  of  this  House  for  a  very
constructive response to what I said and for the all kind  words  that  were
said. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        SUSTAINABLE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, as you know, a few days ago  we
lost a member of Parliament, the hon Peter Mokaba, who had been a leader  of
the youth movement in South Africa and who died while still  very  young.  I
want to take this opportunity, while addressing the NCOP  on  the  issue  of
youth development, to express to the family of Peter Mokaba my  own  and,  I
am sure, the Council's very deep sympathies.

The word ``sustainable'' seems to enjoy more Internet hits than most  others
in the English language. Its use has become a habit in any discussion  about
the way forward in human endeavour, and for good reason. It  is  a  mark  of
the degradation and  danger  that  have  befallen  our  planet  that  it  is
necessary to prefix any serious discussion with  the  word  ``sustainable''.
This is because the planet is in danger, and any plans that we make need  to
be sustainable. This means simply that things should be made to last.

In South Africa, our youth  endured  the  brunt  of  the  onslaught  of  the
apartheid state and,  in  fact,  missed  out  on  much  of  their  youth  in
consequence. This Sunday, 16 June, we as a nation will  bow  our  heads  and
commemorate the thousands who were cut  down  by  police  bullets,  wounded,
jailed, tortured, harassed, whipped, teargassed and driven into  exile.  The
struggle was a necessary and glorious interruption  in  their  daily  lives,
and we witnessed then how,  on  both  sides  of  the  racial  and  political
divide, young people were locked into  violent  conflict  instead  of  being
able to live ordinary lives in peaceful conditions.

The peace has now been won, the abnormal made normal,  and  we  sit  jointly
here in Parliament, former friend and foe, as we approach  the  end  of  the
first decade of our democracy with a sense of  optimism,  and  living  in  a
stable and progressing South Africa.

Particularly because of our country's awful past and the  way  it  adversely
affected the youth, we owe young people now, the  postapartheid  generation,
a chance to live out their lives to adulthood in a spirit  of  optimism  and
fulfilment. The Government must  play  its  full  role  in  achieving  this,
though this should be in active partnership with the private and NGO  sector
and civil society generally.

The youth themselves have heavy responsibilities. Their  conduct  and  their
bearing in public will influence in great measure  how  adult  South  Africa
responds to their needs. They have to earn their place  in  the  future,  as
much as the Soweto generation  did  with  such  brilliance  and  discipline,
though employing different means.

I should like to make an earnest appeal to youth  organisations  across  the
board to take this point to heart, and to seek always to act  with  courtesy
and respect for the law and peace  and  order  in  whatever  campaigns  they
choose to pursue. The armed struggle days have gone. The new  struggle,  for
development and jobs, is on in earnest.

With these thoughts, I commend to this honourable House, as  appropriate  to
this debate, a document which  will  speed  our  nation  towards  integrated
national youth development initiatives and programmes. It  is  the  National
Youth Development Policy Framework 2002-2007. I hope that those hon  members
who have not had an opportunity to study this document yet will do so  after
the debate and that those among the youth who have not read it yet  will  do
the same. The framework was approved by the Cabinet late last year  and  has
been made available by the National Youth Commission. It is an easy read  at
20 pages and warrants careful study by members of this honourable House.

As I state in the foreword, one measure of a progressive state  is  the  way
it treats its youth. Our democracy is in the forefront of  enlightenment  in
the world, for instance in upholding  human  and  socioeconomic  rights,  in
ensuring  gender  equity  almost  unequalled  in  the  world,  in   resolute
affirmative action and  in  adopting  generous  and  tolerant  attitudes  on
important social and moral issues. We must ensure that the way we treat  the
youth is in line with the levels of enlightenment we have achieved in  other
respects. The Government must take a  lead.  Its  departments  have,  for  a
number of years, interacted with the National  Youth  Commission  to  ensure
that youth issues remain central to their activities.

The framework provides an overall view  of  the  national  objectives  being
sought on the youth front. It sets out in  some  detail  a  whole  range  of
matters, for example the  historical  context,  the  definition  of  ``young
person'' and the rights and responsibilities of youth. It describes in  some
detail the framework for the advancement  of  youth  development  generally,
touching   on   subjects   including   nondiscrimination,   the   need   for
sustainability in both rural and urban settings, participation  in  the  new
struggle  ahead,  transparency,  young  women,  youth   with   disabilities,
unemployment and youth at risk. It  also  outlines  strategic  interventions
and policy guidelines. The latter concern education and  training,  economic
participation and empowerment,  justice  and  safety,  social  mobilisation,
capacity-building  and  advocacy.  There  are  separate  sections   on   the
institutional    environment:    government,    legislatures,    independent
institutions and civil society. It is  a  holistic,  compelling  account  of
what needs to be done.

A  critical  factor,  as  spelled  out  under  ``sustainability''   in   the
framework, is to ensure that ``the needs of  the  present  are  met  without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs''.

In these matters, the Government must not only  take  a  lead;  it  must  be
tested. The objectives set out in the framework and other documents must  be
met and be seen to be met. The public at large must assess  critically  what
has  been  achieved  and  what  remains  to  be  done.  Public  and  private
institutions, notably NGOs, should make their voices known  on  whether,  in
their view, we are achieving what we  set  out  to  do.  Frameworks  without
action are empty.

This Parliament, and specifically this House, has a critical  role  to  play
in monitoring  -  through  committees,  plenaries  and  individual  members'
effort - whether we are reaching our targets and realising  our  benchmarks.
So I invite you all to make your input and to  be  frank  and  critical,  if
that is your wish. I would also invite  hon  members,  on  their  provincial
visits, to take this youth document with them and see  to  what  extent  the
provincial  governments  themselves  are  remaining  consistent   with   the
national youth policy.

I would like also to use this opportunity to salute our youth in this  Youth
Development Month. It  is  a  special  month,  a  chance  to  rally  to  the
presidential call, in the spirit of volunteerism or Vukuzenzele, to  lend  a
hand. This call was central to the  state  of  the  nation  speech  that  we
listened to with such appreciation and conviction.

As the National Youth Commission co-ordinates a programme of  activity  that
will see young people  involved  in  partnerships  with  Government  in  the
eradication of poverty through volunteerism in the cause  of  reconstruction
and development; as the youth rally in  the  spirit  of  1976  to  the  call
``Letsema:  youth  service  for  sustainable  development'';  as  the  youth
prepare for voluntary work in schools, hospitals, courts and prisons and  in
the fight against HIV and Aids, and help to register children  eligible  for
the child support grant; and as Government departments set up centres  where
young people can offer themselves for  voluntary  work  -  as  these  things
happen, we march on with a purpose.

The coming two  months  offer  splendid  opportunities  and  challenges  for
youth. Next month's inauguration of the  African  Union  and  the  gathering
momentum for the G8  discussions  in  Canada  on  the  New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development later this month will involve youth events including  a
SADC Youth Parliament  and  seminars.  Youth  will,  moreover,  be  actively
mobilised towards the World Summit on Sustainable Development at the end  of
August in Johannesburg.

Africa's time has come. Youth's time has come. [Applause.]

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, hon Minister in the Presidency, hon  members  and
hon special delegates, although Bafana Bafana have  lost  3-2,  I  think  we
would all agree that they played with character and determination until  the
end. We must salute them for their splendid performance today and hope  that
in the near future, in 2006, we will bring  the  World  Cup  to  Africa.  In
fact, there is still a chance of the World Cup being brought to Africa  this
year. Senegal is still  there,  performing  very  well,  and  we  hope  that
Africa's time has arrived.

In 1980, Comrade O R Tambo, the late president of the ANC, called  upon  the
youth of our country to make the  country  ungovernable  and  the  apartheid
state unworkable. That generation of young people responded to  his  clarion
call  positively.  Indeed,  the  country  was  made  ungovernable  and   the
apartheid state rendered unworkable.  In  each  and  every  community  young
lions were roaring, demanding an end to apartheid and proclaiming  the  need
for freedom for all.

At the helm of the  massive  youth  resistance  struggle  was  the  sterling
leadership  of  a  young  cadre,  a  selfless  revolutionary,  a  loyal  and
dedicated young lion, a true volunteer, a patriot. Here  I  am  speaking  of
Comrade Peter Mokaba.

Death has robbed us  of  a  lion  of  the  north.  We  therefore  lower  our
revolutionary banner to bid farewell to the one we loved and  respected.  We
will most definitely pick up the fallen spear and continue with  the  battle
ahead, because we are supposed  to  do  so  as  the  young  people  of  this
country. We must look at the example set  by  our  former  cadres  and  move
forward with the struggle for the improvement of the  living  conditions  of
our people.

This month of June has been declared Youth Development Month.  Young  people
have  responded  to  this  clarion  call  with  enthusiasm.  June  was   not
identified as a youth month just for its own sake,  but  in  recognition  of
the fact that this month symbolises youth activism in the  struggle  against
apartheid. We should remember that in 1952 we had the  volunteers  of  Chief
Albert Luthuli, who were, in the main, young people. These  were  the  youth
who went from door to door, from community to community, in  preparation  of
the People's Congress, which adopted the Freedom Charter on  26  June  1955.
It is therefore no mere coincidence  that  this  month  was  declared  Youth
Development Month.

We will also remember that 16 June 1976 represents an historic  moment  when
young people were at  the  forefront  of  our  resistance  struggle  against
apartheid  education  and,  in  particular,  against  Bantu  education   and
discrimination. We remember very well that the  apartheid  regime  responded
to people's resistance with gun-crazy  hooligans  who  had  no  respect  for
human life. They thought that by killing  our  people  they  would  make  us
succumb and crush us into pieces. On the contrary, our struggle  intensified
and reached greater heights.

It was only a matter of time before they had to accept  that  apartheid  had
no future in this country and that the only solution to our problems  was  a
democratic society and a democratic government.

Again amongst  that  generation  was  the  leadership  of  Peter  Ramoshoang
Mokaba. Ra re robala ka kgotso, lesole la rona, qhawe  lamaqhawe.  [Rest  in
peace, our soldier, hero of heroes.]

The theme of ``Letsema: Youth Service for Sustainable  Development''  is  an
appropriate theme to call youth into  action  for  voluntarism.  This  theme
exactly responds to the challenge posed to all of us  by  our  President  at
the beginning of this year  that  all  of  us  must  become  volunteers  for
reconstruction and development. Accordingly, the National  Youth  Commission
and the progressive youth formations  have  embarked  on  a  vigorous  youth
mobilisation programme to ensure the success of our month-long programme  of
action.

Thus far, young people  have  responded  positively  to  this  challenge  of
voluntarism. In  all  communities  young  people  are  engaged  in  cleaning
schools, hospitals and community centres while others are caring  for  those
infected and affected by HIV/Aids and other communicable diseases.

On Saturday I was fortunate enough to be in Richmond, KwaZulu-Natal. All  of
us who are acquainted with Richmond know it to be an area that was  involved
in a great deal of trouble and violence. Today it is a peaceful  area.  When
I was there on Saturday, young people  were  cleaning  the  school  for  the
deaf. Everybody, in particular the young people  of  Richmond,  from  across
party-political boundaries, was participating in that programme of  cleaning
that school. This shows the significance of  the  struggle  that  our  youth
waged in the past. It is beginning  to  bear  fruit.  We  are  beginning  to
realise that peace  is  achievable  and,  indeed,  that  a  better  life  is
achievable under these conditions.

The challenge that remains is that beyond this month, we need  to  inculcate
a culture of voluntarism amongst young people, to do  away  with  tendencies
of material gain and, at all times and  above  everything,  to  inculcate  a
culture of Ubuntu/Botho.

Motswana o rile motho ke motho ka batho  ba  bangwe.  Re  kgona  go  agisana
setshaba fa re dirisa mmogo. [Unity is the power. We can  build  the  nation
if we work together.]

It is what we need to build in our youth.  The  National  Youth  Commission,
the Umsobomvu Youth Fund, the Land Bank and other  state  agencies  will  be
launching various programmes and projects to ensure youth  participation  in
the economy. These projects will mostly be launched  in  the  various  nodal
points  identified  by  the  President.  This  is  in  response   to   youth
unemployment and skill shortages in our country, and in  particular  in  the
nodal points that have been identified.

For instance, the National Youth  Commission  and  the  Land  Bank  will  be
launching youth farming projects in Groblershoop in the  Northern  Cape  and
Bethlehem in the Free State. These farms will be owned, managed and  run  by
young people themselves. They will be accountable and will report  to  those
who will be constituting these youth farming projects.  Indeed,  this  is  a
very noble objective that all of us must support,  which  seeks  to  address
some of the problems that are there.

Although young people still face immense challenges, all  of  us  must  take
collective responsibility in meeting them. Government,  the  private  sector
and society at large must play a  meaningful  role  in  addressing  problems
which affect young people. At the outset  I  must  dispel  the  notion  that
South Africa has failed its youth. South Africa has  not  failed  its  youth
and it will never fail them. Those who  seek  popularity  on  the  basis  of
saying that South Africa has failed its citizens have got no future  in  our
country  and  have  got  no  role  to  play  in  the  advancement   of   our
revolutionary course.

There are indeed challenges which the Minister has highlighted in  terms  of
the  youth  policy.  Central  among  those  is   the   question   of   youth
unemployment. The other issue is the question of the lack  of  skills  among
the young and, in  particular,  the  access  of  those  who  are  previously
disadvantaged to institutions of higher  learning  and  the  fact  that  the
Setas that we have established do not cater for youth  who  are  unemployed.
These are some of the challenges we need to continue to meet.
The other challenge we must address, which continues to plague  us,  is  the
question of poverty and, indeed, problems related to  poverty  with  respect
to HIV/Aids, TB and malaria and other communicable diseases. All of us as  a
collective must respond to it with  vigour  and  enthusiasm.  Again  another
challenge is to ensure that we clearly define the role of the youth  in  the
rebirth of the African continent, in particular with regard to  the  African
Union and Nepad, especially in ensuring that there is popular  participation
by the youth in the success of our continental renaissance.

The other challenge that still remains is the question of youth service,  in
particular how we approach the implementation of the National Youth  Service
Programme, as formulated by the National Youth Commission.

In conclusion I do hope and wish  that  members  of  this  House  and  other
public representatives will prioritise the issue  of  youth  development  in
their constituency work, precisely because the success  and  improvement  of
the living conditions of young people indicate the success of the nation  as
a whole. We owe it to the youth of yesterday, today and tomorrow  to  ensure
that we succeed. We cannot fail and we will never fail, and, indeed,  Afrika
ke nako! [Africa, now is the time!] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): I  allowed  the  youth
one or two more minutes, because there is no other youth  in  the  House,  I
believe. [Laughter.]

Mr  N  M  RAJU:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  in  the  Presidency  and   hon
colleagues, let me also preface my remarks by paying special tribute to  the
youthful Bafana  Bafana  and  echo  sentiments  expressed  by  the  previous
speaker. Though our youthful team made their exit from the World  Cup  today
having lost 2-3 to Spain, they have, however, shown promise, resilience  and
character in the matches played there. That is what  matters  in  the  final
analysis. As a famous Englishman once said,


  For when the One Great Scorer comes
  To write against your name,
  He marks - not that you won or lost -
  But how you played the game.

The team has brought the nation pride and honour, although it failed  to  go
to the second round, but the world has now taken  note  of  the  quality  of
soccer that emanates from the Southern tip of the African continent.  Bafana
Bafana, we love you. [Interjections.]

That the June 1976 uprising of the youth  of  Soweto  played  a  cataclysmic
role in hastening the arrival of a democratic dispensation in  South  Africa
is beyond dispute. That ever since the Vietnam War for instance, it was  the
youth that formed the phalanx of the war battalions is beyond dispute.  That
in  recent  years  also,  in  internecine,  interethnic  wars  that  ravaged
fiercely like an uncontrollable inferno in Central Africa and Sierra  Leone,
the combatants and victims were men and women in their prime is also  beyond
dispute.

Can we then deny that the youth  of  the  world,  wherever  they  may  be  -
indeed, the flowers of the nation, to use  the  description  of  Bob  Dylan,
when he captured the pain and anguish of  the  American  nation  in  a  song
entitled ``Where Have All the Flowers gone?'' - have sacrificed their  lives
in the cause of democracy and freedom, and a  common  brotherhood/sisterhood
of men and women? Can we also doubt that right  here  on  our  doorstep,  in
Boipatong, Katlehong,  Umlazi,  KwaMashu  and  such  places,  when  violence
erupted  in  the  cause  of  political  hegemony,  hundreds  of  our   young
compatriots paid the ultimate price?

So we stand today, as South Africans across the political  spectrum,  either
with our heads bowed or with our fists  raised  in  silent  tribute  to  the
valiant, intrepid, young men and women who led the struggle forward.

But is the struggle really over? For starters, the spectre  of  unemployment
has cast  a  dark  shadow  on  the  future  of  our  youth.  The  anger  and
disillusionment felt by them in our society  is  increasingly  difficult  to
contain. I really sympathise with the Minister,  and  with  the  Government,
because there is no doubt that the Government places a very high premium  on
the development of our youth.

But for national Government's plans to be meaningful, there  must  be  other
players - the provinces, the private sector, the corporate world and  fellow
South Africans - to join forces so that together, hand in hand, we can  take
our youth to greener pastures.

Unfortunately, in recent months, we have seen an ugly side  of  youth  anger
and disillusionment: the  trashing  of  university  campuses,  the  defiance
shown against school management, the looting  and  outright  vandalism.  The
temptation is to condemn these acts as sheer hooliganism and  thuggery,  but
I hear a shrill cry from somewhere that  these  are  the  manifestations  of
tortured souls. The Government and all of us must hearken to  the  plaintive
cries and address the problems that afflict or  hinder  the  development  of
our youth.

I shall refrain from contemplating the ghastly consequences and the toll  of
HIV/Aids that is condemning the flowers of our nation  to  premature  death.
The consequent loss to the economy is  unthinkable.  Poverty  triumphs  when
the most productive of our youth succumb to this pestilence.

We must surely attempt to address the  co-ordination  between  national  and
provincial  government  in  youth  programme  delivery.  We  must  seriously
attempt to manage the roll-out of National Youth Service  projects  and  the
delivery of Government departments. The National Youth  Commission's  public
advocacy and media profile also need revisiting.

Finally, let us harness the enormous energies and goodwill of our youth  for
the betterment of all South Africans. [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  members  of  this  House,  with
roughly half the world's population currently under the  age  of  25,  young
people are a global priority. They will either  threaten  or  contribute  to
the global economy and global security now  and  in  future.  The  goal  for
young people must go beyond survival to development and involvement.  It  is
in their and our interest to ensure  an  adequate  standard  of  living  and
protection  from  economic,  sexual,  emotional   and   physical   harm   or
exploitation.

Global productivity  and  security  will  hinge  on  developing  their  full
potential and engaging them not only as beneficiaries, but  as  participants
and problem-solvers. Research confirms what parents around the  world  know.
Every young person needs five basic things to not only survive  but  thrive:
at least one adult who is irrationally committed to his or her wellbeing;  a
safe place for sleeping, playing, learning, working  and  being;  a  healthy
start and a healthy lifestyle; the chance to contribute  and  serve  others;
and opportunities to learn values and marketable skills for adulthood.

Vanjaar, met die viering van Jeugdag, is die 26ste herdenking van die  1976-
opstande. Die jeug van Suid-Afrika moet voortdurend talle uitdagings in  die
gesig staar. Armoede en onderontwikkeling is die oorsaak van  baie  van  die
euwels in die samelewing. Om hierdie rede  is  die  volgende  tema  in  jeug
geledere aanvaarbaar: ``Letsema, jeugdiens vir volhoubare ontwikkeling.''

Geïnspireer deur die nasionale oproep van Vukuzenzele  moet  daar  gedurende
die jeugontwikkelingsmaand van  Junie,  en  daarna,  'n  aantal  aktiwiteite
plaasvind wat  sal  fokus  op  dienslewering.  Die  skepping  van  'n  soort
vrywilligerskorps  in  alle  gemeenskappe  sal  die  ruggraat  vorm  om  die
volhoubaarheid van jeugdiens, ook ná Junie, te verseker.

Die jeug moet ook kennis neem van die  belangrike  besluite  wat  geneem  is
deur die leiers van die kontinent van Afrika vir die transformasie  van  die
Organisasie vir Afrika-Eenheid na die Afrika Unie, en die loodsing  van  die
Nuwe  Vennootskap  vir  Afrika  se  Ontwikkeling  (Nepad).  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This year, with  the  celebration  of  Youth  Day,  it  will  be  the  26th
anniversary of the 1976 unrest. The youth of South Africa must  continuously
face numerous challenges. Poverty and underdevelopment are the root of  many
evils in society. For this reason the following theme is acceptable  amongst
the youth: "Letsema, youth service for sustainable development.''

Inspired by the national call for Vukuzenzele, a number of  activities  that
will focus on delivery of service must take place  during  June,  the  month
for youth development, and afterwards. The creation of a type  of  volunteer
corps  in  all  communities  will  form   the   backbone   to   ensure   the
sustainability of youth service, even after June.
The youth must take note of the important decisions taken by the leaders  of
the African  continent  for  the  transformation  of  the  Organisation  for
African Unity to the African Union, and the launch of  the  New  Partnership
for African Development, Nepad.]

Yet alongside this growing urgency, there is  hope.  There  are  people  and
programmes throughout the world that are effectively meeting young  people's
needs. In the same vein,  the  youth  must  be  supported  to  fulfil  their
potential through proper parenting and upbringing, as well  as  through  the
acquisition of functional education and skills.  Adequate  recreational  and
sporting facilities, as well as opportunities in the arts, must be  provided
to ensure the all-round development of South African youth.

The youth must focus on holistic  development,  emphasising  prevention  and
early intervention, not just treatment and remediation; the  development  of
a young person's character, competence, confidence and connectedness to  his
or her community; and the active involvement of youth in  carrying  out  the
programmes, combined with involvement by parents and community  members,  so
all feel they have invested in a programme's success.

Sustaining  effective  practice  goes  far  beyond   individual   programmes
themselves. It requires commitment at all levels of society  to  the  issues
facing today's young people and our collective  future.  It  requires  sound
government policies. It requires  co-ordinated  efforts  among  the  public,
private and nonprofit sectors. No  one  organisation  or  group  can  do  it
alone. That is why we must forge strategic partnerships, helping to build  a
critical mass of understanding, commitment and action in support of  today's
children and youth.

Over the past years, we have seen the  important  role  which  the  hon  the
President, the hon the Minister in the Presidency, provincial Ministers  and
the National Youth Commission are playing  in  enhancing  and  strengthening
the role of the youth.

We in the New NP know  that  our  future  depends  on  the  quality  of  the
development of our youth. We will therefore do everything in  our  power  to
ensure sustainable development of the highest possible quality for  all  our
youth and continue  constructively  to  participate  in  the  mainstream  of
politics, so that we can make a meaningful, positive contribution to  making
our country work and to creating a better future for our youth and  all  our
people. [Applause.]

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, in the name of my Creator and  in  the  name
of my Saviour Jesus Christ I greet this honourable House. Let  me  wish  all
fathers a happy Fathers' Day. A happy Fathers' Day also to all  mothers  who
act as fathers in their homes. [Interjections.] As a tribute to  my  leader,
Comrade Peter Mokaba, I would like to say to him:  Go  well  and  tell  them
that the youth are still on track. Without you, as the former  president  of
the ANC Youth League, no one is going to put  the  perspective  of  the  ANC
Youth League in the correct way there in heaven, because I believe that  the
ANC is also governing somewhere.

We hold this debate on the eve of the 23rd  anniversary  of  Youth  Day.  As
this historic event is remembered,  the  ANC  Youth  League  is  calling  on
today's youth to continue that struggle for a better society on a  sustained
basis through a volunteer corps. The youth must volunteer to register  needy
children for the child support grant and to clean schools and public  spaces
in communities.

The 1976 youth uprising has formed a permanent feature  in  the  history  of
the liberation struggle in South Africa. The freedom  that  we  enjoy  today
has largely been shaped by deliberate  youth  action  in  our  country.  The
contribution of many young people  in  fighting  the  previous  undemocratic
regime cannot be questioned.  It  is  there  to  be  seen  in  the  struggle
embodied in the gallant and selfless service of uMkhonto weSizwe, with  many
young people swelling its ranks. It  is  fitting  that  Youth  Month  should
provide the necessary zeal and activism and inspire all to  serve  to  build
reconciliation and unite all South Africans. This Youth Month should  revive
the spirit of patriotism shown by the class of the 1970s and 1980s, many  of
whom gave up their youth in exchange for the freedom we enjoy  today.  Youth
month is a month that repositions us as youth firmly  in  the  path  of  the
African Renaissance.

It is also important to note that our young people live at a time  when  the
whole of Africa is liberated. One significant factor about our youth in  our
country today is that they see beyond immediate  demands  and  aspire  to  a
fundamental change in the socioeconomic situation. The  youth  today  should
be in the forefront of the struggle to reconstruct and develop our  country.


Youth faces challenges across the spectrum of society, whether it be in  the
home environment from abusive parents,  in  the  schools  from  exploitative
educators, in the communities from rapists  and  child-traffickers,  in  the
economy from job shortages or in their health from deadly diseases  such  as
HIV/Aids.

We must make a clarion call to the youth to be involved  in  national  youth
service for sustainable development. Our young people must be encouraged  to
respond  to  the  President's  calls  for  volunteer  work.  They  must   be
encouraged to lend a helping hand in the following areas: being part of  the
fight against drug abuse; joining the reservists,  road  construction  youth
brigades or community policing forums; being informers and assisting in  the
fight against crime and against the abuse of women and children;  mobilising
the youth and community around  the  objectives  of  Nepad;  mobilising  and
uniting African youth in  the  defence  of  the  African  Union;  struggling
against the scourge of HIV/Aids; and fighting to eradicate  poverty  through
the Vukuzenzele concept.

The youth need a skills-orientated type of education so as to  fit  well  in
an economic market. If the children and youth of a nation are  afforded  the
opportunity to develop their capacity to the fullest, if they are given  the
knowledge to understand the world and the wisdom  to  change  it,  then  the
prospects for the future are bright. In contrast, a society  which  neglects
its children,  however  well  it  may  function  in  other  respects,  risks
eventual disorganisation and demise. To us every South African  is  valuable
and therefore irreplaceable. Sustainable moral regeneration in society  will
allow our youth to have role models in their communities. [Applause.]

Mr T B  TAABE:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  Comrade  Essop  Pahad  and  hon
members, we meet here today on the eve of the celebration and  commemoration
of the struggle of the youth  of  this  country  spanning  decades.  Today's
debate on sustainable  youth  development  therefore  remains  relevant  and
befitting this occasion.

One of  the  gallant  fighters  of  our  times,  the  late  Comrade  Solomon
Mahlangu, who went to the gallows on 6 April 1979, had this to  say,  and  I
quote:


  My blood will nourish the tree that will bear the fruit of freedom.  Tell
  my people that I love them and that they must continue the struggle.

I thought it was indeed critical to raise this today  in  the  light  of  us
making a concerted effort  to  fight  poverty,  the  HIV/Aids  epidemic  and
problems relating to colossal  unemployment  and  other  socioeconomic  ills
facing young people in this country today.

Our President asked an equally significant question on 5  April  2001,  when
he asked, and I quote:


  Why did our Youth perform heroic feats of  struggle  in  1976  and  later
  years? Why does our country owe them a permanent debt?

It so is precisely because our country at one stage had no  hope  of  making
progress in the political, economic, social  and  cultural  spheres  because
apartheid madness had become a heavy chain  blocking  all  development.  The
situation at the time demanded that our people as a  whole  understood  that
they could not delegate the struggle to somebody else while they waited  for
victory day so  that  they  could  join  the  celebrations.  Hence,  in  the
centrality of the mass struggle, in our strategy  for  the  victory  of  the
national democratic revolution, the youth  added  enormously  to  that  mass
struggle. In fact the youth of this country led such  struggles.  We  should
continuously remind ourselves of why we owe our youth a permanent debt,  but
also, above all, of why we must ensure that the youth play a proactive  role
in the transformation of this country.

Whatever strategy we employ as the ANC to  address  the  complex  challenges
facing young people must,  therefore,  unmask  past  imbalances  and  issues
relating to gender inclusivity, combat racism, ensure ongoing  participation
of the youth in matters affecting them and - as we used to  say  during  the
heyday of our struggle in the words of  the  popular  slogan  -  attack  the
enemy on all fronts. This time around I guess we  should  be  talking  about
attacking the Aids enemy on all fronts. I think this is  the  most  pressing
challenge facing us today as young people.

The determination of young people to liberate this  country  from  apartheid
and inequality is still needed for sustainable youth  development.  We  must
celebrate with the youth of our country  the  fact  that  new  opportunities
have opened up for them irrespective of race, colour, creed or sex.

As the ANC we have committed ourselves to mobilising our people,  the  youth
in particular, to become participants in the process of  the  reconstruction
and development of our country. We have resolved on  strategies  that  would
seek to end the situation of the demobilisation of  young  people,  some  of
whom have come to believe that all that they  have  to  do  is  to  wait  to
receive whatever benefits the Government can bring  them.  We  believe  that
young people must be organised and activated to become their own  liberators
from poverty and underdevelopment.

The programmes we have engaged in as the  ANC  this  year,  which  has  been
declared the Year of the Volunteer, we hope have made and will  continue  to
make a positive difference to the lives of young  people  in  this  country.
These activities were not and are not,  we  contend,  once-off  efforts  but
rather part of a programme which communities can sustain. We would  continue
to encourage the youth to contribute to a culture of community  service  and
development throughout the length and breadth of our country.

We must assert that this development requires the  support  of  all  sectors
and not only Government. In this vein, the time has  come  to  call  on  our
brothers  and  sisters,  particularly  in  the  black  economic  empowerment
sector, to match the commitment which we have made  as  the  youth  of  this
country and indeed as Government in terms  of  ensuring  that  they  can  be
drawn into the epicentre of the country's economy.  They  must  plough  back
into our communities to provide for much-needed skills for young people  and
for the creation of much-needed jobs, for they are faced with a very  simple
and  stark  choice.  They  must  either  practically  assist  the  youth  in
sustainable projects or they will relegate our youth to a future of  poverty
and underdevelopment. At worst they run the risk  of  wanting  to  create  a
nation whose culture is rooted in enrichment, individualism and  narcissism,
a nation without a common purpose, pursuing its own goals at  the  peril  of
the youth of this country. I think this is the challenge we must put to  our
brothers, particularly in the BEE, or  block  economic  empowerment  sector.
What, then, is the potential role that  our  business  community  could  and
should be playing in our journey towards  building  a  human  society  whose
youth is empowered?

Our national campaign must be built on our  passion  to  contribute  towards
and share in the experience of the  realisation  of  the  potential  of  our
South African youth. Our vision should therefore be one of a  South  African
community where we all have a commitment to  social  and  economic  justice,
where we share in the custodianship of and take co-responsibility  with  our
fellow South Africans for extending the  socioeconomic  wellbeing  of  young
South Africans across the racial divide and spectrum.

To the youth of our country, wherever they are, in case  they  are  watching
this debate this afternoon, I have these words to say: The new challenge  is
a continuation of struggles that we  have  been  waging  in  the  past.  The
reward for the new struggle is the ability to challenge obstacles.  Ignoring
them is equal to failure. [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson,  let  me  reiterate  once  more
what I said last week when I was here. It is always  a  pleasure  to  be  in
this House. The hon members are very nice. They are very kind to each  other
and to the Ministers too. [Laughter.] Let me  thank  all  of  the  speakers.
There are some powerful orators here, and perhaps  Comrade  Peter  did  hear
the message.

If I had closed my eyes when listening the hon Mr Raju  I  would  have  been
able to tell his age, but I can tell now because of his grey  hair.  I  want
to thank him for reminding this House about a period in the life of  all  of
us, the Vietnamese struggle and what happened then. But,  just  in  case,  I
would like to tell Mr Raju that ``Where have all the flowers gone?'' is  not
a Bob Dylan song. It is an old American folk song made famous by Joan  Baez.
Hon members can tell my age from that. [Laughter.]

But we were all young once, including the President of this country, who  at
one stage was a leader of the ANC Youth  League.  On  Sunday,  which  is  16
June, after he officially launches Freedom Park in Pretoria, he will  go  to
Bloemfontein to attend the national  Youth  Celebrations  organised  by  the
National Youth Commission, because it is one his tasks and  responsibilities
to ensure that on national Youth Day, at least, he speaks to  the  youth  of
our country.

In case hon members did not know, on 18 June, when we  have  the  debate  on
the Presidency's Budget Vote in the National Assembly, he will no longer  be
young, he is going to turn 60. We are going to welcome him  into  the  ranks
of the veterans, because he will have left his youth behind.  On  Sunday  he
can make his last speech as a youth, because he will turn 60 on 18 June.

Let me  also  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Deputy  Minister  for
Provincial and Local Government for allowing my two debates to  come  before
hers. She very kindly agreed to that. I did explain to her that  I  have  to
rush somewhere else.

Once  more  I  would  like  to  thank  the  NCOP  very  much  for  all   the
opportunities that it has given me. I cannot wait to  go  to  the  renovated
Chamber to do this. I am a bit tired of coming here - of walking  past  this
building and going to the NCOP  Chamber,  then  seeing  building  works  and
saying,``Oh God! They are still in the  Old  Assembly''.  [Laughter.]  Could
the hon members of the NCOP please ask them to hurry up so that I can go  to
the right place at the right time when I am  invited  again?  I  thank  this
House very much for all the invitations. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Ms Versfeld,  I
am sorry, but I did not see you. On what are you rising?

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, on a point of order: I  would  like  to  know
whether it is advisable for the Deputy Minister to swear in this Chamber.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Who  is  the
Deputy Minister, by the way? [Interjections.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, I am speaking to the Chair.  I  am  asking  a
question. Is it advisable to swear? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Who is  that?  Do  not
speak in parables. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, I  am  a  Minister  and  not  a
Deputy Minister, to start with. [Laughter.] Through the  Chair,  if  she  is
offended, I withdraw the word. I do not see why she should be  so  offended,
but OK.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Thank you. [Interjections.]

Debate concluded.

   COMMISSION FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF CULTURAL,
                  RELIGIOUS AND LINGUISTIC COMMUNITIES BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson,  I  am
not sure which Chairperson I ought to thank. [Laughter.]

First of all, I would like to pay a special  tribute  to  the  late  Comrade
Peter Mokaba. I wish to express my deepest sympathy to his family,  comrades
and friends. May his soul rest in peace.

May I just correct one thing? My initials are N G W, and not  L.  They  have
taken the wind out of my sails, because it is now 18:55.

We come from a past when the policies of the then Government  were  designed
to treat Bantus, coloureds  and  Indians,  as  they  were  then  called,  as
inferior citizens of this country - a time when the cultures, religions  and
languages of the indigenous people of this  country  were  deliberately  and
systematically  stifled  or  obliterated.  By  introducing  this  piece   of
legislation, we believe that we can, all together as a nation, find ways  of
ending this legacy of the past, which was brought about by  colonialism  and
apartheid.

The Bill that we are debating today, in this House, is a national effort  to
find a sustainable way of addressing the interests and  aspirations  of  all
the cultural, religious and linguistic groups within our diverse society  in
a balanced manner which would, in the final analysis, benefit the nation  as
a  whole.  We  should  therefore  desist  from  creating  false  hopes   and
expectations.

Let us also be reminded today that, in 1996, we adopted  a  Constitution  in
which we proudly declared that we ``believe that  South  Africa  belongs  to
all who live in it, united in our diversity'', and this we need  to  uphold.
In his speech opening the National Assembly debate on the  establishment  of
the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities in August 1998, President Thabo  Mbeki,
then the Deputy President, challenged all of us to identify  the  role  that
each one of us would play in the transformation process in our  country.  He
directed the question to all of us when he said (Hansard 1998, col 4611):


  What is it that we will  have  to  do  together  to  overturn  the  great
  inequalities created by our colonial and apartheid  past?  What  must  be
  done to create a  situation  of  equality  among  our  diverse  cultural,
  religious and linguistic groups so that they can live and build  a  happy
  future together in conditions of peace and friendship,  united  by  their
  common humanity?

As we debate in this House today, I would ask that we keep this in mind.

I  believe  that  this  Bill,  particularly  the   establishment   of   this
commission,  is  an  important  step   in   strengthening   South   Africa's
constitutional  democracy   and   the   process   of   nation-building   and
reconciliation which our Government embarked upon in 1994.

Equality for all citizens is the  cornerstone  of  our  Constitution,  which
embodies the core  founding  values  of  the  South  African  state,  namely
nonracialism and nonsexism. It  is  for  this  reason  that  we  consciously
incorporated, in section 185 of the Constitution,  the  primary  objects  of
the commission, which are: to promote respect for the  rights  of  cultural,
religious  and  linguistic  communities;  to  promote  and  develop   peace,
friendship,  humanity,  tolerance  and  national   unity   among   cultural,
religious  and  linguistic  communities,   on   the   basis   of   equality,
nondiscrimination and free association; and to recommend  the  establishment
or recognition, in accordance with national legislation, of  a  cultural  or
other council or councils for a community or communities in South Africa.

The challenge is to demonstrate that within a culture  of  nonracialism  and
nonsexism,  various  cultural,  religious  and  linguistic  communities  can
prosper and jointly  provide  content  to  the  South  African  nation.  The
commission has the task of promoting this unity in  diversity  as  envisaged
in the preamble to the Constitution. This Bill provides  for  the  following
objects  of  the  commission:  to  promote  respect  for  and  further   the
protection  of  the  rights  of  the  cultural,  religious  and   linguistic
communities; to promote and develop peace, friendship,  humanity,  tolerance
and national unity among  and  within  cultural,  religious  and  linguistic
communities;  to  foster  mutual  respect  among  cultural,  religious   and
linguistic communities; to promote  the  right  of  communities  to  develop
their historically diminished heritage; and to recommend  the  establishment
or recognition of community councils.

The Bill enables the commission to monitor, investigate, research,  educate,
lobby, advise and report on any issues concerning the  rights  of  cultural,
religious and linguistic communities. The  commission  may  also  bring  any
relevant matter to the attention of appropriate authority.

The involvement of cultural, religious and  linguistic  communities  in  the
work of the commission is provided for  through  the  national  consultative
conferences. The commission must convene two conferences during every  five-
year term of the  commission,  consisting  of  delegates  from  the  various
cultural,  religious  and  linguistic  communities  and   governmental   and
nongovernmental role-players. The purpose of  the  conferences  will  be  to
provide a forum for discussion and for the evaluation  of  progress  and  to
provide an opportunity for requests and recommendations to the commission.

The  Bill  links  the  commission  to  communities  by  providing  for   the
recognition of community  councils.  The  aims  of  community  councils  are
described in the Bill as, firstly, to  preserve,  promote  and  develop  the
culture, religion and language of the community for which it  is  recognised
and,  secondly,  to  advise  the  commission  on,  and  assist  in,  matters
concerning the achievement of the objects of the commission.

The Bill provides that the commission be composed of a  chairperson  and  no
fewer than 11 and no more than 17 other members appointed by  the  President
in accordance with a procedure set out in the Bill. The commission  must  be
broadly representative  of  the  main  cultural,  religious  and  linguistic
communities and broadly reflect the gender composition of South Africa.

Given the historical legacy of division  in  our  country,  the  process  of
establishing the commission needs to be managed in such  a  manner  that  it
enhances tolerance  and  unity,  rather  than  promotes  ethnic  and  racial
prejudices. In order to achieve  this,  the  Department  of  Provincial  and
Local Government and  the  technical  committee  embarked  on  an  elaborate
process of  consultation  in  1998,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  inclusive
deliberations  and  collective  ownership   of   the   commission   by   all
stakeholders.

The commission is one of  the  constitutional  institutions  supporting  our
democracy. By giving effect to the Constitution  through  the  establishment
of this commission, we, as South Africans, are contributing to  the  process
of building a  united  and  democratic  nation.  The  establishment  of  the
Commission for the Promotion and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities is only the start of a  long  and  hard
road. I do believe that we are on course. However, time  will  tell  whether
we are able to meet the challenge posed by President Thabo Mbeki.

In conclusion, I wish to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  technical
committee, under the able leadership  of  Prof  Marivate,  who  handled  the
consultation processes meticulously and with  dedication.  I  also  wish  to
thank the Select Committee on Local Government and Administration,  as  well
as the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government, for the  hard
work which resulted in this exceptional piece of legislation.

Lastly, I would like to thank the officials of the Department of  Provincial
and Local Government who assisted  both  the  technical  committee  and  the
parliamentary  committees.  I  commend  this  Bill  to  the   hon   members.
[Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Deputy  Minister  and  hon  members,  the
concept of the commission emerged from a heated debate  over  whether  South
Africa's new  Constitution  should  balance  the  protection  of  individual
rights with mechanisms to protect the collective rights  of  South  Africa's
various cultural, religious and linguistic communities. At that time,  1994-
1996, this position was advanced most forcefully by proponents of  Afrikaner
nationalism. In its strongest, or should I say most  negative,  version,  it
took  the  form  of  a  call  for  political   autonomy   through   separate
administrative structures such as the now defunct volkstaat.

The Constitutional Assembly overwhelmingly rejected this approach.  However,
as a comprise, it provided for  a  special  commission  that  could  prevent
discrimination against any  cultural,  religious  or  linguistic  group  and
promote tolerance and mutual respect amongst these various  groups.  Several
drafts of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the  Rights  of
Cultural, Religious  and  Linguistic  Communities  Bill  were  discussed  at
national conferences on Heritage Day, 24 September, in 1998  and  1999,  and
at provincial workshops held in the middle of 2000.

Of the six state institutions mandated to support  constitutional  democracy
in this  country,  the  Commission  for  the  Promotion  and  Protection  of
Cultural, Religious  and  Linguistic  Communities  is  the  only  Chapter  9
institution not yet established  as  contemplated  in  section  181  of  the
Constitution. Therefore, part of our business  here  today  is  to  finalise
this piece of legislation, not only to comply with the stipulations  of  our
Constitution, but to bring  closer  to  reality  the  noble  notion  of  our
founding fathers - that is, to nurture an enabling environment for  a  free,
nonracial, nonsexist and united society.

The drafters of our Constitution, in their wisdom,  rightly  recognised  the
power of persuasion as opposed to compulsion in order to  achieve  a  change
of mindset. While it is possible, perhaps, to  enforce  the  tenets  of  the
Bill of Rights, a lasting transformation of a mindset is better achieved  by
persuasion.  This  explains  the  difference  in   approach   between   this
commission and the other Chapter 9 institutions.

True to the spirit of the drafters, the operative terms in  this  Bill  are,
amongst  others,  ``promote'',  ``protect'',  ``persuade'',   ``recommend'',
``facilitate''  and  ``co-ordinate''.  This  puts  the  intention   of   the
legislator clearly, so that the commission's functions  do  not  necessarily
overlap  with  those  of  other  institutions  performing   almost   similar
functions. Wider consultation and research has, on my part,  eliminated  the
perceived grey areas when the functions of this  commission  and  those  of,
perhaps, the Human Rights Commission are compared.

Closer  and  objective  scrutiny  of  the  arrangements  for  the  effective
functioning of the commission reassures one that this commission will  be  a
credible and accountable institution with the requisite power and  resources
to fulfil the mandate of healing  the  wounds  of  the  past,  progressively
achieving  unity  in  our  diversity  while  we  respect  and  tolerate  the
cultures, religions and languages of one another.

I am sure that each of us practises and,  to  some  extent,  enjoys,  though
sometimes unaware of doing so, the  culture  of  one  or  the  other  group.
Distorted  and  discredited  history  books  of  Bantu  education  portrayed
hunting as a culture of primitive people. But now who goes  out  on  hunting
safaris these days? I will not bore hon members  with  the  answer.  If  hon
members doubt my assertion, could they explain the mushrooming  of  thatched
rondavels in the elite suburbs of our cities? In one way or the other,  each
one of us spontaneously but subconsciously declares: ``Hi, Mr Khoi.  I  need
your language in order to augment the culture which I am enjoying and  which
I learnt from Mr San.''

Passing this piece of legislation today will  go  a  long  way  towards  the
advancement of the noble project of nation-building. [Applause.]

Ms  C  S  BOTHA:   Chairperson   and   hon   Deputy   Minister   Botha   ...
[Interjections.] ... globalisation presupposes that the dominant culture  is
the acceptable culture. In this  regard,  the  dominant  culture  assumes  a
homogenisation of cultures. This is a  problem.  We  in  this  part  of  the
world, seized as we are with a variety of cultures, have to ensure that  our
cultures live. Our cultural diversity must survive.

This is a direct quote, not from a South  African  publication,  as  members
might have thought, but from the ambassador from Saint Kitts and Nevis at  a
conference on the Caribbean.

Sela en amen. Politieke vryheid gee implisiet erkenning aan diversiteit.  'n
Uniforme  gemeenskap  sal  net  deur  dwang  tot  stand  kom  en  is  lynreg
teenstrydig met die grondliggende filosofie van die  DA.  Daarom  steun  ons
dus enige wetgewing wat die diversiteit  eie  aan  ons  in  Suid-Afrika  wil
koester en ook hierdie wetgewing.

Ons neem die Grondwet ernstig op, wat aan almal die gegee  reg  het  om  die
taal van sy of haar keuse te gebruik. Ek wil sommer al 11 amptelike tale  in
die Grondwet by naam noem, so mooi is  hulle:  Sepedi,  Sesoetoe,  Setswana,
Siswati, Tsivenda, Xitsonga,  Afrikaans,  Engels,  isiNdebele,  isiXhosa  en
isiZulu. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Daarby het ons die bepaling van die PanSAT  wat  alle  amptelike  tale  moet
bevorder en ontwikkel. Dit klink  alles  wonderlik,  maar  is  dit?  Hierdie
Regering oortuig my nie daarvan dat dit hulle erns is om  in  enigiets  meer
as lippetaal te betuig aan hierdie vrome wetgewing nie.

Die Engelssprekende eentalige Minister Asmal  kom  gister  weer  in  hierdie
Huis met 'n stelling dat taal nie 'n hindernis moet wees vir  toelating  van
enige student tot die Universiteit van Stellenbosch  en  Potchefstroom  nie.
Goed en wel, maar wat beteken dit?  Overgeset  synde:  Afrikaans  moet  plek
maak vir Engels. Let  wel,  hy  vra  nie  dat  Engels  moet  plek  maak  vir
Afrikaans by die Universiteit van Kaapstad nie. Dit gaan  in  wese  net  oor
die posisie wat Afrikaans het.

Wat beteken dit vir al die ander amptelike tale? Dit beteken maar hulle  kan
hul moedertaalbehoeftes op hulle magies skryf en  met  hul  hempies  uitvee.
Hierso kry ek vandag van die Minister af 'n hele  klomp  boeke  -  11  tale,
almal amptelike tale. Hy wil vertel dat ons tot standerd  9  en  10  al  die
lieflike tale leer. En wat gebeur dan daarna? As  hy  nie  eens  in  hierdie
stadium kans sien dat Afrikaans sy  regmatige  plek  aan  die  universiteite
inneem nie, wat gaan hy met al hierdie ander tale maak wat julle mense  hier
praat? [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons sal sien. Hy sal  maak  wat  hy  met  Afrikaans
maak. Nie een van daardie tale sal tot hulle reg kom in  hierdie  land  nie.
Al ons praatjies van kulturele diversiteit gaan van die tafel gevee word.

Neville Alexander het vandeesweek die benadering  van  die  Minister  op  sy
naam genoem. Hy sê dit is nonsens. Dit beteken dat sprekers hul reg  op  hul
taal moet opsê, omdat ander dit nie  verstaan  nie.  Vergeet  van  die  mooi
lysie van taalname wat ek voorheen genoem het. As dit van  hierdie  Regering
en sy meelopers afhang, dan is dit: Engels,  Engels,  alles  Engels.  Engels
wat jy sien en hoor - en die res is niks meer as 'n  slampamperliedjie  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Amen to that. Political freedom implicitly recognises diversity. A  uniform
community will only come into being by force and  is  in  direct  opposition
with the  fundamental  philosophy  of  the  DA.  We  therefore  support  any
legislation which seeks to nurture the  diversity  unique  to  us  in  South
Africa, and also this legislation.

We take the Constitution seriously, which has given everyone  the  right  to
use the language of his or her choice. I would just  like  to  name  all  11
official languages in the  Constitution.  They  are  so  beautiful:  Sepedi,
Sesotho,  Setswana,  siSwati,  Tsivenda,   Xitsonga,   Afrikaans,   English,
isiNdebele, isiXhosa and isiZulu. [Interjections.]

In addition to that we have the stipulation of PanSALB  which  must  promote
and develop all official languages. This all sounds wonderful,  but  is  it?
This Government is not convincing me  that  they  are  serious  about  doing
anything more than paying lip service to this pious legislation.

The English-speaking, unilingual Minister Asmal made a statement here  again
in this  House  yesterday  that  language  should  not  be  an  obstacle  to
admission  to  the  University  of  Stellenbosch  and  the   University   of
Potchefstroom for any student. That is all well and good, but what  does  it
mean? In my opinion: Afrikaans must make way for English.  Please  note,  he
is not asking that English should make way for Afrikaans at  the  University
of Cape Town. The  issue  is  essentially  just  about  the  position  which
Afrikaans holds.

What does this mean for all the other  official  languages?  It  means  that
their mother-tongue needs are merely  wishful  thinking.  Today  I  received
from the Minister a whole  pile  of  books  -  11  languages,  all  official
languages. He  says  that  we  learn  all  the  beautiful  languages  up  to
standards 9 and 10. And what happens after that? If at this  stage  he  does
not even see his way clear for Afrikaans to take its rightful place  at  the
universities, what is he going to do with all these  other  languages  which
you people speak here? [Interjections.] We will see. He will do what  he  is
doing with Afrikaans. Not one of those languages will come  into  their  own
in this country. All our talk about cultural diversity is going to be  wiped
from the table.

This week Neville Alexander called the Minister's approach by its  name.  He
said it is nonsense. It means that speakers have to give up their  right  to
their language, because others do not understand it. Forget the lovely  list
of languages which I mentioned earlier. If it were  up  to  this  Government
and its followers, then it would be: English, English,  everything  English.
What you heard and saw would be English - and the rest nothing more  than  a
carousal song. [Interjections.]]

Chairperson, please help me here with this gentleman.

Die ANC is so gretig om die Wes-Kaap in hul mag te kry en die  Nuwe  NP  ...
[The ANC are so keen to get the Western Cape under  their  control  and  the
New NP ...]

Mr V V W WINDVOëL: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it in order for  the
hon member to refer to  us  as  ``you  people'',  instead  of  saying  ``hon
members''? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, can you respond  to  that?
Did you say that?

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, yes, certainly. I will rephrase, ``the  languages
of all the hon members here''. I agree, it is  most  preferable  to  put  it
that way.

Ons mense, julle mense, almal wat hier sit,  ek,  ons  almal.  [Our  people,
your people, everyone who is sitting here, myself, all of us.]  But  I  will
say ``the hon people''. It is preferable by far. I have so many  interesting
things to say about languages that I will have to  cut  out  of  my  speech,
because I know my time has been used by  this  question.  Therefore  I  will
concentrate on one or two points.

Die ANC is so gretig om die Wes-Kaap in hul mag te kry en die Nuwe NP is  so
haastig om hulle daarmee te help, dat die  Nasionaliste  bereid  is  om  hul
geboortereg  vir  'n  pot  lensiesop  te  verkoop.   Hier   is   derduisende
Afrikaanssprekendes wat gewag het om van  die  NP  ontslae  te  raak,  sodat
Afrikaans ook bevry kan word van sy politieke juk.  Wat  gebeur  nou?  Alles
behalwe Engels word die slagoffer van die historiese  stryd  van  mense  wat
nie slaag daarin om die uitdagings van 'n nuwe  en  diverse  Suid-Afrika  te
bemeester nie.

As die kommissie effektief gaan wees, sal dit onder andere moet kennis  neem
dat van die 5 000 tot 7 000 tale wat vandag in die wêreld gepraat  word  ...
[Tussenwerpsels.]  Ag  nee,  man.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[The ANC are so keen to get the Western Cape in their power and the  New  NP
is so hasty to help them to do that, that the Nationalists are  prepared  to
sell their birthright  for  a  mess  of  pottage.  There  are  thousands  of
Afrikaans speakers here who were waiting to  get  rid  of  the  NP  so  that
Afrikaans  could  also  be  liberated  from  its  political  yoke.  What  is
happening now? Everything apart from English is becoming the victim  of  the
historical struggle by people  who  are  not  succeeding  in  mastering  the
challenges of a new and diverse South Africa.

It the commission is going to be effective, it will,  inter  alia,  have  to
note that of the 5 000 to 7 000 languages which  are  spoken  in  the  world
today ... [Interjections.] Oh no, man.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, on a point of order: Has the hon  member's  time
not expired yet? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  I  do  not  know,  but  that  is  my
responsibility. Will you please continue, hon member?

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, what I can say is that that  particular  member's
membership of his party, or rather his party itself,  has  expired.  That  I
can tell you. [Laughter.]

As die kommissie effektief gaan wees, sal dit onder andere moet kennis  neem
dat van die 5 000 to 7 000 tale wat  vandag  in  die  wêreld  gepraat  word,
omtrent 2 500 op die punt is om uit te  sterf.  Vir  oorlewing  van  ons  11
tale, benodig hulle die volgende: Hulle moet tuis gepraat word;  hulle  moet
'n  literêre  en  letterkundige  bestaan  hê;  hulle  moet  wetenskaplik  en
akademies  gebruik  word;  hulle  moet  ekonomiese  nut  hê  en  hulle  moet
owerheidsfunksies ook hê. Dit is wat betref taal. Dit raak nog nie  aan  die
kritieke debatte rondom godsdiens en kultuur, wat  ook  deur  die  kommissie
aangespreek moet word nie.

Die Suid-Afrikaanse transformasie het impetus  gegee  aan  'n  trotse,  nie-
rassistiese Suid-Afrikaanse identiteit. Ek het  my  verheerlik  in  Minister
Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi se woorde gister toe sy  gesê  het:  ``Djy  moenie
krap waar dit nie djeuk nie.''

Dit veroorsaak dat ek vir die eerste keer in my lewe met Pieter  Mulder  kan
saamstem, waar hy sê dat die tyd nou aangebreek het  om  in  ons  gemeenskap
oor dié saak oor politieke grense heen, saam te werk. Helaas,  ook  om  saam
te stem met ANC-portefeuljekomiteevoorsitter Yunus Carrim.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[If the commission is going to be effective, it will,  inter  alia  have  to
note that of the 5 000 to 7 000 languages which  are  spoken  in  the  world
today, approximately 2 500 are on the verge of dying out. In order  for  our
11 languages to survive they need the following:  they  must  be  spoken  at
home; they must have a literary existence; they must be used  scientifically
and academically; they must have  economic  use  and  they  must  also  have
government functions. That is as far as language  is  concerned.  That  does
not yet touch on the critical  debates  surrounding  religion  and  culture,
which must also be addressed by the commission.

The South African transformation has given impetus to  a  proud,  non-racist
South African identity. Yesterday I celebrated  Minister  Geraldine  Fraser-
Moleketi's words when she said: ``Djy moenie krap waar dit nie djeuk  nie.''
[Don't meddle in other people's affairs.]

This means that for the first time in  my  life  I  can  agree  with  Pieter
Mulder, when he says that the time has now come in our communities  to  work
together on this matter across political boundaries. Unfortunately, also  to
agree with ANC portfolio committee chairperson Yunus Carrim.]

If the  commission  works  effectively,  it  will  serve  to  gradually  de-
emphasise racial identities by giving expression to  ethnic  identity  in  a
way that is reconcilable with the emergence  of  a  national  South  African
identity.[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and hon membersÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  Mev
Botha praat so baie van Afrikaans en praat so sleg  van  Engels,  maar  haar
leier  is  'n  Engelssprekende  persoon  wat  nooit  Afrikaans  praat   nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.]  En  ons  tale  is  net  so  belangrik  soos  haar   taal.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Mrs Botha talks so much  about  Afrikaans  and  talks  so
badly about English, but her leader is an English-speaking person who  never
speaks Afrikaans. [Interjections.] And our languages are just  as  important
as her language. [Interjections.]]

Over the years we have put forward  and  sustained  the  position  that  the
creation of the material conditions that would both underpin  and  represent
nation-building and reconciliation could only be achieved over a  protracted
period of time. This is confirmed by the fact that the Government  of  South
Africa continues to lay a solid basis for our constitutional democracy.

The 1993 Constitution  of  the  Republic  ends  with  an  epilogue  entitled
``National Unity and Reconciliation''. Among other things it says:


  This Constitution provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply
  divided society characterised by strife, conflict, untold  suffering  and
  injustice, and a future founded  on  the  recognition  of  human  rights,
  democracy and peaceful co-existence and development opportunities for all
  South Africans, irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex.


  The pursuit of  national  unity,  the  wellbeing  of  all  South  African
  citizens and peace require reconciliation between  the  people  of  South
  Africa and the reconstruction of society.

The 1996 Constitution took this mandate a little step further, in  the  form
of Chapter 9. This Bill gives effect to the provisions of sections 181,  185
and 186 of the Constitution, which established, as one of  the  institutions
strengthening constitutional democracy, a Commission for the  Promotion  and
Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities.

This Bill stems from the fact that the South African nation  consists  of  a
diversity of  cultural,  religious  and  linguistic  communities.  The  past
policies have bequeathed a legacy of division and inequality  between  these
communities. In trying to correct these structural flaws, our  Constitution,
through  this  Bill,  seeks  to  heal  these  divisions  of  the   past   by
establishing a nonracial and nonsexist society based on  democratic  values,
social justice and fundamental human rights. It is through  this  Bill  that
we want to promote equality and achieve unity in our diversity.
Section 185(1) of our Constitution provides that:


  The primary objects of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of
  the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities are -


       (a)  to promote respect for the rights  of  cultural,  religious  and
           linguistic communities;


       (b)  to promote and develop peace, friendship,  humanity,   tolerance
           and national unity  among  cultural,  religious  and  linguistic
           communities, on the basis  of  equality,  nondiscrimination  and
           free association; and


       (c)  to recommend the establishment  or  recognition,  in  accordance
           with national legislation, of a cultural  or  other  council  or
           councils for a community or communities in South Africa.

I believe that these are the issues we must address when  we  speak  of  the
reconciliation and nation-building envisaged in this  Bill.  They  stand  at
the centre of the future of South Africa as the home of a stable  democracy,
human rights, equality, peace,  stability  and  a  shared  prosperity,  more
specifically for cultural, religious and linguistic communities.

Accordingly, we must attend to the question of whether, with regard  to  all
of these issues and at all times,  all  of  us  behave  in  a  manner  which
promotes the achievement of the goals as set out in our Constitution,  which
will from time to time inform the direction of this commission  towards  the
realisation  of  our  objectives  of  reconciliation  and   nation-building,
without which the kind of South Africa visualised in our  Constitution  will
most certainly not come into being.

The Bill tries to fulfil this constitutional task of playing a key  role  in
assisting with the building of a truly united South  African  nation,  bound
by a common loyalty to our country and all our people. It  is  therefore  in
the light of these prescriptions that are  contained  in  our  Constitution,
which have been translated into this piece of  legislation  that  shows  the
utmost commitment of the Government  of  South  Africa  which  we  represent
today, that we are interested in  ensuring  that,  as  people,  we  move  as
rapidly and consistently as possible towards transforming South Africa  into
a nonracial country.

We  are  interested  in  ensuring  that  our  country  lives   up   to   its
constitutional commitment  to  transforming  itself  into  a  nonsexist  and
nonracial  society  based  on  democratic   values,   social   justice   and
fundamental human rights. Therefore we support this Bill  in  its  entirety.
[Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek het  vandag  geen  begrip  vir  die  agb
Botha, dit is die een van die DP, wat hierdie  debat  misbruik  het  vir  'n
paar politieke punte wat sy probeer aanteken het nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die
enigste rede wat ek daarvoor kan sien, is dat die DP/DA polities so  bankrot
is, dat hulle emosie gebruik,  en  dat  hulle  geestesgoedere  soos  hierdie
misbruik vir eie gewin.

Die lid het vandag Afrikaans, en veeltaligheid, 'n onguns bewys, en  ek  wil
die DP versoek om hulle uit hierdie debat uit te hou  as  dít  die  vlak  is
waarop  hulle  dit  gaan  voer.  Hulle  mors   dit   op.   [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I cannot understand the hon  Botha  today,
that is the one of the DP, who has abused this debate in order  to  try  and
score a few political points. [Interjections.] The only  reason  I  can  see
for that, is that the DP/DA is politically so bankrupt that they  are  using
emotions, and abusing spiritual assets such as these for self-gain.

Today this hon member has done Afrikaans, and multilinguism,  a  disservice,
and I want to request the DP to stay out of  this  debate  if  that  is  the
level at which they are going  to  conduct  it.  They  are  messing  it  up.
[Interjections.]]

Having gone through a long process of preparation involving many  interested
persons and institutions, we can say that the Bill in  front  of  the  House
today is the best of all the drafts.

According to the preamble to the Constitution, South Africa belongs  to  all
who live in it, united in our diversity. In other words, within the  process
of nation-building our diversity is not to be ignored, but  to  be  utilised
as a building block.

In accordance with this point of departure, the  Constitution  provides  for
11 official languages in section 6 and for the right  to  use  the  language
and participate in the culture of one's choice in section 30, to  join  with
others for this purpose in section 31, to be educated  in  the  language  of
one's choice, where practicable, in section 29(2) and to  enjoy  freedom  of
religion in section 15. Traditional leaders, indigenous law and  systems  of
religious, personal and family law are recognised in sections 211,  212  and
15(3).

Provision has now also been made for a commission  to  protect  and  promote
the rights of cultural, religious and linguistic  communities  in  terms  of
sections 185 and 186. The Constitution clearly recognises our  diversity  in
these provisions and we have the  responsibility  to  give  effect  to  this
point of departure in our legislation.

When we are  engaged  in  this  legislation  establishing  the  section  185
commission, excessive restrictions on  the  commission  in  respect  of  its
powers would be inconsistent with this point of departure. As  a  matter  of
fact, the more effective the powers of the commission, the  better  it  will
be able to contribute to the integration of our diversity into  our  nation-
building efforts. The provisions of subsections 185(2) and (4) envisage  the
powers  that  will  be  conferred  on  the  commission  by   this   enabling
legislation.

The argument was advanced in the select committee  by  the  department  that
the section 185 commission is supposed to promote, rather than  to  protect,
the rights of cultural, religious and linguistic communities  and  therefore
does not require  powers  to  enforce  its  decisions.  We  agree  that  the
emphasis should be on promotion, but, apart from the fact that  one  is  not
allowed to read  the  supreme  Constitution  as  selectively  as  this,  the
argument is, in any case, based on the false assumption  that  in  order  to
promote  these  rights,  the  commission  does   not   require   powers   of
enforcement.  How  will  the  commission  be  able  to  promote  the  rights
effectively if it is unable to enforce its decisions?

It has also been alleged that such enforcement should be left to  the  Human
Rights  Commission  as  the  proper  institution  to  protect  rights.  This
argument  does  not  reflect  the  co-operative  approach  followed  in  the
Constitution. The constitution-makers intended that  the  commission  should
focus on a particular aspect of  human  rights  as  mentioned,  not  to  the
exclusion of the Human Rights Commission's work,  but  complementing  it.  I
have no doubt that the commission requires powers of  enforcement  in  order
to achieve its objectives and to strengthen our constitutional democracy.

The legitimacy of the commission will be  undermined  if  it  is  unable  to
deliver real solutions to violations of the language, cultural or  religious
rights of communities. PanSALB is a very good example of exactly  that.  The
enabling legislation may  even  be  unconstitutional  if  it  restricts  the
powers of the constitutional body. For these  reasons  it  is  essential  to
provide for effective powers for the commission.

We provided amendments which were declined on, to quote the  hon  Ralane,  a
member of the committee, `` political grounds''. I am  sure  that  something
else was meant. We also anticipated using the rules of the  NCOP  to  submit
the amendments again today, but because of  technical  reasons  it  was  not
possible.

We have tabled a private member's legislative proposal to come  into  effect
the moment this Bill becomes an Act, and we hope that  we  will  jointly  be
able to strengthen this Act before the commission starts its very  important
and reconciliatory work. We are prepared to work side by side with  the  hon
the Minister and the department to achieve this.

The people of South Africa have waited a long time for the establishment  of
this commission and we are glad to see the birth  of  this  instrument  that
will really contribute to nation-building.

Voorsitter, die geloofwaardigheid van dié kommissie  sal  bepaal  word  deur
die  mate   van   deelname   deur   die   Afrikaanse   en   ander   inheemse
taalgemeenskappe. Deelname moet van die begin af daar wees  en  daarom  moet
daar in die gees van hierdie wetgewing,  uit  die  staanspoor,  hande  gevat
word en kennis gedeel word om ons te posisioneer en voor te  berei  vir  die
deelname.

Ten slotte wil ek die  departement  bedank  vir  hulle  volgehoue  werk  aan
hierdie wetsontwerp en in die besonder vir mnr Beukman, wat  van  die  begin
af by hierdie wetsontwerp betrokke was. Ons steun hierdie wetsontwerp,  maar
met voorbehoud oor die gebrek aan  afdwingingsmag.  [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, the credibility of this commission will be determined  by  the
degree of participation by the Afrikaans  and  other  indigenous  linguistic
communities. Participation should take place from the start  and  we  should
therefore, in the spirit  of  this  legislation  and  from  the  outset,  be
holding hands and sharing knowledge  in  order  to  position  ourselves  and
prepare for this participation.

I would finally like to thank the department for  their  sustained  work  on
this Bill and in particular Mr Beukman, who has been involved in  this  Bill
from the start. We support this Bill, but with reservation  about  the  lack
of power to enforce it. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  The  next
speaker is the hon Kgoshi Mokoena. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I am humbled by this acknowledgement.

I am disappointed by the contribution of my colleague  and  friend  the  hon
Sandra Botha. She deliberately misled  this  House.  At  no  stage  did  the
Minister  of  Education  suggest  that  Afrikaans  would  be  replaced  with
English. That was just cheap politicking, I would like to say  to  her.  She
is just playing big in a very narrow  passage.  [Laughter.]  Maybe  she  was
being very economical with the truth.

All self-respecting South Africans will smile from  ear  to  ear  after  the
adoption of this Bill. It is with a sense of joy and happiness to know  that
immediately after this Bill is passed into law, communities will be able  to
practise their cultures, traditions and religions with pride.

Before I dwell on the contents of the  Bill,  I  want  to  indicate  that  I
understand and sympathise with the concerns raised by my  colleague  Mr  Van
Niekerk. It took the  committee  a  couple  of  days  of  looking  into  the
proposed amendments he is referring to. We thoroughly looked into how  could
we accommodate those amendments.

Hon members would have heard that the main concern is  that  the  commission
does not have teeth or much power. To assure my colleague,  clause  6(3)  of
this Bill gives the commission some powers to  report  directly  to  the  SA
Human  Rights  Commission  on  any  unbecoming  behaviour  by  anybody,  any
institution or any organ of state. It even recommends that action  be  taken
against anybody who tries to violate the work of the commission.

Again, I want to refer the hon member to the provision of clause 7(2)(a)  to
(e). This clause also gives the commission powers to conduct  investigations
and make recommendations so as to correct whatever needs to be corrected.

There was also the concern that the commission must  report  to  Parliament,
not to the National Assembly alone. It is our belief that any  committee  in
the NCOP is entitled to call on any Minister, any department,  any  official
or any institution to furnish it with any information  or  report.  This  is
clearly stated in the Constitution. So one does not have to fear. Again,  we
felt it would be improper for us to equate this commission with the  chapter
9 institutions. But we  fully  understand  our  colleague's  concern.  I  am
switching over to Thobela FM now. [Laughter.]

(Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, I am very thrilled  today.  If  I  had  wings,  I  would  fly,
because  I  know  that  our  African  cultures,  rights  and  languages  are
protected.

In the past there was no one, including the government,  who  protected  the
rights of black people. We were even scared to talk in  our  own  languages,
because people would laugh at us. This Bill establishes  a  commission  that
will protect, enhance and promote our African languages and cultures.

It will also help ensure that our cultures are not  disrespected.  In  other
parts of the world, people are not shy to perform  their  cultural  rituals.
So, why is it that we are shy to  do  the  same?  South  Africans,  who  has
bewitched us?]

People are even ashamed to perform some rituals  in  the  belief  that  they
will be seen  as  people  who  are  not  civilised.  This  is  the  time  to
decolonise our minds. [Laughter.] Some people  even  go  to  the  extent  of
changing their African names.

Let me give hon members an example. We have the African name  ``Matome''.  A
person will change that into ``Mouton''. [Laughter.] There is also the  name
``Makgona'' - it will  be  changed  to  ``Morgan''.  An  African  name  like
``Phathekile'' is changed to ``Particle''. [Laughter.] I  am  now  switching
over to Radio Munghana Lonene.

If you were Risimati, they would change your name and  call  you  Raizemate.
If your name was Phakade, they had to change it and  call  you  Parcade.  If
you were John Tate, they would convert it and call you John Tait.]
I am changing back to Thobela FM.

[Chairperson, we should be proud of our diverse cultures and languages.  Let
me not start praising, because you will think that  you  have  honey.  These
are the things which traditional doctors say when they throw up their  bones
in order to diagnose problems.]

How many of us in this Chamber are still communicating with our kids in  our
mother tongue? [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES (Mr M J Bhengu): Order! I  can  say  to
the hon Kgoshi that that is the price one has to pay to be free,  the  price
of being colonised. So one has to be decolonised.

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,
firstly, I would like to thank all the  members  who  participated  in  this
debate. I am especially impressed by the hon Kgoshi Mokoena  who  got  me  a
bit bamboozled because, while listening to one language, he changed over  to
another. My earpiece was not functioning and I did  not  hear  some  of  the
things that he said.

So this has taught me that I should make a point  of  learning  all  the  11
official languages, plus two. [Interjections.] Yes, sign  language  and  the
indigenous language of the Khoi and the San.

When I visited the Northern Cape I could hardly pronounce the  name  of  the
district municipality and I still cannot - Xe Xa ... [Laughter.]  Those  are
the difficulties, and I am saying this because I am over  50  years  old,  I
have been in this country for  more  than  50  years  now  and  I  am  still
learning.
For a young democracy which is less than 10 years old, the hon Sandra  Botha
really cannot expect that we would be that advanced. This is a  process.  We
have our ups and downs, our  difficulties,  and  the  hon  Sandra  Botha  is
invited, as I have already said in my speech, to play a role in making  this
a reality. However, I welcome the support of the DP for this Bill.

The hon Mkhaliphi touched on the  point  of  nation-building.  I  appreciate
that. I so wish that we could all keep that at the back of  our  mind  every
time we speak. Every time we have these debates we should keep in mind  that
we ensure that whatever we say and do contributes to nation-building.

Yes, every one of these languages is very important,  as  are  our  cultures
and our religions. We are hoping that the  commission  is  going  to  ensure
that all these issues are brought to the conferences where every one  of  us
will have an opportunity to put forward our views.

The hon Van Niekerk raised an issue which I understand was  also  raised  in
the deliberations in the committee. It is the issue of  giving  more  powers
to the commission. I think it is important to note that the  commission  has
been given wide powers. I thank the hon Kgoshi for explaining  this  to  the
House, and I am not going into that because he has  already  explained.  The
commission is not restricted from doing  all  the  things  that  the  Kgoshi
raised. I think the important thing is for  all  the  constitutional  bodies
that we have established  in  terms  of  the  Constitution,  the  Chapter  9
institutions, for example, actually to work together to achieve the  broader
objective,  which  is  the  creation  of  a  nonracial,  nonsexist,  united,
democratic society.

I am not sure why we want to emphasise the point of  the  extra  power  that
this commission has to be given. I feel that the  powers  that  are  in  the
Bill are sufficient to get us started. We will await  the  private  member's
Bill which the hon Van Niekerk referred to and again we  will  sit  in  this
House and debate that.
I thank all hon members very much for supporting the Bill so that we can  go
ahead and give the commission an opportunity to start its work. I also  hope
that every one of us will support the commission. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 19:50.
