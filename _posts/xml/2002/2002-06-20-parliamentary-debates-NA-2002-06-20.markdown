                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs B M NTULI: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  etv screened matches of the World Cup in  Korea/Japan  in  which
           Bafana Bafana participated;


       (b)  etv has also screened the one day international matches  between
           Australia and South Africa; and


       (c)  in doing so, etv  has  made  these  national  and  international
           events available to the people of South Africa,  especially  the
           historically disadvantaged communities; and


  (2)  wishes  to  congratulate  etv  for  making  these  historic   sports
       activities accessible to the majority of our people.

[Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice on behalf of the DP  that  I
shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the New NP had 1 713 town and city councillors  after  the
       first local government elections in 1995-96;


  (2) notes further that in the year 2000 the New NP nominated 597  out  of
       the 1 370 DA councillors; and


  (3) now looks forward to learning how many of those 597  councillors  the
       New NP can persuade to rejoin them.

Ms I MARS: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its appreciation of the recently published draft report  of
       the committee of  inquiry  into  a  comprehensive  system  of  social
       security for South Africa;


  (2) acknowledges the extensive work done by Professor Vivian Taylor,  her
       committee and members of Parliament;


  (3) accepts that there is evidence  of  sufficient  fiscal  capacity  for
       improved social sector spending;


  (4) asks for speedy action to ease the plight of many thousands of  South
       Africans still in dire need of support; and


  (5)  suggests  that  the  implementation  of  a  basic  income  grant  be
       considered now.

Mong L J MODISENYANE: Ke tla sisinya lebitsong la ANC:


  Ho re -


  (1) Ntlo e lemohe ketso  ya  bokgabane  e  entsweng  ke  motjha  wa  mane
       Bethlehem wa Freistata, e leng ho pholosa bophelo ba  leseyanyana  le

(Translation of Sotho notice of motion follows.)

[Mr L J MODISENYANE: Chairman, I shall move on behalf  of  the  ANC  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the good deed performed by a young  man  from  Bethlehem,  Free
       State, in saving the life of a newly born baby that had  been  thrown
       into a stinking toilet pit by its mother;


  (2) condemns this cruel deed that belies the saying: It is the mother who
       holds the sharp end of the knife;


  (3) commends the police officer who displayed a love that surpassed  that
       of the mother;


  (4) says: Long live Mr Willem van Niekerk! People  like  you  are  sorely
       needed in the Police Service; and


  (5) says to the mother: Shame on you!]

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move  on  behalf
of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the results of the latest Markinor and Markdata opinion  polls,
       which clearly indicate that -


       (a)  the New NP's support is growing at a sharp upward  curve,  while
           the DA's support is currently half of what it was 18 months  ago
           in the local government elections; and


       (b)  the New NP's core power base  has  been  consolidated,  and  the
           party is in fact stronger than before the DA's  formation,  with
           remarkable growth potential;


  (2) also notes that Markinor's poll was done two  months  ago,  therefore
       the impact of the Morkel/Harksen scandal and the  DA's  and  the  hon
       Leon's clumsy handling thereof has not even been taken into  account;
       and


  (3) believes this serves as confirmation that voters  are  tired  of  the
       DP/DA's approach of criticising for the sake of criticising  and  are
       opting for the New NP's more constructive approach.

[Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the UDM  at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the unfolding rescue efforts by the SA Agulhas, in  an  attempt
       to rescue the 107 people aboard the Magdalena Oldendorff,  which  has
       been trapped in the ice of Antarctica;


  (2) further notes the  assistance  to  be  rendered  by  the  Argentinian
       icebreaker, which has set sail from Buenos Aires; and


  (3) expresses its best wishes to the crews of both the  rescue  ships  in
       their rescue operations, and awaits their safe return.

Dr I M CACHALIA: Mr Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the President of the Republic of South Africa  said,  ``no
       one has the right to call for the killing of farmers  or  boers,  nor
       the right to threaten violence to advance their goals'' in his budget
       speech on Wednesday;


  (2) further notes that the President said that he  was  proud  that  many
       farmers were lending a hand to create a better life for all,  and  by
       being ``proudly African'';


  (3) believes that the statements made by President  Thabo  Mbeki  reflect
       the commitment of the ANC-led Government to build national unity  and
       protect the rights of all South African citizens; and


  (4) welcomes the statements made by the President during his Budget  Vote
       speech on Wednesday, 19 June 2002.

[Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek  kennis  dat  ek  namens
die VF by die volgende sitting van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die VF president Mbeki se onvoorwaardelike veroordeling van  die
           gebruik van die slagspreuk ``Kill the boer, kill the farmer'' by
           twee onlangse byeenkomste, waardeur hy duidelike leiding aan  sy
           ondersteuners en alle Suid-Afrikaners gegee het, verwelkom;


       (b)  beide voorvalle deur die VF in 'n baie ernstige lig beskou  word
           aangesien dit na ons mening 'n oortreding van  artikel  16(2)(c)
           van die Grondwet van Suid-Afrika, wat oor haatspraak handel, is;
           en


       (c)  die VF Dinsdag 'n amptelike klag by die Menseregtekommissie  oor
           die haatspraak-slagspreuk ``Kill the  boer,  kill  the  farmer''
           ingedien het; en


  (2) sy hoop uitspreek dat  die  Menseregtekommissie  president  Mbeki  se
       voorbeeld sal volg, en sal bevind dat  hierdie  slagspreuk  inderdaad
       haatspraak is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER:  Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the  Freedom  Front  welcomes  President  Mbeki's  unconditional
           condemnation of the use of the slogan ``Kill the Boer, kill  the
           farmer'' at two recent (ANC) gatherings, through which  he  gave
           clear leadership to his supporters and all South Africans;


       (b)  both incidents are viewed in a very serious light by the FF,  as
           they  constitute  a  violation  of  section  16(2)(c)   of   the
           Constitution of South Africa; and


       (c)  on Tuesday the FF laid an  official  complaint  with  the  Human
           Rights Commission about the hate speech slogan ``Kill the  Boer,
           kill  the  farmer''  which  was  recently  chanted  at  two  ANC
           gatherings; and


  (2) expresses the hope that  the  Human  Rights  Commission  will  follow
       President Mbeki's example and will find that this  slogan  is  indeed
       hate speech.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the MF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  water is a basic right, not a privilege;


       (b)  it is a known fact that a human being can survive without  food,
           but cannot survive without water for more than a few days;


       (c)  it is also known that the earth is made up of 75% water;


       (d)  inflation and the high cost of  living  make  day-to-day  living
           hard and almost impossible for the majority  of  our  population
           that is poverty-stricken; and


       (e)  taxes and tariffs need to be paid;


  (2) recognises that increasing  water  tariffs  at  impossible  rates  is
       unacceptable;


  (3) wonders whether we are trying to kill  our  people  by  making  water
       almost not accessible; and


  (4) resolves that unicity water tariffs receive urgent  consideration  in
       view of the well-being of our people.

Mev M P COETZEE-KASPER: Mnr die Voorsitter, hiermee gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek
namens die ANC by die volgende sitting van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met dankbaarheid kennis neem van 'n 36,3%-afname in plaasaanvalle  in
       die Vrystaat vanaf 2001-02;


  (2) met waardering kennis neem  dat  dit  toegeskryf  kan  word  aan  die
       verbeterde en nouer samewerking tussen die SAPD en die kommandos  wat
       die plattelandse veiligheidsplan opgestel het;


  (3) ook daarvan kennis neem dat die noue samewerking tussen plaaseienaars
       en plaaswerkers 'n onontbeerlike deel is van hierdie sukses; en


  (4) hoop waaksaamheid en stappe om die euwel  van  plaasaanvalle  uit  te
       roei, nooit verslap sal word nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice  that  at  the
next sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with gratitude a 36,3% reduction in farm attacks  in  the  Free
       State from 2001-2002;


  (2) notes with appreciation that this can be attributed to  the  improved
       and close co-operation between the SAPS and the commandos  which  set
       up the rural safety plan;


  (3) also notes that  the  close  co-operation  between  farm  owners  and
       farmworkers is an indispensable part of this success; and


  (4) hopes that vigilance and steps to eradicate the evil of farm  attacks
       will never be relaxed.]

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Chairperson, I shall move at  the  next  sitting  of
this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that in a by-election  in  Graaff-Reinet,  an  ANC  stronghold,
       yesterday the DA increased its support from 14% in 2000  to  26%  and
       that this  included  an  increase  in  the  largely  coloured  voting
       district from 38% to 59%, and that the support in  the  black  voting
       district nearly doubled;


  (2) also notes that -


       (a)  for the New  NP  to  claim  victory  in  Kimberley  because  the
           election was won by the ANC is utterly laughable, while the  New
           NP is yet to contest a by-election, and thus  test  the  support
           for their disastrous co-operation  with  the  ANC,  the  DA  has
           contested 21 by-elections since the New NP  leadership  withdrew
           from DA; and


       (b)  by latching on to one by-election in which they were too  afraid
           even to put up a candidate, the New NP is  revealing  its  utter
           desperation; and


  (3) calls on the New NP to have the courage to test  their  support  with
       the people by contesting a by-election against the DA.

[Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, I give notice  that  at  the  next  sitting  I
shall move as follows:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the continued difficulty provinces are  having  filling  medical
           posts in rural areas;


       (b)  the Department of Health's arbitrary  and  restrictive  approach
           towards registering foreign qualified doctors; and


       (c)   the  department's  preference  for  government  to   government
           agreement with Cuban doctors or South African doctors trained in
           Cuba; and


  (2) calls on the Minister of Health to adopt -


       (a)  an incentive-driven programme for medical students; and


       (b)  a more  inclusive  approach  to  qualified  doctors  from  other
           countries, so that enthusiastic doctors from  Ireland,  Britain,
           Europe, the  USA,  Eastern  and  Middle  Eastern  countries  and
           African countries are encouraged to work in our rural areas.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Chairperson, I give notice that on the  next  sitting  day  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Thabo Mbeki said that  more  than  80 000  South
       Africans volunteered to eradicate poverty by assisting the elderly to
       secure their social grants, in the budget speech  of  the  Presidency
       last Tuesday;


  (2) believes  that  the  overwhelming  response  by  our  people  to  the
       President's call for Vukuzenzele reflects their commitment to build a
       better life for all and to work to unite the nation; and


  (3) congratulates all those citizens that volunteered to assist  citizens
       eligible for social grants to register.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Mr Chair, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day  of  the
House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the controversy surrounding the two health MECs for  Mpumalanga
       and the Eastern Cape;
  (2) also notes that -


       (a)  Dr Thys von Mollendorff was fired last year by  the  health  MEC
           for Mpumalanga for allowing Grip to operate in one of the  rooms
           in the Rob Ferreira Hospital;


       (b)  he lost the appeal against his dismissal because  he  was  never
           informed about the date of the hearing and thus was never  given
           a chance to defend himself;


       (c)  Dr Frederick Rank was fired by the health MEC  for  the  Eastern
           Cape for speaking to the media about the dire  state  of  health
           services in the Nelson Mandela Metropole; and


       (d)  other doctors and the previous health MEC have come out  in  his
           support; and


  (3) welcomes President  Mbeki's  statement  that  he  intends  addressing
       problems  of  maladministration  and   incompetence   in   provincial
       governments and calls on him to start with the health departments  of
       Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape.

[Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting  day
I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  according to the Banking Council  low  income  earners  who  owe
           money and apply to court for administration orders often end  up
           in a position where they are  unable  to  ever  pay  back  their
           debts;


       (b)  it is especially low  income  earners  that  have  been  granted
           considerable amounts in credit extensions  over  the  past  five
           years; and
       (c)  in many instances the administrators act in contravention of the
           Magistrates Courts Act by charging more than the  allowed  12,5%
           and often paying creditors less than the agreed amount; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of Safety and Security to urgently  investigate
       the contraventions of the Magistrates' Courts  Act,  to  protect  the
       poor and promote economic upliftment in South Africa.

                              WORLD REFUGEE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that today, 20 June 2002, is World Refugee Day;


  (2) recognises that 2002 marks the 51st anniversary of  the  adoption  of
       the  1951  United  Nations  Convention  Relating  to  the  Status  of
       Refugees, which together with its 1967 Protocol are the most  broadly
       accepted  foundation  instruments  of  the  international  protection
       regime;


  (3) notes with alarm the expanding number of refugees  around  the  world
       and their terrible plight; and


  (4)  affirms  its  continued  commitment  to  addressing  the  plight  of
       refugees.

[Applause.]

Agreed to.

                        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE:  Chairperson,  the  Taxation  Laws  Amendment  Bill
deals  primarily  with  the  incorporation  into  legislation  of  the   tax
proposals announced on Budget day this year. The  Bill  proposes  amendments
to a variety of taxation laws, personal income tax,  interest  and  dividend
exemption,  learnership  allowances,  stimulatory  measures   for   business
including small  business  corporations  and  accelerated  depreciation  for
manufacturing assets.

The Bill also introduces changes which limit  the  deductions  of  employees
and deals with  other  relief  including  transfer  duty,  estate  duty  and
donations  tax,  transactions  taxes  and  changes  to   various   exemption
thresholds. This Bill also introduces significant changes in respect of  the
taxation of public benefit organisations.

The Bill has been discussed quite extensively in the Portfolio Committee  on
Finance and I have pleasure in tabling the Taxation Laws Amendment  Bill  of
2002. [Applause.]

Bill, together with the introductory speech, referred for consideration  and
report to the Portfolio Committee on Finance.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                (Decision of Question on Votes and Schedule)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members,  the  noise  levels  are
rather high. Since we are doing important  business,  could  we  please  cut
down on the number of private conversations.

Before we commence, I wish to thank parties for advising the staff on  which
Votes they will be making declarations and  on  which  Votes  they  will  be
recording their objections, as well as those they will be dividing on.  This
information will greatly assist the process this afternoon.

I will put each Vote and ask parties for declarations of vote as  they  have
indicated. After this, I will put the Vote for decision. The bells  will  be
rung for three minutes for the first division on a  Vote  but  for  only  15
seconds on subsequent divisions.

Vote No 1 - The Presidency - put.

Declarations of vote:

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION:  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  have  called  for  a
division on this Vote if it were not for the fact ...  [Interjections.]  The
Minister for Intelligence says it does not matter. She is no democrat,  that
is for sure. I would have called for a division if it were not for the  fact
that I hear it is the birthday of the Minister in the  Presidency  tomorrow,
and obviously one must have some regard for the  fact  that  there  are  two
birthdays in the Presidency this week.

But that does not lessen one's objection to  the  Presidency  in  the  sense
that more and more power has been accumulated in  this  Presidency  than  at
any time in the immediate past history of South Africa, and for little  very
purpose.

It is all very well  for  the  President  to  occasionally  bypass  or  pass
through Parliament, make a few remarks and ignore  a  significant  slice  of
the debate. This is one thing and it is not democratic.  But  another  thing
is to ignore the people of  South  Africa,  to  ignore  the  sick  of  South
Africa, South Africans dying of Aids, two  million  South  Africans  in  the
unemployment queues, South Africans who are not sure where their  next  meal
is coming from and South Africans who are  refused  a  basic  income  grant.
Those are the people that the Presidency ignores in South  Africa.  The  day
of reckoning is coming to this country  and  it  will  not  be  between  the
opposition and the Government but between the people  of  South  Africa  and
the Government of South Africa. [Interjections.]

The ANC can put as much power as it likes into the Presidency  and  pass  as
much anti-investment legislation as it wishes to pass, such  as  the  latest
minerals Bill, which is being railroaded through a  parliamentary  committee
as we speak. That Bill is a red light for investors in this country. But  at
the end of the day, they must go to the people and explain why  it  is  that
millions  of  South  Africans  are  needlessly  dying  in  this  country  of
HIV/Aids, while, if  we  had  had  a  better  approach  towards  labour  and
investment,   millions   of   South   Africans   could   have   had    jobs.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

The LEADER  OF  THE  OPPOSITION:  Those  are  the  questions  that  must  be
answered. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr  G  C  OOSTHUIZEN:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  ek  wil,  in  die  woorde  van
Langenhoven vir die agb Leon sê: Al verdien 'n man dit nie, eer  hom  na  sy
posisie. Dit is al genoeg dat hy die posisie oneer aandoen. As  'n  mens  na
die agb  Leon  luister,  dan  wil  hy  nie  ernstig  wees  oor  nasiebou  en
versoening in die land nie. [Mr Chairman, in the  words  of  Langenhoven,  I
want to say to the hon Leon: Even if a man does not deserve it,  honour  him
according to his position. It is sufficient  that  he  is  dishonouring  the
position.When one listens to the hon Leon, he does not want  to  be  serious
about nation-building and reconciliation in the country.]

They cannot be taken seriously if they oppose the efforts of the  Presidency
in this country to  get  the  economically  marginalised  onto  the  playing
field, thereby creating a  better  life  for  all.  Despite  his  continuous
stream of protest, we in the ANC will continue to push  back  the  frontiers
of poverty in our country and continent. [Applause.]

How patriotic is he if he opposes  the  President  when  he  says  that  the
Leader of the Opposition and I are as much Africans as he  is  one?  The  DA
leadership's  self-inflicted  paranoia  has   isolated   them   from   their
supporters. May I say that their supporters want to be on  the  train.  They
do not want to be left on the platform while the train is  departing  for  a
better and brighter future. [Applause.]

The time for introspection for the DA has come. If they want to be  part  of
the solutions in this country, then  they  will  earn  the  respect  of  the
President. They cannot demand respect. Respect is earned, not inherited.  We
support this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to (Democratic Party and Federal Alliance dissenting).

Decision of Question interrupted.

                       CROSSING-THE-FLOOR LEGISLATION

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I apologise for  interrupting  the  debate.
We will resume immediately. But there is a  brief  announcement  that  I  do
need to make to the House as soon as possible so that members  do  not  have
to read about it in the media.

I have to announce that the President of the Republic has  assented  to  the
four Bills dealing with crossing the floor. The Acts  are  to  appear  in  a
special Gazette published today. The  15-day  window  period,  during  which
members may cross the floor without losing  their  seats  and  during  which
parties may merge  or  subdivide,  therefore  commences  at  00:01  tonight.
[Applause.]

It looks as if I did not have to apologise  for  interrupting,  but  let  me
proceed. The 15-day period runs from 21 June to  midnight  on  5  July.  Any
member or party wishing to make any change during this window period  should
complete a special form which is being prepared for this  purpose  and  will
be available in about an hour's  time  to  all  parties.  Please  note  that
parties are asking for more than 400 copies of the form. You  will  get  400
if you want them. There are no other members of the House.

The form, which will be the only valid form, will be made available  to  all
members. Members and parties should note that for purposes of informing  the
Speaker of any intended changes, they should submit the completed  forms  to
any one of the following designated parliamentary officials:  the  Secretary
to the National  Assembly,  Mr  Hahndiek,  and  the  Undersecretary  to  the
National  Assembly,  Dr  Ismail.  The  form  will  include  covering   notes
containing details which members and parties will need  to  comply  with  in
order for the change to be valid.

When  the  window  period  expires,  the  Speaker  will,  in  terms  of  the
legislation, publish details of the  altered  composition  of  the  National
Assembly. The form does contain the details again including times  when  you
may deposit them, and you will be  required  to  deposit  forms  personally.
[Interjections.] Well, starting from midnight.

Having advised you of that information, I can  now  allow  you  to  continue
with whatever I interrupted. [Interjections.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

         (Resumption of Decision of Question on Votes and Schedule)

Vote No 2 - Parliament - put.

Declarations of vote:

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, we support the Budget Vote  of  the  Speaker,
but I would like to say the following. We  echo  the  sentiments  which  the
Speaker expressed during her address in the debate,  namely  that  the  time
allocated to the minority parties is not sufficient for a meaningful  debate
to ensue in the House.

The practice of  allocating  time  for  debates  according  to  the  current
proportional  system  is  flawed.  This  practice  undermines  the  role  of
parliamentary oversight as the members of the ruling party are  unlikely  to
raise critical issues against their  own,  in  view  of  the  principles  of
loyalty and discipline.

We would also note that the international practice, for example  in  Sweden,
is to allocate more time to the opposition in order to give  effect  to  the
principle  of  parliamentary  oversight.  [Interjections.]  Time  allocation
should be decided by a neutral arbiter, for example the presiding  officers.
It should not be allowed to be a political issue.

This  practice  runs  contrary   to   the   constitutional   principles   of
representativity and inclusivity. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Mr Chairperson, the IFP will  not  be  opposing  this  Vote.
However, we do believe that the time has come for  sufficient  funds  to  be
injected into the parliamentary budget. The time has  come  when  Parliament
should be empowered to deal with the matters at hand.  Until  that  happens,
we are not going to get any further.

We believe that things have not been  the  way  they  should  be,  that  the
administration is not up to scratch and that the only way that we  are  ever
going to get to where we need to be in this Parliament is to see to it  that
sufficient funds are injected into the parliamentary budget.

It is insufficient to accept that we have  just  had  an  individual  annual
increase based on the previous year's  budget.  The  time  has  come  to  do
something dramatic and  bring  about  the  right  kind  of  change  and  the
transformation that is needed in this Parliament.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, we want to echo  some  of
the sentiments expressed by the  hon  member  from  the  IFP.  Indeed,  this
Budget Vote has  to  be  supported,  particularly  because  we  do  need  to
endeavour to make it work by increasing capacity at the level of  committees
and of all the other operational aspects of  Parliament.  The  ANC  supports
this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr C W EGLIN: Mr Chairman, the DP will support this  Budget  Vote.  We  were
impressed by the commitment of the personnel,  who,  under  great  pressure,
carried out their duties. However, there are matters for concern. Morale  is
not as good as it should  be.  The  capacity  of  the  department  is  being
stretched beyond its limits. The budget has not been increased in line  with
South Africa's growing international responsibilities.

There is  lack  of  effective  corporate  management.  Changes  in  the  top
management positions have been too  frequent.  Too  many  senior  management
positions are held on acting basis. There is uncertainty  on  the  structure
of the department and of its relationship with the Presidency. It  is  clear
that the Cabinet must undertake an  in-depth  study  of  the  scope  of  the
department,  its  structure,  its  essential  budget  and   its   functional
relationship with the Presidency.

In this coming year new demands will be imposed on the Government  and  this
department. As the chair of the AU, South Africa will have  to  play  a  key
role in launching Nepad, in  converting  Nepad  from  a  plan  on  paper  to
concrete action and in developing  Nepad  from  a  good  intention  into  an
effective instrument of delivery.
Nepad will be assisted in attaining these objectives by a positive  response
from the developed nations. However, Nepad's success will  depend  on,  more
than anything else, the extent to which  African  governments  fulfil  their
commitments to democracy,  sound  economic  policies  and  good  government,
embracing human rights and respect for the rule of law.

Because of this, we in the  DP  say  to  our  Government  there  can  be  no
compromise on  these  fundamental  Nepad  values.  There  can  be  no  back-
pedalling because of past favours, no softening  because  of  a  search  for
some spurious solidarity. We say to the Government that we  expect  them  to
stand firm in the defence and promotion of these core principles  which  lie
at the heart of Nepad. We say to Government that when it does  so,  it  will
certainly have the  support  of  the  DP  and  of  the  enlarged  Democratic
Alliance which will emerge tomorrow. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, the ACDP supports this budget  but  would  like
to highlight the following things.  Firstly,  I  must  echo  what  the  last
speaker said with regard to  the  department,  that  there  needs  to  be  a
filling of vacancies which are still unfilled in that department.

With regard to Nepad, I am happy to  have  heard  what  the  President  said
during his  debate  in  the  Presidency,  namely  that  a  budget  has  been
allocated to support Nepad. This is what we  want  to  see,  but  even  more
important is the involvement of civil society.  We  need  to  put  in  place
concrete  measures  to  involve  civil  society  in  the  Nepad   programme.
Otherwise, we support the Budget Vote.

Dr Z P JORDAN: Mr Chairperson, since 1994, South Africa has won a  respected
place in the international community, as  is  evidenced  by  the  number  of
international conferences we have hosted since  that  time,  beginning  with
the Nonaligned Movement conference and  followed  by  the  World  Conference
Against Racism and this year the founding conference of the AU and also  the
World Summit on Sustainable Development. This is all  due  to  the  sterling
efforts of our Department of Foreign Affairs, led very ably by our  Minister
of Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Minister.

Notwithstanding the many problems  that  exist  in  that  department,  which
include a rather parsimonious budget, in  our  view,  we  think  this  is  a
department that has  acquitted  itself  well.  Therefore  we  very  strongly
support this Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 4 - Home Affairs - put.

Declarations of vote:

Prince N E ZULU: Chairperson, in supporting the  Home  Affairs  Budget  Vote
one has to note that underfunding in this  department  over  the  years  has
failed it in projecting itself as the underbelly and face of the country  to
its citizens and foreigners alike.

This year's budget increase has also not been  an  increase  to  write  home
about, as it still fails to fill the vacant posts that have been  there  for
a long period of time, thus failing the department as it sets out to  render
the world-class service  enshrined  in  its  mission  statement.  It  is  an
increase to keep the department going  despite  the  stress  and  strain  on
those in service demanding more and more of their sweat and tears. It  is  a
budget increase that offers no hope but more questions than answers.

The present version of the Immigration Act is another futile exercise in  an
attempt to improve the lives of Home  Affairs  customers.  As  long  as  the
Immigration Act fails to attract the greatest number of skilled  foreigners,
it will have failed its mission, and urgent amendments will be necessary  in
order to bring it to its original form. Again,  if  it  fails  to  curb  the
alarming brain drain to Europe and elsewhere, that will  be  disastrous  for
South Africa's economy in the not distant future.

Mr S N  SWART:  Mr  Chairman,  the  ACDP  will  support  this  Budget  Vote,
notwithstanding our great concern at the fact  that  the  department  is  to
receive R300 million less than requested and that the  nearly  R120  million
underfunding cited has been identified as ``critical to service  delivery''.
We have identified that the major problem, which  the  department  has  also
identified,  continues  to  be  an  insufficient  budgetary  allocation  for
personnel.

The department has to date been  functioning  with  a  fixed  establishment,
approved by the office of the Public Service Commission during  1995,  which
comprises 6 982 posts. Of this establishment  only  6 200  are  filled  and,
since the rationalisation of the Public Service  in  1994,  the  demand  for
services has increased dramatically.  This  has  resulted  in  a  tremendous
challenge for the department to utilise as far  as  possible  all  available
resources.

The shoddy manner in which the hon the Minister of Home Affairs was  treated
during the Immigration Bill proceedings cannot be overlooked by this  House.
It is indisputable that this Parliament owes him  an  apology.  How  was  it
possible that we allowed a Bill to be tabled which was profoundly  different
from the Government's policies and the terms of the  debate  on  immigration
control during the past seven years? How  is  it  possible  that  a  revised
version of the Bill was only informally presented to the Minister  48  hours
prior to his debate on the Bill? In his words at the time he said:


  Up until 48 hours ago, our Government  maintained  and  declared  to  the
  world a policy based on tenets which have now been subverted.

Notwithstanding this, the ACDP will support this Budget Vote.

Mr M I SCOTT:  Chairperson,  the  ANC  believes  that  it  is  important  to
continue to contribute towards the best world-class service to  our  people,
and the Department of Home Affairs has an important role  to  play  in  this
regard. We accept that it is going to be a process  to  actively  deal  with
challenges facing the department. Those challenges  are  the  implementation
of  the  Hanis  project,  the  population  register,  the  rolling  out   of
infrastructure   in   order   to   make   Home   Affairs   accessible,   the
computerisation of  offices,  managed  migration,  corruption  and  the  new
electoral system. I think it is important that we should also intensify  the
registration and the ID campaign, particularly in the rural areas,  so  that
we can make the services of the Government accessible.

We should also note that some of the comments that have come  from  some  of
the parties are really misplaced. I agree with the Minister of Home  Affairs
when he said in the Budget Debate last week and also at the dinner party  on
the same day that the Immigration Act was quite an improved  product.  I  do
not know what those other members are talking about when they  speak  as  if
it is something that was misplaced. It is  true  that  there  are  technical
problems related to that Bill,  but  those  are  issues  that  we  have  all
committed ourselves to addressing within a period of two to three months.  I
do not think that they defeat the purpose of the  Bill  itself.  It  was  an
improved product and we will continue to improve it.
We are also  mindful  of  the  fact  that  the  issues  of  immigration  are
contentious issues. Even in the European Union, where they have  established
systems, it is still a big problem. That is why on  the  21st  and  22nd  of
this month they are going to be looking at these issues, and  here  in  this
country we will continue  to  address  them.  The  ANC  supports  this  Home
Affairs Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mrs  R  M  SOUTHGATE:  Mr  Chairperson,  the  imminent  crossing-the   floor
legislation  will  only  serve   to   further   exacerbate   the   financial
difficulties experienced by the municipalities. Currently, local  government
debt is already estimated at R22 billion. Whilst we should  be  focusing  on
improving service delivery and reducing our debt, we  are  preoccupied  with
passing legislation which is nothing but opportunistic  and  set  on  taking
control.

National Government must take responsibility for the potential  increase  in
tension  in  local  government  given  the  recent  spate  of   attacks   on
councillors from different parties as  a  result  of  party  allegiance  and
affiliation.

The ANC and New NP argue that  the  new  legislation  will  stabilise  local
government, and the ACDP says no, we are of the opinion that it will do  the
opposite and further retard effective and efficient  service  delivery.  Our
communities are currently deeply divided and despondent  and  feel  betrayed
by politicians. It is our view that the implementation of the  crossing-the-
floor legislation is not conducive to bringing together our communities  and
restoring confidence in Government.

We are convinced that this legislation was considered  for  the  purpose  of
political expedience and with indecent haste  without  taking  into  account
the financial implications it  will  have  for  local  government  councils,
given the restructuring that will have to  take  place,  especially  in  the
Western  Cape,  where  there  is  a  strong  possibility  that  the  current
executive system will be replaced by the executive mayoral system, which  is
clearly not the wish of the voters.

The only way to resolve this once and for all is to test the voters  in  the
Western Cape, and we call for fresh elections. The  ACDP  does  not  support
this Vote.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Voorsitter, as ons kyk na plaaslike  regering,  dan  het
die VF het die VF  geen  ander  keuse  as  om  te  sê  dat  hy  nie  hierdie
begrotingspos gaan steun nie. Die  uitstaande  skulde  aan  dienstegelde  in
hierdie stadium  is  meer  as  R23  miljard.  Dit  is  meer  as  die  totale
verdedigingsbegroting van Suid-Afrika. Ek  wil  vir  die  agb  Minister  van
Finansies sê hy moet met sy kollega daar langs hom gaan praat,  en  dan  sal
hy beter prioriteite kan bepaal om sy sentrale fondse anders aan te wend.

Daar is nie behoorlike finansiële bestuur by plaaslike regering nie.  Solank
daar nie behoorlike finansiële bestuur is nie, solank  die  ANC  in  gebreke
bly om die kultuur van betaling weer te begin skep - hulle het  die  kultuur
geskep om nie te betaal nie - kan die VF  nie  hierdie  begrotingspos  steun
nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, if we look at local  government,  then  the
FF has no choice but to say that it would not be supporting this  Vote.  The
outstanding debts in service charges at this stage amount to more  than  R23
billion. That is more than the total Defence budget of South Africa. I  want
to say to the hon the Minister of Finance that he should go and talk to  his
colleague next to him,  for  then  he  will  be  able  to  determine  better
priorities to utilise his central funds in another way.

There is no proper financial management in local government. For as long  as
there is no proper financial management, for as long as  the  ANC  fails  to
start recreating the culture of payment - they created the culture  of  non-
payment - the FF cannot support this Vote. [Interjections.]]

Mr Y I CARRIM:  Chairperson,  there  is  a  34,8%  increase  in  the  budget
allocated to the department, an 18,3% increase to local government over  the
MTEF period, a  71%  increase  in  funds  for  municipal  infrastructure,  a
strategic plan increasingly aligned to the budget and providing a  framework
for the restructuring of the department, and, what is more, a commitment  to
linking the department's programmes to the broader goals  of  Government  on
economic growth, job creation and redistribution.

In  general  terms,  what  more  can  one  reasonably   ask   for   in   the
circumstances? True, there are problems; how could  there  not  be?  But  to
oppose the budget is unfathomable and unpardonable. It  is  mere  opposition
for opposition's sake and, frankly, very, very boring. If Mr Groenewald  had
bothered to come to a single meeting this year, or in fact,  ever  since  he
came to this Parliament, he would know that the budget  addresses  precisely
some of the issues he points out as  his  reasons  for  having  difficulties
with municipalities. He does not know, needless to say,  that  there  are  a
whole number of grants  directed  to  ensuring  that  municipalities  manage
their finances better. Of course, he does not know  either,  since  he  does
not come to any  meeting,  that  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance
Management Bill, currently before this Parliament, seeks  to  address  that.
[Interjections.] I cannot work out either, mind you, what the  relevance  is
of what Rhoda Southgate has to say to a Budget Vote debate.

But I shall say that, in fact, in this past year some 55% of  our  people  -
note, 55% - have been  receiving  free  basic  water  services.  [Applause.]
There are some 10 pilot projects already under way to provide, as  difficult
as it is, free basic electricity. [Applause.] The  Minister  also  declared,
only a week or two ago, that the major issue of traditional  leadership  and
institutions was going to be dealt  with  very  shortly.  In  fact,  he  has
invited traditional leaders and other  stakeholders  to  take  part  in  the
White Paper process that is pending.

Might I also mention  that  the  ISRDP,  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
Development Programme - Mr Groenewald will not know that  -  and  the  Urban
Renewal Programme - he will not know that either, needless  to  say  -  have
had over 120 projects launched worth R3,7 billion this past year  and  there
are a further 122 projects.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr Y I CARRIM: I wish I had half a minute more to convince him, but  I  will
leave it at that. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to (African Christian Democratic  Party,  Democratic  Party  and
Freedom Front dissenting).

Vote No 6 - Public Works - put.

Declarations of vote:
Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson,  we  support  the  budget  of  the  department.
However, I would like  to  declare  one  issue.  Fortunately,  the  Minister
addressed it this week when she said, with regard to the problems of  lease,
that a plan had been put in place to  ensure  that  only  senior  authorised
officials could enter into leases. We were happy to  hear  that,  because  I
would  like  to  highlight  to  the  Minister  that  there  are   instances,
especially at  provincial  level,  where  various  departments  are  leasing
premises, for example, in shopping centres, whereas nearby there  are  empty
government buildings. I would like  the  Minister  to  address  that  issue.
Probably she has addressed it, but I would like  to  highlight  it  in  this
declaration. Otherwise, we support her budget.

Mr M M CHIKANE: Chairperson, the ANC will support this Budget Vote. We  know
that Public Works was the face of the  RDP  of  our  people  under  Minister
Radebe, and we are happy to see him here. It continues to be the  source  of
empowerment to the majority of our people who were excluded from  resources.
We know  that  when  we  speak  about  empowerment,  we  actually  mean  the
construction and development of new assets in both urban and rural areas.

We  also  believe  that  this  department  has  continuously   carried   the
responsibility for making a difference, especially in areas where  resources
were deliberately not made available by apartheid. We  renew  hospitals,  we
build clinics where they did not exist and we provide  infrastructure  where
none ever existed. As the ANC we support this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 7 - Government Communication and Information System - put.

Vote agreed to (Democratic Party and Federal Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 8 - National Treasury - agreed to.

Vote No 9 - Public Enterprises - put.
Declarations of vote:

Mr R J HEINE: Chairperson, although we are moving in the right direction  as
far as the restructuring of the state-owned enterprises  is  concerned,  the
process is too slow and there are too many outstanding issues. Let  me  name
a few. Firstly, the most important is the transgression  of  the  principles
of corporate governance, for example  the  SAA's  Macozoma  mess.  It  keeps
haunting us - the latest revelation is about Coleman Andrews's house  -  and
yet  Mr  Macozoma  still  owes  the  taxpayer  some  explanation  about  his
unacceptable and irresponsible behaviour. The  matter  about  Mr  Jakavula's
improper housing deal, although he was suspended, is still unresolved.

Let me turn to Alexkor. It has been managed by two companies over  the  past
three years, and yet there is  no  finalisation  regarding  management  fees
owed to the previous management company, although their contract expired  at
the end of May 2001. From June 2001 to 31 May 2002,  Mintek  took  over  the
management and their contract  has  also  expired.  Who  at  this  stage  is
managing Alexkor, and when will some announcement be made?

The listing of  the  Airports  Company  of  South  Africa,  Acsa,  has  been
postponed several times, and there is still  no  certainty  when  this  will
happen. Although it is such an obvious choice, there is now a  rumour  going
around that between the Minister of Public Enterprises and the  Minister  of
Transport there is disagreement about whether it should be listed or not.

The list is long, but suffice it to say that because  of  these  outstanding
issues and many more, the DA cannot support the Budget Vote.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Chairperson, private  enterprise  is  outperforming  public
enterprise in delivering quality transport services to South  Africans.  The
taxi industry has, through better  and  cheaper  private  services,  already
lured away  millions  of  Metrorail's  daily  commuters.  Long-distance  bus
companies have, through better and cheaper private services,  already  lured
away most of  Spoornet's  passengers.  Long-haul  trucking  companies  have,
through better and cheaper private services, already taken over the bulk  of
Spoornet's freight business, leaving South Africa's roads in a mess.

There is only one way to turn  the  tide  back  from  road  to  rail:  Allow
private enterprise to deliver a quality rail service,  while  injecting  the
necessary capital to address the backlog in the maintenance of  the  system.
We are not preaching the holus-bolus privatisation  of  Transnet,  but  only
that of its operational part. No government can  allow  itself  to  be  held
ransom by labour unions that prioritise the feathering of  their  own  nests
above the needs of the poor or the interests of South Africans.

The New NP does not wish to demand; we simply support the Government in  its
policies to render better services and stimulate growth  by  unleashing  the
power of private enterprise and individual entrepreneurship. We  believe  in
the President's vision that the rebirth of Africa shall be achieved  by  the
excellence of its own children.

Notwithstanding our reservations, the New NP will support this Budget Vote.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the ACDP will support this Budget Vote, but  with
reservations,  as  Government  is  perceived  by  serious  commentators  and
observers of the South African economy to be dragging its feet on the  issue
of privatisation. Apart  from  major  areas  such  as  transport,  including
harbours and ports, which should be privatised, in almost  every  Government
department there are things that Government should  not  be  doing.  Certain
elements like catering, for example, should be privatised.

More than 90% of the world's trade passes through ports, and  inefficiencies
inhibit  economic  growth.  The  experience  in  the   UK,   with   outright
privatisation of ports, shows that capital  investment  grew  by  50%  in  a
decade, turnover and tonnage of cargo grew more than 20% each,  labour  fell
by 40% and profitability grew by 220%.  Of  course,  new  jobs  are  created
where the economy thrives.
UK ports are now reported to be among the  most  efficient  in  Europe.  The
public sector cannot create wealth, but can and must provide the  conditions
in which wealth can be created by  the  private  sector  -  this  being  the
private sector's primary purpose.

Aspects of Eskom - such as delivery, and not generation -  Transnet,  Telkom
and Denel have the potential to make a large contribution to  the  country's
wellbeing through privatisation which would enhance efficiency  and  improve
customer service. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairman, the PAC, as indicated earlier, thinks that  the
budget allocated to Public Enterprises is quite adequate  and  supports  it.
Our concern is that the policy of privatisation  or  restructuring  requires
many public  institutions  to  be  jettisoned  and  replaced  with  minority
economic domination. This policy means that the  path  of  development  with
equity is abandoned and emancipatory  democracy  takes  a  back  seat.  This
exposes the  poor  to  ruthless  economic  exploitation  and  servitude.  It
enriches the rich and makes the poor poorer. It creates a  massive  loss  of
jobs.

We think that the privatisation of state assets at the expense of  the  poor
and the dispossessed is an IMF plot to further deepen the  expropriation  of
African wealth from Africans. It is an attempt at the recolonisation of  the
continent. [Applause.]

Mr B A D MARTINS: Chairperson, the Department  of  Public  Works  engages  a
number of challenges very dynamically in the interests  of  the  country.  I
therefore support the Budget Vote.

Vote agreed to (Democratic Party and Federal Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 10 - Public Service and Administration - agreed to.

Vote No 11 - Public Service Commission - agreed to.

Vote No 12 - South African Management Development Institute - agreed to.
Vote No 13 - Statistics South Africa - agreed to.

Vote No 14 - Arts, Culture, Science and Technology - put.

Declarations of vote:

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, hierdie Minister is in  'n  posisie  om
die Grondwet se standpunt oor veeltaligheid 'n werklikheid te maak.  Die  VF
steun hom in enige poging om dit moontlik te maak. Ons is wel bekommerd  oor
verskillende aspekte, byvoorbeeld die Pansat, wat al verder agter  raak  met
sy werksaamhede en waar die uitsprake wat wel die afgelope  ruk  gemaak  is,
deur staatsdepartement geïgnoreer word.

Ons is ook bekommerd oor taalwetgewing wat tans vasgehaak het. Die  Minister
was eerlik genoeg om tydens die begrotingspos vir ons te sê dit het  by  die
Departement van Onderwys  vasgehaak.  Daar  sal  baie  meer  rustigheid  oor
taalsake kom, as hierdie wetgewing bevredigend opgestel en aanvaar word.

Ons steun die  Minister  in  sy  pogings  om  byvoorbeeld  veeltaligheid  te
bevorder.  Waar  daar  reeds  rekenaarwoordeboeke  in  Afrikaans  en  Engels
bestaan, wil ons hom gelukwens met die ontwikkeling van  rekenaarwoordeboeke
ook  in  van  die  ander  amptelike  tale  van  Suid-Afrika.  Dit  help   om
agterstande uit te wis en help om die tale op gelyke vlak te  bring  en  ook
weer  waardigheid  vir  almal  terug  te  bring.  Die  VF  sal  wel  hierdie
begrotingspos ondersteun. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  declaration  of  vote
follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, this Minister is in  a  position  to  make
the viewpoint of the Constitution regarding multilingualism a  reality.  The
FF supports him in any effort  to  make  this  possible.  We  are,  however,
concerned about different aspects, for  example  Pansalb,  who  are  lagging
further and further behind with its work and where the announcements,  which
were in fact made a while ago, are being ignored by state departments.

We are also concerned about language legislation which  has  currently  come
to a standstill. The Minister was  honest  enough  to  tell  us  during  the
Budget Vote  that  it  has  come  to  a  standstill  at  the  Department  of
Education. Much tranquillity regarding language matters will  come  to  pass
if this legislation is compiled in a satisfactory way and accepted.

We  support  the  Minister  in  his  effort   to,   for   example,   promote
multilingualism. Where computer dictionaries already exist in Afrikaans  and
English we would like to congratulate him with the development  of  computer
dictionaries in some of the other official languages of South  Africa.  This
helps to eliminate backlogs and  helps  to  bring  the  languages  on  equal
levels as well as to restore the dignity of everyone. The  FF  will  support
this Budget Vote.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, the MF supports this Vote and  has  certain
comments. The  progress  that  we  have  made  through  this  department  is
impressive. We have South African entertainment,  museums  and  exhibitions.
The  promotion  of  the  department's  programme  is  pursued  and  this  is
remarkable.

In relation to improvements and advancements in science  it  is  noted  that
the MF supports the department in pursuing science as  a  credible  subject.
We have advanced so far that we have had the first South African  in  space.
The MF supports this Vote.

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Mr Chairperson, the ANC supports this budget.  We  note  in
particular the  increase  in  the  budget  for  PanSALB,  which  deals  with
languages and whose activities will increase 16,4% from last year  to  26,1%
this year.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Government's  policy  to  promote
multilingualism in this country.

We also observe a notable increase in science  and  technology,  which  will
consume about 96% of the budget in the medium term. This  is  also  in  line
with the Government's policy to encourage skills development in science  and
technology. Therefore we support this Budget Vote.

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 15 - Education - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr R S NTULI: Mr Chairperson, the common desire to afford the best  possible
education for our children remains elusive,  despite  the  tireless  efforts
and zeal of the hon the Minister of Education. We recognise the  improvement
made by the  department  and  the  sound  policy  frameworks.  However,  the
infrastructure scenario remains  bleak.  The  effects  of  underspending  on
infrastructural development that historically disadvantaged learners  suffer
are schools without water and  electricity  and  with  poor  security.  This
creates very unfavourable conditions for learning.

Furthermore, many schools, as recently as 2 June, were still experiencing  a
critical textbook shortage, especially in the Eastern Cape.  Corruption  and
financial mismanagement are still  common  occurrences  in  some  provinces,
again notably the Eastern Cape. There is no coherent programme  for  teacher
development  and  evaluation  or  for   capacity   development   in   school
management.

Finally, curriculum uncertainty for the current group of Standard  9  pupils
tells a sad story. The lack of a new curriculum for  learners  in  Grade  10
poses a problem next year, because  these  children  have  been  exposed  to
Curriculum 2005 for three years. If they revert to the  old  syllabus,  they
will definitely experience problems. There is no  articulation  between  the
old and the new  syllabuses.  The  department  has  not  done  its  homework
properly, despite the fact that they have known  since  1997  that  this  is
coming. The DP opposes the Vote. [Interjections.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Chairperson, breaking the  back  of  illiteracy  in  five
years was the undertaking made by the Minister of Education a year ago.  Two
years later, we see only scratches on  the  back  of  illiteracy.  Of  major
concern to us is the underspending in some  conditional  grants.  The  Thuba
Makote rural school building project,  for  example,  where  the  department
expects to spend only R1,5 million of  the  allocated  R48  million,  causes
concern,  as  does  the  phasing  out  of  specific  conditional  grants  to
provinces at the end of the MTEF. For instance, the Ikhwelo  Abet  grant  is
being phased out. We would like to know from the department how it is  going
to fill this budgetary void.

Another concern is what happens at  the  district  level  of  the  education
system. There is no legislation governing the provisioning of  education  at
this level. At worst, we have managers who have got  no  authority  at  all.
The recent example of inspectors not being allowed to  carry  out  what  was
national policy leaves us very concerned indeed.  Let  us  do  something  to
restore authority and accountability at that level. The  IFP  supports  this
Budget Vote.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson ...
The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Boy, behave yourself!

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: I will behave, but unfortunately  I  cannot  support  the
Minister's Budget Vote for the following  reasons,  and  we  are  forced  to
oppose it. With reference to the institutional  character  of  universities,
the Minister said on 27 February in this House  (Questions  and  Replies  of
the National Assembly, col 76):


  I am very sensitive to this fact  that  there  should  be  some  kind  of
  institutional  life  associated  with  the  culture,  tradition  and  the
  history.

Unfortunately, the announced plan for the restructuring of higher  education
does not underpin the sentiments of the hon the Minister.  Furthermore,  the
Minister said that the findings of the Council on Higher Education  and  the
Gerwel report  will  make  sure  that  no  Afrikaans-medium  institution  is
penalised in the national plan for higher education.

Not only was the content of these reports not released as  promised  by  the
Minister, but Afrikaans-medium institutions were indeed penalised. They  are
forced to  introduce  double-medium  and  parallel-medium  teaching  without
extra financial back-up from the  state,  while  this  is  not  expected  of
English-medium institutions.

Finally, the Minister said that part of the programme for restructuring  was
that some of the  institutions  would  be  encouraged  to  start  developing
indigenous languages and lead into teaching in those  indigenous  languages.
But none of this emanated from the plan on higher education.

As gevolg van die totale  afwesigheid  van  'n  taalplan  wat  veeltaligheid
bevorder aan hoër opvoedkundige inrigtings, kan ons ongelukkig  nie  hierdie
onderwysbegrotingspos steun nie. Andersins  doen  die  Minister  uitstekende
werk.  [Owing  to  the  total  absence  of   a   language   plan   promoting
multilingualism at higher education institutions,  we  unfortunately  cannot
support this education Vote.  Otherwise  the  Minister  is  doing  excellent
work.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the ACDP  is  unable  to  support  the  Education
budget, primarily for the following reasons. Large amounts of  public  funds
will be placed in the hand of PPASA, or the Planned  Parenthood  Association
of South Africa, to implement life-skills, HIV/Aids and sexuality  education
in schools, and we are concerned that  the  Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill
will further undermine school governing bodies.

PPASA won the  tender  for  sex  education  in  schools.  They  are  proudly
antifamily and proabortion, licentious sex and deviant  lifestyles  such  as
homosexuality. The founder  of  Planned  Parenthood  was  motivated  by  her
belief that the marriage bed is the most denigrating  influence  of  society
and that birth control and abortion would  eliminate  what  she  called  the
weeds of the world and  the  genetically  inferior  races.  Of  course,  she
started her abortion clinics in the black and Hispanic areas in  the  United
States. Now Africa, and especially South Africa,  has  opened  its  arms  to
this wicked agenda.

Life Skills  and  HIV/Aids  Education:  a  Manual  and  Resource  Guide  for
Intermediate Phase School Teachers by PPASA says Grade 4 pupils, or 10-year-
olds, are to be taught by the teacher about sexual intercourse and  that  it
is essential for children, by at least Grade 6, or 12 years old, to  have  a
clear understanding of the exact mechanics  of  how  to  give  a  female  an
orgasm, including how a female or male can give a woman oral sex  or  manual
stimulation. PPASA tells teachers that  learners  need  to  understand  that
their feelings about homosexuals are based on  irrational  prejudice  rather
than fact. Worksheets ask children if it feels OK to  caress  to  orgasm  or
have intercourse with an acquaintance, a good friend  of  the  same  sex,  a
good friend of the other sex or a date. No mention is  made  of  ``husband''
or ``wife'', but, of course, marriage is a dirty word for PPASA.

There are many other profamily organisations that have  excellent  HIV/Aids,
life, love  and  sex  education  curricula  available  right  now,  like  No
Apologies by Focus on the Family. These should replace PPASA. The ACDP  does
not support this Budget Vote.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek  gaan  nie  'n  geen  4-18-toespraak
lewer nie.  Ek  gaan  oor  iets  anders  praat.  Die  VF  is  bekommerd  oor
verskillende aspekte van onderwys in Suid-Afrika. Ons het ons  bekommernisse
tydens die onderwysdebat uitgespreek en aan die  Minister  duidelik  gestel.
Ek het slegs tyd vir een voorbeeld.

In die Weskaap is daar drie universiteite. Die Wes-Kaapse bevolking  is  60%
Afrikaanssprekend.  Dit  regverdig  tog  sekerlik  dat  twee   van   hierdie
universiteite Afrikaans behoort te wees - sou ons dan werklik  veeltaligheid
bevorder. Tans is twee van die universiteite Engels. Stellenbosch  is  reeds
dubbelmedium en daar is druk om al hoe meer Afrikaans af te skaal. Dit  maak
nie vir ons sin nie. Ons verstaan dit nie.

Ons het waardering  dat  Minister  Asmal  verlede  Maandag  'n  VF-dinkskrum
bygewoon het, waar hy sy standpunte gestel het. Ek dink  nie  daar  is  baie
Ministers wat so in die leeu se kuil sal inloop nie - Piet  Retief  het  dit
laas gedoen, so ver ek weet. Ons het tog  waardering  daarvoor  dat  hy  dit
gedoen het en sy saak by ons kom stel  het.  Dit  het  heelwat  misverstande
opgeklaar. Daar is wel  nog  onsekerheid  oor  sekere  sake  en  sodra  daar
sekerheid kom, kan ons ons standpunt wysig. Daar is nog onsekerheid oor  die
Gerwelverslag, die rol van beheerrade en dies meer. Ons het  waardering  vir
sy gesprek met ons, maar ons gaan teen die begrotingspos stem.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, I am not going to deliver a  no-4-18  speech.
I am going to talk about something else. The FF is concerned  about  various
aspects of education  in  South  Africa.  During  the  education  debate  we
expressed our concerns and clearly explained them to the  Minister.  I  only
have time for one example.

There are three universities in the  Western  Cape.  Sixty  percent  of  the
Western Cape's population is  Afrikaans-speaking.  That  probably  justifies
that two of these universities should be Afrikaans -  if  we  are  to  truly
promote multilingualism. Currently two  of  the  universities  are  English.
Stellenbosh is already double-medium and the pressure is on  to  scale  down
Afrikaans even more. This does not make sense to us. We  do  not  understand
it.

We have appreciation for the fact that Minister Asmal attended an FF  think-
tank last Monday, where he expressed his points of  view.  I  do  not  think
there are many Ministers who would walk into the  lion's  den  like  that  -
Piet Retief was  the  last  person  to  do  that,  as  far  as  I  know.  We
nevertheless have appreciation for his having done that and that  he  stated
his case before us. It cleared up many misunderstandings.  There  is  still,
however, uncertainty regarding certain matters  and  as  soon  as  there  is
certainty we can amend our position. There is  still  uncertainty  regarding
the Gerwel report, the role of the control boards  and  so  forth.  We  have
appreciation for his discussion with us, but we  are  going  to  oppose  the
Budget Vote.]

Prof S M MAYATULA: Chairperson, how I wish all the members  could  be  in  a
position to attend our portfolio committee meetings,  where  some  of  these
issues are debated and discussed. I think it would have been  good  to  call
in Love Life, so that we could  read  more  and  understand  more  than  the
excerpts we get from different papers. Unfortunately, some  of  the  members
are unable to do that. Even when they refer to infrastructure,  some  people
are misguided and their views misplaced.

The President was talking in this very Chamber  and  said  that  no  student
should be allowed to learn under a  tree.  There  is  a  document  that  was
tabled before the committee  where  the  Government  committed  itself  that
during the next MTEF all provincial departments must  come  with  all  their
plans, so that money can be put aside in order to change those things.  When
we talk about Thuba Makote and Ikhwelo, again these are long-term  projects.
People say the money has not been used. The money  has  been  committed  and
that is why we are talking about a three-year system, so  that  we  put  the
money aside to address these issues.

Regarding the issue of language, I do not know for how long we are going  to
be addressing this issue. At no stage  is  this  Government  saying  that  a
language, whatever language, should be undermined.  All  the  Government  is
saying is that we must do whatever we can in order not to  use  language  to
prevent others from coming in, as was the case in many instances.

Regarding the Education Laws Amendment Bill,  the  Bill  is  going  to  come
before the committee and we are going to have public hearings and  everybody
can come there and ask why it is what it is. Some people unfortunately  take
it out of its context, because that Bill is not meant  to  be  what  members
are saying it should be. [Time expired.]

Division demanded.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, are we permitted to know  what  happened  to  the
hon the Minister of Education's voting  system?  Did  he  vote  against  his
Budget Vote, perhaps? [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think the hon the Minister's mechanism  was
not working.

Vote No 16 - Health - put.

Declarations of vote:

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I call  on  the  hon  member  Mrs  Kalyan  to
address the House. [Interjections.] Order, hon members! Hon members,  order!
Please take your seat, hon Kalyan. Order! Hon members, I am addressing  you.
There has been a request from the Presiding Officers that  we  refrain  from
the catcalls that are being made. [Laughter.] I think that it was made in  a
serious light. It is a ruling of the Chair and I now appeal to  hon  members
to abide by it. Let us afford the hon member an opportunity  to  speak.  Hon
member, please proceed. [Interjections.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Thank you, Chair. While there has been  a  welcome  increase
in the Health budget, the reality is  that  the  Department  of  Health  has
failed in its goal of providing better health for all. On Tuesday  we  heard
the Minister of Health state that she had reason to celebrate the fact  that
HIV prevalence amongst teenagers was lower than last year.  It  is  a  well-
known fact that it takes very little to excite the hon the Minister.  But  I
think she is rather insensitive and  that  she  misled  the  House,  because
statistically her facts were not significant. Furthermore,  she  omitted  to
say that the report states that there  is  a  significant  increase  in  HIV
prevalence amongst women in the 30-39 age category.

The Minister condemns at least 200 vulnerable, helpless babies a day  to  an
HIV-positive status, because she refuses to comply with the court  order  to
roll out nevirapine. Instead, she has forked out a sum of  R2,6  million  to
date to defend the court case.

The Department of Health failed to put  in  a  request  for  global  funding
timeously, and the Minister has  since  thrown  her  toys  out  of  her  cot
because KwaZulu-Natal was awarded funding. If the  Minister  cannot  do  her
job, she should not punish  others  because  they  are  doing  it  for  her.
[Interjections.]

The Department of Health has wasted large sums of money  on  consultants.  A
sum of R605 000 was paid  to  one  consultant  to  conduct  a  PR  programme
involving celebrities to help in HIV awareness, and is but  one  example  of
the mismanagement of funds in the Department of Health.

I could go on and highlight many more failures of the Department of  Health,
but time does not permit me. [Interjections.]  The  poor  track  record  and
incompetence of the Minister speak for themselves.  The  DA  cannot  support
the Health Budget Vote.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, while the IFP supports the Health  budget,  we
disapprove of aspects in the Constitution and health policies that  resulted
in R78 million of funds budgeted for NGOs' Aids programmes and  R30  million
in conditional grants to provinces for Aids not  being  spent  in  the  past
financial year.

We strongly recommend a simplification in the distribution of authority  and
responsibility to local, provincial and national  governments  so  that  the
choking bureaucracy is untangled and the Health department's  work  is  made
more efficient and accountable. This would immediately lift  the  morale  of
nurses and doctors and improve our ability to cope with Aids.

We are also advocating change in Government's focus from rights  to  privacy
to rights to life. However, we endorse the move  towards  partnerships  with
private management  teams  and  the  increase  in  equitable  share  to  the
provinces.

Dr S J GOUS:  Chairperson,  during  the  Budget  Vote  debate  on  Health  I
highlighted some of the problems the New NP had. These problems  included  a
serious lack of service delivery to the public at certain hospitals and,  to
be more specific, in the  Eastern  Province,  Mpumalanga  and  the  Northern
Province. These problems are, however, of a provincial nature and we  cannot
hold the national Department of Health responsible for them.

Other critical areas identified included medicine control, the  brain  drain
involving health workers, the misuse of  compulsory  community  service  and
obvious problems with the medical schemes.

When we examine the Government's  HIV/Aids  response  objectively,  we  find
that substantial funds are made available. We see massive awareness and  the
education campaigns; we see campaigns promoting  the  use  of  condoms,  SDI
programmes  and  the  traditional  healer  forum;  we  see  home-based  care
initiatives, counsellor training  and  vaccine  support;  we  see  voluntary
counselling and testing programmes,  substantial  NGO  funding  surveillance
and resource programmes, etc. I could go on.

In fact, we probably have the most comprehensive  response  to  HIV/Aids  in
the world, and certainly the best in  Africa,  as  confirmed  by  the  World
Health Organisation and the United Nations. And yes, of  course,  we  differ
on some elements. We all have our pet subjects and our own view on the  rate
at which certain elements must be implemented.

We now have a large-scale mother-to-child prevention roll-out, and there  is
commitment to antiretroviral use for rape survivors. Common  sense  dictates
that antiretrovirals for Aids sufferers are inevitable; it is a question  of
time.

The New NP cannot allow a few missing elements or a difference  in  emphasis
to jeopardise the HIV/Aids response. It is more critical that  we  all  work
together to eradicate poverty and HIV/Aids. We would rather be part  of  the
solution than part of the problem. The New NP will  therefore  support  this
budget. [Applause.]
Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, 49% of the budget for health programmes  goes  to
maternal, child and  women's  health,  and  this  is  where  termination  of
pregnancy is not only implemented but promoted.

To date 220 888 babies, who were created in  every  detail  by  God  with  a
specific plan  and  purpose  for  their  lives,  are  being  and  have  been
butchered and thrown in the  trash,  and  Government  is  paying  for  these
barbaric deeds with our tax money.

Abortion is referred to in this House as  saving  women's  lives,  but  this
gross distortion of the facts cannot be backed up  by  statistics  that  are
quoted. The ACDP will not condone these atrocities and, once again,  has  no
option but to vote against the Health budget.

The war against HIV/Aids will only be won by a  dramatic  change  in  sexual
behaviour, and Planned Parenthood and  Love  Life's  offensive  material  in
schools and through the media, and an indiscriminate promotion  of  condoms,
fuel the out-of-control fire. Children need to learn about self-respect  and
dignity, not how to have sex, lesbian oral sex, orgasm, access  to  abortion
clinics, masturbation and gay cruising. [Interjections.]

Love Life, an off-shoot of  Planned  Parenthood,  receives  R25 million  per
annum, through the Health budget, to implement its  own  programme.  Planned
Parenthood's life-skills education in schools receives an additional 14%  of
the Health budget and condoms make up another large  percentage.  Now  there
are one-stop shops. Paying lip service ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!  Please  take  your  seat,  hon
member.

The MINISTER FOR INTELLIGENCE: Chairperson, there  must  be  something  else
that the  hon  member  can  talk  about  other  than  sex.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Continue,  hon  member.  [Interjections.]
Please continue.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Paying lip service to abstinence  is  a  sham.  Where  is  the
funding for organisations that not  only  promote  the  real  prevention  of
Aids, which  is  sexual  abstinence  before  marriage  and  faithfulness  in
marriage, but believe that our children are able  to  achieve  these  goals.
Now Government has put Love Life and the Kaiser Foundation in charge of  its
R157 million HIV/Aids budget, and all foreign donor funding as  well.  These
organisations are notoriously anti family values and the ACDP  is  concerned
that NGOs that promote family values will be further discriminated  against.
[Time expired.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, die VF word daagliks deur  lede  van  die
publiek  oorval  met  klagtes  rakende  die  situasie   in   Suid-Afrikaanse
hospitale. Dié klagtes gaan oor die standaard van dienste wat  daar  gelewer
word. Daar word dan telkens gesê dat die probleem finansieel van aard is.

Ons het gister in dié Huis gehoor dat daar as  gevolg  van  geboue  wat  nie
verhuur word nie, maar leegstaan, 'n bedrag  van  ongeveer  R1  miljoen  per
maand - R12 miljoen per jaar - verlore gaan. Daardie geld, en  geld  wat  op
baie ander plekke vermors word, sou gebruik kon word.

Die Regering se ommekeer ten opsigte van die MIV-beleid het nie veel  anders
as totale verwarring by die publiek bereik nie. Die skandalige  wyse  waarop
dr Thys van Mollendorff, die voormalige superintendent van die Rob  Ferreira
Hospitaal in Nelspruit, ontslaan is, is 'n  bevestiging  daarvan.  Aangesien
die Regering sy beleid verander het, behoort hulle die eerbare weg  te  volg
deur dr Van Mollendorff weer in sy posisie aan te  stel.  Hy  het  toegesien
dat antiretrovirale middels  toegedien  is  om  juis  die  Vigs-pandemie  te
voorkom. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson, the FF is inundated  daily  with  complaints
from the public with regard to the situation  in  South  African  hospitals.
These complaints are about the standard of services delivered there.  It  is
said time and again that the nature of the problem is financial.
Yesterday we heard in this House that an amount of approximately R1  million
per month - R12 million per annum  -  is  lost  because  buildings  are  not
rented, but stand empty. That money, as well as money wasted in  many  other
places, could be used.

The Government's about-face with regard to the HIV policy has  not  achieved
much apart from utter confusion amongst the public. The  scandalous  way  in
which Dr Thys van Mollendorff, former superintendent  of  the  Rob  Ferreira
Hospital in Nelspruit, was dismissed, is confirmation  of  this.  Since  the
Government has changed its policy, it should  do  the  honourable  thing  by
reinstating  Dr  Van  Mollendorff  in  his   position.   He   ensured   that
antiretroviral medication was administered, precisely to  prevent  the  Aids
pandemic.]

I was listening to the  hon  Dr  Gous  this  afternoon.  When  I  heard  his
compelling argument about why one  should  vote  against  this  department's
budget I said to myself: Well, if even  the  New  NP  is  prepared  to  vote
against the budget, then surely there must be something terribly wrong  with
that budget. But, in the end, to my surprise I  was,  unfortunately,  proven
wrong again. The New NP is supporting it but, I am afraid, the FF  will  not
be able to support this Vote. We will vote against it.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, the situation with regard to health in  the
country is detrimental, as a healthy nation makes a better  and  a  stronger
nation. Minimal resources  exist  and  poor  conditions  accumulate  at  the
department. We stress the need to set, improve and maintain  healthy  people
and healthy living conditions, and the need to set  parameters  to  maintain
healthy living conditions is tremendous. The MF feels that  measures  should
be taken to promote a healthy nation at all levels of the community. The  MF
firmly supports Budget Vote 16.

Mr L V J NGCULU: Mr Chairperson, the ANC is unequivocal in its  support  for
this budget. This is a budget which South Africans have  hailed  as  a  good
budget. This is a budget about poverty alleviation.  This  is  a  budget  to
address inequalities and inequities amongst and between provinces.
On the question of HIV/Aids, the ANC remains steadfast that HIV/Aids is  not
a political football. It is an issue about people's health. We are sure,  if
one looks at our budget, that the issue of HIV/Aids and  other  issues  have
been adequately addressed in the budget. It is also important to  note  that
on 17 April 2002 Cabinet issued a statement, and that statement  closed  the
debate on the issue of HIV/Aids. It is therefore out of that commitment  and
the steadfast programmes of our Government that one sees  in  the  statement
issued later on with regard to the question of HIV prevalence that there  is
stabilisation. It is a fact that cannot be denied even by those  who  always
like to draw us to problems.

As members of Parliament, ours is to respond to the  clarion  call:  Let  us
lend a caring hand of hope. Let us join in partnership for  a  better  life.
Let  join  in  partnership  for  better  health  for  all.  It  is   through
partnership that all of us can win and replace despair  and  surrender  with
hope and optimism.

With regard to the termination of pregnancy and Love Life, let me  only  say
that the termination of pregnancy is not about abortion. It is about  giving
women a choice, and nothing else. [Applause.] It is also important  to  note
that the programmes of Love Life are aimed at nothing but saving life.  This
is a commitment of our Government, to save life at all times.  That  is  why
we  should  always  remain  saying  that  we  should  support  this  budget.
[Applause.]

Vote accordingly agreed to.

Vote No 17 - Housing - agreed to.

Vote No 18 - Social Development - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mrs S V KALYAN: Mr Chairperson, the DP welcomes the increase in this  year's
budget for the child support grants and old age pensions but notes that  60%
of the poor get no social assistance grants.

One of Government's main objectives is to  alleviate  poverty  to  create  a
better  life  for  all.  Therefore  it  makes  good  sense  to   develop   a
comprehensive social security system  to  achieve  this  goal.  The  present
system  is  hopelessly  inadequate.  The  Taylor  report   calls   for   the
introduction of a basic income grant and  a  national  insurance  scheme  to
address the present gaps. This report has been welcomed by many  but  it  is
unfortunate that the Department of Social Development  has  remained  silent
on the recommendations. Suffice it to say that the basic  income  grant  was
beyond its present budget. The  reality  is  that  the  basic  income  grant
[Interjections.] ...

AN HON MEMBER: [Inaudible.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: ... will go a long way to improve  nutrition  and  alleviate
poverty. [Interjections.] Yes, I have.

June has been declared Youth Month. But the youth in the age group of  7  to
18 years have nothing to cheer about. They receive no  social  support  from
the Government and unfortunately a large number  of  children  in  this  age
group have been orphaned as a direct result of the  HIV/Aids  pandemic.  The
DP appeals to the Minister to extend the  child  support  grant  to  include
these children and reduce their  burden  and  calls  on  Government  to  act
speedily on the Taylor recommendations. The DP supports this budget.

Prof  I  J  MOHAMED:  Mr  Chairperson,  this  year  the  budget  for  social
development includes an amount of more than R20 billion for the  payment  of
social security grants, which represents more than 90% of  the  consolidated
budget for social development. This compares very favourably with  the  kind
of social security benefits paid by other developing countries.  We  commend
the Minister for the consistent increases in this regard.

However, we would also like to appeal to the Minister about  the  fact  that
less  than  10%  of  the  consolidated  budget  for  social  development  is
available for developmental services. We want to urge the Minister  to  give
serious attention to  the  allocations  to  these  programmes  as  they  are
crucial in our efforts  to  improve  the  developmental  capacities  of  our
people, and more  especially  the  children.  I  support  the  Budget  Vote.
[Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 19 - Sport and Recreation South Africa - put.

Declaration of vote:

Ms  N  R  NTSHULANA-BHENGU:  Mr  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the   main
beneficiaries of Government resources in the  past  were  the  minority  who
accounted  for  only  20%  of  the   country's   population.   The   unequal
distribution of resources led to many others with backgrounds such as  those
of Benni McCarthy, Willie Mtolo and Makhaya Ntini not emerging and  reaching
their fullest potential.

We will always support a Vote which seeks to redress the  imbalance  of  the
past and use sport as a tool for development  and  poverty  eradication.  We
commend our Government's continued attempts  to  address  transformation  in
sport. The Budget Vote is a step in the right direction  for  South  African
sport. We, in the ANC support the Budget Vote. [Applause.]
Vote agreed  to  (Democratic  Party,  Federal  Alliance  and  Freedom  Front
dissenting).

Vote No 20 - Correctional Services - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Chairperson, the DA is absolutely shocked and  disgusted  by
the Special Assignment programme on Tuesday night.

Mr D A  A  OLIFANT:  Mr  Chairperson,  on  a  point  of  order:  Is  the  DA
represented in this House? There is no such party here.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member at the  podium,  there  has
been a decision that you refer to your party as the DP.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairperson, may I address you  on  that  point  of  order,
please? [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Proceed, Mr Ellis.
Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairperson, the hon member at the  podium  is  talking  on
behalf of the Democratic Alliance generally. [Interjections.] It  is  not  a
motion, she is not proposing a motion on behalf of a party. She  is  talking
generally on behalf of the DA. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  do  not  know  whether  the
legislation is already enforced. It may allow them all to cross to  the  DA.
But, as we speak here, they represent the DP.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, the  party  you  represent
in this House is the DP. Can you speak on behalf of that party.

I  will  not  be  taking  any  more  points  of  order.  It  is  a   simple,
straightforward matter. The DP is represented here and you are  speaking  on
behalf of that party.

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson, it is not a  formal  motion.  I  can  understand
that, in connection with formal motions, one cannot propose a formal  motion
on behalf of a party that is not represented in the House.  [Interjections.]
But, in the same way, someone can say, ``I speak  for  the  poor  people  in
rural areas'' as  a  general  statement  expressing  a  view  without  being
confined to a political party. [Interjections.] One can speak on  behalf  of
sportspeople in South Africa. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, we will not proceed  with
that debate here. We will look into  the  matter  and  report  back  to  the
House. [Interjections.] Please proceed hon member.

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  The  Democratic  ...  [Laughter]
... Party was absolutely  shocked  and  disgusted  by  the  content  of  the
programme,  Special  Assignment,  which  was   shown   on   Tuesday   night.
[Interjections.] The  corruption  and  mismanagement  should  be  vigorously
dealt with by Minister Skosana.

The DP has continuously tried to get this Government to  deal  with  corrupt
officials in this department as well as the  entire  Public  Service,  as  a
matter of urgency. When prisoners start rooting  out  corruption,  there  is
something seriously wrong in the country. The  New  NP  and  ANC  Government
must  remember  that  every  cent  lost  through   fraud,   corruption   and
mismanagement is money that is directly contributed  by  ordinary  taxpayers
and the business community of this country. In this specific  case,  the  DP
believes that many innocent and  committed  warders  often  sacrifice  their
lives because of the risks of  their  jobs  and  long  working  hours.  They
receive a net income of as little as R1 500 a month.

The DP cannot support this Vote and calls for a special debate. The DP  also
demands that the salaries of warders and middle  management  be  revised  to
prevent  them  from  considering  bribes  as  additional  income;  that  the
whistleblowers  and   Director   Setlai,   who   disclosed   this   shocking
information, be  praised  and  protected  by  the  Minister;  and  that  the
juveniles who were shown on TV and who were sodomised by adult  inmates,  as
portrayed, and other similar suspected cases be tested for HIV/Aids.
Tomorrow will be the ideal opportunity  for  those  members  to  show  their
commitment to the people and show their wisdom as  politicians  by  crossing
the floor from this side of the House to the other side and  bring  the  ANC
to 49% so that we can have a multiparty Government, and start to all  govern
for a better life for all. [Time expired.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mr Chairman, on a point of order: I would like to  put  it
to you that if you are not going to allow people to speak on behalf  of  the
DA or FA, then I will urge you to give  my  party  an  opportunity  to  also
raise our objections to the  Votes.  [Interjections.]  Mr  Chairman,  please
protect me! [Interjections.] Mr Chairman, I am asking for  your  protection.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Yes, hon member. Please  continue  but
be brief.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mr Chairman, I have requested  that  you  should  give  my
party an opportunity to make declarations of vote on all  those  Votes  that
we have not supported.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We will  ask  the  Table  to  look  at
that. I am informed that you have submitted your  preferences  and  we  will
keep to the list. Please, check that out with the Table.

Adv P S SWART: Mr Chairman, whilst the ACDP will support this Vote,  it  has
the following reservations. The growth of the  budget  allocation  does  not
reflect the increasing number of expected  prisoners.  There  is  clearly  a
need  for  the  Portfolio   Committees   on   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development, Safety and Security,  and  Correctional  Services  to  meet  in
order to address issues of mutual concern, such as that of overcrowding  due
to awaiting-trial prisoners.

There is also an imbalance regarding personnel, since  there  are  plans  to
recruit 6 000 police per year whilst there has been no planned increase  for
Correctional Services. We agree that this does not make sense  as  increased
arrests will result in an increase in the number of prisoners  that  end  up
in the Correctional Services system.

We  share  the  views  expressed  regarding  the  television   coverage   of
corruption at Grootvlei  prison.  Instead  the  head  of  the  prison  being
disciplined, he should be given a  medal  for  exposing  this  evil.  It  is
disgraceful.  The  sexual  abuse  of  that  juvenile  is   sickening.   This
wickedness must be rooted out and, by all accounts, it is  endemic  in  that
prison.

We welcome the steps that have  been  taken  by  the  hon  the  Minister  in
ordering the suspension of the implicated warders and look  forward  to  the
report of the findings of the Jali  commission  of  inquiry.  Severe  prison
overcrowding  and  deplorable  health   conditions   must   be   continually
addressed. Overcrowding remains a problem  and  it  is  the  root  cause  of
health problems  and  the  spread  of  diseases  such  as  tuberculosis  and
HIV/Aids in certain prisons.

The way forward must be the application of  restorative  justice  principles
which are premised upon the acceptance of guilt by the offender and  payment
of restitution to  the  victim,  where  appropriate,  or  the  rendering  of
community service in cases where  there  is  no  danger  to  public  safety.
Silence, do I hear silence?

In conclusion, the ACDP will support this Budget Vote.

Mrs S A SEATON: Chairperson, the IFP, in supporting this Budget Vote,  takes
cognisance of the fact that there are  problems.  We  have  heard  what  the
other parties have said. We too were appalled at what we saw  on  television
the other night. However, we do congratulate our Minister  and  support  him
in his decision to, in the first place, call for inquiry  into  the  various
problems; for his suspension of the warders that have been involved in  this
particular problem; and for the transfer of those prisoners, for  their  own
safety's sake, to other prisons. I would like to congratulate the  Minister.
He has done the right thing there and we fully support him. [Applause.]

We fully support the view that the budget is insufficient to deal  with  the
problems that the department is faced with.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the
department's budget is totally insufficient  to  deal  with  the  number  of
problems that we are expected to deal with. With the  department's  decision
to create far greater rehabilitation and restoration of  our  prisoners,  we
really need to put in  more  money.  What  has  been  said  with  regard  to
salaries in the department is, without any doubt, a major problem. Even  our
safety and security officers  are  not  earning  sufficient  money  in  this
country. But there is no doubt whatsoever in our minds that  those  who  are
employed  under  the  Department  of  Correctional  Services   are   grossly
underpaid and there needs to  be  a  major  injection  of  money  into  this
department.

Notwithstanding that, we do support the Budget Vote.

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Chairperson, the budget allocation allows  the  Department
of Correctional Services to make some inroads into the  challenges  that  it
faces - challenges that are enormous and countless.
The decision to  put  rehabilitation  at  the  centre  of  the  department's
strategic plan for correctional services in South  Africa  is  laudable.  We
are aware of the irony of sending people to prison to  punish  them  and  at
the same time to rehabilitate them. We are also aware  that  the  Department
of Correctional Services cannot accomplish and meet all  challenges  on  its
own. Within the criminal justice system, consensus has to be reached by  all
partners in the security cluster to reform our penal system.

Budget Vote 20, as I have already stated, offers us  but  one  step  in  the
direction of trying to set the reform wheels in motion. It is with  that  in
mind that I offer my support, and that of the  ANC,  to  the  Department  of
Correctional Services, Minister Skosana  and  all  stakeholders  within  the
security cluster. [Applause.]

Vote No 21 - Defence - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr  A  J  BOTHA:  Madam  Speaker,  The  DP,  on  behalf  of   the   DA   ...
[Interjections.] ... opposes the Budget for the following reasons:  Firstly,
the  force  design  and  structure  of  the  National  Defence  Force   need
restructuring. The Budget does not acknowledge this need.

Secondly, spending on the arms deal for this  year  only  goes  up  to  R7,6
billion, whilst the  Department  of  Education  is  allocated  a  mere  R8,8
billion and Health has a budget of R7,1 billion.

Personnel expenditure, with the  exclusion  of  the  arms  deal,  equals  an
enormous 52% of the total budget, caused by too  many  generals  and  senior
staff. Financial losses due to theft  and  loss  of  military  property  are
unacceptably high, and no provision  for  training  to  adjust  to  the  new
armaments has been made.

A saving of approximately R8 billion by cancelling  the  second,  which  has
not been adhered to, and third tranches, should have been used, inter  alia,
to build over a million houses or fund basic support  grant  for  2  million
children at current levels of R130 per month, for six years.  It  could  pay
the salaries of almost 50 000 police constables for the 10 years  or  put  a
million children through school, for the next six years.

HON MEMBERS: Yes!

Mr A J BOTHA: The DP, on behalf of the DA, will not be party to a budget  as
inconsiderate to the poor as this one. [Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker and  the  hon  House,  although  the  IFP  will
support the Budget, we want to raise these concerns: The  first  concern  is
the control of theft within the department. The department itself said  that
they could not control it. They do not even know who stole  what,  when  and
how. Therefore we want that to be controlled. It is very important.

The second concern is the boosting of the  morale  of  soldiers,  especially
those who are deployed  outside  the  country.  It  is  important  that  the
soldiers be looked after, especially those who are outside the  country,  so
that they should still feel some  warmth  while  they  are  not  with  their
families. They should be looked after thoroughly and properly  because  they
are human beings like all of us.

The last concern is that the soldiers  should  be  improved  when  they  are
deployed within the area of South Africa, especially when they are  deployed
with the police, to make sure that they know  the  rules  of  the  game.  To
deploy them without proper training, with  the  police,  will  put  them  in
jeopardy, and that will  put  the  department  in  jeopardy.  Therefore  the
department must avoid being pursued by the individual and  private  citizens
by deploying soldiers when they are not supposed to be deployed.

We support the Budget.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, die Nasionale Weermag het  'n  taak  om
te verrig. Sy belangrikste taak is die  handhawing  van  die  soewereiniteit
van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika.

Dit is ongelukkig so dat die wapentransaksie 'n negatiewe beeld geskep  het.
Persepsies het ontstaan dat die Nasionale Weermag korrup is, en dat dit  nie
goed gegaan het nie. Die werklikheid  is  dat  dit  nie  billik  is  om  die
wapentransaksie op die brood van die Suid-Afrikaanse  Nasionale  Weermag  te
smeer nie.

Die VF sal hierdie begrotingspos steun, maar  dit  moet  ook  baie  duidelik
wees dat die VF nie ten gunste is van korrupsie, of  van  bedrog  nie.  Daar
sal binnekort 'n hofsaak wees oor dié aangeleentheid waarin 'n agb  lid  van
hierdie Huis die aangeklaagde sal wees. Ons  sal  die  verloop  daarvan  met
belangstelling volg. Ek wil weer eens 'n beroep op die  agb  Minister  doen,
dat waar dit gaan oor  wapenaankope,  die  lede  van  die  weermag  bo  alle
verdenking moet wees.

Al  die  politieke  partye  in  hierdie  Huis  het  die  wapenaankopeprogram
aanvanklik gesteun. Dit is 'n werklikheid dat die wapentuig van die  weermag
in 'n vervalle toestand was. Daar moes nuwes aangekoop word. Daarom  sê  die
VF weer eens, ons sal die begrotingspos steun, maar ons is  nie  ten  gunste
van korrupsie en bedrog ten opsigte van die wapenaankope  nie.  (Translation
of Afrikaans declaration of vote follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, the National Defence Force has a task  to
fulfil. Its most important  task  is  maintaining  the  sovereignty  of  the
Republic of South Africa.

Unfortunately  the  weapons  transaction  has  created  a  negative   image.
Perceptions have arisen that the National Defence Force is corrupt and  that
all is not well. In reality it is not fair to lay  the  weapons  transaction
at the doorstep of the South African National Defence Force.

The FF will support this Vote, but we must make it very clear  that  the  FF
is not in favour of corruption or fraud. Soon there will be a court case  in
connection with this matter in which an hon member of  this  House  will  be
the accused. We will follow the course of  events  with  interest.  I  would
once again like to appeal to the  hon  the  Minister  that  as  far  as  the
purchase of weapons is concerned, the members of the  defence  force  should
be above suspicion.

Initially all the political parties in this House  supported  the  programme
for the purchase of weapons. It is a  reality  that  the  armaments  of  the
defence force were in a  very  poor  condition.  New  armaments  had  to  be
purchased. For that reason we in the  FF  say,  once  again,  that  we  will
support the Vote, but we are not in favour  of  corruption  and  fraud  with
regard to the purchase of weapons.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, one must,  in  fact,  agree  with  every  word
spoken by Mr Peter Groenewald. South Africa is the  only  country  that  has
undertaken as comprehensive a defence review as we have.

This House agreed to the equipping. It is also not absolutely true  that  we
have not taken steps to  ensure  that  every  piece  of  equipment  that  we
acquire is being trained for. We have different task teams in the  different
countries where we acquire equipment.

We must also make sure that as much as we scream and are  proud  of  the  SA
National Defence Force and the rescue people, in peace, we  should  also  be
proud to dig deep and provide.

We therefore must have a Defence Force  which  is  adequately  equipped,  we
must take our lead in Africa, we must make sure that we guard  our  borders,
and we must make sure that we protect life and limb.

The occurrences of 11 September make it very  clear  that  it  is  not  only
ignorant but also foolish of us to continue saying that  we  cannot  have  a
well-equipped Defence Force.

The ANC supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Vote No 22 - Independent Complaints Directorate - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mnr J J DOWRY: Mev die Speaker, agb lede,  ek  het  in  die  begrotingsdebat
genoem dat die Onafhanklike Klagtedirektoraat, OKD, nog  nie  tot  sy  volle
reg gekom het nie. Ek het verder  genoem  dat  hulle  ontsettend  belangrike
werk doen, en dat die eenheid ten  volle  deur  die  gemeenskap  benut  moet
word.

Hoewel die Nuwe NP ten gunste van die begrotingspos  gestem  het,  moet  dié
verklaring bygevoeg word: Ons het  kennis  geneem  van  'n  geval  waar  die
Nasionale Kommissaris van Polisie hom  met  die  werksaamhede  van  die  OKD
ingemeng het. Die Nuwe NP doen 'n beroep  op  die  Minister  om  sy  mag  en
posisie  te  gebruik  om  die  onafhanklikheid  van  die  OKD  te  verseker.
(Translation of Afrikaans declaration of vote follows.)

[Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, hon members, I mentioned in the Budget  debate
the fact that full  justice  has  not  yet  been  done  to  the  Independent
Complaints Directorate, the ICD. I further mentioned that they do  extremely
important  work,  and  that  the  unit  should  be  fully  utilised  by  the
community.

Although the New NP did not vote in favour of the Vote,  we  must  add  this
statement: We noted a case in which the National Commissioner of Police  had
interfered in the activities of the ICD. The New NP appeals to the  Minister
to use his power and position to ensure the independence of the ICD.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Madam Speaker, before I deal with what the  New  NP  said,  I
want to say that the ICD  is  meant  to  help  the  police  service  in  its
transformation programme, and to do that it must work with the  police,  not
against them. To deal with those individuals in the  service  who  sometimes
get out of line does not make them opponents of the service.

What the hon member says is unfortunate  because  he  is  speaking  about  a
statement that was made by the ICD, a statement that has  not  been  checked
with the National Commissioner. The last time the ICD was here, they made  a
statement which we said we would call the National  Commissioner  to  answer
to himself.

I have checked and verified that the statements made by the ICD against  the
National Commissioner are, in actual fact, not true, and  I  have  explained
this to the hon members. It is a pity that that is  used  as  a  declaration
against this Vote.

The ANC will support this Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 23 - Justice and Constitutional Development - put.

Declarations of vote:

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Speaker, the DP, on behalf of the DA,  supports  this
Vote.  In  doing  so,  we  wish  to  acknowledge  the  endeavours  of  those
individuals within the department who attempt  to  improve  the  functioning
thereof and, in particular, the determination of  the  national  prosecuting
authority to improve court functioning.

We also  note  the  various  steps  taken  to  address  aspects  which  are,
unfortunately, still lagging behind, such as the appointment  procedures  of
magistrates, legal aid and the chronic staff shortage.

However, serious shortcomings  exist  within  the  department.  One  is  the
failure of Government to use  instruments  available  to  it,  such  as  the
Public Protector and the Human Rights  Commission,  to  protect  the  public
from the terrible effects of bad  administration.  In  fact,  they  are  all
complaining of insufficient funds to fulfil their duties, and  the  question
we raise is: Is that deliberate action by Government?

The department's financial control is in a shocking state.  Ask  Scopa.  The
inexperience of prosecutors at all levels needs to  be  addressed  urgently.
The  disastrous  state  of  affairs  in  the  Department  of  Justice,  with
particular reference to its own national head office, needs to be resolved.

Mr M A MZIZI: Madam Speaker,  the  IFP  will  support  thie  Vote.  We  are,
however, concerned that the Maintenance Act is not being fully  implemented.
There is an insufficient funding to employ  the  tracing  agents  needed  to
find the defaulters and serve them with  the  necessary  documentation  that
will force them to appear  before  maintenance  officers.  This  results  in
people that rely on the maintenance money and really need it not  benefiting
from it.

We therefore urge the  Minister  to  look  into  this  matter  and  speedily
resolve this problem, though we know that the Minister did make  mention  of
of the fact that the matter is receiving attention. However, I do not  think
that the matter should only receive attention, but that we should  also  see
this taking off the ground.

We will remember that this Act was passed sometime  in  1998.  I  think  the
then Deputy Minister is now the Minister of Health. She was pioneering  this
project. We think that this will be speedily done.

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, this year  the  New  NP  is  supporting  the
Budget, because this year, for the first time in some years, we  have  heard
of some improvement in the department's problem  areas.  These  include  the
low conviction rate delays, overloaded court  rolls,  inadequate  facilities
and security at courts leading to the still negative perception  the  public
has of the criminal justice system.

There is an impressive attempt to get  to  grips  with  years  of  financial
mismanagement,  although  this  has  not  yet  been  turned   around.   Only
yesterday, stories of R1,5 million worth  of  computer  equipment  purchased
but gathering dust at head  office  hit  the  headlines,  and  the  Auditor-
General has, once again, condemned the department as one of the three  worst
run of all.

Because of budgetary constraints, the  department's  disciplinary  processes
are also adversely inadequate to cope with the  dishonest  practices  which,
in the words of the Minister's spokesperson, are rife in the department.

However, there are some  impressive  centres  of  excellence,  such  as  the
national prosecuting authority,  which  bears  testimony  to  what  adequate
resourcing can do for the inherent talent that resides in the Department  of
Justice. We therefore urge the Minister  to  pursue  his  goal  of  adequate
resourcing  for  his  department,  and  we  support  the  Vote  with   those
reservations.

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, justice requires that society  deals  seriously
and firmly with crime, recognising that it is as  much  an  offence  against
persons as it is against the state, and that it is as much  a  violation  of
the victim as it is a violation of the law.

Whilst the ACDP will support this Vote and has  commended  the  DG  and  his
team for a vastly improved financial report, there  is  clearly  still  much
room for improvement.

The CFO Mr Mackenzie has stated that, and I quote -


  ... the MTEF allocation  reflects  a  scarcity  of  funding,  and  better
  management of available funding is thus critical.

Of greater concern is his admission that, and I quote -


  ... the legacy systems and processes are not coping ...

And in the case of the  deposit  account,  in  which  moneys  in  trust  are
administered  on  behalf  of  the  public,  contingent  losses   have   been
acknowledged   as   nonquantifiable.   If   the   contingent   losses    are
nonquantifiable, how will one begin to determine the amount  that  has  been
lost due to fraud, theft or corruption? It seems to be  a  case  of  getting
close to knowing what we do not know.

Whilst I fully appreciate that many of the systems were inherited,  the  CFO
statement that, and I quote, ``taken as  a  whole,  the  management  of  the
deposit account has collapsed'', is a very serious admission.

The deplorable condition of many of the  magistrates'  courts,  particularly
in the former homelands and townships, is obviously a matter of concern  and
will require major  capital  expenditure  in  many  cases.  This  issue  was
highlighted by the Deputy  Minister  and  the  Chief  Justice  in  a  recent
submission to the portfolio  committee.  Inasmuch  as  human  resources  are
concerned, the CFO further stated that whilst  across-the-board  pockets  of
excellence exist, fundamental problems still remain.

However, it would be remiss of us to forget  the  loyal  dedication  of  the
departmental staff, judiciary and prosecutors in addressing  court  backlogs
by means of  Saturday  and  additional  courts.  Without  these  courts  the
backlog would be more severe. The ACDP will accordingly support this  Budget
Vote.

Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and gentlemen,  I  rise
on behalf of the ANC in  unconditional  support  of  this  Budget  Vote.  Of
course, it is a very exciting day for me. I look at the speakers'  list  and
where it says ``Declarations of vote'' there are only  four  parties,  where
it says ``Objections'' there is no  one,  and  where  it  says  ``Division''
there is no one. It is so exciting. I think it  is  a  historic  event  that
this Budget Vote is going through without anyone objecting.

The SPEAKER: Hon member, I would not provoke the parties, please.

Adv J H DE LANGE: No, Madam Speaker, I am just testing their resolve. I  can
see they stand by their principles. So I am very excited, and I  stand  with
such a blossoming and happy heart today, and there is  very  little  to  say
... [Interjections.] And a haircut. [Laughter.]
Let me say it is a lot of hard work that got us to this day on which  we  do
not have anyone objecting to this Vote or calling for a division.  There  is
no doubt that there are enormous problems in our justice system.

Mr M J ELLIS: My colleagues are getting soft.

Adv J H DE LANGE: That hon member's  colleagues  are  getting  soft,  but  I
think what is happening is that common sense is prevailing on that  side  at
last. [Interjections.] While common sense still prevails,  I  will  try  and
make my point.

I do think it is a lot of hard work. Firstly, it is hard work  in  terms  of
creating a  new  financial  management  system  which  is  starting  to  pay
dividends, and, secondly, I think it is also paying  dividends  through  the
leadership in the department  in  the  different  business  units  which  is
starting to understand the vision of  where  the  department  is  going  and
trying to implement that vision.

I think those are the two issues that have changed -  the  creation  of  new
systems and the fact that their leadership structures are starting to  stand
up to be counted for what they are doing. We, of course, will help them  and
watch them closely, and hopefully next year we will even be able to  give  a
better report and keep our record clean with no objections and divisions.

I want to thank all the other parties for having such good common  sense  to
vote with the ANC unconditionally for this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, despite the provocation, we will not object  to
this Vote. [Laughter.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 24 - Safety and Security - put.

Declaration of vote:

Adv P S SWART: Madam Speaker, the  late  Minister  of  Safety  and  security
always claimed to be serious about crime. When he on 18 May 2000  stated  in
this House that, and I quote, ``the year 2002 will see  South  Africa's  own
renaissance in our fight  against  crime'',  3  888  out  of  every  100 000
citizens had been victims of crime in 1999. But then this  figure  increased
to 4 000 for 1999 and 2000, the highest ever.

The SA Police Service is serious about crime, as reflected  in  this  year's
breakdown in the programmes of its budget, with greater  emphasis  on  crime
prevention, visible policing and its strategic planning. We salute them  for
that.

The National Commissioner is serious about crime.  At  the  budget  hearings
late in 2001 he requested  more  police  officers.  He  needs  38 000,  with
proper resources to stabilise crime in 340 of our 1 100 police areas -  just
to stabilise crime. He got 16 000 staggered over three years for  the  4 084
people out of every 100 000 who were victims of crime in 2001.
The people of this country are serious about  crime.  Every  poll  indicates
that unemployment and crime are always above any  other  concerns  in  their
minds. Crime figures are the only real indicators as to our success in  this
fight as, for some bizarre reason, Cabinet decided to deny us access to  the
latest statistics, leaving us to rely on the available figures.

But then,  as  to  the  bigger  picture,  we  are  not  persuaded  that  the
executive, as a collective, is serious enough  about  crime,  not  when  the
National Commissioner's needs go  unheeded,  but  there  is  money  for  tax
relief of R15 million and billions and billions for  the  second  and  third
phase of the arms deal.

We in the DA, like all the people of this country, are serious about  crime,
and the DP cannot support a budget that is insufficient to bring crime  down
and see to the safety and security needs of all our people.

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker and hon members, crime  is  the  responsibility
of the police, therefore it is the primary role that the  police  should  be
focusing on. In order  to  do  that,  the  police  must  have  enough  human
resources  to  deal  with  that  matter.  Therefore  the   recruitment   and
employment  drive  that  the  department  has  embarked  on,  including  the
directive from the President, will improve the human  resources  within  the
police.

The most important part that the  police  should  be  looking  into  is  the
investigation part. The police should investigate cases,  and  cases  should
not be thrown out of court because they were not investigated thoroughly  or
because of the poor quality of the investigation.

The third issue I want  to  talk  about  is  corruption  within  the  Police
Service. I do applaud the department for doing everything that it  has  done
to clamp down on corruption, especially on corrupt  police  officers  within
the department.

I know that in KwaZulu-Natal about 19 police officers have been arrested  in
Mountain Rise Police Station in Pietermaritzburg  as  a  result  of  corrupt
acts such as stealing  petrol  and  other  things  from  the  department.  I
applaud the police for that, and I want them to be even more  harsh  to  the
police, because the police have to maintain law, not break it.

Lastly, I appeal to the department  to  look  after  the  widows  of  police
officers, because their spouses are  mostly  killed  in  the  line  of  duty
because someone wanted to steal their guns, property and so on. It could  be
better understood if the widows of police officers were looked after  by  an
association of widows of police officers, and if the  department  made  sure
that it serviced such an association by, for instance,  making  available  a
social worker or a psychologist to look after these widows.

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam  Speaker,  whenever  South  Africans  are  asked  to
mention which of the issues facing them concern  them  the  most,  crime  is
always at the top of their list. It is  very  unfortunate  that  people  who
love this country  of  their  birth  have  to  live  in  fear  of  criminals
regardless of where they live or where they find themselves.

South Africans are attacked,  robbed,  hijacked  and  murdered  on  a  daily
basis. Not even children in school are safe any more, or  even  babies  that
are still in their mothers' wombs. No place on the  South  African  soil  is
respected by criminals. Safety and security is not  guaranteed  to  anybody,
regardless of where they live or work.

The ACDP holds this Government responsible for this  unacceptable  state  of
affairs. Until Government agrees to punish criminals  and  teach  them  that
crime does not pay, the ACDP will not support the Safety and  Security  Vote
No 24. We call on Government to put the constitutional right to security  of
the person at the top  of  their  priority  list  and  make  this  beautiful
country the safest country on this continent by eradicating crime.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev Speaker, die agb Minister is nie  lank  'n  Minister
nie, en die gevolg is dat  hy  sit  so  'n  bietjie  met  erfsondes  van  sy
voorganger. Die werklikheid  is  dat  volgens  inligting  aan  die  FF  daar
gisteraand alleen in 'n voorstad van Pretoria soos  Elarduspark  nie  minder
as vyf motorkapings plaasgevind het nie.

Die agb Minister het by sy aanstelling bekendgemaak dat die misdaad in Suid-
Afrika nie hoër is as in ander lande nie. Ek wil aan  die  agb  Minister  'n
uitnodiging rig. Ek wil hom vra om minstens twee weke lank  in  Johannesburg
te gaan rondstap, maar sonder sy lyfwagte. Hy moet nie sy  lyfwagte  saamvat
nie. Dan sal hy  miskien  agterkom  wat  die  misdaadvlakke  in  Suid-Afrika
werklik is. Dit is onaanvaarbaar.

Die ander aspek is dat die FF die enigste politieke  party  is  wat  ook  'n
dokument ingehandig het by die kommissie wat plaasmoorde ondersoek.  Hierdie
kommissie se bevindings sou al verlede jaar bekendgemaak gewees het.  Op  'n
amptelike vraag van my aan die agb Minister het hy verlede Maart  geantwoord
dat die oorsake van en die motiewe vir plaasmoorde  reeds  bekend  is,  maar
dit word nie openbaar gemaak nie.

So lank as hierdie motiewe en oorsake nie bekendgemaak word nie,  asook  die
hoë totale  vlak  van  misdaad  in  Suid-Afrika,  kan  die  VF  nie  hierdie
begrotingspos ondersteun nie. (Translation of Afrikaans declaration of  vote
follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, the hon Minister has not been a  minister
for long and the result is that he is now saddled with  a  bit  of  original
sin from his predecessor. According to information  made  available  to  the
FF, the reality is that last night alone, in a suburb of  Pretoria  such  as
Elardus Park, no fewer than five car hijackings took place.

The hon the Minister announced with his  appointment  that  crime  in  South
Africa is no higher than it is in other countries. I would  like  to  extend
an invitation to the hon the Minister. I want to ask him to walk  around  in
Johannesburg for at least two weeks, but without his bodyguards.  He  should
not take his bodyguards along. Then perhaps he will realise  what  the  real
levels of crime are in South Africa. It is unacceptable.

The other aspect is that the FF is the only political party which handed  in
a document to the commission investigating farm  murders.  The  findings  of
this commission would have been published last year already. On an  official
question from me to the hon the Minister he answered  last  March  that  the
causes of and the motives for farm murders are already known,  but  that  it
is not made public.

As long as these motives and causes are  not  published  as  well  the  high
level of crime in South Africa, the FF cannot support this budget vote.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Madam Speaker, I want to address my inputs to the  statements
made by the ACDP and the FF. I am very concerned about the fact  that  South
Africans could go out of their  way  to  give  a  negative  image  of  their
country. What they are saying here is very far from the truth.

I am the first one to accept, and I would repeat  and  emphasise,  that  the
police have done a lot of work to bring down the levels of crime,  something
these parties do not appreciate. We must also  accept  that  the  levels  of
crime in this country are still unacceptably high - we  do  not  deny  that.
But the impression must not be created that nothing is  being  done.  A  lot
has been done. Many crimes have been stabilised and  in  actual  fact  there
are even moves to bring some of the crimes down.

The National Commissioner and his team are doing everything to fight  crime.
When the  Minister  addressed  us  for  the  first  time  in  the  portfolio
committee, he gave us  a  vision  which  also  shows  that  he  is  just  as
committed as the police to  bringing  the  levels  of  crime  down  in  this
country. Looking at the vision of  the  Minister  of  Safety  and  Security,
Comrade Charles, it is very clear that there is a plan  to  fight  crime  in
this country. This is a matter of concern for all of us, and that is  why  I
have been pleading with these gentlemen on my left not to turn crime into  a
political football. It is a serious challenge facing our new democracy.

Some of them  brought  the  question  of  the  arms  deal  into  Safety  and
Security. That is ridiculous. What has Safety and Security to  do  with  the
arms deal?

Now that the Minister of Finance is here, I just want to  say  that  we  are
thankful for the increase in the department's budget. But, as  many  members
have said, the budget is not  adequate  to  address  the  challenges  facing
Safety and Security.

The SPEAKER: Hon member, having made your plea, you must conclude,  as  your
time for a declaration has expired.

Mr M E GEORGE: What the Minister has done is welcome  and  we  support  this
budget. [Time expired.]

Vote agreed  to  (Democratic  Party,  African  Christian  Democratic  Party,
Federal Alliance and Freedom Front dissenting).

Vote No 25 - Agriculture - agreed to.

Vote No 26 - Communications - put.

Declarations of vote:

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, when we conducted the Communications Budget  Vote
debate here on 7 May, we did so without having had a presentation  from  the
department or an opportunity to ask  for  explanations  in  answer  to  such
questions as the following: Why is only R111 million being voted  for  Icasa
in a year when the regulator is expected to  conduct  the  serial  licensing
procedure for the second fixed-line  operator?  It  is  simply  not  enough.
Where is the benefit of all the consultants hired by the department?  It  is
simply too much.

We accept that the funeral of the late hon Minister Steve Tshwete  made  the
scheduled budget presentation difficult, but  we  were  promised  a  session
with the department before the actual vote today and we  have  not  had  it.
Now that in itself is unacceptable.
The reason why the department is so distracted is also the other reason  why
we voted against this budget. Its latest  legislative  exercise,  much  like
the flip-flop Telecommunications Amendment Act last year, is turning into  a
fiasco. The Internet law contains chapters of  sheer  sci-fi  fantasy  which
bear little relation to actual Internet technology.

On the subject of fantasy, I must advise hon  members  that  the  ZA  domain
primary zone file is not, in fact, hidden on  a  gunnery  platform  off  the
English coast, as SATV speculated in an unusually  bizarre  news  item  last
night. Whoever told the SABC so is  functioning  on  the  wilder  shores  of
fantasy. One has a suspicion of who, in fact, told them.  Let  me  tell  the
hon Kekana that it is not on the gunnery platform ...  [Interjections.]  ...
and someone is  functioning  on  the  wilder  shores  of  fantasy.  This  is
seriously worrying.

It is time to bring South Africa back to reality or we will be in trouble.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, although the ACDP supports  this  Budget  Vote,
we do so with reservations because we are concerned about the  treatment  of
Christian community radio stations by Icasa. Icasa has made every effort  to
put obstacles in the way and to harass local community and  Christian  radio
stations. Registration has been  held  up  for  years,  in  many  cases.  In
others, licences have been removed and all kinds of obstacles have been  put
in the way. Taxpayers' money is wasted on long-drawn-out  court  cases  only
because Icasa has a bigger budget to litigate.

The victimisation of Christian community radio  stations  must  come  to  an
end. We cannot vote in favour year after year for the fat salaries of  Icasa
councillors while those very councillors are hostile to Christian  community
radio stations  -  not  because  their  programmes  are  inadequate  or  the
management of these stations is poor or they do  not  have  public  support,
but because they are predominantly Christian.

We commend Radio Tygerberg and Radio CCFM  and  all  other  Christian  radio
stations for the sterling work they have done.

Mr N N KEKANA: Madam Speaker, I am really surprised at  the  position  taken
by Mr Green. First of all community radio stations need to be informed  that
the hon member has not been attending meetings this year, so he is not in  a
position to even comment about the budget of the department.

The DP will always be the way they are. The DP should be ashamed  of  itself
for supporting anarchy  and  instability  regarding  the  Internet  in  this
country. The DP, together with Mr Lawrie, is  creating  uncertainty.  It  is
important, for  the  record,  to  state  that  the  dot-za  is  not  private
intellectual property. It belongs to all South Africans, and the  same  goes
for the Internet. It is very important for us to do so. [Applause.]

What we  want  is  a  domain  name  and  allocation  system  that  is  open,
transparent and representative. We have stated this. The Bill also says  so.
[Applause.]

The ANC supports this Budget Vote. The ANC is confident that  the  director-
general, under  the  political  leadership  of  the  Minister,  is  doing  a
sterling job in contributing to skills development in the country.  The  ANC
is confident that as a country  we  are  benefiting  from  the  roll-out  of
Telkom and from what the SABC is trying to do. Of course there  is  still  a
lot of improvement that needs to be done.

The ANC is confident that Icasa is delivering in as far as  community  radio
stations are concerned. There has to be a  balance  between  communities  of
interest and geographic communities as far as radio stations are  concerned.
We are confident that the department is doing a sterling job and we  support
this Vote. [Applause.]

Vote No 27 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, the department has allocated R80 million  in
2002-03 for the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development.  There  must  be
something that can be gained by the local people, especially the  previously
disadvantaged, such  as  the  chance  to  exhibit  their  wares,  access  to
employment opportunities and wider representation through co-operatives  and
NGOs. The amount to  be  paid  by  the  co-operatives  and  NGOs  for  their
exhibitions is too expensive. We appeal to the Minister to use some of  this
allocated amount to help these poor communities and disadvantaged people  to
exhibit.

Another issue is the fishing quotas, which leave much to be desired  as  far
as the previously disadvantaged communities are  concerned.  We  acknowledge
the fishing rights that have been allocated to  the  22  commercial  fishing
sectors for the period of four years. We suggest some kind  of  rotation  to
prevent monopolisation  and  the  denial  of  internal  access  to  emerging
fishermen.

Vote agreed to (Democratic Party dissenting).
Vote No 28 - Labour - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Madam Speaker, the Department of Labour  has  worked
hard  this  year  and  produced  some  pleasing  results.  The  Compensation
Commission has improved measurably, The Setas are  receiving  due  attention
and intervention where necessary  and  the  inspections  of  workplaces  are
rooting out child labour. All of these are pluses.

But, as I said in the debate last month to  the  Minister,  the  cold,  hard
fact is that unskilled workers are so expensive that everyone who is in  the
job creation  business  will  do  anything  to  avoid  hiring  more  people.
Frankly, the facts are against the Minister. Seven  million  South  Africans
are today unemployed. Almost half of these people are younger  than  30  and
almost 90% of them do not possess any skills or training  for  any  kind  of
job. The labour law amendments were a step in the right  direction,  and  we
will give the Minister credit for this, but we still need  a  radical,  far-
reaching overhaul to create jobs for our people.

The Department and the Ministry of Labour  have  many  important  roles  and
responsibilities, some of which it is dealing with very  well,  and  all  of
which pale into insignificance when pitted against the need  to  provide  an
economic environment conducive to investment and job creation.

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, the New NP supports this Budget  Vote.  We  want
to congratulate the Minister on the good work that he is  doing.  But,  like
me, he has got no hair on his head, and so I cannot ruffle his hair.

Employment creation is still the biggest problem facing this Government  and
the key instrument for fighting poverty. If we want  to  fight  poverty  and
ensure economic growth we need to educate and train more  workers,  because,
while joblessness is on the rise, the most noticeable change in  the  labour
market is an increased demand for skilled workers.

If the unemployed remain unemployable, then  South  Africa  is  heading  for
serious economic problems. Because of high unemployment crime is  increasing
daily. When people are unemployed  they  have  the  option  of  starving  or
stealing.

Crime and corruption are crippling our society and only  contribute  to  the
bad impression that investors have of our country. However, we  support  the
Budget Vote.

Mr R M MOROPA:  Madam  Speaker,  while  we  understand  that  the  issue  of
unemployment is a challenge to this country, through our efforts as  members
of this Parliament we should be able to  come  up  with  measures  that  can
address that issue. We, as the ANC,  fully  support  the  Minister's  Budget
Vote, because we understand that this budget is not a standalone budget.  It
is a budget that is taking forward the work of previous years' budgets.

We also understand that this budget provides the department  with  a  unique
opportunity to play a pivotal role  in  ensuring  labour-absorbing  economic
growth. The budget convincingly attempts to  undo  a  deeply  fractured  and
disintegrated national skills profile and  conversely  replaces  it  with  a
national skills profile that reflects the demographics of our South  African
population as provided for in our Reconstruction and Development Programme.

The budget not only adheres to our  political  imperatives  but  also  gives
impetus to an effective macroeconomic  strategy.  It  is  this  budget  that
clearly outlines the  commitments  of  the  department  against  which  this
year's performance of the department  will  be  measured.  I  therefore,  on
behalf of the ANC,  declare  our  unconditional  support  for  Vote  No  28.
[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, the ACDP supports the  Budget  Vote,  but  we
would like to  highlight  the  following.  Unemployment  is  still  a  major
concern for everyone,  And  the  low  skills  level  is  one  of  the  major
problems, especially in a modern economy such as ours. I would like to  call
upon the Minister to look for creative ways to stimulate the utilisation  of
the Skills Development Fund, because both the private and the public  sector
are guilty in this regard.

I am still curious to hear the Minister implement what  was  raised  by  the
President of this country at some stage when he called for  a  reduction  of
labour costs without reducing wages. I am still curious to  know  what  that
means - reduction of labour costs without reducing wages. I have  not  heard
the Minister address that issue. He seemed to  be  calling  for  some  major
magic formula to do that.

But I would like to say that it is not good to  clamour  about  unemployment
and slow growth when we are doing nothing  to  help  skills  development.  I
think those who are calling for  unemployment  to  be  addressed  should  do
something about skills development. So, as far as  that  is  concerned,  the
Minister was correct when  he  said  skills  development  is  the  issue  in
addressing unemployment. But I am still curious to hear  from  the  Minister
about that formula of the President.

Vote agreed to (Democratic Party dissenting.)
Vote No 29 - Land Affairs - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr A J BOTHA: Madam Speaker, the DP is aware that the  DA  is  very  pleased
that there are many more members of  Cabinet  present  here  today  than  is
customary when Land Affairs and Agriculture are debated in this House.

Hierdie belangeloosheid van die Kabinetslede  wanneer  die  landboubegroting
bespreek word, is werklik vreemd. Dit is vreemd, want  die  Regering,  sowel
as die ANC verseker ons dat hulle die landbou baie  belangrik  ag.  Nietemin
skiet die bedrae tekort wat hierdie lede toestaan vir  die  landbou  om  aan
hulle  eie  grondhervormingsdoelwitte  te  voldoen.  Net  om  die   gestelde
doelwitte te behaal, moet daar elke jaar  ten  minste  1,5  miljoen  hektaar
aangekoop word. Die bedrae wat hiervoor  toegestaan  word,  is  hopeloos  te
laag. Die onafwendbare mislukking van die program sal dan nie  opgelos  word
deur ander te blameer of uit te kryt as tweedeklasburgers nie. Dit  sal  ook
sekerlik nie opgelos word deur die agb  Oosthuizen  se  bombastiese  oproepe
tot vaderlandsliefde nie. Sonder dat dit enigsins reflekteer op die  persoon
van die agb Oosthuizen, sal dit hom tog loon om ag  te  slaan  op  dié  wyse
woorde: ``Patriotism is the last refuge of a  scoundrel.''  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This lack of interest by the Cabinet members when  the  agriculture  budget
is discussed, is really strange. It is strange because  the  Government,  as
well as the ANC, ensure  us  that  they  consider  agriculture  to  be  very
important.  Nonetheless,  the  amounts  which  these   members   grant   for
agriculture to meet their own land reform objectives, fall short.  In  order
merely to meet the set objectives, at least 1,5  million  hectares  must  be
purchased every year. The amounts granted for this  purpose  are  hopelessly
too low. The inevitable failure of the programme will then not be solved  by
blaming  others  or  denouncing  them  as  second-class  citizens.  It  will
certainly also not be solved by the hon Oosthuizen's appeals  for  bombastic
patriotism.  Without  it  reflecting  in  any  way  on  the  hon  Oosthuizen
personally, it would benefit him to heed these  wise  words:  Patriotism  is
the last refuge of a scoundrel.'']

Good  government  delivers,  bad  government  blames.  Bombastic  calls  for
patriotism will not deliver land reform.  Sufficient  funds  to  enable  the
people in the departments to do their work can deliver land reform.  The  DA
implores the Cabinet to give them the funds  to  enable  them  to  do  their
work. [Interjections.]

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Madam Speaker, I stand  here  on  behalf  of  the  ANC  to
support the Budget Vote. It is one of the most  important  budget  votes  in
the process of the democratisation and transformation  of  our  country  and
addressing the question of poverty. We therefore support it.

Secondly, the department has committed itself to  ensuring  that,  within  a
period of  three  years,  we  see  drastic  changes  in  the  land  reforms.
Therefore we support this Vote.

In his speech, the chairperson of the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Agriculture
and Land Affairs did indicate  that  for  this  department  to  be  able  to
effectively carry out its enormous task, the Ministry in Treasury  may  have
to consider the adjustment of this Budget. We therefore support this  Budget
Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 30 - Minerals and Energy - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, the ACDP supports the budget, but  has  serious
reservations with regard to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources  Development
Bill. In this industry investments are so large, payback time  so  long  and
the costs of prospecting so heavy that no matter  how  good  the  intentions
are, creating doubts will destroy it, as has been the case in Zambia,  where
mines were nationalised in 1974. The industry was  destroyed  and  today  no
one wants those mines.
Anyone can own shares in a mine, and to categorise mines as black  or  white
in terms of major investors is insulting to workers and shareholders  alike.
In the absence of bankable rights, both foreign participation and  entry  by
operators with limited capital resources will  be  constrained.  Prospecting
and  mining  activities  in  South  Africa   will   be   reduced   and   the
attractiveness  of  South  Africa  as  an  investment  destination  may   be
impaired.

Continuity of tenure for existing rights holders and security of  tenure  in
future are cornerstones of a successful state-custody mineral rights  system
and should be reflected explicitly in the legislation.

There is also  a  need  for  objective  criteria  in  the  Act  to  regulate
administrative discretion with regard to  access  to  the  industry.  Mining
houses are concerned that the conversion process does not give a  watertight
guarantee  that  existing  mines  will  continue  to   operate   under   new
legislation. This  will  impact  on  the  ability  to  plan  long  term  and
negatively affect the company  and  the  state  with  regard  to  generating
revenue.

Without certainty around the  life  of  mine  tenure,  long-term  investment
decisions will be compromised. Mines in South Africa employ  many  thousands
of people. Their families and the towns and communities that have  grown  up
around these mines depend,  for  their  livelihoods,  on  the  uninterrupted
operation of the mines.

The Bill as it stands  introduces  various  uncertainties  around  continued
operations, thereby threatening mining  companies  and  those  directly  and
indirectly dependent on them. Joint venture and empowerment partnerships  to
which mining houses contribute may also be in jeopardy. The  ACDP  suppports
this Bill, but with these reservations.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, dit is nie aanvaarbaar vir die  VF  dat
'n enkele amptenaar kan  bepaal  wat  die  trustbedrag  moet  wees  vir  die
herwinning van die omgewing nadat 'n myn se leeftyd verby  is  nie.  Dit  is
nie aanvaarbaar vir die VF dat 'n enkele amptenaar kan besluit of 'n  sekere
lisensie vir delf toegestaan word of nie  toegestaan  word  nie.  Daar  moet
beter prosedures in plek kom. Die eenvoudigheid is: Daar is gevalle waar  'n
lisensie aan mense binne enkele dae toegestaan word, terwyl ander  mense  se
aansoeke om te delf etlike maande al by die kantoor is  en  nie  aandag  kry
nie. Alvorens hierdie  korrupsie  nie  behoorlik  aangespreek  word  in  die
Departement  van  Minerale  en  Energie  nie,  kan  die   VF   nie   hierdie
begrotingspos steun nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  declaration  of  vote
follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, it is not acceptable to the FF  that  one
official  can  determine  the  trust  amount  for  the  reclamation  of  the
environment after the lifespan of a mine is over. It is  not  acceptable  to
the FF that one official can decide whether a certain licence for mining  is
granted or not. Better procedures should  be  put  into  place.  The  simple
truth is: There are cases in which a licence is granted to people  within  a
few days, while other people's applications for  mining  have  been  at  the
office for several months without being considered. Before  this  corruption
is properly dealt with in the Department  of  Minerals  and  Energy  the  FF
cannot support this Vote.]

Mr T M GONIWE: Madam Speaker, the ANC supports this Budget Vote because  the
mandate given to the ANC by the overwhelming majority of South Africans  was
to ensure that the mineral resources of our country,  the  heritage  of  our
people, would be restored to them.

Central to the restoration of this heritage to the people  is  the  need  to
ensure that these are developed sustainably for the  benefit  of  all  South
Africans, that the minerals and energy industries are deracialised and  made
to benefit the entire nation and that energy is available  to  industry  and
households, especially poor households.

This Government has striven, since the advent  of  democracy,  to  transform
the minerals and energy sectors to achieve these objectives. The  Department
of Minerals and Energy  has,  through  painstaking  work,  made  significant
strides towards the transformation  of  all  aspects  of  the  minerals  and
energy industry in its entirety. Part of these fruits of the  hard  work  of
this department will be seen next Tuesday as  they  will  come  to  fruition
when this  august  House  debates  and  passes  the  Mineral  and  Petroleum
Resources Development Bill.

This Bill will change the landscape of ownership  patterns  and  bring  into
being a  new  transparent  and  accountable  regulatory  framework,  thereby
promoting equitable access and bringing the industry in line with  the  rest
of the world. The ANC supports this Bill. When the rights  were  taken  away
from our people, they were never allowed to make  speeches  and  submissions
and issue press releases. The ANC will restore those rights to our people  -
the rightful owners. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Vote agreed  to  (Democratic  Party,  Freedom  Front  and  Federal  Alliance
dissenting).

Vote No 31 - Trade and Industry - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr N S BRUCE: Madam Speaker, as you can see, I speak for the poor people  in
the rural areas of this country  ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  [Interjections]  ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  as  do  my
colleagues on the left, as they explained, and my future colleagues  sitting
over there, who are going to join us tomorrow. [Interjections.]

A Ministry may have the most brilliant or effective policies  aimed  at  the
greatest public good, but they are as sounding brass if  it  does  not  also
have  a  department  that  is  able  to  implement  them  expeditiously  and
effectively. For at least the past three years, Trade and Industry has  been
in a process of turbulent reorganisation. Not doubt progress has been  made.
It now answers two out of every three telephone calls. Of  course,  this  is
real progress.

But the DTI is in the serious investment game. It is not playing in a  dress
rehearsal; it is already playing in the big league. It is usually the  first
contact a new investor or aspirant entrepreneur has  with  the  bureaucratic
jungle that it is constantly enlarging. If it is not seen  to  be  efficient
right from the first contact, it can innocently  destroy,  in  the  eyes  of
international investors, whatever confidence they  had  here,  just  as  the
dreadful Mineral and Petroleum  Resources  Development  Bill  we  have  just
referred to is doing at the moment - a Bill which has Bob Mugabeism  written
all over it and which will certainly stifle investment in this country.

Policy is only as good as its instrument of implementation. If the  Minister
has a flawed means of implementation at his disposal, he might as well  have
a flawed policy. A better  life  for  all  hangs  on  a  tenuous  thread  of
operational efficiency. This department has to be evaluated on  the  outcome
of  its  policy  implementation.  That,  as  I  understand  it,  is   rising
investment  and  increasing  jobs,  neither  of  which  has  been  achieved.
[Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, the IFP will support the  Trade  and  Industry
Budget Vote. During the readings we have  given  our  support  also  to  the
Minister and the director-general, and we have been very happy with the  way
things have been conducted at the Department of Trade and Industry.

The director-general has shown that he has the ability to move forward  with
this department. What was interesting was the hearings that we had in  terms
of this debate, particularly on industrial policy. I think there are  a  lot
of positive moves for the future. Of course, we will  not  agree  with  each
and every small item - one can never  have  everything  -  but,  in  general
terms, the IFP will support this Vote.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, the ACDP  congratulates  the  Minister  on  the
excellent job that has been done in Trade and Industry as a whole.

We must, however, register the strongest objections in terms  of  Government
policy on gambling. Exploitation of the poor is  not  acceptable  under  any
name, and lotteries and casinos are no exceptions. Gambling  has  proven  to
be unprofitable and cannot be defended in terms of benefiting  the  economy.
The revenue-raising ability for provinces was used as a carrot  to  con  the
public into thinking vast amounts would be spent to alleviate  poverty.  The
reality, however, is that poverty has increased  and  organisations  working
to alleviate suffering receive little or no assistance.

The budgets for gambling boards total R127 million. CEO packages range  from
R200 000 to nearly R900 000 and chairmen's packages from R12 000  to  nearly
R700 000. How is this  value  for  money?  The  promised  tax  take  is,  in
reality, extremely poor, social  costs  astronomical  and  regulatory  costs
exorbitant.

The gambling industry exploits people's weaknesses  and  undermines  efforts
towards moral regeneration. This new  culture  promotes  greed  and  instant
gratification and  undermines  the  need  to  study,  family  life,  delayed
consumption and frugality. Gambling is a direct attack  on  the  family  and
fosters prostitution, money-laundering, gangsterism, drugs and liquor -  all
industries which negatively impact on the spread of HIV/Aids and on law  and
order.
The ACDP calls for a stop to this lunacy. At the very least there must be  a
moratorium until further assessment can be  done  on  how  the  industry  is
impacting South Africa. While we will not  vote  against  the  budget  as  a
whole, the ACDP has serious reservations in terms of gambling.

Now, to answer the hon the Minister who wanted to know if  I  was  going  to
stop talking about sex: When the Government stops  funding  operations  that
target our children with filth, then I will not need  to  bring  it  to  the
Government's attention. [Interjections.] Until they  repent  and  turn  from
their wicked ways, they will hear from me. God loves them too much to  leave
them the way they are.

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Speaker, the Portfolio Committee on Trade and  Industry
interacted very extensively on the budget  this  year.  A  report  which  we
published in the ATC on 13 May recorded progress  in  financial  management,
progress in aligning the department's programmes to its budget, progress  in
ensuring  that  resources  allocated  are  actually  deployed,  progress  in
reporting on output targets and - I ask Mr Bruce to take note - progress  in
administrative efficiency, as reflected, for example, in the fact  that  the
time it takes to register a company has been reduced from 21 days  to  three
days. I am afraid that, as usual, Mr Bruce has presented us with  a  lot  of
fatuous nonsense.

As for the ACDP, I want to remind them that they are not the only  ones  who
are concerned about the adverse social impact of gambling,  particularly  on
the poor. It is precisely for that reason that the Government has opted  for
a path  of  strict  regulation  and  why  we  engage  significantly  on  the
effectiveness of those regulations with the department from  time  to  time.
The problem with the ACDP is that they do not spell out  their  alternative.
They appear to  support  prohibition  without  telling  us  how  they  would
enforce it without driving the industry underground  in  the  way  it  would
only exacerbate the negative impacts on the poor.

The ANC will support this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to (Democratic Party and Federal Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 32 - Transport - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, I notice that our Minister is  not  here,  but
maybe the Minister of Finance can take note of what I  want  to  say.  There
are four major anomalies, by my judgment,  in  the  budget.  The  first  one
relates to the lack of adequate funds to effectively  start  addressing  the
backlog in the maintenance of our  roads  nationally,  provincially  and  at
local level. Despite sterling  efforts  by  the  SA  National  Roads  Agency
Limited to keep our national roads as well maintained as possible,  and  the
fact that new toll roads  are  operating  well,  it  is  imperative  that  a
dedicated road  fund  be  established  in  order  to  allocate  funds  on  a
proportional and conditional basis back to provinces and local government.

This is essential if we seriously  want  to  ensure  that  these  roads  are
improved,  maintained  and  developed.  Until   this   happens,   the   road
maintenance backlog will not decline. To further  toll  nontoll  roads  will
put a further burden and hardship on local communities.

The second aspect relates to the underfunding of  rail  infrastructure.  The
SARCC faces financial crisis unless more funds are urgently  allocated,  and
the rail commuting public face the  possibility  of  cutbacks  on  services,
high risks to safety and security and, above  all,  the  potential  of  more
accidents occurring due to systems failure. More funds are  urgently  needed
to address this pending crisis, particularly if we are to be  serious  about
moving commuters and goods from road to rail.

The third aspect of concern is the  inequality  of  subsidies  to  the  taxi
industry, when one takes  into  consideration  that  60%  of  South  African
travelling commuters use taxis, yet only limited funds are provided  for  in
the budget for infrastructure for taxi recapitalisation.
If the public transport subsidies are, in  fact,  necessary  for  buses  and
rail, then we would argue that taxis should be  proportionately  subsidised,
particularly if the realities of the new taxi roll-outs  take  place  within
this financial year.

Finally, it is of concern to me, and  I  am  sure  to  everyone  else,  that
during the debate on  this  Vote,  the  Minister  made  no  mention  of  the
implementation  of  the  following  Acts:  the   Road   Traffic   Management
Corporation Act, the Administrative Adjudication of  Road  Traffic  Offences
Act and the legislation regarding the Road Traffic Infringement Agency.  All
these Acts were passed by this House  and  relate  to  the  improvement  and
enforcement of aspects of road safety.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I regret that your time has expired, hon member.

Mr S B FARROW:  It  is  concerning,  therefore,  that  despite  funds  being
allocated for these purposes, nearly three years since  enactment  we  still
have been unable to progress on the delivery of these Acts. [Time expired.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, there are many motorists who use their  private
cars on a daily basis to go to work, even though it is  more  costly  to  do
so. One only needs to see the traffic jams here in the Western Cape  on  the
N1 and the N2 to substantiate this.

Many say that they do not have a choice as public transport is  both  unsafe
and unreliable. There is no form of criminal activity  that  does  not  take
place on our public transport, particularly on the trains, as  is  evidenced
in many situations.

The ACDP has, on a number of  occasions,  called  for  the  introduction  of
railway police to ensure the safety of our people who rely on this  mode  of
public transport.

Furthermore, the condition of our roads is  deteriorating  quickly,  as  has
been pointed out by previous speakers. The potholes on  our  national  roads
are increasing and I can personally vouch for the fact that the N12  between
Christiana and Wellington is particularly difficult to navigate.

The ACDP will not support this Budget Vote until  our  public  transport  is
safe, reliable and efficient.

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, very quickly - almost as  quickly  as  Premier
Mbazima  Shilowa's  Gautrain  will  get  from  Johannesburg  to  Pretoria  -
firstly, the ANC agrees with the previous speakers  that  there  is  serious
underfunding,  particularly  of  road  and  rail  infrastructure  and,  most
specifically, in terms of public transport. There is a  serious  problem  on
that front which we need to address.

As the ANC we accept that no national budget can do everything all  at  once
and that transport is not necessarily always going to be at the top  of  the
pecking order. We support Vote 32 as the ANC, but  with  the  expectation  -
this is addressed to Minister Manuel - that in future years  transport  will
start to receive a more dedicated focus. This is important. It is  not  just
a question of money, of course; it is a question  of  capacity  and  focused
strategies as well.

But that is it. We have arrived  in  Pretoria,  and  I  hope  that  Minister
Manuel can confirm that the transport message has also arrived in  Pretoria.
The ANC supports Vote 32. [Applause.]

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Speaker, I am going to take my full  12  minutes,  so  I
would ask the House to settle down. [Interjections.] I  have  one  amendment
that I want to propose and that is that the budget  of  the  Leader  of  the
Opposition be increased. The reason why I am proposing this is that  I  know
that I am probably the most brilliant speaker in the House, and  the  Leader
of the Opposition is so underresourced that he has  to  take  my  pearls  of
wisdom and put them into his speeches. I implore you, Madam Speaker, to  let
us raise his salary so that he can make his own speeches and not steal  from
mine. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

On  behalf  of  the  ANC  I  rise  in  support  of  this  Budget.  It  is  a
redistributive budget, yet it is growth-oriented. It  is  attentive  to  the
needs of the poor, yet mindful of the challenges ahead. It is  expansionary,
yet fiscally prudent. It is a Budget which  has  returned  over  R8  billion
back into the  hands  of  South  Africans  and  yet  significantly  expanded
Government spending.

On behalf of the ANC I would like to congratulate  the  Ministries  involved
and, in particular, the economic team and also the Minister of  Finance  and
his staff for bringing to this House this Budget.  I  wish  them  and  their
director-generals the best in implementing what  we  have  appropriated  for
them today. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker ...

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Are you crossing the floor ... [Interjections.]

Ms R TALJAARD: No, thank you, Minister Manuel; I am very happy where I am.

When Standard & Poor's upgraded South Africa's local  currency  rating  from
BB to A minus with a stable outlook, it listed the following  factors  which
constrained the country's  rating:  modest  external  liquidity;  structural
weaknesses including the poverty level and income inequality;  the  HIV  and
Aids crisis; and slow progress in other areas of structural reform  such  as
privatisation and the  relaxation  of  the  labour  market.  Many  of  these
factors remain either politically  sensitive  and  therefore  insufficiently
addressed  by  the  alliance,  or  are  simply  treated  with  blanket   and
controversial denial, such as the HIV/Aids crisis, until the  Constitutional
Court  intervened.  This  costs  our  country  dearly  in  forgone  investor
sentiment and confidence.

Addressing  these  matters  decisively  will  require  bold  leadership  and
decisive action, and the track record of the ANC in tackling these  matters,
marked new no-go areas by Cosatu, does not bode well for resolution.

While the endorsements by Standard &  Poor's  and  Moody's  of  Government's
macroeconomic approach will boost South  Africa's  prospects  of  attracting
FDI, at a time of growing wariness of emerging markets, FDI will be wary  of
hostile or negative signals. In the words of US  Secretary  of  State  Colin
Powell, ``Money is a coward.''

Signals such as those emanating from  the  dot-za  domain  debacle  and  the
travesty which is the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development  Bill  are
disastrous for our FDI prospects. While we are adopting tax  incentives,  as
we do in this Bill, to  attract  FDI,  other  policy  initiatives  must  not
flatly contradict or undermine these efforts. As the Economist  Intelligence
Unit commented, the FDI community are watching these signals closely:


  The tone of the Minerals Bill will be  a  significant  indicator  of  the
  Government's  approach  to  balancing  social  developmental  needs  with
  investor-friendly practices relevant  to  other  areas  of  policy  under
  debate, such as foreign ownership of land.

The current Bill before the Minerals and Energy committee not  only  affords
property rights insufficient protection, but also makes the  wrong  priority
assessment.

A vote in favour of this Appropriation Bill would be  tantamount  to  saying
that insufficient economic growth -  jobless  economic  growth,  at  that  -
political trade-offs that exacerbate disturbing inflationary  pressures  and
policy flip-flops that have jeopardised the Telkom IPO before and may do  so
again are good enough. Quite simply, more of the  same  in  this  regard  is
simply not good enough.

South Africa needs economic growth in excess  of  6%  to  dent  poverty  and
unemployment in a meaningful way. Real annual GDP growth for 2001  was  2,2%
compared with 3,4% in 2000. The low level of growth envisaged  in  the  2002
Budget is simply not good enough. As the Economist Intelligence  Unit  March
2002 country report points out,  communications  was  a  primary  source  of
growth within this element of growth that we saw. The continued  controversy
with the dot-za domain name and Telkom IPO  delays  do  not  bode  well  for
continued growth out of this sector.

While Government's efforts at reducing the deficit  have  been  commendable,
if not politically heroic, this has been  attributable  to  the  significant
revenue  overruns.  Clearly  in  the   context   of   failed   receipts   of
privatisation and paltry economic growth,  Sars  has  bailed  out  both  the
Treasury, in terms of  its  growth  targets,  and  the  Minister  of  Public
Enterprises on a number of occasions.

In this context of  clear  continued  hardship  and  poverty,  low  economic
growth, unemployment and rising inflation, the targeted tax  relief  we  are
voting on today in this Budget, and indeed next week in the Bill,  has  been
all but eroded by inflation and by the increasing ravages  of  increases  in
prices for food and services. Missing already low  economic  growth  targets
is unacceptable. More of the same is therefore not  acceptable  for  the  DA
and we cannot support this Bill.

When Minister Pahad knows something about economics one day,  then  we  will
talk. [Interjections.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, the IFP will support  the  Second  Reading  of
the Appropriation Bill. During the First Reading  we  paid  tribute  to  the
Minister, the Deputy Minister, the  director-general  and  staff  for  their
dedication and  hard  work.  Higher  tax  collection  by  Sars  enabled  the
Minister to reduce the tax rates and to physically put money back  into  the
pockets of the taxpayers.

A concern is that this window of  opportunity  will  become  proportionately
smaller in future as the effectiveness of Sars increases, because that  will
lead to more of the people who try  to  get  away  with  tax  evasion  being
caught out and the pool from which these extra moneys  are  being  collected
becoming smaller.

Inkatha has on several occasions proposed that  consideration  be  given  to
the introduction of a general basic income grant. We fully realise  that  it
will be very costly, but the alternative cost of  not  having  it  would  be
devastating to the poor and the indigent. The Taylor  commission  thoroughly
researched and considered the pros and cons of a  general  social  grant  or
basic income grant. More than 50% of the absolutely poor  would  move  to  a
higher category and become less dependent. The basic  income  grant  can  be
introduced in different stages. The gradual introduction  of  this  security
grant  would  assist  in   creating   the   necessary   infrastructure   and
administration.

Initially the grant can be made available in the form of a child  grant  and
an old age grant. This way one can then, at a later stage, make it  a  basic
income grant for all the people in South Africa.

Another concern to the IFP is the spiralling increases  in  interest  rates.
Economic growth is being jeopardised by  higher  interest  rates,  and  this
will impact on job  creation.  The  IFP  realises  that  inflation  must  be
curtailed, but we wish to remind  Government  of  the  economic  reality  of
inflation, defined as ``too much money chasing too  few  goods''.  Therefore
one can either do what  the  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  is  doing  by
curtailing the money or what the hon the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry
wants to do, and that is to improve the  manufacturing  of  goods  and  thus
increase the quantity of goods in relation to the money; then one  can  find
an equilibrium.

I am sure that the Minister of Finance will, in this regard, be  the  honest
broker and do for us  what  is  necessary  and  that  we  at  least  get  an
assurance that interest rates will not increase further.  I  think  we  have
reached the optimum level at which  we  can  scare  people  away  and  scare
industry away from further development. The  IFP  will  support  the  Second
Reading of the Appropriation Bill.

Dr P J  RABIE:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon
members, a number of internal and external factors  had  an  effect  on  the
Appropriation Bill. Our present economic outlook  is  positive  in  contrast
with the slowdown in international economic  growth.  Tax  relief  benefited
all income groups. The  rise  in  the  PPI  index  and,  recently,  of  CPIX
inflation to 9,2%, however, is of concern. The depreciation of the rand  had
an effect on fuel and food prices from about January. The  strengthening  of
the rand against the US dollar and the interest in gold, platinum and  other
commodity prices could lead  to  wide  economic  participation  and  further
business investment and job creation.

Die konsepwet moet ook gesien word dat  ekonomiese  groei  en  die  skep  en
instandhouding van infrastruktuur  nou  verband  hou  met  die  gehalte  van
besteding. Die finansiële rekenpligtigheid van staatsdepartemente  en  ander
openbare instansies, indien daar doelmatige besteding  van  geld  plaasvind,
is ook belangrik om in gedagte te hou. Indien daar wanbesteding  plaasgevind
het in sekere departemente, is dit rede tot kommer.

Die uitbouing van die  kapasiteit  van  die  openbare  sektor  om  diens  op
voetsoolvlak te lewer, is baie belangrik. Die vraag wat ontstaan,  is:  Word
daar werklik aan die behoeftes  van  'n  dinamiese  en  vinnig  veranderende
gemeenskap voldoen, waar armoede aan die orde van die dag  is?  Dit  is  nie
net die  Regering  se  plig  om  werklike  onregmatighede  ten  opsigte  van
besteding reg te stel, maar ook politieke ampsbekleërs behoort  hierdie  rol
te vul.
Ons moet probeer om 'n kultuur van doelgerigte  probleemoplossing  te  skep.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The draft Bill must also be seen in the light that economic growth and  the
creation and maintenance of infrastructure is in  close  relation  with  the
quality  of  expenditure.  It  is  also  important  to  keep  the  financial
accountability of government departments and other  government  institutions
in  mind   when   effective   expenditure   of   money   takes   place.   If
misappropriation of funds took place in certain departments, it gives  cause
for concern.

The expanding of the capacity of the public sector  to  deliver  service  at
grass-roots level is very important. The question that arises, is: Have  the
needs of a dynamic and rapidly changing  community,  where  poverty  is  the
order of the day, really been seen to? It is not the duty of the  Government
only to  rectify  true  irregularities  regarding  spending,  but  political
office-bearers should also fulfil this role.

We must try to create a culture of goal-oriented problem solving.]

The Portfolio Committee on Finance is busy finalising the Local  Government:
Municipal Finance Management Bill, which will  codify  municipal  accounting
practice and  provide  a  framework  for  the  284  newly  demarcated  local
authorities. The cost of the amalgamation of local  authorities  is  also  a
factor that must be taken into account.

The New NP supports this Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, hon members.  During  the  last  few  annual
budgets compliments have been bestowed  on  Team  Finance  in  the  National
Treasury. It was because of the fact that Team Finance,  under  the  capable
leadership of the Minister of Finance, the Deputy  Minister,  the  Director-
General of the National Treasury and the  top  echelon  of  the  department,
have created confidence in and laid a  solid  foundation  for  our  economy.
This has come about because of consistent hard  work  and  commitment,  good
strategy and good planning and a steadfast belief in their task.

My wish is that we will start to build Team South Africa  in  this  country,
where the confidence in our own country will become so strong that  it  will
rub off on investors. Corruption will be wiped out, from the prisons to  the
boardrooms of companies. The true spirit of  the  Constitution,  namely  co-
operative governance, will be lived in a practical  way  by  preserving  the
peace, national unity  and  the  indivisibility  of  the  Republic.  Service
delivery will become a reality in every corner of our country  and  each  of
us will try to make it work. Business, labour and Government will meet in  a
spirit of ``What can we do collectively to make Team South Africa a  shining
success?''. We will find new ways of unleashing the  entrepreneurial  spirit
in our society, so that South Africa can  produce  more  entrepreneurs  that
can win worldwide acclaim for their inventions.

Members of Team South Africa will ask: What can we do to  make  the  economy
work? How can we contribute to make Nepad a success story? What more can  we
do? How can we effectively create  jobs  for  our  people,  provide  quality
education for all  South  Africans  and  succeed  in  a  skills  development
initiative that will equip our people for the 21st century?

The time has come, eight years after our new democracy,  to  stand  together
as South Africans on major issues that will benefit our economy. We  owe  it
to future generations in our beloved country.

The UDM supports the Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, the debate on the Budget  should  be  the  most
important event in the nation's annual calendar. This is the  time  we  give
an account of the nation's  finances  and  whether  we  have  been  able  to
provide good governance in the management thereof.

The Budget should annually remind  us  of  the  moral,  ethical  and  social
equity which ought to be entrenched within public organs and  against  which
the performance of our institutions is judged. The role of  parliamentarians
in this regard cannot be overemphasised. Parliament remains the  bedrock  of
direction and delivery of excellence in stewardship and services.

The average taxpayer desires good governance, and this is why every year  we
engage in the Budget debate to measure our actions  against  the  wishes  of
our people. We have a moral obligation, therefore, not to misread,  misjudge
or misrepresent the basic wishes and needs of the electorate.

The ACDP commends Minister Manuel and his department because, on the  whole,
we sincerely believe that this Budget is  one  of  his  best.  We  therefore
support this Appropriation Bill.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, working on the Budget for 2002-03  has  been
really telling, since the exercise started  in  2001  with  preparation  and
presentation by the new Budget Committee and the department.  We  hope  that
the appropriation so enthusiastically approved will benefit  the  people  of
this country.

That there have been so few divisions on this Appropriation  Bill  is  proof
that we only  differ  to  agree.  We  hope  that  those  charged  with  this
appropriation will not let us down by underspending, which  has  become  the
propensity of some departments.

We thank the Minister for the trouble taken to put together  this  brilliant
budget. With this budget  at  their  disposal,  public  servants  only  have
themselves to blame if they do  not  perform.  The  UCDP  asks  of  them  to
remember that ... Maatlametlo a modisa go gogorosa. [One is judged by  one's
work.]

To the uninitiated, service delivery is the  name  of  the  game.  The  UCDP
supports the Appropriation Bill.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, South Africa is well on the road to a  one-
party state, as indicated by Mr Mugabe and  followed  by  Mr  Mbeki  and  Mr
Marthinus van Schalkwyk. [Interjections.] I have,  during  the  Budget  Vote
debate on Parliament, indicated to what extent the Rules of this  House  are
bent by the ANC. Madam Speaker, you have yourself indicated  that  you  will
want them amended to turn South Africa back  onto  the  road  of  democracy.
[Interjections.]

I have indicated what silent diplomacy our President has followed. He  tells
people not to make hate speeches, but he does nothing when they ignore him.

One wonders where South Africa would have been and how  far  we  would  have
gone on the road to democracy had Cyril Ramaphosa or Tokyo Sexwale  remained
in the presidential race. [Interjections.]

Die DA sal in die twee jaar wat voorlê alle Suid-Afrikaners oorreed  om  van
hierdie President en sy party ontslae te raak en daarom  stem  die  FA  teen
hierdie wetgewing. [During  the  two  years  that  lie  ahead  the  DA  will
convince all South Africans to get rid of this President and his  party  and
that is why the FA is voting against this legislation.]

Miss S  RAJBALLY:  Madam  Speaker,  concerning  the  Appropriation  for  the
financial year ending 31 March 2003, for the national sphere of  Government,
the MF expresses its approval. It is felt that the allocations made  to  the
top 10 budgets are  adequate.  However,  we  have  reservations,  and  these
concern the need to prioritise  a  larger  percentage  towards  Housing  and
Health. What is the sense in maintaining high levels of safety  and  defence
for an unhealthy and homeless nation?  Equilibrium  has  to  be  established
between internal and external necessities.

It is also felt that the boost  in  the  budget  for  Sport  and  Recreation
should be such that it can be used more adequately to recruit and to  divert
our youth from criminal tendencies.

It is heartening to note that our state  of  the  nation  address  has  been
upheld in the appropriation for Housing, Education and Health.
We thank the Minister for this  Appropriation  Bill.  The  MF  supports  it.
[Applause.]

THE MINISTER OF FINANCE: Somlomo [Chairperson], ... there are none so  blind
as those who will not see and none so deaf  as  those  who  will  not  hear.
Fortunately, the majority of parties in this House see, hear and  feel,  and
their communities and constituencies respond to a very positive Budget.

I would like to express  appreciation  to  those  who  have  supported  this
Budget this afternoon, and I ask that we go forward in the spirit of  unity.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:
1.     Second  Interim  Report  of  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Powers  and
     Privileges of Parliament, dated 20 June 2002:


         The Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Powers  and  Privileges  of  Parliament
         reports as follows:


         1. On 5 April 2001 the Committee was  instructed  to  consider  the
              recommendations  of  the  Joint  Subcommittee  on  Powers  and
              Privileges  of  Parliament,  and  to  introduce  a   Bill   in
              accordance with Chapter 13 of the National Assembly Rules.


         2.  The  Committee  considered  the  legislation,  research   work,
              written and oral submissions  from  the  public,  as  well  as
              inputs from provincial legislatures. It  also  conferred  with
              the Ad Hoc  Select  Committee  on  Powers  and  Privileges  of
              Parliament  of  the  National  Council   of   Provinces,   and
              incorporated amendments suggested by that committee.


         3. The Committee's scheduled  meetings  often  clashed  with  other
              meetings, which many members deemed as of primary  importance.
              This led to this  Committee's  meetings  being  cancelled,  or
              discussions going ahead with only a few members in attendance.


         4. The Committee last met on 28 May 2002. An Eighth Draft Bill  was
              prepared  for  discussion  by  political  parties  before  the
              Committee was to adopt the Bill and report to the House by  20
              June 2002. However, due to the passing away of  the  Committee
              Chairperson, Mr P R Mokaba, this time-frame could not be met.


         5. The Committee has recently been requested to consider  a  number
              of additional matters for inclusion  in  the  legislation.  It
              therefore requests  the  Chairperson  of  Committees  and  the
              Programming Committee, as well as the Chief Whips'  Forum,  to
              assist it by arranging suitable dates for it to meet,  bearing
              in mind that many members of this Committee  are  chairpersons
              of their own committees.


         6. This Committee needs to consider these matters in  depth,  amend
              the legislation where necessary,  adopt  the  final  Bill  and
              report to the National Assembly during the third term.


         7. With the above in mind, the  Committee  requests  the  House  to
              extend its  deadline  to  a  date  to  be  determined  by  the
              Programming Committee for reporting to it and for  introducing
              the final Bill.


         Report to be considered.

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government
     on Property Valuation in Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Western Cape  and
     other relevant Provinces, dated 20 June 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government  reports
         as follows:


         (a)     Current valuations of property in  the  Eastern  Cape,  the
              Northern Cape and the Western Cape, for  purposes  of  rating,
              have been  undertaken  in  terms  of  the  Property  Valuation
              Ordinance, 1993 (Cape) ("the Ordinance").


         (b)      Potential   legal   challenges   exist   regarding   these
              valuations.


         (c)      The  said  challenges  may  arise   in   regard   to   the
              applicability or otherwise of the Ordinance.


         (d)     Legal certainty is  required  regarding  the  applicability
              and interpretation of the Ordinance.


         (e)     There  may  be  other  provinces  which  may  be  similarly
              affected.


         (f)     Time-consuming steps are required  for  the  processing  of
              local government legislation.


         (g)     The  imminent  processing  of  the  Local  Government  Laws
              Amendment Bill provides a window of opportunity to address the
              abovementioned concerns regarding the Ordinance.


         The Committee therefore recommends that -


         (1)      appropriate  legislative  measures  are  attended  to  and
              processed in the "Local Government Laws Amendment Bill",  when
              that  Bill  is  introduced  in  Parliament,  with  a  view  to
              resolving any uncertainties regarding  the  applicability  and
              interpretation  of  the  Property  Valuation  Ordinance,  1993
              (Cape), and of  any  other  provincial  ordinances  which  may
              suffer from similar uncertainties; and


         (2)     the abovementioned  legislative  measures  be  attended  to
              expeditiously.


     Report to be considered.
