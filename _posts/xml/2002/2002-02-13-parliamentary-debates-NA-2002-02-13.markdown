                 RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

Mr N P NHLEKO: Madam Speaker, hon members, Comrade  President,  yesterday  I
was moved when, in his address to Parliament, reflecting on the question  as
to why the IFP was in President Mbeki's Cabinet, the president of  the  IFP,
Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, answered his posed question as follows:


  Only those who have witnessed the horrors of war may fully appreciate how
  true reconciliation, which goes deep in  the  hearts  and  minds  of  our
  people, is more important than any political  or  policy  differentiation
  which one may wish to highlight to promote a well-functioning democracy.

It is in this context that I am reminded of a personal  experience.  Sifiso,
my younger brother, got killed in this war in 1992. Naturally,  at  home  we
reacted bitterly and angrily to this. This was one thing  that  we  felt  we
could not take lying down. My father, who is the same age as  the  president
of the IFP, cautioned against the anger that was engulfing us. He said:


  My boy, sometimes the point is lost in this war between the IFP  and  the
  ANC, and that is that no political party gives  birth  to  human  life  -
  rather, it is people who form political parties and  not  the  other  way
  round.

He went on to say that the tragedy that befell us demanded that we turn  our
anger around into an effort to end this war and reconcile our  people.  This
reinforces a call to all of us, as espoused in the  ANC's  constitution,  to
unite our people in the fight  against  poverty  and  disease,  and  in  the
eradication of the scourge of racism and all other forms of intolerance.  It
is these kinds of  perspectives  and  experiences  that  made  South  Africa
unique and made it succeed in  its  struggle  for  freedom.  The  truth  is,
anywhere else in the world this would have been a recipe for disaster.

Our President, in his address to Parliament  on  8  February  2002,  took  a
great stride in the process of uniting our people for  a  common  purpose  -
freedom. We congratulate the President for  his  excellent  leadership.  The
current political situation is owing to various milestones  in  the  history
of this country. It is owing  to  the  indigenous  people,  the  arrival  of
European settlers,  the  subsequent  wars  for  liberation,  the  birth  and
banning of liberation movements, and, lastly, the victory of the  democratic
forces that led to our current democratic dispensation.

Firstly, it is important to realise that we are Africans. One  cannot  be  a
European and an African at the same time. Sometimes one wonders if  this  is
the common understanding of every one of us here, gauging by the  fact  that
some of us are quick to disown the country's setbacks.
Since 1994, while listening to speeches made by other political  parties  in
this House, one has wondered whether we are all South Africans  and  whether
we are all talking about one and the same country.

One schoolmate used to tell the following joke. A Mr  Jacobson  had  a  game
farm. He and other farmers were experiencing severe drought. At  this  stage
of the drought, Jacobson was left  with  only  one  elephant  on  the  farm.
Farmworkers had been retrenched, with the exception of  Joe.  Both  Jacobson
and Joe, for very different reasons, of course, were very fond of  this  one
and only elephant. The drought became worse, and the situation  became  more
and more hopeless. I am told that an elephant can go on for about  ten  days
without a drop of water. On the 15th day this elephant died. By  this  time,
the ground was hard-baked, cracked into  rectangular  blocks.  Jacobson  was
crying, in mourning. On the other hand, Joe was doing the  same  thing.  The
extent and rate of mourning was the same. On  the  face  of  it,  witnessing
this incident, one could easily  have  concluded  that  both  men  had  lost
something dear and of equal value.  However,  upon  close  examination,  the
reasons were not the same at all. For Jacobson, it was obvious that  he  had
lost his one and only reason for having a farm - the elephant. For Joe,  the
issue was not only that he was going to lose  his  job,  but  the  difficult
question was - who was  going  to  dig  the  grave  to  bury  the  elephant?
[Laughter.]

This story attempts to emphasize the need for all South Africans to  act  in
unity in dealing with the problems that the  country  is  faced  with.  This
would assist us in bridging the gap on the race and class question. That  is
how we should  understand  the  call  by  the  President.  The  struggle  to
eradicate racism is a struggle for humanity. It is the struggle to  discover
oneself able to build a humane society. It is  our  duty  to  create  common
values and norms in order to create a true sense  of  nationhood,  and  thus
decrease the incidence of social prejudice among our people.

The ANC has given us a platform through which to achieve  this  objective  -
Letsima. It is in the spirit of this approach, a call for unity, as  led  by
the President, that the current political realignments, the  ANC-IFP-New  NP
arrangement, should be understood. This development  cannot  be  interpreted
narrowly to mean simply institutional arrangements, for example,  governance
structures and power. It  is  a  national  effort  to  overcome  the  common
problems of poverty and underdevelopment.  It  is  an  effort  that  has  to
succeed. It is a call to awaken in us the  spirit  of  collectivism,  social
duty and love for one another.

In this regard, we acknowledge the immense contributions made by  our  white
compatriots who have identified  with  this  cause  for  humanity.  We  also
welcome and acknowledge those whites who have come to realise that  fighting
against racism and  identifying  with  the  poor  makes  them  better  human
beings. They have done this in the face  of  stigmatisation,  prejudice  and
ostracisation. Through the leadership provided by  the  President  the  term
``Afrikaner'' has for the first time  been  given  its  proper  meaning  and
context.

Colonialism and apartheid played a major role  in  the  destruction  of  our
moral  values.  By  their  very  nature,  colonialism  and   apartheid   are
destructive and inhuman processes.  Their  legacy  is  still  with  us.  The
stance taken by the President in calling for moral  regeneration,  the  call
for Letsima, must be understood to mean  that  all  patriots  must  pick  up
their spears and shields and  join  us.  The  fight  against  racism,  child
abuse, women abuse and rape is at the  centre  of  the  movement  for  moral
regeneration.  We  cannot  accept  being  afflicted  by   the   scourge   of
colonialism and apartheid and allow a  society  that  becomes  an  enemy  to
itself. The war on this front must be fought with a lot of ingenuity.

Many people have alluded to a well-managed  South  African  economy.  Others
have welcomed the fact that our economy is growing while at  the  same  time
shedding jobs - thus making it an economy characterised by jobless growth.

Before the arrival of European  colonisers,  our  people  lived  largely  on
subsistence farming. Seeking to exploit the mineral wealth of  our  country,
the colonisers turned our people  into  labourers  through  coercive  means,
among others, poll tax and wars. Thus  for  a  long  time  our  economy  was
labour intensive with no intention on the side of the successive  oppressive
regimes to develop our people and provide them with skills.

With the changing economic world and the need to be competitive in order  to
grow, our economy is rapidly changing from being a labour-intensive  economy
to being a skills-based  economy.  This  poses  a  great  challenge  to  us,
particularly because a great majority  of  our  people  are  uneducated  and
unskilled, and therefore find themselves in an economic environment that  is
becoming more and more averse to them.

The Minister of Labour in his speech yesterday dealt with how Government  is
seized  with  this  issue.  Our  task  is  to  reinforce  these  efforts  by
Government, by making a call to our people in the spirit  of  Letsima,  that
learning a skill of whatever nature is a matter of life and death.  The  day
our people are skilled is the day we would have  taken  a  great  leap  away
from poverty. We welcome a number of other initiatives by some  segments  of
the business sector in this regard. They are proudly South African.

In conclusion, a tiger knows what it takes to be a tiger. A bird knows  what
to be. There is only one kind of living species that does not know  what  it
takes to be, namely humankind. It will always be in search of itself.  Along
the way, we have  stumbled  and  sometimes  stuttered,  but  we  have  never
stopped in our endeavour to transform our nation.

The  President  has  provided  leadership.  Our  struggle  against  poverty,
disease, racism and xenophobia is about honour and dignity. [Applause.]

UNGQONGQOSHE WEZOLIMO NEZEMIHLABA:  Somlomo,  Mongameli,  Sekela  Mongameli,
malunga   ahloniphekile   esishayamthetho,   ngiyethemba   ukuthi    sisonke
singamalunga  alendlu  ehloniphekile  sizokwazi  ukunika  impendulo   eqotho
embuzweni obuzwe  uMongameli  enkulumeni  yakhe  ngoLwesihlanu  othi,  ngabe
konke esikwenzayo  singamalunga  alendlu  njengoNgqongqoshe,  amajaji  kanye
nezisebenzi zikahulumeni kuyasiza yini ukuqeda inhlupheko nokungathuthuki?

Ngizothi qaphu qaphu  kancane  kuleli  thuba  engilinikiwe  ngichaze  ukuthi
thina  njengoKhongolose  okuyithi  futhi   esiphethe   umbuso   ngabe   yini
esiyenzile ukuzama ukulwa nendlala kanye nobuphofu kuleli zwe,  ikakhulukazi
emakhaya    nasezindaweni    ezingamadolobha.    Siziqhenya    ngemiphumela,
singakhohlwanga ukuthi umkhankaso usemkhulu walokho  okufanele  sikulungise,
ngesintu bathi, ``akuvelwa kanye kanye kungemadlebe embongolo''.

Kanjalo nathi emizameni yokuqeda ukuhlupheka angeke  sibe  namandla  okwenza
imilingo yokuthinta imiphefumulo yonke ngamunye ngamunye  esabhekene  nalesi
simo. Kodwa  kancane  kancane  siyoze  siphumelele.  Enkulumeni  kaMongameli
kweledlule uphinde wagcizelela ukubaluleka kohlelo  lokuthuthukisa  izindawo
zasemakhaya kanye nalezo ezisemadolobheni. Ubekusho lokhu  ngoba  azi  kahle
kamhlophe  ukuthi  lezi  zindawo  zisabonisa  umfanekiso  obuhlungu  wezinto
ezoniwa ngaphambili. Kodwa-ke singekhale manje, okwethu ukuba silungise.

Onyakeni odlule waqoka izindawo eziyi-13 zasemakhaya  neziyisishiyagalombili
zasemadolobheni okufanele kuqale kuzo uhlelo lwentuthuko.

Wagcizelela ukuthi lo msebenzi kufanele wenziwe  ngokubambisana  kuyo  yonke
imikhakha kaHulumeni -  komasipala,  ezifundazweni,  ezindlini  zikahulumeni
kundlunkulu   kanye   namaparastatal.   Wabuye    wagcizelela    ukubaluleka
kokusebenza ngokungaqhudelani  ukuze  sonke  sinikeze  ngokusemandleni  ethu
entuthukweni yalabo abasantulayo.

Singamalunga kaKhongolose kanye namalunga ale Ndlu yePhalamende  sakwamukela
lokhu ngezandla  ezifudumele.  Mhlawumbe  okunye  okwasenza  saba  nentokozo
ukwazi ukuthi ngisho ngesikhathi izwe lethu lihluthwa  ngendluzula,  sisuswa
kulezo   zindawo   okwakungezethu   ngendabuko,   asizange   silwele   ukuya
emadolobheni.  Umshikashika  wethu  kwakungukuzithuthukisa  kulezo   zindawo
esikuzo.

SiwuKhongolose sajabula-ke futhi ngoba iningi lalaba  bantu  abangabalandeli
bethu  bahlala  emakhaya.  Nalabo  abahamba  baya  emadolobheni  kwakungenxa
yokuntula befuna imisebenzi. Ngingasho nje futhi malunga ahloniphekile,  uma
sikhumbuzana, ngithi uMongameli uhambe ngqo ngalowo mqulu esasiwubhalile  i-
Reconstruction  and  Development  lapho  nakhona  sabalula  ngokuthuthukiswa
kwamadolobha kanye nezindawo zasemakhaya.

UZizi kanye noHulumeni wakhe  abazilahlanga  izimfuno  zabantu  ezazichaziwe
kulo  mqulu  njengoba  abanye  becabanga.   Ingabe   yimiphi-ke   imiphumela
esesiyibonile? Ocwaningweni esilwenzile kule  nyanga  ephezulu  kuyabonakala
ukuthi izinhlelo zokuthuthukisa  seziqalile.  Amaprojekthi  abalelwa  ku-137
emakhaya kanye nangu-108 asemadolobheni abonisa isithombe  nokho  esingcono.
Ngingabala nje  eKgalagadi  lapho  khona  abahlali  bathe  besakha  imigwaqo
baphinde  babona  imboni  ebaluleke  kakhulu,   imboni   yezimbuzi.   Abanye
bangahleka bathi izimbuzi zingaba imboni kanjani.
Phela izimbuzi lezi yizona  ezingasiza  ukwakha  iminotho  zithathe  nolwazi
lwabantu  basemakhaya  ngokwazi  kwabo,  zenze   futhi   izimboni   zokwakha
izicathulo nezigqoko nezikhwama. Ngingabala ngithini? U-Eskom ulethe  ugesi,
namalungu ale Ndlu  afana  nobaba  u-Kasril,  abonile  ukuthi  amanzi  ngabe
ayasondela yini eduzane. Ngalezo zindlela siyabonisa  ukuthi  uma  sisebenza
ngokubambisana kuningi esingakuzuza.

EFreyistata laphaya kumasipala waseMaloti -a- Phofung  esifundeni  saseThabo
Mofutsanyana   siwakhile   umtapo   wezincwadi   sisebenzisana   ne-Carnegie
Foundation.  Lokhu  besikwenza  ngoba  sazi  ukuthi  imfundo   nokuqeqesheka
kubalulekile nakubantu basemakhaya.

Endaweni  yase-Alexander  khona  umsebenzi   wokwakha   kabusha   usuqalile.
Ngikhuluma  nje  indawo  yase-Jukskei,   ukunakekelwa   kwemvelo   nokuvimba
ukuguguleka  komhlabathi   sekuphelile.   Sesiyasibona   isithombe   sempilo
engcono. Izindlu ezibalelwa ku-7000 zizokwakhiwa kulo nyaka ophezulu.

EMdantsane endaweni ebizwa ngokuthi ise-Highway laphaya ematekisini  nakhona
sisiqedile   isikhumulo   samatekisi   namabhasi,   kwabonakala    impucuko.
Siyaqhubeka-ke nale misebenzi. EKhayelitsha  isakhiwo  senkantolo  yemantshi
siyabonakala. Ngingabala ngithini, ngoba miningi le misebenzi eseyenzekile.

Ukuzimisela kwethu ukwakha kabusha  leli  zwe  kwakufanele.  Isibopho  sethu
kwakungukwakha  imiphakathi  ephilayo,   ezimele,   engasweli   neziqhenyayo
ngobuzwe bayo. Siyazi ukuthi imiphakathi yasemakhaya imiphakathi  engaphansi
kwezindawo  zamakhosi.  NjengoKhongolose-ke  futhi   siyakwazi   ukubaluleka
kokuthi silucacise udaba lokuthi amakhosi azoba naqhaza lini kwezombusazwe.

Ngithanda ukukubeka ngokusobala ukuthi ngokwami  ukubona,  nozakwethu  futhi
bangavuma, umsebenzi wokuphothula lolu daba  nokho  usuhambe  ibanga  elithe
xaxa. Ngikhuluma nje  onyakeni  odlule  laphaya  kwaZulu-Natali  sasidingida
udaba olubalulekile lokuphathwa kwemihlaba.  Sasikwenza  lokhu  sazi  ukuthi
zikhona izingqinamba.

Uma singabheka nje, ezinye  zalezo  zingqinamba  ngeziphathelene  nokubangwa
kwemingcele, ukwabiwa kwemihlaba nendlela okufanele  leyo  mihlaba  iphathwe
ngayo;   ukuthi   kufanele   ibe   namatayitela    yini    kumbe    iphathwe
ngokuhlanganyela ngokwezigodi. Lezi ngezinye zezinto  okufanele  sizidingide
ukuze sibone ukuthi ngabe qhaza lini esingalibamba kulokhu.

Akusikho-ke lokho kuphela. Ngawo futhi uNovemba wonyaka owedlule  sihlangane
namakhosi endabuko, sabheka ukuthi ngabe eminye  iminyango  kaHulumeni  yona
ingabona kuyikuphi okufanele kwenziwe  ngamakhosi  endabuko.  Ngokusobala-ke
kuyakhombisa  ukuthi  asisibi  kangako  isithombe  sokulungisa  lolu   daba.
Sizoyibona impumelelo kungekudala.

Le mifanekiso engiyibalile yentuthuko iyizinkomba zokuthi uHulumeni  uyazama
esebenzisana nemiphakathi nezinhlangano zayo.  Kodwa  isifundo  esisifundile
kulo mshikashika ukuthi ukuze  sisebenze  ngesivinini,  kubalulekile  ukuthi
sithuthukise ikakhulukazi  izinga  lezisebenzi  ezikumasipala,  kanti  futhi
nendlela  izisebenzi   zikahulumeni   ezisebenza   ngayo   kuzofanele   ithi
ukuguquka. Akufuneki umuntu athi, mina ngiqashwe umNyango  wezaManzi  ngakho
ngeke ngiyosebenza laphaya kuleya ndawo. Ngezinye  zezinto  lezi  eziyosenza
sazi ukuthi uma sisebenza ngokubambisana singaphumelela.

Eminye yemibandela esiyibone ibalulekile ukwazi ukuthi  ukumiswa  kwezakhiwo
ezifana  nezingqalasizinda  kubaluleke  kangakanani  ekutheni   kube   khona
impumelelo  esimeme.  Omunye  umzekelo   esihamba   phezu   kwawo   owokuthi
ngaphandle  kokuthi   sibe   nezimiso   zokuthuthukisa   nokwakha   umnotho,
esikwenzayo kuyofana nokwakha ize  leze,  kanti  uma  ngabe  sizibheka  lezi
zinto   siyobona   ukuqhakaza.   SiwuKhongolose    masincome    oNgqongqoshe
bakaMongameli   ikakhulukazi   kohulumeni    basekhaya    ngokuthi    baqale
umshikashika wokuthi  omasipala  bakhe  izinhlelo  behlanganisa  imiphakathi
ukubheka ukuthi intuthuko yabo ingahlelwa kanjani, lokhu esikubiza  ngokuthi
i-Integrated Development Plan (IDP).

Lokhu-ke kuzodinga ukuthi sibe nokubekezela ngoba ngesinye isikhathi  ukuthi
sithintane  nemiphakathi  akuzukwenza  ukuthi   senze   izinto   ngokushesha
njengokuthanda kwethu.  Enkulumeni  yakhe  uphinde  wasikhumbuza  uMongameli
ukuthi masingabi ngamavila, silinde ukwenzelwa ngaso sonke  isikhathi  kodwa
uthe masivuke sizenzele.

Ngikhumbula  lapha  omunye  owayeyilunga  lale  Ndlu   uMaKhuzwayo.   Amanye
amalungu ahloniphekile ayamazi  ukuthi  wayesenhlanganweni  ye-YWCA  ngaleso
sikhathi.  Babezibiza-ke  ngokuthi  bayiNhlangano  kaZenzele.   Engakuthanda
isiqubulo sabo esasithi, ``We lift as we  climb"  [Senyuka  sifukula].  Lesi
siqubulo  siyisikhumbuzo  sokuthi  uma  sidonsa  masidonse  kanyekanye,  uma
kukhona owayo masimfukule ngoba phela yilelo nalelo galelo  elenziwa  yilowo
nalowo libalulekile ekwakheni isizwe esisha.

Enkulumeni kaMongameli yangoLwesihlanu uphinde wabalula udaba  olubalulekile
kanti  nayizolo  amalungu   aleNdlu   aluthintile,   ukubaluleka   nenselelo
esisabhekene nayo ngokuntulwa  kwemisebenzi,  nesifo  sengculazi.  Ngingasho
ngingangabazi   ukuthi   thina   njengenhlangano    kaKhongolose    sizwile.
Sizokhumbula futhi ukuthi ezinye zalezi zinto engizibalile  enkulumeni  yami
ziyizinkomba  zokuzama  ukuqeda  ububha  nendlala  kanye  nokwakha  amathuba
emisebenzi.

Mhlawumbe kubalulekile futhi kule Ndlu sike sikhumbuzane  ukuthi  kwakunguye
uMongameli  lo  ngonyaka   ka-1997   owakha   umbimbi   lobumbano   phakathi
kukaHulumeni,  izinhlangano  zawo   kanye   nemiphakathi   ekulweni   nesifo
sengculazi.  Okwakubalulekile  ukuthi   wathi   sonke   masibambane.   Isifo
sengculazi lesi  akusiwo  umsebenzi  wezempilo  kuphela,  kodwa  ngumsebenzi
obhekene nathi  sonke.  Kodwa  okubalulekile  futhi  akuphindile  enkulumeni
yakhe ngoLwesihlanu ukubaluleka  kokuqeda  ubuphofu  kanye  nendlala.  Sonke
singofakazi bokuthi umzimba ongondlekile kahle utholwa nanoma yiziphi  izifo
kanti umzimba owondlekile amasosha awo ayasiza ukuthi uvikeleke.
Ngakho, usikhumbuzile ukuthi  uma  sibheka  lesi  simo  masingathathi  lokho
okuzwana nathi, kodwa masibheke konke esikwenzayo  ukuthi  ngabe  kuyosisiza
na ukubhekana nalo mshikashika, kusisize yini ekwakheni ikusasa elihle.

Mhlawumbe   bakhona   abangasiboni   isidingo   sokuthi    lo    mshikashika
kaVukuzenzele  ubaluleke  ngani,  kwazise  phela   ukuthi   bona   bebehleli
emanonini, bedla  bekhomba  ngophakathi  lapho  abanye  bethu  bedla  imbuya
ngothi.  Thina-ke  esikwaziyo  ukuhlupheka,  sithi  siyithathile   inselele.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[The MINISTER FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  Deputy
President, hon members, I hope that we as members of this House  can  answer
the President's question that he asked on Friday. He asked then if  what  we
are doing here as hon members  of  this  House,  as  Ministers,  judges  and
public servants, help to alleviate poverty and underdevelopment.

I will briefly mention in this short period of time what we as  the  ANC-led
Government have done to alleviate poverty in  this  country,  especially  in
the rural and urban areas. We are proud of the results and we also  remember
that there is big campaign about what needs to be rectified. In the  African
culture they say: "We do not show up at the same time, like the  ears  of  a
donkey". The same applies to our efforts to alleviate  poverty.  We  do  not
have the power to perform miracles and touch the soul of everyone  else  who
is facing this situation. However, little by little we will succeed. In  his
speech last week, the President emphasised the importance of the  rural  and
urban development programme. He said this because he  knew  very  well  that
these places are still showing a painful picture of things that were  messed
up in the past. But we cannot cry now, it is up to us to correct them.

Last year he  identified  13  rural  areas  and  8  urban  areas  where  the
development plan should begin. He emphasised that  all  Government  sectors,
municipalities, provincial government, national Government  and  parastatals
should do this job jointly. He also emphasised  the  importance  of  working
without competing so that we will provide to the poor as much as we can.

As members of the ANC and members of this House, we accepted that with  warm
hands. Perhaps what pleased us was the knowledge that even when our  country
was taken from us by force, when we were removed from our traditional  land,
we did not fight for going to cities. Our struggle was to improve  ourselves
in the places where we were living.

As the ANC we are happy, because the majority of our supporters are  in  the
rural areas. Those who went to urban areas did so for job-hunting  purposes.
As a reminder, hon members, I can say that the President has followed up  on
what we wrote in the Reconstruction and Development  charter,  in  which  we
mentioned the development of rural and urban areas.

Zizi and his Government did not ignore the wants of the people as  they  are
explained in the charter, as some people may think.  What  results  have  we
seen? According to the research conducted  last  month,  it  is  clear  that
development programmes have already started. There are  about  137  projects
in the rural areas and  108  in  the  urban  areas,  which  shows  a  better
picture. I can mention Kgalagadi, where residents,  while  they  were  still
building the roads, saw the opportunity for an important  industry,  a  goat
firm. Some may laugh and say how can goats be a firm.

Goats are the ones that can help to build wealth and utilise  the  knowledge
of the rural people and build shoe, hat and  bag  industries.  The  list  is
endless. Eskom has brought electricity and hon members in this  House,  ones
like father Kasrils, has ensured that water is brought close to  people.  In
that way we show that a lot can be gained if we work co-operatively.

At the Maloti-a-Phofung municipality in the Thabo Mofutsanyana  district  in
the Free  State,  we  have  built  a  library  together  with  the  Carnegie
Foundation. We did this because we knew  that  education  and  training  are
important even to the rural people.

In Alexandra the reconstruction programme has started. Today in the  Jukskei
area the natural conservation work  has  been  completed.  We  now  see  the
picture of a better life. About 7 000 houses will be built this year.

In Mdantsane, at a place called Highway, we have  completed  a  bus  station
and a taxi rank. Now there is civilisation. We  are  continuing  with  these
jobs. In Khayelitsha, the court building  is  appearing  now.  The  list  is
endless, because a lot of work has been done.
Our determination to rebuild this country is the right thing. Our aim is  to
build good, and serious communities,  ones  that  have  everything  and  are
proud of their nationality. We know that the  rural  society  is  a  society
that is run by amakhosi. As the ANC  we  are  aware  of  the  importance  of
clarifying the role of amakhosi in politics.

I would like to mention that as far as my colleagues and  I  are  concerned,
the work of concluding this issue has gone the  extra  mile.  Last  year  in
KwaZulu-Natal we talked about the important issue, that  of  managing  land.
We did this although we were aware that there were problems.

We must look at other issues, like border disputes and  land  redistribution
and the way that land should be managed, determining  whether  there  should
be land titles or whether land should be managed  jointly  by  clans.  These
are some of the things that we should discuss so that we can see  what  role
we can play here.

It is not only that, in November last year we met with traditional  leaders.
We looked at what other government departments think amakhosi should do.  It
is clear that what it will take to correct this situation is not  that  bad.
We will witness success soon.

These pictures of progress that I have mentioned are  indicators  that  show
that  the  Government  is  trying  to  work  with  communities   and   their
organisations. But the lesson we learned in this struggle is that  in  order
to deliver speedily, it is important to improve the  level  of  municipality
workers, and that the way government employees work needs to be  changed.  A
person should not say I  work  for  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry, therefore I cannot work elsewhere. This is one of the things  that
make us aware that if we work co-operatively we will succeed.

Another aspect  that  we  saw  as  an  important  thing,  was  to  know  the
importance  of  establishing  infrastructures  to  ensure  greater  success.
Another line that we follow is that without improvement  of  conditions  and
wealth creation, what we are creating will be  worthless,  but  if  we  look
into these things, we will see success. As  the  ANC  we  should  thank  the
Ministers, especially the local governments, for  starting  the  process  of
building structures to unite communities  so  that  we  can  see  how  their
development  can  be  arranged,  something  that  we  call  the   Integrated
Development Plan, IDP.

This will need patience, because sometimes  communicating  with  communities
will not enable us to speed up things the way we want  to.  In  his  speech,
the President reminded us not to be lazy, and that we should  not  wait  for
anyone else to do things for us, we should do things ourselves.

I remember Ms Khuzwayo, who was a member of this  House.  Some  of  us  know
that she was in the YWCA at that time. They called themselves  the  ``Do  it
yourself Organisation''. What I liked was their motto that  said:  "We  lift
as we climb". This motto reminds us that if we pull, we must pull  together.
If someone falls, we must lift him up, because each and  every  weight  each
individual adds is important in building a new country.

In his Friday speech, the President mentioned a very  important  issue,  and
yesterday members of this house mentioned the  important  challenge  we  are
facing in respect of job creation and Aids. I can proudly  say  that  we  as
the ANC got the message.  We  will  remember  that  some  of  the  things  I
mentioned in my speech are the indicators that show  how  we  can  alleviate
poverty and create employment.

Maybe it is important for us in this House  to  remember  that  it  was  the
President  in  1997  who  formed  an  alliance  among  the  Government,  its
organisations and communities in a fight against Aids. Aids is  not  only  a
challenge for the Department of Health, but all of us. The  other  important
thing  that  the  President  mentioned  in  his  speech  on  Friday  is  the
importance of fighting poverty and starvation.

We are all the witnesses of the fact  that  a  malnourished  body  can  more
easily be affected by diseases  than  a  well  nourished  one,  because  the
immune system of the latter protects it. Therefore, the  President  reminded
us that we should look at this situation, and take not only  what  is  right
for us. In fact, he said we should look at what we are doing and see  if  it
will help in facing the struggle and in building a better future.

Perhaps there are those who do not see a need for the ``Wake up  and  do  it
yourself'' struggle and its importance. They do not  see  it,  because  they
are living well, while others are  living  in  poverty.  We  as  people  who
experienced hardship say we have accepted the challenge. [Applause.]]

Miss S  RAJBALLY:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,  hon  Deputy  President,
Ministers and  hon  members,  firstly,  the  MF  would  like  to  take  this
opportunity to welcome all members to the new year.  Hopefully  all  members
are fresh and determined to undertake the  year's  challenges  in  a  united
effort.

The MF welcomes the President's state of  the  nation  address,  as  it  was
acclaimed nationwide and by all  parties,  with  the  exception  of  a  few,
especially  the  DP,  who  constantly  criticise  our  present  Government's
achievements.  The  MF  applauds  our  achievement  of  advancing   in   the
eradication of poverty and underdevelopment in our country. We  are  pleased
to note that the pursuit to attain  the  further  breakdown  of  these  will
continue on an even larger  scale,  as  evidenced  by  the  two  forthcoming
summits, namely  the  summit  for  African  union  and  the  other  one  for
sustainable development, to be held later this year. This  will  make  South
Africa an important stakeholder in the reawakening of Africa.

The unsolicited report by  the  team  of  academics  at  the  University  of
Stellenbosch with regard to the  Government's  performance  during  2001  is
certainly impressive. Whilst  the  MF  congratulates  all  stakeholders  who
worked hard at attaining this, we would like  to  encourage  by  using  such
good performance as an incentive to  inspire  ability  and  to  attain  even
greater performance achievement in the year ahead.

It is most satisfying to acknowledge the advancement in aspects that  affect
our citizenry's  daily  lives,  namely  the  extensive  advancement  in  the
delivery of clean and running water,  electricity,  grid  connections,  land
redistribution, housing and education. The MF holds firm  to  the  President
quote that ``governance is not about pushing buttons  and  things  happening
instantaneously''.

We have come a long way and the results  we  have  attained  thus  far  most
certainly represents progress from the backlog inherited from the  apartheid
regime. What is more important to note is that we have not done this  alone.
It has been a united effort and represents long hours of work by our  entire
nation, those who have undertaken to work to achieve  its  new  Government's
policies with no reservation as to its diversity. I guess that makes us  the
rainbow nation that we are known to be.

The MF hereby supports  the  people's  campaign,  Vuk'uzenzele,  meaning  to
arise and act, which is certainly a logical means to  attain  our  aims.  We
announce  our  support  for  the  further   eradication   of   poverty   and
underdevelopment,  as  Government's  undertaking  for  the  year  ahead.  We
further support all efforts in the Government's plans for 2002 to  ``further
develop our greatest resource, our people;  initiate  additional  programmes
to improve the quality of life; social equity aimed at achieving high  rates
of economic growth and development; to improve the efficiency of  Government
to further strengthen and entrench  our  system  of  democratic  governance;
discharge its current international responsibility; and  actively  encourage
participation  and  promote  the  involvement  in  the  peoples'   campaign,
Vuk'uzenzele.''

Once again, the  MF  supports  the  people's  campaign  Vuk'uzenzele,  which
means, arise and  act,  and  calls  for  united  effort  to  carry  out  the
sentiment which this campaign aims at achieving.

The year 2001 has come and gone and 2002  has  dawned  upon  us,  with  many
challenges that we seek to meet and many endeavours that we seek to fulfil.

Siyaya,  sizohamba  naye  uMongameli   futhi   siyoze   sifike   ekugcineni.
Sizobanceda abantu bakithi  eNingizimu  Afrika.  [Ihlombe.]  [We  are  going
there, and we will go with the President until we reach  the  end.  We  will
help our people in South Africa. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, Comrades  President  and
Deputy President and hon members of the House, the international  effort  to
help in the reconstruction of Afghanistan was one of the  matters  that  the
President raised on  Friday.  Internationalism  has  been  one  of  the  key
principles around which the ANC shaped the struggle for  the  liberation  of
South Africa.

In its final  clause,  the  Freedom  Charter  spells  out  the  role  of  an
independent South Africa vis-à-vis world peace,  in  the  following  manner,
and I quote:


  South Africa shall strive to maintain world peace and the  settlement  of
  all international disputes by negotiation, not war.

This is an ideal which enjoys the support of our nation, united as it is  on
the question of peace among our  people  and  peace  within  and  among  the
nations of the world. If there are any opponents  of  this  principle,  they
will be reckless and misguided mavericks who, fortunately for  us,  will  be
no more than a handful.

The question of war and peace was among a number of  issues  raised  in  the
state of the nation address. The manner in which Comrade  President  arrived
at these matters was well  informed.  The  ANC  says  in  its  strategy  and
tactics document, and I quote:


  The liberation of South Africa was both a local expression of a  changing
  world and part of the catalyst to  renewed  efforts  aimed  at  attaining
  international consensus on the most urgent questions facing humanity.

Ukuphuhliswa kweAfghanistan,  ke  ngoko,  yenye  yemiba  engundoqo  elizweni
lonke. Zikhona nezinye iindawo  apho  abantu  basaxambulisanayo  khona,  nto
leyo ebangela ukuba kubekho  abantu  abaninzi  ababhubhayo.  I-ANC  ke  yona
ayizithandi iimfazwe ezigqubayo eAngola nakwiDemocratic Republic  of  Congo.
Asiyithandi nento eyenzeka kumazwe afana neSudan. (Translation  of  isiXhosa
paragraph follows.)

[The development of Afghanistan is one of the critical issues in the  world.
There are other  parts  of  the  world  where  strife  is  still  prevalent,
something which leads to the death of many people. The  ANC  does  not  like
the wars which are prevailing in Angola and the DRC. It also does  not  like
what is happening in countries like Sudan.]

We are happy to note that one of the important developments  of  the  Middle
East conflict, following the President's  recent  initiative,  is  that  the
peace  movement  in  that  part  of  the   world   has   been   strengthened
significantly.  May  more  peace-loving  Palestinians  and  Israelis   fully
endorse the ideal of an independent Palestine and an  Israeli  state  within
secure borders. In this context, allow me  to  acknowledge  the  many  South
Africans who have taken up this matter of abiding peace in the Middle East.

Asiluthandi uxambiliswano olwenzekayo elizweni xa  abantu  benakho  ukuhlala
phantsi  bathetha-thethane.  Njengokuba  sekutshiwo  amatyeli  aliqela  kule
Ndlu,  into  efunekayo  kukuba  abantu  bahlangane   basebenzise   ubuchopho
neendlela zobunono zokuthetha-thethana ukuze  zonke  izinto  ezibangela  olu
xambuliswano ibe zizinto  eziya  kuthi  zilungiswe.  Ndikhumbula,  ngakumbi,
amazwe uQabane uMongameli athethe ngawo ngoLwesihlanu.

Masingalibali ke njengabantu boMzantsi Afrika, ngakumbi abo bangamalungu  e-
ANC, ukuba zisekhona iindawo apho  olu  xambuliswano  neemfazwe  zisagqubayo
khona. Masikhumbule ke ngoko nabantu  beSahara  eseNtshona.  Siyavuma  ukuba
maxa wambi kuyanyanzeleka ukuba kubekho imfazwe xa ilizwe lifuna  ukulungisa
iindawo apho kusekho  uxambuliswano  khona.  Kodwa  ke  sithi  thina  izinto
ezinjalo kufuneka  zenzeke  phantsi  kwentonga  yeZizwe  eziManyeneyo,  emva
kokuba kuthetha-thethwene kwaboniswana ngendlela eyiyo. Ukuba  kusetyenziswa
izigalo, oko makuthabathe ixeshana elifutshane.  I-ANC  ayivumelani  namazwe
athi  aphume  ecaleni  aqale  imfazwe  ewodwa.  (Translation   of   isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[We do not like the strife which is taking place in the  world  when  people
can sit down and engage one another in a dialogue. As had been said  several
times in this House, what is necessary is that people should  get  together,
use the brain and skilled ways of dialogue so that  everything  that  causes
this strife become matters that are  rectified.  I  remember,  particularly,
the countries Comrade President referred to.

As Africans, especially those who are members of the ANC, let us not  forget
that there are still areas where strife and wars are still going on. Let  us
therefore also remember the people of the Western Sahara. We accept that  it
is, sometimes, inevitable that war takes  place  when  the  world  wants  to
restore order in areas where strife persists. However, we  are  saying  such
things should happen under the  guidance  of  the  UN,  after  dialogue  and
consultation on proper steps for doing so. If there is use of arms let  that
be for a short duration. The ANC does not agree  with  countries  that  step
out of line and, on their own, start war.]

The theme of the state  of  the  nation  address  was  poverty.  War  causes
poverty. There are other conditions that do the same, of  course,  including
the perpetuation of the divide between those who have and those who  do  not
have.
There are about 50 multinational corporations in the  world  whose  revenues
are more than the  budgets  of  two  thirds  of  the  world's  states.  This
reflects the unevenness of economic development in the  world,  a  disparity
that spawns poverty.  Great  numbers  of  the  world's  population  live  in
conditions of underdevelopment, poverty and squalor.

Amaxesha amaninzi uMongameli uye wazithi thaca  phambi  kwezizwe  zehlabathi
ezi zinto, apho ebesoloko esitsho ukuba kuyacaca  ukuba  kukho  amazwe  apho
kugquba  indyebo  namazwe  apho  kugquba  indlala.  Zonke  izinto   ezifunwa
ngabantu zifumaneka ngokuthi ubani ukweliphi na kula  macala  mabini.  Ukuba
ubani usuka kula mazwe apho indyebo  ingummangaliso  khona,  izinto  ezifana
nezindlu zokuhlala, ukutya,  imfundo,  unyango,  zizinto  ezifumaneka  lula.
Apho kugquba indlala zonke ezi zinto azifumaneki. (Translation  of  isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[The President has, on many occasions, tabled these things before the  world
nations, where he persistently  said  that  it  was  clear  that  there  are
countries where poverty prevailed, that everything that  people  needed  was
available, depending on which  one  of  the  two  sides  one  found  him  or
herself. If one came from a country where  wealth  was  amazing,  facilities
such as houses in which to sleep,  food,  education  and  health  care  were
readily available. Where poverty prevails these things are not available.]

It is this question and many others that we need to confront  as  individual
countries and  collectively  as  the  free  world  under  the  guidance  and
direction of the United Nations in order to strengthen democracy and  create
conditions of freedom, peace and justice for all the peoples of the globe.

The world has been listening.  There  has  been  contact  between  the  rich
nations and the poorer ones by way  of  partnerships  that  have  developed,
principally to help in the fight against poverty in  the  developing  world.
These  partnerships  have  opened  up  for  some  developing  countries  the
benefits of the process  of  globalisation.  Consequently,  space  has  been
created to facilitate entry into the world's economic markets.

Ngemizamo kaMongameli  noogxa  bakhe  kweli  lizwekazi  laseAfrika,  aliqela
amazwe  atyebileyo  athe  athembisa  ngokuza  kuncedisa  kwiinzame   zokulwa
indlala kumazwe asakhulayo. [Through the efforts of the  President  and  his
colleagues on the African continent, a few countries promised  to  come  and
help fight poverty in the developing countries.]

It is true that the opportunities that globalisation offers  the  developing
world have not translated into dramatic flows of foreign  direct  investment
into the developing world. No adequate funding has been forthcoming for  the
strengthening of the local developmental programmes. This  has  to  do  with
the fact that the partnerships we talk about have not always been equal  and
mutually beneficial.

At times they have been opportunistic and lopsided. This encourages,  rather
than obviates, the process in which the rich get richer with the poor  slide
further into  poverty  and  despair.  Poor  people,  lacking  education  and
skills, remain on the sidelines and  continue  to  suffer  the  ignominy  of
further marginalisation.

It is one  of  South  Africa's  responsibilities  to  help  rearrange  these
relationships so that in the end they  become  mutually  fulfilling.  Global
trends will have to change so that the wealth of the world services all  the
people in every corner of the globe.

South Africa must argue at every turn for the economic regeneration  of  the
African continent, using Nepad as a vehicle to achieve this. As  leaders  of
our people, meeting together in this House, let us call on  our  compatriots
united as a people  to  dedicate  their  skills,  talent  and  resources  to
engaging and defeating poverty and want. Let  us  motivate  them  to  invest
both human and material resources for the establishment  of  basic  economic
and social infrastructure.

In deciding its own obligations, the ANC-led Government will accelerate  its
programme of public works infrastructure development. We believe  that  many
of our compatriots will respond positively to this call, given that  we  are
united as a nation behind the noble goal of providing a better life for  all
our people.

We as South Africa must negotiate our  way  into  all  structures  of  power
internationally in order for us to help reshape the world  for  the  benefit
especially of the developing countries. World organisations such as  the  UN
and its organs must be restructured to accommodate  the  full  participation
of member states from the developing world. Let us be  among  the  champions
of  world  peace,  freedom,  democracy,  justice,  human  rights  and   good
governance.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, hon President, during  Friday's  speech  I  felt
like I was sitting in a  boardroom  of  a  big  company  with  the  managing
director delivering his report, which was  cold,  clinical  and  managerial.
Perhaps we must accept that this is the style of our Presidency, for  it  is
better than cheap populist rhetoric with much emotion and no substance.

But,  leading  a  country  is  more  than  managing  it.  It  is  more  than
statistics. It has to do with  perceptions,  feelings,  with  not  only  the
brains, but also the veins. It is not only about party supporters at an  ANC
rally, but it is about  other  patriots  as  well,  who  are  often  on  the
receiving end of transformation and change. They want to hear  the  head  of
state saying that there is a future for them and  their  children  and  what
they hold dear in this country.

Furthermore, it was clear from the President's address that he was  sticking
to his agenda, come what may. He would  not  allow  the  opposition  or  the
press to determine it. This is something positive to a certain extent.  But,
the President must remember that newspapers are  there  to  make  money  and
they will not write  about  matters  that  are  not  alive  in  the  public.
Opposition parties are also there to get votes and will not  campaign  about
matters that are not on the agenda of the South African constituency.

Ignoring the agenda of opposition parties ipso  factor  means  ignoring  the
wants, concerns and aspirations of citizens out  there  in  the  street  and
perhaps the investor abroad. Surely this is what  happened  with  regard  to
the lack of even the slightest  rebuke  of  the  tyrannical  Mugabe  regime.
Surely this is what happened in not crossing  the  Rubicon  with  regard  to
HIV/Aids. Other parties have elaborated sufficiently on this matter.

The AEB does acknowledge the positive aspects of  the  President's  address,
such as the call for moral regeneration, the recommitment  to  an  open  and
free economy, the proposed increase  in  social  pensions  and  decrease  in
taxes, the positive performance report by  Prof  Willie  Esterhuyse.  May  I
remind the President that next time he needs a praise-singer or an  imbongi,
he does not need to go to Stellenbosch. He has one at  hand  right  here  in
Parliament in the person of the hon leader of the New NP. [Laughter.]

So steun die AEB ook die President se oproep tot vrywillige  diens  aan  die
land. Dit is in die styl van Kennedy se ``it is what you  can  do  for  your
country''. Die President moet egter onthou dat dit nie net  bloot  individue
is wat vrywillig 'n  land  opbou  nie.  Dit  is  gemeenskappe  en  mense  in
georganiseerde  burgerlike  groepsverband.   Dit   is   bestuursliggame   en
inwonersverenigings en aksiegroepe in gemeenskappe.

Hierdie oproep van die President kan slegs slaag indien hierdie  instellinge
bemagtig word. Dit sal slegs gebeur indien  die  burgerlike  samelewing  nie
deur Big  Brother  gedomineer  word  nie  en  as  die  pluraliteit  van  die
samelewing in  sy  natuurlike  verband  erken  en  verdiskonteer  word.  Die
Afrikaner is deel van hierdie pluraliteit.

Hulle wil hulle bydrae maak tot die opbou van hierdie land wat hulle  heimat
is, hierdie land wat hul vaderland en enigste tuiste is. Hulle wil  nie  die
speelgoed uit die kot uitgooi net omdat die  ANC  aan  die  bewind  is  nie.
Hulle wil ook graag die hand van vriendskap  wat  uitgereik  word,  aanvaar.
Daar gebeur dinge wat dit baie moeilik maak. Ek wil net twee  sake  noem  en
vra die President se persoonlike aandag daarvoor.

Op een dag kondig die LUR vir plaaslike bestuur in die Noordelike  Provinsie
aan dat 14  dorpe  se  name  gaan  verander  -  'n  totale  etnies-kulturele
suiwering sonder enige raadpleging hoegenaamd. Die spoor van die  wawiel  en
die ryperd moet ten alle koste  uitgewis  word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[In this way the AEB  also  supports  the  President's  call  for  voluntary
service to the country. This follows in the style of Kennedy's ``it is  what
you can do for your country''. However, the President should  remember  that
it is not merely  individuals  who  voluntarily  uplift  a  country.  It  is
communities and people in organised civilian groups.  It  is  the  corporate
bodies and residential associations and action groups in communities.

This call of the President  can  only  succeed  if  these  institutions  are
empowered. This will only happen if the civil society is  not  dominated  by
Big Brother, and if the plurality of  society  in  its  natural  context  is
recognised and negotiated. The Afrikaners are part of this plurality.

They would like to make  a  contribution  towards  the  upliftment  of  this
country which is their birth country, this land which  is  their  fatherland
and only home. They would not like to  throw  their  toys  out  of  the  cot
merely because the ANC is in power. They would also like to accept the  hand
of friendship which is being extended. There are  some  things  that  happen
that make this very difficult. I would like to refer  to  just  two  matters
and request the President's personal attention in this regard.

In one day the MEC for local government in the Northern  Province  announced
that 14 towns would have a name change - a  total  ethno-cultural  cleansing
without any consultation whatsoever. The tracks of the wagon wheel  and  the
horse must be eradicated at all costs.]

I asked the MEC for an interview that very same day and I am  still  waiting
today. So much for transparency! One by one names are changed  and  cultural
cleansing takes its course. The limit  is  Potgietersrus,  now  bearing  the
name of the very man who murdered Potgieter  and  his  family.  It  is  like
changing the name of Verwoerdburg to Tsafendas City - so  much  for  nation-
building,  so much for reaching out, so much for taking our national  slogan
seriously, ``unity in diversity''.

Die tweede saak wat ek kortliks wil noem,  is  die  toename  in  ongegronde,
kwaadwillige arrestasies van veral boere wat hulself  teen  plaasmoordenaars
verdedig.  Mnr  Ben  Coe  en  sy  twee  seuns  is  verlede  week  langs  die
hospitaalbed van hulle  ernstig  beseerde  moeder  in  Warmbad  in  hegtenis
geneem, ná 'n onderonsie met ses gewapende rowers. Sulke gevalle kom al  hoe
meer voor. Moet ons wag vir 'n tweede Slagtersnek voordat ons  hieraan  gaan
aandag skenk?

Derduisende Afrikaners is besig en staan gereed om  'n  deurslaggewende  rol
te speel om van Suid-Afrika 'n wenland  te  maak,  vir  al  sy  mense.  Mooi
woorde  kan  daartoe  bydra,  mits  dit  nie  geloënstraf  word   deur   die
werklikheid van die lewe  in  Suid-Afrika  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The second matter which I would briefly like to refer to, is  the  increase
in  unfounded,  malicious  arrests,  particularly  of  several  farmers  who
defended themselves against farm murderers. Last week Mr  Ben  Coe  and  his
two sons were arrested next to the hospital bed of their  seriously  injured
mother in Warmbaths, following  a  scuffle  with  six  armed  robbers.  Such
instances  are  occurring  more  and  more.  Must  we  wait  for  a   second
Slagtersnek before we pay attention to this?

Thousands of Afrikaners are in the process of playing and are ready to  play
a significant role in order to make South Africa a winning country, for  all
its people. Beautiful words can contribute to this, provided these  are  not
belied by the reality of life in South Africa.]

As they say in isiZulu, ``izandla ziyagezana'' - [the  one  hand  needs  the
other to be washed]. [Applause.]

The  MINISTER  FOR  INTELLIGENCE:  Madam  Speaker,  Mr   President,   Deputy
President  and  members  of  Parliament,  hours  after  the  President   had
completed his state of the nation address last week  on  Friday,  my  office
received reports from across the country about the responses of  our  people
to the call the President  made  for  providing  voluntary  service  to  the
public and the nation.

From the Western Cape alone we received a  report  that  1  223  people  had
already volunteered and were already being used by police stations in  crime
prevention and other related administrative activities at  police  stations.
[Applause.]

At KwaZakhele township in Port Elizabeth, 500 people have  already  reported
as reservists to date. In Moroka we have  550  in  Soweto  and  in  Pretoria
Central 600. [Applause.]

More reports of this kind are being collected and will be available for  the
public. Judging by this response, by the end of the month the ranks  of  the
reservists should swell well over the  mark  of  30 000,  as  the  President
predicted on Friday.

The substance of the  reports  indicates  that  our  people  have  begun  to
respond positively and in numbers to the call the President  made.  This  is
also  indicative  of  the  potential  that   voluntarism   holds   for   the
preservation of national security, peace and stability in this country.

There are touching stories of ordinary citizens who are reporting crime  and
assisting in its solution, of mothers reporting the criminal  activities  of
their children and handing them over to the police. I would like to  say  to
the President that, as the ANC,  we  are  very  pleased  and  proud  of  the
actions of our people in this regard. In acting in  such  an  unselfish  and
patriotic manner, they have begun to show that the eradication of  crime  is
first and foremost the responsibility of the community itself.

``Arise and act'' is how  the  President  captured  this  spirit  that  must
prevail in our  communities  in  recognising  that  we  ourselves  have  the
responsibility of changing our lives. May  I  say  this  to  the  President:
There is something absolutely wonderful about the human spirit,  that  faced
with a challenge, we come together  and  respond  with  such  solidarity  to
overcome. There is something so wonderful too about being  a  South  African
and being part of this great surge to inexorably shape our  destiny  despite
all the pessimism which we hear from some sectors here.

The ANC has declared this month the month of safety and  security.  This  is
intended to mobilise South Africans around the most basic principle  of  our
struggle, a clarion call to all our patriotic men and women to come  to  the
defence  of  our  national  institutions,  our  national  sovereignty,   the
Constitution and our people.

Ours is a clarion call to  ordinary  South  Africans  to  come  together  to
defend our children, especially the most vulnerable, the girl child. And  as
the hon Wilma Newhoudt-Druchen so eloquently  said  yesterday,  we  have  to
ensure that every adult in each community would regard each child  as  their
own, so that our children may be protected from whatever harm  could  injure
their innocent lives.

In this context, allow me to provide the House with a bird's-eye view  of  a
case that shook South Africa because of its brutality and heinousness -  the
case of baby Tsepang. The social fabric that underpins the story  points  to
the heart of what the President always talks about: the  need  to  eradicate
poverty, without which we do not have any hope for  renewal.  The  story  of
baby Tsepang points  to  an  intricate  web  of  the  interconnectedness  of
poverty and alcohol abuse, an unfortunate coupling so prevalent  in  certain
sections of our society.

Baby Tsepang is 11 months old. Her mother is 16 years old,  her  grandmother
is 32 years old and her great-grandmother is  only  62  years  old.  Tsepang
lives in a one-roomed house with 14 other people. The  house  doubles  as  a
shebeen during the day and the  great-grandmother  is  the  proprietor.  The
sale of cheap alcohol is the main source of  income  for  the  household.  A
couple that shares the house is also known in the area for peddling drugs.

There is a four-year-old in the  family  of  Tsepang  who,  because  of  the
social circumstances in the home, has the language capacity of  a  two-year-
old, attributable to stunted growth arising from this environment.  In  this
environment the setting was right for the social calamity that descended  on
all of us South Africans on 26 October 2001, when  baby  Tsepang  was  raped
and the line which distinguishes  us  as  humans  from  the  animal  kingdom
became blurred.

On a daily basis, in such brutal ways, we are confronted  with  this  nexus.
We must indeed, Mr President, ever so urgently push  at  the  boundaries  of
poverty.

The case of baby Tsepang illustrates that crimes such as these emanate  from
a social environment  that  make  policing  absolutely  impossible.  As  the
President indicated, most crimes happen  between  Friday  and  Sunday  among
people who know each other, many of them under the influence of  alcohol  or
drugs.

What was not said in the President's speech  on  Friday,  is  that  most  of
these cases that do find their way to the police are withdrawn  by  Tuesday,
because of fear of reprisal or because of the  economic  dependence  of  the
victims on the perpetrator. The unfortunate  message  that  comes  out  when
these cases are withdrawn is that our communities  have  begun  to  tolerate
crime. They make the perpetrators feel that they are  beyond  the  reach  of
the law and that they can continue daringly. This  results  in  a  very  low
conviction rate for these social fabric crimes within our  criminal  justice
system.

At present our Government is working round the  clock  to  ensure  that  our
child protection strategies are  up  and  going.  These  would  include  the
implementation  of  a  child  protection  register  in  all  the  provinces,
guidelines on  the  notification  of  alleged  child  abuse  cases  and  the
rationalisation of national and provincial structures for child protection.

We as the ANC make a clarion call for every community not  only  to  protect
their property, but to ensure that the commodities  that  are  brought  into
the community are accounted for so that no community perpetuates  crimes  by
buying stolen goods. Every community, we are asking, should make  sure  that
public property such  as  schools  and  clinics  are  protected  from  being
vandalised.

At the centre of the ANC's campaign is the objective to build a patriot  who
knows that he or she is responsible to ensure the security of all  who  live
in South Africa.

Topping the list in this  regard,  are  the  multiple  threats  against  our
economy and prosperity. Hon members know about  the  recent  attack  on  our
currency and about the patriotism that Kevin Wakeford potrayed when he  came
across information  that  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  the  Myburgh
Commission. We in the intelligence services are forever  grateful  for  this
kind of co-operation.

Crime continues to be a problem and a challenge which  we  are  faced  with.
But there are  clear  indications  that  we  are  winning.  My  intelligence
community tells me this, Minister Tshwete tells  me  this  every  day,  even
Minister Buthelezi tells me this, and I am  quite  certain  that  very  soon
members of the community will be telling me this.

Perceptions  about  the  crime  level  have  conditioned  us   to   respond,
unfortunately, in a way that I  find  inappropriate,  because  it  makes  it
impossible for us to look beyond the present problem and look at  the  gains
that we have accomplished.

I just want, for a minute, to go beyond our borders and say  that  we  as  a
country have a great deal to be grateful for. We as a country, are  offering
a great deal of hope  to  the  people  of  the  continent  because  we  have
attained the level of stability that makes it possible for us to  have  this
kind of hope. We have been able to contribute to the  normalisation  of  the
lives of the people of Burundi. Our soldiers are out there  ensuring,  on  a
daily basis, that the truce holds.

We are a beacon of hope even in far-flung areas like the Middle East,  where
we had the opportunity to share with the people our own experiences  and  to
create in them the hope that their insurmountable problems  can  indeed  one
day come to an end.

With one and a half minutes left, I want to say that the hon Tony Leon  came
here yesterday brandishing a newspaper that quoted the President as  saying:
``I will not let Zim down''. I do not know what was meant by  that.  Because
indeed we will not let Zimbabwe down. This is  exactly  what  the  President
has been preaching. As the hon Tony Leon has been criticising  the  lack  of
progress by this Government in Zimbabwe,  what  has  his  open-mouth  policy
done in Zimbabwe? Nothing.

I can tell him what this  Government  has  done.  This  Government  has  put
together a team of high-profile people, ranging from the clergy  to  judges,
and ordinary citizens, to go to Zimbabwe to ensure that  indeed  the  people
of Zimbabwe are able to vote and that they are able to have a free and  fair
election to the extent that it is possible for us to ensure  that  free  and
fair election. Hon Leon must note  that  Africa  has  no  place  for  cowboy
politics. This he must learn and live with.

Hon Tony Leon was probably too young, but the history of where we come  from
tells us about the value of  quiet  diplomacy.  We  are  where  we  are  now
because the beginnings of our peace and our peace processes  had,  at  their
heart, quiet diplomacy.

[Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson,  hon  President  and  Deputy  President,  hon
members from different portfolios, colleagues,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  our
humanity has taught us that people help each other no matter how  much  they
hate each other. We thank our ancestors and God  for  having  protected  our
leaders until today. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr  Tony  Leon,  and  his
family have been blessed by God at a  time  when  they  lost  their  mother,
Sheila, the mother of Tony and Peter, his elder brother.

We give our thanks to God for saving and protecting  President  Thabo  Mbeki
in the face of death in a car accident. If one narrowly escapes death  while
one is still alive, the elders say that he or  she  will  live  for  a  long
time. May you live very long, Sizi]

The overall thematic message of this year's state of the nation  address  is
African unity, despite the many instances where hatred is  spewed  by  many.
African unity brings to the fore related visionary ideals  and  values  such
as the African Renaissance and a caring society, the  much-spoken-of  ubuntu
and the adage ``matlo-gosha mabapi'', meaning that a person is  his  or  her
brother's or sister's keeper.

Throughout  the  ages  the  nations  have  been  inspired  to  have  dreams.
Underlying  these  dreams  or  visions  are   responsibilities   that   have
challenged humankind and its leaders intensely. The mere  theme  itself  may
throw our memories as far back as the distant past of Greek  mythology.  Was
not Themis the goddess of law and justice? Without  law  and  justice  there
can never be any sustainable peace, stability and  unity  or  order.  Mother
Africa, including this country, has to recognise that.

Unity has contradictory tensions of its own which must be  faced  truthfully
without fear or favour. Tensions can  be  described  more  or  less  by  two
words: estrangement and reconciliation. Reflection and introspection  should
never be misconstrued as pessimism, lest we stifle  free  thought  and  free
speech.

The word ``estrangement'' is normally used to describe any kind of  disunity
among human beings: war among nations, conflict among classes  and  personal
alienation. It also follows that  when  the  leaders  of  one  nation  covet
territory held by another nation, or when one class resents the easier  life
of other classes, demands are, and will be, placed on political leadership.

Briefly,  Webster's  dictionary  gives  ``reconcile''  as  an   antonym   of
``estrangement''.   Someone   said   that   ``politics   is   the   art   of
reconciliation''. The need for this art always  arises  from  some  kind  of
estrangement. Seemingly all  political  problems  are  therefore  rooted  in
situations of estrangement.

We do have our share of problems, as the President  has  mentioned,  and  we
cannot  be  deaf,  dumb  and  blind  to  what  happens  in   our   immediate
neighbourhood in the southern region of this continent. In  Swaziland  there
is simmering. Zimbabwe has taken the form of a volcano. There are more  than
rumblings. This volcano is exuding lava and deadly gases  that  may  pervade
and engulf us, their very own  neighbours!  No  African  country  should  be
allowed to turn the African dream into a  nightmare,  whether  or  not  they
hosted us during our liberation struggle. [Interjections.]

We  have  debated  the  issue  of  robust  or  vocal  diplomacy,   and   the
Government's somewhat come-softly or quiet diplomacy. The great  tragedy  in
Zimbabwe is that the  things  that  make  for  peace,  namely  progress  and
stability, are thwarted by the total disregard of the things that  make  our
Constitution the guiding light  of  many  free  nations,  and  that  is  the
fundamental and entrenched freedoms, with almost a sacred  respect  for  the
rule of law, an unfettered media, respect for the judiciary, and  last,  but
not least, the respect and protection by the state of every  citizen's  life
and property.

To paraphrase the President's idiom, free and fair  elections  are  not  the
outcome of pressing a button. Free and fair elections must take place  in  a
certain conducive condition and climate where each citizen  will,  uncoerced
and unintimidated, exercise their hard-won right to vote.  These  conditions
and climate are not an overnight act. A continuous period of not  less  than
one year is needed to create such a climate, and calling it  off  a  day  or
two before polling day does not contradict this.

With the limited time I have, I also want to say that  despite  our  fervour
to heal and lead this continent, this country is hurting too much,  and  has
a great deal of unfinished business which is crying out for attention  right
here at home. [Interjections.] A quick shopping list of what should be  done
needs attention. I refer here to the many returnees from exile,  and  cadres
and  combatants,  some  able-bodied  and  others  not,  languishing  in  the
Sowetos, the Lumanyanengs and other remote areas of this  country,  who  are
uncared for. Thanks for the special pensions,  but  these  are  not  fishing
rods to enable these people to fish for themselves.

We also should remember the orphans  that  are  stranded  on  the  continent
abroad who  cannot  come  home  to  their  motherland,  South  Africa,  and,
painfully, the ashes and graves of those who will  never  touch  our  shores
again for they are departed, unknown and unsung.

A badimo ba se ke ba re furalela. [Let the gods  not  turn  their  backs  on
this country.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER  IN  THE  PRESIDENCY:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  Comrades
President and Deputy President, the hon Mr Tony Leon said to the  President:
``Friday's address to this House left me convinced  that  we  exist  in  two
realities.'' Yes, we do! Not only now, but also in the past.

Whilst so many brave and heroic South Africans resisted  the  might  of  the
apartheid state between 1975 and 1977, the realities of Mr Leon's world  can
be judged from the hymns of praise  heaped  by  him  on  the  apartheid  war
machine and the policy of Bantustans. [Interjections.] A  revealing  article
by author Ronald Suresh Roberts in the Financial Mail records  Leon's  songs
of praise during  his  stint  as  a  mustard-keen  young  reporter  for  the
official SADF journal Paratus, while  Soweto's  youngsters  were  being  cut
down by army and police bullets in their thousands.

Under the headline ``Our Magnificent Air Taxis'' in June 1976,  to  describe
the illegal invasion of Angola, hon Leon wrote:


  On board are 20 SADF personnel eagerly awaiting their arrival at  a  base
  near the border, in order to proceed onwards to given  destinations.  The
  flight whets their appetite for the adventures that lie ahead.

[Interjections.] Also in 1976, he praised the fact  that  the  parliamentary
wives of the NP, United Party and  Progressive  Reform  Party  were  working
together for the war. He mentioned Mrs Andries Treurnicht, whose husband  of
course soon left the NP because P W Botha was, in his view, too liberal.

On the sham independence of the Transkei, under the  headline  ``The  SADF's
Magnificent Participation'', he wrote:


  When  Paramount  Chief  Kaiser  Matanzima,  the  Transkei's  first  Prime
  Minister, addressed the country from the stadium's podium, shortly  after
  the ochre, white and green Transkeian flag had been  hoisted,  eight  25-
  pounder guns of 142 Battery,  14th  Field  Regiment,  Potchefstroom,  had
  fired the 101-gun salute.

[Interjections.] Presumably, Mr Leon was not around to record the fact  that
the Ciskei had worse luck: its flagpole ominously  broke  when  it  followed
Transkei to bogus independence not  long  after.  [Interjections.]  The  hon
Leon continued to underline the spirit in which the  SADF  had  assisted  in
the birth of the so-called Republic of Transkei. I quote:


  Never before has such a new state been born with such goodwill and common
  purpose.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

The MINISTER: [Interjections.] The hon Leon ends, and I quote:


  A Xhosa woman ...

No name, not ``an African woman'', not ``a  black  woman'',  but  ``a  Xhosa
woman'' -


  ... who had journeyed from Port St Johns to see the freedom  celebrations
  in Umtata summed up the  significant  SADF  involvement  thus:  ``It  was
  wonderful to see the soldiers, bands and planes. For us it was worthwhile
  to come this way and observe such a sight.''

[Interjections.] And I suppose he calls Mr Seremane ``Mr Tswane''.  Yes,  Mr
Leon, there were two realities then, as there are  now:  one  big,  generous
and all-embracing, and one very small. [Interjections.]

May I briefly refer to  the  hon  Mr  Bantu  Holomisa.  It  is  one  of  the
scandalous ironies of our democracy that one who  snatched  power  with  the
barrel of a gun and, as  I  understand  it,  with  the  help  of  some  very
unsavoury characters, now parades in this House as a democrat interested  in
the wellbeing of our people. A person who  made  very  little  endeavour  to
improve the lives of people in his captive Bantustan  has  the  temerity  to
stand here and make the most disgraceful, unwarranted,  unsubstantiated  and
vilified attacks on this Government and its President. If I were one of  the
dwindling number of people in the UDM, I would be ashamed. [Interjections.]

To move to responsibilities closer to my heart,  we  in  the  communications
field warmly welcome  criticism  of  our  performance.  We  take  note  when
independent  quarters,  such  as  academics  from  Stellenbosch  University,
quoted  by  the  President  in  his   speech,   offer   criticism   of   our
effectiveness,  suggesting  that,  and  I  quote:  ``...  communication   by
Government is not always optimum ...''

We do not respond over-defensively, but look at what we are doing, so as  to
improve the record we are  presenting  to  the  nation.  By  ``we''  I  mean
communicators  in  the  Presidency,  in  the  Government  Communication  and
Information  System,   and   Government,   departmental   and   ministerial,
communicators across the board.
We are wary of relying on  spin  and  soundbites  in  getting  our  messages
across, and it is no secret that  the  President  dislikes  shallowness  and
promotions tricks. We believe that the democratic cause in South  Africa  is
just and the effort to achieve delivery and nationhood  sincere,  so  we  do
not have to spin our story like a silkworm spins its silk, often to  end  up
cocooned and trapped inside.

Some countries employ greater spin in their  communication  efforts,  and  I
say good luck to them. They employ celebrity figures at great cost  to  give
their story maximum impact. But some may well find that  they  overspin  and
become  obfuscators  of  the  very  thing  they  are   trying   to   pursue,
enlightenment. So we have chosen the road of providing the fullest  possible
information, but in alignment with integrity and sincerity.

Our message is simple and convincing: A free, strong and  committed  African
spirit,  working  in  co-operation  with  our  sisters  and   brothers   for
development  and  progress  on  the  continent.  We   seek   to   relay   it
informatively, and not by stretching fact into fiction.

The state of the nation speech provides an informative  mid-term  report  as
we enter the second half of the current  administration.  The  speech  shows
that we are moving ahead, that delivery of services  and  goods,  especially
for the very poor and the ailing, is being steadily achieved.

The GCIS did a detailed analysis of media expectations  before  the  speech,
and their comments afterwards. I am very glad to  report  that  the  overall
response has been favourable. That is encouraging. The  speech  goes  beyond
chronicling delivery. It concerns me and you. It exhorts all our  people  to
see themselves as part of the effort to renew our land  and  cope  with  new
challenges in a changed and more menacing global dispensation.

The hon the President called  on  people  to  arise  and  act.  He  stressed
volunteerism, saying that, and I quote, ``No one, and no one, can do for  us
what we should do for ourselves.'' He sought to change a  mindset  in  terms
of which the Government is expected, on its own,  to  right  all  evils  and
rise to all challenges. He sought partnership between  the  people  and  the
Government.

The long-standing slogan of the ANC is ``Amandla Ngawethu'' - power  to  the
people. That is the golden thread that has given the ANC its raison  d'être,
its purpose, in South African life, and it is the force which  lives  on  as
we move from transition to  transformation  of  our  whole  country.  To  be
empowered, people need to  be  informed  and  inspired.  The  President  has
provided inspiration. It is up to the Government and other communicators  to
provide the information, to give further shape  and  form  to  the  national
will. It is, moreover, up to the people to take decisions  about  their  own
lives and to use the available information to empower  themselves,  to  have
better lives.

It is no accident that this Presidential call to action comes close  on  the
heels of successful imbizos held in various provinces, most recently in  the
Eastern  Cape.  These  imbizos   accept   the   important   principle   that
communication is not one-way, from the Government to the  people,  but  two-
way, involving people and the Government they elected.

A network of all-purpose, one-stop  communication  centres,  driven  by  the
GCIS, increasingly links the people to the administration  of  the  country.
This helps in the general cause of ensuring enlightenment of and passing  on
of knowledge to the people. That is power to the people.

The Presidency has improved the flow of information with briefings  for  the
media, both domestic and foreign. Right now we are setting up a press  corps
which will, amongst other things, give sustained access  to  the  words  and
deeds of the Presidency. We need to give journalists greater access  to  the
corridors of power, and to take them into the confidence of  the  Government
as far as possible, but in ways that leave  the  independence  of  both  the
Government and the media intact.

We are about to legislate for a  media  development  and  diversity  agency,
which  will  foster  diversity  and,  therefore,  growth   of   the   media,
particularly in areas that are currently badly served, if at  all.  This  we
shall do in partnership with the private sector,  which  enjoys  significant
co-involvement in the project and whose  problems,  such  as  the  rocketing
price of paper, we  do  appreciate  and  seek  to  assist  with  as  far  as
possible.

We wish to help wherever we can in  the  great  national  task  of  bringing
knowledge and power to the people -  and  ensuring  their  ready  access  to
communication tools so as to be able to do  their  jobs  as  citizens  in  a
democracy. Amandla!

HON MEMBERS: Ngawethu! [It’s ours.] [Applause.]

Mr  P  F  SMITH:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,  colleagues,  if  we  are
fortunate, debates in this House can be very constructive. They can  reflect
genuine engagement between persons holding opposing views;  they  can  bring
about mutual understanding; and, they can result in a real sharing of  ideas
and moving forward together. But in respect of the  matter  I  am  going  to
raise yet again today, we are holding what we call  an  unfortunate  debate.
It will not be constructive, there will be no engagement; and no meeting  of
minds and we will not be moving forward together.

Indeed, we have collectively become participants here in a ritual  -  actors
mouthing lines. There is, in fact, an inevitability about  it  all.  We  say
what we say, and he ignores us. He says what he says and we  do  not  accept
it. In reality, we talk past each other, but we  are  not  equally  culpable
because the truth of the matter is - I would like to say to the President  -
we are right on this and he is wrong. I say this not because he  is  failing
to do what the IFP wants him to do, but because he is failing to do what  he
himself has promised to do and is not doing it. [Interjections.]

It would not surprise me one iota if the President does not  respond  to  my
inputs today. Perhaps he will, perhaps he will not. Who knows? But it  makes
no difference because we always talk past each other. The debate  serves  no
useful purpose, in fact, other than to remind the President of the  Republic
and members of his party, as well the public of this country, that  some  of
us are holding the President accountable to do what he has promised  to  do:
to give effect to  the  promise  he  made  to  the  representatives  of  the
Coalition of Traditional Leaders shortly  before  the  December  2000  local
government elections, to be a man of his word, to be a man of honour, to  be
a man of integrity, the statesman we all hope he is.

In the 15 months that have elapsed since the  President  and  the  coalition
reached the agreement that they did, nothing has happened to give effect  to
it. I repeat: Nothing has happened to give effect to that agreement  reached
between the President and the  coalition.  [Interjections.]  The  Government
has indeed introduced legislation purportedly dealing with the matter.  But,
in reality, these Bills have been absolutely irrelevant. Indeed, one was  so
awful that one would hope that those who drafted it would have the  courtesy
of at least appearing embarrassed when it is presented to us.

Amongst other things, it  purported  to  give  traditional  authorities  the
following powers. I quote: the powers  to   ``facilitate  the  gathering  of
fire   wood'';   ``co-ordinate   first-fruit   ceremonies'';   ``co-ordinate
rainmaking  ceremonies'';  and  ``co-ordinate  the  clearing  of   fields''.
[Laughter.]

During  the  negotiations  preceding  the  agreement  reached  between   the
President and the  coalition,  it  was  agreed  by  both  sides  -  and  the
department itself was involved - that traditional authorities  in  fact  and
in law exercised the same powers - local government powers and  functions  -
as did municipalities.

The draft Bill whose clauses I have just read out  was  intended,  seriously
intended, by Government to be accepted by traditional leaders  -  on  behalf
of the traditional authorities - as  a  substitute  for  the  full  loss  of
powers and functions that was about to  happen  on  5  December.  It  is  an
absolute insult, but that is the attitude we are having to contend with.

This legislative - shall we call it - ``drivel'' reflects the contempt  with
which Government is dealing with traditional leaders. [Interjections.]  This
attitude has also  been  reflected  in  the  paucity  of  consultation  with
traditional leaders  from  the  stage  at  which  these  negotiations  first
commenced. It is being reflected in the lack  of  progress  in  the  Cabinet
committee, or subcommittee dealing with the matter, and it is reflected,  in
constant attempts by Government to ignore the basic tenets of the  agreement
reached. [Interjections.] If one does not like what I  am  saying,  one  can
just be quiet. I am just telling hon members the facts. [Laughter.]

In his 29-page address on Friday on the state of the nation,  the  President
found time in one half-sentence to refer to this issue.  He  said  that  the
system of democratic  governance  would  be  strengthened,  inter  alia,  by
resolving the issue ``of the place and role of  our  traditional  system  of
Government''. [Interjections.]
It has been an open secret that yet another Bill - I do not know whether  it
is the third or the fourth one - is now doing its rounds  as  a  draft.  And
while it is true that we have not had sight of this Bill  and  while  it  is
true that one would normally reserve one's comments until one has had  sight
of a Bill, I think we have no doubt, based on our experience and based  upon
the  fact  that  Government  is  making  absolutely  no  commitment  to  the
constitutional amendment that is required to bring about the changes  needed
- that this Bill will not resolve anything at all.

I say this because the IFP, at least, was  under  the  impression  that  the
matter had already been resolved, in that the Government and  the  President
had committed themselves to an agreement which achieved two specific  goals.
The first of these goals was that all  those  local  government  powers  and
functions that were about to be obliterated on 5 December, would,  in  fact,
be restored. The second objective,  which  would  happen  subsequently,  was
that the powers and functions of traditional authorities would be  increased
thereafter.

The joint effect of these twin sets of interventions was in  fact  that  the
issue would be resolved once  and  for  all.  The  place  and  role  of  the
traditional leaders and traditional authorities would be resolved  once  and
for all in our system of government. All that is required in terms  of  this
agreement is in fact to implement the legislation;  draft  the  legislation,
table it before the House, and then we have progress.

Now, instead of complying with both the process  and  the  content  of  this
agreement, the President appears to have done little  other  than  to  shift
the responsibility to others  such  as  the  the  Deputy  Minister,  to  the
Minister for Provincial and Local Government - who is not  listening  -  and
also to the Deputy President. He has effectively washed  his  hands  of  the
matter. One is indeed left with an overwhelming impression of  a  government
doing its utmost to wriggle out of a commitment made. It is of a  government
wanting to start afresh by rejecting that which it has  earlier  agreed  to.
It is of a government, frankly, whose word cannot - in this matter at  least
- be trusted. And the reason one gets  this  impression  is  that  the  very
person who put his name to the agreement is now seemingly the person who  is
no longer prepared to implement it.

One gets the impression that the President shares the view of his  protégée,
the hon the Minister for Provincial and Local Government,  that  traditional
leaders are a nuisance who should be seen and not heard.  Why  is  it,  that
notwithstanding all the commendable  stress  in  his  state  of  the  nation
address on the need to redress poverty and underdevelopment,  the  worse  of
which of course occurs in the rural areas, not one  word  was  said  of  the
positive role that traditional authorities and traditional leaders can  play
in respect of improving delivery? It is because they do not count.

The IFP is convinced that traditional authorities can deliver.  The  IFP  is
equally convinced that  traditional  authorities  can  embody  the  best  of
African direct democracy. There are clearly some bad eggs and clearly  there
is a need to regulate the system within an appropriate statutory  framework.
To reject the entire system is as irrational as rejecting the entire  system
of municipal government  on  the  basis  that  some  municipalities  do  not
deliver or some councillors are corrupt. The  point  is  that  we,  as  this
Parliament,  have  spent  the  past  eight  years  collectively  devising  a
sophisticated,  seemingly  never-ending  legislative  framework  for   local
government to deliver, supported by a couple  of  hundreds  of  billions  of
rands in public funds -  the  Minister  of  Finance  could  give  the  exact
figures - in order for local governments to deliver.

The question we should ask ourselves is:  What  have  we  done  to  underpin
delivery by traditional authorities? And the answer we should all accept  is
this: Zilch! Or something very close to approaching zilch. That is  why  the
issue is as we find it today.

In our view the issue has nothing to do with the  intrinsic  merits  of  the
argument  or  otherwise.  It  is  ideologically  driven,  seemingly  by  the
President himself, who holds the view expressed in his address at the  ANC's
90th anniversary, in which he claimed:


  Traditional leaders would have to break out  of  the  impulse  towards  a
  narrow world of tribal identity and self-fulfilment  within  this  closed
  world and understand the extraordinary national and  international  tasks
  that face every South African patriot.

If that is what the  President  believes,  that  is  what  he  believes.  No
problem, but this should not allow us to justify his  refusal  to  implement
an agreement that he reached as the President of the Republic,  and  not  as
the president of the ANC, with the coalition of  traditional  leaders.  That
promise stands and that promise, incidentally, like another promise  entered
into  by  another  ANC  president  before  the   1994   elections,   remains
unfulfilled. Clearly some things have become habitual with ANC presidents.

I am nearly finished, which will make the Minister very  happy.  By  way  of
conclusion, if the President does respond,  he  would  be  doing  us  all  a
favour if he could avoid the generalities and answer just one very  specific
question. The answer to this question will  determine  whether  the  IFP  is
judging him fairly or judging  him  unfairly.  That  question  is:  Has  the
President  instructed  or  does  he  intend  instructing  his  Ministers  to
introduce legislation which will restore the  local  government  powers  and
functions exercised by traditional authorities and  traditional  leaders  in
the period leading up to 5 December? Let me repeat the  question:  Will  the
President instruct or has he instructed or does he  intend  instructing  his
Ministers to introduce legislation which will restore the  local  government
powers and functions exercised by  traditional  authorities  in  the  period
leading up to the elections of 5 December  2000?  [Interjections.]  That  is
the question which we would like him  to  answer;  anything  else  would  be
irrelevant. [Applause.]

Mr N M NENE: Madam Speaker, hon President of the Republic of  South  Africa,
and hon members, it is unfortunate, indeed, that the  hon  member  Mr  Smith
raised the issue that he has raised. In the same speech from which  he  read
only one line, it was said that this matter is one of the matters  that  are
going to be laid to rest during the course of this year.

In the state of the nation address, the President elaborately dealt  with  a
number of issues and challenges facing our  country.  Key  among  these  was
economic development and job creation. When  the  ANC  came  into  power  in
1994, we inherited an economy riddled with  serious  problems  such  as  the
inequitable distribution of wealth, skewed government spending in favour  of
a section of society and a deliberate neglect of the other.

I do not want to repeat what the President has said, but  we  cannot  ignore
the progress that we, as a  nation,  have  made  in  addressing  the  social
backlogs that we inherited from the apartheid past.

The ANC-led Government's commitment to achieving higher  rates  of  economic
growth  and  development  is  premised  on  the  already  growing   domestic
investments. The Ngqurha industrial development zone is  but  one  of  those
projects that are already under way, as the President mentioned.

Along with this project is a precision  stainless  steel  centre,  which  is
facilitated by one of Germany's largest industrial centres,  Ferrostaal  AG.
This  project  is  a  highly  specialised  downstream  activity  that   will
concentrate on precision cut, especially hardened steel  strips  and  foils.
Its products will produce precision  materials  that  are  compensators  for
automotive and industrial use. The investment value of this project is  R900
million. The jobs that will be created will be more than 220.

In the Free State, British Aerospace Systems and  SAAB  are  facilitating  a
gold beneficiation jewellery project.  This  project  involves  one  of  our
leading domestic gold producers, Mintek, and will  be  producing  high-value
gold products and jewellery for export  markets.  The  investment  value  of
that project is R1 billion and it will create more than 1 000 jobs.

BAE and SAAB are also facilitating another R600 million project, which  will
support the commercialisation of a locally developed biochemical process  to
extract protein from soya beans. It is expected that 70% of  the  production
will be exported. The total investment value exceeds R600 million.

In Pietermaritzburg, Thyssen, a large German multinational, is  facilitating
an investment project which involves the manufacturing  of  aluminium  tubes
for application to automotive radiators. This construction is  now  complete
and full production will be commencing within weeks.  The  investment  value
is in excess of R22 million.

The export of value-added products is  expected  to  increase  significantly
during the year as a result of the Industrial Participation  Programme.  One
highly successful export venture is by ABB, the  Swiss  multinational.  This
project is again facilitated by BAE and SAAB, and it involves the export  of
high-value power generation equipment. Already, exports in  excess  of  R500
million have been achieved and are expected  to  grow  to  approximately  R1
billion per annum.

There are many more, but  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  of  unemployment
requires that more be done in this respect. Unemployment needs to be  fought
from all angles.

The Human Resources Development Programme has benefited tens  of  thousands,
and must be intensified in  order  to  achieve  sustainable  employment  and
economic growth. The promotion of SMMEs  and  informal  employment  is  also
critical. Agriculture has been identified as a growth sector  by  Government
in the Integrated Rural Development Programme. Big business needs  to  enter
into partnerships with emerging entrepreneurs. The projects in the 13  rural
nodes, which the President identified, are already making  a  difference  in
our communities. I come from one of those districts  where  there  are  such
projects, the Umzinyathi Regional Council.

The community-based job creation projects are pushing back the frontiers  of
poverty and a better life is being realised  indeed.  These  programmes  and
many more  will  go  a  long  way  in  collectively  dealing  with  problems
confronting us.

Economic growth still remains a challenge as acknowledged in the address  by
the President. A 6% growth rate has never been achieved in  our  economy  in
the past 20 years that we have records of, but we are always told that  this
is the only growth that will produce employment.  The  projected  2%  growth
rate is only realistic and achievable. We trust that the growth summit  will
also assist in mobilising all stakeholders to build  a  better  economy  for
all of us.

In order to push back the  frontiers  of  poverty,  social  grants  will  be
increased by more than the inflation rate and tax cuts for  lower-to-middle-
income groups are on the cards. This will result  in  increased  consumption
and will stimulate the economy.

My mother in the rural village of Untunjambili phoned me on Friday and  told
me that since the ANC had taken over her life had not stopped improving.

Ngo-1994 wayehola impesheni  ka-R170  emuva  kwezinyanga  ezimbili.  Namuhla
uhola u-R570 ngenyanga. Uzizwele ngezakhe-ke  ukuthi  le  mali  izokhushulwa
ngenani elingaphezulu kokwehla  kwamandla  emali.  Usishayela  ihlombe  lesi
senzo,  ulindele  ngabomvu  ukuthi  uNgqongqoshe   weziMali   uzothini   uma
esememezela.

Ngokunjalo  nodadewethu  futhi  ohlala  endlini  yomxhaso  kaHulumeni   uthi
akanakulinda uchatha  lo  azowuthola  emalini  yokondla  abantwana,  i-child
support  grant,  kanti-ke  naye  ubesababaza  ukuthi  wake  wezwaphi  ukuthi
uHulumeni angakwakhela indlu njengenduku,  bhusende,  mahhala.  (Translation
of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[In 1994 she earned a pension of R170 after  two  months.  Today  she  earns
R570 per month. She heard  with  her  own  ears  that  this  money  will  be
increased at a higher  rate  than  that  of  inflation.  She  applauds  this
action, and she is waiting anxiously to hear what the  Minister  of  Finance
will say when he announces the news.

Accordingly, my sister, who stays in a state-funded  house,  says  she  will
not wait for the increase that she will get from the  child  support  grant.
She, too, was surprised that a government could build a house for  a  person
free of charge.]
My brother, who is a teacher in Nkandla, also cannot  wait  for  the  Budget
Speech, which is next week, to hear how much the tax cut  is  going  to  be,
because he maintains he gets two increments every year, one in the tax  cuts
and  the  other  which  is  negotiated   with   the   Public   Service   and
Administration. [Applause.]

In the spirit of Vuk'uzenzele we as  members  of  Parliament  are  going  to
ensure that, together with our communities, all  eligible  beneficiaries  of
these social grants are registered. Those of us who really come  from  these
previously  disadvantaged  communities  are  ourselves  beneficiaries  of  a
better life for all, and together with our communities will ensure that  the
year of the volunteer and reconstruction and  development  is  a  resounding
success.

The communities are responding very positively to  volunteerism,  regardless
of those that are calling for the opposite. [Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, Mr President, in a speech  in  Parliament  last
year the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk invited all South Africans to  come  to
the building site of the new South Africa and to help with the  building  of
a united and prosperous nation. He  called  on  South  Africans  to  play  a
constructive role in taking on the huge challenges  that  face  us  in  this
country and to break down all divides and suspicions.

Vandag is ons op hierdie bouperseel waar ons almal in vennootskap  ons  moue
moet oprol, en moet begin werk om aan al ons mense 'n beter lewe te  besorg.
Een van ons onmiddellike uitdagings in hierdie bouproses is om  armoede  uit
te wis. Ons uitdaging is om  suksesvolle  vennootskappe  te  vorm  binne  en
buite die politiek om hierdie uitdaging die hoof te bied.  Tydens  die  Nuwe
NP se armoedeberaad verlede maand het mnr Masere,  'n  voormalige  president
van Botswana, weer eens bevestig dat  sekere  grondbeginsels  in  plek  moet
wees om armoede te beveg.

In Suid-Afrika is ons besig om daardie basiese beginsels in plek te kry.  Om
op die lang termyn armoede en werkloosheid  op  te  los,  gaan  stabiele  en
volgehoue ekonomiese groei die belangrikste faktore wees. Dit is daarom  ook
een van die prioriteite in die ooreenkoms tussen die Nuwe  NP  en  die  ANC.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Today we are on this building site, where everybody should  roll  up  their
sleeves in partnership and start working to create a  better  life  for  all
our people. One of our immediate challenges in this process is to  alleviate
poverty. Our challenge is to form successful partnerships in as well as  out
of politics to win this challenge. Last month, during the New  NP's  poverty
summit, Mr Masere, a former president  of  Botswana,  confirmed  once  again
that certain basic principles  must  be  in  place  before  poverty  can  be
alleviated.

In South Africa we are putting those basic principles in place.  To  find  a
long-term solution  for  poverty  and  unemployment,  stable  and  sustained
economic growth will be the most important factors. That is  therefore  also
one of the priorities in the agreement between the New NP and the ANC.]

The New NP and the ANC share a  deep  commitment  to  tackling  poverty.  We
understand the burning desire of our people to restore their human  dignity,
and in our constituencies we share the pain of our  people,  who  day  after
day cannot find a job, who do not know whether they  will  still  own  their
homes a month from now or who can never be sure that they will  be  able  to
put food on the table. And that was one of  the  things  that  concerned  me
when we formed part of the DA. I never had the sense that the leadership  of
the DP shared with us the commitment to eradicate poverty, I never  got  the
sense that they had ever experienced poverty or that they really  understood
the problems and the emotions surrounding the issue.  And,  yes,  every  now
and then, for media photo opportunities they would try to  spend  a  day  in
the life of a poor person.

But I could never escape the impression that this was  mere  spin-doctoring.
It very soon became clear that the DA slogan ``For all the  people''  should
have read ``For some of the people''. And even today in  the  Western  Cape,
where 80% of the voters are coloured  and  black,  the  DP  only  has  white
members in the Western Cape Parliament. [Interjections.]

When my former colleague Glenn Adams recently passed away,  the  DP  saw  it
fit to  replace  the  last  nonwhite  representative  in  the  Western  Cape
legislature with yet another  white  representative.  [Interjections.]  This
reminded me of what coloured people and I experienced in  the  Western  Cape
when the DP leadership had tried to force Peter Marais  out  of  its  party.
During that time, somebody appropriately compared it to  the  emotions  they
experienced during the removal  of  the  coloured  voters  from  the  common
voters' role.

One could not escape from gaining the impression that the DP would  in  fact
like to be an old all-white party. This is  being  reinforced  by  the  DP's
insistence on sticking to the``fight back'' style of opposition. Our  people
out  there  experience  it  as  being  antiblack,  destructive  and  not  as
something that comes from a party that puts South Africa first.

With its message of fear, the DP is leading  its  voters  into  a  political
wilderness. Last week, the DP distributed a pamphlet in which they  compared
the New NP leader to Joshua Nkomo. What a strange comparison! If I  look  at
the  South  African  situation  evolving,  it  is   rather   the   DP   and,
specifically, Tony Leon, who reminds me  of  the  Zimbabwean  example.  Tony
Leon is  the  Ian  Smith  of  South  Africa.  He  does  not  want  to  share
responsibility for improving delivery. He fuels fear amongst his voters.  He
exploits racial polarisation. In short, he has an  old  South  Africa  mind-
set. As the angry white voice of South  Africa,  the  DP's  leadership  just
seems to have no confidence in our future and they thrive on  pessimism  and
failure in the country.

In fact, their confidence in the future of their own party is now at such  a
low level that they even force the councillors to sign  commitments  to  the
party and its leader, stating that they will  not  leave  the  party  before
2005. [Interjections.] I have  not  experienced  such  arrogance  and  self-
righteousness from any leader of the party under which I  have  served.  The
DP leader's autocratic and abrasive style was one of the  major  sources  of
tension in the DA. I remember how embarrassed I felt in the DA caucus  every
time the leader interrupted or attacked  caucus  members,  showed  them  the
door, or bragged about how he was  busy  or  going  to  discipline  grown-up
politicians who differed  with  his  positions  of  style.  [Interjections.]
Whereas the New NP's message is a message of  hope,  the  DP's  is  that  of
fear. [Interjections.] I look forward to the  new  face  in  South  Africa's
politics where those who inflame fear ... [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point  of  order:  Is  the  hon  member
allowed to stand here and tell lies? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, will you proceed.

Mr J J DOWRY: Those who inflame fear will be exposed for what they are,  and
those who believe in the country will form new  partnerships  to  make  this
country work.

As we all return to the building site this year, we will work hard to  build
a national consensus founded on a true South African patriotism to  confront
the great challenges facing our country,  including  poverty,  unemployment,
homelessness, crime and HIV/Aids. And, in doing  this,  I  look  forward  to
improving the quality of  life  of  all  our  people,  and  to  freeing  the
potential of every South African so that we can  restore  human  dignity  in
our country.

An HON MEMBER: May I raise a point of order? Not now? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Not now. Order, hon members! Before I recognise  anybody
else, Mr Gibson, I wish to address you. Your question  was  unparliamentary,
because you made the accusation that a member was telling a lie.  Would  you
please withdraw that?

An HON MEMBER: Withdraw it unconditionally!

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I withdraw the word ``lie''.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,
Deputy President and hon members, our President has paid  tribute  to  those
who led the negotiation  process  and  to  the  masses  of  our  people  who
ultimately are the true midwives of democracy.  It  is  those  same  groups,
whom  we  all  represent  here,  that  must  answer  the  President's  call,
Vuk'uzenzele, to build our nonracist and nonsexist democracy.

Despite the whingeing  of  the  chattering  strata,  we  have  made  massive
achievements in  the  struggle  against  racism,  sexism  and  poverty.  Our
country is a triumph. We are held up as a model for the world. They come  to
our country from Ireland, Israel and Palestine for inspiration.

Ten years ago the doomsayers predicted a race war. Through participation  in
our  democratic  process,  every  member  in  this  House,  no  matter   the
discordant chatter of some, stood up and solved the problem for  the  common
good. We are a triumph.

We wrote the most progressive Constitution and Bill of Rights on  earth.  We
formed this Parliament as a free and fair expression  of  the  will  of  the
people. We held successful elections for new local  government  as  well  as
our second national election. Power passed without pain from  one  President
to another.

Every party in this House agrees that South Africa is a  successful  working
constitutional democracy, and the hon Tony Leon's sour  assertion  that  the
ANC is bent on the obsessive accumulation of power is  contradicted  by  his
own presence here, although his fading support  suggests  that  increasingly
mature South  Africans  are  growing  weary  of  the  sour-faced  whingeing.
[Interjections.]

As for the hon P F Smith's bizarre assertions that  debate  here  serves  no
purpose, one wonders why on earth he has bothered  to  debate  at  all.  Our
traditional leaders are accorded respect and dignity. For  his  information,
a Cabinet committee  consisting  of  none  other  than  Ministers  Mufamadi,
Maduna, Ngubane and Matthews, has been drafting a Bill which  will  soon  be
put before this House. The  traditional  leaders,  having  been  briefed  at
their December national meeting, are keenly looking forward to this Bill.  I
do not know on what planet the hon member lives, because we are a triumph.

We were told that black people could not run  a  modern  economy,  and  that
they would bring financial ruin. Well, our  microeconomic  fundamentals  are
held up as a model of a developing economy, the foundation  on  which  jobs,
growth and sustainable development will most surely be built.

There has been steady deracialisation  of  all  sectors  of  society.  Where
before there were only white men, there are now learned, accomplished  black
women and men. Amongst them is a former Bantustan general, in  an  attempted
visual gag yesterday produced his hourglass, a good anachronistic symbol  of
his party.

There are now black women  to  be  found  everywhere:  Cabinet,  Parliament,
Government departments and the top offices of  corporations.  But  we  agree
with others in this debate -  Minister  Buthelezi  and  others  -  that,  of
course, we are not at the  journey's  end.  One's  colour  and  sex  at  the
instant of birth are still the general indicators of  whether  one  will  be
rich, educated and powerful. The President calls on all  South  Africans  to
eliminate racism, sexism and poverty, which is why the  doubting  Tonys  and
the hon  Seremanes  should  take  note  of  hon  Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk's
reference to providing hope rather than  hopelessness,  and  his  insightful
point that had whites shown a more  positive  attitude  in  Zimbabwe,  there
would be less strife there now.

I congratulate him and the  hon  Dowry  on  their  positive  approach.  They
understand that we must take heed. There are  two  worlds  in  our  country.
There are some who believe that corrective action has gone too  far,  while,
on the other hand, there are many who believe that  affirmative  action  has
been slow, that the formerly  privileged  contrive  to  hang  onto  economic
power and privilege. Social equity and justice require that remedial  action
is desirable, and will benefit all in the long run.

The hon Dr Mulder is concerned about geographic name changes, and  with  him
the hon Cassie Aucamp. The Afrikaner people show themselves to be  patriotic
to South Africa  and  amongst  the  white  communities,  few  of  them  have
``packed for Perth''. But what about the indigenous African names wiped  out
by colonial conquest? Are these to be eternally discarded? We need  to  work
together and I would like to say to the hon Mulder that, yes -  we  need  to
do so sensitively to help our diverse communities  to  understand  the  need
and together celebrate changes such as the Limpopo province  and  Polokwane.
How many, after all, miss the name ``Hendrik Verwoerd  Dam''  with  the  old
flag.

As much as we have achieved, the Government and ANC do  not  claim  to  have
done all that must be done for the poorest of the poor. But the plan  is  in
place. We say  to  hon  Minister  Buthelezi,  a  thoughtful,  sensitive  man
concerned with eradicating poverty, that there is still much to be done.  We
accept constructive criticism. We have learnt with him  from  our  mistakes.
Rome was not built in a day.

The President emphasised the many concrete steps that  have  been  taken  to
speed up our effort. We are committed to ending poverty and we will  succeed
by pulling together. Millions were denied  the  education,  the  homes,  the
clean water, the electricity,  the  sanitation,  the  health  services,  the
access to land, the adequate pensions  and  grants  for  children,  and  the
schooling which this Government is now giving to millions and millions.  And
as the President has insisted, no child will be educated under a tree.

In the painful past, the services were determined by racial  preference  and
gender, as was security. Hon members must remember what we all did  together
to create a new national Defence Force and a new Police Service,  which  are
now the pride of this country. And those  who  participated,  like  the  hon
Douglas Gibson in the Defence Review, which unanimously  decided  that  this
national Defence Force  should  have  the  weapons  to  do  the  job  in  an
unpredictable world, should be ashamed of their backtracking,  the  way  the
hon Tertius Delport did yesterday. [Interjections.]

The transformation of the police, I would like to say to the  Minister,  has
been  astonishing.  They  have  shown  increasing   mastery   of   difficult
situations. The explosion of bombs in Cape Town have  stopped.  The  bombers
are, largely, in jail.  Every  party  in  this  House  contributed  to  this
transformed South Africa, and we should be proud and we  should  not  whinge
and whine. Yes, crime is a major problem,  but  it  is  surmountable  and  I
would like to say to  Minister  Tshwete  and  the  President,  the  tide  is
turning.

Finally, I would like to comment  on  the  HIV/Aids  controversy,  which  is
raised by the chattering classes as though this is an  uncaring  Government.
The contrary is the  case.  [Interjections.]  Our  Government  -  those  hon
members must listen with their ears  and  not  their  mouths  -  has  always
asserted that improving the health of our people can only be done through  a
comprehensive, multisectoral approach that  is  not  premised  on  a  single
disease model, such as buying antiretrovirals for Aids. [Interjections.]  We
are not excluding that. It is not the silver  bullet.  [Interjections.]  Hon
members must listen.

This is because good health  relies  on  determinants  social,  behavioural,
economic and bio-medical. Therefore, to prevent and cure  disease,  requires
intervention in every one of  these  determinants,  the  most  important  of
which is poverty. This is what our President  and  our  Minister  of  Health
have been emphasising.

The second and third determinants  of  ill  health  are  undernutrition  and
water sanitation. These two go together. Determinants of  ill  health,  such
as the use of contaminated water, act directly to cause disease by  carrying
microbes  such  as  the  vibio  cholera  and  indirectly  causing   repeated
infections that weaken the immune system, exacerbating  conditions  such  as
Aids.

To combat Aids, therefore, a multisectoral approach is  needed,  which  does
not simply  concentrate  on  supplying  anti-retrovirals  that  are  neither
preventative nor curative. People on my  left  do  not  want  to  understand
this. They are claimed to extend life but we  do  not  know  what  they  are
doing about the quality of that extended life. Our learned friends  here  on
my left do not want to understand.

We  need  to  take  action  in  respect  of  the  determinants   of   immune
deficiencies  such  as  clean   water,   sanitation,   housing,   education,
unemployment and so on, which is exactly what this Government is all  about.
Not only is the multi-sectoral approach likely to be the most effective,  it
is also the most sustainable in developing countries such as  South  Africa,
where we live, that have limited resources.  The  approach  has  the  useful
effect of aiding economic development rather than simply depleting the  drug
budget. It  overlaps  with  the  Government's  comprehensive  multi-sectoral
programme against Aids and all other diseases.

I want to congratulate  the  President  on  his  up  to  date,  businesslike
address to our Parliament. We will respond to his call. We are proud  to  be
South African. Come on board! [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, hon President  and
hon Deputy  President,  colleagues,  comrades,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the
President's call, in his state of the nation address,  was  that  all  South
Africans had to ask themselves what they could do  for  themselves.  In  the
spirit of Vuk'uzenzele, we also need to look at black  economic  empowerment
and affirmative action and posit it within the broader  development  of  all
South Africans.

Black economic empowerment and affirmative action must not be seen as  anti-
white but, rather, as pro-South African. At a funeral of an honoured son  of
the South African soil, the late Marinus  Dalling,  the  President  recalled
the words of  Mr  Dalling  that  perhaps  the  time  has  come  to  look  at
empowering all South Africans, both black and white.
Having said that, black economic empowerment needs to be  the  objective  of
us all only to the extent that in order to redress  the  inequities  of  the
past, we try to accept and contribute to the  upliftment  and  levelling  of
the playing fields. But, we should do this only to the  extent  that  we  do
not also antagonise and drive away that hand of support and friendship  that
is being extended by the likes of the hon Marthinus van  Schalkwyk  and  his
party. In his absence, the hon Van Schalkwyk is a true South African  and  a
core builder of this wonderful country, which has potential, and  which  the
world recognises as a  haven  of  peace  and  safety  for  so  many  of  the
country's citizens. To him and his party,  black  economic  empowerment  and
affirmative action is to say: join us in our  endeavour  to  achieve  equity
whilst we adopt as our own your constituency, and together we walk the  road
to a future, undivided, united, black and white.

Ons gaan saamloop. Ons gaan hande vashou. [We are going  to  walk  together.
We are going to join hands.] Sizobambana. [We will sustain one another.]

Together we can do it. Black economic empowerment is not about  opportunism,
it is about Vuk'uzenzele. It is not about a  free  right  for  some  at  the
expense of others, but it is about ensuring that those who  are  willing  to
stand and act right are being fast-tracked because of the  past  disparities
in attaining equity in South Africa's economic life.

We all acknowledge and accept that the situation of  uneven  development  in
our country is as a result of deliberate policies of  the  past  which  were
planned and executed purposefully by  a  regime  with  clear  objectives  of
subjugation and discrimination.

This Government cannot, therefore, in the face of  this  reality,  stand  by
idly and hope that redress will come on the wings  of  inevitability.  There
has to be a clearly targeted  programme  to  reverse  the  effects  of  past
practices. Maybe it is worthy to note and  acknowledge  the  black  economic
empowerment pioneers in Government, and that is the Department  of  Minerals
and Energy, which is already implementing  the  transformation  strategy  in
mining and in the liquid fuels industry. They have developed  guidelines  on
black economic empowerment. They  have  a  charter  focusing  on  issues  of
ownership, management, control, access  to  affordable  finance,  employment
equity,  skills  development,  affirmative  procurement,  co-operatives  and
others. I think that their experiences will provide lessons to all of us  as
we work on the black economic empowerment policy framework.

Black  economic  empowerment  is  also   about   focusing   on   the   worst
disadvantaged sector of our population, which is  women.  We  all  know  the
process of development in South Africa has  generally  marginalised  us  and
deprived us of the opportunity to participate in  the  economic  mainstream,
and unless and until  we  all  buy  into  the  programme  of  Government  of
ensuring that women begin to take their rightful place in the South  African
economic life, our country will remain a poor, miserable and hopeless  place
for most of its citizens.

I do not want to stoop to the level of debates preferred  here  by  the  hon
Bantu Holomisa. I do not believe that this is the kind of discourse that  we
as proud South Africans would want to engage in. It is  too  reminiscent  of
the Bantustan politics.

Whilst I will not claim any particular or preferential expertise, I  am  the
Deputy Minister of  Trade  and  Industry  and  I  somehow  think  that  that
qualifies me to support the Minister of  Safety  and  Security's  contention
that this hon member is indeed a factory fault. [Laughter.]

We must make no mistake about this Government's commitment  to  the  genuine
and laudable ideals of transformation and fairness. Empowerment goes to  the
heart of the debate about the fundamental task of  transformation.  We  will
do it with legislation if necessary, but we would  prefer  co-operation  and
consensus. Whatever route we take, it is for us to  ensure  that  we  do  it
together but, if necessary, to isolate and exclude the prophets of doom  and
the purveyors of untruths, discordant notes, retrogression,  bitterness  and
losers. I am talking to the opposition party.

In conclusion, I would like to say that  the  President's  leadership  needs
our support, not, as these small opposition would lead us believe, to  focus
on one or two weaknesses, but support for  the  overall  quiet  success  and
growth of the country has achieved, and still is  achieving  and  which  the
whole world sees and acknowledges, but which somehow  eludes  the  so-called
more knowledgeable in our country.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I am of the view that God wants our  nation  to
succeed. Through His  grace  He  has  given  us  a  peaceful  transition.  I
remember the time when the EPG visited South  Africa  before  the  elections
and they gave us no hope for our country, saying they did not  believe  that
there would be a peaceful transition, yet I think in history  books  now  we
stand as a nation saluted by the nations of the world for the example  which
we have set.

In order for our nation to succeed we must pray  for  the  success  of  this
Government. Good  government  is  God's  idea  not  man's  idea.  Any  human
government will have its strengths and weaknesses and the President  in  his
opening address to Parliament has brought our attention to the successes  of
this Government, when he said that ``65% of the promises  made  have  either
been  achieved  or  accreditably  in  progress''.  The  ACDP  commends   the
President and the  Government  for  the  progress  made  in  all  the  areas
mentioned in the opening address.

There is truth in the statement: ``The struggle  to  eradicate  poverty  and
underdevelopment in our country is fundamental to  the  achievement  of  our
own national goal to build a caring  and  people-centred  society''.  But  I
believe that wealth and development are not the only elements needed  for  a
caring society. There must be something more  than  wealth  and  development
that will cause us to be a caring people. There  are  many  Western  nations
that are wealthy and well developed, yet they  are  not  necessarily  caring
societies.

In addition to the eradication of poverty and the promotion of  development,
we must also promote the spiritual and moral  values  which  has  stood  the
test of time. Allow me to list a spiritual verse which in my view will  make
of us a better and caring society. The  first  one  is  a  concern  for  the
common good of others above our own self-interest. Every day we  read  about
the acts of crime in our nation and often the poorest of the  poor  are  the
victims of crime.

The Government plays an important role in fighting crime. The  promotion  of
law and order is perhaps the most important function, but  Government  alone
cannot stand the tidal wave of lawlessness and crime. Every MP,  family  and
community must voluntarily contribute to the fight against crime.  Secondly,
in order to accelerate development we must promote a strong work  ethic  and
become more productive. It is not  the  function  of  government  to  create
jobs.  However,  the  Government  plays  a  leading  role  in  creating  the
conditions to encourage economic development.

We also learnt from the President's speech  that  1,2  million  houses  have
been built or are under construction, and this is a great  achievement.  The
next challenge, especially for the  local  Government,  is  to  ensure  that
houses become homes by improving the access to basic services.

In conclusion, I believe that we can become a more  caring  nation,  but  we
will only succeed in that if we promote and implement the eternal norms  and
values which have been given to us as a nation by God Himself.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Madam Speaker, in his speech on  Friday,  the  President
said:


  We are progressing towards the achievement of the historic  goal  of  the
  eradication  of  a  centuries-old  legacy  of  colonialism,  racism   and
  apartheid.

He also made reference to our diverse heritage  and  the  need  to  build  a
common identity and  nationhood.  The  equal  development  of  cultures  and
languages in South Africa is an  area  that  is  as  challenging  as  it  is
sensitive and sometimes emotive. The Freedom Charter clearly declares:


  All people shall have the equal right to use their own languages, and  to
  develop their own folk culture and customs. All national groups shall  be
  protected by law against insults to their race and national prideÿ.ÿ.ÿ.

The Bill of Rights gives every citizen the right, and I quote:


  ... to use the language and to participate in the cultural life of  their
  choice.

Our society consists of a rich tapestry of cultures and languages.  However,
the reality is that the majority of  our  people  have  been  made  to  feel
ashamed of their way of life, their music, their  traditions  and  even  the
way they look - in a nutshell, who they are.

The good thing is that we acknowledge where we come from in the preamble  to
the Constitution, in which we say we must be united in our  diversity.  This
gives us all the choice to decide where we wish to place ourselves  in  this
tapestry, both as individuals and as communities or groups.  It  commits  us
to doing everything possible to free the potential of each  person  for  the
ultimate good of the nation we are building. In order for  that  to  happen,
every South African must feel  positive  about  their  identity.  They  must
derive pride and dignity from the status accorded to what was left  to  them
by their ancestors.

A lot of work has been and continues  to  be  done,  in  spite  of  problems
relating to lack of  capacity  and  resources.  The  executive,  independent
institutions and Parliament have played some roles at  different  levels  in
this regard. To give effect to aspects of  our  vision,  various  pieces  of
legislation have been passed. Some of them are the following. The  Pan-South
African Language Board Act provides for the recognition, implementation  and
furtherance of multilingualism in the  Republic  of  South  Africa  and  the
development of previously marginalised languages. The National Arts  Council
Act represents South Africa's  first  democratically  formulated  policy  on
arts, culture and heritage. The Cultural Institutions Act provides  for  the
restructuring of the current, declared institutions  and  helps  to  rectify
aspects of South African history that have been neglected.
Then there is the draft Bill currently before Parliament on  the  Commission
for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of  Cultural,  Religious  and
Linguistic  Communities.  This  Bill  was  drafted  after  a   comprehensive
consultative process which included political debates in Parliament  in  the
provincial legislatures, public hearings in the  provinces,  submissions  to
Government and a number of national consultative conferences.

The draft language policy and plan  for  South  Africa,  the  product  of  a
protracted consultative process with Government departments,  civil  society
and other role-players, is currently being  finalised.  It  provides  for  a
regulatory framework for the effective management of  the  use  of  official
languages,  to  support  economic  development  through  the  promotion   of
multilingualism. We must commend PanSALB for some of  the  strides  made  in
the field of language development and their vision of raising  awareness  of
multilingualism as a resource  to  foster  pride  in  and  respect  for  all
languages.

Recent research into language use, conducted  by  PanSALB,  contradicts  the
myth that African parents favour their children being schooled  in  English.
Only  12%  of  people  interviewed  preferred  English  as  the  medium   of
instruction, whereas 42% thought learners should  have  the  opportunity  to
learn  both  their  mother  tongue  and  English   equally   well.   Another
significant finding is that only  22%  of  non-English-speaking  respondents
fully  comprehend  speeches  and  statements  made  in  English,  with   49%
struggling  to  understand  English.  IsiZulu,  on  the   other   hand,   is
understood, by about 70% of South Africans. The  phasing  out  of  Tshivenda
and Sesotho at Thembisa High School because of  administrative  difficulties
attracted an angry response  from  the  parents  of  the  Tshivenda-speaking
children.

Esikushoyo  ukuthi  njengesizwe  kufanele  senze  konke  okusemandleni  ethu
ukuthi amasiko ethu nezilimi zethu zithole ukuthuthukiswa ngokugcwele.

Siphuma   esikhathini   lapho   isiNgisi   nesiBhunu   bekuyizona    izilimi
ezisetshenziswayo ngokomthetho wezwe. Yonke into  ebhalwa  ngumbuso  ibhalwa
ngesiNgisi  nesiBhunu.  Izimali   zithelwa   ekuthuthukiseni   lezi   zilimi
nasekuthuthukiseni  amasiko  nezimpilo  zamaNgisi  namaBhunu.  Sithi-ke   lo
mzansi esikuwo awusafani nalowo. Sesihamba ngolunye unyawo manje.

Sonke  sinamalungelo  okuba  siziqhenye  ngobuthina  bethu   nangezimfundiso
zawobabamkhulu bethu. Kufuneka futhi  sikhulise  abantwana  bethu  ngendlela
ezokwenza ukuba nabo babamukele ubuntu babo. Umbuso wethu uzama ngazo  zonke
izindlela  ukuba   ukhuthaze   abantu   bakithi   ukuthi   sonke,   ikakhulu
osomabhizinisi,  sibambe  iqhaza  ekuthuthukiseni  amasiko  akhayo  nezilimi
zawokhokho bethu. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[What we are saying is that as a nation  we  should  do  everything  in  our
power to ensure that our cultures and languages are fully developed.

We come from an era in  which  only  English  and  Afrikaans  were  official
languages. Everything that the state wrote was  in  Afrikaans  and  English.
Money was poured into developing these languages, cultures and the lives  of
English and Afrikaans people. Now we say the present South Africa is  unlike
the old one. We have changed now.

We all have a right to be proud of what we are and about  the  tradition  of
our forefathers. We should bring up our children in a  way  that  will  make
them accept their humanity.  Our  Government  is  trying  by  all  means  to
encourage our people, that is  all  of  us,  especially  businesspeople,  to
participate in developing some aspects of our  cultures  that  will  improve
our lives, and also the languages of our forefathers.]

The publishing industry is an important indicator of our  development  as  a
nation. One of the exciting new opportunities is the publication of  African
children's books. The  development  of  a  reading  culture,  expanding  the
reading market, and the promotion of better access by our ordinary  citizens
to public libraries are still challenges. In this regard  Microsoft's  offer
to make software available to schools will go a long way towards helping  to
address some of these challenges, provided our  schools  are  equipped  with
computers.

Through the Khoisan poverty alleviation project, the Khoisan community  will
be able to start marketing their arts and crafts  on  a  better  scale  than
before. It has  been  agreed  that  the  Khoisan  legacy  project,  launched
through the SA  Heritage  Agency,  would  be  best  celebrated  through  the
establishment of a national Khoisan heritage route.  The  spin-offs  include
the development of cultural tourism and provision of jobs and  opportunities
in rural areas.
We still have a lot to do in  respect  of  training  a  critical  number  of
translators and interpreters.  Parliament  itself  continues  to  experience
difficulties related to this matter. The  lack  of  capacity  in  Government
departments affects our legislative work relating to the need for  Bills  to
be  translated  into  at  least  one  other  official  language.  We   often
experience delays caused by  having  to  wait  for  translations.  Secondly,
members of Parliament who do not  speak  English  and  Afrikaans  are  still
required to apply for  translation  and  interpretation  services  24  hours
before mailing their speeches, because  Parliament  itself  still  does  not
have adequate capacity to provide these services at short notice.

Other challenges I would like to touch on are, firstly, that  arts,  culture
and heritage should be better subsidised and maintained,  and  the  business
sector must play a bigger role in this respect.  Secondly,  South  Africans,
particularly young South Africans, need to  develop  a  plan  of  action  to
ensure their cultural survival. We see around us our children becoming  more
and more Americanised.  Thirdly,  South  Africans  must  protect  themselves
against a worldwide tendency to obliterate the cultural identity of  various
peoples in favour of a subtly imposed culture  that  does  not  promote  the
values  of  equality,  dignity,  mutual  respect  and  recognition  of   all
cultures. This we must do by promoting especially the previously  suppressed
cultures.

In conclusion, I believe that this society has a  long  way  to  go  towards
eradicating the legacy of inequality. We need  to  continue  to  talk  about
what we are doing or not doing right. We need to be honest where there is  a
lack of progress in the equal development of culture and  language  so  that
we can take the necessary steps forward. Let us always  try  to  strike  the
balance necessitated by the reality within which we have to operate and  the
ideal situation we want to see in place.

With the little time I still have,  I  want  to  remind  us  of  yesterday's
appropriate intervention by Ubaba, Umtwana uMangosuthu  Buthelezi,  when  he
pointed out inappropriate behaviour by the  hon  Leader  of  the  Opposition
who, in his view, was talking down to  members  of  the  House.  I  want  to
suggest that perhaps the hon Smith needs to be told just a little bit  about
old-fashioned Zulu manners. [Applause.]

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Mev die Speaker, ek dink, voordat die  Nuwe  NP  ons  weer
kom vertel wat hulle vir die armes gaan doen, moet hulle vir  hierdie  mense
wat in die Huis nog vir hulleself kan dink, vertel wat hulle aan  die  armes
gedoen het in die meer as 40 jaar wat hulle aan die bewind was. [Applous.]

Mnr Nelson Mandela het sy Rivoniabetoog en  sy  toespraak  die  dag  met  sy
vrylating afgesluit met die woorde: ``Vir hierdie ideale wil ek  lewe,  maar
as dit nodig is, is ek bereid om daarvoor  te  sterwe!''  Die  President  se
oproep tot morele herlewing is lofwaardig, maar dit kan net slaag as  elkeen
van ons, sonder om 'n kompromis aan te gaan, eerbare  waardes  en  beginsels
met ons lewens verdedig.

Mense wat kan dink - en  ek  verneem  dis  een  van  die  redes  waarom  mev
Madikizela-Mandela nie dikwels by die Parlement opdaag  nie,  want  sy  word
nie toegelaat om vir haarself te dink  nie  -  het  bitter  min  respek  vir
iemand wie se beginsels te ruil is vir kontant.

Die leier van die Nuwe NP en Kobus Dowry weet  die  Marais-saga  het  gegaan
oor meer as net name. Marais het belowe om die mening van Kaapstad se  mense
te  toets.  Die  een  dag  het   Marais   nog   ver   agtergeloop   in   die
meningspeilings; die volgende dag het hy ver voorgeloop, op 'n  wyse  waarop
hy die eerbaarheid van die proses geskend het. Mnr Van Schalkwyk beroep  hom
nou slegs op 'n hofuitspraak. Daar is honderde moordenaars  wat  daar  buite
rondloop nadat hulle  op  tegniese  punte  deur  howe  vrygespreek  is.  Vir
moraliteit is meer as hofuitsprake nodig. Dit vra vir 'n gewete  waarmee  jy
voor mense en voor God moet saamleef. Die agb Dowry  praat  van  bruinmense.
Die  bruinmense  met  wie  ek  gepraat  het,  van  Kamieskroon  tot  in  die
Richtersveld, van Laingsburg tot  in  Murraysburg,  sê  hulle  kan  mnr  Van
Schalkwyk nie meer vertrou nie, want sy aand- en  sy  môrepraatjies  is  nie
dieselfde nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speaker, I think that before the  New  NP  come  and
tell us again what they are going to do for the poor they should tell  those
people in the House who can still think for themselves what they did to  the
poor in the more than 40 years that they were in power. [Applause.]

Mr Nelson Mandela ended his Rivonia speech and his  speech  on  his  release
from prison with the words: ``It is an ideal which I hope to live  for,  but
if needs be, it  is  an  ideal  for  which  I  am  prepared  to  die''.  The
President's call for moral renewal is praiseworthy, but it can only  succeed
if every single one of us defends honourable values and principles with  our
lives, without compromising.

People who are able to think - and I hear that is one  of  the  reasons  why
Mrs Madikizela-Mandela does not often come to  Parliament,  because  she  is
not allowed to think for herself - have  very  little  respect  for  someone
whose principles can be exchanged for cash.

The leader of the New NP and Kobus Dowry  know  that  the  Marais  saga  was
about more than just names. Marais promised  to  test  the  opinion  of  the
people of Cape Town. One day Marais was still  far  behind  in  the  opinion
polls; the next day he was far ahead, in a way  in  which  he  violated  the
integrity of the  process.  Mr  Van  Schalkwyk  now  only  invokes  a  court
decision. There are hundreds of murderers  walking  about  after  they  have
been acquitted by courts on technical points. More than court  decisions  is
necessary for morality. It requires a conscience with  which  one  can  live
before people and before God. The hon  Dowry  speaks  about  coloureds.  The
coloureds I have talked to,  from  Kamieskroon  to  the  Richtersveld,  from
Laingsburg to Murraysburg, said  that  they  can  no  longer  trust  Mr  Van
Schalkwyk, because his word cannot be trusted.]
The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, would you please take a seat.

Mnr J J DOWRY: Mev die Speaker, ek wil graag weet of die agb  lid  'n  vraag
sal beantwoord?

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Mev die Speaker, nee, ek sal nie 'n vraag beantwoord nie.

Dis 'n verskriklike aantyging; dis 'n duur prys  om  te  betaal  net  om  'n
bywoner-skoothondjie  te  word.   (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, I would like to know whether  the  hon  member
will answer a question.

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speaker, no, I will not answer a question.

It is a terrible accusation; it is a high price to  pay  just  to  become  a
participant lapdog.]

On many occasions over the past years the President and his party have  been
weighed and found wanting. I will stick to four examples.

A prominent member of  the  ANC  was  struck  off  the  roll  of  practising
attorneys  by  the  Pietermariztburg  High  Court   in   1998   because   of
``unauthorised withdrawals'' - what a fine description! - in excess of  R500
000 from trust funds. To assist her, she was given an interest-free loan  of
R232 000 by the ANC. This, while ordinary members of the  ANC,  the  masses,
the poorest of the poor, must turn to loan  sharks  for  financial  support.
[Interjections.] Apart from that, she was hired by an ANC council,  probably
on instruction from somewhere, for R112 000 per  month,  which  was  R82 600
per month more expensive than the lowest bidder.

The former director-general of Home Affairs, who left  under  a  cloud,  has
now been appointed as a very senior official in South  African  soccer.  The
ANC mayor of the Nelson Mandela metropole has been  declared  mayor  of  the
year in spite of his abuse of discretionary funds. The role  of  the  ethics
committee has been sabotaged because of the unwillingness of ANC members  to
stand up for what is right.

In al hierdie  gevalle  was  daar  geen  reaksie  of  repudiëring  deur  die
President of enige leier van die party nie. [In all  these  instances  there
was no reaction or repudiation  by  the  President  or  any  leader  of  the
party.]

Is the President serious and is his party serious about moral  regeneration?
Or is it true that there are only two qualifications needed  to  become  ANC
MP: Firstly, one must have the ability to press a button, and secondly,  one
must have the ability to shout ``blue!''. I do  not  fully  agree  with  the
notion, because with people like Andrew Feinstein and Pregs  Govender  there
must be some members who take their oversight role seriously. May I  repeat:
The call for a summit is fine, but unless all of us are willing to  practise
what we preach this will be an exercise in futility. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President  and  colleagues,  on  the
occasion of his inauguration on 16 June 1999, the President  said  that  our
democracy at that time was at the ... mahube a naka tsa kgomo  [early  hours
of the morning] ... stage, meaning that it was at dawn. Two years  and  some
months since then it should be at the ... di  tlwaela  mafulo  [just  before
noon] ... stage. This is the time at which herds roam freely in the  grazing
to indicate that they have been freed from the  confines  of  the  kraal  or
have shaken off the dew.

Surely the nation must by now have shaken off past ills  of  dependency  and
entitlement. People have to work hard and not sit back,  feeling  that  they
are owed something because of  who  they  are  or  what  they  did  for  the
liberation of the country. The time has come for our people to  accept  that
they should arise and act.

Kuyafuneka ukuthi abantu bavuke bazenzele izinto okufuneka zenziwe.  [It  is
important that people should wake up and do  the  things  that  need  to  be
done.]

My party has always shown that volunteerism has no equal in  developing  the
nation. We have imbued our people with the dictum: Re na le  rona.  [We  are
together.] If we rely on ourselves we shall prosper. We in the UCDP  welcome
strides made in providing  potable  water  to  some  7  million  people  and
providing electricity grid connections to  some  3  million  households.  We
also welcome the envisaged substantial increases  in  old-age  pensions  and
social grants.
However, great resolve and determination have to be shown by  Government  on
the question of resolving the impasse  between  Government  and  traditional
leaders regarding their role and powers. The continued delay  in  addressing
the matter has a debilitating effect on the  traditional  leaders.  We  hope
that, if need be, the Constitution will be amended to factor in  the  powers
of amakhosi, as the President himself said in his address in the NCOP on  12
October 2000. To us the acceptance, recognition and empowerment of  amakhosi
is  about  respect  and  being  African  in  the  quest  for   the   African
Renaissance.

The eradication of poverty  will  be  welcomed  by  all  well-meaning  South
Africans. We hope that  in  attempting  to  improve  the  quality  of  life,
Government will give a thought to the apparently forsaken  communities  such
as those in Tshepisong, west of Roodepoort. This  urban  community  has  the
characteristic incommodious, poor-quality houses that are the  trademark  of
houses being built for blacks since  1994.  The  area  has  no  schools  and
children have to trudge  long  distances  to  and  from  school  in  distant
Krugersdorp and Dobsonville. With unemployment rife in the  area,  and  with
no public transport and the obvious high rate  of  crime  these  days,  such
children are vulnerable to abuse. We appeal  to  the  Government  to  ensure
that integrated development planning takes place. As residential  areas  are
being built, schools should also spring up simultaneously. The situation  of
residential areas being put up without any schools is also prevalent in  the
Ga-Rankuwa and Mabopane areas. Surely this matter has to be addressed.

Jobless young people are waiting on the fringes, with  some  hope  that  the
Umsobomvu fund will come to their aid. The  question  is:  How  long  should
they wait? The chief executive officer of the fund is on  record  as  saying
that he is  aiming  at  funding  people  who  wish  to  train  as  chartered
accountants, that is improving  the  qualifications  of  a  few  while  more
remain unqualified and unemployed. We hope, in the  words  of  the  hon  the
President, that ``the fund will be spent with  the  efficiency  demanded  by
the actual needs of society''.

We  welcome  the  planned  moral  regeneration  summit  and  hope  that  all
interested folk will be brought on board in  good  time  so  that  they  can
contribute meaningfully, and not be tuned in to passive listeners. There  is
still hope that the decaying moral fibre  of  our  society  can  be  mended.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]
Mr R K SEPTEMBER: Madam Speaker, hon  President,  in  August/September  this
year people of the world will honour our country and gather in  Johannesburg
to attend the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We will  need  to  be
do everything possible to welcome our international guests,  who  expect  to
be in excess of 50 000 people. It is important that as many  of  our  people
as possible are requested to volunteer their services  to  ensure  that  the
summit succeeds. We are faced with the task of alerting our people  of  what
to  expect.  The  organisation  is  obviously  vast  and  complex,  and  our
responsibilities will be enormous.

Our country's progress in sustainable development could  not  have  advanced
so much without foreign partnerships, which have enabled  us  to  engage  in
various projects. The New Partnership for African  Development  acknowledges
the desire and the need to eradicate poverty and concentrate on  growth  and
development. It recognises the interdependence on our continent.

We have  signed  the  Basel  Convention  on  the  Control  of  Transboundary
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. In collaboration with  the
international community, we have paid serious attention to the  problems  of
desertification. We have paid attention to the problems of illegal trade  in
flora and fauna; the problems of wetlands and of the ozone  layer;  and  the
conservation of migratory animals, to quote but a few of many issues.

Critics have often seen fit to criticise our President for his trips  abroad
without  understanding  the   sterling   role   he   plays   in   developing
international  relations,  especially  with  our  African  neighbours.   Our
organisation has a very clear vision of our  international  responsibilities
arising from a great deal of experience. We can lift our  heads  with  pride
when we consider the respect our country has achieved as  a  result  of  the
role of our hon President and our emissaries. A person must be either  mean-
spirited or naive not to acknowledge our  President's  international  status
and successes.

The appeal of our hon President for volunteers is no empty catch phrase.  It
is based on the memory of the effectiveness of communities during  the  dark
days of apartheid. Simply put, we need to recognise that  on  its  own,  the
Government just cannot achieve what is necessary for harnessing  the  energy
and morale of our people. The NGO sector in our society has for long  played
a significant role in the struggle for change of  the  lot  of  our  people.
This role must be extended to embrace a much wider section of our society.

We are grappling  with  the  challenge  of  ensuring  that  our  society  is
transformed in a scientific, modern, and, of course, more equitable way.  We
now have a government which represents a population of more than 40  million
people, and is intent on bringing all our people on board.

The laws required to do this are systematically being put  in  place.  There
are a few examples to demonstrate this point. In dealing with the  challenge
of conducting a sustainable campaign against poverty, we have  developed  an
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development  Strategy  and  the  Urban  Renewal
Programme. South Africa is now co-operating with Germany  in  the  promotion
of solar cooking, and today about 70%  of  South  Africans  have  access  to
electricity.

Regarding  the  environment,  White  Papers  were  prepared  on   integrated
pollution and waste management. Our Government is now able to give  guidance
on hazardous waste management and pollutants.  A  White  Paper  is  also  in
place on conservation and  the  sustainable  use  of  biological  diversity.
There is the National Forestry Action Plan as  well  as  the  Marine  Living
Resources Act.

Awareness of energy efficiency is  being  planned  as  part  of  the  school
curriculum. Environmental law has been introduced into  tertiary  education,
and we must welcome this attention being paid to the education of our  young
people. They are the ones who will take the custodianship of  our  resources
into the future.

These are but a few snippets of what we are trying to do,  or  have  already
achieved in the arena of environmental development.  But  implementation  is
really the name of the game, and, in this regard,  we  must  recognise  that
whilst we have made significant progress in law on paper and whilst we  have
also made significant progress in practice, we still have a long,  long  way
to go.

Tourism has tremendous potential as a tool for development  and  employment,
and marked progress has been made in this field. Yet,  we  have  encountered
almost total control of the industry by  old-order  entrepreneurs.  Clearly,
much needs to be done in order to enable black participants  to  be  engaged
in this field. This is not easy, when faced by the  old  schooltie  brigade.
One can ask any sportsman about this.

We face similar challenges in the fishing  industry.  Once  almost  entirely
handled by people of colour, those with greater resources  now  control  the
industry. The right  of  poor  people  to  earn  a  decent  living  must  be
recognised. Indeed, nowhere is the need for personal responsibility and  the
spirit of volunteerism more necessary than in this industry. Eventually,  we
are all called upon to protect our reserves of kreef,  perlemoen  and  fish.
They cannot just be left to the policemen. [Interjections.]

On another front, there is something wrong when our resources are  spent  on
building islands  for  privileged  suburban  roads  in  privileged  suburbs,
while, at the same time, the provision of basic road services in poor  black
townships  just  four  miles  away  is   being   totally   neglected.   Such
unwillingness to embrace the spirit  of  transformation  on  the  ground  is
demoralising to those whom we need as participants in building  our  nation.
This is happening right here in Cape Town. One cannot justify closure  of  a
waterfront slipway to subsistence fishers, a facility which  has  been  used
by them for generations, only to make way for an  upmarket  development.  We
have surely had enough of that. There are enough scars  on  the  skyline  of
the city which bear testimony to the way  in  which  our  people  have  been
dispossessed  in  the  past.  [Interjections.]  Is  it  too  much   to   ask
councillors to volunteer goodwill and to  ensure  that  more  resources  are
used to build facilities in the poorer areas?

It should be clear to us that our legal transformation needs to  be  secured
by the participation of our whole population. Let  us  move  away  from  the
culture of dependency on the hierarchy, waiting for the  councillor,  an  MP
or an MPL. We must not wait for Godot, nor must we allow the intentions  and
efforts of good men and women to be subverted  by  those  who  misuse  their
position of power. Let us, the whole population, do what  is  necessary  for
the sustainable development of our environment. [Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, the president of  a  country  is  elected  to
serve the best interests of the people. To the man in the  street  it  means
putting in place policies that will allow people to live the  longest,  most
productive lives possible.

The simple truth is that President Mbeki's  stand  on  Aids  has  fairly  or
unfairly earned him the reputation of  a  modern-day  Lysenko.  He  was  the
Russian pseudo-scientist  whose  bizarre  ideas  on  crop  evolution  caused
thousands to die of famine. Hundreds of thousands of lives that  could  have
been saved or extended have been lost by the President's  dogged  denial  of
the fact that HIV causes Aids. Few presidents of countries not at  war  have
ever been responsible for such a monstrous legacy.  Government's  policy  on
providing antiretroviral therapy to HIV-positive pregnant mothers  and  rape
survivors denounces and violates the very human right that our  Constitution
serves and was designed to protect. It is Government's denial of  nevirapine
in particular that is actually fuelling the  so-called  illegal  importation
of the drug and causing doctors employed by the state to  make  a  conscious
choice between professional ethics and state policy. In fact, in  Mpumalanga
and the Northern Cape, doctors are victimised, harassed and  even  suspended
for providing life-saving drugs, just because it displeases  the  President.
[Interjections.]

The DA has been accused of politicising the Aids debate. The reality is  the
other way around. The DA has been vilified and  rejected  for  offering  its
hand in the so-called partnership against Aids. The President may  recall  a
75-page correspondence between himself and  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition
about a year ago. It is in this correspondence that the President  denounced
antiretroviral therapy as ineffective, as a post-exposure  prophylactic,  as
illogical for use, with no scientific basis whatsoever, and  felt  that  its
toxicity posed a danger to public health. This  very  medication  which  the
President labels as illegal and unethical is being advocated by the  JMC  on
the Quality  and  Status  of  Women  as  part  of  the  treatment  for  rape
survivors. The President appears to be the lone ranger  facing  revolt  from
within his party, in Parliament and  from  hospitals  and  clinics  in  this
epidemic. [Interjections.]

Hundreds of rape survivors at the Sunninghill Clinic are  testimony  to  the
internationally proven fact that not one person who was given ART within  72
hours after rape, sero-converted. Every responsible  leader  in  this  House
and even parliamentary committees are saying that we are at war with the HI-
virus and that both behavioural and medical interventions are  needed  as  a
matter of urgency.

The only leader in this House who did not mention HIV/Aids was the  hon  Van
Schalkwyk. Instead he chose to tiptoe around  this  critical  life-and-death
issue, simply to ingratiate himself with the ANC. It shows  to  what  depths
one would go for a Cabinet post. The DA  in  the  Western  Cape,  under  the
leadership of Tony  Leon,  has  rolled  out  81  HIV  treatment  sites.  The
Government, under the leadership of President Mbeki, has rolled out  a  mere
18 test sites countrywide. Perhaps  the  President  would  like  to  take  a
lesson from the DA and our monument to life, as opposed  to  the  legacy  of
death given to the 40 000 babies born positive last year. It costs 86  cents
per dose for a baby and R7,67 per  adult  dose  of  nevirapine.  Instead  of
wasting money on costly appeals, the President should put  his  money  where
his mouth is. Vuk'uzenzele! [Arise and act!]

Break the silence. Admit that the ANC has  erred  in  the  handling  of  the
HIV/Aids pandemic. The President's refusal to say that HIV  causes  Aids  is
nothing  short  of  criminal   and   the   cost   of   lives   incalculable.
[Interjections.] Instead of offering Band Aid therapy, the President  should
offer antiretroviral therapy to pregnant positive mothers and their babies.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: You are a fool, girl. Sit down!

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: There were other  members
too, but certainly the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Affairs
would probably claim to be honourable. He started with  his  animal  noises,
which I believe is not only unparliamentary, but  in  absolute  contempt  of
the Chair, given the fact that on a couple of occasions now, the  Chair  has
indicated very forcibly and again in relation to the particular member  from
the DP, that such behaviour is unbecoming and unparliamentary.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, were you making animal noises?

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker,  I  have
yet to know what an animal noise is. [Interjections.]

The  SPEAKER:  Order!  Hon  members,  this  is  a  serious  matter.  I  have
previously advised you that you are not to mimic any member of  this  House.
Please would you refrain and not do this in future. I will  take  a  serious
view. I was listening very, very carefully at the  beginning.  I  am  sorry.
Now it is obvious that if such noises are emanating  from  anywhere  in  the
House, I will have to be more vigilant.

Nk B O DLAMINI: Somlomo weNdlu yesishayamthetho,  Mongameli  ohloniphekileyo
waseNingizimu    Afrika,    Sekela    Mongameli,    namalungu    ePhalamende
ahloniphekile, kuyintokozo enkulu kithina malungu e-ANC  ukukhuluma  ngodaba
lokukhululeka kwabantu besifazane, ikakhulukazi ngoba le nhlangano yethu  i-
ANC   kade   yakubona   kubalulekile   ukubandakanya    abantu    besifazane
emzabalazweni wenkululeko yabantu baseNingizimu Afrika.

Abazange abantu besifazane baze babizwe noma bamenywe  noma  bacelwe  ukuthi
bazozibandakanya   emzabalazweni.   Yingoba   abantu   besifazane   babekade
beyingxenye  yemizabalazo  yabantu  ezindaweni  abahlala  kuzo,   ezakhiweni
zemishoshaphansi, kanti babeyingxenye yombutho  wabantu,  uMkhonto  Wesizwe.
Lokhu babekwenza ngokuzimisela okukhulu.

Kuyaqala ngqa emlandweni waseNingizimu  Afrika  ukuthi  kubhekelwe  izimfuno
zabantu besifazane ngale ndlela. Uma umuntu efuna  ukwazi  ukuthi  uHulumeni
uyenzile  yini  impilo  engcono  kubantu,   angabuza   kubantu   besifazane.
Bazophendula  labo  abaneqiniso.  Lokhu   kwenzeke   ngezindlela   eziningi.
Ukutholakala kwezinto ezibalulekile empilweni  yabantu  njengamanzi,  ugesi,
amaklinikhi, izindlu, izindlu zokufundela  kanye  nokutholakala  kwemihlaba,
zonke  lezi  zinto  yizona  ezenza  ukuthi  omame  babone  ukuthi  uHulumeni
uzimisele  ukuthi  bangenzi  imisebenzi   engenza   ukuthi   basheshe   babe
buthakathaka  empilweni,  nengenza  ukuthi   bachithe   isikhathi   esiningi
besekhaya, bagcine bengasayibhekanga intuthuko yabo.

Enye indlela  ekhanya  bha  eyenziwe  uHulumeni  wethu  ukubuyisa  isithunzi
somama, ukuthi kube nesiqiniseko  sokuthi  bameleleke  ezakhiweni  ezithatha
izinqumo ngempilo yabo. Uma ubheka nje  ePhalamende,  kuyaqala  ukuthi  kube
nomama   abangaka,   ikakhulukazi    abamnyama.    Ikhebhinethi,    oSomlomo
bePhalamende, oSihlalo bamaKomiti, uSoswebhu weqembu elibusayo,  udlule  uye
emajajini, amanxusa ezwe laseNingizimu Afrika kanye nezimeya.

UHulumeni we-ANC wenze  umehluko  ocacile  kulokhu.  Enye  into  ebalulekile
ukuthi omama abanikwanga imisebenzi ebekuhlale  kuthiwa  imisebenzi  yomama.
Awukho omncane, awukho omkhulu, imisebenzi  yenziwe  yalingana.  Sekuyaphuma
nasezingqondweni zethu  ukuthi  uNgqongqoshe  wezangaPhandle  kufanele  kube
umuntu wesilisa.
Ohlelweni lweNkomfa yoBumbano lwe-Afrika ezoba  ngoJulayi  kumele  uHulumeni
wethu enze isiqiniseko sokuthi omama bamelelekile  ohleni  lohulumeni  kanye
nasohleni lwezinye izinhlangano. UHulumeni wethu angakuqikelela lokhu  ngoba
yena  uyakuqonda  ukubaluleka   komama.   Ukumeleleka   komama   kule-nkomfa
kubalulekile ngoba  ikakhulukazi  kuyoxoxwa  ngokuthula  noxolo,  nangokuthi
kumele ohulumeni baziphathe kanjani kwezombusazwe.  Kumele  omama  babekhona
lapha ngoba yibona nezingane abahlukumezeka kakhulu uma  ukuthula  kungekho.
Yibona futhi  ababulawa  yindlala,  futhi  yibona  abagcina  sebesele  bodwa
nemindeni uma kuliwa.

Ukumeleleka komama kuzokwenza  umehluko  ngoba  bona  angeke  bazibandakanye
namacebo okubulala nokuhlukunyezwa kwabantu,  ukudlwengulwa  kwamantombazane
nokudayiswa kwamantombazane ukuze  athengise  ngocansi.  Yizo  zonke  izinto
lezi ezenzeka uma ngabe kunesimo sempi.

Ngabe senza iphutha  elikhulu  uma  singabancomi  labo  mama  abasebenza  le
misebenzi evelele, ngoba noma  ngabe  yimisebenzi  okufanele  bayenze  lena,
kodwa abakwenzile ukuthi  bamele  bonke  omama.  Ukuba  abawenzi  umsebenzi,
bonke omama bebezokwahlulelwa ngabo. Lokhu kuyasisiza futhi  ekuqinisekiseni
ukuthi omama nabo banengqondo. Akukho  muntu  obatsheleka  ingqondo  ekuseni
aphinde ayithathe ntambama.

Olunye udaba olusasixakile lapha Ningizimy  Afrika  ukuhlukunyezwa  kwabantu
besifazane  kanye  nezingane,  ikakhulukazi   ezamantombazane.   Kunesikhalo
esandile kakhulu-ke esikhona lapha  emphakathini  sokuthi  uHulumeni  akenzi
lutho ukuvikela abantu besifazane. Siyi-ANC siyaphikisana  nalokho.  Kungani
siphikisana nakho na? Yingoba  uHulumeni  wethu  esebenzisana  nezinhlangano
zabantu besifazane, nguyena ogqugquzele ukuthi abantu besifazane  abazithola
sebekulesi simo babike emakhaya, emaphoyiseni,  kwezenhlalakahle  nakwezinye
izindawo.

NguHulumeni  owenze  ukuthi  indaba  yokudlwengulwa   noma   yokuhlukunyezwa
kwabantu besifazane nezingane ingafihlwa njengoba kade ifihlwa  kuqala,  uma
ikakhulukazi yenziwe izihlobo bekuthiwa indaba  yomndeni  kodwa  sekuphelile
lokho.

Abantu besimame nabo baqalile ukushaya ikhwela  futhi  bayalwisana  nalokhu.
UHulumeni uphinde  washaya  umthetho  wesigwebo  okumele  sitholwe  ngabantu
abadlwengula  izingane  ezingakakwazi  ukuthi   zizicabangele   zona   kahle
ngendlela efanelekile.  Imiphakathi  nayo  iphinde  yanikwa  igunya  lokuthi
iphikise uma kungukuthi umuntu odlwengulile kufanele athole ibheyili.

Kunezindawo ezikhona ezinye  ngezama-NGO  ezivulelwe  omama  abahlukunyeziwe
emakhaya. Ngesikhathi  ethula  inkulumo  yakhe  uMongameli  wethu  ucacisile
ukuthi amacala amaningi lapha eMzansi  Afrika  enzeka  ngempelasonto.  Lokhu
kufaka  namacala  okuhlukunyezwa  kwabantu  besifazane.  Zonke  lezi   zinto
zenzeka  phambi  kwethu  sibhekile  kodwa   bese   sithi   siyimiphakathi,``
uHulumeni wenzeni?'' Yini singazibuzi thina  kuqala  ukuthi  thina  senzeni?
Kwenziwa yini ukuthi siyimiphakathi kanye  nabanikazi  bamajoyinti  sivumele
abantu bangene nezingane emajoyintini, kodwa uHulumeni ebe  eshaye  umthetho
wokuthi akuvumelekile umuntu oneminyaka engaphansi kweyi-18  angene  athenge
utshwala ejoyintini?

Kubangelwa yini ukuthi thina sisebenzisane nabantu abahlukumeza  imiphakathi
sibaseke,   siseke   abantu   abadlwengula   izingane   zethu   nodadewethu,
sibakhokhele imali yebheyili,  uma  ikakhulukazi  kungabantwana  bethu  noma
abafowethu noma abathandiweyo bethu?  Ngabe  konke  lokhu  okubalwe  ngenhla
kudinga uHulumeni? Kanti thina sizovuka nini sizenzele?

Ukuvikelwa kwemiphakthi kudinga kakhulu  ukuthi  imiphakathi  ibambe  iqhaza
ekuzivikeleni,  iphinde  isebenzisane  namaphoyisa.   Imiphakathi   ebambene
nengafihli izigebengu ekwaziyo ukuzivikela.  Izindlela  uHulumeni  okufanele
ahlanganyele ngazo nezinhlangano zabantu  besifazane  ukuze  bakwazi  ukuthi
baxoxisane noma basize abanye abanenkinga, ukuthi  babafundise  ngamalungelo
abo nanokuthi umuntu  wenze  njani  uma  kungukuthi  mhlawumbe  uhlukunyezwe
ngokocansi.

Okunye okumele  uHulumeni  akwenze  ukuthi  afundise  nabo  abantu  besilisa
ngamalungelo abantu besifazane, njengokuthi nje  umuntu  wesimame  uma  ethi
``cha'', usuke ethi cha. Usuke engasho ukuthi ``yebo''.

Kuyinto ebalulekile ukuthi uMongameli asikhuthaze  ukuthi  sivuke  sizenzele
ngoba kukhona isimo esifufusayo sokwenza abantu babe ngokhangezile.

Kukhona asebeguqule ulimi nengqondo yabantu akade bekwazi  ukuzenzela  zonke
izinto, kusukela ekuzivikeleni kuya  ekuziphiliseni,  ngemfundisoze  yokuthi
mabahlale phansi balinde  lo  muntu  ozocindezela  inkinobho  ukuze  bathole
abakudingayo.

Omama  bayazinikela  ekusebenzeleni  amakomiti  emiphakathi   njengamakomiti
ezempilo,  ezokuvikela,  ezezikole  namanye.  Lokhu  bakwenza   ngokuxhumana
noHulumeni. Okubalulekile manje ukuthi sibaqeqeshe  ekwenzeni  lezi  zakhiwo
ukuthi zisebenze ngendlela efanelekile. Ikhono nje kuphela okufuneka  ukuthi
sililolonge ngoba bona sebeqalile bayakwenza lokho.

Uhlelo lwelima ngiyethemba lungena kalula futhi komama, ikakhulukazi  komama
be-Women's League ngoba  bona  uMongameli  wabo  wokuqala  uCharltte  Maxeka
nguyena owayegqugquzela omama ukuthi bakhe  izinhlangano  zomasingcwabisane,
izitokfela zokudla nemali yesikole, omasakhane, ozenzele nayo yonke le  nto.
Manje okubalulekile ngoba thina sinawo lo mlando, siyakwazi ukuthi  siwenze,
kufanele  kube  yithina  esihamba  phambili   silalele   ikhwela   elishaywe
nguMongameli wethu ukuze sikwazi ukuthi sivuke sizenzele futhi  senze  ilima
lokuthi siguqule izimpilo zabantu zibe ngcono.

Omama yibona ababambe iqhaza  elivelele  kosomabhizinisi  abasafufusa.  Labo
mama   ezikhathini   eziningi   bazithola    besenkingeni    ngemininingwane
yembolekomali. Iba nezihibe ngoba  nababolekisi  bezimali  abakhona  bacishe
bafane  namabhange.  Amabhizinisi  abo  agcina  engakwazi  ukusimama  kahle.
Sikuthatha  njengento  ebalulekile  ukuthi  kuzobuyekezwa   zonke   izakhiwo
ezinikwe  igunya  lokuba  zibolekise  imali   kosomabhizinisi   abasafufusa.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Mrs B O DLAMINI: Madam Speaker,  hon  President  of  South  Africa,  Deputy
President, hon members, for us in the ANC it is a  great  pleasure  to  talk
about  women's  freedom,  especially  because  our  organisation,  the  ANC,
realised earlier the need to include  women  in  the  struggle  to  liberate
South Africa.

Women were not requested or invited to participate in the struggle. This  is
because women were part of the struggle in the areas in  which  they  lived,
in the underground structures. They were also part  of  the  people's  army,
uMkhonto weSizwe. They did this with great courage.

It is the first time in South Africa that women's needs  are  considered  in
this way. If one wants to know whether the Government has improved  people's
lives, one must ask women.  Those  who  tell  the  truth  will  reply.  This
happened in different ways. The delivery of  important  things  in  people's
lives, like water, electricity, clinics, houses, classrooms  and  land,  has
made women realise that the Government is determined to  protect  them  from
doing the work that will weaken their health, causing them to  spend  a  lot
of time at home, and ending up not focusing on their development.

Another clear way made by the Government is to restore the status of  women,
and to ensure  that  they  are  represented  in  the  structures  that  make
decisions about their lives. Looking at Parliament, it  is  the  first  time
that there are so many women, especially  black  women.  Now  women  are  in
Cabinet, the Speaker of Parliament is a woman. They also  chair  committees.
The Whip of the ruling party is a woman. They  are  judges.  They  are  also
ambassadors of South Africa and some are mayors.

The ANC Government has made  a  clear  difference  on  this  issue.  Another
important thing is that women were not given the  jobs  that  are  known  as
women's jobs. There is no small or big jobs, all jobs have been made  equal.
Now minds are  changing  from  always  expecting  the  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs to be a male.

On the agenda of the  coming  Conference  on  African  Unity  in  July,  the
Government should ensure  that  women  are  represented  on  the  Government
programme and also on the party programme. Our Government can  ensure  this,
because it understands the importance of  women.  Female  representation  in
this conference is important, because the discussions will  be  about  peace
and how governments should  behave  in  politics.  Women  should  be  there,
because it is they and children that are heavily victimised if there  is  no
peace. They are the ones who die of hunger and they are left alone if  there
is war.

Women's representation is going to  be  important,  because  they  will  not
involve themselves in plans for killing, abusing other people, raping  girls
and selling girls to other countries for prostitution.

We would be making a mistake if we did not applaud those women  who  perform
these important functions, because even though these are the jobs that  they
should do, the important thing is that they are representing women. If  they
did not perform their duties well, all women would have been judged  on  the
basis of their failure. This also helps us to  show  that  women  also  have
brains. No one lends them his brain in the morning and takes it back in  the
afternoon.
Another problematic issue for us in South Africa is the raping of women  and
children, especially female babies. There is a  popular  outcry  in  society
that the Government is not doing anything to protect women. As the  ANC,  we
reject that. Why  are  we  rejecting  it?  It  is  because  our  Government,
together  with  women's  organisations,  have  encouraged  women  who  found
themselves  in  this  situation  to  report  to  families,  police,  welfare
institutions and elsewhere.

It is the Government which has encouraged breaking of the silence about  the
incidences of rape and abuse. Now it is  no  longer  as  secret  as  it  was
before, especially if these incidents are committed by a  relative,  because
in the past it was referred to as family matter, and that would be  the  end
of it.

Women have started sounding the whistle and  they  are  fighting  this.  The
Government has passed a law regarding the sentence that should be  given  to
people who rape  children  who  are  too  young  to  think  for  themselves.
Communities have also been given the authority to oppose bail if the  rapist
is granted bail.

There are places, some of whom belong to the NGOs, that are  open  to  women
who have been abused. In his state  of  the  nation  speech,  the  President
clarified that many cases here in South  Africa  occurred  during  weekends.
This includes abuse of women. All these things occur in front of  us,  while
our eyes are wide open. But as communities we say: "What has the  Government
done?" Why do we not ask ourselves what we  have  done?  What  makes  us  as
communities and shebeen owners allow people to come  to  our  shebeens  with
children, while the Government has passed a law that says  no  person  under
the age of 18 should be allowed to buy beer in the shebeen?

What makes us co-operate with people who abuse our communities?  Why  do  we
support people who rape our children and our sisters? Why do  we  bail  them
out, especially if they are our brothers, our children or  our  loved  ones?
Do all these things I have  mentioned  require  the  Government  to  resolve
them? When are we going to wake up and do things ourselves?

In protecting communities, the communities themselves should play a role  in
their  own  protection  and  they  should  co-operate   with   the   Police.
Communities that protect themselves are those that are  united  and  who  do
not hide criminals.

The ways in which the Government should team up with  women's  organisations
to help other people who are in trouble, is  to  teach  those  people  about
their rights and what one should do if she is abused sexually.

Another thing that the Government should  do  is  teach  men  about  women's
rights, like when a woman says ``no'', she means exactly that. She does  not
mean, ``yes''.

It is important that the President has encouraged  us  to  wake  up  and  do
things ourselves, because there is a situation  that  is  raising  its  ugly
head, turning people into beggars.

There are people who have changed  the  language  and  the  mindset  of  the
people who had been doing  all  these  things  themselves.  People  used  to
protect themselves by making a living for themselves. But those people  have
been told to sit down and wait for a person who will  press  a  button,  and
they will get what they want.

Women are dedicated in working for public committees, like health,  defence,
school committees and  others.  They  do  this  by  communicating  with  the
Government. The important  thing  now  is  to  train  them  to  build  these
structures so that they will work in the right way. It is  only  the  skills
that need to be honed, because they are already doing the work.

The culture of cultivating the soil together is that  of  women,  especially
those of the  Women's  League,  because  their  first  president,  Charlotte
Maxeka encouraged women to establish burial societies and stokvels to  raise
school fees, and so  there  came  Masakhane,  Vuk'uzenzele  and  many  other
organisations. What is important to us, because we have this history, is  to
lead, and heed the whistle sounded by our President, so that  we  will  wake
up and do things on our own and work together to change people's lives.

Women are the ones who play an important role in the small business  sector.
Most of the time these women find themselves in a  problem  situation  owing
to a lack of information about loans. This is a problem,  because  even  the
moneylenders that we have end up operating like banks. Their businesses  end
up undeveloped. We take this as a  serious  matter,  and  we  call  for  re-
evaluation  of  all  establishments  that  have  been  entrusted  with   the
authority of lending money to small business owners. [Applause.]]

Mnr F J VAN DEVENTER: Mevrou die Speaker, agb President, ek wil  begin  deur
te sê dat niemand met  die  doelwitte  wat  die  President  vir  Suid-Afrika
gestel het, kan verskil nie. Dit  is  net  normaal  dat  daar,  wanneer  die
President die lede van hierdie Huis sou vra om  dit  te  prioritiseer,  baie
van ons verskillende aspekte sal  beklemtoon  of  verskillende  prioritieite
sou hê. Ek het begrip vir die situasie en ek het  begrip  vir  die  probleme
waarmee die President werk.

Daar is by uitstek twee groepe mense in Suid-Afrika wat met die erfenis  van
die geskiedenis sit. Aan die een kant is  daar  die  Afrikaner  en  aan  die
ander kant is daar, om dit só te  identifiseer,  die  swartmense  van  Suid-
Afrika. Een is die slagoffer van die erfenis van kolonialisme en  die  ander
een is die slagoffer van kolonialisme en apartheid. Daar  is  sekerlik  rede
vir albei hierdie groepe om  met  groot  emosie  vas  te  gryp  aan  hierdie
erfenis uit die geskiedenis wat op ons pad gekom het.

Ek wil vanmiddag in groot erns  vir  hierdie  Parlement  as  die  wetgewende
liggaam van Suid-Afrika sê dat hoe langer ons ons laat  vasvang  in  emosies
wat ons kragte uitput, hoe minder gaan ons tyd hê en  hoe  minder  gaan  ons
die krag en die vermoë hê om die toekoms van Suid-Afrika aan  te  raak.  Met
die waters wat verby is, sal die meule  nooit  weer  maal  nie.  Dit  is  'n
Afrikaanse spreuk wat nie net impliseer dat die water wegloop nie, maar  ook
dat die krag wat daardie water saam met hom vat, daarmee  heen  is.  Ek  wil
vanmiddag 'n beroep doen  dat  ons  die  emosies  waarmee  ons  die  verlede
oproep, opsy sal skuif en met toewyding sal kyk na  die  toekoms  van  Suid-
Afrika.

Suid-Afrika en Afrika  moet  dringend  ontslae  raak  van  sy  selfopgelegde
martelaarskap ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr F J VAN DEVENTER: Madam Speaker, hon  President,  I  want  to  start  by
saying that no one can differ with the objectives for South Africa that  the
President has expounded. It is normal, if the  President  were  to  ask  the
members of this House to prioritise them, that many of  us  would  emphasise
different aspects or that we would have different priorities.  I  understand
the situation and I understand the problems the President is dealing with.

There are primarily two groups of people in South Africa who  have  to  bear
the legacy of history. On the one hand there is the  Afrikaner  and  on  the
other there are the black people of South Africa. One is the victim  of  the
legacy of colonialism and  the  other  is  the  victim  of  colonialism  and
apartheid. There are certainly reasons for  both  these  groups  with  great
emotion to react to these legacies from history that have  come  across  our
path.

This afternoon I want to say with all seriousness in this Parliament as  the
legislative body of South Africa that the longer we allow  ourselves  to  be
caught up in these emotions  that  sap  our  strength,  the  less  time  and
ability we will have to change the future of South Africa. ``Met die  waters
wat verby is, sal die meule nooit weer maal  nie''.  [The  mill  will  never
again be driven by water that has already  passed.]  This  is  an  Afrikaans
proverb that not only implies that water  flows  away,  but  also  that  the
power associated with the water  is  gone.  I  want  to  make  a  plea  this
afternoon, that we set aside the emotions with which we recall the past  and
that we look towards the future of South Africa with dedication.

South Africa and  Africa  must  urgently  rid  itself  of  its  self-imposed
martyrdom ...]

... as a suffering country and suffering continent, owing  to  the  historic
role that other nations played in Africa. Those things belong to  the  past.
Nobody can change history, but we can make a meaningful  contribution  to  a
better future.

I want to say to the President that I believe  that  South  Africa  is  well
placed to change not only our country's image of suffering  and  struggling,
but also of Africa, by emphasising the opportunities vested in  our  country
and continent. It is not a shame to say to the  world  that  we  need  their
help,  knowledge,  skills  and   financial   resources   to   unlock   these
opportunities for the future wellbeing of our people. However,  let  us  put
something on the table to negotiate with the world. Nobody  and  no  country
in the world will help us to eradicate poverty if we approach them with  the
attitude that they must give so that we can resolve our problems.

Countries operate and react like people. For example,  a  few  years  ago  a
South African company made shares available on the JSE at  half  the  market
price to people from the disadvantaged communities. A  person,  someone  not
disadvantaged at all, but who qualified, made a profit of nearly R1  million
within six months. When he told me about this I said to him that I  believed
he was going to donate 10% of his profit to  poverty  relief  projects.  His
reaction was: ``Are you mad? That is my money. I am not  going  to  give  it
away!'' However, he expected other people to make substantial  donations  to
the aforementioned cause. That is unfortunately  the  psychological  make-up
of people and nations.

We must prove to the world that we are not a  nation  in  despair.  We  must
prove our willingness to share opportunities in return for  development  and
job creation.

In conclusion, I want to make an appeal, especially to the  members  of  the
Cabinet, not to play up prosperity against poverty. Without  prosperity  one
can never  eradicate  poverty.  On  the  contrary,  we  must  encourage  the
business world to expand, the rich to invest and  the  labour  organisations
to find a balance between the rightful needs of their  members  on  the  one
hand, whilst, on the other  protecting  the  rights  of  employers  to  earn
profits on their investments to such an extent  that  it  is  profitable  to
expand to the benefit of all.

Let us become opportunity-driven, with less suffering and  less  struggling.
The image that we are carrying out of this country  is  very  dangerous  for
the future wellbeing of South Africa.

Niemand in die wêreld sal aanhoudend 'n helpende hand uitsteek na mense  wat
hulself beskryf en voorhou as sukkelend, hulpeloos en  moedeloos  nie.  Daar
is  sóveel  geleenthede.  Ons  het   soveel   hulpbronne   in   Suid-Afrika,
byvoorbeeld ons menslike hulpbronne, ons grondstowwe en  ons  basiese  goeie
wil teenoor mekaar in hierdie land. Kom ons gebruik dit in  die  belang  van
Suid-Afrika.

In die Karoo het ons 'n voëltjie wat daar rondspring, gewoonlik van  miskoek
tot miskoek. Agb Speaker,  as  u  my  die  woord  sal  vergewe,  hulle  word
strontvoëltjies genoem in Karootaal, want hulle spring so  van  miskoek  tot
miskoek en maak altyd dieselfde ou geluidjies. Ek wil aan die agb  President
sê hy moet hom nie  te  veel  steur  aan  daardie  voëltjies  hier  aan  ons
linkerkant wat so spring van miskoek tot miskoek nie.  Hulle  staan  in  die
pad van Suid-Afrika en die  goeie  toekoms  wat  vir  hierdie  land  voorlê.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[No one in the world will keep  extending  a  helping  hand  to  people  who
define and depict themselves as struggling,  helpless  and  hopeless.  There
are so many opportunities. We have so many resources in  South  Africa,  for
example, human resources, our minerals and our basic good will  towards  one
another in this country. Let us use this in the interest of South Africa.

In the Karoo there is a little bird that hops around, usually  from  cow-pat
to cow-pat. Hon Speaker, if you would forgive me for using the word, in  the
language of the Karoo  they  are  called  ``strontvoëltjies''  [dung  birds]
because they hop from cow-pat to cow-pat and always make the  same  chirping
noises. I want to tell the hon President that he should  not  pay  too  much
attention to those little birds here on our left who  hop  from  cow-pat  to
cow-pat. They are in South Africa's way and the way of the good future  that
lies ahead for this country. [Applause.]]

Mr N H MASITHELA: Madam Speaker, in recognising the importance of the  youth
and the important role they play in  society,  a  great  leader  of  Africa,
Reginald Oliver Tambo, said, and I quote:


  A country that does not value its youth does not deserve its future.

One thing I know is that  under  the  leadership  of  the  President,  South
Africa values its youth and deserves its future. But who is the youth?  They
earn themselves names such as shock troopers of the revolution. I am  saying
this to illustrate that the concept of youth is not only restricted to  age.
It  also  includes  a  specific  level   of   psychological   and   physical
development. Hence youth is defined as the transition between childhood  and
adulthood  and  includes  the  stages  of  puberty,  adolescence  and  young
adulthood. In this case the representation of youth  in  the  South  African
population is important to illustrate.

Some 39% of South African society is aged between 14 and 35  years,  25%  of
the population is under the age of 15, whilst 4% is  over  the  age  of  65.
Indeed, young people  comprise  a  substantial  part  of  society  in  South
Africa.  This  illustrates  that  there  has  to  be  major  human  resource
development as there could  be  a  need  for  an  agent  of  social  change,
economic development and technological  innovation,  particularly  in  South
Africa, where a  substantial  part  of  our  population  consists  of  young
people. They are indeed the future.

Youth development,  therefore,  impacts  on  the  future  prospects  of  our
country, both politically and economically. In the main,  the  character  of
South African youth has been formed by the urgent need  for  transformation,
and, at the same time, a radical pace in  the  struggle  for  progress.  The
impact of the culmination of  the  radical  plan  of  action  in  the  early
forties, which was championed by,  amongst  others,  young  people  such  as
Walter Sisulu, Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo, is a classic example. It  is
also in this vein that the youth has always formed  an  important  part  and
component of liberation movements and, indeed, strived towards  achieving  a
better life for our people.

In recognising the natural pace of young people in democratic South  Africa,
the ANC established centres of learning, education and training  on  foreign
soil. The Solomon Mahlangu College is a classic example. This  was  part  of
an attempt to ensure that youth education and development was based on self-
worth and youth - people who  could  participate  in  the  democratic  South
Africa.

In 1994 there was recognition from Government's point of view, and  that  of
youth organisations, that was characterised by the need to establish  policy
frameworks and institutions. The reconstruction and  development  principles
which focused on the need for education and training and  job  creation  and
enabling young people to realise their full potential, formed the  basis  of
this process.

There are institutions and policy initiatives such  as  the  National  Youth
Commission, the National Youth Service, the  President's  Awards  and  Youth
Empowerment Southern Africa, of which Madam Speaker became  chair  in  1997.
This award has registered remarkable success among an increasing  number  of
young people, particularly among prison inmates, who  make  sure  that  they
will not go back to prison, because they have acquired  skills  and  can  be
employed and absorbed by the economy.

The establishment of the Umsobomvu Trust is one of the classic  examples  of
Government putting in more money to ensure that  the  development  of  young
people is taken care of. On the 90th anniversary of the ANC,  the  President
reflected  on  the  1955  congress  of  the  People  commitment   to   youth
development. As a living document since the middle of the 20th century,  the
Freedom Charter stated:  ``The  doors  of  learning  and  culture  shall  be
opened.''

As the President  further  elaborated,  this  entailed  the  fact  that  the
charter teaches our young people to love and honour  their  culture.  Within
these conditions, business, individuals and communities in  all  sectors  of
our society are becoming more involved  in  creating  jobs,  empowering  the
youth to participate in our economy.

There are practical examples concerning this issue. The South African  Youth
Chamber of Commerce is involved in a project to develop youth potential  and
participate in the economy. The Agape Copeland Train is  a  classic  example
of an individual business  initiative  involved  in  the  social  upliftment
programmes to develop young people.

However,  I  also  need  to  take  this  opportunity  to   appeal   to   all
businesspeople who have yet to heed the call. I want  to  inform  them  that
young people are not asking for favours or charity, but for partnership.  It
is important for businesspeople who did not  come  to  participate  in  this
economic development to heed the call that has been made by the President.

Re a tseba Mopresidente hore mmuso o ile wa etsa matsapa a hore batho  bohle
ba batlang ho theha mesebetsi ba kgone ho etsa jwalo mahaeng  a  rona,  empa
borakgwebo ha ba a ka ba tloha ba mametse kopo e entsweng, hobane ba  nahana
hore ba  ke  ke  ba  sebetsa  mahaeng.  (Translation  of  Sesotho  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr President, we know that the Government did try to make it  possible  for
those people who wanted to establish businesses in our homelands to  do  so,
but the businesspeople did not respond positively to the Government's  call,
because they thought that they could not work in the former homelands.]

It is a  challenge  for  the  ANC  and  Government  in  particular  to  make
available  some  incentives  to  businesspeople  and  ensure  that  all  the
challenges that we are confronted with are also their responsibility.

I should also take responsibility and state that young  people  should  heed
the call of the President. On 8 January the call was made in the  spirit  of
Letsima. Four days later ...

... batjha ba mane Mahlatswetsa, Excelsior, ba ka bang 175,ba ile ba  kopana
ho hlwekisa dikolo tse nne ka hare ho Mahlatswetsa.  Hona  ho  bontsha  hore
batjha, ha ho eptjwa pitso, ba tla mamela seo baetapele ba  buang  ka  sona.
(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[... about 175 of the youth of Mahlatswetsa, in Excelsior, came together  to
clean four schools in  the  Mahlatswetsa  community.  This  shows  that  the
youth, when a call is made  by  leaders,  respond  positively  to  what  the
leaders are saying.]

I am raising this, because the challenge facing the  Government  in  respect
of this particular matter is that it must create an environment in which  it
could absorb young volunteers in  the  same  Government  institutions.  This
will ensure,  when  young  people  wish  to  make  contributions,  that  the
Government has established mechanisms to that effect. Young people  are  the
first to heed the call and the last to retreat. [Applause.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Madam Speaker,  your  Excellencies  the  President  and  the
Deputy President, Ministers and Deputy Ministers and the House at large,  in
view of the recent celebrations  of  Umkhonto  weSizwe's  40th  anniversary,
allow me to commence by dedicating my contribution to this debate  not  only
to the many heroes and heroines both sung and unsung, who  laid  down  their
own lives for the attainment of  the  goals  of  democracy,  liberty,  human
rights and justice which we  are  all  enjoying  today  here  and  elsewhere
today, but, also to the many  people  who  became  permanently  disabled  in
pursuit of these ideals.

We in the ANC are fully conscious of how  costly  the  attainment  of  these
ideals can be, hence our commitment to peace and to spreading the gospel  of
the peaceful  resolution  of  disputes  rather  than  resorting  to  violent
confrontation throughout the world. [Applause.]

Disability is one of the most reliable and vivid barometers to  measure  the
extent to which humanity has progressed, retrogressed or  simply  stagnated.
War, violence and the use of force, poverty, disease, starvation  and  legal
safety standards, ignorance, indifference and  prejudice  all  compound  the
high incidence of the hardship occasioned by disability  in  the  developing
world. It is therefore most appropriate that the OAU deemed fit  to  declare
the first decade  of  the  African  millennium  as  the  African  Decade  of
Disabled Persons.

Allow me once again to express appreciation for the erudite  leadership  and
statesmanship demonstrated  by  the  President,  with  the  support  of  his
dedicated Cabinet, together  with  other  heads  of  state  in  Africa,  for
translating the vision of an African renaissance into a  concrete  programme
of action in the form of Nepad. [Applause.]

The past two decades have seen the rise of the disability  rights  movement,
which has contributed significantly to  the  transformation  of  the  global
policy on disability.  On  3  December  1982,  which  date  has  since  been
declared the International Day of Disabled Persons, the UN General  Assembly
adopted the world programme of action concerning disabled  persons,  and  at
the same time declared 1983 to 1992 as the international Decade of  Disabled
People, and as a timeframe within which member states were  called  upon  to
implement that programme.

Disabled People South Africa, since its inception in 1984, has been  at  the
forefront of the struggle  for  the  rights  of  disabled  people  in  South
Africa. In response to a demand by disabled people to  implement  the  world
programme of action, the then apartheid regime declared  1986  the  national
Year of the Disabled  and  established  an  interdepartmental  co-ordinating
committee on disability, which in 1987  presented  a  report  proposing  new
policies on disability.

This initiative was rejected by Disabled People South Africa, DPSA,  firstly
because the apartheid philosophy which underpinned this policy proposal  was
incongruent with the notion of equalisation of opportunities  for  the  deaf
people and their full participation in society, as  espoused  in  the  world
programme of action. Secondly, it was rejected because the  apartheid  state
continued through its repressive machinery to  kill  and  maim  our  people,
thereby undermining one of the cardinal goals  of  the  world  programme  of
action, namely the prevention of disability.

In  1991  DPSA  embarked  on  an  alternative  strategy  by  launching   the
Disability Rights Charter Campaign, with the support of  Lawyers  for  Human
Rights, to conscientise disabled people throughout the country  about  their
rights and to mobilise them in advocating for the inclusion of their  rights
in the new constitutional dispensation that was then about to unfold.

Allow me at this juncture to pause to echo the  sentiments  of  millions  of
disabled South Africans out there by expressing our sincere appreciation  to
his  Excellency  the  President  for   demonstrating   commitment   to   the
advancement of  disabled  people,  by  publishing  the  White  Paper  on  an
integrated disability strategy in 1997.

Central to this document, which  constitutes  official  national  policy  on
disability  and  which  is  a  product  of   extensive   consultation   with
organisations of and for  disabled  people,  is  a  paradigm  shift  from  a
medical to a social model in the design of national policy on disability.
`
The World Health Organisation, in  its  publication  entitled  International
Classification of Functioning and Disability of  July  1999,  explains  this
dialectic as follows:


  The medical model views disability as a personal problem directly  caused
  by disease, trauma or other health  conditions,  which  requires  medical
  care provided in the form of individual treatment by professionals.


  Management of the  disability  is  aimed  at  cure  or  the  individual's
  adjustment or behaviour changes. Medical care is viewed as the main issue
  and at the political level, the principal response is that  of  modifying
  or reforming health care policy.

The World Health Organisation document proceeds to state:


  The social model of disability, on the other hand, sees the issue  mainly
  as a socially created problem and principally as a  matter  of  the  full
  integration of individuals into society. Disability is not  an  attribute
  of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many  of
  which are created by the social environment. Hence the management of  the
  problem requires social action, and it is the  collective  responsibility
  of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for
  the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social
  life.


  The issue is therefore an attitudinal or ideological one requiring social
  change which at the political level becomes a question of human rights.

The call, made by the ANC during the celebration  of  its  90th  anniversary
earlier this year, of Letsima is a revival of the  true  African  spirit  of
collective action towards the attainment of a better life for all. This  for
disabled people must mean an opportunity to be included  in  all  activities
in their communities, aimed at the advancement of the society as a whole.

In his  state  of  the  nation  address  last  Friday,  his  Excellency  the
President called upon the nation to reflect on whether  progress  was  being
made in advancing the constitutional rights of disabled people,  a  question
which is the primary focus of my input today. Since 1994  South  Africa  has
made significant progress in  advancing  the  rights  of  disabled  persons,
starting with the expressed prohibition of unfair  discrimination  based  on
disability contained in the equality clause of the Bill  of  Rights  in  the
interim constitution, and carried through in the current Constitution.

Building on this foundation, the  current  Labour  Relations  Act  of  1995,
unlike its predecessor, expressly prohibits  unfair  discrimination  on  the
grounds of disability as an unfair labour practice.  The  Employment  Equity
Act of 1998 carries this ideal  a  step  further  by,  in  addition  to  the
introduction of affirmative action, introducing the doctrine  of  reasonable
accommodation into our labour legislation, in terms of which employers  have
the  additional  responsibility  of  taking  reasonable   measures   towards
ensuring the full integration  and  full  participation  of  employees  with
disabilities in the workplace, unless such employers  can  demonstrate  that
taking such measures will result in such employers suffering undue  hardship
due to practical difficulties or prohibitive costs associated therewith.

More  recently,  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and  Prevention   of   Unfair
Discrimination Act, 2000, passed by the House, expanded  these  rights  well
beyond the employment sphere. However, we need now  to  take  stock  of  the
extent to which all these  measures  have  succeeded  in  improving  of  the
quality of life and status of disabled persons.  Institutions  such  as  the
Office on the Status of Disabled  Persons,  led  by  Minister  Essop  Pahad,
which  plays  a  pivotal  role   in   co-ordinating   and   monitoring   the
implementation  the  integrated  national  disability  strategy,  the  Human
Rights  Commission,  the  Gender  Commission  and  the  parliamentary  Joint
Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of Quality of  Life  and  Status  of
Children, Youth and  Disabled  Persons  have  a  crucial  role  to  play  in
ensuring that these ideals are attained.

I also wish to express appreciation to Parliament for the  measures  it  has
taken thus far towards ensuring that it becomes  more  user-friendly  and  a
welcoming environment to all disabled members of Parliament, staff  and  the
public in general, through the  provision  of  Braille  facilities  for  the
visually impaired, sign language interpreters  for  the  deaf,  as  well  as
ramps,  accessible  parking  and  ablution  facilities  for  the  physically
disabled. [Applause.]

In addition and in line with the ANC-led Government's  commitment  with  the
goal of creating a better life for all, the resolve by  Government  to  make
poverty eradication the first national priority is a  significant  political
commitment for disabled people, for it is  true  that  poverty  is  a  major
contributor to the incidence and prevalence of disability  and,  conversely,
that disability aggravates the impact of poverty as it  further  drains  the
meagre resources of communities.

Vuk'uzenzele is therefore a call that  must  be  extended  to  the  disabled
people as well to ensure that they, too,  rise  to  the  occasion  and  take
their rightful place  in  society.  Social  grants  alone,  though  a  vital
cushion against poverty that must be  safeguarded,  cannot  suffice  in  the
fight for the complete eradication of social exclusion  and  the  attainment
of a better life for all. [Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker,  hon  President  and  hon  Deputy  President,
there was an unwarranted attack on me yesterday by the  Minister  of  Safety
and Security. I want to move today that  we  change  his  name  to  that  of
Minister of Safety and Security called  ``Steve  Kimberley''.  Kimberley  is
famous for the big hole, in Afrikaans ``die  groot  gat''.  [Interjections.]
The ANC keeps calling the opposition parties all kinds  of  names,  racists,
opportunists and all that. We can do the same. They say  in  real  life  two
wrongs do not make a right, but in  politics  they  do.  The  praise-singing
that he has been subjected to for the past two days is  really  getting  out
of hand. I think the hon President, as the  judge,  will  have  a  difficult
task electing a winner.

The report  that  the  Minister  referred  to  is  like  that.  We  are  not
criticising the President. We are questioning  the  report.  And  we  cannot
accept just one source as being the truth and the Bible.  We  cannot  accept
one academic and one report. The 65% rating of Mr Esterhuyse is  arrived  at
only with regard to issues raised in the President's  state  of  the  nation
address in 2001. When one wants to judge the President and  his  performance
we must look at all the departments.  That  report  did  not  refer  to  the
Health department, Education, Welfare or any of them. So,  it  cannot  be  a
true reflection. The other thing is  that  Mr  Esterhuyse  only  used  press
releases and speeches to assess the performance. That is wrong.

In the fight against Aids  the  people  have  spoken  about  mother-to-child
transmission. The time has come for us to move on to provide  HIV  care  and
treatment and support for the whole family. The families  make  a  community
and communities make a society.  If  society  feels  that  Government  cares
about its citizens in a meaningful way we will turn  the  tide  against  HIV
and Aids. We must ensure that we do not lose hope. Do not fight  death,  but
support life, as Archbishop Ndungane of Cape Town said. [Applause.]

Mr A G LYLE: Madam Speaker, Comrade President, Comrade Deputy President  and
hon  members,  local  government  transformation  finds  a  well-suited  and
deserved niche in the rebirth of  the  African  continent,  which  is  aptly
referred to by the President as the African Renaissance.

Central  to  the  rebirth  of  Africa,  as  the  President  has  stated,  is
overcoming centuries of poverty, hunger, disease and underdevelopment.  This
call, therefore, demands that we be the initiators of our own  solutions  as
Africans - this is a salient point for local government to  take  cognisance
of.

For  local  government  to  express  itself  maximally  within  the  African
Renaissance programme, it will  have  to  ensure  that  its  programmes  are
people-driven. The  current  and  forthcoming  pieces  of  local  government
legislation are not an end in themselves, but  a  vehicle  that  provides  a
conducive environment for the people to take control of their own destiny.

South Africa  is  one  of  the  few  countries  in  the  world  where  local
government  has  recognised  communities  as  an   integral   component   of
municipalities. Communities form an integral part  of  the  development  and
decision-making processes of local government.

The new system of local government provides very  clear  guidelines  on  how
communities can actively  participate  in  the  day-to-day  running  of  the
council, thus taking control of their lives. The Municipal  Systems  Act  of
2000  provides  for  the  active  participation  of  the  residents   of   a
municipality in the formulation  of  a  budget  and  integrated  development
plans.

The participation of our people in a democratic system of  governance  gives
expression to the resolutions of the historic People's Congress in  Kliptown
about four and a half decades ago, namely that ``the people shall  govern''.
We want to remind members of the opposition parties, in  particular  the  DA
and the PAC, that the ruling  party  has  long  resolved  that  power  shall
reside with the people.
The environment created by the new system of  local  government  facilitates
people's  participation  in  the  broader  realm  of  economic  and   social
development.  [Interjections.]  Just   listen!    We   expect   that   local
government, in its transformation processes, will not only render the  basic
services that our people so desperately need, but will also  facilitate  the
notion of a developmental local government, thus  attracting  investors  and
creating employment and a tax base.

Local government is  an  unequivocal  conduit  between  Government  and  the
masses. It must become a repository of information  and  knowledge  for  its
residents, in particular the rural communities. The President  talked  about
the improvement of efficiency in Government. We call  upon  organised  local
government  to  heed  this  call  by  intensifying  its  skills  development
programme in its political  and  managerial  components  so  as  to  further
improve on governance and the quality of service delivery.

Through the Seta this sphere of government must embark on  a  sustained  and
ambitious drive in skills development. The President, in his statement on  8
January, speaks about people being their own liberators. Indeed, this is  an
essential element in the transformation of our nation. It is at  this  point
that people become masters of their own fate.

This sphere of government must extricate itself from the mould of  being  an
agent of service delivery  only.  The  role  of  local  government  and  its
efficacy in our democracy rests squarely on the  shoulders  of  the  elected
representatives. The element of empathy in councillors  must  be  a  visible
characteristic of their daily interaction with  communities.  Municipalities
and their communities must occupy the frontline  in  the  struggle  for  the
reconstruction and development of our country. It is at this  juncture  that
local government becomes an indispensable factor for a better life  for  all
in the realm of governance.

The ANC has initiated the rendering of voluntary service to  the  people  of
South Africa. We  want  to  see  local  government  pursue  this  noble  and
rewarding  programme  by  embracing  people  from  all  walks  of  life  and
political persuasions.

Nepad,  as  our  President  has  indicated,  is  to  consider  specific  and
implementable development programmes, with the elimination  of  poverty  and
underdevelopment on our continent as their central objective.  Surely  local
government must be one of those vehicles in  the  pursuance  of  this  noble
vision.

It is therefore incumbent on this sphere  of  government  to  synergise  its
activities with whatever programmes in which our Government participates  in
Nepad, so that we as South Africans walk in tandem with the rest  of  Africa
as we endeavour to eradicate  the  scourge  of  poverty  and  other  factors
inhibiting development.  There  will  be  those  who  stubbornly  refuse  to
acknowledge the progress we have made since 1994, but the  facts  speak  for
themselves.

Reasonable  progress  has  been  made  in  the  supply  of  potable   water,
sanitation, electricity, houses and clinics. As  a  black  citizen  of  this
country who was previously disadvantaged, I need to say that in  the  humble
village where I come  from,  since  1996  women  no  longer  walk  a  three-
kilometre journey with 25 litres of water on their  heads.  This  Government
has given us potable, reticulated water. [Applause.] In the village where  I
come from, since 1999 women no longer have to cut trees down  for  firewood.
This Government has electrified our  village.  [Applause.]  In  the  village
where I come from a clinic was  nonexistent.  Today  the  clinic  is  within
walking distance. [Applause.]

However, local government  is  still  faced  with  challenges  such  as  the
transformation process, which is arduous and  time-consuming.  New  informal
settlements and illegal occupations, the capacity of  local  government  and
acceleration of provision of water  and  sanitation,  and  a  pragmatic  and
visionary local Government in a community will in future reap the fruits  of
its efforts. [Applause.]

Prof S S RIPINGA: Madam Speaker, His  Excellencies  the  President  and  the
Deputy President, hon members of the National Assembly, we in  the  ANC  and
the masses of the people in  the  country  welcome  the  people's  campaign,
Vuk'uzenzele, a clarion call to involve oneself in development in one's  own
community and one's country at large. Development economists agree  -  these
are also unsolicited views, it is their  own  publication  -  that,  in  the
development context, people cannot be developed,  they  develop  themselves.
They develop themselves by their own full participation -  as  equals  -  in
the lives of the communities they live in. It is in this  context  that  the
President appeals to hon members and  our  compatriots  in  the  country  at
large to embrace the people's campaign, Vuk'uzenzele.

The political transition in South Africa has projected us  into  the  global
arena, exposing us to pressures and challenges that require  innovative  and
flexible responses to a  rapidly  changing  global  environment.  The  major
challenge would  be  to  integrate  successfully  into  global  systems  and
communities while addressing the local needs and aspirations of our  people.
In the President's words:


  We have to devote the necessary resources to scientific and technological
  research and development,  including  biotechnology.  We  must  encourage
  innovation and ensure that as many  of  our  people  as  possible  muster
  modern technologies and integrate  them  into  their  social  activities,
  including education, delivery of services and economic activity.

The world is indeed in the throes of a revolution which will change  forever
the way we live, work, plan, organise our societies  and  ultimately  define
ourselves. We shall therefore need to  develop  our  strategic  response  to
globalisation and the building of a better life for our people. The  ANC  is
convinced that a transformed scientific and technological  revolution  seems
to provide an appropriate response to the current situation.

South Africa depends mostly on the export of its raw materials,  the  income
from which has been gradually eroding over the past years not  only  because
of the advent of competing new material and processes but also  because  our
commodities are still in the raw form. Gold is a case in point. We  need  to
add value to our commodities and transform them. And for  this  we  need  to
apply science and technology. It is here that the ANC sees the  urgent  need
for building and utilising capacities in science and technology in order  to
have the income to support the economy, so as to build  a  better  life  for
our people.

Urban and rural communities need to be  assisted  and  encouraged  to  adopt
social and technological innovations which will  assist  them  in  decision-
making and enhance their ability to make informed choices  on  environmental
sustainability, health care provision,  meeting  basic  needs  at  community
level, reducing the total cost of infrastructure  provision,  and  providing
safety and security.
South Africa will not be able to realise its  growth  potential  in  science
and technology without the introduction of  clearly  defined  mechanisms  to
ensure that the spin-offs of technology advancement do not have  a  negative
impact. Scientific and technological advancement should therefore  never  be
to the detriment of the environment.

Forced migrations to rural areas during the era  of  apartheid  reduced  the
productive capacity of  agricultural  land.  The  ruthless  exploitation  of
forests and land has made the soil less productive. All  these  things  have
led to reduced food  production.  Ensuring  food  security  and  sustainable
development through the appropriate use of science and  technology  is  very
strategic under these circumstances.

The most important area of  capacity-building  in  respect  of  science  and
technology is clearly  through  education.  At  the  core  of  this  is  the
obligation to provide basic education to all. We  in  the  ANC  ensure  that
girl children are encouraged to choose mathematics, science  and  technology
as subjects. We  also  need  to  demystify  the  teaching  and  learning  of
mathematics, science and technology.
We shall also ensure that we introduce appropriate  curricula,  particularly
incorporating basic scientific  concepts,  as  early  as  possible  and  the
development of a culture of science and  technology.  In  order  to  sustain
capacity and promote research and development  at  the  highest  level,  the
Department of Education plans to increase graduate  enrolment  and  outputs,
in the masters' and doctoral  levels,  in  particular;  business,  commerce,
science, engineering and technology.

Science and technology should not reside in the hands of the elite. It  must
reach  down  to  all  levels  of  society  and  achieve  a  balance  between
individuals and social groups. Analysis of  some  basic  telecom  indicators
provide stark evidence of how  far  we  have  fallen  in  the  communication
stage. It also highlights how much still needs to be  done  before  the  so-
called digital divide+ can be bridged.

We welcome the President's endeavours to fast-track  information  technology
in our country. For  example,  the  establishment  of  telecentres  and  the
completion of work on the establishment of an ICT university, and  also  the
donation that we are looking forward to actually to support  the  Department
of Education in its endeavour to provide computer hardware and  software  in
our schools. We have 19 094 schools without computers, that  is  70,3%,  and
all of them are in the most disadvantaged communities.

There is also a growing awareness of the need to develop a system that  will
ensure  the  projection  of  science  and   technology   10   years   beyond
laboratories,  lecture  theatres  and  research  rooms  into   the   broader
consciousness of the population.

It needs to reach the people on the ground - the  ordinary  people.  Science
and technology, with its immense value to South Africans, cannot be seen  in
isolation. It should rather be  regarded  as  an  interaction  between  many
institutions, organisations, individuals and  ideas  in  the  pursuit  of  a
common set of social and economic goals.

Without the establishment and harnessing of a strong science and  technology
sector, South Africa will not succeed in moving towards  equity.  This  view
is strongly supported by the White Paper on Science  and  Technology,  which
states that the aggressive promotion of the principle of life-long  learning
will provide the best  opportunity  to  meet  our  objectives.  Science  and
technology will play a vital role in the words  of  the  hon  the  President
``... in pushing back the frontiers of poverty and  expanding  access  to  a
better life''. [Applause.]

Mr D M BAKKER: Madam Speaker, so far this debate on  the  President's  state
of  the  nation  address  sounds  like  two  different  debates,  about  two
different countries, on two different continents.

Hon Minister Buthelezi referred to a half-full glass. In this  debate,  some
opposition members described our country as a  half-empty  glass  containing
fear, anger, pessimism and despair. They spent 30 seconds waving  the  South
African flag and the rest of the time trampling all over it.  On  the  other
hand, my party wants to be part of a half-full glass, with a  clear  message
of shaping our future, of taking pride in our  own,  of  enthusiasm  and  of
building our country. [Applause.]

The state of the nation address was not the launch of short-term, attention-
grabbing schemes, but an assured statement of  intent  on  the  Government's
tasks and programme. I would like to compliment the  hon  President  on  his
confident commitment to sustaining an open economy.  This  bullish  approach
is exactly the signal that South Africa needs.

I would like to say to Mr President that his impassioned plea to  all  South
Africans to involve themselves in making this country a  better  place  will
achieve the necessary results. Our sense  of  purpose  and  loyalty  demands
that we fix our sights on our common future so as to  best  to  utilise  our
abilities and to create a winning nation.

Die heel belangrikste van die President se toespraak  is  die  klem  wat  hy
geplaas het op die waardevolste bate van hierdie  land,  naamlik  sy  mense.
Alhoewel daar nog baie probleme is,  en  rassisme  steeds  bestaan,  is  die
gesindheid van ons mense ons belangrikste boublok. Ongelukkig hoor  ons  nie
genoeg van die helde wat onbaatsugtige diens lewer om die lot van mede-Suid-
Afrikaners te verlig nie. Dit is jammer dat nie meer van  hierdie  heldedade
en suksesverhale die koerante se voorblaaie en  die  hoofnuus  op  televisie
haal  nie.  Baie  van  ons  mense  wil  met  mekaar  praat  en  bou  aan  'n
gemeenskaplike patriotisme. Ons land kan alleenlik slaag  as  ons  jongmense
weer met 'n vonkel in die oog entoesiasties oor die toekoms sal  wees.  Daar
is genoeg rede om te glo dat dit  haalbaar  is.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[What is of paramount importance in the President's speech is  the  emphasis
he placed on the most valuable asset of this country, its  people.  Although
there are still many problems, and racism still exists, the  most  important
building block still remains the attitudes of our people.  Unfortunately  we
do not  hear  enough  of  the  heroes  who  make  available  their  services
unselfishly to alleviate the plight of fellow South Africans. It is a  shame
that not more of these heroic deeds  and  success  stories  make  the  front
pages of the newspapers or television's main news broadcasts.  Many  of  our
people want to talk to one another and work  towards  a  common  patriotism.
Our country can only succeed if our youth can once again, with a twinkle  in
the eye, be optimistic about the future. There is enough reason  to  believe
that this is attainable.]

Unfortunately, we cannot have a common patriotism if it  is  only  owned  by
some of our people. Some people, especially  in  our  minority  communities,
feel alienated or threatened. Too often  one  hears  of  people  opting  for
emigration or planning to get their money out of South Africa.  If  our  own
people are not confident to invest in our country,  how  can  we  expect  to
attract  sustainable  foreign  investment?  We   cannot   afford   to   lose
professional people. We cannot afford to lose  their  skills.  Our  greatest
challenge is to get to  know  our  fellow  countrymen  and  to  build  trust
amongst ourselves.

Asian Afrikaner I stand rooted  in  the  African  soil.  This  contains  the
meaning of my heritage. I have nowhere else to go.  I  do  not  want  to  go
anywhere else. My  people  want  to  belong  and  contribute  in  their  own
country. [Applause.]

Our children are children of a new South Africa, and  they  will  break  new
ground. We have the will and the determination to  succeed.  My  vision  and
commitment, and that of my party, is to cultivate a new society of  men  and
women whose loyalty is, firstly, to the Constitution  of  this  country.  We
are striving to foster reconciliation and good intercommunity  relations  to
achieve a truly nonracial, nonsexist  society  so  that,  together,  we  can
address the legacy of our past and be part of the debate on our future.

We want to move to a point at which  South  Africans  can  talk  about  each
other as none other than South Africans, without  the  prefix  of  black  or
white. [Applause.] For us, South Africa is an African  country.  Within  the
African continent, we all have an important role to play in the  development
of both our country and the continent, and to bring about  the  much  talked
about Renaissance.

The New NP will be part of developing a unity of  purpose  to  confront  the
great  challenges  of  our   country,   including   poverty,   unemployment,
homelessness, crime and Aids. For these goals we make no  excuses.  We  will
be part of a solution. [Applause.]

Mr L ZITA: Madam Speaker, Comrade President and Deputy President, the  rapid
depreciation of the rand in the last quarter of the year was a  reminder  to
all of us that we are vulnerable in this global economy.  September  11  and
the global economic decline underscore  this  point.  As  a  result  of  the
depreciation of the rand, inflation is back. In a year in  which  there  was
limited private investment, the challenge of economic management  cannot  be
overemphasised.

It is against this background that  last  Friday's  midterm  report  by  our
President, Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki,  has  to  be  assessed.  We  have  to  ask
ourselves: To what extent have we identified the fundamental  issues  facing
the country? Has the President mapped out the most appropriate  response  to
the challenges we face? As the ANC, we answer confidently: Yes!

Not only are we up to the task, but we are in partnership  with  the  masses
of our people to solve our problems. The President's address is a report  of
consolidation of an emerging consensus in our country to eradicate  poverty,
to build our economy and to develop the most  appropriate  response  to  the
challenge of globalisation.

Many of us hear the word globalisation. We  are  aware  that  it  signals  a
major development in world affairs. It is supposed  to  affect  all  of  us,
whether we are in New York or in my own home  village  of  kwaHoyi.  We  are
presented with this reality as something given,  something  that  we  either
have to adapt to or die from. What is globalisation really? What  should  be
the response of a people's government, a  people's  movement,  to  this  new
reality?

The capitalist system has had always had the tendency to globalise.  It  has
always been  about  trade  and  interchange  beyond  the  nation-state.  The
globalisation we are referring  to  is  the  more  recent,  intensified  and
unparalleled communication, integration and exchange in the global  economy.
The actual process of globalisation has been intensifying over the  past  25
years. It is a response to the crisis  of  ungovernability,  prompted  by  a
standardising, rigid, controlling, if caring, industrialised capitalism.

It is ironic that the social crisis of ungovernability expressed  itself  at
the height  of  the  post-World  War  II  economic  boom,  when  wealth  was
genuinely shared in the capitalist centres. It  shows  that  people  do  not
just want to be well fed, they want freedom, they want their autonomy,  but,
instead of autonomy, all they get is the amorphous globalising market.

The crisis of governance coincided with the crisis of  Keynesian  economics.
For 30 years after World  War  II,  Western  governments  pursued  Keynesian
economics, in which the  state  stimulated  the  growth  of  production  and
demand  by  fiscal  and  other  measures,   redistributing   an   increasing
proportion of work that was produced, creating as many jobs  through  public
expenditure as increased productivty had eliminated in the private sector.

Improvements in productivity and the resulting expansion could no longer  be
absorbed within the nation state, owing largely to the  limits  of  domestic
markets,  hence  the  pressure  to  globalise.  Constraints   of   rigidity,
bureaucratisation and  hierarchy  caused  by  reliance  on  mass  production
increasingly became obstacles and constraints to companies. The  competitive
imperative was presented as the panacea to both the problems  of  the  state
and the problems of companies.

It  is  difficult  to  point  out  the  causal  relationship   between   the
microeconomic revolution and the need for  increased  movement  in  economic
relations. The microeconomic revolution, particularly  its  information  and
communication components, appeared as the most appropriate technique  for  a
globalising capitalism.  The  increased  knowledge  embodied  in  technology
discourages the role of labour in production,  whilst  improving  efficiency
and productivity. It has brought  about  a  major  division  within  working
people - a small core of very skilled, relatively stable  workers  amidst  a
sea of intermittent, fragile, vulnerable workers  and  unemployed.  This  is
the situation in the developed world.

It is worse in the developing world.  Based  on  productivity  improvements,
the  computer  revolution  and  the  labour-saving  methods  of  production,
globalisation has created the biggest volumes of wealth. It has  facilitated
the opening of markets and has made investments a possibility  to  the  most
distant  lands.  But  it  remains  the  most  unequal   form   of   economic
organisation and has strengthened the  power  of  business  in  relation  to
governments and peoples.

This technological transformation has strengthened global  financialisation.
Because of the computer revolution, it is  easy  for  traders  to  speculate
with national currencies.  We  live  under  the  dictatorship  of  financial
markets. This is the essential problem that lies behind the depreciation  of
the rand.

Obviously, we are not opposed to globalisation. We are only critical of  the
inequities of its present architecture. When we assumed  responsibility  for
government in the country in 1994, we had to  win  the  confidence  of  both
domestic and international business. The apartheid isolation of the  economy
had meant overprotection and an uncompetitive and  weak  economic  base.  To
respond to this, we relaxed our  tariff  regime  to  encourage  competition.
Consequently, most companies  have  been  forced  to  restructure  and  have
subsequently  improved  their  exports.  We  have  innovated  our   security
strategies to strengthen the various sectors. We have  established  a  forum
in the motor industry which has transformed an industry in decline into  one
of the major exporters in the country. We understand the central  importance
of an intervening and developmental state.

The Industrial Development Corporation continues to be the main catalyst  of
leadership and investment in the economy. Billions of rands are invested  at
an implementation stage at Ngqura and other  industrial  development  zones.
We have sought to pursue these  objectives  in  an  appropriate  fiscal  and
monetary framework. We have consciously sought to reduce inflation  as  well
as to stabilise our  fiscal  stance.  As  a  result  of  this,  as  well  as
efficiency improvements within our tax collection,  we  have  been  able  to
expand infrastructural spending and spending on  the  poor.  It  is  in  the
light of these realities that the President announced  the  plan  to  expand
the welfare net for old and young, together with a lighter  burden  of  tax,
to the working people. The planned growth summit is a nodal  point  in  this
direction.
Despite these interventions we are still  confronted  with  the  problem  of
unemployment.  We  have  to  strengthen  our  manufacturing  base.  This  is
important for job creation, even if jobs will not come in droves. This  will
give us resources to promote  sustainable  livelihoods.  We  need  money  to
catalyse  local  economic  networks.  Not  all  of  these   networks   would
necessarily be intended for the market.  They  could  just  be  about  self-
support. Alvin Toffler in his seminal book, The Third  Wave,  20  years  ago
pointed to the fact that advanced micro-electronic technologies in the  form
of alternative energy, biotechnologies and satellites,  the  increasing  use
of science in production and their easy access, make  them  appropriate  for
rural society. He called this strategy ``Gandhi with satellites''.

More recently, Frithjof Bergmann of the University of Michigan has,  through
the Future of Work Institute which works  with  the  unemployed,  discovered
that through the use of these advanced technologies, 70% of  people's  needs
can be self-addressed, even in an urban setting.

In this regard, we as the ANC welcome the announcement that  the  Government
intends to build an information and  communications  technology  university.
In the same vein, we have to raise questions about the political economy  of
research in our state research institutions.

We have to work with  the  private  sector  on  innovation  and  in  product
development. But research and innovation should not only be at  the  service
of the powerful and rich. The poor need research and science  to  solve  the
concrete life challenges that face them. In the spirit of  Vuk'uzenzele  and
Letsima, we need a mass-based science movement.

Without reducing scientists into extension officers, we need to improve  the
links between people's movements, civic organisations, NGOs,  religious  and
women's organisations as well as scientists as a  way  of  bringing  science
and technological advancement to all. We welcome and celebrate the call  for
Letsima. We have always been a movement of the people.

Only a state that encourages  mass  participation,  and  intervenes  in  the
economy, has a responsible macroeconomic stance, appreciates the  centrality
of knowledge and science, and that is committed to the poor  can  point  the
way. It is only to such a state, a movement and a society  that  the  future
belongs, and to the extent that we are such a movement and society, so  does
the future belong to us. [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, the critics of the  hon  the  President  are
wrong. He is correct. He will have no trouble at all with his  new  alliance
partner in the quadripartite alliance. There is one big  difference  between
the hon Tony Leon and the hon the President, and  that  is  that  his  gravy
train is so short. [Interjections.]

He will have no problem with the Nats about policy or ideology. We also  had
no problems about those matters with them when  they  were  using  us  as  a
lifeboat.

I hear that the hon Sakkie Pretorius and the hon Martha  Olckers  are  going
to be ambassadors. They served Vorster and P W Botha. They  were  taught  to
be loyal to their master. The President should throw them some  scraps  from
his table, and they will wag their tails at him. [Applause.]

The hon Renier Schoeman, who is  sitting  there,  adores  cocktail  parties.
Ensure that he gets invitations and he will smile at him the way  he  smiled
at the Nat government in the worst  days  of  apartheid.  He  had  no  moral
qualms then, and he will have no moral qualms now. [Interjections.] He  will
even start talking about  counter-revolutionaries  if  they  wants  him  to.
People like that never change. [Interjections.]

As for Mr Van Schalkwyk, he took money from military intelligence to spy  on
his fellow students in his student days. [Interjections.] We thought he  had
changed, but I want to tell him  that  he  never  changed.  [Interjections.]
Spying on colleagues, selective quotes, leaking from  the  caucus,  constant
briefing off-the-record, disloyalty to his leader, and  the  use  of  stolen
information all form part of his stock in trade. [Interjections.]

But his tune has changed. Six months ago, he said:


  Collective white guilt reminds me of the  repulsive  practice  of  force-
  feeding of geese to enlarge their livers to end up on a plate  as  exotic
  foie gras to be enjoyed with a glass of sweet wine.

And now he comes and stands in this House like a fat goose, ready  to  quack
whichever way he is told to. [Applause.] [Laughter.]

Last year, he laughed and criticised Tony Leon for going to Kenya. He  said,
``Tony, you don't get it - the only place that Africa  should  be  discussed
is from the comfort of Europe.'' This year, his tune has changed. He is  now
urging South Africans to support the President's  policy  on  Zimbabwe.  The
difference is that that man does  not  know  the  difference  between  self-
regard and self-respect. [Interjections.]

Mr Van Schalkwyk and Mr Marais made many changes to the Nats' team here,  in
the NCOP, and in the Western Cape parliament. What sticks out  like  a  sore
thumb is that in all those changes - dozens of  changes  -  they  could  not
find it in their hearts to introduce a single black African into  Parliament
- not one. They had 35 members in the National Assembly and  the  NCOP,  but
not a single black African. I want  to  tell  the  hon  President  that  the
important people in that party - we found out - are  still  the  P  W  Botha
organisers. He taught them a  slogan  which  read:  Slegs  blankes.  [Whites
only.] [Applause.]
They have very little remaining support and they are going to have  to  join
the ANC before the election, members know that, we know that and  they  know
that. They are going to have to compete with their loyalists for  places  on
the list and that should be an interesting fight, but  I  warn  them  to  be
careful when it comes to enrolling members. When they join the  new  African
National Congress and they start  enrolling  members  just  be  careful,  we
learned that too.

Those hon Nationalists gave South Africa apartheid, that is what  they  gave
us, and one of the worst legacies of apartheid.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr F J VAN DEVENTER: Is die agb lid bereid om 'n  vraag  te  beantwoord  oor
hulle ledelyste? [Is the hon member prepared  to  answer  a  question  about
their lists of members?]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Ongelukkig nie. [Unfortunately not.]

One of the worst legacies of apartheid is that  black  South  Africans  have
become used  to  shocking  service  and  appalling  conditions.  Instead  of
standing up for their rights, too many black South Africans are patient  and
uncomplaining. They tolerate bad treatment that  whites  would  not  put  up
with for one day. [Interjections.] Just listen to me.

The President, together with all of the rest of the people  in  this  House,
all of us in this House have to encourage our people to  realise  that  they
are free and that they, and not the bureaucrats  and  not  the  politicians,
are the real bosses of South Africa. We have to get them to go  beyond  that
legacy of apartheid.

I want to give members a few  examples.  The  Gauteng  education  department
used to have 50 000 teachers and 11 000 administrative officials. Now,  with
more children, there are  only  41  000  teachers,  but  there  are  15  000
officials. But the service has not got better, it has got worse.

Come  with  me  to  Kanana  Primary  school  in  Ivory  Park  in  my   area.
[Interjections.] The school is desperate for the  immediate  delivery  of  1
080 double desks and 1 200 chairs. These were requisitioned in  August  last
year, but the papers were lost in the department. Can they credit it?  Where
do our children sit? How do they learn  to  write  with  no  chairs  and  no
desks?

Come with me to Ebony Park, where we have no electricity,  no  sewerage,  no
water. This is in the Johannesburg Metropolitan area, it is  not  10km  away
from where the hon President had his accident the other day. Why  have  they
not been connected up? Can members imagine having  2  000  children  and  47
teachers with no lavatory  at  all  for  the  first  week  because  the  the
department of education forgot to extend the contract for  the  12  chemical
toilets. That is what we say to the parents in this country, that they  have
to put up with it and put up with it, and it is time they stop doing so.

I can take members to 10 other  schools  in  my  area  and  they  will  find
exactly the same situation and it is the job of people like me and those  in
the opposition to teach the people of South  Africa  and  to  help  them  to
recognise that they have rights as citizens, they are free  people  in  this
country and they should now stand  up  and  start  demanding  their  rights,
which people anywhere  are  entitled  to  have.  Our  people  are  tired  of
promises, poetry and nondelivery. And  we  in  the  DA  will  never  let  up
prodding and probing and presenting alternatives until either  they  improve
or they are thrown out by the voters.

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, on a  point  of  order:  In  the  course  of  his
inputs, Mr Gibson made reference to hon  members  of  the  House,  comparing
them to geese and a reference to members wagging their tails. I submit  that
is unparliamentary and I would request that he withdraw that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! That is unparliamentary, hon Gibson.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, was it  the  words  ``fat  goose''  which  I
should withdraw, or just ``goose''?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! And wagging their tails.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, oh right, and wagging their tails.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Yes. [Laughter.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I withdraw.

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, Comrade President,  Comrade  Deputy  President
and hon members, I had hoped that the hon Gibson would have  summarised  the
debate from the perspective of the DP in a solid and  considered  way.  What
we got was very unseemly, but the key themes  that  came  through  from  the
Leader of the  Opposition  were  unemployment,  poverty,  and  I  would  add
inequality,  and   growth,  but  insufficient  growth,  HIV/Aids,  violence,
particularly against women and children, crime, and Zimbabwe.

I do not think that there is anyone in this House,  least  of  all  on  this
side of the House, and I suspect everywhere, who  is  not  passionate  about
these issues, and does not recognise that these are the greatest  challenges
of our country and of our region.

Some speeches have suggested that we are just  recycling  old  debates  over
and over again. I do not think so. I tried to listen very carefully  to  all
the speakers, and I think that perceptible in the  debate  over  these  last
two days is a ground shift in the multiparty  democratic  dispensation  that
we are trying to build. It is uneven, it is not happening all  at  once,  it
is not necessarily happening in a block from  one  party  or  another,  but,
perceptibly, we saw, over the last two days, a new benchmark in the kind  of
multiparty democratic institutions that we are trying to build.

There are two fundamental ways of addressing the challenges of our  times  -
Zimbabwe, HIV/Aids, crime, growth, poverty and so forth. The one is  broadly
in  the  spirit  that  the  President  developed  on   Friday:   These   are
Government's programmes. We are doing quite well, we  are  making  progress,
but there are many difficulties. We have a 65% success  rate,  and  that  is
not good enough, but it is not a total failure.  In  order  to  succeed,  we
need to build a  broad  national  consensus.  All  South  Africans  need  to
contribute with their passions, concerns, prejudices,  and  their  fears  to
building in the spirit of Vuk'uzenzele. Many speakers took up  that  spirit,
not just from the ANC or the New NP, but from  a  range  of  other  parties,
including the DP and other parties. [Laughter.] That is one  way  of  taking
up these challenges.

Another way of taking up these challenges is to say,  ``We  told  you  so'';
``South Africa is on the brink of barbarism''; and ``We are five minutes  to
midnight, not just in  Zimbabwe,  but  here  in  South  Africa''.  For  some
people,  time  is  running  out,  and  as  for  others,  their  clocks   are
permanently stuck on five minutes to midnight.

The good news, I think, if we listen carefully to the debate, and we  should
be listening carefully to each other, however much we disagree, is that  the
Vuk'uzenzele  campaign  is  growing  and  broadening   in   its   diversity,
pluralism, outside and even inside this National Assembly. [Applause.]

A hundred and seventeen thousand years ago, a  young  woman  walked  down  a
dune at Langebaan  Lagoon  and  left  behind  three  footprints.  These  are
amongst the oldest identifiable traces of human physiognomy  that  we  have.
As the President has reminded us that  77 000  years  ago;  in  the  Blombos
cave, our great-grandparents carved out a geometric pattern on a small  slab
of ochre. These days we hear a great  deal  about  globalisation,  but  long
before the current epoch, there was an earlier wave of  globalisation.  What
is exciting  is  that  more  and  more  of  the  archeological  evidence  is
suggesting that this globalisation began here in Southern Africa. We  humans
walked down the duneside at Langebaan. We strolled over to Blombos cave,  we
ambled up through Africa, we crossed into Asia Minor and some of  us  walked
into Europe. Others wandered off into the Middle East  and  developed  great
civilisations there.  Of  course,  all  of  this  walking  was  not  in  one
direction. We went and came back. We went with one  language  in  our  mouth
and, perhaps, came back with an entirely different one in  our  mouth.  When
the climate was appropriate we crossed over the  Bering  Strait  into  North
and South America, and as we walked, we became Inuits,  Aztecs,  Mayans  and
Chinese. Identity is not locked up in origins. It is an open-ended  process,
and in a country like South Africa, above all, it has to be  an  open-ended,
progressive process. [Applause.]

Seventy-six thousand nine hundred and ninety nine years after our  ancestors
inscribed the slab of ochre, the DA was launched, and 76 999  years  and  11
months after the slab of ochre was inscribed, the  two  main  components  of
the DA split apart. I am not sure whether this 11-month alliance  registered
a bleep on the Richter scale of human civilisation. [Laughter.] But,  it  is
related to the topic that I am trying to deal with, and that is of  building
a national identity. After the DP and New NP split up and  the  announcement
of the intention of the ANC to co-operate, in some form, with the New NP,  I
was interviewed by  a  certain  radio  station.  The  journalist  was  being
mischievous,  because she was interviewing me in  my  capacity  as  an  SACP
member and she asked whether, in the light of  the  impending  co-operation,
the New NP was to the left of the DP or not? Well, I do not  know.  Frankly,
I am not very excited by the leftness of the New NP.

But that is not remotely the main point. The most salient  thing  about  the
DP is not that it is to the left or to the right of the New NP.  The  DP  is
not in the centre or  the  centre-left  or  centre-right  of  South  African
politics. It is in the  west  -  an  entirely  imaginary  west,  of  course.
[Laughter.] [Applause.] And from this position in the  west,  the  hon  Tony
Leon has developed a political project that  has  sought  to  mobilise,  not
without some success, minorities in our country on the basis of their  fears
and prejudices. [Interjections.]

The hon Seremane referred - and I  listened  carefully  to  him  -  to  hate
speech as being the way in which people speak about each other. He is  right
to be concerned about this. He should listen to what his leader  said,  just
last week, about  the  ANC  leadership.  He  said  the  ANC  leadership  are
``powermongers'', ``arrogant'',  ``corrupt'',  ``belligerent'',  ``callous''
and ``smug'', andÿ.ÿ.ÿ. ``in their  shadows'',  that  is  the  rest  of  us,
``slink an army of sycophants and gold diggers,  apologists  and  toadies.''
[Interjections.] Is that a tone  calculated  to  encourage  mutual  respect?
Does it help to build our country as a democratic space,  as  an  imbizo  in
which we debate, disagree by all means, but learn to listen to each other?

The shrillness of the hon Leon's political project is out of step  with  the
realities of our situation and more and more members here, including in  his
own party, are telling him that.

At the beginning of the 1990s there were those who proclaimed  that  history
had ended. What was supposed to have  been  the  great  organising  axis  of
world history after 1945, east yes, and west, no  longer  existed,  we  were
told. The world had become the west. However, this mood of triumphalism  has
steadily waned over the past decade. The supposed single  westernised  space
has turned out to be much more frail, much more unjust and  more  challenged
than our neoliberal ideologues imagined.

Conservative voices are now more and more beginning  to  rehash  old  themes
about east is east and west is west. In the post-September 11  situation  we
have  been  hearing  once  more  about  the  supposed  inexorable  clash  of
civilisations. It was even evoked by  some  members  of  Parliament  on  the
opposition benches. They were not alone, I should say. I  even  heard  black
journalists on the SABC say: ``We in the west  find  it  very  difficult  to
understand Islam, the Taliban or Afghanistan.'' We are not in the  west.  We
are in the south. And to say south is to evoke another  more  relevant  axis
in contemporary world history: north-south.

When one thinks of the north as the west, and not as the north,  one  starts
to forget about  three  and  a  half  centuries  of  colonialism.  When  one
conceptualises the north as Western civilisation, as enlightenment, as  free
markets and individual rights, then one might be inclined  to  imagine  that
apartheid in South Africa was merely the result of the backwardness of  some
God-forsaken Dutch tribe that had lost its way in the colonies. That is,  by
the way, how some of them talk about some of the opposition.

Apartheid and its  direct  antecedents  was  the  way  in  which  the  north
integrated this part of the  world  into  their  global  economy  -  mineral
exports  and  cheap  migrant  labour  reproduced  by   impoverished   native
reserves.  It  was  not  backwardness  that   carved   out   the   apartheid
dispensation, but the cutting edge of development in the latter half of  the
19th century. This is important to understand. We easily forget it.  It  was
vast,  new  joint  stock  companies,  deep-level  mining,  finance,  capital
mobilised on an unprecedented scale, that is what  had  laid  the  basis  of
apartheid. This path to modernisation is what made and makes us part of  the
south.

To be in the south is not to have been left behind  or  to  have  failed  to
make the walk north from Blombos cave. In the Nepad  document  and,  indeed,
in his state of the nation address, Comrade President used a small but  very
significant concept: underdevelopment. Not undeveloped,  not  backward,  nor
barbarous, not uncivilised, but underdevelopment.

Apartheid South Africa was connected to the north. It was not isolated  from
the world. It was connected to the world, like  Alexandra  is  connected  to
Sandton. The underdevelopment of the one is  the  historical  condition  for
the development of the other. It is a relationship of unequal power, but  it
is a relationship. And that relationship must not be broken, but it  has  to
be transformed. It is in the common struggle to transform this reality  that
we can and must build a national consensus.

We will all disagree about many things, and we need to  disagree  in  debate
and discussion, understanding at least that our  feet  are  planted  on  the
same ground, not in the west, but here in the south. [Applause.]

Debate interrupted.

The House adjourned at 18:21.

       Madam Speaker


       TABLING OF ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF  THE  DEPARTMENT
       FOR 2000/01


       I am writing in reply to your letter of 19 November 2001 in the above
       regard in which you pointed out that in terms of the  Public  Finance
       Management Act,  1999  (Act  1  of  1999),  the  annual  reports  and
       financial statements of departments  must  be  tabled  in  Parliament
       within six months of the end of the financial year, failing which the
       Minister must in terms of  Section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Act,  table  a
       written explanation in Parliament to give reasons why they  were  not
       tabled.


       As the Annual Report and Financial Statements of  the  Department  of
       Water Affairs and Forestry for the 2000/01 financial year  were  only
       tabled in Parliament  on  12  November  2001,  I  wish  to  offer  my
       apologies for not making the six month deadline. The reason  for  the
       late tabling of the Report and Statements is that there was  a  delay
       resulting from the Auditor-General's  approval  of  the  Department's
       accounts.


       I have taken the matter up with the Director-General:  Water  Affairs
       and Forestry and have instructed him to ensure that the  deadline  is
       complied with in future.
