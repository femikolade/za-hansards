                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I shall  move  on  behalf
of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Commonwealth Chairpersons' Committee consisting of President
           Mbeki,  President  Obasanjo  and  Prime  Minister   Howard   has
           suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth for one year;


       (b)  the issue will be revisited  in  one  year,  having  regard  for
           progress made in  Zimbabwe  based  on  the  Commonwealth  Harare
           Declaration principles, including future management of elections
           and not re-elections as we are made to believe;


       (c)  the Committee stated that land is at the core of the  crisis  in
           Zimbabwe and that the Commonwealth is ready to assist  with  the
           land issue and economic recovery; and


       (d)  the Committee has not repudiated the outcome of  the  elections;
           and


  (2) welcomes the role  played  by  President  Mbeki  in  facilitating  an
       intelligent decision which is  in  the  interest  of  the  people  of
       Zimbabwe and the Southern African region.

[Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) endorses the  decision  of  the  Commonwealth  committee  to  suspend
       Zimbabwe's membership over the flawed presidential election  in  that
       country;


  (2) notes with approval that President Thabo Mbeki, as a member  of  that
       committee, agreed that the actions of  Zanu-PF  during  the  election
       warranted this punitive step; and


  (3) recognises that the ANC's absurd view that the election was  credible
       is revealed as even more embarrassing and confused than  it  appeared
       yesterday.

[Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) compliments the Durban Organised Crime  Unit  and  Metro  Police  for
       uncovering the fraud scam dubbed the ``419 scam'' run by the Nigerian
       and Chinese businessmen and drug lords;


  (2) further gives due accolades to the said police  officers  for  having
       arrested the  masterminds  behind  this  shady  scam  in  which  five
       computers that were used to manufacture the documents  used  in  both
       the 419 and the Black Dollar scams were confiscated;


  (3) realises that this plot had only the intention to derail the  economy
       and thus enrich only its hatchers in that $2 million fake dollars,  a
       stolen luxury car, electronic equipment, 600 British pounds, hundreds
       of genuine US dollars ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Your time has expired, hon member.

Mr V B NDLOVU: Angikaqedi ukuyifunda. [I have not finished reading it.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The motion will be printed.

Mr V B NDLOVU: Hho! [Ho!]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I shall  move  on  behalf
of the ANC:


  That the House:


  (1)  notes  that  the  ANC  members  of  Parliament  and  the  provincial
       legislature in the Western Cape, councillors and over 600 members  of
       the  ANC ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Chief Whip, the procedure is  that
no one member can move two motions in the House. Can we have  somebody  else
to read that motion on behalf of the ANC?

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House:


  (1) notes that the ANC members of Parliament ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order,  hon  members!  Continue,  hon  Deputy
Chief Whip.

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Chairperson, am I protected?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: You are  protected.  Continue  and  read  the
motion.

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC members of Parliament in the national  Parliament,
       the provincial legislature in the Western Cape, councillors and  over
       600 members of the ANC  descended  on  Wallacedene  to  volunteer  to
       register all residents who qualify for social grants;


  (2) further notes that this initiative is part of the Letsema campaign of
       the ANC;


  (3) believes that the Letsema campaign has received overwhelming  support
       from the masses of our people  following  the  call  made  in  the  8
       January 2002 statement; and


  (4) applauds the initiatives made by these public representatives.

[Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf
of the New NP on the next sitting day of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the rand increased sharply after the announcement  by  the
       Commonwealth Troika, of which President Mbeki is a prominent  member,
       that Zimbabwe will be suspended for one year;


  (2) urges SADC to follow suit, given the fact that the SADC Parliamentary
       Forum observer  team  also  found  the  elections  wanting,  measured
       against their own criteria for free and fair elections; and
  (3) agrees that such a step would strengthen investor confidence  in  the
       region to the benefit of the successful implementation of Nepad.

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of the  UDM  at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that World TB Day is to be celebrated on Sunday 24 March 2002;


  (2) further notes that TB kills 2 million people per year  and  that  the
       breakdown  in  health  services,  the  spread  of  HIV/Aids  and  the
       emergence  of  multi-drug-resistant  TB  are  contributing   to   the
       worsening impact of this disease;


  (3) calls  on  Government  to  implement  comprehensive  programmes  that
       address the eradication of poverty and inequality at both country and
       global levels, noting that an investment in health is  an  investment
       in potential;


  (4)  also  calls  on  Government   to   provide   cost-effective   health
       intervention, which is widely distributed,  in  combination  with  an
       increased public awareness; and


  (5) further calls on the corporate sector, political leaders ...

[Time expired.]

Ms N S MTSWENI: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that United Nations  Secretary-General  Mr  Kofi  Anan  accused
       Israel of waging warfare against the people of Palestine;


  (2) believes that the everlasting solution to  the  Middle  East  problem
       lies in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East, and
       Israelis and Palestinians themselves should play the leading role  in
       pursuit of a negotiated settlement; and


  (3) reiterates our call for the establishment of  a  sovereign  state  of
       Palestine and the right of  the  state  of  Israel  to  exist  within
       secured borders.

[Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, hiermee gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die Vryheidsfront die besluit van  die  Statebond  dat  die  pas
           afgelope presidentsverkiesing in Zimbabwe nie vry  en  regverdig
           was nie en daarom Zimbabwe met onmiddellike effek vir 12  maande
           uit die Statebond geskors het, verwelkom;


       (b)  hierdie nie slegs as 'n strafmaatreël moet dien  nie,  maar  dat
           dit die eerste  stap  behoort  te  wees  wat  sal  lei  tot  die
           nietigverklaring van die 2002-presidentsverkiesing in  Zimbabwe;
           en


       (c)  'n nuwe verkiesing so gou as moontlik  in  Zimbabwe  gehou  moet
           word  onder  die  beheer  en  toesig  van   die   internasionale
           gemeenskap; en


  (2) na aanleiding van die  gebeure  in  Zimbabwe  en  die  internasionale
       gemeenskap se reaksie daarop, 'n beroep doen op die ANC-regering  dat
       hulle hulle nou, in belang van Suid-Afrika, vir eens en vir altyd  in
       die openbaar sal distansieer van  die  outokratiese  en  diktatoriale
       optredes van mnr Robert Mugabe.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice  that  on  the  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Freedom Front welcomes the decision by the  Commonwealth  to
           suspend Zimbabwe's membership for twelve months  with  immediate
           effect because the recent presidential elections there were  not
           free and fair;


       (b)  this should not only serve as a punitive measure,  but  that  it
           ought  to  be  the  first  step  towards  declaring   the   2002
           presidential elections in Zimbabwe null and void; and


       (c)  new elections in Zimbabwe should be held  as  soon  as  possible
           under the guidance and control of the  international  community;
           and


  (2) following on the events in Zimbabwe and the reaction to these by  the
       international community,  appeals  to  the  ANC  Government,  in  the
       interests of South Africa, to distance themselves now  once  and  for
       all publicly from the autocratic and dictatorial actions of Mr Robert
       Mugabe.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I shall move on the next sitting  day  of  the
House on behalf of the MF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a night out to party turned  into  a  tragedy  for  the  Challen
           family of Durban;
       (b)  two Saturdays ago a brawl broke out at a  Point  night  club  in
           Durban;


       (c)  what was to be a small misunderstanding resulted  in  death  and
           serious injuries; and


       (d)  according to Charmaine Challen, her husband and his brother were
           beaten by the night club's bouncers after a brawl had broken out
           in the club;


       (e)  the club owner claims that there was a fight but denies  any  of
           his bouncers being involved; and


       (f)  thus far no arrests have been made;


  (2) calls for -


       (a)  an inquest to be conducted into the death of  Neil  Challen  and
           the assault of his brother; and


       (b)  the perpetrators to be brought to justice; and


  (3) requests that urgent attention be  given  to  the  handling  of  such
       horrific occurrences.
[Applause.]

Mr K A MOLOTO: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Social Development, the hon Zola Skweyiya,
       delivered the Budget Vote speech in the House yesterday;


  (2) believes that the intention to reach out to all  eligible  recipients
       of social grants confirms the commitment of the ANC-led Government to
       roll back the frontiers of poverty; and


  (3) supports the Social Development Department Budget Vote as a practical
       step towards poverty alleviation.

[Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with dismay the fact that as  a  result  of  a  political  deal
       between the ANC and the New NP the independent post of Chairperson of
       the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has  been  promised
       to the New NP;


  (2) further notes that in democratic parliaments around  the  world,  the
       opposition chooses the chair of Scopa;


  (3) also notes that it is unheard of for a government to co-opt  a  small
       opposition party and then  pretend  that  this  will  strengthen  the
       independence of Scopa in  its  oversight  role  over  all  government
       departments and ministers; and


  (4) therefore believes that this shabby deal with the  Nationalists  will
       undermine the committee and not strengthen it.

[Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf
of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) sadly notes the tense demonstrations by the  students  of  ML  Sultan
       Technikon in Durban yesterday, as this  will  affect  their  academic
       activity;


  (2) further notes that these students disrupted the mobility  of  traffic
       and intimidated the students of the Natal Technikon as  they  charged
       at them;


  (3) recognises that these students are alleged to have been demonstrating
       against the merger of their technikon with the Natal Technikon; and


  (4) therefore calls upon everyone  concerned  to  exercise  restraint  as
       negotiations on mergers are taking place.

Mr N B FIHLA: Chair, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that incidence of rape and sodomy are  evident  in
       prison;


  (2) believes that the magnitude of the  problem  requires  all  necessary
       steps to be taken  to  ensure  that  a  positive  prison  culture  is
       fostered;


  (3) commends the Friends Against Abuse  programme  set  up  at  Pollsmoor
       Prison to address sexual exploitation and rape of prisoners;


  (4) further commends  the  Friends  Against  Abuse  Committee  for  their
       tireless work in the 14 months they have  been  active  at  Pollsmoor
       Prison; and


  (5) believes that the success  of  the  programme  is  testimony  to  the
       efforts being made by the Department of Correctional Services  to  be
       partners with the community in the  interest  of  the  community  and
       those that are entrusted to the department's care.

[Applause.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  the intention of the Department of Commerce of the United States
           Administration  to  investigate  the  complaints   of   American
           producers of canned pears that their  commercial  interests  are
           being undermined; and


       (b)  that this may adversely affect the South  African  producers  in
           respect of the preferential ad valorem duties arising  from  the
           implementation of  the  African  Growth  and  Opportunities  Act
           (AGOA); and


  (2) calls on the Minister of Trade and Industry to urgently intervene  so
       that the terms of the AGOA are strictly adhered to and that the 15,3%
       ad valorem duty in  respect  of  canned  pears  is  not  unilaterally
       removed.

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, I will move on behalf of  the  UDM  at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House, on the eve of the Easter weekend -


  (1) appeals to all road users during this long weekend to be alert at all
       times, refrain from drinking and driving, keep to the  speed  limits,
       and look out for the potential mistakes of other road users;


  (2) makes a special appeal to all pedestrians and other road users to pay
       particular  attention  to  the  rules  regarding  the   presence   of
       pedestrians on our roads, given the high rate of pedestrians that die
       every year;


  (3)  expresses  its  support  and  good  wishes  to  all  law-enforcement
       officials who will be tasked to enforce the law on our roads;


  (4) expresses its  hope  that  the  ``Arrive  Alive''  campaign  will  be
       implemented  effectively  this  year  and  wishes  the  Minister   of
       Transport and his department, and all provinces good  luck  in  their
       efforts; and


  (5) calls on all South Africans to  ensure  that  serious  accidents  and
       deaths on our roads in the coming days are kept to a minimum ...

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

                              HUMAN RIGHTS DAY
                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that tomorrow, 21 March, is Human Rights Day;


  (2) further notes that the Constitution of  South  Africa  enshrines  the
       rights of all people in our country and affirms the democratic values
       of dignity, equality and freedom;


  (3) recognises that these rights include  equality  regardless  of  race,
       gender, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social  origin,  colour,
       sexual orientation, age, disability,  religion,  conscience,  belief,
       culture,  language  and  birth,  and  that  no  person  may  unfairly
       discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more  of
       these grounds;


  (4) also notes that other rights enshrined in  the  Constitution  include
       human dignity, freedom and security of the person,  privacy,  freedom
       of religion, belief and opinion, freedom  of  expression,  and  other
       fundamental rights;


  (5) recommits itself to protecting and entrenching these rights; and


  (6) calls on all Members to promote a culture of respect for human rights
       and to work to ensure that all members of our society  are  aware  of
       and understand these rights as  well  as  their  responsibilities  to
       their fellow citizens - and to society as a whole - that emanate from
       these rights.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, I did not get a redrafted copy of that motion.  I
am not sure if I heard correctly, but I just want to  check  if  the  clause
that I discussed with  the  Chief  Whip  of  the  Majority  Party  has  been
removed. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: [Inaudible.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, if that clause has not  been  removed,  then  the
ACDP wants to register its objection.

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, on a point of order: I  need  clarity  from  you
and a ruling on the following matter. I have been under the impression  that
in terms of the Rules  of  Parliament,  motions  without  notice  should  be
unanimous and if any party disagrees  with  such  a  motion,  it  cannot  go
through on the day. I want you to please look at the Rules and then  give  a
ruling in this regard. [Interjections.]

Mr A C NEL: Chairperson,  if  I  may  address  you.  When  this  matter  was
addressed in the Chief Whips' Forum this morning, the  ADCP  indicated  that
they might have a problem with one clause. We then tried to  negotiate  with
them, but could not reach consensus.

However, we agreed that they would object to the content of the motion,  but
not to the motion being put. We discussed this matter  with  all  the  other
parties, including the DP, and there was an  agreement  that  it  should  be
done this way. If parties now want to change that, I really do not know  ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, could I give a  ruling  on
the point of order raised by Dr Mulder. The motion was moved and I  posed  a
question as to whether there was any objection. There was  no  objection  in
the first instance that the motion be moved. The hon Green then  wanted  his
objection to be recorded on that portion which he does not  agree  with.  In
other words, there was no objection to the motion being  moved.  The  motion
will then go through. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, I am a little confused by the way  you  explained
this. The ACDP objected to the content of the motion, and  I  want  to  make
that clear.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Your objection will  be  recorded.  Is
there any other motion without objection? [Laughter.]  I  am  sorry,  motion
without notice!

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, on a  further  point  of  order:  With  all  due
respect, I just need final clarity from the Chair. Do  the  Rules  therefore
make provision for a party to object to the  content  of  a  motion  without
notice, and for the motion to still be put to  the  House  and  carried?  Is
that what the Rules provide for? We need clarity,  because  we  are  talking
about a future principle here.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We will recheck  the  Rules  and  then
rule on that.

Agreed to (African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

                         GOOD WISHES FOR THE ACP-EU

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Mr Chairperson, I move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, which  convened  this  week  in
       Cape Town, was created out of a common desire to bring  together  the
       elected representatives of the European Community -  the  Members  of
       the European Parliament - and the representatives - both elected  and
       non-elected - of the African,  Caribbean  and  Pacific  states  ("ACP
       countries") that have signed the Lomé Convention and that it  is  the
       only institution of its kind in the world;


  (2) recognises that it is the only international assembly  in  which  the
       representatives of various countries sit together regularly with  the
       aim of promoting the interdependence of North and South;


  (3) acknowledges that a  substantial  part  of  the  work  of  the  Joint
       Assembly is directed towards promoting human rights and democracy and
       the  common  values  of  humanity,  and  this  has   produced   joint
       commitments undertaken within the framework of  the  UN  conferences;
       and


  (4) welcomes the ACP-EU to  Cape  Town  and  wishes  the  assembly  every
       success in achieving its goals, which will have immeasurable  benefit
       to our country, our region and the world as a whole.

Agreed to.

                VACANCY ON THE COMMISSION FOR GENDER EQUALITY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Mr Chairperson, I move  without
notice:


  That the House, in accordance with section 193(5)  of  the  Constitution,
  appoint an ad hoc committee to nominate  persons  to  fill  the  existing
  vacancy on the Commission for Gender Equality, the committee -


  (1) to consist of 27 members in the following proportions: ANC 14, DP  2,
       all other parties 1;


  (2) to exercise those powers in Rule 138 that may assist it  in  carrying
       out its task;


  (3) to take  into  consideration  the  list  of  candidates  proposed  by
       interested parties which will be referred to the committee; and


  (4) to complete its task by 24 May 2002.

Agreed to.

        APPOINTMENT OF MR M COETZEE AS DEPUTY SECRETARY TO PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  move  the  draft

  That the House, on the recommendation of the Speaker and the  Chairperson
  of the National Council of Provinces, appoints Mr  M  Coetzee  as  Deputy
  Secretary to Parliament with effect from 15 April 2002.

Agreed to.

          EXTENSION OF TRIAL-RUN PERIOD OF QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name in the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, with reference to  the  resolution  adopted  by  the  House  on  13
  November 2001, the period for the trial run of questions for  oral  reply

     COMPLETION OF TASK OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON POWERS AND PRIVILEGES OF
                                 PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:
  That, with reference to the resolution adopted by the House on 2 November
  2001, the Ad Hoc Committee on Powers and Privileges of Parliament  is  to

Agreed to.

  THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF SOUTH AFRICA IN ENGENDERING A CULTURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr G SOLOMON: Mr Chairperson ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, allow the hon  member  to
be heard, please. You may proceed, hon member.

Mr G  SOLOMON:  Chairperson,  if  there  is  a  concept  that  captures  and
epitomises the ethos of our  new  constitutional  dispensation  then  it  is
certainly the concept of  justice,  underpinned  by  a  clear  and  vigorous
concept of rights. This is the only basis  for  unifying  this  nation,  the
social fabric of which was devastated  by  the  violation  of  every  single
human right known and practised by civilised nations. This is also the  only
context for the expression of social,  economic  and  political  rights,  in
which the legal system was used as a means to deny human rights.

South Africa is unique  in  that  Chapter  2  of  the  Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996, has a justiciable Bill of  Rights
the key elements  of  which  were  born  out  of  the  liberation  struggle,
expressing the aspirations of the oppressed people  and  meeting  with  more
than internationally accepted criteria. This is the Freedom Charter  adopted
at the Congress of the People in 1955.

From the point of view of fundamental human rights, the Freedom Charter  was
amongst  the  most  advanced  documents  of  its  time.  In  simple,  clear,
understandable and coherent language  it  defends  the  fundamental,  legal,
political, cultural and civil rights of people. It  spells  out  the  social
and economic rights that were adopted by the General Assembly of the  United
Nations only in 1966, that is, a decade later.

The Freedom Charter refers to cultural  and  religious  rights,  which  were
only formulated in 1980s. The declaration on the elimination  of  all  forms
of  intolerance  and  discrimination  based  on  religion  or   belief   was
proclaimed by the General Assembly only on 25 November 1981.
Cedaw, or the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms  of  Discrimination
Against Women, was adopted by the General Assembly in  1979  and  came  into
force on 3 September 1981. This convention was preceded by three decades  by
the Federation of SA Women  which  adopted  the  Women's  Charter  in  1955,
committing the organisation to the removal of all laws  and  practices  that
discriminated against women,  and  stressing  the  dual  nature  of  women's
struggle for equality - equality with men and equality  in  the  country  of
their birth. This, indeed, was unprecedented in world history.

In celebrating Human Rights Day we need to  be  mindful  of  the  following:
firstly, the injustices and particularly the violation of  human  rights  of
the past; secondly, remember and honour  those  who  suffered  for  justice,
freedom and human rights and particularly those who sacrificed their  lives;
thirdly, reaffirm that human rights in South Africa apply to  all  who  live
in South Africa; fourthly, celebrate those rights  which  we  have  achieved
thus far; and, fifthly, continue to struggle until the  playing  fields  are
levelled as far as human rights are concerned.

The protection and propagation of the supremacy of the Constitution and  the
Bill of Rights devolve upon the community as a whole.  This  specific  task,
however, is the concern of the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development - its Minister, Deputy  Minister,  director-general,  staff  and
the portfolio and select committees. The Freedom  Charter  has  assigned  to
us, in simple language, the task to ensure that ``all shall be equal  before
the law,'' and ``that all shall enjoy human rights''.

At the practical  level,  it  is  the  task  of  the  department  to  render
accessible, fair, speedy and cost-effective the  administration  of  justice
in the interests of a safe and secure South Africa. But it is not  only  the
function of the judicial system to deal with those  who  break  the  law  by
effective investigation, prosecution and conviction.  More  importantly,  it
is also the function of the judicial  system,  through  the  courts  if  the
demand arises, to secure those social and economic rights which  are  within
the capacity of the state - to see that this is done and, if  necessary,  to
enforce it.

In order for us to be able to do  this,  it  was  necessary  to  change  the
apartheid judicial system  from  the  protector  of  white  overlordship  or
baasskap to the  protector  of  the  democratic  Constitution,  basic  human
rights and the rule of law.

It is well known that before 1994 the law enforcement agencies, the  police,
the army and the special security forces acted as agents of terror  and  not
as protectors of human rights.  These  instruments  of  domination,  besides
maintaining political power and  state  security,  also  directly  served  a
distorted economy, by keeping  the  disenfranchised  masses  under  control,
keeping them economically dependent, yes, keeping them  poor.  Unprecedented
transformation was  achieved  since  1994  with  the  establishment  of  the
Constitutional Court, a  representative  and  truly  independent  judiciary,
which includes women, a Public Protector, a Human Rights  Commission  and  a
Gender Equality Commission.

We have also  passed  through  this  House  a  large  number  of  pieces  of
legislation  impacting  upon  the  procurement  of  human  rights.   Despite
numerous challenges, the basis  is  firmly  and  permanently  laid  for  the
procurement of those basic human rights for which so  many  have  sacrificed
so much for so long. [Applause.]

Ms  M  SMUTS:  Chairperson,  the  subject  of  today  is  strangely  chosen.
Achievement is not the way I would describe  the  South  African  stance  on
human  rights  in  respect  of  the   two   great   issues   of   our   day.
[Interjections.] Aids is one of those issues. Now the  socioeconomic  rights
and their enforceability was a subject dear to the old ANC's heart  when  we
negotiated the Bill of Rights. The form that  the  enforceability  took  was
rationality  review.  Yet  on  Aids  the  Government  is  not  rational  and
therefore it is appealing against the very idea that a  court  can  exercise
rationality review.

The Human Rights Commission, which should guard  our  rights,  also  against
the Government of the day, was all set to appear as an amicus in  the  TAC's
successful rationality challenge, but it withdrew after the intervention  of
Government lawyers, because it has learnt the lesson that  it  gets  funding
and favour only when it follows the  Government's  agenda  notably  on  race
issues.

The other issue of  the  day  is  South  Africa's  stance  on  the  rape  of
democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe, the subversion of political  rights,
the destruction of free speech, the sacking of  judges  from  a  once  proud
bench, the torture. The failure of the ANC to call  these  things  by  their
name, the pretence that the election result reflects the will of the  people
has brought the question home: could  it  happen  here?  It  is  useless  to
pretend that that is not the question on people's minds  this  Human  Rights
Day.

It must be very confusing for the ANC to  be  instructed  to  vote  one  way
yesterday only to see the President assist in suspending Zimbabwe  from  the
Commonwealth in the UK later on the same day; perhaps he is as surprised  as
they are. It is futile to hope the suspension signals a change of heart  and
so the question remains: How different is South Africa  from  Zimbabwe?  The
short answer in my view is that it will be as different as we make  it.  And
that means not waiting 20  years,  like  the  Zimbabweans,  before  mounting
opposition and it means exercising the vigilance that is the  price  of  the
liberties that we have enshrined.

Now vigilance means not falling for the anticolonial and racial  blame  game
that has dominated South Africa over roughly the same period  as  the  post-
referendum  assault  on  the  Zimbabwean   opposition   in   the   name   of
anticolonialism.

Vigilance means seeing things which are the same. Now  both  the  Zimbabwean
and South African governments have introduced a strange time warp  in  their
race campaigns. President Mugabe has been attacking colonial Britain  as  if
the last 22 years never happened. Here the ghosts  of  colonial  times  very
long past were exhumed and paraded in revisionist versions  of  our  history
in a whole series of presidential speeches and pronouncements,  starting  in
1999. There was the one about Van Riebeeck's almond  hedge.  There  was  the
one about  the  virtually  genocidal  annihilation  of  the  San  which  was
ascribed to whites, whereas it  was  performed  by  black,  Khoi  and  white
pastoralists.

There were  many  such  speeches.  Apartheid  was  also  revived  and  prime
ministers like Malan attacked with such gusto  at  the  race  conference  in
2000 that one could have sworn that they were still over there  in  the  Old
Assembly Chamber, booming out the baasskap message, while in truth the  last
old National Party ruler had departed a decade earlier,  and  in  truth  the
ANC had been caucusing in the Old Assembly Chamber for a good six  years.  A
strange time warp!

I must say that the speech of  my  colleague  preceding  me  was  marked  by
something similar. He spoke as though this was still 1996.

I felt in 2000 that we had  reached  a  really  low  point  with  the  ANC's
strange,  disturbing  submission  on  media  racism  to  the  Human   Rights
Commission. Citing J M  Coetzee's  prize-winning  novel  Disgrace,  the  ANC
recounted the conversation between Lucy and her father after her rape,  when
she accepts, in  the  ANC's  description,  that  ``to  secure  her  personal
protection, she might have to marry one of her black  farmworkers  and  cede
the land to him.'' Why did  the  ANC  choose  this  passage?  On  the  ANC's
version, to illustrate that, and I quote:


  J M Coetzee makes the point that five years after our  liberation  whites
  continue to believe in a stereotype of the African as immoral and amoral,
  savage, violent, disrespectful of private  property,  driven  by  Satanic
  impulses ...

Members will recognise the litany; it appeared in many ANC and, I regret  to
say, presidential speeches, ``savage'', ``Satanic'' and so forth. Now it  is
absurd nonsense to assert such a thing, but the use of the passage did  make
the  most  ominous  political  sense  against  the  brooding  background  of
official South African silence on land invasions in Zimbabwe, as I wrote  in
April 2000. In the event, the Human  Rights  Commission's  report  on  media
racism was itself one of the really low  points  in  our  new  human  rights
history,  dealing  with  ``social  analysis''   rather   than   mere   legal
certainties, and mud-wrestling the hapless media in the slimy sediment of  a
subliminal terrain called the deep recesses of one's consciousness.

The traumatised media never analysed the report, an early danger  signal  in
itself. Now of course the hon Minister Essop Pahad is embarking on  a  media
diversity agency in the name, explicitly, of the fight  against  colonialism
of a special kind. Is it not time  that  those  hon  ANC  members  who  know
better say ``not in my name'' to statements like the  ANC  media  submission
and to the Zimbabwe election report?

I think we were doing very well in the rainbow nation South Africa. That  is
in fact when we were achieving the engendering of a human rights culture.  I
think it is unforgivable that the racial atmosphere  has  been  deliberately
soured over the last two and half years and  that  any  dissent  is  greeted
with a charge of racism.

I notice that there is a new form of insult in  this  House.  Twice  in  the
last two weeks DP members have been called Rhodesians. Neither  of  them  is
from Zimbabwe. This is a new kind of insult - ``Rhodesians''.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you rising on a  point
of order?

Mr D M GUMEDE: Yes. Chairperson, I would like  to  ask  whether  the  member
will take a question right now? [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I asked whether you were rising  on  a
point of order.

Ms M SMUTS: Sir, I regret my time  is  all  but  up  and  I  would  like  to
complete what I have to say.

Prof Laurie Schlemmer, in research before the  World  Conference  on  Racism
last year, showed that two thirds of African South Africans have not  fallen
even for their own political leader's attempts to challenge  the  legitimacy
of opposition by calling it racist. In the wake of  Zimbabwe  those  figures
will rise. It is still possible to stop the  slide  provided  one  does  not
allow the race rhetoric to mute one's opposition. We have had some  success.
We were unpopular two years ago for opposing the  Equality  Act  because  it
was unconstitutional for the Justice Minister to appoint  the  judges.  Last
year we had the great satisfaction of seeing the Ministry announce  that  it
would amend that Act. It is still possible to stop the  slide.  The  message
is  this:  South  Africa  will  be  different,  if  we  make  it  different.
[Applause.]

Ms B P SONJICA: Chairperson, I do not think that I will  waste  my  time  by
responding to the hon Dene Smuts. [Interjections.]

The President once said that South  Africa  has  two  nations:  There  is  a
privileged nation and an underprivileged one. The hon Dene Smuts,  belonging
to the privileged nation,  cannot  understand  the  achievements  that  this
particular Government has attained to engender the culture of human  rights.
[Applause.] It is only the people who come from the  underprivileged  nation
who will understand what this Government  has  achieved  to  engender  human
rights in this country.

Let me first congratulate Comrade Ronnie Kasrils on the recognition that  he
showed to 14 women for their role in  the  water  sector.  This  gesture  is
unprecedented in the world and it speaks for itself on the  achievements  of
South Africa under  this  Government  in  engendering  a  culture  of  human
rights. I was humbled to receive one of these awards along  with  our  women
veterans and activists  for  rural  development  in  the  name  of  MaTshepo
Khumbani and MaLydia Ngwenya. There is a lot  that  these  two  mothers  can
teach us about volunteerism and I congratulate them sincerely. [Applause.]

The women of South Africa, under the leadership of the Federation  of  South
African Women, made demands which they  were  to  present  at  the  people's
congress in 1955. Among these demands were the  following:  sufficient  food
for all  the  people;  reserves  to  become  food-producing  areas  and  not
reservoirs for cheap labour; indoor  sanitation,  water  supply  and  proper
lighting in homes; and equal rights for all the people of South Africa.

Although I have to confine myself to  the  right  to  sanitation  and  water
supply, I do want to say that the ANC-led Government was  so  responsive  to
these demands, which the previous regime had  violated,  that  today  women,
regardless of their race, enjoy equal opportunities. My  focus  will  be  on
the impact of water supply on the lives of people and women in particular.

In order for us to respond to the question before us we have  to  understand
water as a basic right and link it to the understanding that women's  rights
are human rights. We should also understand that lack of  access  to  clean,
potable water is a factor for underdevelopment and therefore a denial  of  a
basic human right. The lack or absence of clean, potable  water  results  in
or exacerbates poverty for obvious reasons, and women suffer  most  in  such
circumstances, a situation referred to as the feminisation of poverty.

Under the previous  regime  the  latter  was  complicated  by  a  number  of
factors: influx control, rural out-migration, etc, and the unwillingness  of
the apartheid government to develop rural areas. When it came to  water  for
rural areas, there were clear political interests that were  safeguarded  by
water policies in which access was linked to land tenure. With about 85%  of
the population having no land rights, the implications were enormous.  There
was no food security for people in the rural areas  because  the  irrigation
schemes were a monopoly of the landowners.

After 1994 the political, social and economic climate changed to create  the
best  conditions  for  the  eradication  of  poverty.  The  passing  of  the
Constitution in 1996 ensured that the rights that the  Federation  of  South
African Women had presented were secured, and access to  potable  water  was
one of those basic rights.

The Department of Water Affairs changed policies to  ensure  that  water  is
not monopolised by a few. The so-called  riparian  rights,  which  give  one
rights of access to clean  water  by  virtue  of  being  a  landowner,  were
changed to ensure that even if one were a landowner that right did not  come
automatically. Thus far, the department has delivered water to  about  seven
million  people,  creating  opportunities  for  other  activities  such   as
bricklaying, salons, etc, even for rural areas.

Today we can say that food security is guaranteed in the areas  where  there
is clean potable water. In all these activities  women  have  benefited.  We
need  to  reinforce  the  integrated  approach  to  development,  to  ensure
delivery of water so that it can have an impact on poverty. The  free  basic
water policy has benefited women,  especially  those  who  fall  within  the
poverty bracket in both urban and rural areas.

So far plus-minus 66% are benefiting from it. We commend the department  for
speeding up the process of water provision to the poor,  although  there  is
still a bigger challenge ahead.  Realising  the  equality  between  men  and
women, the jobs that the department created were  shared  between  them.  Of
the 3 397 jobs that have been created by the department plus-minus  50%  are
performed by women. There is still a great imbalance between men  and  women
at management level as a result of the lack of  skills  amongst  women.  The
department is consciously recruiting women for training to fill these  gaps.
There is clear evidence that the Government has succeeded in  engendering  a
culture of human rights. We need to understand that this is a process  which
seeks to transform society,  changing  its  patriarchal  values  and  giving
dignity to all regardless of gender. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Chairperson, we celebrate Human Rights Day  in  our  country  to
create an opportunity to ponder how much has  been  achieved  and  how  much
remains to be done. We all know that the protection of human  rights  is  an
evolving process. This celebration should indeed not  be  an  empty  ritual,
and in order to be meaningful, we must focus on the challenges we  face.  If
we merely rise today to speak about past achievements we  will  have  failed
to bring forward the eternal quest for human rights protection. We  need  to
consider  today's  and  tomorrow's  issues  rather  than  merely   rest   on
yesterday's accolades.

What  has  been  achieved  through  our  struggle  for  liberation  and  the
establishment of our democracy, and through hundreds of legislative  reforms
that we have passed in this House, is indeed a monumental  achievement  with
obviously no comparison in our history and with few in mankind's history.

However, we could make no greater mistake than believing  that  the  job  is
finished or that what we have achieved is safe from  being  threatened.  The
truth is that much needs to be done and human rights  are  now  as  much  in
jeopardy as they were, regrettably, before. The  gap  between  legality  and
reality is still very wide. To the majority of our people  the  declarations
of rights contained in our Constitution have little significance. Women  and
children continue to be abused daily in our society.  Thousands  every  year
are murdered. Millions live in fear of  their  fellow  citizens.  They  ask,
every day: Will I be robbed? Will I be raped?  Private  security  industries
are booming throughout our country.

So, we have to recognise, as we all do, that the most fundamental  right  of
them all is for a dignified life free from need and  fear.  This  right  can
only be fulfilled by  getting  our  country  into  a  much  higher  gear  of
economic growth, because we all know, too,  that  poverty  is  an  enemy  of
democracy. We need to create economic prosperity  and  social  stability  in
our communities. We all know that, especially amongst  the  poorest  of  the
poor. We are doing a lot and yet it does not seem sufficient  when  compared
to the oceans of needs confronting us.

It is remarkable that the Global Competitiveness Report,  published  by  the
World Economic Forum,  indicates  that  in  terms  of  proportional  finance
transfers from the rich to the  poor  we  come  first  among  the  countries
surveyed. We can take pride  in  this.  However,  without  further  economic
growth and employment generation, real human rights protection  will  remain
an empty promise as far as the majority of South Africans are concerned.

We must also accept that as human rights are in constant  jeopardy,  we  are
the very people who may threaten them. Our  laws  and  the  actions  of  our
Government are the primary potential sources of human rights violations.  We
need to permeate our actions with a culture of vigilance that questions  the
way we act at all times.

We use power to improve the lives of people but we must never  believe  that
anyone is beyond the possibility of abusing power. Whenever power  has  been
abused it has always been done for reasons which appeared or were  portrayed
as good reasons. We only need to reflect on Mr Robert  Mugabe's  actions  in
Zimbabwe in this regard.

In this respect I wish  to  point  out  how  my  leader,  Prince  Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, the Minister of Home Affairs, became  aware  of  the  possibility
that one of the most important reforms of this Government  could  give  rise
to an abuse of power. When launching the Hanis project, Minister  Buthelezi,
unprompted  and  unsolicited  by  anyone,  realised  that  such  a  powerful
collection of data and personal information could give rise  to  abuses  and
possible violations of the right to privacy, and he took the  initiative  to
request  Prof  Fink  Haysom  to  suggest  to  him  guidelines  or   possible
legislation to  ensure  that  under  no  condition  could  Hanis  offer  the
opportunity of turning the positive  aspects  of  social  organisation  into
abuses. [Interjections.] He did it.

We need to focus clearly on the relationship between the abuse of power  and
the economic decline of a society. Throughout  history,  whenever  power  is
abused, a civilisation begins to decline. In our context, it  is  absolutely
essential that we commit ourselves to never forgetting that  prosperity  and
democracy are inseparable. Whenever power begins to  be  abused,  prosperity
declines. We cannot use double standards. Freedom and democracy are  freedom
and democracy, and if we deserve them, everybody else has an equal right  to
them. If we begin closing an eye to violations of freedom and to attacks  on
democracy in other countries, especially when they are so close to us,  then
our own democracy is in truth weak and in jeopardy. We can say that  we  are
trying. But are we achieving? That  indeed  is  the  million-rand  question.
[Applause.]

Mr D M BAKKER: Chairperson,  tomorrow  South  Africa  will  celebrate  Human
Rights Day. In this regard it is very important for  Parliament  to  reflect
on our achievements in  establishing  a  culture  of  human  rights  in  our
country. Hopefully, this debate will also assist in advancing the  cause  of
human rights in our own country and on our continent.

Before the adoption of our interim Constitution,  the  basic  constitutional
features of our legal  framework  were  parliamentary  sovereignty  and  the
exclusion of the majority of South Africans from  representation  in  organs
of state. British colonisation of Southern Africa  since  the  beginning  of
the  19th  century  established  the  principle  that  Parliament  could  do
everything that is not naturally impossible in our country.

Parliamentary sovereignty was the constitutional instrument that  enabled  a
minority to introduce and refine  the  apartheid  system.  Any  attempts  to
assert the right of judicial review were unsuccessful.

Baie Suid-Afrikaners, en ook baie agb lede van hierdie  Huis,  is  op  grond
van ras geklassifiseer. Na aanleiding hiervan  is  hulle  onderdruk  en  aan
verskillende  gewelddadige  dade  blootgestel.  Onder  die   dekmantel   van
sogenaamde staatsveiligheid is gruweldade gepleeg  waarop  geen  regdenkende
Suid-Afrikaner trots kan wees nie. Dit is seker onmoontlik  vir  iemand  wat
dit nie self ervaar het, en  wie  se  menswaardigheid  nie  totaal  daardeur
afgebreek  is  nie,  om  ooit  werklik  te  begryp  waarvan  gepraat   word.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Many South Africans, as well as  many  hon  members  of  this  House,  were
classified according to race. As a result they were oppressed and  subjected
to various acts of violence. Under the cloak of  so-called  state  security,
atrocities were committed that no right-minded South African  can  be  proud
of. It is probably impossible for someone who did not  experience  this  him
or herself, and whose human dignity was not completely broken down by  this,
to ever truly comprehend what is being talked about.]

Against this  background,  we  have  started  the  process  of  healing  and
eliminating the divisions of our past. The overwhelming  majority  of  South
Africans,  across  the  racial  and  political  divide,  opted  for  a   new
constitutional order, premised on an open and democratic government and  the
universal enjoyment of fundamental rights.

Today we have  an  outstanding  Constitution,  including  a  Bill  of  Human
Rights, which every South African can be proud of.

Our Constitution is based on values that underlie  an  open  and  democratic
society and the concept of ubuntu. This concept  was  described  by  Justice
Langa as follows, and I quote:


  It  recognises  a  person's  status  as  a  human  being,   entitled   to
  unconditional respect, dignity, value and acceptance from members of  the
  community that such a person happens to be part of.

Die daarstelling van 'n menseregtekultuur in Suid-Afrika het werklik  beslag
gekry met die aanvaarding  van  ons  Grondwet  en  die  instelling  van  die
Konstitusionele Hof. Met inagneming van buitelandse  reg,  die  volkereg  en
die waardes wat 'n oop en demokratiese samelewing  bevorder,  het  ons  howe
inhoud begin gee aan die regte wat in die Grondwet gewaarborg word.

Die uitsprake van ons Konstitusionele Hof en ander howe  maak  dit  duidelik
dat 'n individu nooit gereduseer mag word tot 'n  blote  objek  waaroor  mag
uitgeoefen word nie. Menswaardigheid moet gerespekteer word,  en  die  staat
mag slegs in die lewe van die individu inmeng as dit noodsaaklik is vir  die
handhawing van 'n ordelike samelewing. (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The establishment of a human rights  culture  in  South  Africa  was  truly
settled with the adoption of our Constitution and the establishment  of  the
Constitutional Court. In consideration of  foreign  law,  international  law
and the values that promote an open and democratic society, our courts  have
begun to give content to the rights guaranteed in the Constitution.

The verdicts of our Constitutional Court and other courts  indicate  clearly
that an individual may never be reduced to a mere object  over  which  power
is exerted. Human  dignity  must  be  respected,  and  the  state  may  only
intervene in the life of  the  individual  if  this  is  necessary  for  the
maintenance of an orderly society.]

In a short period of time since 1994 we have made  substantial  progress  in
developing a truly South African jurisprudence.  We  can  be  proud  of  our
achievements, but we cannot afford to forget our past. The link between  our
history concerning human rights abuses and the adoption of the  Constitution
should always be uppermost in our minds. It is  the  responsibility  of  all
South Africans to acknowledge and to nurture the culture of human rights.

In this regard, the attitude of  politicians  and  their  guidance  will  be
decisive in the advancement of a human  rights  culture.  Our  actions,  our
efforts and our support should never undermine our proclaimed commitment  to
upholding  human  rights.  If  the  people  of  Zimbabwe  are   intimidated,
repressed and victimised by agents of their own government, it is  our  duty
as neighbours and as fellow men and women to do everything in our  power  to
assist in the restoration of human dignity in Zimbabwe. We cannot allow  any
individual to blatantly disregard that dignity.

In conclusion, let us acknowledge our achievements since 1994. Let us  build
on our successes as a country where democratic ideals are not  merely  words
on paper. Our advancement in the cause of human rights  will,  in  years  to
come, determine whether we have succeeded in entrenching real human  dignity
for all South Africans. [Applause.]

Rev A D GOOSEN: Chairperson, I will be concentrating on  matters  pertaining
to local government. It is significant that this debate is taking  place  on
the eve of Human Rights Day, because this  is  the  ideal  time  for  taking
stock of what we have achieved in terms of the Bill of Rights.

In Genesis we read that, ``Man has been created in the  image  and  likeness
of God'' and in Genesis there is a strong emphasis on the  dignity  of  man.
This notion is echoed in section 10 of the Bill of Rights which states  that
``Everyone has  inherent  dignity  and  the  right  to  have  their  dignity
respected and protected.''

Our past history reveals that the dignity of  one  section  of  society  was
trampled upon by the infringement of their human rights. This is clear  from
the conditions under which people had to live. A peek into our history  will
reveal that people were subjected to terrible hardships in  their  areas  of
residence.

The urban poor are living on the periphery, which in many  instances  is  no
less than three kilometres out of town. In these areas all  the  roads  were
corrugated. There was a gross lack of services such as water. People had  to
queue for water at a communal tap. The bucket system was used and  this  was
largely degrading to people. The streets were all untarred  and  muddy  when
it rained. The townships were pitch dark at night, and, because of the  lack
of electricity, women had to walk long  distances  every  day  in  order  to
gather wood to keep the home fires burning.

Barring the  lack  of  services,  the  nonexistence  of  infrastructure  was
evidenced by the absence of a stormwater system,  proper  housing,  clinics,
crèches, community halls, sports fields, hospitals and  shopping  complexes.
The lack of all these facilities constitutes  a  serious  violation  of  the
rights of people, because these rights were withheld on purpose.

The  picture  changed  dramatically  with  the  heralding  in  of  the   new
dispensation when the ANC was elected into  Government  in  1994.  With  the
assistance of both the provincial  and  local  government  spheres,  central
Government systematically set about  addressing  the  urgent  needs  of  the
people throughout the country, so as to bring about  relief  and  to  change
their lives for better.  Those  of  us  who  worked  in  these  areas  could
actually see the changes which were being brought about.

The transformation which took place was most heartening. A person could  see
that gradually the face of the townships was changing dramatically with  the
improvement of the infrastructure. Allow me to expand on how  we  sought  to
eradicate  at  least  some  of  these  difficulties  which  people  had   to
experience on a daily basis. Previously  people  were  living  in  darkness.
Their  lives  were  literally  lit  up  by  the  electrification  of   their
residential areas. Can members imagine what it means for people who  had  to
walk to church by means of candlelight now, all of a sudden, to have  lights
on the streets? Can members imagine what it means  for  people  who  had  to
walk three kilometres to town to make a telephone call,  or  for  those  who
are living in rural areas, kilometres apart, to get telephones  and  now  to
be in close contact with their families and friends?

In many instances the bucket system has been replaced by a  decent  sewerage
system. This has gone a long way in restoring the dignity  of  residents  in
the townships. Where previously patients had to walk long distances  to  get
to a clinic, we now have a situation where  clinics  have  been  erected  in
most of these residential areas.

When water was brought onto their premises, people  were  most  appreciative
of having access to this much-sought-after commodity. Access  roads  to  our
townships have been tarred and people are also appreciative of this.

Through the initiative of Government, houses  were  built,  community  halls
were erected, crèches came into being, sports fields were built  and  people
were given access to land. Thanks to  the  communal  property  associations,
people and communities can now access land. One  such  trust  exists  in  my
constituency, the Illima Properties  Association.  These  people  are  doing
well. A further 26 hectares of land were handed over to the community on  17
December 2001.

These achievements are shining examples of what Government  has  done  in  a
short space of time. Those who see these attainments  as  insignificant  are
those who reside in the leafy suburbs of town and who  never  knew  what  it
meant to be deprived of the essential things in life. Besides, they are  the
ones who can never begin to imagine the hardships that people  have  had  to
face all their lives.

These changes are especially of great value to our  womenfolk.  It  restored
their dignity because no person  should  be  of  less  value  than  another.
Instead of carrying a bundle of wood on the head, the ladies can now  switch
the stove on to cook  a  decent  meal  for  their  loved  ones.  Instead  of
lighting a candle, a woman can switch on the light. She has more time for  a
host of other things and can even take time to further  her  education.  The
ANC Government has gone a long way in the emancipation of women.

Whereas local government was previously limited to the towns and cities,  we
now have a wall-to-wall government system which gives people  the  right  to
decide their own future, and to mandate their Government.

For struggling people, especially women  in  rural  areas,  this  is  indeed
great  progress,  because  the  entire  country  is  now  covered  by  local
government systems which need to be implemented by the  central  Government.
[Time Expired.] [Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, the pre-1994 period is laden with  a  tragic  and
long history of numerous incidents of state-sanctioned  gross  human  rights
violations. The doctrine of  parliamentary  sovereignty  led  to  systematic
violations of the rule  of  law  and  gross  state-sanctioned  human  rights
violations. Therefore, on the eve of Human Rights Day, we  need  to  reflect
on our country's achievements and shortcomings.

Whilst we have made many strides in a variety of fields, we have  still  not
been able to fully restore the rights of our women, our children and,  to  a
degree, our disabled. We cannot, as men, claim to be  liberated  unless  the
human rights of our women, children and disabled are restored.

At the child abuse hearings  last  week,  horror  tales  unfolded  when  our
children spoke out. The possibilities have been documented and we  need  now
to map out the way forward. Laws alone are not  the  solution.  We  need  to
change the psyche of our society and develop  a  caring  culture  where  the
protectors remain exactly that and do not turn into  the  perpetrators,  who
must be ostracised and isolated.

Whilst we celebrate steady progress in human rights, we are saddened by  the
rapid erosion thereof in other parts of the world, for  example  the  Middle
East, the United States and, even  closer  to  home,  Zimbabwe.  I  wish  to
address these unambiguously  and  without  fear.  The  United  States,  that
bastion of democracy, the  big  brother  policing  other  nations  on  human
rights  issues,  in  its  foray  into  Afghanistan,  burnt  the   proverbial
haystack,  but  never   found   the   needle,   destroying   the   country's
infrastructure, rendering thousands homeless and robbing thousands  more  of
their dreams, aspirations and human rights by killing indiscriminately.

Captured fighters are currently incarcerated at  Guantánamo  Bay  under  the
most abhorrent conditions imaginable. In the aftermath of 11  September,  an
abhorrent event where civilians were robbed of their right to  life,  anyone
resembling an Arab in the  United  States  was  discriminated  against,  and
hundreds are still incarcerated in  prisons,  reminiscent  of  the  180-days
detentions during the heyday of apartheid. The  United  States  constitution
reads and I quote: ``Every citizen is entitled  to  life,  liberty  and  the
pursuit of happiness.'' You be the judge! Are  those  incarcerated  enjoying
any of that?

In the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  has  intensified,  and
again thousands have been robbed of  their  dreams  and  human  rights.  The
Economist of 2 February 2002 reports as follows, and I quote:


  The Bush  administration  has  pounded  vigorously  on  Mr  Arafat,  Vice
  President Dick Cheney all but calling him a liar. But the  Americans  are
  not dealing with Mr Arafat. They are letting Israel bleed  him  until  he
  aggressively roots out the infrastructure of the  terrorist  organisation
  in Palestine and arrests those known to plan or support such acts.

I conclude by saying: Ask not for whom the bell tolls; it  tolls  for  thee.
[Time expired.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that huge strides  have  been
made  in  South  Africa  generally,  and  in  our   human   rights   culture
particularly,  when  it  comes  to  the  removal  of   racial   and   gender
discrimination.
At the same time, however, when one  considers  various  reports  that  have
been tabled in Parliament, one realises that much still has to  be  done  to
promote God-given human rights, particularly when it comes to  abused  women
and children. Yesterday's debate on the interim report on the  sexual  abuse
of children has highlighted a dismal record in the protection of children.

In so far as offences against women and children are concerned, we  need  to
continually emphasise a victim-centred approach to  criminal  justice.  Only
by exposing the trauma experienced by victims of crime,  as  was  done  this
week, can we begin to understand the  extent  of  this  violation  of  human
rights. Clearly, we are far from cultivating a human rights culture in  this
regard. We need to cry out to God in confession and repentance  for  failing
our abused women and children.

Whilst the ACDP applauds the attention given to the plight  of  such  abused
women and children, this phenomenon is a symptom of a  much  deeper  malaise
in our society. We speak about  the  need  for  moral  regeneration  in  our
society, but we are basically reaping what we have sown. As God  does  exist
and does create law, any society that ignores His laws does so  at  its  own
peril.

Without a culture of God-given human rights and biblically-based  laws  that
are worthy of obedience, no amount of moral regeneration can take place,  as
there is no frame of reference at the outset. Man quickly realises  that  if
he accepts that God does not exist or that God's law  can  be  ignored,  all
things become permissible and one is faced with situational ethics.

Whilst legal positivists have no criterion for judging  the  appropriateness
of a law other than man's perceived needs, the Christian can and must  refer
to the divine law as his basis for declaring a law just or unjust,  and  for
engendering a culture of God-given human rights.

Ms O R KASIENYANE: Madam Speaker and hon members, the best of our  political
dispensation brought with it the hope for the poorest  of  the  poor.  Built
into that was the hope that their human rights  as  human  beings  would  be
restored.

Today we can look back  and  proudly  say  that  we  have  not  reached  the
promised land, but we are at the mountain top, from  where  we  can  clearly
see our promised land. These are some of the sentiments which  I  have  come
across while visiting some of our rural areas.

It is true that, for the first time, no African child  has  to  suffer  from
malnutrition or lose his or her life at a tender  age  because  his  or  her
parents are unemployed, thanks to the policy of our  Government  to  provide
grants in such circumstances. It is true that the grants might not meet  all
the expectations, but to our people it is like manna  from  heaven,  because
they know that Rome was not built in one day.

Nothing is more heart-rending than when one is old and feels  that  one  has
no rights because no one seems to care for one. The rights of the  aged,  as
espoused by our policies, have given hope to our senior citizens.  They  can
now walk tall and, like our former President said, they can  soon  even  die
with a smile on their faces because this ANC-led Government  has  proven  to
them that their rights will be protected at all costs.

Historically, services to older persons were rendered mainly in urban  areas
to a minority, and generally consisted of institutional care.  As  in  other
parts of  the  world,  the  management  of  aging  in  South  Africa  is  of
importance  to  the  Government.  Of  particular  concern  is  the  lack  of
appropriate and affordable services for frail, destitute  older  persons  in
disadvantaged and rural communities.

To address  these  issues,  a  new  dispensation  has  been  introduced.  It
incorporates an appropriate and affordable community-based service with  the
family as the core support system; the principle that  older  people  should
live at home or in communities for as long as possible; the promotion of  an
age-integrated society where older people are regarded  as  full  and  equal
citizens; and the viewpoint  that  older  people  are  a  valuable  pool  of
knowledge, expertise, skills and wisdom.

From its formation, the ANC has always been a movement  for  the  liberation
of all the people of Africa, including South  Africa.  It  has  always  seen
itself as fighting for the human dignity of  all  Africans.  Loyal  to  this
human rights and patriotic tradition, the ANC is  convinced  that  the  time
has come for Africa to take its rightful place among the world's nations  in
pursuit of human rights for African men,  women  and  children.  Afrika,  ke
nako. [Africa, now is the time.] [Applause.]

In November 1998, the Government's  economic,  social  and  justice  sectors
committed themselves to SADC's declaration on  the  prevention  of  violence
against  women  and  children,  signed  in  Mauritius  in   September.   The
commitment was made at a national conference held in Pretoria  to  mark  the
beginning of a series of actions aimed at redressing violence against  women
and children and popularising the declaration.

These actions culminated in the celebration of the 50th anniversary  of  the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights held in Johannesburg on  10  December.
On this day the Government  launched  its  national  action  plan  on  human
rights.

These milestones achieved for African children  are,  however,  not  without
birth pangs, for the violation of these rights  under  the  previous  regime
for more than 300 years had already polarised our society. Hence  the  abuse
of these rights by children who undermine their parents and the  feeling  of
despair  and  helplessness  among  parents  who  do   not   understand   the
implications of such rights for them and their children. Our main task as  a
country is  therefore  to  educate  the  masses  and  ensure  that  what  we
struggled for for so long was not pursued in vain. The question is:  Is  the
Human Rights  Commission  well  equipped  and  capacitated  to  fulfil  this
mammoth task?

The status  of  rural  women  married  under  customary  laws  has  recently
changed. Previously only civil and  Christian  marriages  were  accepted  as
legitimate. We are proud today that the Recognition of  Customary  Marriages
Act is in place. The Constitution of our country is unique in  its  specific
provisions for gender equality, affirmative action, freedom and security  of
person and socioeconomic rights and in the provision that customary  law  is
subject to the Bill of Rights.

There are many cases of hidden discrimination. These form critical  barriers
to the achievement of substantive  equality.  For  example,  while  men  and
women are, in theory, equally  eligible  for  government  housing  and  land
schemes, men are still the major  beneficiaries  because  such  schemes  are
registered in their names.

Violence against women and  children  is  the  most  pervasive  and  serious
violation of human rights in the world  today.  That  is  why  we  are  here
today, committed to working actively to put an end to it. Let  us  keep  the
spirit of  sacrifice  and  dedication.  Let  us  concretise  the  notion  of
volunteerism within ourselves. The  human  mind  must  be  made  aware  that
anyone who witnesses acts of violence must report them to the police.  These
women and children, victims of violation and harassment, need  long  periods
of psychological therapy.

As members of Parliament, we can and must play a  crucial  role  as  a  link
between Government and civil society  if  the  promotion  of  human  rights,
democratisation and good governance is to succeed.

We have been elected not to enrich ourselves,  but  to  help  the  poor  and
marginalised in our society. In doing so, we can become truly rich.  We  can
only be honourable by making  ourselves  honourable  and  dignified  through
democracy.  As  equal  partners   in   development,   we   will   contribute
substantially to the realisation of these aims and objectives.

I am able and proud to tell the story of our country's contribution  to  the
evolution of earth, life, humanity and  human  society.  This  calls  for  a
celebration of our rich history and heritage. Indeed, the  values  contained
in the Freedon  Charter  should  inspire  all  of  us  to  cultivate  a  new
patriotism based on a sense of community, respect for the dignity  of  every
individual and a shared destiny.

I am a volunteer, and in order  to  ensure  a  better  life  for  all  South
Africans, so can and should fellow hon members be. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mev die Speaker, daar word groot gewag gemaak deur veral  die
ANC dat Suid-Afrika die beste en  modernste  grondwet  in  die  wêreld  het.
Vroeër vanjaar het die agb Minister van Waterwese en Bosbou juis in  hierdie
Huis oor die onderwerp in vervoering geraak. Feit van  die  saak  is  egter:
Daar is geen ding soos 'n finale grondwet  nie,  en  tweedens,  die  huidige
Grondwet is nie die modernste en beste grondwet in die wêreld  nie.  Om  die
waarheid te sê, die Grondwet is in verskeie wesenlike  aspekte  fundamenteel
gebrekkig. Alhoewel  daar  met  die  huidige  Grondwet  'n  belangrike  stap
vorentoe gegee is met die daarstelling van 'n Handves van Regte het die  tyd
nou aangebreek dat die volgende  tree  gegee  word  met  die  erkenning  van
minderheidsregte vir die verskillende  gemeenskappe  in  Suid-Afrika  as  'n
logiese uitbreiding van die huidige individuele regte. Die bekende  filosoof
Johann Roussouw skryf onlangs in Die Taalgenoot hieroor die volgende:


  Die  enigste  konstante  is  verandering  en  daarom  moet  ons   onsself
  voortdurend afvra: Wat is politiek in 'n veranderende wêreld? Politiek is
  die gevolg van die ontmoeting tussen die  verskillende  belange  van  ons
  alledaagse leefwêreld, en omdat hierdie belange  meervoudig  is,  is  die
  politiek 'n deurlopende poging om hierdie belange op 'n skeppende wyse in
  'n ewewig te probeer bring.
In homogene gemeenskappe is individuele regte voldoende  om  hierdie  ewewig
te verseker, maar in 'n diverse gemeenskap soos Suid-Afrika  is  dit  alleen
ongelukkig  nie  voldoende   nie.   Minderheidsregte   staan   nie   teenoor
individuele  menseregte  nie,  maar  is  juis  'n  logiese  uitbreiding  van
individuele regte, veral in 'n diverse en verdeelde samelewing soos wat  ons
in Suid-Afrika het. Die tyd het gekom dat ons  hierdie  logiese  stap  neem,
dan en eers dan sal ons dalk daarvan kan begin praat dat ons  die  modernste
grondwet in die  wêreld  het.  Tot  dan  is  dit  nog  lank  nie  daar  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, a great deal of reference is made by the  ANC
in particular to the fact that South Africa has the  best  and  most  modern
constitution in the world. Earlier this year the hon the Minister  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry went into raptures in this House about  precisely  this
subject. However, the fact of the matter is: There is no  such  thing  as  a
final constitution, and secondly, the current Constitution is not  the  most
modern  and  best  constitution  in  the  world.  To  tell  the  truth,  the
Constitution is fundamentally flawed in various essential aspects.  Although
an important step forward was taken with the current Constitution  with  the
establishment of a Bill of Rights, the time has now come that the next  step
be  taken  with  the  recognition  of  minority  rights  for   the   various
communities  in  South  Africa  as  a  logical  extension  of  the   current
individual rights.  The  well-known  philosopher  Johann  Roussouw  recently
wrote the following about this matter in Die  Taalgenoot:


  Die  enigste  konstante  is  verandering  en  daarom  moet  ons   onsself
  voortdurend afvra: Wat is politiek in 'n veranderende wêreld? Politiek is
  die gevolg van die ontmoeting tussen die  verskillende  belange  van  ons
  alledaagse leefwêreld, en omdat hierdie belange  meervoudig  is,  is  die
  politiek 'n deurlopende poging om hierdie belange op 'n skeppende wyse in
  'n ewewig te probeer bring.

In homogeneous communities individual rights are sufficient to  ensure  this
balance, but in a diverse community like South Africa this  on  its  own  is
unfortunately not sufficient. Minority  rights  are  not  in  opposition  to
individual  human  rights,  but  are  precisely  a  logical   extension   of
individual rights, particularly in a diverse and divided society as we  have
in South Africa. The time has come for us to take this  logical  step;  then
and only then can we perhaps begin talking  about  having  the  most  modern
constitution in the world. Until then that is by far not the case.]
Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, as a people of this part of  the  globe,  we
have to be thankful that we are heirs  of  a  never-say-die  and  undaunting
determination of the men and women who met at  the  World  Trade  Centre  to
negotiate a settlement for this country. It is the same  negotiations  which
brought to light the fact that brains, not brawn, is what matters.

Those negotiations gave birth to the culture of human rights.  Human  rights
are based on respect for dignity, and they are based on  the  philosophy  of
live and  let  live.  Any  conduct  that  involves  committing  murder,  and
engaging in violent activities and the abuse of  children,  is  inconsistent
with respect for human rights.

Through Acts of Parliament, the Government has shown resolve in  inculcating
a culture of human rights. The abolition of capital punishment has been  one
way of demonstrating this resolve. The equality of all people  as  contained
in section 9 of the Constitution is non-negotiable. It is clear that no  one
may be unfairly discriminated against on grounds of race, colour, ethnic  or
social origin, sex, religion or language.

To this end, Parliament has passed the Promotion of Equality and  Prevention
of Unfair Discrimination Act of 2000. However,  the  Act  has  unfortunately
not been implemented and enforced in its entirety due to  a  lack  of  human
and financial resources. One wonders, why go to such lengths and then  leave
the Act to gather dust? It is surely an indication  of  poor  planning  that
will result in failure.

We should also be at pains to inculcate a spirit  of  self-worth  among  our
people. Each person has to know that they were not created with  the  crumbs
of soil that fell from the Master's table and clay as He made other  people.
We have to imbue our people with the knowledge that each  one  is  somebody.
We call on all people to direct their energies to  the  foundational  values
of our Constitution, namely the rule of law, dignity, equality and  freedom,
which are the bedrock on which to build the future.

The Chapter 9 institutions in our Constitution have been  put  in  place  to
serve as checks  and  balances  for  the  man  in  the  street.  They  enjoy
independence and may be accessed without any bureaucratic constraints.

Finally, may we plead that all measures meant to  enhance  human  rights  be
enforced. We should  not  have  a  situation  like  the  one  in  which  the
Commissioner of Police is  on  record  as  having  said  that  the  Domestic
Violence  Act  is  unenforceable.  It  is  unfortunate  that  we  have  such
situations.

[Mr S PHOHLELA: Honourable Chairperson  and  everybody  in  this  honourable
House, yesterday during the debate concerning the report  presented  by  the
Whip of this House, regarding the  issue  of  Zimbabwe,  I  felt  very  much
perturbed when I recalled  that  those  rebels  are  people  whose  domestic
affairs are still bound to be placed in order here in the country.]

I will dedicate this speech to those farm  labourers  who  still  experience
the hardships of life on this land.

[Getting to the human rights issue, I  would  like  to  put  it  clearly  by
quoting. You say: ``We have been abused for a very long  time,  so  much  so
that we get even frightened on hearing a  car  passing  by  in  the  street,
especially at night. The white person who came  along  with  the  doctor  is
called Tjhuki and he is John Vosloo's colleague who snatched twenty-five  of
our cattle and who has corralled them  since  the  year  2000  at  a  placed
called Senekal, from where they have since disappeared.'' Even today,  those
people have not yet received back their cattle.

It was in 1997 that I stood here, thoroughly explaining the  troubles  which
our people on the farms are going through - explaining the manner  in  which
these poor, cold-blooded people are determined to ignore all the  laws  that
are being implemented by this House, and to pursue the  way  in  which  they
were taught regarding the manner in which a black person should be  treated.
Such people are still here and are living in this  country.  Before  we  can
start accusing countries such as Zimbabwe,  whenever  we  talk  about  human
rights, we first need to assess and analyse our own domestic affairs.

There is a very critical factor with which we have not yet dealt  in  depth.
That is spiritual harassment. We have not  yet  dealt  in  depth  with  this
factor. We are concentrating on physical  violence,  which  concerns  bodily
harm. That is what we are concentrating on. But the  cruel  thing  which  is
the actual source of physical harassment is spiritual violence.  Our  people
are constantly being harassed, stripped of their possessions and kicked  off
the farms. They are being harassed in every possible manner. They are  being
denied access to water supply, they are being denied access to roadways  and
children are being hindered from attending schools. Therefore, I would  like
to point out that we have  not  yet  reached  the  stage  at  which  we  can
confidently claim that we are satisfied as  regards  the  implementation  of
human rights in this country.

It is the same people whom we call boers in this country. But I  don't  mean
all of them. I am talking about my  colleagues  in  the  Free  State.  I  am
talking about that place near Paul Roux, Senekal and Bethlehem. It has  been
a long time now since I have talked about those people  who  are  living  on
the farms having been brutally harassed. We told them to  remain  there  and
we went and met those farmers, who told us  a  whole  lot  of  evil  things.
Those people are really evil individuals who brutally swear at people.  They
are not even afraid to swear at the  government  leaders  of  this  country.
They told us without any fear - me and my delegates from the  department  of
agriculture in the Free State Province - that they  don't  care  about  what
the government is busy doing, and that it is their country. Even today,  the
process is still continuing. These letters that I am  reading  here  arrived
here on Monday. I asked for them because I wanted to be up  to  date  as  to
what is currently happening.

I would like to challenge this House. Your honour, I want to challenge  you,
that just as you instituted a commission that went to assess  the  situation
in Zimbabwe, we also need a multiparty commission which  will  accompany  us
to the farms so that they can hear for themselves  by  asking  those  people
questions as to why our people are being so brutally harassed. [Applause.]]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC calls 21 March Sharpeville  Day,  the
United Nations declared it the international  day  for  the  elimination  of
racial discrimination, and in this country it is called  Human  Rights  Day.
There would be no 21 March in the history of the world and of this  country,
observed by the United Nations and South  Africa,  if  the  brave  sons  and
daughters of our country never heeded the PAC's call that inhuman pass  laws
must go.

When launching the positive  action  campaign  against  the  pass  laws  the
founding president of the PAC, Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, said:


  I need not list the arguments against the pass laws.  Their  effects  are
  well known.  All  the  evidence  of  broken  homes,  the  oppression  and
  degradation of the African, lead to one conclusion, that  the  pass  laws
  must go. We cannot remain foreigners  in  our  country.  If  the  African
  people are asked to disperse, they will do so orderly and  quietly.  They
  have instructions from me to do so, but we will  not  run  away.  If  the
  other side so desires, we  will  provide  them  with  an  opportunity  to
  demonstrate to the world how brutal they can be. We are ready to die  for
  our cause, we are not yet ready to kill for it.

The  historic  revolutionary  action  by  the   PAC   on   21   March   1960
internationalised the vile system of apartheid. For the first time ever  the
Security Council, the supreme body of the United  Nations,  discussed  South
Africa in the anticolonial  context.  The  Broederbond,  the  think-tank  of
apartheid, was shaken to its foundation. Afrikaners such as the  Rev  Beyers
Naudé resigned from the Broederbond.

When commemorating 21 March, the historic role of the PAC on  that  day  and
the African martyrs who fell in Sharpeville and  Langa  must  be  truthfully
recorded.  Through  the  historic  campaign   the   PAC   contributed   many
conventions to international law,  the  most  important  of  which  was  the
international Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the  Crime  of
Apartheid. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, it is certain that the introduction  of  the
Bill of Rights, and the recognition of the institution of human  rights  and
equality, were hard for many to adjust to.  But  the  MF  congratulates  all
South  Africans  on  the  unanimous  turnaround  from  a  racially   divided
citizenry to a people's society, where all are free, fair and equal.

It is just a few years since our first democratic  election,  in  comparison
to years of inhuman oppression, but look at us now! Together in  one  House,
working in unison for the betterment of all South Africans!

We have crossed the social divide. The MF  applauds  all  parties  who  have
shown an untainted commitment to making this democracy work. The reason  for
upholding human rights is not just that the Constitution reigns supreme  and
the law demands that it should be  upheld,  but  rather  because  we  are  a
people's government. We are also  the  people,  and  human  rights  are  the
central issue that makes us a people's government.

The many projects  and  initiatives  and  the  variety  of  contributors  to
programmes concerning human rights, even the  task  team  on  the  abuse  of
children, are examples of that culture of human rights  that  has  built  us
into  the  nation  we  are  today:  the  rainbow  nation,  with  a  people's
government that works hard at  protecting,  enhancing  and  promoting  human
rights in all our work. The MF is proud to  be  part  of  this  culture  for
human rights. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, may I bring something to the attention  of  this
House and of the HRC? It is this booklet from  the  HRC  called  My  Rights,
Your Rights. The very first chapter, the  Bill  of  Rights,  starts  with  a
picture that I wish to show to the House. A man is standing  on  a  mountain
holding two stone tablets, rays of sunlight shining upon him.  Clearly  this
resembles  Moses  on  Mount  Sinai  holding  the  two  tablets  of  the  Ten
Commandments of God in his hands.  We  cannot  accept  this.  The  intrinsic
message is that our Bill of Rights is the new,  real  Ten  Commandments  and
replaces the proclaimed will of God. This is blasphemous.

The AEB is going to take this up with the HRC. Let us hope that  they  react
positively,  otherwise  they  will  have  to  handle  a  complaint   against
themselves.

On paper South  Africa  has  nearly  everything  in  place  with  regard  to
individual human rights: the Bill of Rights entrenched in the  Constitution,
the Human Rights Commission and the Promotion of Equality and Prevention  of
Unfair Discrimination Act.

Ek wil egter in die minuut wat ek oor het, net twee sake noem wat die  regte
van Suid-Afrikaners bedreig. Net gisteraand ontvang ek van 'n dosent met  'n
doktorsgraad 'n e-pos met die volgende woorde:


  Ek verwag binnekort my afdanking, wanneer UniQwa by die UVS geïnkorporeer
  word. Emigrasie en toekomsloosheid vul my onderbewuste elke dag. Ek is 45
  en 'n WHAM - White Afrikaner Male.  Al  die  wonderlike  gepraat  beteken
  niks. Sonder inkomste kan ek niks doen nie. My gesin  sien  geen  sin  in
  betrokkenheid by landsake nie as ek nie eens die lewensmiddele vir  hulle
  kan voorsien nie.

Regstellende aksie is wel deel  van  die  Handves,  maar  daar  moet  vandag
besluit word of my briefskrywer opgewonde kan voel oor menseregte  in  Suid-
Afrika. Ek kan die voorbeeld met duisende vermenigvuldig.

Die tweede saak is misdaad. In  teorie  het  ek  die  reg  tot  vryheid  van
beweging en in praktyk is ons strate  na  sononder  'n  ``no-go  area''.  In
teorie het ek die reg op lewe en in die praktyk is een uit elke 40 boere  in
Suid-Afrika die afgelope tien  jaar  vermoor.  Kom  ons  spreek  misdaad  en
onregstellende aksie aan. Dan praat ons  weer  van  ``human  rights''.  [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[However, in the minute left to me I want to mention  two  issues  that  are
threatening the rights of South Africans. Just yesterday evening I  received
an E-mail from a lecturer with a doctor's degree, which read:


  Ek verwag binnekort my afdanking, wanneer UniQwa by die UVS geïnkorporeer
  word. Emigrasie en toekomsloosheid vul my onderbewuste elke dag. Ek is 45
  en 'n WHAM - White Afrikaner Male.  Al  die  wonderlike  gepraat  beteken
  niks. Sonder inkomste kan ek niks doen nie. My gesin  sien  geen  sin  in
  betrokkenheid by landsake nie as ek nie eens die lewensmiddele vir  hulle
  kan voorsien nie.

Affirmative action may form part of the Bill, but a decision must  be  taken
today on whether my correspondent should be excited about  human  rights  in
South Africa. I can multiply this example by thousands.

The second issue is crime.  In  theory  I  have  the  right  to  freedom  of
movement, and in practice our streets are  no-go  areas  after  sundown.  In
theory I have the right to life, and in practice one out of very 40  farmers
in South Africa was murdered over the past ten years. Let us  address  crime
and ``onregstellende aksie''  [un-affirmative  action].  Then  we  can  talk
about human rights again. [Time expired.]]

The SPEAKER: I will also have to look at that book. I am not sure it is  not
also sexist. [Interjections.]

Mr L P M NZIMANDE: Madam Speaker, one is tempted to respond to The hon  Dene
Smuts, but we have to continue with the business at  hand.  [Interjections.]
We are participating  in  this  parliamentary  debate  today,  during  Human
Rights Month, in order to  make  a  contribution  to  the  celebrations  and
commemorations of the national Human Rights Day. As a people we must  indeed
note the achievements we have made thus far  in  engendering  a  culture  of
human rights in all of the societal spheres, but not with complacency  or  a
failure to acknowledge the gaps and weaknesses in  our  efforts  to  promote
human rights.

As a nation we rise to build a South  Africa  that  is  radically  different
from the one that emerged a century ago: a  nation  that  was  ravaged  with
racial  divisions   systematically   codified,   sanctified   and,   indeed,
ruthlessly implemented.

The  system  of  apartheid  carried  with   it   social   injustices   which
impoverished the majority of the citizens, engendering a patriarchal  system
that sexually  discriminated  against  and  dominated  women  citizens,  and
produced state institutions that did not  care  for  the  human  rights  and
dignity of our people, to mention but a few of the ills that plagued  people
and continue to haunt us today in our endeavours to ensure that the  culture
of human rights  is  inculcated  amongst  ourselves  as  human  beings  and,
indeed, within the institutions that we use  as  instruments  for  achieving
our goals of a society that is free from racism, sexism and  discrimination,
a society that cares.

In the centre of all is the ill of the  marginalisation  of  the  vulnerable
groups, namely, children, youth, the disabled and the elderly.  A  society's
generosity in its response to the needs of those in it  who  are  vulnerable
is central to the delivery of a better life.

Therefore the society must have yardsticks through which it measures  itself
by its responses to those needs. A call  was  made  on  the  people  by  the
President to rise and act in  the  spirit  of  volunteerism,  ensuring  that
there is social equity for all  and,  I  quote,  ``that  we  accelerate  and
entrench the forward march of women's emancipation in  all  spheres  of  our
lives''

We also need to reflect as a nation on whether  we  are  indeed  making  the
necessary progress  in  advancing  the  constitutional  rights  of  disabled
people. As we are heeding the call of  Vukuzenzele  we  must  guard  against
those in our society  that  would  selfishly  create  barriers  against  the
majority accessing opportunities that  are  created  by  our  democracy  and
would even stand in the way  of  the  enjoyment  and  realisation  of  human
rights by all.

The ushering in of the new democracy in 1994 and the struggles that  led  to
the current dispensation brought with them expectations of an  enjoyment  of
human rights that are central to service  delivery  and  the  needs  of  our
people. This poses  a  challenge  to  us  regarding  our  goals  of  service
delivery, to guarantee the accelerated speed which our  programmes  need  to
meet their objectives and increase access to those who still do not have.

In the middle of all efforts seeking solutions to the questions  of  service
delivery,  namely  inaccessibility  and  the  slow  pace,  are  notably  the
milestones made in the progress of our human rights entrenchment  strategies
with guarantees accompanying them. Let me highlight a  few.  These  include,
amongst  many,  the  freedoms  of  security,  opinion,  speech,  expression,
language, culture, assembly, movement and political activity. An  individual
has the right to choose freely his or her  place  of  residence  and  to  be
treated and protected equally by law.

There is the right to life, to  respect  for  and  the  promotion  of  one's
dignity, to have judicial disputes settled by a court,  to  have  access  to
all information held by the state in order to exercise one's  rights,  to  a
healthy environment, to a basic education and to be taught, where  possible,
in one's own language.

Indeed, the choice is that of  the  people  and  those  who  lead  them.  We
further note those instruments that  are  put  in  place  to  guard  against
violations, and the legislation programme that further assists  in  crafting
a democracy that cares for its people, through  the  Promotion  of  Equality
and Prevention of Unfair  Discrimination  Act,  the  draft  Bill  on  sexual
offences and the Bill on child justice, to name but a few that the House  is
aware of. There  is  also  the  youth  development  policy,  that  has  been
approved by Cabinet.

For marginalised groups the realisation of human rights  is  the  foundation
for the full attainment and enjoyment of  their  rights.  The  institutional
infrastructure to roll out programmes for the youth, children  and  disabled
people needs to continue to ensure that there is proper  co-ordination  that
seeks to enhance delivery to  them.  Thus  we  welcome  the  national  youth
development policy, attempts to deal with widespread  child  abuse  and  the
announcement by the Minister of Social Development yesterday of  a  plan  to
establish a review of services to children with disabilities  in  the  rural
areas.

Furthermore, we acknowledge and welcome the  President's  pronouncements  on
the need for Government to allocate the necessary resources in  the  current
medium-expenditure  period,  ensuring  that  Public  Works  speeds  up   the
provision of resources for massive renovation  programmes  and  projects  in
our schools, clinics, hospitals and  other  amenities  across  the  country.
This mission should be based on the  values  of  the  Constitution  and  the
Government's policies on reconstruction and development.

Democracy and equality should be the cornerstone of the values  we  seek  to
espouse. For disabled  people,  justice  will  be  attained  when  there  is
reasonable  access  to  existing  infrastructure,  as  contemplated  in  the
promotion of equality legislation of 2002. They  require  devices  from  the
public health system and development work on sign language. Indeed, for  the
youth skills development strategies are currently in place. We also  welcome
the fact that the board of the Umsobomvu Fund has placed adverts  for  youth
organisations to apply for at least R150 million to start to  alleviate  the
plight that our youth is facing out there. These adverts  invite  previously
disadvantaged youth to apply to the  Umsobomvu  Fund,  in  order  to  access
resources to  reach  their  full  potential  as  citizens.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, hon members, I speak on behalf  of
the Government, and that is why I have a speech written  by  the  Department
of Justice and Constitutional Development. But it is too late  now  to  read
the speech  to  hon  members.  I  appear  on  behalf  of  the  line-function
Minister, the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development.

I arrived back from Amsterdam this afternoon at 13:00, and found that I  was
expected to close the debate on this very  important  day.  It  is  a  great
pleasure to do so, although I feel I should be in bed by now,  judging  from
what I went through yesterday.

We are in fact dealing with two matters here. We are not only  dealing  with
the achievement of our country  in  developing  and  engendering  the  whole
notion  of  a  culture  in  human  rights,  but  also,   tomorrow   we   are
commemorating  the  International  Day  for  the   Elimination   of   Racial
Discrimination, as we have been reminded by Mr Pheko, who  is  unfortunately
not here at the moment. We fought very hard for the United  Nations  to  put
this on their agenda.
I say this because a few days ago there were local government  elections  in
Rotterdam, which I suppose is the second largest city  in  the  Netherlands,
and a chauvinist bigot  became  a  member  of  the  largest  party.  In  the
national elections that will be held in May, he may  become  the  leader  of
the third largest party in the Netherlands. I  have  always  considered  the
Netherlands to be a very humane and generous  place,  but  in  this  month's
election campaign the codeword was one which  one  finds  in  most  European
countries,  ``anti-immigration  policy''.  An  anti-immigration  policy   is
basically a racist policy. There is no other way to describe it.  The  Dutch
were ashamed that this could happen  60  years  after  the  overthrowing  of
Nazism and their own occupation. They said  they  looked  forward  to  South
Africa giving a meaningful response to political leadership as to  how  they
could deal with this situation and  avert  the  possibility  of  chauvinists
coming into important positions of power, running  this  extraordinary  city
and possibly coming into a coalition government.

I regret to say that Dene Smuts is not here. I will not say that I will  not
answer her, because I would like to answer what she said. I would  ask  her:
Does she ever feel sometimes that she could be  wrong?  Does  she  not  feel
that by not giving the larger picture  of  what  happened  here,  about  our
genuine achievements, she is actually selling South Africa  short?  A  great
friend of the opposition is a man called  Kenny  who  writes  for  both  the
Citizen and the Spectator, a very influential right-wing journal.  The  last
time he wrote he said: ``The position of the black in South Africa is  worse
than it was in the time of colonialism.''

Anybody could write that. And, of course,  the  Spectator  does  not  always
answer replies, I regret to say. But anybody who could say that is not  only
selling our country short, but is really betraying the remarkable  gains  we
have genuinely achieved. And that is dangerous  for  democracy!  [Applause.]
To mock democracy in this way plays into the hands of  demagogues  who  want
to rewrite history, as we heard about this.

The second point to remember is that we are  trying  to  make  our  days  as
inclusive  as  possible.  That  is  an  important  point  -  Mr   Pheko   is
unfortunately not here -  because  on  this  day  we  also  commemorate  the
extraordinary loss of women, black and white,  in  the  concentration  camps
between 1899 and 1902. We heard for the first  time  about  landlessness  in
that moving book by Sol Plaatje, A Native Life in South Africa.  People  had
no sense of belonging! Millions of people  became  wanderers  in  their  own
country. The result  was  the  total  destruction  of  social  organisation,
because if one denies people a sense of belonging, one denies them  a  sense
of nationality, and one denies them a basis for  common  citizenship,  which
is what in fact we have been trying to engender.

If Dene Smuts was here I would say that I spoke to the old  DP  -  I  sought
special permission  to  go  into  their  lunch  room  -  about  proportional
representation.   They   did   not   know   anything   about    proportional
representation and single party lists in 1991 and 1992.

If we did not have this single party list, Mr Pheko would not come with  his
revisions of history and a poem  on  rewriting  history,  as  we  find  here
today. [Applause.] A poem on rewriting history! He would not be here. He  is
from a 1% party. Most of the democrats would not  be  here  either,  because
everybody supported first past the posts. [Interjections.]  I  remember  the
SABC asking poor Dada Sisulu when he  came  out  of  Robben  Island,  nogal,
``What kind of electoral system would you like, Mr  Sisulu?''  He  had  just
come out of Robben Island! And Mr Sisulu said, Well, you know, ``first  past
the posts has served the whites very well, so it is good enough for us.''

If we had first past the posts, which could  have  been  imposed,  it  would
have first of all entailed juggling with the constituencies.  Secondly,  the
choice of candidates would not have  resulted  in  women  being  candidates.
That is the general history everywhere  in  the  world  of  first  past  the
posts. But the worst thing would have been an alliance between two  parties,
two parties who would have carved up the whole of South Africa. There  would
be no third and fourth parties and independents.

So we have someone here who got 50 000 votes, and  he  sits  in  Parliament.
[Interjections.] Another who got 75 000 votes  sits  here.  [Interjections.]
The fact is that the electoral system, the  top  constitutional  order,  was
proposed by us - the Constitutional Court - when we held a workshop.

Now I do not say these things out of any vainglory. But to say that in  fact
the Government ... or, to use the words which Ms Vos should be  ashamed  of,
that human rights are still in jeopardy as they were in the apartheid  days,
is to minimise what we have as a social  compact.  The  important  thing  is
that we arranged the social compact with each other. That was a  fundamental
triumph that no one can take away  from  us.  [Interjections.]  It  was  ...
Please! The hon member was not around then.
We, the lawyers in the ANC, were asked in 1988 to draft a  constitution  for
South Africa. We said that we could  not  draft  a  constitution  for  South
Africa in the ANC, as a negotiating gambit. We said that this was the  right
of the people of South Africa to draft a constitution. [Applause.]

So we drafted the principles of the constitution, which became the basis  of
the Harare Declaration, and which became the basis of negotiation.  And  for
the first time we drew not on the preamble to the  Freedom  Charter  only  -
that South Africa belongs to all those who live in it,  black  and  white  -
which  is  the  most  fundamental  repudiation  of  racism  and   acceptable
coexistence that I know of anywhere in the world. We went back further,  and
this is a tradition that I am very proud of as a lawyer, where  in  1943  we
drew up the African Claims Document. With the typical lack of  arrogance  of
the ANC we sent this document to Churchill and Roosevelt.  [Laughter.]  This
shows the  degree  of  humility  in  the  ANC  that  we  sent  it  to  them.
[Applause.]

However, the important thing is that this is a precocious document.  It  had
social and economic rights long before the universal  declaration  was  even
identified.  In  1943  this  document  talked  about  the  bill  of  rights,
citizenship,  commerce,   education,   industry   and   labour,   land   and
discrimination.
I commend  this  extraordinary  first  bill  of  rights  by  any  liberation
movement anywhere in the world. That is what we  come  from.  We  come  from
that background. If Dene Smuts  had  been  here  -  and  I  say  this  in  a
comradely way - she would have looked at the rich  history.  Of  course  one
can find fault. Of course errors were made; enormous errors were made.

On the other  hand,  much  of  our  legislation,  including  legislation  on
affirmative action, but certainly the National Water Act, as I learned  over
the weekend  too  ...  The  National  Water  Act,  they  say,  is  the  most
enlightened,  progressive  piece  of  water  legislation.  I  say  this  for
Afrikaner farmers too, by the way, because more  water  is  made  available.
That is the important thing. They said it was the most progressive piece  of
legislation anywhere in the world.  These  were  young  people  who  crafted
this, as part of the human rights dimension.

Can I end by saying, very quickly, that we are not in the worst position  of
all. We are not going to be  self-congratulatory  or  self-indulgent.  There
are vulnerable groups we must talk about. This is still about racism.  There
are central things, like gender discrimination, immigrants, the  disabled  -
as Comrade  Nzimande  rightly  said  -  the  rights  of  persons  living  in
traditional societies, particularly women, refugees.
I know of Guantánamo Bay where people's beards are cut off.  Do  not  forget
that the most dehumanising thing is to affect the religious  association  of
prisoners. [Interjections.] Please do not  throw  that  out  as  a  kind  of
ejaculation. There are other forms of ejaculations too! [Laughter.]

We also have to look at  the  question  of  genetic  engineering  and  human
rights. A very important issue is  the  responsibility  of  science  in  the
context of human  rights  and  the  genome.  And  of  course  poverty  is  a
fundamental violation of all human rights.

There are other areas of which we are very proud.  By  the  way,  I  do  not
believe  that  the  Constitution  is  an  obstacle  to  the  prosecution  of
criminals. I do not  believe  that  the  Constitution  has  rendered  social
rights a dead letter. I support the Grootboom case. I support the idea  that
these are rights which are recognisable in a court of law. It is the  limits
of judicial intervention that matter.

In the same way, I think that we should talk about the right to life. It  is
very odd that those who oppose  abortion  legislation,  which  supports  the
right of a woman to choose, are the most zealous  in  wanting  to  chop  off
heads, to execute people. [Laughter.]
We celebrate the fact that we can finally debate these  matters.  It  is  an
enormous thing that we are able to debate these matters. We  can  do  so  in
this House and in our country, because the fundamental purpose  of  this  is
to strengthen our whole body politic.

A former United Nations Secretary-General said, and I quote:


  One thing is certain: there can be no sustainable development ...

We are going to use this later -


  ... without prioritising democracy.

Respect for fundamental human rights can only be  clearly  established  when
we strengthen the whole democratic framework in all its forms.  I  am  proud
to be associated with this Government, with this Parliament  and  with  this
extraordinary  place  called  South  Africa  on  this  Human   Rights   Day.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, we will provide the Minister  for  Justice
and Constitutional Affairs with the Hansard of this speech, and  trust  that
he will approve.
Debate concluded.
