Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the  DA  lost  control  of  Stellenbosch  Municipality  on
       Tuesday, 15 October 2002;


  (2) believes that the crossing of the DA councillors in Stellenbosch is a
       victory for democracy, nonracialism, nation-building and development;


  (3) welcomes the councillors who left the DA and believes that this  will
       help to restore stability and integrity of governance in the  Western
       Cape; and


  (4) looks forward to the people of Stellenbosch hosting ANC delegates who
       will be attending the 51st conference;

Maatla! All power to the people! And a lesson to the DP: Do not  count  your
chickens before they are hatched. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC's path to power is littered with broken  promises,
       including those  to  the  IFP  prior  to  the  1994  elections  about
       international mediation, and to the FF about a volkstaat;


  (2) further notes that the New NP is basing its betrayal of the voters on
       a promise from the ANC of seats in national and provincial  cabinets,
       ambassadorships and well-paid jobs at various levels; and


  (3) warns the New NP that the ANC is using them to gain  total  power  at
       every level of government and that they will  get  few  jobs  and  no
       influence in return.

[Interjections.]
Prof H NGUBANE: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Warrant Officer Magriet Strydom has become the first woman
       to carry the senior flag of the South African Navy;


  (2) further notes that this flag is paraded at  all  important  occasions
       where the Chief of the Navy is officiating and  also  when  the  navy
       participates in parades with all  the  arms  of  service  of  the  SA
       National Defence Force (SANDF) every two years; and


  (3) congratulates Warrant Officer Strydom on her achievement.

Ms S H NTOMBELA: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the ANC-led Government embarked on an Imbizo focus week on 7  to
           13 October under the theme ``Lend a hand to  protect  children's
           rights''; and


       (b)  people's representatives in all  spheres  of  government  joined
           hands with public servants to  register  all  children  who  are
           eligible for child support grants and other forms of assistance;


  (2) believes that the Imbizo programmes reflect the commitment of the ANC-
       led  Government  to  ensure  ongoing  and  dynamic  dialogue   around
       government programmes aimed at creating a better life for all;


  (3) believes that the massive mobilisation for registration  of  eligible
       children for social grants reflects the  commitment  of  the  ANC  to
       uphold children's rights to a brighter future  and  to  fighting  the
       scourge of poverty; and


  (4)  commends  the  ANC  Government  for  embarking  on  this   important
       programme. [Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with utter disgust that DA chief whip of the  Ekurhuleni  Metro
       Caucus, Malcolm Lennox, instructed the immediate removal  of  several
       councillors as representatives on portfolio committees;


  (2) further notes that his actions are not only against the ruling of the
       Constitutional Court ordering that no councillor may  be  denied  any
       rights and privileges attached to his or her membership, but are also
       in direct contrast with the Constitutional Amendment Act, which in no
       uncertain terms states that no party may perform any  act  whatsoever
       which may cause such a councillor to  be  disqualified  from  holding
       office as such a councillor in that Council, without the  consent  of
       the councillor concerned; and


  (3) condemns in the strongest possible terms the  deplorable  actions  of
       this DA chief whip  and  calls  on  the  relevant  metro  council  to
       institute  disciplinary  action  against  him  for  contravening  the
       Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

[Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock the  latest  horror  research  findings  that  rural
       poverty in the Western Cape, one of the richest provinces, is in fact
       much higher than expected;


  (2) further notes that researchers found that many  households  in  Ceres
       lived on less than R100  a  month,  and  that  these  findings  point
       towards the truly horrific scale  of  rural  poverty  throughout  the
       country;


  (3) agrees that these findings are a staggering indictment of the various
       political rulers in the Western Cape who, for these past  two  years,
       have  engaged  non-stop  in  the  politics  of   self-promotion   and
       pettiness, and continue to do so even  now  at  the  expense  of  the
       people of the Western Cape; and


  (4) calls upon the national Government to  admit  that  its  policies  to
       create jobs and curb poverty have failed, and to implement  policies,
       including a food parcel or stamp system, that will benefit all  South
       Africans and not just a small elite associated  with  the  ANC  gravy
       train.
Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the ANC's commitment to fighting poverty, ensuring food security
           and building a better life for all; and


       (b)  that escalating food prices are affecting poor communities in  a
           negative manner;


  (2) further notes the announcement by Government to -


       (a)  subsidise special maize meal to the tune of R20 per 12,5kg;


       (b)  increase old-age pensions, child  support  grants,  foster  care
           grants and care dependency grants;
       (c)  intensify the campaign to register eligible citizens for  social
           grants; and


       (d)  monitor food prices and enhance the school nutrition programme;


  (3) believes that this represents the ANC's commitment to food  security,
       especially for the poorest of the poor, and fighting poverty; and


  (4) welcomes the announcements made by  the  Government  to  ensure  that
       people are protected from impoverishment and  the  vicious  cycle  of
       poverty.

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes  the  decision  of  the  Constitutional  Court  that  upheld
       legislation which illegalises brothels and prostitution;


  (2) notes that our Constitution does not recognise a right to be abused;


  (3) notes that brothel owners are pretending to be fighting  for  women's
       rights when in fact they are the  ones  who  are  treating  women  as
       commodities to be exploited for pleasure and financial gain;


  (4) notes that the decision  will  help  the  state  to  curb  girl-child
       trafficking; and


  (5) hails the decision as a victory in the fight for  the  protection  of
       girl children, women's rights, family values and moral regeneration.

volgende sittingsdag van die Huis namens die FA sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  dat die statistiek van  Interpol  aantoon  dat  Suid-Afrika  die
           moord-hoofstad van die wêreld is, met 52 485 moorde  of  pogings
           tot moord, met Venezuela tweede met net 8 022  moordgevalle  per
           jaar; en


       (b)  dat dit beteken dat daar in Suid-Afrika 143 moorde  of  verwante
           gevalle plaasgevind het elke dag, oftewel een  geval  elke  tien

       Sekuriteit verklaar het dat hy tevrede is dat die misdaadvlak in Suid-
       Afrika gestabiliseer het; en


  (3) 'n beroep op die Regering doen om die konstitusionele verpligting  om
       Suid-Afrikaners teen geweld te  beskerm,  na  te  kom  deur  aan  die
       polisie die nodige fondse te verskaf om die plig te volvoer.

       (b)  that this means that in South  Africa  143  murders  or  related
           incidents took place  every  day,  or  one  incident  every  ten
           minutes;


  (2) notes with alarm that the Minister of Safety and Security has  stated

       responsibility  of  protecting  South  Africans  against  crime,   by
       providing the police with the necessary funds to fulfil its duty.]

           and


  (2) calls on the  Government  to  take  urgent  steps  to  improve  South

  (3) also notes  that  a  high-ranking  Home  Affairs  official  has  been

       addressed; and

  (5) calls on young women to emulate this shining example.

[Applause.]

volgende sittingsdag van die Huis namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  sekere plaaslike owerhede belasting op landbougrond eensydig  en
           te hoog hef; en

  (3) kennis neem dat die Nuwe NP 'n dringende beroep op die Regering  doen

(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr S SIMMONS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)   certain  local   authorities   levy   agricultural   land   tax
           unilaterally and excessively; and


       (b)  last month the Appeal Court found the introduction of  such  tax
           without  the  necessary  valuations  to  be  ``unreasonable  and
           discriminatory";

       Johan Gelderblom, that a moratorium be placed on the introduction  of
       land tax in the Western Cape until such time as a national summit  is

       just introduction and levying of land tax; and


  (3) notes that  the  New  NP  urgently  appeals  to  the  Government,  in
       collaboration with the  relevant  role-players,  to  introduce  clear
       guidelines and a uniform national policy in respect of  land  tax  as
       soon as possible.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) learns with disgust that the Minister  of  Safety  and  Security  has
       agreed to pay an amount of R2,25  million  to  the  trustees  of  the
       Harksen estate;


  (2) condemns unreservedly the fact that South African taxpayers  have  to
       foot the bill for what is either a blatant fabrication by a convicted
       fraudster,  or  sheer  incompetence  by  the  police,  regarding  the
       existence and  supposed  theft  of  money  from  a  gymnasium  locker
       belonging to Mr Harksen;


  (3) further notes that Mr  Harksen  has  succeeded  in  embarrassing  and
       tainting the names of several parties in this House, and has  further
       succeeded in making a mockery of this Government and  this  country's
       courts; and


  (4) calls upon the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development  to
       immediately fast-track the  long  overdue  and  thoroughly  justified
       extradition of Mr Harksen.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the

   PROMOTION OF EQUALITY AND PREVENTION OF UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT
   BILL, PROMOTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE AMENDMENT BILL, PROMOTION OF
  ACCESS TO INFORMATION AMENDMENT BILL AND INSOLVENCY SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Speaker, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, and comrades, I will  be  dealing
with four pieces of legislation during this  input,  and  while  that  might
sound complicated, it is, in essence, quite a simple procedure.

To begin, the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair  Discrimination
Amendment Bill amends sections 16 and 31 of the principal Act in respect  of
the designation of presiding officers of the equality  courts,  training  as
it pertains to presiding officers for purposes of the Equality Act, and  the
establishment  of  equality  courts  at  magistrates'  courts   level.   The
promulgation of this amendment will facilitate the  implementation  of  this
very important piece of legislation, and it is to be welcomed.

Clause 1 of the Equality Bill substitutes section 16 of  the  Equality  Act,
which at present provides that  every  High  Court  and  every  magistrates'
court is an equality court for the area of its jurisdiction.

The practical effect of this is that, at the magisterial court  level,  such
a  court  may  only  hear  cases   arising   within   its   geographic   and
jurisdictional limits. These courts  are  therefore  unable  to  convene  as
equality courts in cases that, for instance,  do  not  arise  in  their  own
magisterial districts.  The  Justice  Department  has  therefore  faced  the
challenge of ensuring that every magistrates' court  is  fully  equipped  to
operate as an equality court at the date of implementation of chapter  4  of
the Equality Act, and all  this  within  the  constraints  of  an  extremely
limited resource  base.  Constraints  in  respect  of  equipment  and  other
infrastructure were aggravated  by  the  fact  that,  in  many  magistrates'
courts,  there  is  a  shortage  of  suitable  courtrooms,  and  despite  an
extensive programme of subject-specific training, there  still  exist  areas
that lack the appropriate levels of capacity to effectively  implement  this
legislation at both the clerk of the court level, as well as  the  presiding
officer level.

An incremental approach to the implementation  of  equality  courts  at  the
magistrates' court level was thus essential to the effective  implementation
of this legislation. We also need to  do  this  in  a  way  that  strikes  a
balance between addressing the demand for a sufficient  number  of  equality
courts and managing the resource constraints that continue  to  be  a  stark
reality in the day-to-day operations of our courts. To achieve this, and  in
order to facilitate  the  implementation  of  chapter  4  of  the  Act,  the
relevant provisions of section 16 had to be revised.

As far as equality courts at High Court level are concerned,  the  provision
that every High Court is an equality court for the area of its  jurisdiction
is left unchanged. The amendment to this section  allows  for  one  or  more
magistrates' courts in an administrative  region  to  be  designated  as  an
equality court. This decision now only occurs after  consultation  with  the
head of  the  relevant  administrative  region.  The  jurisdiction  of  each
equality court will be defined very carefully, and in that process, we  hope
to achieve an acceptable spread  of  equality  courts  at  the  magistrates'
court level. We will be able to  establish  these  courts  as  soon  as  the
relevant sections of the Equality Act become operational.
As far as presiding officers are concerned, new provisions dictate that  any
additional magistrate and/or judge may, by reason of his  or  her  training,
experience, expertise and suitability in the field  of  equality  and  human
rights, be designated as a  presiding  officer  of  an  equality  court.  In
addition, the Cabinet member responsible for the administration  of  justice
designates  the  presiding  officers  after  consultation  with  the   Judge
President or head of an administrative region.

As we all know, objections have been raised that sections 16 and 31 of  this
legislation infringe upon the independence of the judiciary,  and  upon  the
principle of separation of powers.

During a meeting between the heads  of  courts  and  the  Ministry,  it  was
agreed that the Act should be amended so that the designation  of  presiding
officers should be left to the heads of courts. The amendment thus  provides
that only a judge, magistrate or additional magistrate who has  completed  a
training course  as  a  presiding  officer  of  an  equality  court  may  be
designated as such - a presiding officer. This designation will  become  the
responsibility of the Judge President or  the  head  of  the  administrative
region, as the case may be.

Another important feature contained  in  the  Bill  is  that  the  Director-
General must keep a  list  of  every  judge,  magistrate  and/or  additional
magistrate who has completed the relevant training or  has  been  designated
as a presiding officer of an equality court. This  requirement  ensures  the
existence of  a  single  database  that  captures  the  particulars  of  all
appropriately capacitated  presiding  officers  for  the  purposes  of  this
legislation.

The section relating to the clerks of the equality courts in  the  amendment
deals with two aspects.  Firstly,  the  Director-General  may  only  appoint
persons or designated officials of the department  who  have  completed  the
appropriate training modules as clerks of  the  equality  courts.  Secondly,
the Director-General must compile and maintain a database of the  names  and
particulars of those persons and officials who have completed the  necessary
training, and those who have been appointed or designated as clerks  of  the
equality courts.

The Bill places the obligation  to  develop  the  content  of  the  training
courses upon the chief justice who must  do  so  in  consultation  with  the
Judicial Service Commission and the  Magistrates  Commission.  The  relevant
subsection is  unambiguous  in  that  it  confers  upon  the  judiciary  the
responsibility to determine the content of the  relevant  training  courses,
so as to avoid any interpretation that there  might  occur  an  infringement
upon judicial independence.

This legislation now makes it clear that the role of  the  Cabinet  Minister
responsible for the administration of justice is  to  ensure  financial  and
logistical  support  in  respect  of  training  for  the  purposes  of  this
legislation. That, in short,  deals  with  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and
Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Amendment Bill.

It  is  now  necessary  for  me  to  refer  briefly  to  the  Promotion   of
Administrative Justice Amendment Bill. The term `court', as it  pertains  to
the principal Act, is defined as a magistrates' court, either  generally  or
in respect of a specified class of administrative actions designated by  the
Minister via notice in the Gazette. A similar  definition  is  contained  in
the Promotion of Access to Information  Act.  The  relevant  definitions  in
this Act that  relate  to  the  designation  of  judicial  officers  by  the
Minister were subject to the  same  criticisms  as  those  directed  at  the
designation  of  judges,  magistrates  and  additional  magistrates  in  the
Equality Act.

Clause 1 of this amendment, which must be read in  conjunction  with  clause
2, amends the definition of court so as to address this objection.  The  new
provision in clause 2 gives the head of an administrative region  the  power
to designate a magistrate ot additional  magistrates  for  the  purposes  of
presiding  in  court  proceedings,  as  contemplated  in   the   Act.   Only
magistrates or additional magistrates who  have  received  training  may  be
designated as presiding officers. The content of the training  courses  will
again be developed by the judiciary  in  a  similar  fashion  as  previously
described in the equality amendment. Again,  the  chief  justice  determines
the content and implementation of the training modules required.

Here again, the role of the executive is limited to ensuring that  financial
and logistical support is made available  in  respect  of  implementing  the
necessary training.

The provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Amendment Bill  are
identical to those of the  Promotion  of  Administrative  Justice  Amendment
Bill, and I do not intend to repeat them.

Turning to the Insolvency Second Amendment Bill, I wish to  point  out  that
the Bill is the product of a joint effort by the Department  of  Labour  and
the Department  of  Justice.  In  1999,  the  Minister  of  Labour  and  his
department conducted a review process that included extensive  consultations
with all relevant stakeholders. The conclusion, at the end of  the  process,
was that the policy fundamentals that shape the  relevant  laws  are  sound,
but  that  adjustments  and  refinements  were  required  to   improve   the
sensitivity  of  our  legal  framework  to  the  imperatives   of   creating
employment to address unintended consequences  of  some  provisions  of  our
laws, and to ensure the effective alignment of our laws  with  the  changing
labour market environment.

Taking these observations  into  account,  the  Department  of  Labour  then
prepared draft amendments in respect of the Labour  Relations  Act  and  the
Basic Conditions of Employment Act. The  Department  of  Justice's  role  in
this initiative  was  to  prepare  a  draft  amendment  in  respect  of  the
Insolvency Act. The proposed amendments were  published  in  the  Government
Gazette in July 2000 in  order  to  solicit  comments  from  all  interested
parties. Fifty-four responses were received,  10  of  which  dealt  directly
with the draft Insolvency Bill.

The amendments deal with the issues around notices of impending  insolvency.
We are all aware that employees often become  aware  of  the  insolvency  of
their employer at a point in  the  process  where  little  can  be  done  to
ameliorate  the  consequences  of  the  insolvency.  Very  often,  they  are
confronted with the closure of work  premises,  and  even  more  often,  the
first inkling of impending doom is communicated to  the  employees  via  the
appointed liquidator or  trustee.  This  is  undesirable,  and  is  severely
detrimental to the interests of the employees.

The new legislation requires that a petitioner for the  voluntary  surrender
of an estate must furnish a copy of the notice  of  voluntary  surrender  to
registered trade unions and employees. The  notice  must  be  affixed  to  a
notice board to which the employees have  access  inside  the  premises.  If
there is no access to the premises by the  employees,  the  notice  must  be
affixed to the front gate or door of those premises. In  order  to  expedite
the administration of the estate and safeguard the interests of  the  state,
a copy of the notice must also be furnished to the SA Revenue Service.

The new Bill provides that a creditor who applies for the  sequestration  of
a  debtor's  estate  must  notify  the  employees  of  that  debtor,   their
registered  trade  unions  and  the  SA  Revenue  Service  of  the  relevant
application. For the sake of uniformity, a copy  of  the  relevant  petition
must be furnished to the debtor unless the court dispenses with the  notice.
The court will exercise its discretionary power in  this  regard  if  it  is
fully satisfied that it will be in the interests of the  debtor  or  of  the
creditor to dispense with the relevant requirement.

The  amendment  provides  for  additional  requirements   with   regard   to
provisional sequestration of a debtor's estate. This includes  that  a  copy
of a provisional sequestration order must  be  served  on  registered  trade
unions, employees and the SA Revenue  Service.  Service  on  employees  must
again take place by affixing a copy of the order to a notice  board  on  the
employer's premises or to the front gate, whichever is most appropriate.

It does not require much imagination to realise that sounding a false  alarm
in respect of a debtor's financial position may have dire  consequences  for
that debtor's business. The amendment  therefore  makes  provision  for  the
court to award compensation to the debtor if the court is satisfied  that  a
petition for sequestration amounts to an abuse of the court's procedure.

I would like to thank the officials and the committee for their  support  in
this process. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms F I  CHOHAN-KHOTA:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  one  of  the  biggest
challenges that faces members of Parliament at this time of day is  actually
staying awake, so I promise not to be too long. I rise on behalf of the  ANC
to unequivocally and  unreservedly  support  the  four  Bills  that  we  are
debating today.

Three of these Bills relate to  an  attempt  to  implement  Acts  previously
passed by this Parliament. These Acts are, as the Deputy Minister has  said,
the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination  Amendment
Act, the Promotion of  Access  to  Information  Act  and  the  Promotion  of
Administrative Justice Act. In each of these Acts,  provision  is  now  made
for the designation of presiding officers in court proceedings. The  concern
with regard to the Acts that we have already passed was that the  matter  of
separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary requires  further
protection than those Acts provide.

Simply put, Parliament has sanctioned the process that allows  the  hon  the
Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development to  designate  presiding
officers in each of these courts. As I have  said,  it  has  been  suggested
that this poses a potential problem around judicial independence.  To  avoid
problems in this regard, the department  has  pre-emptively  proposed  these
amendments, the details of which  will  be  dealt  with  by  others  in  the
portfolio committee.

The amendment  to  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and  Prevention  of  Unfair
Discrimination  Act  also  provides  for  the  designation  of  magistrates'
courts. This heralds the introduction  of  the  phased  approach,  which  is
broadly supported.
I wish to just briefly draw  attention  to  two  aspects  of  the  portfolio
committee's report relating to this  particular  amending  Bill.  The  first
issue is a substantive one that deals with the  concern  raised  by  certain
activists of the intersex community. The word `sex',  as  we  conventionally
use it, is understood in an exclusively dichotomous  sense.  Those  who  are
born intersexed are not exclusively male or female, and  it  is  trite  that
our Constitution is inherently averse to unfair discrimination of any  kind,
but in particular, to vulnerable groups. Therefore, we have  requested  that
the department investigate the possibility  of  promoting  an  amendment  by
ensuring  that  the  definition  of  sex  in  the  Equality  Act   includes,
explicitly, intersexuality. We further asked that stakeholders be  consulted
and, hopefully, we will get a report  in  this  regard  sooner  rather  than
later.

This concern, of course, arises out of our oversight role.  This  brings  me
to the very next point  that  we  raise  in  the  report,  relating  to  the
viability  and  feasibility  of  an  equality  review  committee  which  was
established in  the  first  Act.  This  review  committee  is  meant  to  be
established at some significant cost, and its role is primarily  to  monitor
the operation and efficacy of the  Equality  Act.  It  is  meant  to  submit
regular reports to the Minister on  the  operation  of  the  Act,  including
recommendations on any necessary amendments relating to its improvement.

We believe that this function is already catered for in the  very  existence
of this Parliament and the host of Chapter 9 bodies that we have,  including
the SA Human Rights Commission, the Commission for Gender Equality and  even
the Public Protector. It is  our  contention,  upon  reflection,  that  this
review committee would be an unnecessarily  expensive  duplication,  and  we
refer the matter to the department for consideration.

Lastly, the fourth amending Bill relates to the  Insolvency  Act.  It  is  a
small but very important amendment dealing with notice to employees  in  the
event of liquidation or sequestration of the employer body. My colleague  Mr
Solomons will deal with the contents of this amendment in detail.

Finally, on behalf of the Chairperson in his absence,  and  the  members  of
the portfolio committee, I would like to extend our thanks to the  officials
of the department, in particular Mr Lawrence Basset, Mr Henk  Du  Preez  and
Mr Tienie Cronjé for their efforts in this regard. We really appreciate  all
the help that they gave us.

Ms M SMUTS: Hon Chair, an identical defect in three  laws  is  corrected  by
these amendments. The trio of Acts are those giving effect to three  of  the
rights in the Bill of Rights  -  administrative  justice,  information,  and
equality.

The defect is the designation by the Minister of presiding officers  in  the
High Courts or magistrates' courts who may  hear  cases  brought  under  the
equality, information or administrative justice laws.

Allow me to say that I told members so. I told members  in  respect  of  the
Equality Act. I argued that judges and magistrates who were  hand-picked  by
the Minister would be Penuel's poodles or chihuahuas, as the case may be.  I
said in the second reading debate at  the  end  of  that  sultry  summer  of
legislating against the constitutional deadline for the passage of  the  law
as follows:


  The Minister's powers of designation of High Court  judges  is  in  clear
  breach of the Constitution. We cannot vote for a  Bill  which  undermines
  the Constitution, most especially not when it attacks the  constitutional
  order  at  its  foundation.  The  constitutional  order  rests   on   the
  independence of the judiciary, which interprets and protects  our  rights
  against the government of the day. One cannot  let  Government  designate
  classes of judges.


  Parliament should not have allowed this measure through. It is a  tragedy
  that Parliament as a whole, which stands between the  executive  and  the
  judiciary, did not throw this provision out. Hon  members,  too,  have  a
  duty under oath to uphold the Constitution and to protect citizens.

This was all the more the case when a clear  agenda  had  emerged  from  the
drafters of the Equality Act. It became quite clear that  the  Bill,  as  it
then was, intended in fact to challenge the highest court's   interpretation
of the Constitution's equality section,  and  in  addition,  a  departmental
official was quite frank with us when saying that she  had  a  problem  with
judgments, the judges and their ``attitude''.

We are delighted that the DP's position on the Equality Bill  is  vindicated
by these amendments and,  the  hon  Randy,  if  I  heard  his  interjections
correctly, should please take note  that  our  objection  is  vindicated  by
these amendments. It is actually worth listening to our arguments, in  other
words [Interjections.] ...

An HON MEMBER: Opposition is important.

Ms M SMUTS: ... and opposition is important. These amendments vindicate  our
opposition to that Bill. We did not then ... [Interjections.] The fact  that
we are standing here, amending these Bills, proves  that  we  are,  I  would
like to say to the hon Luwellyn Landers. Of course it does. So  we  did  not
then and we do not now object to the training  courses  in  themselves  when
they are in appropriate hands with appropriate safeguards.

The designation of presiding officers is back now in  the  hands  of  Judges
President and of Chief Magistrates, where it belongs, in  the  case  of  the
Equality Act, and of Chief Magistrates in the  consequential  cases  of  the
other two laws.

It is problematic that at least two of the three laws, after  two  and  half
years since their passage, are not yet a reality for the citizens that  they
must serve. Most public servants are said to be unaware  of  the  Access  to
Information Act, according to a survey by the Open Democracy Advice  Centre.
I must say that we, and perhaps other  political  parties,  receive  queries
about  the  Equality  Act  routinely  from  citizens   seeking   streamlined
remedies. I hope that these amendments herald  the  full  implementation  of
measures which are there to help make the rights a reality. [Applause.]

I commend Ms Chohan-Khota  on  her  customary  clarity,  and  just  want  to
indicate that if she is interested  in  crossing  the  floor,  she  is  very
welcome on this side of the House! [Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, the four pieces of legislation  we  are  debating
today come at a time when there is great uncertainty and  concern  in  South
Africa about job losses, increasing unemployment and growing of poverty.

Due to the limited time at my disposal, I would like to deal in more  detail
with the Insolvency Second Amendment Bill than with the other  three  Bills.
That is not to say that the other three Bills do not  also  deal  with  very
important matters in our daily lives.

The IFP  welcomes  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and  Prevention  of  Unfair
Discrimination Amendment Bill. For instance, the  training  and  designation
of presiding officers of equality courts  are  vital  in  preventing  unfair
discrimination,  and  the   Bill   also   provides   for   the   incremental
implementation of equality courts at the magistrates' courts level.

Furthermore, we can also  look  at  the  question  of  independence  of  the
judiciary and the constitutional principle of the separation of  powers.  My
belief is that independence without accountability means  nothing,  and  the
two therefore should go hand in hand.

The IFP also welcomes the  Promotion  of  Administrative  Justice  Amendment
Bill which  provides  for  regulating  the  designation  of  magistrates  or
additional magistrates for the purposes of presiding in court. Training  for
the magistrate and additional magistrates will no doubt  be  of  the  utmost
importance.

Returning  to  the  Insolvency  Second  Amendment  Bill,  the  IFP  strongly
supports the proposed amendments. It came as an eye opener  to  some  of  us
that, in the past, employees and workers would not have known the  state  of
the company they worked for, or even that the company or  the  employer  had
been declared insolvent or liquidated. The  first  time  the  workers  would
know about it was when they found the gates and doors chained and locked  or
when they were told by the trustees or liquidators.

The IFP supports the fact that the Bill  provides  that  the  employees  and
their registered trade unions must be informed of  impending  insolvency  to
enable them to find a solution that would protect their interests and  their
jobs. In a nutshell, employers will no longer be able to play with a  closed
hand, but will have to lay all their cards on the table for all to  see  the
true state of affairs.

In conclusion,  it  is  clear  that  any  employer  running  into  financial
difficulties must notify his or her employees in a manner that  will  ensure
that all employees  are  aware  of  the  situation.  This  will  create  the
opportunity for all interested parties to find a solution  for  the  problem
long  before  they  have  actually  materialised  and  may  even  result  in
protecting employees' livelihoods and  employment.  Amidst  growing  concern
over unemployment and alarming job losses, this step must be welcomed  as  a
positive attempt to help those  who  in  the  past  received  no  protection
whatsoever.

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  a  creditor  who  applies  for  the
sequestration of a debtor's estate,  must  notify  employees,  the  relevant
trade unions and the SA Revenue Service of the  application.  What  is  very
appropriate  about  these  changes  is  that  the  Bill  also  provides  for
compensation if such an application represents an abuse of  court  procedure
or is considered to be malicious.

Engithanda  ukukusho  nje  Sekela  likaNgqongqoshe  ukuthi   uma   sikhuluma
ngezinyunyana asisho ukuthi  izinyunyana  zenze  konke  okuhle  ngoba  phela
izimboni zihambe nje, zihambe ngazo izinyunyana.  Izinyunyana  yizo  ezidale
ukuthi umnotho waleli zwe ufadalale ngoba zifuna ukuthi zibe  ngama-director
ezinkampanini lapho khona zingenalungelo,  ngoba  okwazo  ukudayisa  amandla
azo izinkampani bese zibakhokhela. Kodwa sengathi sebeqile kulokho  sebefuna
ukuthi  nabo  babe  nesabelo  ekukhulumeni   izinto   zenkampani.   Yingakho
izinkampani zizohamba nje eSouth  Africa  sigcine  sesingasenalutho,  abantu
babe mpofu. Kungabi bikho misebenzi ekhona.

Siyacela-ke  ukuthi  uNgqongqoshe  akubhekisise  lokho.  Sengathi  uhulumeni
ubengake azame ukuzinciza  izinyunyana  ukuthi  cha  azingabi  ama-director,
azikhulumele  abasebenzi.  Ngiyabonga.  (Translation  of   Zulu   paragraphs
follows.)

[What I would like to say to the Deputy  Minister  is  that,  when  we  talk
about unions, we do not say  that  trade  unions  have  done  all  the  good
things, because companies left  South  Africa  as  a  result  of  the  trade
unions. Trade unionists are the ones who have caused  the  economy  of  this
country to collapse because they wanted to be directors  in  companies  when
they did not have a right to do so. Their duty is to sell their  labour  and
companies have to pay for it. Now it looks as if they overstepped the  line.
They too want to have a share in discussing the companies' issues.  That  is
why companies will leave South Africa. We will end up  having  nothing,  and
people will be poor because there will be no jobs.

We would like to ask the hon the Minister to  look  carefully  at  that.  We
want the Government to try and secretly warn the trade unionists  that  they
should not be directors. They should speak for employees.]

Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Chairperson, it will not assist this  debate  to  respond
to the hon Ms Smuts because she finds happiness in being negative.

Our struggle has always been about equality, restoration  of  human  dignity
and elimination of unfair discrimination. We  fought  for  a  society  where
people would not be judged according to the colour of  their  skin,  but  by
their character. Since 1994 we started a process of  creating  a  nonracial,
nonsexist democratic and  prosperous  South  Africa  through  people-centred
programmes and legislation.

The Bills before us are a part of this process. They are aimed  at  creating
a government and a society that is transparent, humane and  caring.  Day  by
day, the ANC-led Government makes laws which are aimed  at  empowering  each
and every citizen to enjoy rights given to him or her by  the  Constitution.
By passing these Bills, we are recommitting ourselves to the  commitment  we
made in 1965 at Kliptown when we said:


  South Africa belongs to all who live in  it,  black  and  white,  and  no
  government can just claim authority unless it is based on the will of the
  people.

The three Bills that I  am  debating  are  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and
Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Amendment Bill, the Promotion of  Access
to Information Amendment Bill and the Promotion  of  Administrative  Justice
Amendment  Bill.  The  Promotion  of  Equality  and  Prevention  of   Unfair
Discrimination Amendment Bill deals with the  training  and  designation  of
presiding  officers  of  equality  courts  and  it  also  provides  for  the
incremental implementation of equality courts at magistrate level.

Section 16(1)(a)  stipulates  that  only  a  judge  who  has  completed  the
training course contemplated in subsection 2 may be designated by the  Judge
President as a presiding officer of the  equality  court.  Section  16(1)(c)
provides that the Minister must, after consultation  with  the  head  of  an
administrative region defined in section 1 of the Magistrate Courts  Act  of
1944, designate one or more magistrates as equality  court  magistrates  for
the administrative region concerned.

The Bill further empowers the Minister to define the  area  of  jurisdiction
of each equality  court.  The  designation  of  magistrates  and  additional
magistrates will, in terms of the proposed section(1)(c),  be  left  to  the
administrative regions concerned.

The new subsection  4  places  an  obligation  on  the  Director-General  to
compile  a  list  of  the  names  of  judges,  magistrates  and   additional
magistrates who have completed the  course  as  presiding  officers  of  the
equality courts. A presiding officer of the equality courts may perform  his
or her duties as a magistrate in the normal course of events. It is only  an
officer in the Department of Justice or another  person  who  has  completed
the course as clerk of the equality court who may be appointed clerk of  the
equality court.

Under the Promotion of Administrative Justice Bill and under  the  Promotion
of Access to Information Amendment Bill, it is proposed that,  in  order  to
safeguard the independence of the judiciary, it is proposed under  clause  2
that the head of the administrative region  designate  a  magistrate  or  an
additional magistrate for the purposes of presiding  in  court  proceedings,
as contemplated in the Act, in that administrative  region.  The  Bill  also
says that only a magistrate or an additional  magistrate  who  has  received
training, the content of which is developed by  the  judiciary,  may  be  so
designated.
In as far as  the  promotion  of  equality  and  the  prevention  of  unfair
discrimination are concerned, the chief justice, in  consultation  with  the
Judicial Service Commission and the Minister, must  implement  the  relevant
courses. It is our wish that not long from now, every  court  shall  perform
all of the duties contained in these Bills.

Equality and justice must be part of our value system as people, and not  be
in the Statute Book alone. In supporting this Bill, we  would  have  made  a
major contribution in creating a nonracial and  nonsexist  democratic  South
Africa. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, the four Bills  that  we  are  debating  today
are, in the main, technical, and the New NP, along with  all  other  parties
in this House, will be supporting the Bills.  Perhaps  it  is  important  to
highlight one or two aspects of the Bills in relation to  the  Promotion  of
Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Amendment Bill.

The point needs to be made that I think the Equality Act was passed by  this
House in a great rush at the end of 1999 and promulgated early in  the  year
2000. However, this Act has been implemented in slow motion. It  is  one  of
the worst cases we are dealing with. We are  nearly  three  years  down  the
line, and the only operational part of it which  has  been  implemented,  is
the appointment of the Equality Review Committee.

According to a reply to my question on this,  given  by  the  Minister  last
week, R1,5 million has  been  found  for  this  committee  to  research,  in
conjunction with the SA Human Rights Commission, the possible  inclusion  of
HIV/Aids   status,   socioeconomic   status,    nationality    and    family
responsibility as prohibited grounds for discrimination.

The key aspect of the Act, namely the establishment of the equality  courts,
has been on ice since the passing and implementation  of  this  Bill,  which
should hopefully change. In answer to another question  I  posed  about  the
number of equality courts in existence,  the  Minister  answered  last  week
that he had already designated 48 courts as equality courts, but  that  none
were in operation. He also answered that 190  judges,  843  magistrates,  85
clerks of the magistrate courts  and  registrars  in  High  Court  had  been
trained, but none had been appointed yet.

The purpose of this Bill is  to  take  the  establishment  of  the  equality
courts forward on a properly managed basis,  and  hopefully,  at  a  quicker
pace. In this sense, this piece of legislation is catching up with  what  is
already  happening  in  the  Department  of   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development. For instance, section 3 of the Bill provides that the Director-
General of the department must develop and implement a training  course  for
clerks which includes sensitivity training. Hopefully those  85  clerks  who
have already been trained will have also received this tuition.

The  amending  Bill  improves  certain  aspects   of   the   Equality   Act,
particularly as far as transparency is concerned in  that  it  does  provide
for the Director-General to keep a list of trained and  designated  equality
courts presiding officers. The Government has rightly  had  second  thoughts
about the provision in the original Act giving the  Minister  discretion  to
appoint suitably sensitive types as equality courts presiding officers  and,
as indicated by the hon Dene Smuts, it was much criticised by  most  of  the
opposition parties as I recall, certainly ours as well at the time.  Now  he
may only appoint them if appropriately trained.

The Bill also ensures the proper spread of equality courts,  although  every
high court is an equality court. The Bill provides that the Judge  President
must designate at least one duly trained presiding  officer  to  sit  in  an
equality court in his or her area of jurisdiction,  and  the  Minister  must
designate at least  one  magistrate  court  as  an  equality  court  in  any
administrative region.

Although not yet promulgated, the regulations under the  Act  have  also  at
last seen the light of day, and it may soon be all systems go  for  equality
courts. Similarly, the Promotion of Access  to  Information  Amendment  Bill
and the  Promotion  of  Administrative  Justice  Amendment  Bill  before  us
provides for the designation of  duly  trained  magistrates  to  preside  in
cases for the purposes of these Acts.

The   Insolvency   Second   Amendment   Bill   introduces,   amongst   other
improvements, important safeguards for employees. In the case of a  petition
for the sequestration of a debtor's estate, notice must now  be  given  also
to the employees of the debtor  and  registered  trade  unions  representing
those employees. There are similar provisions in terms of the Companies  Act
for the winding up of the company.

Although the Law Society of  the  Cape  expressed  some  reservations  about
these provisions, expressing the view that might impact  negatively  on  the
liquidator's  role  in  protecting  the   assets   of   such   a   business,
nevertheless,  we  believe  that  it  is  an  appropriate  and  a  necessary
protection for these employees and we therefore support the measure.
Also, on behalf of the New NP, I would like to thank the  officials  of  the
department for all the help they gave the committee  in  relation  to  these
Bills which, although short and  sweet  and  agreed  to  across  the  board,
nevertheless entailed a lot of work on their part.

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson, hon  members,  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and
Prevention  of  Unfair   Discrimination   Amendment   Bill   regulates   the
designation of  presiding  officers  of  equality  courts,  and  also  makes
provision for the designation of magistrates courts as equality courts.

The Bill empowers the Minister to publish a  notice  in  the  Gazette  after
communication with the head of an administrative region to designate one  or
more magistrates courts as equality courts  for  the  region,  and  also  to
define the area of jurisdiction of each equality court.

A list of judges, magistrates and additional magistrates who have  completed
a training course as presiding officers of equality  courts  must  be  kept,
and such presiding  officers  must  perform  their  functions  assigned  and
conferred to them by this Act. The Bill  further  makes  provision  for  the
appointment of clerks for each equality court  by  the  Director-General  of
the department, provided such clerk has completed a  training  course  as  a
clerk of equality court. The UDM supports this  Promotion  of  Equality  and
Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Amendment Bill.

The  promotion  of  Administrative  Justice  Amendment   Bill   amends   the
definition of court in section 1 by  substituting  definition  of  court  to
mean the Constitutional Court acting in terms  of  section  167,  subsection
6(a) of the Constitution or a High Court or another court of similar  status
or a magistrates court.

Section 9(a) has been inserted after section 9 of the principal Act, and  it
deals mainly with the designation and training of presiding  officers  whose
names are included in the list after they have completed a  training  course
before the date of commencement  of  this  section  or  as  contemplated  in
subsection 5.

The heads of administrative regions must  take  all  reasonable  steps  with
available resources to designate at least one  presiding  officer  for  each
magistrates court and inform the  Director-General  and  the  Department  of
Justice and Constitutional  Development  of  any  magistrate  or  additional
magistrate who has completed  a  training  course.  The  UDM  supports  this
Promotion of Administrative Justice Amendment Bill.

The insolvency Second Amendment Bill deals with  the  manner  in  which  the
notice of petition for the sequestration of  a  debtor's  estate  should  be
handled. Section 4 of the Insolvency Act  is  amended  by  substitution  for
subsection 2(a) and (b), and stipulates a time period of  seven  days  after
the date of publication of the notice of petition in the  Gazette  when  the
petitioner must deliver or post a copy of the notice  to  all  creditors  of
the debtor whose addresses are known.

The petitioner must also, within a seven day period, furnish such copies  of
notice by post to every registered trade union that, to such  practitioner's
knowledge, represents  any  of  the  debtor's  employees  and  also  to  the
employees themselves. Such copies are to be affixed on the notice  board  to
which employees have access, inside the debtor's premises or  to  the  front
gate of the premises if  there  is  no  access  to  the  premises.  The  UDM
supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr G SOLOMON: Chairperson, as the hon Fatima Chohan-Khota has  indicated,  I
am going to deal  with  the  Insolvency  Second  Amendment  Bill  and  those
amendments requested specifically by Cosatu, dealing specifically  with  the
provisions  on  notification  in  the  process  of  the   sequestration   of
individuals, companies and close corporations.

Before the advent of Cosatu  and  its  affiliates,  it  was  common  amongst
coloured people in the townships of the Western Cape to hear the following:


  Ek het my job verloor, want die factory het toegemaak.

This literally means ``I have  lost  my  job,  because  the  factory  closed
down.'' The hon Randy Pieterse, sitting over there, is well acquainted  with
this type of experience.

What is the context of this Cape colloquial expression? I think  it  is  the
blatant  abuse  and  exploitation  of  workers  before  the  new  democratic
Constitution and progressive  labour  legislation  which  came  into  effect
under the ANC-led Government.

Let me describe a typical scenario for a worker at  that  time.  The  worker
would leave home at about six in the morning to  arrive  at  work  at  7:30.
When he/she arrived at work, the factory gates would be locked  and  bolted.
The workers would congregate outside the factory gates, ignorant and  unsure
about what was happening to  their  jobs  and  their  future.  At  about  11
o'clock, official-looking people would arrive to  inform  the  workers  that
their  employer  was  insolvent.  These  would  be  the  trustees,  or   the
liquidators of the employer.

The worst part of this scenario is that, more often than  not,  it  happened
just before the Christmas holidays when  the  employer  would  have  to  pay
holiday pay and bonuses. This had a devastating effect on workers and  their
families and their communities at large.

Cosatu has long called for the review and overhaul of the Insolvency Act  in
order to increase protection and minimise the devastating effect on  workers
when employers are liquidated. This Bill, combined with  the  provisions  of
the early Insolvency Amendment Bill, represents a significant step  in  that
direction.

In compliance with agreements reached in the Nedlac,  Cosatu  requested  the
following provisions which are contained in the amending  Bill  before  this
House: Clause 1 of the amending Bill  provides  that,  within  a  period  of
seven days from the date of publication of the notice in  the  Gazette,  the
applicant for a sequestration order must deliver a copy  of  the  notice  to
all the creditors. He/she must also, within the same period, furnish a  copy
of the notice to sequestrate to every trade union representing  any  of  the
employees. In other words, before the court can proceed to grant  the  order
of sequestration, the employees and their unions must be informed.

This creates an opportunity for trade  unions,  on  behalf  of  workers,  to
negotiate with employers and make proposals to either salvage the  business,
or stake their claims as creditors against the business.

Clause 3 makes provision to serve a copy of the rule nisi  on  trade  unions
and employees upon the court  granting  a  provisional  sequestration.  This
rule enables the employer to appear in court and show cause why his  or  her
business should not be sequestrated finally. The trade  unions  and  workers
must be given the same opportunity to show cause  why  the  business  should
not be sequestrated finally.
Clause 7 provides that, after the  final  order  is  granted,  a  winding-up
order not only be served on the employer, but also on the trade  unions  and
the employees. A winding-up order is where a  curator  or  administrator  is
appointed to consolidate assets and liabilities, that is, what  he  has  and
what he owes to pay the debts from what is left of the  business.  In  other
words, the workers will know what  assets  are  left  in  order  to  recover
outstanding wages and benefits.

These amendments, called for by Cosatu, empower workers to  be  informed  of
the whole process of sequestration and to make interventions, if  necessary,
in their own interests. As a collective, the workers, in terms of wages  and
benefits, are certainly a major creditor and  cannot  be  left  out  of  the
process.

The ANC supports Cosatu's positions and the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, the ACDP is  on  record  as  having  opposed  the
Equality Bill due, inter allia to its protection of sexual  orientation  and
abortion. Notwithstanding this position, however, we support the  principles
of equality and non-discrimination as seen from a Biblical world  view,  and
we believe  the  proposed  amendments  contained  in  this  Bill  should  be
supported.

As has been pointed out, the amendments are technical and seek  to  regulate
the designation of presiding officers of equality  courts,  and  to  provide
for their training with a view to building a dedicated and experienced  pool
of trained and specialised officers. The amendment meets the objection  that
the present definition dealing  with  the  designation  of  magistrates  and
judges infringes on the independence of the judiciary and the  principle  of
the separation of powers passed. In this connection, we commend  the  DP  on
the position they took, which has now been  vindicated.  Similar  objections
were raised to the Promotion  of  Administrative  Justice  Act  and  to  the
Promotion of Access to  Information  Act  which  have  resulted  in  similar
amendments.

The fourth amending Bill, as has been pointed  out,  relates  to  insolvency
and  makes  provision  for  notice  to  be  given  to  employees  and  other
institutions when the employer is declared insolvent. There  are  amendments
both to the Insolvency and the  Company  Acts,  which  seek  to  advise  the
employees and the registered trade unions of insolvency at  an  early  stage
to enable them to assist in finding solutions to the financial  difficulties
of the employer, and to warn  them  about  the  financial  position  of  the
employer. An important amendment to both the  Insolvency  and  Company  Acts
provide for compensation if an application for sequestration  of  an  estate
or the winding up of the company is an abuse of the  court's  procedures  or
is malicious or vexatious. We trust that this section will reduce the  large
number of sequestrations and liquidations the country faces  each  year  and
allow these individuals or companies  a  period  of  grace  to  bring  their
financial affairs into order and to enable them to pay  their  debts.  [Time
expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the Promotion of  Administrative  Justice  Act
is strongly supported by the MF in  view  that  it  aims  at  upholding  the
constitutional responsibility of section 33.

However, it is felt that the Act did have a few loopholes, one of  which  is
that presiding magistrates reviewing administration actions  need  not  have
any specialised skills to deal with the specified action arising out of  the
Act.  This  Bill  corrects  this  by  allowing  only  magistrates  who  have
undergone a special training course to preside over such matters.

It is very important to ensure that  persons  holding  such  positions  must
have the correct tools to ensure that  efficient  and  effective  procedures
further the provisions  that  allow  Parliament  to  maintain  a  degree  of
oversight over the process, and to also allow for greater transparency  and,
in turn, accountability. The promotion of equality  and  the  prevention  of
unfair discrimination are also to be  upheld  as  a  part  of  our  national
Constitution that governs supreme.
The MF supports the establishment of equality courts that the Bill  aims  at
putting in place, as well as the appointment of presiding officers.  The  MF
further supports the amendment made to  the  Insolvency  Act  and  finds  it
necessary for their fulfilment of the Bill. The MF  supports  the  Promotion
of Equality and Prevention of  Unfair  Discrimination  Amendment  Bill,  the
Promotion of  Administrative  Justice  Amendment  Bill  and  the  Insolvency
Second Amendment Bill.

Mr M T MASUTHA: Chairperson and hon members, in addressing the  three  Bills
which deal with similar  matters,  namely  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and
Prevention  of  Unfair  Discrimination  Amendment  Bill,  the  Promotion  of
Administrative Justice  Amendment  Bill  and  the  Promotion  of  Access  to
Information  Amendment  Bill,  allow  me  to  commence  by  reiterating  our
commitment, as the ANC, to the independence of the  judiciary  which,  as  a
constitutional  value,  we  consider   indispensable   to   sustaining   the
constitutional democracy.

However, I must express dismay at hon Dene Smuts for having the audacity  to
come and tell us and educate  us  with  her  so-called  ``I  told  you  so''
speech, despite not having attended any committee meetings which  considered
all these Bills about the independence of the judiciary. It  is  typical  of
someone who wants to act as a judge when that person  has  not  participated
in the judicial proceedings which should lead to  the  judgment,  except  by
way of remote control. These three Bills ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Masutha, please  take  your  seat.
Are you prepared to take a question from Ms Smuts?

Mr M T MASUTHA: No, I do not have the time to answer  her  question.  I  can
deal with her question after we adjourn.

These three Bills assist in resolving the question on how far  the  role  of
the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development  should  go  in  the
advancement of  the  effective  and  efficient  administration  of  justice,
without in any way interfering  with  the  independence  of  the  judiciary.
These three Bills seek to strike this delicate  balance  by,  amongst  other
things, retaining the powers of the Minister to  designate  the  specialised
courts for the implementation of the specialised areas of  the  law  on  the
one hand, and deferring the actual  appointment  of  judicial  officers  for
these  courts  and  the  determination  of  appropriate  training  for  such
judicial officers to the judiciary itself, on the other.

Turning to the Insolvency Second Amendment Bill, I should  start  by  saying
that this  Bill  is  yet  another  explicit  demonstration  of  the  ANC-led
Government's unwavering commitment to the advancement of  the  interests  of
the working class  and  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  the  alliance's
national democratic revolution.

It is not uncommon that the  first  time  workers  are  informed  about  the
insolvency of their employer is when, on a morning of a normal working  day,
they find the gates and doors of the premises where they work  closed.  Only
after a desperate search for information  are  they  then  informed  by  the
liquidator of the insolvency of their employer.

The Bill before us seeks to change all of that by  requiring  notice  to  be
given by a petitioner who has become bankrupt of the voluntary surrender  of
his, her or its  estate  to  the  workers  and  their  representative  trade
unions. A similar obligation is imposed on a creditor who  applies  for  the
sequestration of a debtor's estate. In addition, a  copy  of  a  provisional
sequestration order, that is a rule nisi in legal lingua, must be served  on
employees and their registered trade unions.

In view of the serious consequences that a notice of insolvency may have  on
workers, if an insolvency is  in  fact  not  imminent,  the  Bill  seeks  to
counteract  such  potential  abuse  by  empowering  the   court   to   award
compensation to a debtor if a petition for  sequestration  is  an  abuse  of
court process, malicious  or  vexatious.  Similar  provisions  are  made  in
respect of liquidation of companies and  closed  corporations  in  order  to
align the Companies Act of 1973 and the Closed  Corporations  Act  of  1984,
respectively, with these amendments  of  the  Insolvency  Act  in  order  to
maintain consistency in this regard.

The ANC, in supporting this Bill, wishes to express its gratitude to  Cosatu
for its valuable contribution in the development of  these  Bills.  Already,
the current Labour Relations Act has, with the recent enactment  of  section
197 (b), made provision for an employer  who  faces  financial  difficulties
that may reasonably result in the winding up or sequestration of his or  her
business, to advise amongst  others,  a  workplace  forum,  trade  union  or
representative nominated by the  employees  accordingly.  The  same  applies
where an employer applies for and receives an application for  sequestration
or winding up of his or her business. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:   Mr
Chairperson, I would like to thank all the  members  for  their  support  of
these amendments, and I would just like to make  a  couple  of  comments  on
some of the inputs that I found very useful.

The hon Chohan-Kota made  some  observations  about  the  use  of  the  word
``sex'' and the dichotomous nature of that descriptive word. We  have  taken
note, and I will certainly be taking it back to the Ministry to look  at.  I
fully agree with the  hon  member  that  it  does  not  speak  well  to  the
principles that underlie our Constitution and  the  values  of  equality.  I
also think that the hon  member's  comments  on  the  Review  Committee  are
interesting, and  these  will  also  be  taken  back  to  the  Ministry  for
consideration.

The hon Mzizi referred to unions acting as directors. I think that  the  hon
Solomons' input provided a really good reply to that view, in terms  of  the
fairness that this new legislation or this amendment holds for workers.

Workers have always been kept in the dark, to their  detriment,  even  under
the best circumstances, let alone when information was  withheld  from  them
with the view to doing  them  in.  So,  I  would  like  to  think  that  the
legislation speaks to the values of our Constitution and to the values  that
we uphold with our  partners  in  the  alliance.  I  do  believe  that  this
amendment will not be abused, particularly because of the  fairness  of  its
inputs.

I would like to thank the hon Solomon for putting  the  legislation  into  a
context that we could all relate  to.  I  found  it  very  useful.  It  does
reassure one, once the legislation is through, that one can feel good  about
what it is doing for the people of our country.

The hon Masutha, as usual, made some thoughtful inputs on this, and I  think
that we are all now fully conversant with the aspects that these  amendments
include. I would like to thank  the  members  for  their  support  of  these
amendments, and I look forward to the swift implementation of  the  equality
legislation  because,  I  think,  this  really  does  make   provision   for
incremental and sustainable delivery. [Applause.]

     section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act  No  1
     of 1999). The letter explains that the delay  in  the  tabling  of  the
     Annual Report and Financial Statements of Transnet Limited  is  due  to
     the auditors' verifications and amendments to the financial sections of
     the Annual Report which resulted in the delay in the  printing  of  the
     final Annual Report.


     The Annual Report of Transnet Limited will be available for tabling  in
     Parliament not later than 31 October 2002.

2.    The Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry:


     Letter from the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry tabled in  terms
     of section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act  No
     1 of 1999). The letter explains that the delay in the  tabling  of  the
     Annual Report and Financial Statements of Bloem Water was  due  to  the
     fact that the report had too many flaws and was not reflective  of  the
     performance of the Bloem Water. To protect the image  of  Bloem  Water,
     the Chief Executive Officer, Mr L Pelepele, referred the document  back
     to the relevant manager for re-compilation.
