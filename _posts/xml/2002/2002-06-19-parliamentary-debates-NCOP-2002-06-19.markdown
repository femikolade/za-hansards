                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the results of the exhaustive 10-month-old  study  conducted  by
           the City of Cape Town's IDP team  to  identify  the  needs  that
           Capetonians want local government to meet;


       (b)   that  the  process  included  extensive  surveys,  public   and
           stakeholder consultation and market analysis; and


       (c)  that, according to the representative household survey  among  1
           200 residents, Capetonians were unanimous that crime  (99%)  and
           unemployment (98%) were the top issues to be addressed;


  (2) therefore notes with alarm  that  the  rate  of  cash-van  heists  in
       greater Cape Town has shot up by 300% to 24 in the first  six  months
       of the year as opposed to 6 for the same period last year;


  (3) also notes that Organised Crime detective, Gavin Brink, and his  team
       have identified and obtained warrants for the arrest of the six  most
       wanted suspects linked to one or more of the heists; and


  (4) wishes the team well in their quest to end this plague  of  robberies
       in Cape Town, and urges the authorities to give them every assistance
       to make this possible.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the reports over alleged practices  of  corruption
       by certain Department  of  Correctional  Services  officials  at  the
       Grootvlei Prison in Bloemfontein;


  (2) expresses its appreciation at the efforts of  the  Minister  and  his
       department to expose all kinds of corruption within the Department of
       Correctional Services;


  (3)  commends  those  responsible  for  blowing  the  whistle   on   this
       corruption; and


  (4) believes their noteworthy actions are in line with  the  Government's
       zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and with the call  by  our
       President on South Africans to blow the whistle on corruption  within
       the Public Service.

    CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECISION REGARDING PROVISIONS OF MAGISTRATES ACT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) welcomes the decision of the Constitutional Court with regard to  the
       constitutionality of certain provisions of the Magistrates Act;


  (2) notes  that  the  Constitutional  Court  overturned  the  High  Court
       judgment of Mr Justice Southwood who, in his judgment,  among  others
       referred to the magistrates' profession as the  personal  fiefdom  of
       the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development;


  (3) further notes that most of the  provisions  that  were  found  to  be
       unconstitutional  by  Justice   Southwood   were   crucial   to   the
       transformation of the magistrates' profession;


  (4) believes the Constitutional Court judgment is a  vindication  of  the
       arguments of the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development;
       and


  (5) further  believes  the  decision  will  lay  a  firm  basis  for  the
       acceleration of transformation within the magistrates' profession.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         UNITED NATIONS FOOD SUMMIT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I move without notice:

       the United Nations' Secretary-General,  Kofi  Annan,  at  the  United
       Nations Food Summit in Rome;


  (2) affirms that the right to food is a fundamental human right  and  its
       promotion  constitutes  a  moral  imperative  for  the  international
       community; and

       towards the summit.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any  objection  to  that

motion.

               TENSION BETWEEN TWO COMMUNITIES OF SCHMIDSDRIFT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr J HORNE: Voorsitter, ek stel hiermee sonder kennis voor:
  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met kommer kennis neem van die beweerde verkragting en moord  van  'n
       Xhu-vrou deur 'n Khwe-man wat gelei het tot ernstige spanning  tussen

       vrede herstel kan word.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion without notice follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the alleged rape and murder of a Xhu  woman  by  a
       Khwe man, which led to serious tension between the two communities of
       Schmidsdrift in the Northern Cape; and


  (2) makes a serious but urgent appeal to the two communities to give  the
       relevant authorities the opportunity to investigate the alleged crime
       and not to take the law into their own hands, so that calm and  peace
       can be restored.]

                 USE OF A SOLEMN OCCASION FOR POLITICAL GAIN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with contempt the attempt by the DP/FF alliance to use a solemn
       occasion such as  the  funeral  of  the  late  Mr  Peter  Mokaba  for
       political gain;


  (2) notes that the DA's accusations come  at  a  time  when  yet  another

       Cape provincial chairperson;


  (3) strongly believes that the DA leader has no credible defence  against
       the charges of corruption levelled against his party; and


  (4) is of the opinion that the  accusations  of  the  DA  are  merely  an
       attempt to deflect public attention from the deep crisis in which the
       DA finds itself.

[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order! Is there any objection  to
that motion? There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes  notice  of
a motion.

         RESPONSE TO CHANTING OF ``KILL THE FARMER; KILL THE BOER!''

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) takes note with gratitude of the stance of the  Minister  of  Defence
       and the President, Mr Mbeki, in their condemnation of the attitude of
       the people who used the chant: ``Kill the farmer; kill  the  boer-!''
       as a call to racist action; and


  (2) requests members of the Council who on 18  June  2002  voted  down  a
       motion which asked for exactly that  sentiment  to  reconsider  their
       views, particularly in the light of what  their  fellow  ANC  members
       have said.

[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any  objection  to  that

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 20 - Correctional Services:

Vote No 21 - Defence:

Vote No 23 - Justice and Constitutional Development:

Vote No 24 - Safety and Security:

The  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,
Deputy President ... [Laughter.] Did I say Deputy President?  [Laughter.]  I
must apologise  for  unwittingly  suggesting  the  demotion  of  the  Deputy
President. [Laughter.] My apologies.

Chairperson, it is my pleasure  to  report  to  this  honourable  House  the
efforts of my Ministry and our cluster at fulfilling  the  promise  we  have
made, that is of serving our people to  the  best  of  our  ability.  As  we
observed last Friday, we locate our work firmly within  the  four  walls  of
the President's vision of a New Partnership for Africa's Development.

Part of what we undertake to do in this context is to promote  a  collective
commitment  to  democracy,  the  entrenchment  of  fundamental  rights   and
freedoms for all people, including women and children, good  governance  and
the  rule  of  law,  underpinned  by  an  array  of   adequately   resourced
enforcement mechanisms so that our country becomes a  positively  infectious
prototype, a beacon of hope and a  shining  example  for  the  rest  of  the
world.

During the past year we visited several courts throughout  the  country.  In
certain areas we  found  the  prevailing  conditions  unacceptable  and  not
conducive to service. Consequently,  my  department  has  reprioritised  the
budget allocation and we intend to report what we are seeking to achieve  by
way of upgrading the infrastructure.

Nine new magistrates' courts are ready to be  inaugurated,  39  major  works
services are currently under construction, 51 courts in mostly  rural  areas
are on our repair and maintenance programme for  the  current  MTEF  period,
and 31 justice centres have already been launched by  the  Legal  Aid  Board
and 7 more are scheduled to be launched this year as part of a  major  roll-
out plan. This hefty shift from judicare, it should be  noted,  has  already
halved the cost of provision of professional legal assistance  to  the  most
indigent in both civil and criminal matters.

Nine community safety centres have benefited or will be benefiting from  our
national community safety centre programme.  The  construction  of  six  new
court buildings will commence this year, funds permitting. Our  emphasis  is
on the provision of facilities in areas of greatest need.  The  construction
of  new  court   buildings   at   Khayelitsha,   Blue   Downs,   Botshabelo,
Atteridgeville, Bothithong, Atamelang and Muldersdrift clearly  demonstrates
my and  my  department's  determination  in  this  regard.  In  addition,  a
contract for a new building at Tembisa should be  awarded  within  the  next
four months. The estimated amount for all this is R45 million.

I am also pleased to inform this House that the sod-turning ceremony of  the
new building for the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg,  which  is  going
to form part of the Constitutional Hill Legacy Project,  took  place  on  18
October  last  year.  This  is  our  single  most  significant  project   in
execution, as it will not only provide the  highest  court  of  our  country
with appropriate accommodation, but it will also be the first  major  public
building of the new era of constitutionalism and democracy.

Reducing critical case backlogs and the  population  of  prisoners  awaiting
trial is one of our major challenges as a cluster. To be successful we  must
implement an integrated package  of  solutions.  The  modernisation  of  our
criminal justice system, known as the Integrated Justice System, must  serve
as  the  backbone  of  our  partnership.  We  have  made  great  strides  in
developing a criminal and civil case  management  system  called  the  Court
Process Project.

At the Durban magistrates' court a pilot project  has  been  established  to
develop one of the world's first integrated methods of managing  courts  and
caseloads. The overall objective is to reduce the average  case-cycle  time.
The project has already yielded the following  results:  4  500  cases  have
been electronically managed in seven courts since the beginning  of  October
last year; 718 juvenile cases were attended to in  the  same  period;  since
February this year lost dockets have become a thing of  the  past  in  cases
where this intervention has already been introduced; no  postponements  have
been experienced as a result of lost charge sheets; and no  cases  of  wrong
identification of accused persons have been reported since the beginning  of
the implementation of the project.

We are currently rolling out the project  to  Johannesburg.  The  integrated
case  management  system   will   be   a   world   first   when   completed,
notwithstanding an extremely limited budget.

Other  initiatives  that  will  impact  on  service  delivery  include   the
following: the Digital Nervous System - all courts  will  be  provided  with
electronic  infrastructure  by  the  end   of   October   next   year;   the
establishment  of  the  Intranet;  the  court   manager's   programme;   the
introduction  of  mechanisms   to   reduce   the   awaiting-trial   prisoner
population; and the development of a civil  solution  which  will  eliminate
the use of hard copies as all  case  documents  will  be  online  from  that
critical date.

Let me just highlight a few of our  other  endeavours.  Firstly,  under  the
leadership of the Chief Justice we are considering consolidated  legislation
that  will  deal  with  the  whole  court  hierarchy.  This   includes   the
rationalisation of high courts and lower courts.

Secondly, we  are  ready  to  implement  several  important  recommendations
relating to the interim rationalisation of the jurisdiction of some  of  the
seats of the High Court under the High Court Act of 2001. This  will  impact
positively on access to justice in five provinces.

Thirdly, the re-demarcation  of  magisterial  boundaries  has  largely  been
finalised and I am awaiting a report in this regard.

Lastly, we are  furthermore  on  the  verge  of  introducing  a  new  local,
decentralised court support services model, based on locating  the  delivery
of support services at the closest point to customers, that is, the  courts.
It is a feature of this model that support services are not  delivered  from
the regional level. I will therefore be phasing out regional  offices.  This
system is intended to co-ordinate  the  efforts  of  those  who  manage  the
entirety of the system, from the police to the  prosecution  authority,  the
judiciary and Correctional Services in a goal-oriented manner.

The Integrated Justice  System  court  centre  project  is  currently  being
implemented  on  a  pilot  basis  at  23  courts  throughout  the   country,
particularly where case backlogs are unacceptably  high.  The  establishment
of a court performance review committee to oversee performance  and  service
delivery at courts has led  to  the  establishment  of  emergency  teams  to
assist in this respect.

The following statistics will indicate the fact that  the  criminal  justice
system is improving progressively  in  its  objective  to  help  make  South
Africa safer.

Firstly, sentenced prisoners increased from 115 267 in  April  2001  to  123
498 in March 2002. Secondly, district courts  finalised  313  822  cases  in
2001, an increase from 219 416 cases  in  1999.  Thirdly,  regional  courts,
where the more serious cases are heard, also dealt  with  44  301  cases  in
2001, in comparison with the 28 579 cases in 1999. We have also  managed  to
reduce the outstanding cases in the regional courts from 45 473 in  2001  to
42 877 in  2002.  Lastly,  during  2001  the  high  courts  achieved  a  77%
conviction rate, the regional courts 66% and the district courts 83%.

Partly responsible for  these  achievements  was  the  continuation  of  our
Saturday and additional courts project. This  very  successful  project  was
broadened in March this year to an average of 104 Saturday  courts.  Thirty-
one more courts are currently participating in  the  project.  The  Saturday
courts sat on average five hours and 15 minutes per Saturday in  March,  and
finalised 1Â 630 cases, each with a verdict, in March 2002.

Eighty-four additional courts, which finalised 1 972 cases, participated  in
the project this past March, compared to 37  additional  courts  last  year.
The conviction rate of all the Saturday and additional courts in March  this
year was 75%. Up to March 2002, 21 924  cases  had  been  finalised  on  the
basis of this project since its inception in February  last  year.  We  have
already exceeded the target of 15 000 cases.
While it may be tempting in certain circles to suggest  that  the  judiciary
is not transforming, the figures tell a different  story.  Whereas  in  1994
there were only two women judges and one black judge,  today  there  are  23
women and 76 black judges out of a total of 204. Out of a  total  of  1  662
magistrates, 794 are black and 428 are women. [Applause.]

My department has prioritised the protection of  children  in  the  criminal
justice system. The Child Justice Bill which deals with children accused  of
crimes will be introduced to Parliament shortly. As a  society  we  need  to
deal aggressively with the scourge of child abuse. The  full  might  of  the
law needs to be  used  against  child  abusers,  no  matter  who  they  are;
religious leaders included.

There is no backing down in making choices in order to make a difference  in
the lives of our people, especially those trapped in the  cycle  of  poverty
and underdevelopment. In fact, our President, in his Youth  Day  address  in
Bloemfontein this past Sunday identified homelessness,  hunger  and  poverty
as the country's new enemy. To quote the President:


  For it is this battle that will take us to the destination  of  sustained
  development and prosperity for our people.

It is essential that we persist in our attempts to provide opportunities  to
women in order  to  combat  all  forms  of  violence,  poverty,  hunger  and
homelessness.  The  quest  to  come  up  with  an  effective  and  practical
maintenance system has  therefore  become  the  obsession  of  a  number  of
experts, both from within Government and in the private sector.

Relating to the progress on the implementation of  the  Maintenance  Act  of
1998, I  would  like  to  highlight  the  following  aspects.  Firstly,  the
National  Prosecuting  Authority  is  in  the  process  of  finalising   the
appointment  of  80  maintenance  officers   and   10   senior   maintenance
prosecutors.

Secondly, the department is  very  conscious  of  the  need  to  ensure  the
progressive realisation of the appointment of maintenance investigators.  An
amount of  R20  million  has  already  been  set  aside  to  kick-start  the
implementation of the law in this regard.

Lastly, the department has further prioritised maintenance within a  project
called the Footprint for Justice in South Africa. In this  regard  financial
transactions will be diverted through automation via our  banks,  the  South
African Post Office and even ATMs.

Our interdepartmental management team requires R20  million  for  our  anti-
rape research and strategy focus. The research process  aims  to  look  into
the  prevention  of  rape,  how  effectively  the  criminal  justice  system
responds to rape, and to evaluate the  support  structures  that  exist  for
victims as well as  offenders.  Simultaneously,  the  team  will  embark  on
processes to deal with the crisis where appropriate, while placing  emphasis
on building the new.

The impact of commercial crime  has  necessitated  a  collective  effort  by
Government and business. As a result, two  focused  commercial  court  pilot
projects have been established in Gauteng and  are  operational  to  provide
the much-needed specialisation in complex commercial crime  cases.  More  of
these courts will become operative very soon.

On 12 June 2002 the Constitutional  Court  set  aside  a  Johannesburg  High
Court ruling declaring a section of the Prevention of  Organised  Crime  Act
constitutionally invalid. The victory is an important one  for  justice  and
the National Prosecuting Authority, as it will allow  us  to  continue  with
court action aimed at freezing assets in about 30 cases currently delayed.

In my address to the House of Traditional Leaders  in  March  this  year,  I
reported the following. Firstly, in terms of section 8 of  the  Justices  of
the Peace and Commissioners of Oaths Act, 1963, I have,  through  Government
Notice  No  R1180  of  17  November  2000,  designated  all  duly  appointed
traditional leaders as ex officio commissioners of oath.

This is an important measure to ensure that the  administration  of  justice
is brought closer to the communities. The department has taken  the  further
step of making traditional leaders  aware  of  their  powers  by  conducting
workshops in this regard. Procedure manuals on the role of commissioners  of
oaths have also been distributed to the traditional leaders.

Schedule 6 of  the  Constitution  provides  that  ``every  court,  including
courts of traditional leaders,  existing  when  the  new  Constitution  took
effect, continues to function and to exercise jurisdiction in terms  of  the
legislation applicable to it.'' As such, there  is  no  question  about  the
existence  of  traditional  courts,  and  the  Constitution  recognises  and
protects them.

Traditional courts have both civil and criminal jurisdiction. In so  far  as
criminal jurisdiction is concerned,  traditional  courts  have  jurisdiction
over statutory offences and offences in terms of common  law,  except  those
specified under the third schedule of the Black Administration Act of  1927.
The excluded  offences  are  mainly  the  most  serious  offences,  such  as
treason, sedition, murder, culpable homicide, rape, arson and robbery.

In civil cases, traditional courts may award  compensation  and  restitution
to successful parties  and  may  also,  in  appropriate  cases,  require  an
apology for the wronged party in order to promote reconciliation.

If a party is not satisfied with the decision of the traditional  court,  he
or she may note an appeal to the magistrate's court with  jurisdiction  over
the district concerned; and further appeals may be taken to the High  Court,
the Supreme Court of Appeal and, if I may say so, the  Constitutional  Court
itself. A challenge we are facing is  to  ensure  that  proceedings  in  the
traditional courts are conducted in a manner which is  compatible  with  the
Constitution. In this regard,  comprehensive  legislation  is  necessary  to
promote compliance with  the  fundamental  human  rights  enshrined  in  our
Constitution.

Essentially, the legal  task  of  implementing  our  Constitution  and  thus
creating a human rights-based order is the responsibility of my  department.
Justice has had over 85 key new pieces of legislation  passed  in  the  past
seven years, including the Promotion  of  Administrative  Justice  Act,  the
Promotion of Access to Information Act and equality legislation. The  impact
of  these  new  pieces  of  legislation  is  phenomenal.  They  have  to  be
administered, financed and monitored, needless to say.

As things stand, the focus of attention of my  relatively  small  department
is  scattered  over  a  very  wide  range  of  far-reaching   transformation
processes. Nevertheless, as I stated in my Budget Vote speech, I have  seven
priorities. These are: filling most of the existing vacancies,  particularly
in the National Prosecuting Authority and the magistracy to improve  service
delivery; reducing critical case  backlogs  and  the  numbers  of  prisoners
awaiting  trial;  introducing  a  new  court  management  system;  improving
budgeting and financial management systems; having more courts and  improved
service delivery in places of most need;  having  an  effective  maintenance
and child support system; and restructuring the Master's offices.

I want to express my appreciation for the assistance  we  receive  from  the
legal profession, the most prominent aspect of which  is  the  service  they
render as acting presiding officers in the small claims court,  lower  court
and High Court, free of charge in most instances.

Lastly, I also want to take this opportunity to thank all  the  hon  members
for the understanding they exhibit of the efforts that we  are  making,  and
to thank my cluster colleagues for the good work that we want to believe  we
are doing together and for the spirit in which  our  business  and  meetings
are conducted. [Applause.]
Kgoshi  M  L  MOKOENA:  Chairperson,  during  the  budget  briefing  by  the
department of Safety and Security on 14 May some  questions  were  asked  by
committee members. Some were partly answered, some were not.

The department promised to come back to  us  with  a  response  as  soon  as
possible. They  even  promised  to  come  back  to  us  before  18  June.  I
personally made some follow-ups, but to no avail. A  three-lined  letter  in
response only came yesterday after I phoned them in the morning. If  members
of this committee and their  respected  chairperson,  who  is  handsome  ...
[Laughter] ... are not be taken  seriously  by  the  department,  then  what
about uJwara, Mofokeng, Chirwali or Magubane out there?

We agreed as a committee that as the department is  not  ready  to  give  us
some answers, we are left with  no  choice  or  option  but  to  direct  our
questions to the hon the Minister. I am now doing exactly that. Is  the  hon
the Minister aware that since 1994 in the Presidential Protection Unit  here
in Cape Town, at Tuynhuys, only men have been promoted to senior  positions,
to  the  ranks  of  officers?  The  department  was  asked  to  verify  this
information, but apparently  they  were  too  busy  to  do  so.  Whoever  is
responsible for providing names or recommending names to  the  Minister  has
not done his or her homework properly.

The first item I want to mention is  how  the  department  is  dealing  with
corruption amongst its members.  Are  we  on  course  in  transforming  this
department? How are we dealing with  some  racial  tendencies  or  practices
among members of  the  Police  Service,  especially  in  key  units  in  the
department? It is encouraging to learn that  the  level  of  crime  in  this
country is going down. We can only urge our Police Service to  keep  up  the
good work.

During our provincial week in March we  visited  some  police  stations  and
discovered the following:  a  shortage  of  vehicles  and  staff;  very  few
facilities to enable those stations to function  properly;  an  instance  of
one investigation officer handling more  than  30  dockets;  a  shortage  of
office accommodation; very few police stations with victim support  centres.
All these things need money. Can I, on behalf of all our police stations  in
this country, plead with the Minister that in the next budget  provision  is
made to cater for these urgent needs?

The next item is the question of rape cases, which  is  a  bit  problematic.
Our courts need to be consistent when dealing with  the  question  of  rape.
There are trends in the interpretation of the minimum sentence principle  in
case law. Recent case law relating  to  rape  has  illustrated  the  tension
between individualisation and uniformity  of  sentencing  practices  by  the
South African judiciary. Vague terminology  within  the  Criminal  Procedure
Amendment  Act  has   led   to   inconsistency   in   highly   controversial
interpretations of mandatory minimum services.

In my humble opinion, I think the core problem is the  phrase  ``substantial
and compelling circumstances''  used  in  the  Act.  Establishing  the  true
meaning of the phrase has led to a series of widely divergent  constructions
in the High Court. I know the hon Minister will say something about this.

Another item is that I learnt the SA Law  Commission  is  proposing  that  a
draft  Bill  called  ``Sentencing  Framework   Bill''   be   introduced   in
Parliament. We are waiting eagerly for it. Perhaps this Bill can solve  some
of our problems in regard to sentencing.

The next item I want to bring up is the delay in finalising cases, which  is
cause  for  concern.  Surprisingly,  investigating  officers   are   blaming
prosecutors, and prosecutors  are  blaming  the  investigating  officers.  I
think the time for pointing fingers has long passed. We need some action.

Another item I want to  mention  is  Grootvlei  Prison.  Can  I  really  say
something about the recent startling revelations? No, I  do  not  think  so.
Maybe later. I am just embarrassed. Let the Minister deal with it,  not  me.
But if I had my way, I would take a truck, load up all those prison  warders
and dump them somewhere.

There was  a  time  when  prisons  were  there  to  punish  people,  not  to
rehabilitate them. The programmes introduced by the department are  welcome.
One must look at what  our  prisoners  have  done.  An  example  is  at  the
Mutshalingana school. Those prisoners are excelling. I  can  only  urge  the
Minister to do the same in other prisons.

Next, if I could pose this  question  to  the  House,  I  know  I  will  get
different answers. Who is responsible for the overcrowding in  our  prisons?
Is it that the police are arresting many criminals? Is  it  that  cases  are
piling up unnecessarily? Is it that  our  prisons  cannot  accommodate  more
than expected? What is the reason? I say: Do not  mind,  the  Minister  will
respond.

My next question is: How far are we with the establishment of an  integrated
justice system, IJS, task team whose aim was to  develop  solutions  to  the
problem of awaiting-trial prisoners? How far are we with the  implementation
of electronic  monitoring?  This  would  also  include  a  proposal  by  the
department to use the inmate tracking system.

The next issue is that there was a time when the role  of  our  SANDF,  then
called the SADF, was to shoot and kill the so-called enemies of  the  state.
We are proud to say our Defence Force is now involved in  crime  prevention,
street patrol, etc. They are always available to give a  hand  in  times  of
need. Their efforts do not go unnoticed.

My next item is that there is a  call  by  the  department  to  young  South
Africans  to  join  or  participate  in  the  military  skills   development
programme. One must just listen as I know  the  Minister  will  unpack  what
this is all about.

The next thing I want to say is that the sooner we get rid of the  uncalled-
for racial tendencies in our Defence  Force  the  better.  These  tendencies
have no place in our force. Whilst we understand that members of this  force
come from different backgrounds, we can only remind them to set aside  their
interests and put  the  interests  of  the  country  first,  or  vest  their
interests in their decorated graves.

I would like to thank the four departments for working as a unit. The  light
at the end of this tunnel is  very  bright.  Teamwork  makes  common  people
attain uncommon results. The greatest thing in the  world  is  not  so  much
where we are, but in what direction we are moving.  Again,  I  have  spoken.
[Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, in the first  instance  I  wish  to  thank  the
Minister of Defence for having a meeting with the delegation  from  the  New
NP yesterday, almost immediately after having been requested,  in  order  to
discuss our concerns regarding the chanting of the infamous slogan that  was
referred to. We agreed that a successful South African nation  is  dependent
on  good  intercommunity  relationships,  and  that  the  fight  is  against
poverty,  disease  and  crime.  This  requires  a  joint   effort   by   all
communities.

There is no place in society today for slogans  such  as  ``Kill  the  boer,
kill the farmer'' which serve to divide rather than to unite. Also,  at  the
funeral, in fact, a member  of  Mr  Mokaba's  own  family  repudiated  those
chanting the slogan, saying that the emphasis of the pre-1994  struggle  was
inappropriate  given  our  late   colleague's   efforts   to   bring   about
reconciliation in the new South Africa. It is unfortunate that this was  not
reflected in reports on the funeral.

I also wish to thank the  Minister  of  Safety  and  Security  for  meeting,
almost immediately after having been so requested, with  a  delegation  from
my party yesterday regarding our concerns pertaining  to  the  farm  attacks
and murders, in the light of the gruesome murder over  the  weekend  of  the
late Mr and Mrs Dent on their farm  in  KwaZulu-Natal  in  the  presence  of
their young boy. Our delegation  was  both  impressed  with  the  Minister's
seriousness and the sense of urgency with which he approached this  problem.
It is clear to us that he is committed to finding a solution to the  serious
problem of farm attacks and murders. We thank him for that.

In reply to my question to the Deputy President last year,  he  stated  that
the stabilisation of crime levels was targeted  to  take  place  during  the
period 2001-2003 and that the normalisation of  crime  levels,  compared  to
``international standards'' - those were his words - was  targeted  to  take
place during the period 2003 to 2009.

During the President's review debate on 13 November 2001,  I  requested  the
President to consider ordering an  investigation  into  the  possibility  of
realistically bringing the  date  for  the  normalisation  of  crime  levels
compared to international standards forward to the end of 2005,  instead  of
the end of 2009. This will of course entail a proper analysis as to what  is
required by the different departments  and  those  departments  involved  in
poverty relief, because we will only be able  to  sustain  lower  levels  of
crime if we also succeed in effectively addressing poverty.

In his reply to the debate, the hon the President said that he  agreed  with
me that we could shorten the periods which  were  mentioned  by  the  Deputy
President. He continued to say that he could not see why we should not,  and
he said that he was of the opinion that we should have a look  at  that.  He
also said that he was not quite  sure  what  was  meant  by  ``international
levels'' and referred to the  fact  that  London,  for  instance,  had  much
higher rates of car theft than South Africa, and that  there  are  countries
in Western Europe that have higher rates of car hijacking than we have.

One of the very first questions that  we  have  to  find  an  answer  to  is
therefore: what is meant by the ``normalisation of crime levels compared  to
international standards'', as per the answer from the Deputy  President?  In
other words, exactly what is it that we want to achieve by 2009, in  respect
of the levels of crime and what we want to bring forward now?

The one thing that we know is that our present levels of  crime,  especially
in respect of violent crime, are still unacceptably high.  We  have  already
succeeded in stabilising the crime levels  of  most  serious  crime  in  our
country, even before 2003. We have succeeded in reaching that already.

The other thing that we know is that crime is costing our  country  and  our
economy many billions of rands, both in direct costs  as  well  as  indirect
costs - not to talk about the many innocent  lives  lost  and  the  terrible
human suffering and hardship to thousands of South Africans.  However,  what
we do not know, is the exact extent of  the  direct  and  indirect  monetary
costs to our economy. People come up with different amounts, but no one  can
tell us exactly what it is costing our economy.

The other fact which we know is that there  is  a  widely  held  perception,
especially overseas, that South Africa is an unsafe country  in  respect  of
personal safety and security, and that corruption is rife. This  is  usually
given by them as one of the most  important  reasons  we  do  not  get  more
direct investment from the international business world, and also why we  do
not get more tourists, in spite of all our other plus factors.

The high level of crime is also given as one of the main reasons for the so-
called brain drain, why we ultimately cannot succeed  in  getting  a  higher
growth rate for our economy and why  we  cannot  succeed  in  creating  more
employment opportunities.
Yet we do not know how much more direct investment  we  may  get,  how  many
more tourists may come and how much more our  economy  will  grow,  and  how
many more job opportunities we will be able to create if we succeed, to  use
the Deputy President's words, ``in normalising our  crime  levels  according
to international standards''.

On the other hand, we have huge shortages in respect of both  equipment  and
properly trained personnel in all our criminal justice departments,  because
of budgetary constraints. We are  all  aware  of  this  and  this  has  been
referred to many a time.

Has the time not arrived for us to tackle  all  these  unanswered  questions
head-on and to get answers to all these uncertainties? Here I  mean  answers
also from those abroad who come up with this as - I do not want  to  say  an
excuse - a reason for not investing more in our country.  Once  we  know  in
monetary terms what crime is costing South  Africa  annually,  and  once  we
know what it  will  cost  to  address  all  these  shortages,  and  what  is
required, and what it will cost to bring forward the date as  mentioned,  we
will be in a much better position to make informed decisions as to  what  is
required.
Has the time not come for us to ask the G8 countries what  it  is  then,  in
respect of crime levels, that they require for this not to be  a  factor  in
considering direct investment in our country? What is  it  that  they  want?
Let us go to them and ask them. Then they should  also  say  if  we  achieve
that, what is the extent to which they will  then  be  prepared  to  invest?
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms C SEOPOSENGWE (Northern Cape): Mr Chairperson, hon members, delegates  to
the NCOP, allow me to confirm that our police service, the one that we  have
fought for and struggled for so hard, is surely taking shape. We are  indeed
beginning to see a police service that identifies  with  the  needs  of  the
communities which they serve, one that identifies with  the  principle  that
the police is the community, and the community is the police. The  principle
is: Police from the community, through the community, for the community.

It is therefore evident that, apart from the criminal element, which  is  in
the minority anyway, the majority of our people are law-abiding citizens  of
this country,  and  are  indeed  supporting  our  members  in  blue  who  so
tirelessly strive to render our communities safe, secure and crime-free.

I would like to congratulate the police in  our  province  for  a  job  well
done. Hon members should watch the news tonight. This is a clear message  to
those who come to our province to steal the minerals and  the  royalties  of
our poor communities in the middle of the night. The Northern Cape is a  no-
go area for ``diamantsmokkelaars'' [diamond smugglers]. If someone wants  to
buy diamonds, there are procedures for do so. With respect to  the  Kua  and
Khwe communities, I want to report to  this  House  that  the  situation  is
under control and a suspect will be apprehended soon.

It is members of this police service who have rid,  and  who  will  continue
with their endeavours to rid, provinces of the criminal element  and  remain
committed to providing a  quality  service  that  meets  the  needs  of  our
communities.

The police service is  giving  priority  attention  to  the  improvement  of
service delivery to the communities in all  provinces  by  focusing  on  the
eight Batho Pele principles.

In the Northern Cape emphasis is placed on the  five  priority  stations  of
Galeshewe - which is also the provincial presidential station  -  Kimberley,
Roodepan, Upington and Pabalello.

Progress in some of the priority areas  identified  for  improvement  is  as
follows. All visible policing  vehicles  were  clearly  marked.  Area  crime
intelligence teams were expanded and individuals co-opted  to  the  priority
stations. Notice boards were put up in community service centres to  improve
communication and information-sharing with the  community.  Flexi-hours  are
being worked to overcome shortages in human  resources  during  peak  hours.
Administrative personnel  and  management  teams  regularly  do  operational
duties in high-crime areas. The capacity and competencies  of  investigators
are being enhanced through coaching and mentorship by means  of  inspections
and training. Three hundred and eighty-four investigators  were  exposed  to
in-service  training  and  10  detectives  received  formal  training.   One
thousand  three  hundred  and  sixty-nine  reservists   operate   as   force
multipliers, and are being utilised where stations experience a shortage  of
personnel. These reservists worked a total of  368  688  hours  and  made  a
total of 9 927 arrests.
Satellite police  stations  are  functioning  in  Kagisho,  Koopmansfontein,
Nonzwakazi, Hutchinson, Kakamas,  Louisvale  and  Oranjeweg.  A  new  police
station at Oranjeweg is under construction and will be upgraded to  a  fully
fledged station upon completion. We are proud to report that 20  members  of
the police service who work in the community  service  centres  and  in  the
child protection unit will be trained in  sign  language  to  enhance  their
communication skills in serving  communities.  We  hope  to  roll  out  this
training intervention to other stations in the province.

A service delivery improvement best practice that  is  worth  mentioning  is
the restructuring of the detective service, aimed at improving  the  success
rate in the  policing  of  crime  priorities,  which  are  organised  crime,
serious  and  violent  crimes,  crimes  against  women  and  children,   and
enhancing service delivery at  station  level.  Eighteen  specialised  units
were closed and ninety-six members were affected by  the  closure  of  these
units. These members were transferred to  the  newly  established  detective
units or to stations.

I am afraid that despite the tremendous progress made  nationally  in  terms
of racial and gender representativity in the ranks of the  SAPS,  I  am  not
and cannot be proud when it comes to reporting on the SAPS's performance  in
addressing the issue of racial and gender representativity in  the  Northern
Cape.

Little progress has been made in the Northern Cape in regard  to  this  area
of the transformation process. Managers at  all  levels,  including  station
and unit level, are mostly white and  male.  While  racial  representativity
has indeed been achieved at top level, with  two  of  the  three  provincial
commissioners and all area commissioners being black,  one  wonders  whether
it is sheer coincidence that all of them are male, as are  all  but  one  of
the provincial component heads.

I am also concerned that SAPS management in the province does  not  seem  to
be very concerned about this state of  affairs  and  when  confronted  often
shrugs their responsibility off with a ``they don't qualify in terms of  the
promotion policy'' or ``they don't apply''.  The  ``they'',  almost  without
exception, refers to either blacks  or  females,  and  in  particular  black
females.

Any manager worth her or his weight will know that it is the  responsibility
of management to continually assess the appropriateness,  effectiveness  and
efficiency of policy in the context of its responsibility and control  area,
in order to make the necessary amends.

It therefore is unacceptable for police management in the province  to  hide
behind national policy that is clearly not appropriate and effective in  the
Northern  Cape  and  continues   to   disadvantage   the   very   previously
disadvantaged sectors of our workforce. Out of 85  stations,  we  have  only
five or six which are managed by women, and those women are  all  white  for
that matter.

It is the duty and  the  responsibility  of  management,  not  only  in  the
interest  of  those  disadvantaged  members,  but  also  to  adhere  to  the
Constitution and related  labour  legislation,  to  begin  to  do  something
drastic to attend to this issue.

As Government representing the will of the people,  as  expressed  in  their
vote for a democratic state based on the values  of  equality,  nonracialism
and nonsexism, amongst others, we cannot and shall not tolerate a  situation
where our struggles  are  undermined  by  individuals  who  are  failing  to
redress and correct damages caused by the apartheid past.

The urgency of the need for a safer and more secure environment,  especially
against the backdrop of the new form of violence, against  particularly  our
children, that is ravaging our country, cannot be overlooked.

Though  SAPS  statistics  showed  a  decline   in   reported   rape   cases,
specifically in the Northern Cape, to us one rape is  still  one  too  many.
The ordeal of baby Tshepang will forever stay engraved on  our  minds.  This
was one of the worst, if not the worst, most ghastly human act ever  in  the
province.

Another recent incident that sent shock waves through the  country  was  the
one in which two toddlers were allegedly poisoned by their  own  stepfather,
simply because he was angry at the mother. These  heinous  acts  once  again
confirm the argument that crimes such as rape, domestic violence  and  child
abuse cannot be policed with any measure of success by the criminal  justice
agencies acting alone.

It is furthermore important to accept the unfortunate  reality  that  sexual
offences and domestic  violence  are  difficult  to  police  and  prosecute,
precisely because of the intimate nature of these crimes and the process  of
giving and gathering evidence. From this flows the need  for  the  different
stakeholders and role-players in the province  to  work  in  a  co-ordinated
team, not only internally, but also externally, to pool  resources  together
to ensure a greater and more lasting impact  on  the  levels  of  crime  and
violence in our province.

Nevertheless, we want to affirm that the plight of victims of  crime,  abuse
and violence has always  been  a  priority  for  this  Government,  and  the
departments and agencies involved in the criminal justice  sphere.  This  is
evidenced by the large number of initiatives mentioned in the report  issued
by  the  Ministry  of  Justice  in  response  to  the  human  rights  report
undertaking  to  ensure  that  the  criminal  justice  system  becomes  more
effective, efficient and victim sensitive.

Of particular importance is the best practice that was followed in the  baby
Tshepang  investigation  by  the  police  through  the  establishment  of  a
multiskilled task team of experienced investigators and  support  personnel,
which led to the arrest of the suspect. This approach is also proving to  be
very effective in the policing and  investigation  of  organised  crime  and
farm attacks in the province.

A number of special projects were launched in the Northern Cape  to  address
crimes of violence against women, and we will intensify our  actions  during
the current financial year.

During the past financial year we embarked on a project  aimed  at  changing
the face  and  image  of  the  police  station  to  victim-friendly  service
centres. This project, known as ``Project  Comfort'',  was  launched  at  15
police stations in our province to establish and equip victim comfort  rooms
next to the community service centres, from where victims  and  complainants
of sexual and domestic violence must be served.

The Swedish government has also contributed in this regard by assisting  the
police through Swedish Project Number 8 to establish a further  five  victim
comfort or support rooms at the five priority stations, that is,  Galeshewe,
Roodepan, Kimberley, Pabalelo and Upington.
In conclusion, to ensure  proper  and  successful  investigation  of  crimes
against women and children, the four regional child  protection  units  have
been  further  capacitated  through  the  restructuring  of  the   detective
services. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the approach of Government to combat the  scourge
of crime in an integrated and holistic manner is the correct one. Every law-
abiding South African wants to see the Departments of Safety  and  Security,
Justice and of Correctional Services win the war against crime.

The Department of Justice has made great strides in the development  of  its
budget   process.   The   process   is   comprehensive,   transparent    and
understandable. One of the important problems  that  the  budgeting  process
highlights is that the department will  not  have  the  funds  to  implement
certain contemplated Acts of Parliament  within  the  MTEF  period.  Here  I
speak of the Legal Practice Bill and the Child Justice Bill. There  are,  of
course, others set out in the department's documentation as well.

We need to ask ourselves, as members of Parliament: Should we be  processing
these Bills when the resources to  implement  them  will  not  be  available
during the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework period? Should we not be  using
the resources that the department has available to ensure that  the  systems
that are already in place are properly resourced  and  operate  efficiently?
Would it not be better to ensure that all magistrates'  courts  have  proper
facilities to  accommodate  and  cater  for  minor  complainants  before  we
consider new legislation?

Another difficulty is that there appears to be insufficient funds to  create
all  the  necessary  posts  for  the  maintenance  investigators  needed  to
properly implement  the  relevant  legislation.  Overall,  it  appears  that
whilst progress has been made, the Department of Justice still has some  way
to go before it can be said to have overhauled its operations.

The hon the Minister in the Department  of  Correctional  Services  has  the
misfortune that this debate occurs the  day  after  the  Special  Assignment
exposÃ© on corruption in Grootvlei  Prison.  While  the  Jali  commission  is
sitting to investigate the issue of corruption in prisons, I do not wish  to
sensationalise the issue. Suffice it  to  say  that  all  law-abiding  South
Africans were horrified to see the scenes portrayed on the video.  We  trust
that  the  Jali  commission  will  establish  the  precise  extent  of   the
corruption in prisons.

All  law-abiding  South  Africans  will  want  to  make   a   positive   and
constructive contribution to rooting out corruption in the prison  services.
It is in that spirit that I make the  following  suggestions.  Firstly,  all
minors who are in  prisons  should  be  moved  to  prisons  in  a  different
geographical location from an ordinary prison. I would urge the Minister  to
consider the feasibility of reserving a prison for underage offenders,  even
if it means relocating other prisoners. Underage prisoners who are  awaiting
trial  should  not  be  exposed  to  the  prison  system  unless  there  are
compelling reasons to do so.

Secondly, I would urge the hon the Minister to investigate  the  feasibility
of removing cash from circulation in the prison system. Any  cash  belonging
to an inmate can be kept on his or her behalf,  to  be  returned  when  they
leave prison. If one reads  the  book  Cold  Stone  Jug  by  Herman  Charles
Bosman, one will see that corruption has existed in  South  African  prisons
for many years. The officer commanding the Grootvlei Prison took  corruption
seriously and tried to do something to expose it and bring it to an  end.  I
hope that this fact will be taken into account  when  his  own  position  is
considered.

The nature of the institution of a prison has  a  corrupting  influence.  We
need to review the conditions of employment of warders to  ensure  that  the
temptation is reduced as far as  is  possible,  and  warders  who  yield  to
corruption need to face the full weight of the law.

The Department of Safety and Security has consistently  lost  manpower  over
the past few years. Positive  steps  have  been  taken  to  counteract  this
trend. Over the next three years, approximately 25Â 100 new  police  officers
will be trained, which will compensate for the loss  by  attrition  and  see
the force grow by approximately  16Â 000  persons.  Nevertheless,  there  are
still certain structural problems. There are too  few  people  carrying  out
visible policing and too  many  locked  into  administrative  duties.  [Time

Ms D P MAGADZI (Northern Province): Chairperson and hon  members,  with  our
hearts and souls still sore after the untimely death of the greatest son  of
South Africa, we are converged here in this hallowed  House  to  debate  the
budget of the Justice cluster. His contribution to  enriching  the  national
debates will be missed by friends and adversaries alike.

On a positive note, I would also like to join the rest  of  the  country  in
wishing our President a belated happy birthday.

The budget that we are considering here today constitutes  one  of  the  key
pillars of democracy in South Africa,  a  reflection  of  the  work  of  the
Departments of Safety  and  Security,  Justice,  Correctional  Services  and
Defence.

It is my pleasure at the same time to  join  the  rest  of  the  country  in
wishing our newly appointed Minister of Safety and Security success  in  his
tenure. Like the rest of the  progressive  forces  in  this  country,  I  am
convinced that he will be able to live up to the expectations of the  people
of South Africa  in  dealing  with  criminality,  while  at  the  same  time
continuing to do the good work that his predecessors had started.

In his budget  speech,  Minister  Nqakula  alluded  to  the  possibility  of
enlisting 7 100 new police officers, with the  projections  of  28  560  new
personnel during the present MTEF  cycle.  The  enlisting  of  these  police
officers will indeed go a long way in ensuring that as a country we  are  on
top of crime and that indeed we are committed to ensuring  that  the  people
of South Africa can live in peace and harmony. At the same time this  intake
should take into consideration that provinces such as ours have a  ratio  of
1 police officer to 700 people. This anomaly needs correction.

Concerns have been raised over the past few weeks around  the  situation  at
the University of the North, especially the burning down of  the  university
buildings. In this light, I have personally joined  the  operations  of  the
SANDF, the SA Police Service, the campus protection unit, and the  municipal
protection services to raid the university in search  of  criminal  elements
using the campus as their  operational  base.  While  operations  are  still
continuing, we have started seeing the results of the efforts of  these  men
and women by virtue of the arrests that have been made. Several persons  are
facing charges, ranging from  public  violence  to  theft,  trespassing  and
arson. We have started setting up a sector policing unit on the  campus,  as
well as a subforum. The mobile station will be on the campus  from  time  to
time, as part of crime prevention.

In the Vhembe district we are faced with a number of challenges due  to  the
unresolved  cases  of  ritual  murder.  This  has  led  to  an   uprise   by
communities, in particular the youth. We appreciate  the  fact  that  people
are making follow-ups on pending cases, but at the same time  this  must  be
done in an orderly manner. Children  below  the  age  of  13  were  used  to
blockade the roads, and we saw many criminal activities  being  carried  out
by these young men and women, vandalising property as people  were  passing,
opening ``tollgates'' and charging people passing the road  blockades.  This
must be  condemned,  because  our  children  must  be  allowed  to  grow  as
children. Once more, let me  extend  my  appreciation  to  the  SA  National
Defence Force for the human and material support that they provided.

Our province will be convening a summit on rape. Possible stakeholders  will
be invited to this summit, which will be addressed by prominent speakers  to
add impetus to Government's commitment to lending a hand  to  bettering  the
lives of people, and particularly women. The convening of this summit  is  a
response to the increasing number of child rape cases, in particular in  our
province. Research has also been conducted on woman and child abuse  in  the
area of Bolobedu. The causes of these ghastly acts have  been  outlined  and
we believe that with the assistance of  other  stakeholders,  in  particular
other  Government  departments,  we  shall  be   able   to   implement   the
recommendations fully.

The  advent  of  people-centred  governance  has  brought   with   it   many
experiences in respect of partnerships being developed  between  communities
and public institutions. In the SA Police Service we have  community  police
forums to assist with policing. The judiciary has established  a  system  of
lay assessors to assist them with judgments. We also have the  commandos  in
the  SA  National  Defence  Force.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  community
involvement in assisting the prosecution with its work, notwithstanding  the
fact that the prosecution is regarded as the community's lawyers  in  court,
whose main responsibility is to protect the interests of the community.

The prosecution in our province is currently engaged in discussion that  may
result in the establishment of a forum for community  participation  in  the
work of the prosecution authorities.

In  his  budget  speech,  the  Minister  for  Justice   and   Constitutional
Development reported that a 75%  success  rate  had  been  achieved  by  the
Saturday  and  additional  courts  that  were  established  throughout   the
country. Allow me to add my  voice  to  those  who  have  congratulated  the
judicial officers for the good work that has  been  done  in  ensuring  that
justice is meted out within the shortest possible time, and to  express  the
hope that this work will continue as it has already.

In the not-so-distant future, our province will  be  one  of  the  provinces
which will be receiving the High Court. The establishment of this new  court
will go a long way in dealing with cases that need the attention of  a  high
court. Previously we used to go to the Pretoria High  Court,  owing  to  the
lack of such an important facility in the province. I also want  to  express
my appreciation to the Department of Justice  for  this  good  gesture  that
they have shown to our province.

We consider ourselves  fortunate  in  the  Northern  Province  in  that  the
Ministry of Correctional Services has found it fitting to  house  a  private
correctional facility in this province, within the spirit of  public-private
partnership  in  the  provision  of   services   to   the   community.   The
establishment of Sinthumule-Kutama Correctional Centre is likely  to  assist
in enhancing  our  ability  to  effectively  rehabilitate  offenders  in  an
environment conducive to effective rehabilitation.

My visit  to  the  correctional  services  centre  has  highlighted  several
serious challenges that are facing our juvenile offenders.  The  institution
houses serious and dangerous criminals  together  with  these  juvenile  and
young offenders. In this regard the Department of Correctional Services  may
need to consider building facilities to be used for young offenders,  so  as
to facilitate programmes designed for them specifically.

One of the major challenges facing the Department of  Correctional  Services
is the receipt of sentenced  and  unsentenced  inmates,  some  of  whom  are
suffering from chronic diseases. The officials will discover too  late  that
they have chronic patients who are suffering from, for example,  psychiatric
problems and epilepsy. In the case of a diabetic patient, a person  may  end
up dead before proper medication is  dispensed.  Our  correctional  services
centres are also overpopulated.

The biggest challenge facing us is how to deal  with  the  problems  we  are
faced with in these institutions. This has led to what we saw  yesterday  on
Special Assignment. The vision of a criminal justice system that is  people-
centred and responsive to the needs of the people is a vision  that  all  of
us should strive for, for the Government is on course in lending  a  helping
hand to provide a better life to our people.

With the support and co-operation of our communities  in  the  execution  of
justice, we will definitely take criminal justice a step higher, and  create
a balance between the rights and the responsibilities of the people  of  our
beautiful land, South Africa. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon MECs and hon members, not  only
does the ANC believe that peace and  stability  are  essential  requirements
for the successful social, economic  and  political  transformation  of  our
country, it has also taken the lead in galvanising all  sectors  of  society
in a campaign  to  restore  peace  and  stability.  The  ANC's  approach  to
fighting crime is based  on  the  understanding  that  there  is  no  single
overriding cause for crime; therefore there can never be a single solution.

The fight against crime requires an  all-encompassing  approach  which  must
involve all four  pillars  of  our  criminal  justice  system,  as  well  as
communities. The fight against crime demands  an  integrated  approach  that
tackles  both  the  criminal  justice  system,  and   economic   and   human
development at the same time. Any other approach is doomed to fail.

A  critical  element  of  the  ANC's  safety  and  security  policy  is  the
involvement of our communities. We  believe  that  communities  must  become
active participants, if we are to make our areas safe for  our  children  to
play in, for people to work and for communities to  be  involved  in  social
activities. For  them  to  play  a  meaningful  role,  communities  must  be
empowered to  enable  them  to  participate  fully  in  all  decision-making
processes regarding community policing forums. To  this  end,  the  ANC  has
resolved to expand the role of community policing forums to ensure  adequate
participation by communities in these forums.

Furthermore, the ANC will work towards creating the  necessary  dispensation
to  enable  community  policing  forums  to  have  greater  influence   over
management and policy-making  processes  on  community  safety  issues.  The
involvement of youth in the fight to create  safer  communities  is  another
important facet of the ANC's safety and security strategy.  To  counter  the
appeal which criminal gangs have for our  youth  as  a  provider  of  social
cohesion, the ANC  is  engaging  our  youth  to  participate  in  anti-crime
campaigns. We are  also  providing  youth  with  an  alternative  lifestyle,
through the development of skills so that they can  contribute  meaningfully
to the reconstruction and development of our country.

Crime is a real problem, and the ANC acknowledges this. However, it  is  not
a problem unique to South Africa. Indeed,  compared  to  countries  such  as
Australia, Switzerland and Denmark, South Africa is relatively safe. I  have
learned  that   statistics   from   Interpol,   the   International   Police
Organisation, indicate that a person is  more  likely  to  be  assaulted  in
Australia, that Denmark has the highest rate of theft, and  that  a  car  is
more likely to be stolen in Switzerland. Under  the  capable  leadership  of
the Minister of Safety and Security, and  his  very  able  predecessor,  the
late Comrade Steve Tshwete, the ANC has been able to turn the fight  against
crime into a national campaign, in which all sectors  of  our  society  have
become engaged.

Our national campaign against crime is so successful that we are one of  the
safest countries in the world for tourists to  travel  to,  according  to  a
university survey of 150 tour operators  in  countries  which  included  the
USA, Britain, Germany and France. To assist my colleague  here,  I  want  to
refer him to an article published on 12 May 2002, under the heading  ``South
Africa voted safe, tourists pour in as perceptions  change  after  September
11.''

Our strategy in terms of dealing with children in conflict with the law  has
also been praised as one of the best in the world by a UN representative  at
a recent conference on children in conflict with  the  law.  If  the  global
community regards South Africa as one of the safest destinations  to  travel
to, then there  must  be  some  other  motive  behind  the  claims  by  some
political parties that the ANC is not doing enough to combat crime.

We do not want people to deny that crime is a problem. What we want is  some
patriotism and objectivity. How often do people read about actions taken  by
Government  to  address  overcrowding  in  prisons  and  to  address   court
backlogs? How often are people made aware of the mechanisms  that  exist  to
address violence  against  women  and  children?  We  have  heard  from  the
Ministers about their plans further to improve our criminal justice  system.
What we need is for all South  Africans  to  realise  that  negativity  will
bring us nowhere.

Instead  of  complaining,  opposition   parties   should   encourage   their
supporters to embrace  the  transformation  that  is  taking  place  in  our
criminal justice system, and find real ways of how they,  too,  can  play  a
role  in  the  reconstruction  and  further  development  of  our   country.
[Interjections.]  The  ANC  is  aware  of  the  complexities   involved   in
transforming the police service. There are still police members  who  resist
transformation. In some instances, we still have a  skewed  distribution  of
police resources.

Compared to what the situation was before 1994, we can be very proud of  our
achievements thus far. With the current budget we will be able to  build  on
these achievements, through the  allocation  of  appropriate  resources,  to
accelerate the process of transformation within the police  service.  We  of
the ANC support the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVO[Ã«]L: Chairperson, on  a  point  of  order:  I  think  it  is
irresponsible, it is irresponsible and unparliamentary, and  out  of  order,
for a member to hang a cap on the microphone of the House, as  Mr  Raju  has
done. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Let  us  leave
the Minister of Defence to deal with that. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:  Chairperson,  for  some  of  us  it  is  always  a
privilege to come back to this House, and take part in the  debates  of  the
National Council of Provinces. I would like  to  remind  the  House  of  the
priorities that we shared with the NCOP at  the  time  of  the  budget  last
year.

First of all, we pointed out that we  would  continue  to  maintain  a  core
force that was able to meet its commitments, and to deal with a  wide  range
of contingencies, a force that had the capacity to expand to an  appropriate
size, when necessary, and would be able to mount peace  support  operations,
provide support to the SA Police Service, and  support  to  social  delivery
programmes.

I am happy to announce that to date our performance has met that  challenge.
As I speak to  the  House  this  afternoon,  we  have  deployed,  under  the
auspices of the United Nations, 930  members  of  the  SA  National  Defence
Force, covering a wide range of tasks, including military liaison  officers,
military observers, staff officers, specialised teams, protection  services,
and general military assistance.

Members of the SA  National  Defence  Force  are  deployed  in  Uganda,  the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Algeria,  the  Comoros  and
Burundi. They are also participating in SADC initiatives to render  planning
assistance in various projects. We were heavily involved, for  instance,  in
the Lesotho election  process.  At  the  same  time  we  have  continued  to
maintain support for the SA  Police  Service  inside  the  country,  working
together with our cluster departments.

The second challenge that we tabled at the time was that  of  the  alignment
of policy and budget. Quite often Parliament determines  what  needs  to  be
done, but the resources available  to  the  executive  are  not  necessarily
sufficient and abundant, so we have to take action to deal  with  this.  The
mismatch between defence  policy  and  our  Defence  budget  allocation  has
forced us to re-examine our overall  strategy,  with  the  aim  of  becoming
affordable whilst still being able to deliver an effective Defence Force.

What this means is that we cannot change policy once  it  is  determined  by
Parliament. But within the parameters  of  determined  policy,  we  have  to
deploy the resources allocated to us year after year, to  be  able  to  meet
those obligations that we have, and cannot allow  to  lapse.  That  we  have
been able to do successfully.

When the departmental services and divisions drew up a  force  structure  to
meet the needs determined by  our  policy  overall,  we  found  that  if  we
budgeted for everything that we needed to deal  with,  the  budget  required
would have been R4,1 billion.

That meant we had to review that, so as to be able, in the current year,  to
maintain those capabilities, and to fulfil  the  obligations  required  with
the limited budget that we had.

Some hard decisions have to be made in the coming period, and  the  proposal
to enable us to build steadily year after year will be taken to Cabinet  and
Parliament before we implement it. In the course of this year, we will  have
to do that.

The third challenge continues to be that of absorption  of  new  technology,
both in the light of the new strategic defence package and in the  light  of
competing in the world in which we find ourselves.  We  have  to  raise  our
facilities, our equipment and so on and the training of our staff has to  be
commensurate with  the  technological  advancements  of  our  day.  The  new
technology embodied  in  the  weapon  system  being  delivered  through  the
strategic defence  package  impacts  on  every  aspect  of  defence  -  from
technical  training  to  human  resource  planning,  to  maintenance,  to  a
provisioning system, to a new infrastructure and storage.

Consequently, we have a number of young South Africans at the present  time,
black and white,  located  in  various  centres,  some  in  Europe  and  the
Americas, training and getting ready to bring  the  necessary  skills  home.
The chief of the navy and the air force have been working for  the  past  18
months on plans to accommodate and absorb this new equipment.

The fourth challenge is the need to develop capacity to respond  effectively
to our changing regional situation. No one last  year  at  this  time  would
have anticipated that Angola would be busy with the  peace  process  now  in
place in that country. None of us could have anticipated or  predicted  that
the DRC Sun City talks would take place and move in the direction  in  which
they are moving. This is a very fluid situation in our region.

The tensions, the problems and the challenges raised  by  Zimbabwe's  recent
elections; the threat of hunger and starvation  in  countries  like  Malawi,
Zambia and so on are all dangers and disasters which South  Africa,  through
the National Defence Force, must always be ready  to  respond  to  when  the
right moment comes. That means, of course,  that  the  SA  National  Defence
Force has  to  be  strong,  but  flexible  enough  to  meet  any  unforeseen
challenge that arises. I am happy to report that the National Defence  Force
is responding most effectively and capably in relation to this challenge.

The fifth and final challenge, one which impacts directly  on  our  domestic
situation,  is  to  qualitatively  increase  the  capacity  of  the  Defence
Secretariat. Hon members will recall that the  ministerial  inquiry  set  up
after the  Tempe  problems  revealed  some  serious  weaknesses  within  the
Defence Secretariat. We have  now  -  and  I  can  say  this  with  pride  -
responded systematically and concretely to some of  the  challenges  raised.
Appointments which have been made, principally that  of  the  chief  finance
officer within the Defence Secretariat, have eliminated  a  whole  range  of
problems that were generating tension in terms of failure  to  pay  salaries
on time, discrimination between former members of the  SADF  as  opposed  to
the others who came from the nonstatutory forces, and so on.  I  can  report
with pride that the levels of tension that existed in  September  1999  that
led to Tempe, that led to FSAI and to the Phalaborwa shootings and  killings
have been eliminated and a great improvement has taken place.

That does not mean that there are no difficulties. We must understand  that.
There continue to be problems. I am sure that hon members  read  the  recent
report about how two able-bodied seamen shot and  killed  each  other.  This
was purely a  boyfriend-girlfriend  affair.  It  had  nothing  to  with  the
operations as they stand. Hon members will find a number of  incidents  like
that. Generally, when these incidents are  reported,  the  picture  that  is
cast by the media is that they have to do with operations, but  I  can  give
hon members the clear assurance this afternoon that most of those  incidents
now, except one that happened in Burundi - and I can deal with  the  details
of that at a later stage because that  matter  is  now  sub  judice  -  have
purely been either acts of crime or of personal tension between people  such
as individuals who may be quarrelling about something, but they are  not  to
do with structural organisational problems.

We continue, of course, to have difficulties. The middle layers  of  the  SA
National Defence Force continue to be heavily dominated by  white  officers,
and  that  middle  layer  strata  is  where,  in  fact,  one  employs  one's
resources. The rank and file, on the other hand, is dominated by  the  black
sections of the population. Therefore, when the orders are  given  by  white
officers to black troopers and  so  on,  it  is  natural  in  that  kind  of
situation that there should be a bit of discord. But, compared to  what  the
situation was at the beginning  of  last  year  to  the  present  time,  the
improvement is immense.

With regard to the air force, I think we have began to  break  the  backbone
of the resistance to transformation and the same can be said with regard  to
the navy. The numbers remain weak, but  I  must  tell  this  House  that  to
produce a fully trained, capable able-bodied seaperson  -  man  or  woman  -
takes many years. If it could be done overnight, we would be the first  ones
to do so. It takes a lot of time and resources. Many of the  young  men  and
women of our country who will undergo this transformation are now either  in
our own academies here or in academies in  other  countries.  When  they  do
come back, there will be a manner in which we will transform  things  fairly
fast.

I must take members into my confidence on this  question.  The  SA  military
health services are, as I am standing here, short of more than 100 budgeted-
for medical doctors. We are laying emphasis, in  terms  of  the  recruitment
stage, on filling the more than 100 posts by doctors, men  and  women,  from
black communities, either on a full-time or a part-time basis. They  can  do
the work in their own practices,  but  come  in  periodically.  To  get  the
message deep  into  communities  in  order  for  people  to  appreciate  the
importance of this is not easy. We have inherited communities,  particularly
black communities, for whom National Defence Force service  is  regarded  as
carrying a firearm and standing on a street corner, ready to  shoot  anybody
who look like they are going to throw a stone. Unfortunately,  that  is  not
what defence is about.

No institution requires capabilities and technical training  more  than  the
National Defence Force. We need engineers - mechanical and  civil  engineers
- doctors, psychologists and  traumatologists.  We  need  the  most  trained
people, even for our pilots. One looks for trained people everywhere.  Today
when the United Nations needs men and  women  who  are  technically  trained
south of the equator - whether there is a bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, or  Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania - there is only  one  country  with  the  capability  to
supply technically trained men and women, and it is this country.

With regard to the DRC the UN asked that we not give them foot  soldiers  as
they had all the countries of Africa ready to deploy men and women  who  can
stand on a corner with a gun. They needed  technical  people,  communication
experts, medical doctors, engineers - anything technical one can  think  of.
Large numbers of young South Africans need to be taking advantage of  coming
into the National Defence Force, because we  have  set  aside  part  of  the
budget to send them to universities, technikons  and  so  on,  so  that  the
National Defence Force, and therefore this country, does not  run  short  of
human resources to meet its obligations in relation to  our  neighbours  and
our continent. Once those people are qualified, and at a time when they  are
not needed, we will civilianise them. They will then take those skills  into
our communities, uplift them and make life better.

It  is  our  contribution  to  train  so  that  the  country  can  meet  its
obligations, and to train to meet the needs  of  the  country's  own  social
programmes. The Defence Force is also empowered with men and women  who  are
not only self-disciplined, but are also  able  to  assist  this  country  to
advance into the future and meet the obligations towards the  population  of
this country.
I would like to indicate that we  are  at  the  present  time  making  major
revisions of the SA National Defence Force. Some of the facilities which  we
have, we are going to have to cut down precisely because, as  I  have  said,
as we take in technical know-how, tasks which in the past could be  done  by
many other people,  can  now  be  done  by  fewer  numbers  because  of  the
technical levels that we are raising. We are now converting  some  of  those
and we will be looking to work with the  other  institutions.  Indeed,  this
cluster of Ministers here and the others who are not here,  is  now  working
on a programme to withdraw members of the National Defence Force  from  most
of the civilian functions.  Cabinet  has  taken  a  decision  to  set  up  a
national security agency to take on some of the young men and women who  are
capable, with good records, and so on. We are setting that up,  jointly,  as
this cluster. We will then be able to take over some of the tasks and  allow
for the National Defence Force to  concentrate  on  its  core  business  and
obligations. I am indebted also for the collaboration and the joint  efforts
that we are putting together with our colleagues in the cluster  to  advance
this.

The final point that I would like to make is that we are very  grateful  for
the work that was done by Parliament  in  reviewing  the  whole  controversy
around the strategic defence package acquisition. Apart  from  the  findings
of the four agencies, we are now in a position to report  that  the  counter
trades that were negotiated  are  yielding  incredible  advantages  for  the
country. Whilst we buy with rands, the negotiated  industrial  participation
agreements are either in rands, pounds or deutschmarks, which  means  bigger
quantities of investments are coming into the  country,  rather  than  going
out. When the rand goes down and the dollar goes up, those dollars that  are
negotiated must remain at that number. Therefore, the  amount  of  resources
flowing into the country is far bigger, and not a loss for this country.

Now, of course, I have to make one last point with regard to  that,  and  it
is that South Africa was isolated for a long time. Even when it came to  the
question of currency exchanges  and  so  on,  we  were  insulated  from  the
international community. Some of the difficulties or  fluctuations  that  we
are facing have to do with the fact that our country is working itself  into
an international market that, until our democratisation, we  were  not  part
of. There is very little for South Africa to be alarmed about.
The trends that have  been  indicated  elsewhere  within  our  economy  show
clearly that we are in fact benefiting, even after the events  of  September
11 last year. If the hon members look at the reports on tourism and  so  on,
the flood or the movement in this direction is big, which  explains  why  we
are negotiating with such urgency the question of a Southern African  mutual
defence pact.

This is the top priority this year - that at the  next  summit  SADC  accept
this. That will send a message  to  the  international  community  that  the
nations of our region are jointly committed to each other's  protection  and
defence; that the conflicts that are now there, that are  being  worked  out
today, cannot replicate themselves, because that mutual defence  pact  makes
it impossible for one Southern African country to  attack  another,  because
all of them are under one agreement.

Therefore, potential investors can come into our  region;  they  can  invest
their money, assured of the fact that Southern  Africa  as  a  community  of
nations is committed to long-term security and stability, that the basis  is
there for them to invest, and that they can be assured that their  resources
will not be wasted. [Applause.]
Mr L  RAMATLAKANE  (Western  Cape):  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,  Ministers,
colleagues and hon members,  I  rise  to  support  the  national  Minister's
budget and the national Minister's efforts to support the strategy to  bring
down crime in the country. I must also say that  the  efforts  of  the  late
Minister Steve Tshwete have seen the stabilising of crime nationally. So  we
are building on that foundation and it will take  us  to  the  normalisation
stage.  I  must  add  that  this  normalisation  stage  requires  that   all
departments integrate their programmes so as to achieve the goals.

The Western Cape government within its strategic policy  framework  directed
its work in terms of the objective to ``contain and eradicate crime  through
good intergovernmental co-operation so that the Western Cape  can  become  a
safe and secure home for all, especially women and children''.

The Western Cape is still faced with  the  challenge  of  dealing  with  the
skewedness of resource allocation between what  I  call  the  violent  crime
area on the one hand and the economic crime area on the other hand. This  is
informed  by  an  exit  poll  survey  which  revealed,  inter   alia,   that
communities have little trust in the police; that there is a  lack  of  case
confidentiality and sensitivity; and a lack of willingness  to  help.  Armed
with this information, I initiated a process to arrest the situation.

With the understanding that constitutional requirements determine  the  role
that one has to play, a Western Cape police indaba was convened on 9 and  10
May to map out the way forward. The indaba discussed an  agreed  on  people-
oriented problem- solving, policing and a community safety strategy for  the
province. The indaba was attended by  about  400  people,  representing  162
police stations, community policing forums from those stations and the  NGOs
associated with policing and or crime prevention.

This strategic plan is  located  within  the  framework  of  the  province's
commitment to fighting crime and  addressing  the  needs  of  the  poor  and
disadvantaged citizens  of  this  province,  recognising  that  by  far  the
largest number of murders in the Western Cape occurs  in  the  poor  African
and coloured townships, and that the poor areas are  hardest  hit  by  crime
and yet these very areas are  still  not  adequately  equipped  with  police
resources and too often still  experience  much  lower  levels  of  policing
services than that in other areas.
Taking into account these police stations  and  priority  crime  areas,  the
strategic plan and discussion concluded that we need to focus on  three  key
areas in the Western Cape: firstly, murder; secondly, organised  crime;  and
thirdly crime against women and children.

The identification of these  priority  areas  does  not  mean  that  general
policing will not take place in the province, but that it is also  aimed  at
focusing on achieving maximum results. Within these three  areas  identified
are key issues of interpersonal  conflict,  shebeens  and  gangsterism  that
require attention, meaning that resources should follow the priorities  that
we determine. I will return to the  gangsterism  issue  on  the  Cape  Flats
shortly.

The conference resolved and directed  that  the  development  of  a  service
charter outlining the responsibilities and obligations  of  the  police  and
the rights of complainants needed to be addressed, and that the date was  to
be finalised by 30 June. This included ensuring that all police stations  in
the province were equipped with trauma rooms by the end  of  December  2002.
The conference also resolved that there be  a  commitment  by  all  to  form
strong partnerships with the communities against  crime  in  order  to  beat
crime.

The indaba prioritised six policing areas  in  which  the  rate  of  murder,
organised crime and violence against women was high,  that  is  Khayelitsha,
Mitchells Plain, Nyanga,  Guguletu,  Kuilsrivier  and  Philippi.  There  was
general acceptance that resources would have to  be  realigned,  reorganised
and/or personnel redeployed to ensure effective police service delivery.

With regard to vigilantism, the indaba condemned it in the  strongest  terms
possible. It was,  in  fact,  agreed  that  the  CPFs  and  other  community
organisations should expose this criminality that purports to represent  the
interests of the communities but violates human rights.

With regard to the priority areas, it is with pride that we  can  report  to
this House that we have  gained  some  ground  with  community  mobilisation
through an antichild abuse campaign, known as ``Hands off our children -  My
child is your child'' or HOOC. This is  a  campaign  that  seeks  to  create
awareness of this sickness  pervading  our  community  and  it  engages  the
community in interventions that  will  see  us  preventing  and  eradicating
crime against women and children.

The outcome, therefore, of  the  indaba  provided  an  opportunity  for  all
police management and community policing  forums  to  refine  their  station
policing plan in line with the objectives and  outcome  of  the  conference.
But this approach does not mean that the policing plan will be  designed  as
a one size fits all plan. It is, of  course,  the  station  plans  that  are
based on station priorities and patterns and on local needs.  To  this  end,
we will meet on Monday, 24 June, with police management to begin to  analyse
the station-by-station plans. They will be  tabled  in  order  that  service
delivery will improve in the province to an acceptable level.

Gang activity, as pointed out by hon Minister Nqakula in his budget  speech,
remains a big challenge in the Western Cape. Sporadic  gangsterism  conflict
spills over into schools, and normal schooling is hampered in  the  process.
The normal lives of various communities are negatively affected,  some  lose
their lives in the process. But communities on the Cape  Flats  continue  to
see gangsterism  as  a  way  of  life,  a  way  of  life  because  for  many
gangsterism is linked  to  their  livelihood.  This  situation  requires  an
integrated measure between  all  spheres  of  government  and  the  relevant
departments to turn the situation around. Further community mobilisation  is
needed, and this mobilisation of communities started when we took over.

While we  acknowledge  the  additional  deployment  of  police  as  part  of
Operation Slasher, which must be appreciated,  the  capacity  of  the  total
force within the context of the withdrawal of the army, used as a backup  to
the SAPS in the gang-ravaged areas, remains a concern. This matter  requires
further attention by the national Ministers of Safety and  Security  and  of
Defence. I would like to  say  to  the  Minister  that  we  acknowledge  the
national Ministry's commitment to allocating an additional 3 200 of the  new
police posts to the Western Cape in order to ensure  that  our  province  is
adequately resourced so that we are able to fight crime. It is my view  that
the resource allocations, as  I  have  indicated  earlier,  to  contain  and
eradicate crime in the Western Cape need further attention.

The other matter of concern is the slowness in  which  we  are  address  the
location of community service centres in the province. It  is  a  fact  that
most of these community policing centres are not  located  within  reach  of
our communities. So our effectiveness would require  that  we  address  this
matter both as the SAPS  and,  of  course,  as  the  national  Public  Works
Department. However, we must cut down on the length of time taken to  design
and construct these services.

The transformation of the police and police management remains  a  challenge
to be overcome. I can depend, of course, in terms of the transformation,  on
the Minister and the national Commissioner in  that  the  situation  in  the
Western Cape in terms of transformation should change. I want  to  emphasise
that the question of reorientation of the police in  the  province  will  be
receiving attention in time to come.

In the context of transformation, I want to raise the matter  of  corruption
in the police, but stress that for the  good  of  policing  we  must  always
isolate culprits from the good policewomen and policemen out there  to  whom
we remain indebted as a country.

Our demonstration of zero tolerance spoke volumes when  the  police  captain
based in Philippi  was  found  to  be  using  or  issuing  gun  licences  to
gangsters and/or gang leaders. When a  captain  and  inspectors  were  found
poaching abalone in Gansbaai action was taken  against  them.  All  in  all,
about 34 police members have received varying forms  of  punishment  in  the
time we are speaking about in the interests of  the  good  name  of  the  SA
Police Service.

With regard to Correctional Services, suffice it to say  -  because  of  the
time limit - that the issue of corruption in  the  centres  requires  urgent
attention, for instance how inmates are  handled  and  all  sorts  of  other
issues. Of major concern is that while we are making every effort and  doing
everything possible to bring  back  the  elements  of  peace,  security  and
stability to the province, political parties such as the DP, or  the  DA  as
it is referred to, keep hampering our morale-boosting efforts in the  Police
Service  by  continuing  to  insult  communities  by   making   inflammatory
statements about the police. We call on  them  to  stop  this  childish  and
dangerous behaviour.

Lastly, I would like to agree fully with President  Mbeki's  statement  when
he spoke in the National Assembly yesterday, and I quote:


  Arising from this come the challenges of drugs and gangsterism.  In  this
  regard, we have to pay even closer attention to the calls of the youth on
  the Cape Flats to assist their communities to rid themselves of the  twin
  problems of drug abuse and gangsterism.

We are ready, in terms of our co-operative  Government  commitment,  to  put
into action the statement of  the  President  without  delay,  so  that  the
Western Cape can become a secure home for all its people,  especially  women
and children.

In conclusion, the Western Cape is ready to move forward  with  the  efforts
of the national Minister to bring crime down and normalise society.  We  are
confident that while this  demand  from  each  of  us  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr P D  N  MALOYI:  Chairperson,  Ministers,  MECs,  permanent  and  special
delegates, ladies and gentlemen, we are meeting  here  today  once  more  to
debate how to accelerate the mammoth task of solidifying the  foundation  of
our democratic order. We have a duty to work tirelessly to ensure  that  our
nation is transformed into a truly nonracial, nonsexist and  united  country
which is at peace with itself.

Amongst many challenges confronting us is the successful  transformation  of
the justice system. We have to spend  greater  effort  in  intensifying  our
campaign to transform the justice system on the basis that problems  in  the
justice system have the potential to reverse all the gains we made since  we
took power in 1994. I must immediately say here that I  hold  no  brief  for
the Minister or his department, but if we take a closer  look  at  the  work
they have done since 1994, our faces should be brimming  with  happiness  at
realising that what they preach is followed by tangible measures.

This department has a responsibility to provide  resources  for  the  proper
and efficient functioning of the  criminal  and  civil  justice  system.  It
provides legislation and gives administrative support for the  establishment
of institutions required by the Constitution of this country. If one of  our
key objectives is to  improve  service  delivery  and  enhance  the  justice
system's operational capabilities to provide  swift,  effective,  accessible
and efficient justice, the question of case backlogs must  be  addressed  as
speedily as possible. But I am worried about one thing, that the  Department
of Justice does not have the necessary financial resources  to  address  the
matter of case backlogs. We  know  that  the  department  did  identify  the
rolling stone project as  one  of  the  priority  needs.  As  a  result,  it
requested an amount of R10  million,  but  unfortunately  approval  was  not
granted. This should worry all of us as we are seated here in this House.

Linked to this is the question of human resources. We were informed  by  the
department that in 1997 we needed about 1 812 posts, and  of  these  only  a
fraction has been filled to date. This has  resulted  in  serious  personnel
shortages. We are told that to address these problems  we  will  need  about
R220 million and the department  requested,  at  least  for  this  financial
year, R59,056 million. Unfortunately again, approval was not  granted.  This
should be a serious concern to all of us.

Part of our transformation agenda is to repeal outdated laws  and  introduce
new ones that are in line with our Constitution. The Bills that  are  before
Parliament  are  budgeted  for  under  the  legislation  and  constitutional
development business unit. We were informed that out of nine Bills that  are
to be introduced to this Parliament only two have  been  budgeted  for,  and
that is the Judicial Officers Amendment Bill and  the  Child  Justice  Bill.
But I must emphasise that the department  budgeted  R17,7  million  for  the
Child Justice Bill and was only given R4 million,  meaning  that  it  has  a
shortfall of R13,7 million. This should also be a concern to all of us.

Hon members will remember that the Equality Review  Committee  -  I  am  not
raising this matter because I am a member of this committee -  was  supposed
to report to the Minister within a year on section 74 of  the  Promotion  of
Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act of 2000. This work  was
not completed on time due to a lack of financial resources.  I  have  raised
this matter with the department and stated that we cannot  proceed  in  this
manner, where we have structures which were  established  in  terms  of  the
laws of this country but there is no money for those  structures.  Something
needs to be done as speedily as possible.  The  department  did  acknowledge
that what I was saying was correct and, for that matter, they were  thinking
of the possibility of budgeting about R20,936 million for this  legislation.
But, unfortunately, I must say that I am disappointed  that  this  structure
has not received anything to date.

We are aware that  the  department  is  redesigning  and  restructuring  the
maintenance system to enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency.  The
situation as it exists now is a mess. We have received  a  report  from  the
Eastern Cape complaining about the maintenance  offices.  I  hope  that  the
Minister does have this report. We visited the North West a  month  ago  and
what  we  saw  there  cannot  be  mentioned  in  this  House.  It  is  quite
disturbing. I hope that very soon the department will receive the report  if
they do not have it yet. It is clear that we need to make  every  effort  to
ensure that these offices are attended to as soon as possible.

It is  against  this  backdrop  that  we  are  calling  on  all  members  of
Parliament to assist the department to  achieve  the  above  objectives  and
ensuring that, amongst other  things,  they  redesign  and  restructure  the
maintenance system.

Irrespective of the limited resources we must  commend  the  department  for
work well done under very difficult conditions. It is worth mentioning  that
the  National  Prosecuting  Authority,  under  the  leadership  of  Bulelani
Ngcuka, is making progress in  all  areas.  The  average  court  hours  have
improved, the conviction rate has increased and the number of  seizures  and
forfeitures, in the case of the Asset Forfeiture Unit, have  also  increased
tremendously.

Hon members will agree with me that the special operations unit has made  an
impact on combating organised  crime,  urban  terror,  gangsterism,  vehicle
hijacking,  taxi  violence  and  racketeering.  We  need  to   commend   the
department for a job well done.

The separation of judicial and administrative functions  also  needs  to  be
commended, but we will need to build capacity at administrative level  as  a
matter of urgency. When we were in the North  West  we  were  informed  that
most of  the  people  who  were  trained  in  terms  of  the  administrative
functions were magistrates. Now, immediately when one  separates  these  two
functions it will mean that one will need to train other people as  soon  as
possible. But after making investigations immediately after  that  visit,  I
was happy to learn that training had already started and things  were  going
according to  plan.  We  need  to  thank  the  department  for  that  speedy
response.

I am mindful of the time  constraints,  and  may  I  therefore  conclude  by
calling on all South Africans, irrespective of colour,  creed  or  race,  to
agree that the interests of the  country  should  occupy  centre  stage  and
party-political wishes should be relegated to lower  levels,  but  obviously
not to the periphery. An aspect that has caused our  Government,  under  the
leadership of the ANC, to survive during trying moments is the  boldness  we
always demonstrated in undertaking introspection,  the  intention  being  to
look at the weaknesses and threats that have the potential  to  inhibit  the
capacity to realise or reach our objectives. Hon members, let us  not  cause
our Government to fall in that league of people who say, ``we will try  next
time''.

May I conclude by indicating that as the ANC we are proud of  our  past  and
confident of our future. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson  and  members  of  the  National
Council of Provinces, the Minister of Defence and hon  Kgoshi  Mokoena  have
spoken about  the  sterling  work  of  the  SA  National  Defence  Force  in
supporting peace processes on our continent. Indeed, this is  in  line  with
our own policies as a country and with our Constitution.

Well, the role of the SA National Defence Force in a situation of  democracy
must be  that  of  exporting  peace.  This  is  one  of  our  most  precious
commodities as a  country  that  we  can  export  to  other  countries,  the
commodity of peace. But we are building on the tradition and  heritage  that
has been passed on to us by those who have gone before us,  those  who  have
led our organisation. I am thinking here of  our  former  President  Mandela
who, as we all know, is regarded not only by South Africa, but by the  whole
world, as a peacemaker. But President Mandela was following  the  traditions
set by the founders of the ANC in 1912 and followed through the  decades  by
great leaders of the movement, such as Makgatho, Gumede,  Rev  Magabane,  Dr
Xuma, Chief Luthuli and Oliver Tambo.

Oliver Tambo was to lead a noble armed struggle that  was  characterised  by
respect for  civilian  lives  and  constraint  on  the  unnecessary  use  of
violence. President Thabo Mbeki has since  taken  on  this  role  of  making
peace, not only in Africa,  but  all  over  the  world.  The  commitment  to
solving problems through negotiations and peaceful means was to lead to  the
character of our democracy, which came into being in April  1994.  In  1996,
through their Parliament, the people of South Africa were  to  endorse  this
commitment when they declared, and I quote:


  Defence must serve to uphold peace and security in a  democratic  society
  so as to create a stable environment for the improvement of our  people's
  lives and for the development and progress of our country.

The people declared that the preferred and  primary  cause  of  self-defence
was to prevent conflict and war, meaning that South  Africa  would  turn  to
military means only as  a  last  resort,  when  deterrence  and  nonviolence
strategies have failed. The people further declared  that  the  SA  National
Defence Force they wanted would be integrated,  transformed,  representative
and at peace with the world. They wanted an SA National Defence  Force  that
understood that  it  had  a  role  in  the  Reconstruction  and  Development
Programme, the RDP.

The Minister of Defence and Kgoshi Mokoena have  referred  to  the  military
skills development programme. This is our contribution as the Department  of
Defence to the reconstruction and development of our  country,  by  training
our youth and giving them skills so that they  can  contribute  to  building
our country.

In response to the people's call, the Department of Defence  and  the  SANDF
have  proceeded  from  the  understanding  that  defence  encompasses  human
security. That is why the Department of Defence  is  involved  in  the  RDP.
They are linking the need to  secure  our  citizens  against  all  types  of
enemies, including disease, unemployment, lack of skills, unequal access  to
resources and poverty, while contributing to world peace.

As spelt out in the White Paper in the Defence Review,  transformation  must
at all times be guided by the principle of civilian oversight and  scrutiny.
This stresses the  importance  of  strengthening  the  Defence  Secretariat,
which the Minister has referred to, so that it can perform  its  task.  Some
civil-military  relations  also  entail  vibrant  interaction   with   civil
society, as demonstrated during the Defence Review  process.  we  are  doing
this through the Office of the Secretary of Defence who is at the  interface
between the Department of Defence and civil society.

The Minister has referred to the core force concept and the fact  that  this
core force concept depends on the ability of the  Defence  Force  to  expand
quickly should the need arise. This leads  us  to  talk  about  the  reserve
force. Owing to budgetary constraints and the fact that so far that we  have
been concentrating mainly on integrating the regular force, we may not  have
paid the necessary attention to the reserve forces. But we  are  turning  to
that at the moment.

To maintain 35%  strength  in  the  conventional  reserves  and  almost  75%
strength in the  territorial  reserves,  some  R264  million  per  annum  is
required. This amount  excludes  operational  costs,  but  allows  for  fair
recruitment,  training  and  retention  of  the  reserves  as  well  as  the
integration of the ex-MK and ex-Apla members. We do indeed hope  that  these
members will join the reserves, and that ordinary  black  people  will  also
join our reserves. Somebody mentioned the fact that  we  need  to  transform
our commandos. Indeed, we are moving towards this, and we wish to  encourage
black participation in the commandos in order for this  important  structure
to be transformed.
I want to mention here that the commandos have  been  playing  an  important
role in assisting the police to curb rural crime. But,  indeed,  there  have
been elements within the commandos that have acted in a manner that  is  far
from desirable. This is something that we are currently attending to.

I have talked about the contribution of the Department  of  Defence  to  the
RDP. This brings me to the  collateral  utilisation  of  the  Department  of
Defence which is peacetime utilisation of our resources.  This  is  outlined
in the Defence Review and we are  contributing  to  this.  I  am  sure  some
members would have seen our military health service in  KwaZulu-Natal  going
out to assist in fighting cholera. They have also been involved in  fighting
malaria and foot-and-mouth disease. This is the  collateral  utilisation  of
our Defence Force, and we will continue to contribute  in  whatever  way  we
can to meet the needs of the country and our neighbouring countries.

I now want to address the issue of keeping our members in the Defence  Force
healthy. To ensure the optimal  health  of  our  members,  the  department's
programme on combating the spread of HIV/Aids and caring for those that  are
affected is premised on the fundamental principle that HIV/Aids  is  one  of
many chronic, progressive and  potentially  life-threatening  diseases.  The
launch of the Masibambisane  Campaign,  focusing  on  behaviour  change  and
targeting specifically military personnel, has added impetus  to  the  fight
against  HIV/Aids.  To  date,  Masibambisane  has  been  launched  in  seven
provinces. I had the pleasure, recently, of  speaking  at  the  most  recent
launch in the beautiful valley of Magoebaskloof in the Limpopo province.

Our department has been actively involved in  developing  partnerships  with
other state departments and the  private  sector  to  develop  an  effective
demobilisation programme. This is to ensure that those who are  leaving  the
SANDF  are  properly  equipped  for  civilian  life.  Workshops  have   been
conducted to ensure that the demobilised soldiers are not  thrown  onto  the
street, but helped to become self-supporting and economically  active  after
they leave active service in the SANDF.

Regarding the question of our veterans,  I  am  happy  to  report  that  the
Minister of Defence has established the military veterans'  advisory  board,
which is making good progress and is now involved in  preparations  for  the
launch of the new military veterans' federation. This federation  will  have
all veterans from the Second World War, from the struggle,  from  the  SADF.
All these veterans will be working together in the federation. We are  happy
to announce that  this  veterans'  federation  will  host  an  international
conference of veterans next year which will be held in South Africa.

Further on the issue of veterans, we  are  happy  that  the  department  has
adopted a policy to award pensions to the  nonstatutory  force  members  for
the time they served in the  liberation  struggle.  That  service  is  being
recognised by the  Department  of  Defence.  We  are  also  happy  that  the
veterans are involved in the Government's Freedom Park initiative that  will
commemorate and celebrate the history of our struggle for freedom.  And,  as
members saw, the President launched the Freedom  Park  project  on  16  June
2002 in Pretoria. Our veterans are involved in that project.

Coming to the issue of gender, first I must recognise you,  Chairperson,  in
the Chair, the women MECs from  the  Northern  Cape  and  Limpopo  who  have
spoken here, my party caucus chairperson who is here and the many women  who
are in this House that are contributing to  our  democracy.  To  them  I  am
inspired to say: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: We are transforming gender relations in  the
SANDF. Members will know  that  last  year  we  announced  our  first  woman
commander in the Eastern Cape and we also announced our first  woman  pilot.
Attempts are being made to transform the Department of Defence, but this  is
a daunting task, as members would know, because prior  to  1994  there  were
hardly any women in the Department of Defence and now we know  that  through
our Constitution they can serve in combat and at any other level.

In this regard I am happy also to inform this  House  that  the  Council  on
Defence took a  decision  that  the  Directorate:  Equal  Opportunities  and
Affirmative Action should be located in the  Office  of  the  Secretary  for
Defence - which is a very high office - so that they can report directly  to
the Secretary. They are responsible for ensuring and monitoring that we  are
implementing our policies on gender equality.

The launch in August 2000 of the African Women's Peace Table  was  acclaimed
as a groundbreaking initiative. This forum has begun to contribute to  Nepad
by creating  an  opportunity  for  female  soldiers  and  civil  society  to
interact on issues of peace on the continent.

In pursuance of peace, South Africa has spearheaded a campaign  to  rid  our
country and our continent of surplus and illegal arms in  order  to  prevent
them from falling into the wrong hands and being utilised for the  conflicts
in Africa. We have dismantled our military nuclear capability as  a  country
and converted  it  for  nonmilitary  use.  We  campaigned  for  the  ban  of
antipersonnel mines. Our country was among the first to sign  the  mine  ban
treaty and has begun drafting legislation as required by the convention.

The department has destroyed well over one million kilograms of surplus  and
redundant small arms in order to curb their recirculation.  The  SANDF  has,
in joint operations with the  SA  Police  Service,  collected  thousands  of
illegal arms. The department has also participated  in  combined  operations
with Mozambique and Lesotho in an effort to curb the proliferation of  these
small arms, which, when they fall into the wrong hands, are used  for  crime
and for fuelling conflicts.

The  Department  of  Defence  is  involved  in  developing  common  regional
security measures and in  contributing  to  the  harmonisation  of  regional
defence policies and legislation. Countries of the region  are  co-operating
on how to strengthen the  guarding  of  our  common  borders  in  the  fight
against trafficking in arms, drugs and humans.  Indeed,  we  can  truly  say
that our country is transforming the lives of our  people  for  the  better,
and we can say with certainty that Africa will have a lasting peace,  Africa
will be a prosperous continent and Africa will be free. [Applause.]

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, Ministers, MECs and hon members, I stand  here
to endorse and support this Vote on behalf  of  the  ANC.  The  SA  National
Defence Force is one of the few armed forces in the world which accepts  the
right of women to serve in combat. There are women crews  in  the  artillery
and armed corps of the  army.  The  air  force  has  women  trainee  pilots,
something we are proud to mention.

To bring the new attitudes and values of the military  into  line  with  the
fundamental  principles  of  our  new  democracy,  the  department's   civic
education programme on ``Defence in a democracy'' was completed a few  years
ago. This programme has been implemented throughout the Defence Force as  an
integral part of our new military culture.

The Department of Defence notes in its annual report that while striving  to
perform  its  primary  tasks,  that  is  to  provide  and  maintain  defence
capabilities and to deliver services in terms of  defence  commitments  made
by the Government both internally and externally; whenever  members  of  the
SA National Defence Force are utilised, the department collaborates  with  a
range of governments, and regional and international players to ensure  that
these objectives are met. The SANDF is required to  play  a  major  role  in
support of the SA Police Service to maintain internal peace  and  stability.
This is a secondary task and the SA army is not structured to  execute  this
task.

The department's vision is therefore  to  ensure,  in  accordance  with  the
Constitution,  effective  defence  for  South  Africa,  enhancing  national,
regional and  global  security  through  balanced,  modern,  affordable  and
technologically  advanced  defence  capabilities.   The   mission   of   the
department is to provide, manage, prepare and  employ  defence  capabilities
commensurate  with  the  needs  of  South  Africa,  as  regulated   by   the
Constitution.

Over the past year the SA National Defence Force provided  a  diverse  range
of services to South Africa and other African nations, including  operations
to combat crime in co-operation with  the  SAPS;  patrolling  the  country's
borders in the rural areas; providing aid  together  with  other  Government
departments,  especially  the  Department  of  Health  and  Agriculture  and
fulfilling international obligations during peace support operations.

The SA National Defence Force deploys forces in support of  the  SAPS  along
South  Africa's  international  borders.  This  deployment  consists  of  on
average 13 infantry companies patrolling selected sections of land  borders,
supported by elements of the SA Military Health  Services  and  the  SA  Air
Force.

The SA  Air  Force  contributes  aircraft  to  deployed  land  forces  where
necessary and carries out reconnaissance flights  along  the  land  and  sea
borders, where they assist the SA Navy ships patrolling  the  South  African
exclusive economic zone. The SA Navy patrols also assist the  Department  of
Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  with  the   prosecution   of   illegal
fishermen, while maintaining a presence  at  the  scene,  thereby  deterring
other criminal activities such as the smuggling of drugs.

The SA Air Force further assists the Civil Aviation  Authority  and  the  SA
Police Service border component in an attempt to  control  illegal  aircraft
entering South African airspace.

In the meantime, the department  has  prioritised  activities,  taking  into
account the maintenance of personnel defence  capabilities  and  capacities,
operational readiness, preparation for defence  contingents,  the  execution
of operational task commitments and contractual obligations.

In terms of national HIV/Aids policy, the department does  not  discriminate
against members who have contracted the virus. This has led  to  changes  in
the mix of spending on care and support, but has not increased the  rate  of
growth of expenditure.

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the SA  National  Defence  Force
and the SA Police Service on their joint protect to curb  escapes  from  the
custody of South African Correctional  Services,  an  initiative  which  was
launched in co-operation with the  Council  for  Scientific  and  Industrial
Research, the CSIR. This research focuses on the technical  side  of  police
cell security and, more  specifically,  a  specialised  electronic  security
system. A prototype system  has  been  installed  and  is  being  monitored,
although some weaknesses have been identified.

For the past two years no escapes were experienced from the cells where  the
system had been installed. There were  attempts  where  detainees  tried  to
escape but the system notified the members  on  duty  before  these  escapes
could take place. It is foreseen that an affordable solution will  be  found
in the near future in order to get the implementation phase off the ground.

Mr I W KOTSOANE (Free State): Chairperson, we rise  to  support  the  Budget
Vote of the Department of Safety and Security, which we as  the  Free  State
believe will enhance our capacity to fight crime in our communities.  We  do
so by saluting communities in the Free State for their  selflessness  during
the  month  of  Letsema,  and  their  continued  participation  in   Letsema
campaigns at different police stations across the Free State.

At the beginning  of  the  campaign,  throughout  the  month,  over  25  000
volunteers were registered at police stations in the province. In  terms  of
police statistics, this is the largest number of volunteers ever  registered
in the country. This was made possible by the level of co-operation  between
our community  policing  forums,  communities  and  members  of  the  police
service.  Volunteers  provide  services  to  the  police  which  range  from
administrative work to cleaning and painting our police stations.  This  has
made it possible for large numbers of police officers to  be  released  from
those administrative jobs, to be able to be visible in our communities.

Many more of our compatriots enrolled as reservists  while  others  took  to
the streets in pursuit of different campaigns such  as  ``No  to  woman  and
child abuse'', ``No to drugs and substance  abuse''  and  ``Crime  does  not
pay''.

The launch of ``Reject stolen goods'' by the late Minister Steve Tshwete  in
Thabong saw a massive turn-out by our people, who felt that it was  time  to
close the  market  for  stolen  goods  in  our  communities.  Such  positive
responses have brought home the fact that, given an opportunity  and  space,
our people are willing  constructively  to  contribute  to  development  and
service delivery where they live, particularly  with  regard  to  programmes
that are aimed at reducing crime.

As we progress with this campaign for the remainder of  this  year,  we  are
thrilled by Popcru's willingness to heed the Presidential  call  and  to  be
involved in Letsema. This will involve overtime work by its members  without
any expectation to be paid. Those who are on leave will  be  mobilised  from
time to time to contribute freely to the success of this  campaign  and  the
reduction of crime in our province.

The  involvement  of  the  young  people  in  this   campaign   is   equally
acknowledged,  since  they  are  most  likely   participants   in   criminal
activities. All of these activities are indicative of the  levels  of  trust
that exist between our communities and the SAPS, and indeed we can  say,  as
a  province,  that  the  SAPS  is  being  transformed  and  this  is  highly
appreciated by our communities.

The problems of youth gangsterism in Bethlehem continue to  worry  us  as  a
province. We have seen the establishment of groups called Cats of  Milk  and
Dogs of War, with members as young as 12 and as  old  as  25.  These  groups
have  been  terrorising  the  community  of  Bohlokong,  raping  women   and
children, and have been involved  in  robbery,  housebreaking  and  murders.
However, my department, the Departments of  Education,  Social  Development,
Correctional Services and Justice  are  involved  in  a  programme  for  the
rehabilitation of those young  people.  Jointly,  we  will  be  launching  a
rehabilitation centre for those who are willing to be rehabilitated.

Some of these young people were sent for rehabilitation to a centre in  Cape
Town and I wish to thank the Chrysalis Academy for  their  support  in  this
regard, as well as the MEC from the Western Cape.

Indications thus far are that these gangs are  not  linked  in  any  way  to
illicit drug trafficking. The police will continue to investigate all  cases
that are outstanding against these groups and those  who  are  found  to  be
involved in any criminal activities will be arrested.

We have to report that yesterday we as a province opened the  Mangaung  One-
stop Child Justice Centre. This  event  took  place  while  the  country  is
hosting  an  international  conference  in  Port  Elizabeth  on  the   theme
``Developing citizenship among the youth in conflict with  the  law  on  the
African continent''. This facility is  a  replica  of  the  Stepping  Stones
concept found in Port Elizabeth.

The centre is a reflection of collaborative  efforts  by  all  stakeholders,
the  police,  the  Justice   Department,   Correctional   Services,   Social
Development and NGOs that have the interests of children  in  conflict  with
the law at heart. One of the  aims  of  this  facility  will  be  to  ensure
restorative justice, as opposed to the punitive measures  that  used  to  be
applied against young offenders. It will  provide  legal  representation  to
children and ensure the speedy delivery of justice services to them.

Over the past few days concerns have been raised by Free  State  farmers  on
the border between the Free State and  Lesotho.  These  concerns  relate  to
growing cross-border stock theft, illegal grazing of  animals  from  Lesotho
on Free State farms, veld fires on farms, the cutting of border  fences  and
general destruction of property.
Obviously, these issues do have an impact on  the  security  and  safety  of
both farmers and farmworkers in the province. They impact negatively on  the
economy of the Free  State,  since  some  farmers  are  no  longer  actively
involved in farming activities along the border.

In the discussions we had  with  farmers,  contrary  to  what  some  of  the
opposition parties say - and particularly the DP - about the  withdrawal  of
the army on the border, farmers noted and acknowledged that the  decline  of
the Lesotho economy and drought were major factors that contributed to  this
problem recently. They acknowledge that economic growth  and  food  security
in Lesotho would help to  recreate  good  relations  with  the  citizens  of
Lesotho.

Within the context of our region, that is, SADC, and Nepad, there is a  need
for both provincial and national governments to get  into  discussions  with
the Lesotho government in order to create  an  atmosphere  of  co-operation.
The farmers are willing to assist farming communities on  the  Lesotho  side
to re-establish farming activities in order to  achieve  food  security  for
the Lesotho citizens.

They request that the Government of South  Africa,  and  in  particular  the
Department of Public Works, should help with  the  fencing  of  the  border,
since this is nonexistent for a stretch of about 25 km. Issues  raised  here
particularly relate to those farmers on the Wepener-Zastron border.

In the eastern part of our province, that is in the Fouriesburg,  Fauresmith
and Ficksburg area, farmers have the same  concerns.  However,  we  want  to
report here today that since my meeting with them, there has been  a  marked
improvement in co-operation between them and Marenana on the  Lesotho  side.
This has resulted in the reduction of crime, particularly  stock  theft,  as
well as veld fires. They hold regular meetings between  the  communities  in
Lesotho and the SAPS, as well as the Lesotho police.

I therefore wish to request the Minister to pay a visit to the  Free  State,
so that  together  we  can  enhance  this  necessary  relationship  and  co-
operation between our farming communities and the Lesotho citizens.  Lesotho
is a foreign country and we as a province cannot begin to  engage  in  those
types of discussions. We felt that we needed to put the record straight,  so
that whoever rises here in this Chamber or anywhere else and makes an  issue
about the South African army's withdrawal from the border should  know  that
it is  not  a  reflection  on  farmers  in  that  area.  Farmers  want  more
collaboration and co-operation with the Lesotho citizens.

As a country we have indeed achieved many things within a very  short  space
of time, one of which is our very own Constitution, and  in  particular  the
Bill of Rights. The Constitution requires all of us, collectively  as  South
African citizens, to promote a culture of human rights in the country.

However, we wish to note that some of our patriots, particularly  on  farms,
continue to undermine the  very  culture  we  seek  to  nurture.  There  are
numerous cases that have been reported by farm employees against  their  own
employers. These range from  refusing  burial  rights  to  the  deceased  to
physical assault and illegal evictions of farmworkers.

We still have to hear a member of the opposition  party  who  rises  in  any
Chamber and begins to condemn this, because what they do at all times ...

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, on a point of order: As a member of the  opposition
party, I would like to correct, for the record, perhaps,  the  ignorance  of
the hon member. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  I  am  in  control.
Continue, Mr Kotsoane. [Interjections.] Hon members, if you do not  give  me
the chance to listen to what the point of order is, on any other occasion  I
will not be able to judge whether a person is wrong or right. Hon  Kotsoane,
you may continue.

Mr I W KOTSOANE: Chairperson, the point I  want  to  highlight  is  that  we
still have to hear any member of the opposition who will raise  their  voice
when  a  farmworker  is  killed  and  when  farmworkers'  rights  are  being
undermined by farmers. [Laughter.] [Interjections.] They continue to  create
the impression that this Government ... [Interjections.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it in  order  for  the  hon
MEC to mislead the House by telling inexactitudes?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! May I say to the  House  that  I  will
give a judgment on that matter because ``misleading'' has two contexts.  One
may mislead purposely in the understanding or  not,  so  it  means  I  would
still have to go and look into whether  the  misunderstanding  there  was  a
purposeful misunderstanding or not. Hon member Kotsoane, continue.

Mr I W KOTSOANE: Chairperson, we have no  intention  whatsoever  to  mislead
the House, but what is being reported every time ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Kotsoane, pass the point  that  you  have
already mentioned.

Mr I W KOTSOANE: Chairperson, when we raise this issue we  are  seen  to  be
inflaming  racial  conflicts  within  our  communities.  However,  we   will
continue to raise this matter, because these issues - that is, human  rights
issues - particularly in our communities, are the centre of our own  nation-
building programme.

We are pleased that the Human  Rights  Commission  will  be  holding  public
hearings shortly to begin to  investigate  some  of  these  issues.  We  are
equally happy that we have finally reached an agreement with  the  organised
farming community in the Free State on the  need  to  address  human  rights
issues that continue to bedevil the relationships.  A  shared  understanding
of the need to address the human rights culture between  my  department  and
the agricultural union is a step worth commending.

It is worth mentioning that the increase of the budget of the Department  of
Safety and Security will  help  us  greatly  in  our  fight  against  crime.
However, we wish to place on record that a situation of overcrowding in  our
police stations is a serious concern since it  places  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the Table staff  is  very
vigilant. Once there is a disturbance like a point of order,  the  time  for
anybody who is speaking is really kept in abeyance. Their allocated time  is
never taken by such disturbances.

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson ... [Interjections.] I  can  speak  English,  for
that hon member's information.

On Budget Vote 21, Defence, we can truly say that this  is  a  case  of  too
many  chiefs  and  not  enough  troops.  Personnel  expenditure,  with   the
exclusion of the arms deal, equates to an unsatisfactory 52%  of  the  total
budget, which is simply caused by too many generals and senior staff  within
the department. South Africa's ratio ... [Interjections.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, on a point  of  order:  Is  it  parliamentary  for
someone to sit with a hat on while an hon member is speaking? [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It might be. If my  memory  serves  me
well - at your age you will have seen that  -  parliament  was  a  house  of
hats. Ladies put on hats in parliament. Carry on, hon member. [Laughter.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, personnel expenditure  is  52%  of  the  budget,
which is simply caused by too many generals  and  senior  staff  within  the
department. South Africa's ratio of  one  general  for  every  245  privates
compares extremely poorly to other countries. It is  extremely  ironic  that
in the new democratic South Africa ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Theron, I regret to  disturb  you.
Hon member Raju, this is unlike you. You are contemptuous towards me, and  I
do not expect that from you. [Laughter.] Please people, though  we  are  all
human and humorous, let us not  turn  our  House  into  something  like  the
British parliament. Continue, hon member.

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I hope I can now progress to another  paragraph.
It is extremely ironic that in  the  new  democratic  South  Africa  defence
spending has risen to  an  importance  similar  to  that  found  during  the
previous  dispensation.  In  fact,  the  Department  of  Defence  has   been
allocated the second biggest budget, totalling R18,4 billion.

Incidents in Burundi and the DRC provide enough  reason  to  reconsider  the
deployment of our troops in these countries, especially in the light of  the
expensive and failed DRC conference at Sun City. The  shocking  findings  of
the joint investigative team released  during  November  last  year  clearly
implicated Government and definitely did not exonerate it.

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, I would  like  to  ask  if  the  hon  member  is
willing to take a question.

Mr J L THERON: I will take no question from him. [Laughter.]

The suspension of the Chief Whip of the ANC, the resignation of Mr Shaik  as
the chief acquisition officer, the arrest of  the  managing  director  of  a
well-known German company  and  the  subsequent  prosecution  indicate  that
Cabinet should, however, have been involved in the process of selecting  the
various contractors.

Die Regering het aangedui  dat  die  koste  van  die  wapentransaksie  R52,7
miljard bedra terwyl die bedrag maklik verdubbel  kan  word  as  gevolg  van
finansieringskoste. Die Regering het dus nagelaat om die publiek in  te  lig
oor die werklike korrekte koste vir die belastingbetaler. Die Regering  moet
ook  weer  gaan  dink  oor  die  verdere  aankope   van   vegvliegtuie   ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The Government has indicated that the costs of  the  arms  deal  amount  to
R52,7 billion, while the amount could easily be  doubled  owing  to  finance
charges. The Government has therefore neglected to inform the  public  about
the truly  correct  costs  to  the  taxpayer.  The  Government  should  also
reconsider the further purchase of fighter planes ... ]  ...  the  so-called
second tranche ... aangesien  dit  hoegenaamd  nie  ooreenstem  met  huidige
behoeftes nie. Dit  is  totaal  onbekostigbaar.  [...  as  this  in  no  way
corresponds with current needs. It is totally unaffordable.]

Surely, a  review  of  the  Defence  Review  needs  to  be  undertaken.  The
scandalous arms deal and the deployments in Burundi  and  the  DRC  indicate
that the force design and structure  of  the  National  Defence  Force  need
reformulation, as indicated by  the  Minister.  The  Defence  Ministry  has,
however, indicated that such a review will not take place.

Mr V V Z WINDVOÃ«L: Chairperson, on a point of order: My view is that  it  is
gravely unparliamentary for a  member  to  point  a  finger  at  a  national
Minister, and I thus request that he apologises.

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  when  a  person  is
talking, depending on the context, pointing a finger at someone  might  mean
ridicule or something else. [Interjections.] Hon  Theron,  will  you  please
continue.

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, dankie. Ek  is  bly  u  probeer  die  orde  hier
handhaaf.

'n Laaste ernstige probleem wat ek wil aanspreek, is die  aankoopbeleid  vir
verdedigingsaankope. Soos in die begroting gesien  kan  word,  word  hierdie
jaar alleen R7,6 miljard  bestee  aan  die  wapenaankooptransaksie,  en  dit
sonder 'n aanvaarde aankoopbeleid. In die gesamentlike ondersoek wat  gedoen
is nÃ¡ die wapenaankooptransaksie,  is  in  elke  hoofstuk  van  die  verslag
daarop gewys dat die aankoopbeleid onvoldoende is, en  dat  dit  'n  oorsaak
van die probleme was.

Tans is die aankoopbeleid nog nie gefinaliseer of goedgekeur nie. Die  vraag
is dus hoe al hierdie miljarde rande bestee kan word sonder 'n  goedgekeurde
aankoopbeleid. Waarvolgens moet die amptenare hierdie aankope doen? Ek  dink
die Minister behoort ernstig aandag aan diÃ© saak te  skenk  sodat  vordering
met hierdie belangrike probleem gemaak kan word. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)
[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, thank you. I am glad that  you  are  trying  to
maintain order here.

A final serious problem that I want to address  is  the  procurement  policy
for defence acquisitions. As can be seen  from  the  budget,  in  this  year
alone R7,6 billion is being expended on the arms  purchase  deal,  and  this
without an acceptable procurement policy. In every chapter of the report  on
the joint investigation into the arms purchase deal it has been pointed  out
that the procurement policy is inadequate and that this has been a cause  of
the problems.

At present the procurement policy has not yet been  finalised  or  approved.
The question is therefore how all these  billions  of  rands  can  be  spent
without  an  approved  procurement  policy.  According  to  what  must   the
officials arrange these procurements? I think  the  Minister  ought  to  pay
serious attention to this matter in order to make progress with this  urgent
problem.]

In conclusion, it  is  clear  that  the  Department  of  Defence,  with  the
assistance of the Ministry of Defence, has made it  impossible  for  the  DP
and the DA to support this Budget Vote.
The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson and hon  members,  it  is
always a pleasure for me to address this  august  House.  I  must  say  that
today I appear before this House at a time when hon members' good minds  and
hearts must be troubled with what  the  SABC's  Special  Assigment  screened
last night. I  am  referring  here  to  sharp  incidents  of  corruption  at
Grootvlei prison.

Having said that, I must pause a  bit  and  say  that  I  want  to  heartily
appreciate the motion which was  moved  by  the  hon  Evelyn  Lubidla  about
correctional services earlier on because I feel that it is also a source  of
inspiration when there is positive recognition  of  the  work  that  we  are
trying to do with regard to corruption. I am also appreciative of  the  fact
that there is a lot of moral outrage in  the  public  and  also  within  the
House. People saw horrendous pictures  last  night  and  they  feel  morally
outraged about what happened. I think that is understandable  because  I  am
also a little angry and outraged too. I think most of our officials who  are
not involved in such things also feel outraged.

A few years ago President Mbeki quoted  from  Chinua  Achebe's  book  Things
Fall Apart. He was looking at how Chinua Achebe was disillusioned about  the
behaviour of African leaders after independence. He said that from  the  way
they were doing things, he felt that they had learnt the art of deceit  over
a period of time and they were poisoning the nuts that  they  fed  to  their
own friends.

I also remember President Kaunda, after  his  country's  independence,  when
civil servants were in dereliction of duty, sitting in  parks  and  drinking
because it was uhuru, and they were not going to work as they were  supposed
to. Sorrowfully, he had to threaten them by saying  that  he  was  going  to
resign from the presidency because, as he put it at that  time,  ``I  refuse
to lead a drunken nation''. He felt betrayed. Chinua Achebe  felt  betrayed.
What I saw yesterday made me feel betrayed as well.  I  think  my  officials
also felt betrayed.

I must add that I want to appeal to this House not to take umbrage  at  what
happened at Grootvlei and use that to  condemn  the  entire  prison  system,
because the majority of the officials are  duty-conscious,  law-abiding  and
committed to their work. It is only the minority who are guilty, and we  are
trying to deal with that.

As I have always said, in South Africa's prison system we are  dealing  with
deeply entrenched cultures and subcultures, involving both prison  officials
and prisoners. This  is  a  system  which  mirrors  society  in  many  ways,
including defying the laws of man and the laws of nature. The fact  that  we
have people  that  are  regarded  as  discarded  social  misfits,  offenders
incarcerated in institutions, means that we are going to find some of  these
things. They are going to defy the laws of man, they are going to  defy  the
laws of nature.

The House has requested us as officials and as Ministers to deal with  these
issues, knowing that they will do that, they will defy  these  laws.  It  is
for this reason that I continue to say  that  fighting  corruption,  in  the
criminal justice system and prisons, should be embraced by all  -  that  is,
the  concerned  public,  concerned  business,  concerned  nonstate   actors,
concerned Unions and the political parties. It should  also  be  noted  that
the majority  of  prison  officials  are  unionised,  with  heavy  political
leanings and influence.

Therefore we should not simply be interested in membership fees  and  votes,
and then let them run loose, corrupting the institutions. I think we  should
curb that ourselves, as it is also our responsibility.

Subsequent to the brutal slaying of one of  our  top  officials,  Thuthukile
Bhengu, in the Pietermaritzburg management area last year, I  requested  the
President to establish a judicial commission of inquiry into the  widespread
allegations of corruption, maladministration and mismanagement in prisons.

The  President,  in  consultation  with  the  Minister   for   Justice   and
Constitutional Development, obliged and  appointed  Judge  Thabang  Jali  to
lead  the  commission.  We  often  hear  that  the  President  instructed  a
commission to take on certain duties, but we all  know  that  our  President
does not operate  in  that  fashion.  The  President  takes  the  needs  and
interests and requests of Ministers into account. So  I  made  the  request,
because I was aware of this malice myself, and  the  President  obliged.  He
did not instruct anybody; he does not operate that way.

The initial request was that  the  commission  should  focus  on  the  large
management areas in various provinces. However, with the  commission  having
completed its work  in  two  of  the  institutions  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  more
information and corruption in smaller or medium-sized institutions  came  to
the fore, and I had to approach the President again to extend the  scope  of
the commission to include the Grootvlei management area in the  Free  State.
The SABC might say they were screening this so that  the  public  might  see
what was happening, but we were on top of the problem already, so we  should
ask them why they screened it.

As a result of the activities broadcast on television last night, and  while
the commission continues with its work,  I  have,  as  an  interim  measure,
given instructions for the four affected  prisoners  to  be  transferred  to
another prison,  for  their  own  safety.  Secondly  I  have  given  further
instructions for the suspension of all the warders implicated in  the  video
... [Applause] ... so  that  further  investigations  into  the  matter  can
proceed without hindrance.

We also expect that the report and recommendations of  the  Jali  commission
will provide Correctional Services with the platform and foundation to  deal
with these issues across the board, without investigating  all  the  prisons
in the country. We have about 238, if not 240, prisons around this  country.
We had selected only eight, and it was going to cost us  about  R10  million
to do that with the commission. If we are asked to take  240,  and  let  the
commission to go through them all, then I do not  think  we  will  have  the
resources to deal with that.

The  department  will  establish  a   committee   that   will   ensure   the
implementation of the recommendations of the Jali  commission,  whereas  the
management board of the department will have to develop medium-term to long-
term strategies in dealing with  these  issues.  The  department's  response
must result in  a  sustainable  and  clean  investigative  and  disciplinary
capacity within the department. In the previous financial year up  to  March
2002, 236 reports on corruption through the hotline for  whistle-blowing  in
our department were received. As a result 23 officials have been  dismissed,
76 disciplined and 14 criminally convicted.

Furthermore I  have  approved  the  utilisation  of  external  providers  to
investigate and establish business processes  and  systems  and  structures.
The tendering process for the  identification  of  a  suitable  provider  is
under way, and it is hoped that a selection will be made before the  end  of
this month. This project, which is meant to re-engineer the  department,  is
known as ``Gearing DCS for Rehabilitation''.

The fundamental challenges that the department is facing will  be  addressed
in this Medium-Term Expenditure Framework period, starting with  the  budget
of about R6,8 billion allocated for  the  2002-03  financial  year.  If  the
current progress is to be sustained, we need that money and  we  need  more.
Of this amount, R4,5 billion, which represents 66,26% of the  total  budget,
will go towards human resources, as we are a labour-intensive department.

I always said to my colleagues here, to the Minister here and  the  Minister
of Safety  and  Security,  that  if  we  take  the  number  of  incarcerated
prisoners, including those who  are  on  probation  and  those  who  are  on
parole, and compare that with the  combined  number  of  the  army  and  the
police, we have a serious situation. We ought to be concerned that  we  have
an army there which outnumbers the official army and  the  police  combined.
[Laughter.] Throughout the world we can find some islands with a  population
smaller than our prison population, which means we could take them  out  and
create an independent state somewhere. I am simply emphasising the level  of
the growth of the prison population in South Africa. It is rapid.

The department is  committed  to  making  its  presence  felt  in  provinces
through projects that will be piloted under the  following  broad  areas  of
operation, among others: rehabilitation -  members  have  mentioned  that  -
poverty alleviation and community corrections. Rehabilitation,  we  believe,
provides  programmes  for  skills  and  personal  development,  as  well  as
processes for reintegrating prisoners into the  community,  and  remains  at
the centre of our core business.

One speaker here was a little bit sceptical about rehabilitation. I  do  not
know what we could do with those people if we did not rehabilitate  them.  I
think people are outraged about what they saw last night, but it is not  the
whole  picture.  This  is  what  has  been  happening  in  all   these   big
institutions. Again we know that they are not staying there, and we  do  not
have the death sentence any more. So they are going to prison and  they  are
coming back out. We are saying when they come  back  they  should  be  in  a
position to make a positive impact in reducing crime among the public.
That is why we have also moved  the  approach  of  restorative  justice,  by
which the community, the victims and the perpetrators could all  go  through
a process of healing. If members say we should not do those things,  then  I
do not know.

The allocated budget for this programme, though  not  sufficient,  is  about
R353 million, and represents only a one percent increase over  the  previous
year. In making reference to our  rehabilitation  programmes,  it  is  worth
noting that a  multidisciplinary  assessment  tool  for  prisoner  profiles,
appropriate development programmes and production projects providing  skills
to offenders will be finalised during this financial year.

Other programmes focus on agriculture, wood, steel  and  textile  production
projects. When I was introducing my Budget Vote in  the  National  Assembly,
members may have noticed some of the articles which were  displayed  outside
here which have been produced by prisoners.  We  are  currently  serving  17
Government departments and producing for our own consumption. I think  self-
sufficiency in food production and consumption in all the  prisons  combined
is about 72%, and the rest is provided through the budget.
We believe that literacy is the foundation stone  in  rehabilitation,  hence
we provide adult basic education and training, Abet, in  collaboration  with
external stakeholders, including the Department of Education. Our target  is
to educate and train more than 11 000 prisoners in Abet  programmes,  11Â 500
in basic occupational skills, and 7Â 800 in  business  management  skills  in
the current MTEF cycle. Well, some people might say  that  out  of  175  000
prisoners, this is a small number. But I think it is quite a number  in  one
financial year.

Out of the 14 planned skills training centres, four are  nearing  completion
at Polokwane in the Limpopo province, Odi in the  North  West,  Johannesburg
in Gauteng and Bethal in Mpumalanga, and I am sure the respective  MECs  who
are here, and I have mentioned their areas, must also be happy that  we  are
contributing towards their work in those  areas.  Three  have  already  been
opened at St Albans in the Eastern Cape and Upington and  Kimberley  in  the
Northern Cape.

The department's poverty alleviation programme was  officially  launched  in
the presence of the Deputy President at  Zonderwater  at  the  beginning  of
April this year. The department launched the programme in  response  to  the
President's call to all of us  to  contribute  to  poverty  alleviation  and
rural development, and to embrace the spirit of Letsema and Vukuzenzele,  as
he pronounced in his state of  the  nation  address  early  this  year.  The
intention is to support community development projects such as the  building
of  rural  schools,  partnerships  in  agricultural   projects,   carpentry,
construction and other projects in which the  community  will  require  such
assistance.

As  an  implementation  strategy  the   department   works   together   with
nongovernmental agencies  and  community-based  organisations  and  involves
them  in  these  poverty  alleviation  and  distribution   programmes.   The
department contributed a piece of land in Zonderwater to the many people  of
the Motsweding district to be used for vegetable  production,  so  that  the
produce could be distributed to those who are in dire  need.  Here  we  were
saying that the community ought to select the  institutions  where  we  have
the disabled, the old age pensioners, the children's feeding schemes.  These
are the areas they should target with their produce.

In Thohoyandou, 20 prisoners took part in  the  construction  of  classrooms
for the children of Mutshalingana Primary School. This  followed  a  request
made  by  the  Vondwe  community  for  assistance  in  the  construction  of
classrooms to ease the plight of children in the area who were being  taught
under trees at that point.  I  think  here  I  must  pause  to  say  that  I
appreciated the assistance of the  MEC  for  safety  and  liaison  and  also
Kgoshi Mokoena, who were instrumental in facilitating these things.

Since the construction of this  project,  our  Thohoyandou  management  area
alone has received about 24 more similar requests, including  one  from  the
University of Venda. Now, if a  university  recognises  that  prisoners  can
actually build parts of the university, I think we  ought  to  be  proud  of
that. Does Mr Matthee not also think so? I  think  so.  [Applause.]  If  one
looks at the building  that  they  erected  there,  for  those  children  at
Mutshalingana, one would say  it  was  built  by  professional  builders  or
engineers - people who knew what they were doing. This  is  because  we  had
bricklayers and engineers who were trained in prison, and  some  trained  in
electrification and roofing. That is why  it  was  quite  professional.  Now
they can even do it for the university.

It is our desire that projects such as the one I have just  referred  to  be
rolled out to all parts of the country where we  have  a  presence.  We  are
aware of our capacity and resource constraints, but we shall  do  everything
within our means to ensure that projects of this nature  form  part  of  our
poverty alleviation  strategy.  Our  initial  plan  is  to  provide  such  a
facility in each of the nine provinces depending on the availability of  the
land and on the circumstances prevailing in each province.

It is, however, unfortunate that on 9 June 2002  we  lost  through  wildfire
the production of about 15 050 kg of maize ready to be harvested at  one  of
our projects, that is the Amakhaya Farm Project in Mpumalanga.  Again,  this
is where a piece of land was  allocated  to  Correctional  Services  by  one
Nkosi Mthethwa. Here, the prisoners work with the members of  the  community
to produce for their consumption and for the  poor  within  that  community.
This loss represents about 251 bags of maize weighing 60 kg each.

We inaugurated the community corrections forum for the Limpopo  province  in
Polokwane in November last year to encourage  the  active  participation  of
the community in the rehabilitation process of the prisoner as a  collective
responsibility and to strengthen partnerships with  the  community.  Another
purpose is to decentralise community corrections offices in  order  to  make
them more accessible to offenders because some offenders  are  not  able  to
afford the travelling expenses of getting to these offices for reporting.

Therefore they abscond and then  have  a  high  record  of  absconding.  The
majority of them, again, have been stigmatised; they do not find  jobs.  But
we expect them to visit the police corrections offices to record  that  they
are still within the area. So these community corrections forums  are  meant
for that - to assist those offenders.  In  addition,  other  provinces  have
also  established  community  corrections  forums  where  members   of   the
community are involved in the activities of the department.

Overcrowding remains one of the biggest challenges  facing  our  department.
The MEC alluded to that earlier on. Overcrowding violates the  human  rights
of offenders,  results  in  the  overextension  of  our  staff  and  creates
conditions that are not conducive to rehabilitation. For both prisoners  and
officials, overcrowding is really not a good thing.
Statistics indicate that 4 out of every 1 000 South Africans are  in  prison
and that more than a third of pre-sentenced prisoners who pose no threat  to
society are in prison merely because they are unable to  afford  bail,  even
if is R50. I told the House some time back that Judge Fagan told me about  a
boy he found in the Free State who was in prison awaiting  trial  for  three
months. He asked the boy, ``Why are you here?'' And this young fellow  said,
`` Well, I stole two mangoes'', and he has been in prison for three  months.
One feeds this fellow at a rate of R95 a day and he stole two mangoes!  What
does one do with that situation?

Overcrowding owing to awaiting trial, sentenced and pre-sentenced  prisoners
stands  at  55  500.  However,  it  should   be   noted   that   alternative
accommodation for  pre-sentenced  or  awaiting  trial  prisoners  would  not
remove overcrowding completely. Various mechanisms utilised to  address  the
size of the pre-sentenced  prisoner  population  among  the  Justice,  Crime
Prevention and Security, JCPS, cluster should be intensified.

The Department of Correctional Services has established a task team  for  an
anti-overcrowding strategy and requested the JCPS cluster  task  group  into
overcrowding to resolve the cross-cutting responsibilities  of  overcrowding
and to find longer-term solutions for  Cabinet  to  deliberate  on,  and  to
monitor  criminal  justice  processes  in  order  to   proactively   address
generators of overcrowding.

Here, I am simply saying that overcrowding  is  not  the  responsibility  of
Correctional Services alone. I think  that  has  been  said  over  and  over
again. I have also told this House of the case of two young boys aged of  11
and 12, who were offenders, I think,  for  breaking  in  and  stealing.  The
magistrate said they had to go to prison, to  Pollsmoor.  Our  area  manager
said that they were too young to be taken to prison, but he  was  told  that
he would soon be charged with contempt. So he had  to  take  them  in.  What
does one do in those circumstances? In  this  regard,  one  would  say  that
children do not belong in prison. I say to  Mr  Lever  that  these  are  the
things that I encounter.

Last year Parliament amended the Correctional  Services  Act  to  allow  for
greater community participation in the parole system. The  establishment  of
decision-making  parole  boards  with  community  representation  has   been
referred to  the  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  for  Correctional
Services, Judge Siraj Desai, to  assist  in  determining  the  criteria  for
selection of candidates from the community and in setting up the new  parole
boards throughout the country.

The Judicial Inspectorate, under the leadership of Judge J  J  Fagan,  needs
to be commended also for the support  they  have  given  us,  especially  in
dealing  with  the  issues  of  overcrowding.  Their  facilitation  in   the
implementation of sections 62(f) and 63(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act  is
continuing to assist us in dealing with overcrowding.

In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation for the support  that
we are continuing to receive from this House, from the  chairperson  of  the
Select Committee on Justice, Kgoshi  Mokoena,  from  other  stakeholders  in
this House and also from the provinces in  our  efforts  to  build  a  safer
community for all. We are only able to extend our services to all  provinces
if we can rely on hon members' co-operation so that we can  also  contribute
to our ultimate aim of building a better life for all. [Applause.]

Mr  B  J  MKHALIPHI:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers  and  hon  members,   the
restriction of movement, communication, interaction and denial of access  to
the amenities of life  is  viewed  as  a  suitable  and  civilised  form  of
punitive measure meted out to those who have been found to  be  in  conflict
with the law. The state is obliged to keep those accused  and  found  guilty
in safe and humane  custody,  regardless  of  the  offence  committed.  Safe
custody entails here the imprisonment  of  an  individual  so  that  certain
harmful acts against citizens and property are curtailed.  It  also  secures
the  offender   against   possible   revenge   action   by   the   offended.
Paradoxically, safe custody of offenders even thwarts gang wars.

The attainment of more political rights with an imbalance  of  socioeconomic
rights in terms of  the  depressed  state  of  the  economy  poses  its  own
contradiction. The decline in formal employment renders  large  sections  of
the  population  unable  to  fend  for  themselves  and  their   dependants.
Committing a crime might be viewed as the only alternative because in  terms
of this reasoning it will provide instant  relief  for  the  need,  and,  if
caught, one is guaranteed accommodation and a regular meal.

In reality, there is no longer an excuse to harbour such  negative  thoughts
since poverty alleviation and capacity-building funds are there, to  mention
just a few, for almost every citizen with a positive and enterprising  mind,
as long as he or she comes to grips with the  reality  that  the  Government
accords one opportunities, and not ready-made job opportunities  to  sustain
oneself and one's fellow humans. Self-created jobs have  usually  no  limits
in terms  of  expansion  and  have  the  added  advantage  of  breeding  new
entrepreneurs who espouse a higher degree of patriotism, since they  have  a
larger stake to protect in terms of the community and the environment.

Recreation facilities in prisons should, at best, be restricted to the  need
to sustain a healthy body and mind, and not be in the luxury  category.  The
same could be said about food and accommodation. There are other  challenges
involved. For instance: How does one  limit  the  external  performances  of
music shows by the famous choir of Barberton prison? How does  one  prohibit
the community of Carolina who clamour for the moving sermons of Rev  Magwaza
inside the prison? Surely we cannot refuse to release  the  talented  tailor
Zakes Thomo on parole, since  Carolina  Outfitters  are  desperate  for  his
skills?

We need to take a serious look at  the  policy  regarding  prisoners  having
babies within the prisons for the sake of these  innocent  infants  who  are
brought up in this abnormal environment. There  is  a  saying  to  consider:
What is learnt in the cradle lasts to the tomb.

Habitual offenders, that is recidivists, have  the  potential  of  reversing
and even negating whatever gains are attained through community  corrections
processes. Disincentives should be put in  place,  for  instance  no  parole
should be considered for any confirmed habitual offender.

On average the majority of prisons  are  managed  well  and  are  thus  well
geared to deal with the critical  project  of  rehabilitating  prisoners.  A
change in attitude, as we know, and behaviour  cannot  be  demanded  of  the
inmates. This process cannot be physically  measured  since  it  involves  a
sophisticated, but spontaneous and gradual change in the inner self  of  the
inmates. But  corrupt  prison  officials  have  discredited  themselves  and
cannot, by any measure, be entrusted with these holy matters of the soul.

The Jali Commission of  Inquiry,  the  work  of  Judge  Fagan  and  our  own
oversight role of the prison services, will hopefully assist us in  bringing
about a clean administration and management in the prisons  so  that  we  do
not have to contend with horrible and sordid  incidents  such  as  those  of
Grootvlei Prison, as shown on Special Assignment last night.

As we proceed with the initiative of private prisons  we  should  make  sure
that we receive the expected  returns  for  that  investment.  Lessons  from
other public-private  partnerships  indicate  that  these  partners  usually
concern themselves solely with the letter  and  ignore  the  spirit  of  the
agreement. By doing so they are throwing away the  public  participation  of
the community. We cannot say more about the rush for profit.

The challenges and lessons emanating from  the  project  of  Kokstad  Prison
demand of us to refine  our  consultation  and  communication  methods  when
dealing with projects of this nature.

In conclusion, may I express my utter surprise and,  in  fact,  appreciation
for the attitude that was displayed by  the  officials  when  they  came  to
brief us. I have never heard of officials saying: ``We  are  well  resourced
in terms of the budget and other resources.'' [Applause.]

Mr M R MZOBE (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  hon  members  of  the  Council,
effective policing is a prerequisite for a law-abiding and  orderly  society
within which  the  lives  and  property  of  citizens  are  protected,  thus
allowing people to  pursue  their  everyday  lives  in  peace  and  harmony.
Therefore, law and order a prerequisite for the attainment  of  justice  and
equity in society.

While crime prevention remains the responsibility of the  entire  community,
community  policing  does  not  absolve  the  Government  from  its  primary
responsibility of maintaining law and order  and  fighting  crime.  Policing
should be goal-oriented, police  visibility  must  be  enhanced  within  the
community and petty crimes should  not  be  overlooked  while  concentrating
resources on more serious crimes. Serious policing of petty  crime  has  the
effect of reducing crime at all levels, as shown in New York City.

Police  recruitment  should  match  the  demographic  composition   of   the
population, and quality and merit  should  be  paramount  considerations  in
staffing. Notwithstanding the financial constraints, police officers  should
be paid fair work-related  salaries.  Despite  the  fact  that  we  have  an
insufficient number of police officers, they have nevertheless  demonstrated
their unwavering determination in executing their duties to such  an  extent
that they have been able  to  curtail  the  flames  of  violence  that  once
engulfed our country in its entirety.

South African prisons are filled to capacity because the  police  are  doing
an outstanding job. The police are systematically assassinated  from  right,
left and centre, particularly when they chase fleeing suspects.  I  find  it
most disturbing and extremely inconsiderate of the Constitutional  Court  to
rule that the police may no longer shoot at fleeing criminals. What  is  the
point of the police carrying firearms then? It is for  this  reason  that  I
support the notion that the Constitutional Court  might  as  well  take  the
firearms away from the police  and  hand  them  over  to  the  criminals  to
continue with their dirty work, given that the police can  only  shoot  when
they know that criminals have shot at or  killed  a  person  in  the  Police
Service.

The rule of law must be restored in South Africa. I am  very  grateful  that
the hon Ministers in the cluster are on top of  what  I  am  talking  about.
Though South Africa cannot transform its criminal justice system  overnight,
the justice system must, however, at all times  be  effective  and  open  to
all, provided that the Government has  the  will  to  achieve  its  intended
goals. Otherwise, nothing can be done, if the Government does not  have  the
will to do that which the Minister pursues even if the  hon  Minister  wants
to carry on with his job.

The Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  must  employ  a
sufficient amount of manpower so that cases are dealt with  accordingly  and
to create breathing space in prisons to curtail or eradicate completely  the
number of escapees.  The  Department  of  Correctional  Services,  with  the
assistance of its sister cluster departments, must build enough  prisons  to
provide sufficient  accommodation  for  prisoners  through  the  length  and
breadth of our country. It is extremely pleasing that hon Ministers are  not
told what to do, but are on top of what worries us and what  scares  foreign
investors.

Every opportunity should be taken to minimise the  likelihood  of  offenders
repeating their crimes and being incarcerated in prison on a  more  or  less
permanent basis. Rehabilitation is thus crucial in assisting prisoners in  a
life for themselves after their release and it must not be ignored for  fear
of  exacerbating,  rather  than  alleviating,  the  situation  our   crowded
prisons. So one is hopeful that the Ministers are on top of this.  Tomorrow,
or in the very  near  future,  we  will  see  the  curtailment  or  complete
eradication of what we saw last night.

I believe that Government  should  implement  the  programmes  dealing  with
working for a living in prison with moral acceptance of  responsibility  and
with community work during incarceration. I would like to  say  to  the  hon
Minister  and  his  colleagues  that  one  really   should   express   one's
gratefulness that the things we are talking about are already  in  progress,
the Minister is already addressing them. Therefore, we really need to  thank
him and his colleagues.

Governments throughout the world establish defence forces to  protect  their
respective foreign territories, hence the defence force  must  be  empowered
to fulfil its constitutional mandate through adequate state resourcing of  a
long-term defence acquisition programme. However,  the  defence  acquisition
programme should take into account the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  South
African  society,  its  position  on  the  subcontinent  and  its  economic,
ecological and maritime responsibilities.

In  other  words,  expenditure  must  match  the  threat  that  the  country
potentially faces. We must not let nations with prestige or status allow  us
to spend beyond our means on defence,  whilst  neglecting  the  overwhelming
poverty that the country faces.

Having said that, the  province  of  the  kingdom  of  KwaZulu-Natal  indeed
supports unconditionally the job well  done  by  the  clustered  Ministries,
headed by their hon Ministers. [Applause.]

Mr S SHICEKA (Gauteng): Chairperson,  Ministers,  NCOP  members,  colleagues
from the  different  provinces,  today  I  stand  in  this  House  with  the
intention of contributing to the budget debate for the fiscal year  2002-03.
I would also like to  pay  tribute  to  the  late  Minister  of  Safety  and
Security, Comrade Steve Vukile Tshwete, for his contribution and  dedication
to eradicating crime and criminality in our country.

The late Minister Tswete was gifted with, among other  things,  the  quality
of motivating and boosting the morale of those he  worked  with,  no  matter
what level they were at.  The  commitment  and  the  approach  of  the  late
Minister and his colleagues in the criminal  justice  cluster  has  produced
remarkable results. Minister Tshwete served this  country  and  this  nation
with  distinction,  and  deserves  this  salute  and  our  praise  for   his
selflessness and for being a true patriot until the end.

In keeping with the approach  outlined  in  the  National  Crime  Prevention
Strategy and the White Paper on Safety and Security, this debate requires  a
dual  approach  to  safety  and  security,  effective  and   efficient   law
enforcement and programmes to reduce the occurrence of crime at all  levels.
Our actions and interventions have proved beyond doubt that  there  is  what
we call effective monitoring and evaluation of police  performance.  Members
of the public with whom we continually engage will measure  our  performance
as a state.

The national justice, crime prevention and  security  cluster  has  come  up
with key strategic goals and priorities. In Gauteng the  strategy  is  being
implemented on two broad fronts,  ie  the  stabilisation  of  crime  levels,
stretching from 2001 to 2003; and the normalisation of crime situations.

The SAPS has identified certain strategic  goals  and  145  police  stations
have been prioritised - these stations account for more than 50% of  serious
crime. In Gauteng, 28 priority stations and two presidential  stations  were
identified. The number of priority stations have  now  been  reduced  to  20
owing to the fact that others have stabilised.

We  have  seen  a  downward  trend  in  serious  crimes  such   as   murder,
housebreaking,  breaking  into  business  premises,  the  theft   of   motor
vehicles, commercial crime, high-profile  aggravated  robbery  such  as  car
hijacking, the hijacking of trucks,  and  cash-in-transit  heists  and  bank
robberies. However, we are experiencing an upward trend in  crimes  such  as
theft, robbery and sexual abuse.

The stabilisation of and reduction in crime at eight of  these  stations  is
indeed an outstanding achievement of the police and other components of  the
criminal justice system. It is also an affirmation of the fact  that  whilst
a lot has to be done,  the  integration  process  of  the  criminal  justice
system, together with other law-enforcement agencies,  in  partnership  with
communities, has grown tremendously and  must  be  sustained.  However,  the
lack of joint planning and the poor sharing of information still have to  be
addressed if we are to succeed beyond the current levels.

In order to consolidate the  gains  made  at  these  stations,  one  of  the
challenges that we have to deal with  is  the  integration  of  SAPS  public
order policing into crime combating units to  conduct  continual  operations
such as roadblocks, cordons and searches. These units  will  be  established
in each of the identified areas to support  stations  and  help  hasten  the
process  of  crime  reduction.  In  those  areas  where  we  have   realised
stabilisation with regard to serious  crimes,  a  process  of  normalisation
will  be  implemented  through  the  development  and  implementation  of  a
multidisciplinary approach and partnership with the concerned role-players.

Although violence against women is not endemic to South Africa,  it  differs
both in frequency and type from the  violence  that  men  experience.  Women
are, for example, vulnerable to sexual abuse  and  attack  in  their  homes.
Violence against women and children has been and will continue  to  be  high
on our agenda at all levels of government.

We are impressed with the way in which society  has  started  to  break  the
silence and speak out against sexual abuse  and  domestic  violence.  Crimes
against  women  and   children   have   received   considerable   publicity,
particularly the rape  of  the  girl  child.  People  and  victims  are  now
prepared to speak out and report such incidents to the police.  As  for  the
rape of minor children, parents are called upon to increase  their  care  of
children. In most cases, children are left without care or  parents  forsake
their protective responsibility. Parenting education has to  be  intensified
at our maternity clinics, welfare institutions and other bodies. One of  the
key issues we have to strive for is family preservation. This  can  be  done
through working with communities of faith and with  various  community-based
organisations, focusing on ensuring  that  the  family  really  becomes  the
basic unit of society and of influence.

The struggle concerning the prevention of violence  against  women  must  be
pursued in tandem with the wider struggle  for  the  emancipation  of  women
broadly.  The  ultimate  success  of  this  struggle  lies  in   the   total
emancipation of society at large and also in equal access to  resources  and
all   levers   of   powers.   In   partnership   with   organizations    ...
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, on a point of order, if I  may:  Would
it, in fact, be correct for a speaker in the House to be referred to  by  an
unknown name and therefore  mislead  those  of  us  who  are  following  the
proceedings? Here we have the hon Shiceka addressing us, but I see  it  says
``Mzobe'' on the television screens. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I  thank  the  hon  the  Minister  for
drawing this  to  the  attention  of  those  who  are  responsible  for  the
technology out there. The hon member may continue. [Laughter.]

Mr S SHICEKA: Madam Chair, as part of ensuring  that  our  criminal  justice
system becomes effective and efficient, we will be evaluating the impact  of
diversion and rehabilitation programmes based on the  best-practice  models.
Our view  is  that  we  need  to  mobilise  communities,  including  justice
personnel, to make use of alternative sentencing models  in  order  to  deal
with the unacceptably high levels of overcrowding and allow  some  prisoners
to serve their sentences in communities.

One of the problems that  we  have  identified  during  our  monitoring  and
evaluation of the criminal  justice  system,  or  CJS,  is  the  problem  of
awaiting-trial prisoners, as has been said  by  many  people.  To  alleviate
this  problem,  a  study  to  determine  blockages   facing   awaiting-trial
prisoners in correctional institutions such as Johannesburg prisons will  be
undertaken. Based on the findings, recommendations will be made to  the  CJS
cluster, both provincially and nationally.

To ensure swift prosecution and the alleviation of  backlogs  in  cases,  in
Johannesburg the process of setting up municipal courts  to  deal  with  all
cases pertaining to bylaws and traffic fines is at  an  advanced  stage.  We
hope that the court will be operational before the end of this year.

In conclusion, with all  eyes  on  Johannesburg  for  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development,  our  law-enforcement  agencies  have  started  the
necessary preparations by drafting a security plan. We  are  confident  that
we will show the world that South Africa, and  Johannesburg  in  particular,
is capable of hosting such big events. We are in no doubt that we  shall  be
equal to the task. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Chair, the first thing I want  to
do is to highlight a matter that was raised, albeit  very  briefly,  by  the
hon Connie Seoposengwe. I suppose that the fact that she did not travel  any
distance with respect to the matter had to do with the  fact  that  she  did
not want to steal my thunder. She raised the issue  of  some  arrests  which
were made this morning. Early this morning police  from  the  Northern  Cape
mounted  raids  simultaneously  in  a  number  of  areas  in  Port  Nolloth,
Kimberley, Cape Town and Upington, and arrested 25  suspected  criminals  in
those raids. Later in the day, as a result of ongoing investigations,  eight
more people were arrested, giving a  total  of  33.  All  of  them  will  be
appearing in our courts tomorrow.

The matter has to do with activities relating to diamond dealing as well  as
other  related  illicit  activities.   The   operation,   called   Operation
Solitaire, was spearheaded  by  members  of  the  Diamond  and  Gold  Branch
working together with our crime intelligence units and  personnel  from  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional  Development.  As  we  speak,  more
arrests are expected. [Applause.]

Allow me, at this stage, to congratulate everyone who was  involved  in  the
operation on the sterling work they did and the clear message their  success
is sending to criminals of every type and kind right  through  our  country.
Well done! An important element of the successes we register  against  crime
is the support we continue to get from our communities. Operation  Solitaire
has received tremendous support from many civilians in  the  spirit  of  the
partnerships between our communities and the entire South  African  criminal
justice system.

I wish to inform hon members of this House that  on  Monday  last  week  the
police commenced an operation which is intended to ensure that our  National
Crime Prevention Strategy yields the successes we want it to.  Part  of  our
programme during the current financial year is the adoption of  measures  to
prevent the occurrence of social crime. I have already directed  the  police
to do a proper analysis of the crimes that occur in these  police  areas  to
determine which of them can be addressed by way of social  crime  prevention
and socioeconomic development programmes.
This matter will be taken forward in meetings that I intend to have  in  the
next three months with all the provinces and local authorities. This is  one
area where safety and security  MECs,  as  well  as  members  of  provincial
legislatures, can play  a  decisive  role.  The  causes  identified  can  be
addressed by way of programmes and strategies at  provincial  level  in  co-
operation with national structures. Many services,  such  as  education  and
welfare, are provided  and  co-ordinated  at  a  provincial  level  and  are
invaluable in addressing the root causes of crime.

In addition, all public order policing  units  are  being  transformed  into
area crime combating units that will conduct intelligence-driven  operations
which require high force levels. Incidentally, our breakthrough  in  respect
of the crimes that I referred to and the arrests we  have  made  had  to  do
with the fact  that  we  have  intelligence  structures  in  place  that  do
tremendous work. But the best intelligence officers one  will  have  at  any
point are our people, because they are the  repository  of  information  and
they have better information-gathering skills. Examples  of  these  will  be
parallel roadblocks on highways and secondary routes  and  cordon-and-search
operations. These are intended to  deal  effectively  with  bank  robberies,
cash-in-transit heists and the hijacking of vehicles, as well  as  taxi  and
gang violence, which remain a scourge in certain provinces.

The SAPS has already purchased 50  high-performance  vehicles  to  implement
the first phase of this approach in  all  provinces.  New  helicopters  have
also been acquired  to  provide  air  support  to  the  mobile  units.  This
capacity must be expanded further to make more inroads  against  crime,  and
we are currently addressing this matter.

The  department  has  been  reviewing  its   allocations   for   operational
expenditure. While  78%  of  the  budget  will  be  allocated  to  personnel
expenditure,  this  split  is  rational.  The  22%  that  is  destined   for
operations will allow us to fully  implement  our  strategic  plan  for  the
financial year.  The  budget  indicates  an  8,6%  increase  from  the  last
allocation and a 9,2% increase over the MTEF period.  That  8,6%  translates
into R1,2 billion, and that is the amount of money that is available  to  us
during this current financial year.

In respect of the annual allocation split between  national  structures  and
the provinces, I am indeed proud to inform this  House  that  65,4%  of  the
current financial year's budget has been allocated to  provinces  and  34,6%
to national structures. This compares most favourably  to  figures  for  the
entire national Government, which  reflect  a  split  between  national  and
provincial allocations of 40,5% and 59,5% respectively.

It must, however,  also  be  kept  in  mind  that  many  of  these  national
structures  function  within  the  provinces  as  decentralised   units.   I
specifically refer, in this regard, to units such as Public Order  Policing,
the Air Wing and other  specialised  functions  such  as  the  Special  Task
Force.  These  structures  all  conduct  their  duties  within  the  various
provinces in support of crime-combating operations and day-to-day policing.

The matter of our deployment in terms of  personnel  and  equipment  in  our
fight against crime was raised ably by Kgoshi Mokoena and I  therefore  want
to address myself briefly to it. The current allocation will  enable  us  to
enlist approximately 7 100 new recruits in the current financial year and  8
900 additional recruits in the next three years.  A  total  of  28  560  new
personnel will be appointed over the MTEF period, and by  the  end  of  that
period it is envisaged that the police establishment will therefore rise  to
147 560 members. The hon Dikeledi Magadzi also raised the  question  of  the
ratio between members and the population. In her case, in Limpopo -  or  the
Northern Province, as it is not officially Limpopo yet - the  ratio  is  one
member to 700 members of our population, while the international average  is
one member to 461 members of the public.

But in our situation in South Africa the ratio is slightly lower. It is  one
police member to 446 members of the population. It is our intention that  we
bring this into a better perspective through a better  balancing  programme.
In the end, we want it to be 1:438. But finally - and we believe we can  get
to this - we want it to be 1:400.

Of course, the question of gender was also raised  as  part  and  parcel  of
Kgoshi Mokoena's  input  regarding  our  transformation  exercise  and  with
respect to this there are some figures that I quickly want to bring  to  the
attention of this hon House. I will use the period  from  the  establishment
of the Police Service in 1995 to date. At that point of  transformation  the
matter was as follows with respect to senior management in the  service:  In
1995 only 1% at senior management level was  female  and  in  1999,  at  the
beginning of the life of the second Parliament, it was raised  a  little  to
4%. At this point 11% of the people deployed at our senior management  level
are female. With respect to middle management, in 1995 it was 3% female  and
in 1999 11%, and where we stand it is 16%.

At the two junior levels, the first level being 8-10, the  situation  is  as
follows: In 1995 it was 14% female and in 1999 it  was  18%,  and  where  we
stand it is 22%. The next junior level, which is  lower  than  the  level  I
have referred to, the situation in 1995 was that 20% of  the  contingent  at
that level were female, and in 1999 this increased  very  slightly  to  21%,
and where we are at now it is 24%. It is our desire  that  we  should  bring
all these matters into line  with  the  democratic  transformation  that  is
happening in our country. Therefore, more female members of the service  are
going to be promoted to these particular positions.

In terms of our recruitment drive, which I have referred  to,  some  of  the
people who we recruit will be deployed for  effective  policing  in  clearly
demarcated sectors. In the beginning, of course, we want to  concentrate  on
the 145 crime-policing areas that we have referred to. We want therefore  to
direct our new recruits there. These are people who will be visible,  highly
mobile and proactive, and people who will be carefully chosen so  that  they
are able to interface with people who are in those communities, in terms  of
our strategy of partnerships between our people and those who serve them  as
part and parcel of our desire to lend a hand to ensure that we  provide  our
people with a better life.

Sector policing will use, as a springboard  for  focused  attention  against
criminals, the successes of Operation Crackdown.  It  is  also  intended  to
establish  programmes  that  will  address  crime  through   a   series   of
multidisciplinary  initiatives.  The  hon  Leonard  Ramatlakane  has  raised
problems in the  Western  Cape.  Indeed  there  has  been  a  resurgence  of
gangsterism in the province. The SANDF has withdrawn some of the units  that
we had from that department assisting the police in their work. However,  we
have deployed people whose numbers may not be equal to  those  of  the  army
units that have been withdrawn, but the fact of the matter is that  we  have
provided these people with the resources so that they can do the  work  that
needs to be  done.  Of  course  we  are  going  to  continually  review  our
strategies and tactics in terms of this particular issue.

I want to refer to a matter which was raised by the hon  Piet  Matthee  with
respect to a meeting we had with members of  the  New  NP.  We  welcome  the
encouraging remarks that he made with respect to that incident.

As the members may have seen, newspaper headlines in the past few days  have
raised the issue of farm killings. There are various people, from  political
commentators who are independent to politicians, some of  whom  are  members
of our Parliament, whose comments have been, in the  first  instance,  quite
caustic. Others have related farm killings to what they say  is  failure  on
the part of the Government with respect to this particular matter.

Those comments go on to say that a report was compiled on  this  matter  and
is lying on my desk because it is either unattended to  or  because  we  are
unwilling to release it for public consumption. The truth is that  there  is
no such report. These are  false  allegations.  On  5  April  last  year  my
predecessor, the hon Steve Tshwete, appointed a  committee,  headed  by  Adv
Charl du Plessis, to investigate farm attacks. My  Government  is  concerned
about the murder of any of our people. As a matter of  fact,  our  President
addressed this particular issue this afternoon saying that our people  would
not be threatened with death and killed, that and ``our people''  meant  the
entire South African population. He  said  that  nobody  had  the  right  to
murder one of our people. Singing that tune is consistent  on  the  part  of
our Government.

Barely a week after my appointment I directed communication to the  head  of
the committee investigating farm murders to ask what  the  status  of  their
inquiry was. They responded promptly. My letter was written on  13  May  and
on 15 May I got a response which indicated how mammoth the task was that  we
had asked them to do. Precisely because it is such a huge  obligation,  they
have not been able to complete their work and there  are  reasons  why  they
have not been able to. One of the important things  they  want  to  do  once
they have completed the inquiry is that, like true South Africans,  they  do
not just want to whinge, but to provide us with a way  forward  and  with  a
process in which we can resolve this particular problem. That report is  not
available yet but there are people working on it, and I am sure we will  get
it in time to come.
Given that firearms are a major factor in  the  commission  of  serious  and
violent crimes, we  have  allocated  R50  million  of  our  budget  for  the
implementation of the Firearms Control  Act.  We  have  appointed,  to  that
extent, approximately 300 additional designated  firearm  officers  to  take
charge of the matter. We have also increased our IT capacity  regarding  the
matter and have acquired more vehicles  to  increase  the  mobility  of  our
members.

Crimes against women and children have featured  quite  prominently  in  our
debates in our Parliament.  Assistance  from  many  sources,  including  the
business community,  has  enabled  the  Police  Service  to  improve  victim
empowerment services - a matter which was  raised  in  the  context  of  the
debate in this House today by, I think, Kgoshi  Mokoena  -  especially  with
regard to women and children, particularly the  girl  child.  This  includes
the establishment of more than  80  additional  victim  support  centres  at
various police stations. The effort to create an  environment  conducive  to
confidentiality during the interview process in respect of  sexual  offences
is ongoing. A proactive approach, however, is still necessary if we  are  to
reduce the number of victims. We have to be proactive and stop these  crimes
from happening. This is particularly so in respect of rape.
The police have identified 128 station areas that contribute  more  or  less
50% of the national rape statistics in our country.  Special  projects  will
be implemented in these  areas  to  give  effect  to  the  interdepartmental
antirape strategy of the National Prosecuting Authority, the Departments  of
Health and Social Development and the SA Police Service.

These projects will focus on increasing the number  of  units  dealing  with
family violence, child protection and  sexual  offences  of  the  SA  Police
Service. To this extent we have given a large chunk of our budget  in  order
for us to engage such members of the Police Service, train them  and  ensure
that they are equipped fully in order for them  to  fight  this  scourge.  I
believe that this will go a long way  in  assisting  both  the  victims  and
investigators in bringing the perpetrators to book.

We also have a victim support programme which will  be  expanded  to  assist
victims during the criminal justice process. A recent  docket  analysis  has
indicated that more than 40% of rape cases were withdrawn at the request  of
the victims. The tendency must be turned around and justice  must  take  its
course. There are several reasons that contribute to the withdrawal of  this
type of case.

Of course we also have a programme on prevention and public education  which
we will launch. In this regard, a comprehensive research programme is  under
way to determine the profiles of the offenders,  their  belief  systems  and
the  reasons  for  the  crimes  they  commit  in   order   to   ensure   the
implementation of focused preventive action. This is obviously necessary  in
order for us to have an all-encompassing strategy that  we  will  employ  to
fight these particular crimes.

In addition, the department, along with its  partners  in  the  cluster  and
other government departments such as  Social  Development  and  Health,  has
embarked on a process of erecting nine one-stop  community  safety  centres.
These  centres  are  designed  to  provide  an  integrated  service  to  the
community. For example, a victim of crime would only have to travel to  this
centre to get all the necessary assistance. He or she would be able  to  get
treatment at the clinic, lay  formal  charges  at  the  police  station  and
attend trials at court - all in one location. This is based  on  the  system
of one-stop-based services.
There are centres, therefore, at Thembalethu in the  Western  Cape,  Kentani
in the Eastern Cape, Leboeng in Limpopo, Khutsong in  Gauteng  and  Nsimbini
in KwaZulu-Natal, which have all been completed. At  Tshidilamolomo  in  the
North West construction is in progress and the centre  should  be  completed
next month.  The  centre  at  Galeshewe  in  the  Northern  Cape  should  be
completed by November 2003, while construction of a second  centre  in  that
province will be located at Augrabies. Construction will commence after  the
first centre has been completed.

At Thabang - sorry, Thabong - in the Free State, site verification is  still
in progress and construction should commence in the next financial  year.  I
was wondering why it was ``Thabang''; I thought that it had to do  with  the
hon Makwetla. [Laughter.] This is a typographical error. The  only  province
in which a community safety centre has not been established  is  Mpumalanga.
The reasons for this are that a suitable site  could  not  be  verified  and
that there was nonperformance on the part of  the  appointed  consultant  to
compile a business plan. So we want to encourage the MEC from Mpumalanga  to
take charge of this process so that a centre is also established there.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  Minister,  would  you  be  kind
enough to wrap up, because I think your time has almost expired.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: I have three sentences left. The  first
one is that our structures for the advancement of our democracy,  which  are
operating within our service, are in place and working  well,  that  is  the
Independent Complaints Directorate as  well  as  our  national  Secretariat.
These structures are approached regularly for  assistance  to  international
structures of the same kind.

The last point is that I will be happy if members go back home and  mobilise
everybody behind our programme to fight against crime. This is not a  party-
political football. It is a matter where all  of  us  should  unite  because
crime relates to all of our people. The criminals will not  attack  one  for
being a member of the DP. They will not attack one for belonging to the  New
NP or the ANC. Criminals attack people, and in order for  us  to  turn  this
around, let us unite our resources,  human  and  material,  to  defeat  this
scourge. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, I do not want to  detain
colleagues here much longer. We have said a lot, really. What I need to  say
is that I want to thank all those members  who  have  contributed  and  also
those who sat and listened. We appreciate an audience.

I have said  a  few  words  about  the  hon  member  Lubidla  and  expressed
appreciation for her motion. I also appreciate the suggestions made  by  the
hon Lever and I hope that my officials who were  here  when  he  spoke  took
those points down. It is quite a long list.

The hon Magadzi's concerns about the  dangerous  criminals  being  put  with
juveniles are noted. We will  also  look  into  that.  I  think  the  policy
remains that they should not be combined, but rather separated. I know  that
because of overcrowding it does happen, in some cases,  that  they  are  put
together, but it is sometimes simply a case of neglect of duty.

I appreciate also the points raised by the hon Seoposengwe, but she  shocked
me a little bit when she said that I  should  watch  television  tonight.  I
thought:  My  God,  after  seeing  what  I  saw  last   night?   [Laughter.]
[Interjections.] I nearly ran out. Must I, of all people, go back  to  that?
I also appreciate the points raised by the hon Ramatlakane  with  regard  to
corruption and also the treatment of inmates. I  think  we  will  also  look
into that.

I will look into what both the hon Maloyi and  Prince  Zulu  said.  The  hon
Mkhaliphi  made  several  points  on  safe  custody  with  the  reason   for
imprisonment, which is  a  historical  fact  about  prisons  throughout  the
world. Why do we imprison people? We will try to answer that  one  too.  The
health situation  of  children  will  also  be  addressed.  I  think  it  is
important for me to deal with Rev Makwaza's point  quickly,  because  if  we
are talking about rehabilitation, it  is  not  only  physical,  it  is  also
spiritual. If we have somebody wanting to help spiritually, then we need  to
take that up.

On the issue of babies in prison, we have no choice. There  are  people  who
are arrested and come into prison already  pregnant.  They  have  babies  in
prison. The policy is that the babies should be there for at least three  to
five years. They are kept separate.  In  fact,  we  are  trying  to  promote
preschools and crÃ¨ches in prison, so that they can  be  taught  during  that
time. If one takes the baby from the mother at a few months old and puts  it
somewhere else, what is going to happen? What we  are  saying  is  that  our
policy is that the baby should be there with the mother  until  the  age  of
three to five. The family can then take care of the baby or the baby can  be
adopted. It is a difficult situation where one cannot  tell  the  mother  to
leave the baby after two months. It is a sad state of affairs. It is  not  a
simple matter of simply telling her not to have a baby there in prison.  She
must have the baby, and then we should take care of the  baby  and  all  the
rest until the baby can be adopted.

A point was raised about the PPPs, that is the public-private  partnerships.
I think we will also want to deal with that  issue.  A  number  of  concerns
were raised about the profit motive and also some political and  ideological
issues around that. I must also say generally that these  benefit  not  only
only  those  who  have  acquired  the   contract,   but   also   the   small
businesspeople around there who have shares in  those  institutions.  We  do
not want to say that people must be perpetual labourers. At some point  they
have to own shares in an institution like that one. We will deal  with  that
one also and try and advance some reasons. We will try.

Issues regarding Kokstad were raised. I do not think I had any  option.  The
building was being built. It was planned, designed and I  found  it  already
being built. I could not say, ``No, do not continue.'' A lot of  people  had
been employed and they were building the prison because we wanted a  prison,
despite the fact that the original planning was not that good.  I  think  we
had to decide whether we wanted the prison or not. In the face of this  kind
of overcrowding and high levels of crime I  thought  we  needed  to  have  a
prison.

I think I have answered Mr Mzobe's point about  building  more  prisons.  We
had to build Kokstad, but we cannot, as Government, build ourselves  out  of
overcrowding. No country has ever done that. We cannot do it at the rate  at
which we are arresting people. My  colleague  the  Minister  of  Safety  and
Security came to me and jokingly said, ``Well,  Mhlanga,  I  have  some  bad
news for you.'' He knew that in the criminal justice system I am always  the
one who gets bad news. [Laughter.] He went on to say: ``I'm going  to  flood
your prisons with people.'' I thought: ``My  God!  Here  it  comes  again.''
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  Minister,  could  you  wrap  up,
please.

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Well, I think you are saying that  am
enjoying myself, Chairperson. [Interjections.]

I think what the hon member Shiceka  said  about  community  corrections  is
correct. These are the kinds of options we are looking at, and we  are  also
looking at those blockages and  identifying  them,  with  the  Minister  for
Justice and Constitutional  Development  and  the  Minister  of  Safety  and
Security. The Minister  of  Defence  was  also  promising  us  some  of  the
buildings that they used before, which are, in a way, ready  to  accommodate
some people, but need changes here and there. It  is  question  of  planning
and logistics to see how we can do it. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, in the limited time we  have,  I  will
not deal with all the  issues.  I  will  select  some  that  really  require
attention.

First of all, let me just say that I have a rejoinder to what  my  colleague
Charles Nqakula has just said about the particular issue of the  noise  that
has been heard around the country on the ``Kill the boer, kill the  farmer''
slogan. This House constitutes part of the leadership of the nation  and  it
is important that this House should speak with  one  voice  on  this  issue.
There can be no excuse for this House to  prevaricate  on  a  question  like
that, when we require to unite the people of our country. Of course  it  has
got to be a properly constituted  motion.  The  House  must  speak  as  one.
[Interjections.] No, members should not tease each other on  an  issue  that
requires the House to be united. [Interjections.]

The issues that I would really like  to  address  are  those  that  die  agb
Theron opgetel het [the hon Theron  picked  up].  On  the  question  of  the
budget for Defence, no one should be clearer on this issue than  members  of
Parliament. When this democratic Government came  into  being,  this  nation
was spending more than 9% of its total expenditure on  defence.  Since  then
we have brought it down to 6%  of  the  nation's  total  expenditure,  which
means that 94% of the nation's total expenditure goes to other issues.

Let us take it the  other  way  round.  On  average  around  the  world,  in
peacetime, nations spend on average 2% of their GDP on defence.  Since  this
democratic Government came into being, we have brought expenditure  down  to
less than 2% of GDP, as  I  stand  here,  including  the  strategic  defence
package. We are spending 1,7% of our GDP on defence, which  means  98,3%  of
our nation's GDP goes into other expenditure. From  reading  the  newspapers
of this country, one might believe that we are spending 64% of  the  GDP  on
defence. [Laughter.] I can assure hon members of that.

That is what happens. People say that we must not compare the  past  and  we
must move away from  apartheid.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is:  We  cannot
understand the present and the future without history. Even when one is  ill
and goes to the doctor, the doctor asks: Where do you come from?  Where  did
you grow up? Did your parents have this illness?  There  is  no  way  he  is
going to understand  how  to  deal  with  you  without  asking.  History  is
crucial. What we are dealing with in politics is also that.

The second thing I would like to deal with, also raised by the  hon  Theron,
is the issue of Burundi. It is a total fallacy to say that South  Africa  is
funding the mission out there. That mission is not a classic UN mission.  It
is endorsed by the Security Council, which means that the  UN  has  said  to
the nations of the world that, although the conditions  ordinarily  required
under the Charter of the UN have not been entirely  fulfilled,  nevertheless
we endorse this action  being  taken  by  those  African  nations  that  are
satisfied that they can make a contribution. The UN went on to say  that  it
encouraged formations to support this. The EU pledged huge contributions  of
money - I cannot provide the figures off the cuff. Belgium, over  and  above
what it contributes to the EU, also pledged a further amount  directly  from
its own budget.

The Netherlands contributed 40 million  guilders.  The  United  Kingdom  and
United States have pledged money. The United Nations itself is  working  out
its contribution, even though this is not its classical mission.  Only  last
week, Denmark pledged money to this. All we have done  is  to  ask  National
Treasury to advance the requisite money so that we do not have to  wait  for
the pledges and can  do  the  work.  When  that  money  comes,  it  will  be
recovered from that. We will only know at  some  future  point  whether  the
money contributed by the  international  community  is  less  than  what  is
required. But I am quite satisfied with the work that the former  President,
Mr Mandela, is doing. There will not be any shortage on that.  That  is  why
the Deputy President was right in assuring both the  National  Assembly  and
this House on this question.

But South Africans must also move away  from  the  question  of  complaining
about contributing R1 million to peace support missions. Mali, for  example,
is a very small nation and it is poor. It could not  even  host  the  Africa
Cup of Nations without our support. We had to have Kombis and  other  things
sent there to assist them. But when it comes to supporting  peace  missions,
they have five full batallions set aside for nothing else but peace  support
operations. South Africa complains  about  one  batallion  to  Burundi  when
there is another battalion in reserve here. We cannot do that.

We have to remember the role that  the  international  community  played  in
supporting our struggle for democracy  in  this  country.  Nations  gave  us
money directly, and some of them contributed with the  lives  of  their  own
citizens. South Africa must keep that in mind, otherwise we would be  making
a serious mistake.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  Minister,  could  you  wrap  up,
please?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: I just want to add that we are not going  to  do  a
defence review. A defence review is not something that one undertakes  every
week. It is done once for a long period of time to come. It is not going  to
happen now. But we need defence, not only because we are  likely  to  go  to
war. We have 3Â 000 km of coastline along which we have  marine  resources  -
fish and so on. We have to police it, and we cannot do  that  with  a  spear
and knobkerrie. [Laughter.] [Applause.] We need to have ships,  helicopters,
corvettes and so on. Those  cost  money.  Without  those  marine  resources,
there would be no food or work for South Africans. There would not  even  be
areas of research.

Finally, let me just say  that  people  do  not  understand  that  the  drug
syndicates, the criminal syndicates that are there  today,  command  budgets
bigger than this nation's. For instance, we cannot  compare  ourselves  with
Al-Qaeda. Some of these  traffickers  that  are  bringing  drugs  here  from
Colombia have ships, ocean liners and submarines which are fast and  modern.
We have to stop them. The Minister of Safety and Security and  the  Minister
for Justice and Constitutional Development can bear me out. We are  catching
these guys and we cannot say how many are passing  by.  They  have  advanced
equipment. If we are to deal with them, we have to be  a  country,  even  in
peacetime, capable of looking after itself. There is 3Â 000 km  of  coastline
that we have to look after, and I am not talking  about  movement  from  the
north.

I am sorry that time is limited, but with the things I have to say  to  this
House, I could speak until nine o'clock. [Laughter.] I must thank the  House
for all the support we have had. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  I
personally have no doubt that we have had a very  good  debate  collectively
on the Budget Votes of our cluster. As a cluster, we  want  to  commend  the
members of this House for this good debate.

It is unavoidable, however, that I should make a few  comments  with  regard
to a few observations made by hon members. The  first  one  relates  to  the
observation by Kgoshi Mokoena that there are divergent  views  or  forms  of
construction regarding sentences, etc, in our courts. I would like  to  tell
Kgoshi Mokoena that this is unavoidable. In our system there  are  seats  of
the High Court in  so  many  places.  Judges  will  come  to  all  sorts  of
conclusions. But, fortunately in our  system  once  again,  we  have  higher
courts so that these positions will be distilled, either in  the  course  of
the work of the Supreme Court of Appeal or in that of the  court  that  sits
at the pinnacle of the system, that is, the Constitutional Court, where  our
Chief Justice is located. So we should not be alarmed by  the  existence  of
divergent views in respect of a whole range of matters.

The second question that Kgoshi Mokoena raised related to delays,  with  the
SAPS blaming the national prosecuting authority and those  together  blaming
the rest of the criminal justice system. Kgoshi  Mokoena  will  be  glad  to
note that precisely because we are operating in a totally new way, by  which
we have pulled down the walls of the silos that existed in this  system  and
have set up what we call the integrated justice court centres, we  all  have
ample opportunity not only to interact and look at the factors that lead  to
these delays but also to address those factors. The situation  is  improving
tremendously. We might find, occasionally, one or two officers who  lay  the
blame for these delays at the door of someone else, but the tendency now  is
to accept that the delays are multifaceted and have  many  causes  and  that
they are our responsibility as this cluster. That is our approach to them.
The hon Piet Matthee is  right  in  saying  that  there  are  all  sorts  of
perceptions about us as an unsafe country as well as  a  country  with  high
rates of corruption. But it is interesting to note that when people look  at
the crime scene in the world objectively, they  come  to  totally  different
conclusions. Indeed, one may be tempted to agree with the hon  Matthee  that
we might want to go to people who have the resources and ask: What  more  do
we have to do?

The truth is that South Africa stands in a very interesting position in  the
world context. In one sense we are a developing country, and yet in  another
sense, and a very important one, we are a rival to many developed  countries
in many areas. And it suits some of them to want to portray that  old  image
of us being unable to resolve these problems, but I do want to believe  that
honest people in the world,  including  ordinary  people,  will  acknowledge
that South Africa is doing the right  thing  and  addressing  her  problems.
That is why hon members here have been able to say  that  it  is  recognised
that things are changing.

I want to believe that, for instance, we are safer than the Middle  East.  I
am not expecting anybody, as I go out now to have my  whiskey  and  whatever
else at the next place, to walk in and blow himself up  and  therefore  kill
all of us there. I am not expecting anybody to raid us. There  is  no  Jenin
situation around here right now. Nobody is building  a  wall  to  shield  us
from them right now. It is not happening in the Republic  of  South  Africa,
and that is a reality. That is thanks to the total and  absolute  commitment
of all our people to doing the right thing.

The  hon  Lever  quite  correctly  observes  that  the  Justice  budget   is
insufficient.  I  said  to  the  National  Assembly  that   a   professional
assessment puts us  at  the  point  where  we  would  require  at  least  an
additional R2 billion to be able to do what has to be done. Again,  what  we
all have to acknowledge  is  that  there  is  a  large  body  of  legitimate
competing demands out there. As departments we have to accept that  we  have
to make do with the resources that the people of the RSA have placed at  our
disposal.

We may feel quite aggrieved about the paucity of resources, but  I  want  to
say that all the things that hon members have acknowledged are  being  done,
are being done notwithstanding the paucity of resources. We must  thank  the
people who manage the system - the commissioners, directors-general,  etc  -
because they have the toughest of jobs, to stretch these  resources  out  so
much and yet achieve the bit that we are achieving as a country.

The hon member asks: What is the point, in the face of all  these  problems,
of enacting legislation when we cannot implement it?  I  disagree  with  the
hon member. The pieces of legislation that he has  mentioned  in  particular
are examples of  what  this  country  needs  if  we  are  to  transform  the
situation. We cannot wait until we have an avalanche of resources before  we
pass those laws. We will  pass  them  and  look  for  resources  within  the
constraints of the budget and do our work.

A very exciting example is that the maintenance  system  has  not  collapsed
because we could not not appoint investigators hitherto.  But  I  have  said
here that we have set money aside that will enable us to  make  a  beginning
as far as the implementation of that part of the law is concerned. So  there
are many laws that  we  are  implementing  notwithstanding  the  paucity  of
resources.

This country  does  need  to  proceed  along  the  road  of  transformation,
notwithstanding our resources. We cannot say to  our  people  that  we  will
postpone certain aspects of sorely required  transformation  because  we  do
not have resources. They will not listen to that. They want change  and  the
assurance that change is taking place, resources  notwithstanding.  We  will
use whatever we have at our disposal to achieve these basic objectives  that
we have set ourselves as the people of the RSA.

The issue of corruption in correctional services has been mentioned.  Unlike
the Minister, I am actually going to state it much  more  strongly  and  say
that we are the ones who are exposing these things. I do  not  know  whether
hon members noted  that  these  prisoners  did  not  have  their  own  video
machine. The video machine was actually sourced from  somewhere  because  we
wanted to do a test and establish what is happening. There was  co-operation
by some of the officers in the system in order for  us  to  be  able  to  do
that.

If hon members do not know, a video machine is not a small machine,  so  one
would need the collaboration of quite a number  of  people  to  be  able  to
place it where it was in order for  us  to  get  to  know  what  was  really
happening. I want to say to this House that having done all that and  having
discovered a lot of rot in the system,  our  hands  are  not  tied.  We  are
acting against these anima  ...  I  mean,  these  elements.  I  nearly  said
``animals''. I have too many animals which are well-behaved to compare  them
to these elements. But honestly, this is our  work.  It  is  not  as  though
somebody at SABC3 did this. They did not do it, we gave the video  to  them.
It is our video. It comes from us. That must be borne in mind. This  is  our
work and it is part of ongoing work.

There is work we are doing now, together with the  Minister,  alongside  the
work of the Jali commission to deal with these problems. We  are  not  going
to wait, fold our arms or, for that matter, lie on our backs on  some  sandy
beach and say we will wait for Jali to tell us what we know is happening  so
that we can address it. As this cluster of Ministers, and  as  this  cluster
of directors-general and officials, we are addressing those problems.

This country, as I have said in the past, is served by some of  the  noblest
and finest of people who are asking for nothing  more  than  just  a  little
word of gratitude from me and this House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
                    PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY LEVIES BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, I want to say thank you very much, on behalf  of
this committee, for work that has been well done, and the  manner  in  which
hon members have conducted themselves this afternoon. I  want  to  table  my
report and just say, on behalf of the committee, that we support  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, when our Constitution  demands  equality  before
the law and speaks out against any form of  discrimination,  these  are  not
meaningless, lightly spoken, by-the-way  remarks.  In  the  Bill  there  are
three criteria determined for the levies. We have a problem with  the  third
criterion, which refers to the monthly gross income of the security  service
provider.

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, on a point of order:  I  thought  that  the  hon
member was going to say that his party was not in support of the  Bill,  but
not that he was going to give a speech, because I was the  only  person  who
was to give a speech.

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  member,  are  you  making  a
declaration?

Mr J L THERON: I am definitely making a declaration, Chairperson, and  I  am
motivating why we are saying this.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Please continue.

Mr J L THERON: Thank you, Chairperson. We  regard  the  criterion  of  gross
income as the determinant of a levy as very unfair, and  we  debated  it  at
very great length in the meetings where  we  had  the  opportunity.  Various
providers, depending on their location and the  type  of  service  provided,
will have different overheads and expenses. There are sound reasons why  our
whole taxation system - and this levy is nothing but a tax  -  is  based  on
taxable income, thus profit, after deductions. I do  not  think  I  need  to
elaborate on the unfair consequences of using gross income as  a  criterion.
Therefore we oppose this Bill. [Interjections.]

Bill  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party dissenting).

The Council adjourned at 19:53.
