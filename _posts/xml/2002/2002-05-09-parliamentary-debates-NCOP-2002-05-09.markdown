                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I give notice that  I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) on 8 May, Mr A E van Niekerk was involved in an accident in the rural
       area on the main road to Paarl, when he could not prevent  hitting  a
       woman crossing the road in the dark;


  (2) he stood there trying to comfort her in her pain with a group  of  at
       least 15 co-workers, who all had to cross the  same  road  under  the
       same circumstances and who were merely lucky not  to  have  been  run
       over by other cars;


  (3) Mr Van Niekerk and his colleagues in the New NP  are  convinced  that
       the fact that most people who die on our roads are pedestrians cannot
       be tolerated or accepted, that additional action must  be  taken  and
       that an investigation must be conducted into the possibility of -


       (a)  a  private  member's  legislative  proposal  to  strengthen  the
           present legislation on this issue;


       (b)  approaching organised agriculture to involve employers  next  to
           main roads to issue employees with fluorescent bands as part  of
           their protective clothing and to look into transport  facilities
           to cross these roads in the dark where bridges do not exist; and


       (c)  investigating the present situation on pedestrian crossings  and
           possible expansions of these facilities;


  (4) Mr Van Niekerk has expressed his gratitude and that of his  party  to
       Supervisor Titus and Inspector Mpiti of the  Traffic  Department  for
       the professional way in which they cared for the  injured  woman  and
       the way in which they assisted him; and


  (5) Mr Van Niekerk also wants to  thank  the  hon  Dr  Phillip  Nel,  who
       stopped at the scene and in his dress suit  examined  the  woman  and
       comforted her as much as he could ...

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, the comments in relation to safety and  the  role
of pedestrians as a contributing factor to deaths on our roads is  certainly
significant, but to go on about the detail of who has helped the hon  member
and why he helped him and the circumstances certainly do not  form  part  of
the basis of a notice of motion. I just want to  caution  the  member  about
that in future.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  But  there  is
no basis on which you can disallow that notice of motion. I agree  with  you
that there may be some petty things, but  unfortunately  the  Rules  do  not
allow you to stop the giving of notice of a motion.

Mr M E SURTY: May I with respect then state that that is not a motion but  a
statement by the member, Chairperson?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! No, it will  be
notice of a motion, because there is nothing like that  in  our  Rules.  You
can deal with that in the Whippery. I agree with what you  are  saying,  but
unfortunately this is notice of a motion.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of
the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) believes that the enlightened education of our children in the  basic
       facts of human biology and sexuality is essential  for  an  informed,
       responsible and humane society;


  (2) further believes that such education in  our  public  schools  has  a
       special urgency in the context of the Aids epidemic; and


  (3) therefore calls  on  the  Minister  of  Education  to  encourage  sex
       education in our schools.

                                ASCENSION DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that today is Ascension Day and that it is the day according to
       the Christian faith, belief and  tradition  that  is  celebrated  and
       recognised by most denominations as  the  day  that  the  Lord  Jesus
       Christ ascended to heaven; and


  (2) takes note of this day as Christians throughout the  world  go  about
       observing their faith and wishes them well.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     AIDS CARE UNIT AT CONRADIE HOSPITAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) applauds the installation of an Aids Care Unit at  Conradie  Hospital
       in a joint venture with St Luke's Hospital in the Western Cape;


  (2) notes that certain parts of Conradie Hospital have  been  transformed
       into a care unit for Aids patients;


  (3) appreciates that the facility will offer comfort and specialised care
       to Aids patients in the final stages of the disease;


  (4) notes with appreciation that funding of this facility is provided  by
       the  Government  and  that  medical,  pharmaceutical  and  logistical
       support is provided by Conradie Hospital; and


  (5) applauds such a move as a true example of dedication, vision, courage
       and integrity and as part of the many-pronged effort to  control  the
       HIV epidemic in this province.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  dat twee van die agb lid mnr Adriaan  van  Niekerk  se  kinders,

  (4) hulle baie sterkte toewens en die hoop uitspreek dat hulle weer  eens
       Suid-Afrika se naam hoog sal hou in hierdie besondere sportsoort.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion without notice follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  on 4 May 2002, two of the hon member Mr  Adriaan  van  Niekerk's
           children, Sjan-Mari and Iaan van Niekerk,  participated  in  the
           International Open Karate Kickboxing Tournament in New York; and

           gold, one silver and one bronze medal;


  (2) congratulates them on these excellent achievements;


  (3) further notes that on 11 May 2002 these  two  young  people  will  be
       participating in the karate kickboxing world championship  tournament
       in Orlando, Florida; and


  (4) wishes them lots of success and expresses the  hope  that  they  will
       once again hold South Africa's name high in this particular  code  of
       sport.]
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  DETERIORATING SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND EFFORTS TO FIND A LASTING
                              PEACEFUL SOLUTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I rise to  debate  a  matter  of
great importance to this country in the context of  the  commitment  of  all
South Africans, of all religious persuasions and of all  colours  to  commit
themselves to ensuring that there is peace and stability  on  our  continent
and in other parts of the world. Chairperson, you may note  from  the  title
...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Chief  Whip,
you must move your motion first, as printed on the Order Paper.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Thank  you,  Chairperson.  That  was  just  a
preamble to the motion itself.
I move the draft resolution printed in  my  name  on  the  Order  Paper,  as
follows:


  (1) the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Middle East, occasioned by
       Israeli state aggression against the state and people  of  Palestine,
       including the killing and maiming of civilians;


  (2) the occupation of Palestinian  land  and  territory  by  the  Israeli
       government;


  (3) the violation by the Israeli government of UN Human  Rights  treaties
       and the Geneva Convention and protocols on the treatment of civilians
       and prisoners of war;


  (4) the efforts of the Arab states, the United Nations, the  UN  Security
       Council and several other governments, including  the  Government  of
       South Africa, to finding a lasting peaceful solution  in  the  Middle
       East;


  (5) the refusal of the Israeli  government  to  permit  UN  observers  to
       investigate the events in Jenin; and


  (6) the progress in regard to resolving  an  impasse  in  the  Church  of
       Nativity in Bethlehem.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Are  all  the
provinces in agreement with this motion?

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, on a point of order, is it possible to  amend  this
motion before we proceed with the vote by provinces?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  L  Mushwana):  Which  province  is
that, hon member?

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I am asking as a member of this House, having  been
presented with the motion for the first ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Could  you  ask  your
province to move such a request, hon member? It is a provincial  matter.  If
you ask your province to suggest an amendment, then the Chief Whip,  as  the
mover of the motion, will give  an  indication  as  to  whether  or  not  he
accepts the proposal.

Ms C BOTHA: Thank you,  Chairperson.  May  I  then  read  out  the  proposed
amendment which I would like our province to move?

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, on a point of order, your ruling  has  been  very
clear. In terms of the Rules it is not possible for  the  individual  member
to make an amendment to a motion where a provincial vote is  required.  That
member should have put this to her delegation and the delegation head  could
have stood up and made an amendment. They  have  not  done  that,  and  this
House must not be asked to listen to that.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Could  we
follow the Rules? In terms of our Rules and our practices, only  a  province
regarding this type of matter can vote  or  propose  an  amendment.  I  have
suggested that the member put the proposal to her own province and then  her
province can move an amendment.

In the absence of any province  moving  or  making  any  suggestion  or  any
objection, I will take it that all  provinces  are  in  agreement  with  the
motion and that the motion is agreed to  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution. We shall now proceed to deal with the subject for discussion.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I wish to raise a point of  order:  We  were  given
from Tuesday until today to make our changes to  the  proposed  motion.  The
Whip would come back to us as a party in connection with this  motion.  This
is not ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Hon  member,  I  have
made a ruling on this matter and we cannot deliberate on it. We now  proceed
to deal with the subject for discussion as printed on the Order Paper.

  PALESTINE: A STRUGGLE FOR SELF-DETERMINATION, FREEDOM, HUMAN DIGNITY AND
                                    PEACE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, may I just  correct  a  somewhat
unintended, I think, misrepresentation of the situation? The  basis  of  the
discussion amongst the Whippery was  that  a  resolution  would  be  adopted
after this debate. That document was circulated and there was  communication
between the DP and the ANC on the basis  that  if  we  did  not  accept  the
proposals, then such a resolution would not be put to the  House,  and  that
would be the case. It did not deal with the motion  that  is  on  the  Order
Paper. I would like to rectify the situation and say  that,  certainly,  the
remarks of the hon Ms Botha are not consistent with the facts. Mr  Lever  is
invited to confirm or differ from me in this regard. I see he is here.
Chairperson, you may notice that the title of the subject of our  discussion
is ``Palestine: A struggle for self-determination,  freedom,  human  dignity
and peace''. Now, fundamental  and  central  to  our  Constitution  are  the
founding values that underpin our  Constitution,  those  of  human  dignity,
freedom and equality.

The basis of this debate here should be seen in the context of a  people  or
a nation whose dignity  is  suppressed,  who  are  restricted  in  terms  of
movement, in terms of access, in terms of opportunity within  the  territory
which they rightfully should call their own. This is  the  context  and  the
background in which we should debate this matter.

At the same time, there should be unequivocal  commitment  to  peace,  to  a
spirit in terms of which we commit ourselves, universally, to achieve  peace
by getting the parties together in order to find a  solution,  which  is  in
the best interests of the people of Palestine and the people of Israel.

The deteriorating situation in the  Middle  East  prompted  many  people  in
South Africa to adopt a programme of mass action in solidarity  and  support
of  the  besieged  Palestinian  people.  There  was  participation  in  this
programme by people from the working class, and  by  people  from  different
religious denominations and political persuasions. It is  a  programme  that
commenced not very long ago, which took place in the  various  provinces  of
our country. The commitment to peace and the solidarity with the  people  of
Palestine was quite universal in the  context  of  the  demonstrations  that
occurred countrywide.

South Africans began their campaign for support with interfaith prayers  for
peace, and with services, rallies and marches in our provinces. We  call  on
all  South  Africans  to  join  the  people  of  Africa  and  the  world  in
campaigning for a peaceful resolution to  the  crisis  in  the  Middle  East
after the further occupation  of  Palestinian  land  and  territory  by  the
Israeli government and the increased Israeli state  aggression  against  the
people of Palestine.
We condemned, as a nation, in the  strongest  possible  terms  the  violence
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces, which  includes  extrajudicial
killings; the  wanton  destruction  of  infrastructure;  the  compulsion  of
people to live under very restrictive conditions, including curfews;  and  a
refusal by the Israeli military force  to  allow  people  access  to  health
care, food and water under very difficult circumstances.  We  condemned  all
attacks on civilians, both Israeli and  Palestinian,  including  attacks  by
suicide bombers. We call for a cessation of hostilities to end  the  attacks
from all sides.

I do not think anybody in this House should get  up  and  say  that  suicide
bombings are justified, that the loss  of  life  of  Israeli  people,  as  a
result of suicide bombings, is correct. Yet,  at  the  same  time,  we  must
ponder and reflect, as the president of the United States did two days  ago,
when he said that what we are dealing with in the Middle East  calls  for  a
different approach, a total reform in the  social,  economic  and  political
conditions that face the people of Palestine.
Unless we address the social and economic conditions,  people  will  not  in
desperation and out of a loss of dignity  commit  acts  in  which  they  use
their limbs and their lives in order to commit atrocities  such  as  suicide
bombings.

That is the context which we must understand. So whilst we condemn then,  we
must be conscious of the fact that there are conditions which give  rise  to
this kind of desperation, which we condemn as a nation.

The actions of the Israeli government constitute a  grave  threat  to  peace
and security everywhere in this world. As  Martin  Luther  King  once  said:
``Injustice anywhere in the world is a threat to justice everywhere.''  This
action, in the context of the continued denial to the Palestinian people  of
the right to national self-determination, is an affront to  the  dignity  of
humanity.

Dignity is a condition such that even  where  the  oppressor  oppresses  the
oppressed, the oppressor shares something with the oppressed,  and  that  is
dignity. By liberating the oppressed, the oppressor himself  or  herself  is
freed. This is really  the  context  in  which  we  see  Israelis  occupying
Palestine. As in South Africa,  when  the  oppressors  liberated  the  black
masses in this country here, they  too  were  liberated;  by  affirming  the
dignity of those  who  were  racially  oppressed  they  too  affirmed  their
dignity as human beings. It is this universal connotation and  quality  that
we would like to reaffirm in this debate, be it the dignity of the  Israelis
or the dignity of the Palestinians.

We  call  on  the  government  of  Israel,  under  the   circumstances,   to
immediately and unconditionally implement United  Nations  Security  Council
Resolutions 1402 and 1403  and  to  accept  that  President  Arafat  is  the
legitimate representative of the people of  Palestine  as  an  indispensable
factor in the peace process. We cannot, as Mr Durr has suggested,  say  that
there will not be unity in Zimbabwe if there  is  a  Mugabe.  Similarly,  we
cannot say that unless Arafat is off of the scene,  there  cannot  be  peace
negotiations in Israel.

The United States, in particular, should use its influence  to  promote  the
implementation of the UN Security Council  resolutions  in  the  peace  plan
adopted by the Arab states at their recent meeting in  Lebanon.  The  United
States has a very important and critical role  to  play.  This  year  alone,
more than $2,1 billion was given in military aid to Israel, and  we  believe
these are conditions or resources that are being abused by the  Israelis  to
perpetrate aggression on innocent, and in most  cases,  unarmed  Palestinian
victims.

South Africans from all sectors of society have come out in support  of  the
struggle of the people of Palestine and of peace in  the  Middle  East.  All
peace-loving and democratically minded South Africans,  regardless  of  race
or religion, should take this uncompromising stance on peace in  the  Middle
East.  We  should  prohibit  the  use  of  military  weapons   against   the
defenceless and unarmed civilian population.

South Africa have first-hand experience of this. As a  people,  we  know  of
the pain and trauma of massive loss of life due to  political  conflict.  We
know what it is each day to bury  people  who  are  involved  in  continuing
conflict. We know that as a nation the best solution is for  the  contending
parties to get around the table to find a solution.

It is important that the United Nations delegation be allowed  a  access  to
Jenin to investigate and determine the nature and extent of  the  deaths  of
civilians and the destruction  of  infrastructure  caused  by  the  military
incursions of the Israeli army. We are aware of the visual  material,  which
has been  circulated  throughout  the  world  in  the  print  media  and  on
television, of the massive destruction that has taken place.  We  are  aware
of conflicting reports by the Israeli military force as  to  the  number  of
people who were killed. And, certainly, to prohibit  such  an  investigation
from taking place would not be in  the  interests  of  justice  and  in  the
interests of peace. We can never wish that anybody should be prevented  from
investigating a situation, in which, ostensibly, there  is  gross  injustice
and a gross violation of human rights.
Every day we pray for peace for both  the  Palestinians  and  the  Israelis,
and, together, that prayer should be for the nation, for the people and  for
the contending parties in Israel and Palestine. However,  the  reality  that
we see on television and virtually every day is  one  of  death.  We  see  a
little child carrying a stone and trying to fling it  at  a  tank.  This  is
disproportionate; a little child showing a  spirit  of  resistance  to  this
occupation. That clearly depicts the reality that we see in Israel.

It is important that the Israeli government now seriously considers  efforts
in order to arrive at a peaceful negotiation, and that it does  not  dictate
the terms under which  it  would  want  to  negotiate  with  the  contending
parties to the dispute.  We  sincerely  support  the  establishment  of  the
independent state of Palestine and we also support, at the  same  time,  the
independence of the state  of  Israel  with  secure  borders,  as  has  been
proposed by the Saudi government and as  has  been  supported  by  the  Arab
states at their meeting that was held in Lebanon.
We take this position because we believe that in as much as  the  people  of
Israel are entitled to their self-determination, so too are  the  people  of
Palestine entitled to their self-determination and peaceful coexistence.

With this in mind, we propose that we support the initiative  by  the  Saudi
crown prince in terms of the decision that  has  been  taken,  and  that  we
support all efforts in finding a specific resolution to the problem.  We  do
believe that the starting point would really be compliance with  the  United
Nations  resolutions.  These  have  been  disregarded  and  discarded   with
impunity by Israel. Unless and  until  they  recognise  the  authority,  the
validity and their undertaking  to  international  law,  then  there  is  no
chance of  peace  in  sight.  We  do  believe,  however,  that  the  various
countries, the various democracies, should get together and  really  seek  a
peaceful solution to the Middle East, otherwise it  could  rip  the  country
apart and create instability throughout the world. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, there is much in what the hon member has said  with
which I am in agreement. I think it would probably surprise him ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Sorry,  hon  member,
can you put on both your microphones so that the sound can be better.

Ms C BOTHA: Thank you, Chair. I was remarking that  much  of  what  the  hon
member has just said the DA is in complete agreement with.  I  think  if  we
tended to listen carefully to each other, we would be surprised  that  there
are many issues on which we do not differ at all.

I am nevertheless grateful for the opportunity to  articulate  our  approach
in the DA to the Middle East conflict. Our party  support  cuts  across  the
religious divides. Amongst our members are many ardent  Christians,  Muslims
and Jews. All have an emotional and historical attachment  to  that  ancient
land. We also have, as hon members know, a variety of faiths represented  in
our leadership structures.

This reality informs our approach to policy, but it does not  form  it.  Our
position is premised on considerations which are as  defensible  within  the
party as outside. It speaks with  one  voice  to  Gentile,  Jew  and  Muslim
alike.

However, I am mildly bemused by the selection of this forum to hold such  an
emotive debate on an  international  question,  dedicated  as  the  National
Council of Provinces is to bringing a  provincial  perspective  to  national
issues. Yet the same House has neglected to debate  Angola,  Swaziland,  the
Sudan, the DRC and many more African issues which have considerably more  of
an immediate impact on South Africans  than  the  relatively  remote  Middle
East - ek is nie klaar nie [I have not finished yet] - where  our  leverage,
if it exists at all, is negligible. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, on a  point  of  order:  I  must
raise this point here. I said previously that I  attributed  good  faith  to
the hon member when she made a misleading statement. This debate here  takes
place on the basis of an agreement by all political parties,  including  the
political party from which the hon member comes. And,  again,  the  Whip  Mr
Lawrence Lever is here and would confirm that the title of this debate,  the
date of this debate and time of this debate were mutually  agreed  upon.  To
suggest now that this debate has been manipulated or planned in such  a  way
that it does not take into account the views of other political parties,  is
an utter misrepresentation of the fact. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana)  Order!  Order!  Ms
Kgoali, order! The fact that we as parties agreed  to  follow  a  particular
procedure cannot preclude a member from freedom of speech. I do not see  how
I will stop the hon member from speaking. I  agree  with  you,  Chief  Whip,
that that is the case, but can that stop a member from expressing  her  view
in a  House  in  which  freedom  of  expression  is  allowed?  That  is  the
difficulty which I have. I do not deny  that  as  the  Whip  you  took  that
position, but can that in itself stop a member from expressing her view?

Hon member, please continue.

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I was hoping that the hon Chief Whip  would  listen
as carefully to my speech as I did to his; then he  would  remember  that  I
said right at  the  outset  that  I  am  grateful  for  the  opportunity  to
articulate our approach.

Our President  has  repeatedly  called  for  African  solutions  to  African
questions, and quiet diplomacy when dealing with our neighbours. Yet on  the
Middle East we seem intent  on  voluble  insistence,  even  by  our  Cabinet
Ministers in their public and private  capacities,  on  importing  into  the
South African body politic and into our community life, the  very  political
divisions that have caused such tragedy in Israel and Palestine. The  Middle
East conflict has much broader implications than  the  unuttered  rationale,
perhaps for this particular  debate,  which  frequently  yet  simplistically
posits that what needs to be overcome in  the  Middle  East  is  merely  the
Israeli version of apartheid.

Only a truly balanced approach,  devoid  of  political  self-interest,  will
lend any credence or contribute positively to  the  role  South  Africa  may
play on the Middle Eastern stage. For the DA the crux of a lasting  solution
is this ... [Interjections.] There is a DA, on whose  behalf  I  can  speak.
[Interjections.] As a member of the DP, speaking also on behalf of  the  DA,
the crux of a lasting solution  is  this:  the  mutual  recognition  of  the
rights of Palestinians and Israelis each to have sovereign, independent  and
secure states. To the DA and the DP this is fundamental.

We believe that  resolution  of  the  present  Middle  Eastern  conflict  is
possible.  Despite  the  years  of  the  historical  divide,  the   cruelty,
injustice, lost lives, lost opportunities and children  forever  silenced  -
the enduring image of Mohammed Al-Dura comes  to  mind,  overlaid  with  the
latest suicide bombing  of  young  Israelis  playing  an  innocent  game  of
snooker  -  despite  these  seemingly  endless  additions   to   layers   of
accumulated injustice, we believe the future can be secured.

For negotiations to take place, Israelis and Palestinians must both have  an
absolute commitment to peace and the negotiating process in order  to  reach
an agreement acceptable to both.  After  centuries  of  conflict,  years  of
negotiation, now tied up in several momentous international agreements,  the
successful unravelling of the ancient Gordian knot along  the  Jordan  River
is in sight. But for negotiations to succeed,  the  desire  for  peace  must
surpass the lure of ideology or of transitory gains.

The DA is committed to the core issues of security for Israel and  statehood
and human rights for Palestine. We  completely  underwrite  the  Palestinian
desire for  statehood  and  human  rights,  and  we  accept  Israel's  real,
legitimate and rational concern over security. In addition, we  consider  it
vital that the countries of the region  must  enter  into  an  accord,  both
individually and collectively, which honours the agreement the  Palestinians
and the Israelis have reached about their future, and will  reach.  This  is
what makes the Saudi Arabian initiative, which calls on the  recognition  of
the territorial integrity and security  of  both  Israel  and  the  proposed
state of Palestine by countries other than  the  protagonists,  cardinal  to
the success of any solution.

We agree with Deputy Minister Pahad in  his  speech  to  the  South  African
Zionist Conference earlier this year, in which he said:


  The prerequisite for a prosperous state of Israel, living within  defined
  and secure borders, and in peace with its neighbours, is  an  independent
  Palestinian state committed to its own peace and prosperity, side by side
  with its neighbour Israel.

We also support a negotiated solution,  we  support  implementation  of  the
Mitchell Plan recommendations, we reject terrorism, we condemn  the  use  of
excessive force, the blockading  of  the  Palestinian  authority  ...  [Time

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, we have contemplated this motion before  the  House
and subjected it to the test of what it can do for South Africa and  how  it
conforms to our international obligations. We were elected by our people  to
serve their best interests, to coin a phrase, ``to  achieve  a  better  life
for all''. We need to be careful  that  positions  we  take  abroad  do  not
backfire on us and create divisions in our society which  otherwise  do  not
exist, and frustrate our attempts to develop our  own  people  and  our  own
region.

We are a country with a limited ability to project itself and  to  influence
others effectively far beyond Southern Africa. Zimbabwe  is  an  example  of
that. We need to work within the international community, like  the  UN.  If
we are honest with  ourselves,  the  great  contribution  we  have  made  in
conflict resolution was  in  the  field  of  reconciliation  and  democratic
government at home. This more than anything edified our nation and  gave  us
influence.

What was achieved here was achieved by South Africans working  together  for
peace, with the minimum of outside interference. It  was  accompanied  by  a
suspension of violence and strong reconciliatory statements and  actions  by
its leaders and endorsed by elections and referenda. Our  achievements,  and
hence  our  strongest  card,  have  been   reconciliation,   democracy   and
constitutional government based upon the rule of law.

Few of these conditions apply in the Middle East at this time.  The  players
in the Middle East have internationalised their problems and look to  others
for solutions. Our ability to influence the situation in  the  Middle  East,
though limited, is dependent upon the parties  to  the  conflict  respecting
our views and seeing our role, if any, as  impartial,  objective  and  based
upon the facts of the situation.

Our credibility and influence only carry weight and can only be  effectively
brought to bear if we are seen to be impartial and if we were to be  invited
by the parties concerned to play a role. To  maintain  our  credibility,  we
need to refrain from making partial judgments and  using  emotive  language.
Is the motion before the House impartial? Clearly not. It goes much  further
even than UN Resolutions 1402 and 1403. This resolution is not even in  line
with the position of  most  of  our  developed  industrialised  democracies,
whose help we require to develop our country and our continent,  or  of  our
main trading partners.

Israel is a friendly nation in good standing with us. She  has  huge  power,
influence and potential to assist in Africa in a variety of  ways.  She  can
also be a deadly enemy. Israel  has  the  right  to  live  in  peace  within
recognised, sustainable frontiers, whilst not being subjected  to  terrorist
attacks, and has the right to self-defence. I am glad  that  the  hon  Chief
Whip of the ANC confirmed that. Does this motion recognise that? The  answer
is no. My party therefore opposes the motion before the House.

They talk of consultation. I was never consulted on this motion. A draft  of
the motion was dropped on my desk by Mr Sulliman. I took one look at line  1
of the resolution and I said that I opposed it. Never  was  I  consulted  by
the Chief Whip of my provincial delegation, and I  do  not  consider  myself
bound by the provincial delegation on this matter. Where is  the  provincial
content in this motion? This should be dealt with as a section  75  measure;
it is a national measure. [Interjections.]

Were I able to move an amendment, which I am not,  I  would  have  moved  an
amendment to the effect that this Council urges all parties  to  the  Middle
Eastern conflict to cease hostilities  and  to  seek  reconciliation  and  a
negotiated peace that respects the rights of all in  the  region,  and  that
the Council affirms South Africa's willingness to help with this process  in
an impartial way, if called upon to do so. We wish all  the  people  of  the
Middle East peace and goodwill. [Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Chair, hon Minister and hon  members,  not  so  long  ago  the
world was faced with one of the worst forms of abuse of  human  rights  when
numbers of innocent people, unarmed civilians and young children lost  their
lives. It was a moment when one could actually question  whether  the  value
of human life had any meaning at all. I am talking  about  the  genocide  in
Rwanda. The whole world was shocked at the revelations that came  from  that
incident. That was an incident in our  history  never  to  be  forgotten  or
repeated, but, disappointedly so, it seems that this  is  recurring,  slowly
re-emerging in a different format in a different society.

Today we are once  again  faced  by  another  incident  where  one  actually
wonders where our civilisations are going to, and what the world  is  coming
to. Today the world is faced with yet another situation in which  the  value
of human lives and  respect  for  human  rights  are  questionable,  if  not
undermined.

We are talking about the situation in Palestine. The Israeli  occupation  of
Palestine is undermining the human rights of  the  Palestinian  people.  The
occupation is an act  perpetrated  against  defenceless  civilians,  unarmed
men, women and children - an act for which no grievance or  cause  can  ever
be justification. It is an act that  must  be  condemned.  It  is  indeed  a
direct attack on humanity. It is an attack on our very own core  beliefs  in
human rights: in equality, in freedom and in self-determination.

As a nation we have been there. We struggled for  our  own  liberation,  our
own freedom and self-determination. Therefore,  who  better  can  understand
what the Palestinians  are  going  through,  but  us  and  others  who  have
suffered similar situations? Our history has placed  us  in  a  position  to
understand   the    wrongfulness    of    oppression,    intimidation    and
marginalisation.

Our history as a nation has placed  us  in  a  position  to  understand  the
desperation of the Palestinian people. It has placed us  in  a  position  in
which we can understand why young women and men are  prepared  to  sacrifice
their lives. While we can understand this, our history has  also  taught  us
that violence can  never  bring  a  lasting  solution.  Our  experience  has
demonstrated that peace can be achieved through dialogue and negotiations.

We, as a nation, therefore, have an obligation to bring  this  awareness  to
the consciousness of the new emerging global morality, a renaissance in  the
hearts and minds of people for a  better  world  where  peace,  respect  for
human rights and justice prevail. The Israeli occupation  of  Palestine  has
resulted in the death of hundreds of Palestinians and some  Israeli  people.
Many of those who died were young men and children.

The Israeli government's total disregard for international human rights  law
has  resulted  in  extreme  discrimination  against  Palestinians.  It   has
resulted in  severe  restrictions  on  labour,  employment  and  freedom  of
movement, as well as punishment  for  those  whose  views  challenge  social
convention. This list of human rights abuses is endless.

Noting  the  escalation  of  violence  in  Palestine  and  Israel,  and   in
acknowledgement  of  a  need  for  the  international  community  to  better
understand  the  conflict,  a  multiparty  delegation  of  members  of   our
Parliament was sent to embark on a fact-finding  mission  to  Palestine  and
Israel last year.

The document they compiled confirmed what has been known for a long time  by
people who closely follow the situation in the Middle  East,  and  who  have
been concerned about the human rights abuses caused  by  Israeli  aggression
in that region. The findings included denial of health care, which  resulted
in the continued ill health of the people caused by deliberate and  targeted
environmental  degradation;  the  psychological  trauma;  and  the  physical
trauma and fear experienced  by  the  children  as  a  result  of  sustained
violence, harassment, humiliation,  intimidation  and  instability.  We  are
talking about children who had to witness the killings  of  family  members,
friends and neighbours.

The incarceration of the Palestinian leader clearly aggravated  the  crisis.
It was a direct attack on the heart and soul of the Palestinian people.

These are some of the findings, but not all. According to the  report  these
actions seem to be directed at all  facets  of  Palestinian  existence,  and
seem to represent a total onslaught against Palestinian  people.  These  are
clear,  concise  and  direct  examples  of  the  disdain  with   which   the
Palestinian people are being treated. They are indeed gruesome acts  of  the
gravest forms of abuse of the human rights of the Palestinian people,  which
have to be condemned.

An end to these miseries has to be addressed vigorously in order  to  embark
on a path of peace, instead of violence. Violence, as we have  witnessed  in
our own history, has  never  been  a  solution,  but  instead  a  source  of
anarchy. This is an appeal for the sake of mankind, and for the  sake  of  a
better world where humanity rises to eliminate subjugation of the weak.

To conclude, I wish to call on all political parties to condemn  the  abuses
of the human rights of the Palestinian people  and  to  support  a  peaceful
solution where reason prevails, and for both the Palestinians  and  Israelis
to take a leaf from the lessons of our history. They should  not  allow  the
mistakes of the past to determine their actions, but they  should  focus  on
the prospects of  a  peaceful  future  through  negotiations  and  dialogue.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  If  the  hon
member had bothered to look up she would have seen that  it  was  not  Madam
Chair sitting here. [Laughter.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, my neighbour behind me is disturbing me,  and  I
would like to have your protection. [Interjections.]

The IFP has considered the issue of the Palestine-Israel conflict. It  is  a
conflict which is very complicated. We find it very difficult to say who  is
wrong and who is right, but the most important  thing  for  us  is  to  seek
peace in the Middle East. The fundamental truth in the Middle East  question
goes deeper than the general public knows. As a result, it is not  going  to
stop tomorrow, but it will continue for centuries to come.  The  tragedy  in
that process is the loss of human life.

One question  that  one  always  asks  is:  What  is  it  that  propels  the
Palestinians to fight for their cause in  such  a  unique  manner,  by,  for
instance, using suicidal bomb attacks? What is it that  moves  them  to  use
that kind of action? On the other hand, we hear that  the  Palestinians  are
labelled as terrorists. Then one asks the question: What is a terrorist?

However, the prudent approach right now would be to support  the  call  made
by Chairman  Arafat  to  his  Palestinian  militia  to  stop  forthwith  the
suicidal bomb attacks on Israel. But at the same time the  state  of  Israel
needs to react with restraint where  Palestinian  civilians  are  concerned.
The suicidal bomb attack on Israel yesterday claimed the lives of more  than
15 people. That was indeed tragic.

The historical and peaceful resolution of the Middle East question,  in  our
view, needs a multilateral approach, which would include the superpowers  of
the world, for instance the USA,  Britain,  Russia,  France,  and  then,  of
course, Palestine, the Arab states, and why not South Africa, so  that  they
can sit down and negotiate, rather than having one  superpower  involved  in
that kind of a conflict. They can then  begin  to  develop  a  way  forward,
which will establish lasting peace.

It is imperative that the Oslo  accord  of  1993  should  be  revisited  and
repursued  by  the  the  superpowers.  This  accord,  among  other   things,
advocated the resolution of the whole situation in the Middle East within  a
climate of peaceful co-existence of the two  countries.  It  also  suggested
the division of Jerusalem as a capital. The prudence of such  an  action  is
debatable,  but,  all  in  all,  the  Oslo  accord  advocates  peaceful  co-
existence.

We believe the the Saudi peace plan  also  has  to  be  revisited,  because,
among other things,  it  advocated  the  development  of  lasting  peace  in
Israel,  wherein  Palestine  and  Israel  would  be  equally  recognised  as
independent states, rather than one being subservient to  the  other.  [Time

Dr E A CONROY: Agb Voorsitter en kollegas,  elke  saak  het  gewoonlik  twee
kante en dit word selde gevind dat een van die twee strydende partye  in  'n
konflik heeltemal skuldig en die teenparty heeltemal onskuldig is.

Feit van die saak is dat dít wat vandag in die Midde-Ooste  aan  die  gebeur
is, sy oorsprong reeds eeue gelede het toe die nasate  van  Ismail  aan  die
een kant, en dié van Isak aan die ander kant, mekaar nie  kon  vind  nie  en
die familietwis van tyd tot tyd op bloedige botsings uitgeloop  het.  Daarom
sal die probleem nie weggaan as buitestaanders eenvoudig een van die  partye
as die skuldige uitwys en veroordeel nie.

Dit is daarom soveel meer te waardeer dat daar groeperinge  is  wat,  hoewel
nie direk en fisiek by die konflik betrokke nie,  maar  tog  as  gevolg  van
eeue-oue  bloed-  en  familiebande  hulself  emosioneel  as  deel  van   die
uitgerekte stryd beskou, die morele moed het om hierdie saak  op  'n  totaal
onpartydige wyse te benader en met  'n  aanvaarbare  oplossing  vorendag  te
kom.
Ek verwys hier na die voorstelle van kroonprins Abdullah van  Saoedi-Arabië,
wat nou ook amptelik die voorstel van die Arab League  geword  het.  Ons  is
van mening dat dié voorstelle die basis  vir  verdere  onderhandelings  moet
wees, wat in die eerste plek alle Arabiese state, Irak en  Sirië  ingesluit,
inbind tot erkenning van Israel se bestaansreg en, in die tweede  plek,  dit
as 'n quid pro quo stel dat Israel onttrek uit  alle  gebiede  wat  ná  1967
beset is.

Die Nuwe NP verskil egter op een belangrike punt met dié plan, naamlik  dat,
indien dit aanvaar word, die Palestyne nie kan aandring  op  die  sogenaamde
``right of return'' nie. Israel se reg op 'n eie Joodse staat  ooreenkomstig
Prins Abdullah se voorstelle sal  nooit  'n  werklikheid  kan  word  as  die
vlugtelinge die reg het om terug te keer nie.

Ons standpunt  is  dat  geweld  nie  'n  oplossing  vir  die  Midde-Oosterse
probleem is nie. Ons  glo  verder  dat  samesprekings  so  spoedig  moontlik
hervat moet word en, om dit te verseker, dat 'n internasionale arbiter  moet
toesien dat die  Mitchellverslag  wat  deur  beide  mnre  Arafat  en  Sharon
aanvaar is, onmiddellik in werking gestel word. In dié  verslag  word  onder
meer voorgestel dat  alle  geweld  gestaak  word,  dat  die  Palestyne  alle
terreurdade met swaar strawwe aan die oortreders aan bande  lê,  dat  Israel
die uitbreiding van alle vestigingsgebiede staak en  dat  die  sluiting  van
toegangsroetes tot die Palestynse gebiede opgehef word.

Ons het deurgaans gesê dat as Suid-Afrika 'n rol in die oplossing wil  speel
- en beide partye het reeds by meer as een geleentheid  aangedui  dat  hulle
graag ons ervaring in  dié  opsig  sal  wil  deel  -  ons  rol  die  van  'n
onpartydige buitestaander moet wees en ons moet dus  nie  emosioneel  daarby
betrokke raak nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson and colleagues, every issue usually has  two
sides and one seldom finds  that  one  of  the  two  warring  parties  in  a
conflict is entirely guilty and the other party entirely innocent.

The fact of the matter is that that which is happening in  the  Middle  East
today already had its origins centuries ago when the descendants of  Ishmael
on the one hand, and those of  Isaac  on  the  other,  could  not  find  one
another and the family feud resulted in bloody clashes from  time  to  time.
Therefore the problem will not go away  if  outsiders  simply  identify  and
judge one of the parties as being guilty.

It is therefore to be appreciated even more that there are groupings  which,
although they are not directly and  physically  involved  in  the  conflict,
still consider themselves emotionally part of  the  drawn-out  battle  as  a
result of centuries-old blood and family ties, and have  the  moral  courage
to approach this matter in a totally impartial manner and come  up  with  an
acceptable solution.

Here I am referring to the proposals by Crown  Prince  Abdullah  from  Saudi
Arabia, which have now officially become the proposal of  the  Arab  League.
We are of the opinion that these proposals should be the basis  for  further
negotiations, which in the first place bind  all  Arabic  states,  including
Iraq and Syria, to the recognition of Israel's right to  existence  and,  in
the second place, state as a quid pro quo  that  Israel  withdraw  from  all
areas occupied after 1967.

However, the New NP differs with this plan on one  important  point,  namely
that, if it is accepted, the Palestinians cannot  insist  on  the  so-called
right of return. Israel's right to an own Jewish state in  terms  of  Prince
Abdullah's proposals will never become a reality if the  refugees  have  the
right to return.

Our position is that violence is not a solution to the Middle East  problem.
We further  believe  that  discussions  should  be  resumed  as  quickly  as
possible and, to ensure this, that an international arbiter must see  to  it
that the Mitchell report which  was  accepted  by  both  Messrs  Arafat  and
Sharon be implemented immediately. It is proposed in  this  report,  amongst
other things, that all violence be suspended,  that  the  Palestinians  curb
all acts of terror by way of stringent punishments of  the  offenders,  that
Israel suspend the expansion of all settlement areas and  that  the  closure
of access routes to the Palestinian areas be suspended.

We have said throughout that if South Africa wants to play a  role  in  this
solution - and  both  parties  have  already  indicated  on  more  that  one
occasion that they would like to share our experience in this regard  -  our
role must be that of an impartial  outsider  and  we  should  therefore  not
become emotionally involved.]

We cannot condone the senseless attacks from either side. In  terms  of  the
global coalition against terrorism we cannot condone the  senseless  suicide
bombings like the one the day before yesterday in  which  16  Israelis  were
killed. Neither can we condone unacceptable acts on the Israeli  side  which
only serve to add fuel to the fire. The present Indian ambassador  to  South
Africa has mentioned on occasion that no  political  situation  can  justify
acts of terror and that violence is not a solution.

What we as the New NP would like to see is  that  this  House  condemns  any
form of violence by either of  the  two  parties,  including  the  senseless
killing and maiming of innocent civilians; that this House  firmly  supports
a return by both parties to the negotiating table; that this House calls  on
both  parties  to  immediately  implement  the  Mitchell  report  which  was
accepted by both the Israeli and Palestine authorities; and that this  House
supports negotiations on the basis of the Saudi-Arabian  and  Taba  proposal
which specifically refer to the position  of  Jewish  settlements,  the  so-
called right of return and the position of Jerusalem.

Mr R M NYAKANE: Madam Chair, what is really happening in  the  Middle  East,
especially between the Israelis and the Palestinians? Put  differently,  who
or what caused the conflict between the Israelis  and  the  Palestinians?  A
close scrutiny of the political dynamics  of  the  first  war  suggests  the
following: Britain had conducted a treacherous diplomacy in the Middle  East
when it was  engaged  in  the  war  with  Turkey.  It  approached  the  Arab
communities for help in its war with Turkey and promised in return to  grant
the Arabs an independent national state in Palestine.  Meanwhile,  in  1917,
Lord  Balfour,  the  British  Foreign  Secretary,  had  already  released  a
declaration that after the  war  with  Turkey,  Britain  would  support  the
establishment of  the  Jewish  national  state  in  Palestine.  Britain  had
therefore double-parked its political position and that led to a dilemma.

Britain could no longer smoke the pipe without coughing after  the  war  due
to pressure from the Jewish  and  Palestinian  interests.  She  consequently
passed the buck to the United Nations.

The United Nations therefore decided in 1947 to divide  Palestine  into  two
portions, the east and the west, without consulting the Palestinians.

Now we come to Sharon and Arafat. Ariel Sharon blames Arafat for  supporting
and funding the Hamas and Jihad terrorist organisations. He claims that  for
the past eight years he tried in vain to foster peace in  Palestine  through
Arafat. As a result Arafat has been declared a terrorist. On the other  hand
the US decided to abandon  cooling  down  Israel  and  declared  Arafat  the
centre of the problem. The latest world perception is that America  is  part
the Middle East problem.

Egyptian foreign Minister  Ahmed  Maher  failed  to  team  up  with  Arafat,
becoming another player causing more conflict because Arafat counted him  as
supporting the Arabs. Ahmed accused Arafat's Fata faction  of  being  linked
with the Hamas and Islamic Jihad and called on him to  disassociate  himself
from them. All eyes are today on Arafat.

Are President Bush and Sharon aware of Arafat's limited political  influence
within the Islamic communities in the  Palestine?  Mousa  Marzook,  a  Hamas
leader, ably put it as follows:


  Hamas is a political power and not a security threat only; Arafat is  the
  chairman but we shall not follow his orders; he wants to implement the US
  and Israel orders; we shall not accept that.

In conclusion, may I share with you the observations made by Time  magazine.
The argument goes that most Palestians now embrace suicide  bombing  as  the
only means at their disposal to resist  unremitting  occupation.  No  matter
what Arafat may say or do, Hamas remains a danger  to  everyone  engaged  in
the Middle East.  The  Hamas  and  its  military  wing,  embittered  by  the
American war in Afghanistan, are seriously considering adding US targets  in
Israel and the territories to the hit list. The US and Israel  have  to  sit
down and review their strategic approach. The Hamas and Jihad activists  are
a force to be reckoned with and cannot be ignored. They have to be  part  of
the peace negotiating process. [Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson,  South  Africans  are  familiar  with  political
labelling such as ``swart gevaar'' and  ``communist  plot''.  These  slogans
were a deliberate plot to divert us  from  key  issues  such  as  apartheid,
which the UN declared a crime against humanity. All  these  slogans  were  a
big bluff!

With regard to  the  Palestinian  issue  we  see  a  similar  strategy.  Any
criticism of Israel's policies is taken an expression of antisemitism.  With
this slogan the argument  against  Israeli  occupation  is  supposed  to  be
closed and sealed. Of course, we reject this attempt at censorship,  because
it dismisses the grounds for debate altogether.

No amount of suffering, be it of the Tutsis, the Kurds, the  Armenians,  the
Vietnamese,  the  Bosnians  or  the  Palestinians  many  confer  on  anybody
immunity from criticism. Moreover, and sadly so, no  amount  of  persecution
would seem  to  immunise  people  against  perpetrating  the  same  horrible
practices they suffered in the past. Remember the Holocaust that  was  faced
by the Jewish  community  during  World  War  II.  How  cruelly  has  Sharon
decimated families, shelter and possessions!

We  mourn  and  abhor  the  killing  of  people,  especially  the   innocent
Palestinian and the innocent Israeli people. No appeal to the incitement  or
supposed promises of some holy land declared by  one  God  can  condone  the
actions carried out by an  invading  and  occupying  army  -  or,  for  that
matter, the cold-blooded massacre of innocents ordered by  fanatic  warlords
in the name of resistance. Sharon may win this military and  one-sided  war,
but he has lost the hearts and  minds  of  many  people  everywhere  in  the
world. The USA and Britain have also threatened the lives of many  of  their
innocent citizens everywhere in the world.

No reference to a sacrosanct ``Greater  Israel''  can  camouflage  the  fact
that those settlements are armed colonies built on land  shamelessly  stolen
from the Palestinians and occupied by  Caucasian  Jews  from  all  over  the
world, especially from Eastern Europe.

There is no passage to peace via the annihilation  of  the  other,  just  as
there is no paradise  for  the  martyr.  The  late  Anwar  Sadat,  a  former
President of Egypt, once suggested that  once  the  Middle  East  issue  was
over, they would build a temple on Mount Sinai. This temple  would  only  be
open on Fridays for the Muslims, Saturdays for the Jews and Sundays for  the
Christians. That was his vision at the time.

We in  the  ANC  find  this  anti-Semitism  allegation  utterly  deplorable,
especially coming from Jewish intellectuals  who  so  often  constitute  the
reasonable, rational and creative backbone of Western societies. Why  should
we be subjected to such special pleading, or look the other way when  it  is
Israel committing crimes? If Israel has to have weapons of mass  destruction
for its defence, all other nations should also have  the  same  weapons  for
the same reason. That is logical. But we stand for  peace  and  respect  for
all human life, in whom God has given us creative people from  whom  all  of
us can benefit by their inventions. We in the Free State  have  had  comrade
Bram Fischer, a Jew, who has given such immeasurable gifts to all of us.

Ms C BOTHA: An Afrikaner Jew!

Rev M CHABAKU: A viable state cannot be built  on  the  expulsion  of  other
people who have as much claim to the territory as  one  has.  Might  is  not
right. In the long run, his immoral and shortsighted policies  will  further
weaken Israel's legitimacy as a state.

Recently, MPs have had the opportunity of visiting the territories  for  the
first time. And yes, I am afraid,  they  reasonably  describe  Palestine  as
resembling Bantustans - for too  often  their  visit  presented  to  them  a
duplication of the ghettos and controlled camps of misery we  once  knew  in
South Africa.

If Sharon were a general in the  old  South  African  army,  he  would  have
bombed Soweto and the Vaal Triangle  out  of  existence.  We  remember  that
those townships were infested with what Israel describes as ``terrorists''.

We have come through two world wars in the past century, yet, barely a  year
into the new century, we stand on the brink  of  a  third.  People  of  both
Palestinian and Jewish descent reside all over the world.  There  are  about
4,5 million Palestinians living in exile and I do not know how  many  Jewish
people living outside of Israel. The third generation of Palestinians  after
1948 - that is the year of the birth of Israel - still think they come  from
Palestine, even though they were born and raised in another  country  or  in
the concentration camps in Israel. These Palestinians  call  themselves  the
``Palestinians returned''.

Members of the NCOP must see that although  there  is  a  massacre  and  the
destruction  of  the  Palestinian  landscape,  there  is  still  an   active
commitment to Palestine, no matter what it takes. Are we  willing  to  allow
the creation of another Hiroshima? How will this one end? Because it is  not
ending, it has just started.

Nelson Mandela has consistently said: ``There are good men and women in  all
communities.'' These simple words contain the wisdom of  the  ages.  Therein
lies the answer to our present dilemma. The challenge is to find  compassion
in our hearts, across barriers, and to build  a  third  way  which  sends  a
clear message: We do not want our children to die  wherever  they  may  find
themselves, in Afghanistan, in Burundi, in the United States, in  Kenya,  in
Palestine, in the DRC or in Israel. We need to  strip  away  the  ideologies
and see the common pain of families when their loved ones die. Let  us  turn
enemies into friends.

I am reminded of a statement made by a prominent local  journalist,  Zubeida
Jaffer, who said:


  When we brought peace to our apartheid-ravaged  nation,  we  developed  a
  third way. But this third way required pride to be swallowed, egos to  be
  scaled down, uncomfortable compromises to be made. The hard challenge  is
  for all those in the Middle East to settle their differences and for  all
  the world to help do that  or  else  be  engulfed  by  an  uncontrollable
  conflagration. Building peace now requires greater courage than  piloting
  fighter planes and training soldiers.

It is important to note the contribution of the  Nonaligned  Movement,  also
widely known as NAM, on Palestine, which met at  the  ministerial  level  in
Durban on 27 April 2002. The  NAM  members  of  the  Security  Council  were
invited and participated in the meeting.

The Ministers welcomed UN Security Council Resolution 1405 of  2002  on  the
dire humanitarian situation of the Palestinian civilian population  and  the
fact-finding team dispatched by the Secretary-General.  The  Ministers  also
welcomed the proposals of the Secretary-General of  the  United  Nations  on
the establishment  of  a  robust  and  credible  multinational  force  under
Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The  Ministers  called  on
the members of the Security Council to quickly consider the proposal of  the
Secretary-General and to take the necessary measures in this regard.

The Ministers agreed that the  presence  of  such  a  force  could  make  an
important, positive contribution towards the rapid achievement  of  a  final
settlement between the two parties. The Ministers called  for  an  immediate
end to violence, killing and destruction and the speedy resumption of  peace
negotiations on  a  final  settlement,  one  which  would  end  the  Israeli
occupation,  including  the  colonial   settlements,   and   lead   to   the
establishment of a Palestinian state with  Jerusalem  as  its  capital.  The
Ministers took positive note of the vision affirmed by the Security  Council
in Resolution 1397 of 2002.

With these few remarks, I am sure that we shall overcome. We shall  overcome
and God will overcome and the devil will be crushed down. Amen. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon  members,  I  think
if there was  any  doubt  why  we  should  be  discussing  this  issue,  the
contribution by many hon members has given the answer.  Clearly,  we  cannot
remain silent when a catastrophe is beginning  to  unfold  before  our  very
eyes. Events in the Middle  East  now  are  going  beyond  the  Palestinian-
Israeli conflict and are beginning to engulf the whole region. Indeed,  they
are a threat to world peace and security. Because of that, it  is  incumbent
upon us to discuss this. Otherwise it would be the silence  of  the  guilty.
We, whether we are in the provincial structures or  national  structures  or
outside of government structures, must make our voices heard. Failure to  do
so would ensure that future generations will not forgive us.

There has been some suggestion that we are not treating this matter  with  a
balanced, impartial approach and  there  is  some  political  expediency  at
play. This statement is made without any indication of  what  is  meant.  In
fact, it is again in the context  of  seeking.  We  are  trying  to  find  a
peaceful solution, as most of the speakers have  said.  It  is  not  just  a
statement. Then there is no indication of what we are being  accused  of  in
being partial and politically motivated and, indeed, not balanced.

Let me quite clearly state that we cannot be impartial,  as  other  speakers
have said, to the issue of the latest suicide bombs, just as  we  cannot  be
impartial to all suicide bombings that have been carried out in  the  Middle
East. We cannot be impartial about that, and we have to condemn  it  without
any reservations, because, as has been said, no acts such as  these  can  be
justified by any cause. And, indeed, it is  my  contention  that  the  act's
timing, at the very time when Prime Minister Sharon  was  meeting  President
Bush, in fact leads the strategy of those who are  trying  to  reflect  that
the Palestinians are not partners for peace  and,  indeed,  are  really  the
terrorists.

I  want  to  believe  that  we  condemn  this  suicide  bomb,  like  others,
specifically because it diverts attention from where the  real  violence  is
being  perpetrated  and  therefore  puts  the  Palestinians  in  the   dock.
Therefore  the  suicide  bombers  do  not  serve  the   interests   of   the
Palestinians as a whole. I think that it would be good if the House, as  was
mentioned by one speaker, took note of the fact that  President  Arafat  has
consistently condemned terrorist acts for the reasons I have given,  against
civilians, of course. But here again, after the latest act of  terrorism  he
called on his security forces - or what is left of  them,  because  a  large
part of them has been destroyed by the Israeli offensive -  to  take  action
within their limited framework to stop any further  attempts  at  terrorism.
But, I must repeat, his capacity has been decimated by the  Israeli  defence
force actions.

He said once again, in his televised address last night, that he would  join
the fight against terrorism whether it was  against  Palestinians,  Israelis
or the United States. It is that element that we must begin to  give  credit
to. The very fact that 14  senior  Palestinian  leaders  who  have  publicly
supported  the  suicide  acts  have  now  been  arrested  is,  I  think,   a
manifestation of  the  commitment  of  the  Palestinian  leader  to  find  a
peaceful solution.

In this context we cannot be impartial; we  must  condemn  and  support  the
attacks against suicide bombing. But, at the same  time,  we  cannot  remain
impartial to Prime Minister Sharon's statement as he was leaving the  United
States, and I quote:


  He who rises to kill us, we will pre-empt and kill him first.
This belligerent statement is  followed  by  the  Israeli  security  council
decision last night to give a green  light  to  the  defence  force  to  act
against the Palestinians. I want to believe that this is  a  dangerous  move
away from international law  in  terms  of  humanitarian  law.  Indeed,  any
action by the Israeli defence force  in  the  same  manner  they  have  been
acting in the last few months is tantamount to saying that in that place  we
cannot find a peaceful solution, and it is only  a  military  solution  that
can succeed. We cannot be impartial to that.

I think that we are quite clear in our minds that terrorism is  the  symptom
and not the disease. We cannot ignore the reality that  the  peace  dividend
which brought hope to so many Palestinians and Israelis after  the  historic
Oslo accord in 1993 has not materialised.  Nobody  can  challenge  the  fact
that since 1993 Israeli settlement in Palestinian  territory  has  continued
unabated and relentless. The freedom of movement  of  Palestinians,  as  has
been  indicated,  has  been  systematically  curtailed  and  Israeli  troops
continue to impose collective punishment on the Palestinians.

I want to agree with everybody who says - and we cannot be  impartial  about
that - that fundamental to the resolution of the conflict  is  the  creation
of an independent Palestinian state. We must  accept  the  reality  that  no
level  of  violence  from  the  Israeli  state  will  stop  that  from   the
Palestinian side unless this objective is achieved.

Colin Powell, the Secretary of State of the United States, a few  weeks  ago
said, and I quote:


  Prime Minister Sharon has to take a hard look at  his  policies  and  see
  whether they will work. If you declare war on the Palestinians and  think
  you can solve the problem by seeing how many Palestinians can be  killed,
  I do not know that that leads us anywhere.

So, clearly, the Israeli logic  of  seeking  out  and  destroying  so-called
terrorist bases fails to understand that the Palestinians are ready  to  die
because it is no longer possible for them to live as a dispossessed  people.
Therefore we are partial in saying that no amount of  violence  against  the
Palestinians will stop their struggle for their own  homeland  and  national
state.

I want to believe, as other speakers have said, that  the  surest  guarantee
for an Israeli state within secure borders is to have  a  Palestinian  state
which is side by side with the Israeli state. Together they  have  to  build
economies and relations across the borders and bring about peace,  which  is
in the interests of both the Israelis and the Palestinians.

Honestly, we cannot be impartial to the level  of  violence  that  has  been
taking place in the Middle East in the last few months. And, as I have  said
before, we cannot pretend that this does not affect us.  Indeed,  these  are
heavy casualties on both sides, nearly 2 000 Palestinians and  400  Israelis
killed, and a single death is one death too  many.  Under  no  circumstances
can somebody ask why we discuss this issue and not another issue. This is  a
fundamentally dangerous situation we are experiencing.

As speakers have said,  nowhere  else  in  many  years  have  we  seen  such
systematic  destruction  of  Palestinian  infrastructure  -  not  only   the
security and government infrastructure, but medical  facilities,  water  and
sanitation facilities, roads, the  airport,  the  agricultural  sector.  The
scale of the destruction  is  very  difficult  to  compare  with  any  other
situation that one has experienced for a long time.

Indeed, I want to say that we have all been subjected to the reports of  the
massacres  in  Jenin  and  other  occupied  territories.  It  is   therefore
important that as we sit in this House, and the other House,  we  should  be
able to raise our voices  against  the  terrorism  perpetrated  by  elements
among the Palestinians as well as the  state  action  that  is  being  taken
against the Palestinian people.

Regarding the United Nations Secretary-General - this is  where  I  disagree
with the hon member Durr - the motion is nowhere near the  Security  Council
motions unanimously accepted by all, including the United States, or by  the
emergency session of the General Assembly two days ago, which was  voted  in
by 74 in favour with four against. The resolutions are quite clear.  As  the
Secretary-General said:


  ... self-defence is not a blank cheque ... responding to  terrorism  does
  not in any way free Israel from its obligations under international  law,
  nor does it justify creating  a  human  rights  and  humanitarian  crisis
  within the occupied Palestinian territory.

He went on to say:


  There is an urgent need to comply with all  provisions  of  international
  law, particularly those that ban indiscriminate and disproportionate  use
  of force, as well as the humiliating treatment of a civilian population.

It is not we who are saying this because of political expedience; it is  the
Secretary-General of the United Nations. I want to believe that he  reflects
the view of all those in  Israel,  Palestine  and  internationally  who  are
committed to finding a peaceful solution and ending the  cycle  of  violence
that is leading to the loss of  so  many  lives.  In  fact,  the  Secretary-
General says that the report of his envoys in the  Middle  East,  especially
in Jenin and the occupied territories, has deeply disturbed him. He went  on
to say: ``The situation is horrific. The  destruction  is  massive  and  the
impact on the civilian population is devastating.''

The Human Rights Commission has said  that  there  have  been  severe  human
rights violations. The NAM meeting and the EU have also reflected  on  this.
So we cannot be impartial to the scale and the level of  brutality  that  is
being perpetrated in occupied Palestinian territories.  Just  as  we  cannot
justify suicide bombings against Israeli civilians, no end can  justify  the
means that the Israeli army is using in the Palestinian territories.

The siege of Arafat has thankfully ended, but again, nowhere  in  the  world
have we witnessed a situation like that - that a leader  proclaimed  by  his
own people as their leader is kept under siege. Now we are told that  he  is
not partner to negotiations and they must find another partner. The  message
that we must send is quite  clear.  Arafat  is  the  only  leader  that  can
deliver long-lasting peace, and nobody has the right to determine who  leads
the Palestinian people.

Let me also say that the events around  the  Church  of  the  Nativity  must
shock all of us, irrespective from what denomination we come, because it  is
unacceptable that that took place. But it is also a matter of fact that  not
only churches and mosques, but also  other  religious  institutions  in  the
occupied territory have experienced severe damage because of the actions  of
the Israeli army. This is unacceptable in any civilised world.

Therefore, we cannot be impartial about  this.  Let  me  also  say  that  we
cannot be impartial about the fact that the Israeli government  has  refused
to implement any of the Security Council resolutions. Resolutions 242,  328,
1402, 1403 and 1405, were, as I said, unanimously accepted. The  refusal  by
the Israeli government to implement these resolutions, with clear  impunity,
means one is undermining the very multilateral structures that one needs  to
strengthen to deal with terrorism, underdevelopment and poverty.

I do not think we can remain impartial to the reality  that  Israel  is  the
only country in the world that can treat Security Council  resolutions  with
impunity, as it has done. This means  that,  as  South  Africa  and  as  the
international community, and in order to  ensure  that  the  United  Nations
institutions do not collapse into disrepute, we will have to argue  for  the
implementation of these resolutions.

The very fact that Israel could prevent  the  fact-finding  mission  of  the
Secretary-General of the United Nations from going to Jenin  to  investigate
reports of massacres  is  again  something  about  which  we  cannot  remain
impartial. Where else  in  the  world  is  this  possible?  Even  the  South
Africans, for a long time, were  unable  to  prevent  missions  from  abroad
investigating what was happening here. Until we  have  a  mission  going  to
Jenin and other territories,  the  suspicions  will  remain  that  something
happened there that the authorities want to hide. No, we cannot  allow  that
to continue, because if we want long-lasting peace we  must  let  the  truth
come out. We must ensure that we create the conditions for this to be  dealt
with. The reasons for not allowing the Security Council  mission  are  quite
unacceptable by any standards.

But what must we do, as  the  NCOP,  the  National  Assembly,  and,  indeed,
society as a whole? I think we must start working to ensure that both  sides
build a shared vision of peace and future relations in a time of  peace.  It
is quite obvious: one  makes  peace  with  one's  enemies,  not  with  one's
friends, and peace makes enemies into friends.

Now, this is something that the present Israeli  government,  led  by  Prime
Minister Sharon, must accept. He must accept that one will never solve  that
problem through violence and military means, and  that  the  only  guarantee
for stability and security is peace. We must send out  a  message  to  Prime
Minister Sharon that he must start  negotiations  immediately,  without  any
preconditions. I mean, he should realise the basic truth that  preconditions
place in the hands of a man of violence the right  to  veto  any  discussion
and engagement on an agenda  for  peace.  Indeed,  it  is  our  belief  that
preconditions give those on both sides who do not want  to  see  a  peaceful
solution, an opportunity to sabotage any movement towards genuine peace.

And then, as I said, we must, of course, take into consideration - and  this
is what came out in the spear initiative that was  undertaken  by  President
Mbeki with the peace forces on both sides - the fears and  concerns  of  the
other side and engage seriously with that.

Raising our concern about what the present Israeli government  is  doing  is
not, as one of my colleagues said, anti-Semitic. Indeed, we  find  it  quite
unacceptable that a movement that grew up  fighting  anti-Semitism,  because
we believed that anti-Semitism was a smokescreen for other forms of  racism,
can now be accused of being anti-Semitic. It is  a  fundamental  element  of
our policy to fight all forms of discrimination, and  anti-Semitism  is  the
worst form of discrimination.

But if we do not begin to find a solution to the Middle  East  issue,  those
right-wing elements in Europe and the United States who have begun  to  show
the ugly heads of anti-Semitism and racism will gain  strength  and  exploit
that situation for their own wrong purposes. So, it is quite important  that
we move quite decisively to strengthen the peace camps on both sides.

I want to say what President Arafat has referred to on many occasions,  also
after he signed  with  Rabin,  the  then  Israeli  Prime  Minister  who  was
unfortunately and sadly assassinated by  another  right-wing  lunatic,  that
what is in the interests of Israelis and Palestinians is to seek  the  peace
of the brave, which Rabin and Arafat initiated. I want to believe that  that
is the message we put  forward,  totally  impartially,  because  we  support
those that are committed to peace. We will reject and oppose all  those  who
are committed to war. And that I do not think hon members can ask us  to  be
impartial about. I  do  not  understand  how  one  can  be  impartial  in  a
situation like that.

Let me therefore say - and I am repeating this - that  we  will  support  in
Israel and in Palestine all those who pursue  an  unconditional  agenda  for
peace. This is not a narrow commitment to any  political  party  or  to  any
liberation movement. It is a  commitment  of  support  to  all  elements  of
Israeli and Palestinian society who believe that peace can be won back  from
the ruins and tragedy of the present events. We want to  believe  that  this
is the hope and vision for both Israelis and Palestinians.

So,  before  I  end,  let  me  say  we  are  continuing  dialogue  with  the
Palestinian  national  authority,  with  the  Israeli  authority,  with  the
Israeli peace camp, on the basis that unless one has a legitimate  right  of
the Palestinian people to a national Palestinian state, one  will  never  be
able to guarantee the security of the Israelis. On this issue there  can  be
no debate, and there can be no questions about it. At the same  time,  as  I
said, we will always condemn acts of terrorism  because,  as  I  started  by
saying and as Arafat has just stated, every time  there  is  progress,  some
form or act of terrorism that takes place turns the clock back and puts  the
Palestinians in the seat of the accused. I think  this  is  unnecessary  and
indeed makes it difficult to find a peaceful solution.

In conclusion, let me quote  a  former  attorney-general  of  the  state  of
Israel, who said, during the prime ministership of the late Rabin:


  The Zionist dream's realisation and the Jewish  people's  national  birth
  were not achieved because of tanks, planes or other aggressive means. The
  state of Israel was born because the Zionist movement  realised  that  it
  must find a solution to Jewish persecution and  because  the  enlightened
  world recognised the need for that solution. However, the Six-Day War was
  forced upon us, but, the War's seventh day, which began on June 12, 1967,
  has continued to this day. It is the product of our choice.  The  Six-Day
  War's seventh day has transformed us from a moral society,  sure  of  the
  justice of Israel's creation,  into  a  society  that  oppresses  another
  people, preventing it from realising its legitimate national aspirations.

I think that quote captures for me the understanding of many Israeli  people
that their future is interlinked with the future of the Palestinian  people.
It is also the voice of those within Israel and outside who  come  from  the
Jewish faith, who are raising their  voice  to  say  they  will  not  remain
silent while the Israeli government,  in  the  name  of  the  Jewish  people
generally, is carrying out the acts that it is carrying out.  I  think  that
it is a good sign that there are people within Israel and the  Jewish  faith
generally who are standing up to voice  this  message  of  hope  and  future
prosperity.

In Israel many movements have arisen. There is  the  For  Mothers  Movement.
There are conscientious objectors among soldiers. The  former  Israeli  head
of security has said that one will never be  able  to  solve  the  situation
militarily, and  with  the  conscientious  objectors,  who  are  growing  in
number, saying they need to move out of Palestine and  allow  a  Palestinian
state to exist, which will determine the existence of an Israeli state.

The Arab initiative and the Mitchell initiative are all openings to  find  a
solution. Anybody who is genuinely committed  and  who  has  read  the  Arab
resolution from the last Arab summit, will realise that this  is  a  genuine
commitment to finding a long-lasting solution, which takes into account  the
needs of the Israeli society to have a state within secure borders.  It  and
the  Mitchell  tenet  plan  give  the  Israelis  an  excellent  opportunity,
especially those that are in power, to  find  a  solution  that  is  in  the
interests of the Israelis themselves.

I want to believe that we must mobilise the international community  through
the United Nations, through NAM, and through interactions  with  the  United
States and the European Union, to try to ensure that the  many  peace  plans
that have been put forward are implemented. Again, one cannot  be  impartial
about this reality.

Let me then conclude by saying that we must leave this House more  convinced
that the future of all of us depends on getting  a  peaceful  resolution  to
the Middle East crisis, and it is not in support of one another, but  it  is
in support of justice, equality and human dignity. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I thank Deputy Minister Pahad,  who  has
played a very supportive role in two important debates. The  NCOP  has  made
him work in the House this term.

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                  Vote No 33 - Water Affairs and Forestry.

The MINISTER OF  WATER  AFFAIRS  AND  FORESTRY:  Chairperson,  hon  members,
sanibonani,  dumelang,  avuxeni,  goeiedag,  molweni,  salaam  aleikum   and
shalom, we are  a  Government  of  delivery  and  achievement,  and  we  are
building a better life for all our people in every part  of  this  wonderful
country. The key challenge for grass-roots delivery  is  to  make  democracy
work at local level.

So whilst I will report on the remarkable achievements of our Government  in
water service and sanitation and the management of our forests, I  start  by
talking about the delivery and management of democracy at  local  government
level. This is most relevant to this august Council of  the  provinces,  and
if we do not understand the importance, I am not going to  be  able  to  get
the House to understand what my  department  is  proposing  in  this  coming
year.

The experience of the last millennium is that many great civilisations  grew
from strong local structures, and water has often  been  the  focus  of  the
first attempts at local organisation. The Dutch  invented  local  government
in the 12th century to manage the water that  threatened  their  lives.  The
British established their local government system to bring  to  an  end  the
plague and pestilence of their 18th century cities.

The ANC has always promoted participation of communities  in  running  their
lives.  The  whole  structure  of  local  government  -  the   approach   to
participatory  planning,  accounting  to  residents  by  councillors  -   is
designed to re-enforce this. But it is one thing to design a system and,  as
we well know, another to implement one.

We are entering another important phase in the  process  of  building  local
democracy. We have established our municipalities; now we have to make  sure
they  do  their  job  of  providing  services  to  our  people  efficiently,
effectively and affordably. We have to ensure that they play their  role  in
creating jobs and opportunities. That is the challenge of this phase of  our
struggle.

It is against  this  background  that  I  want  to  start  by  reporting  an
important success achieved by my department this past year.  Each  year  the
implementation of our water services programme has relied more and  more  on
local government. In the last financial year  we  warned  that  because  new
local governments had only just been established, it would be  difficult  to
spend the available budget and comply fully with the conditions  imposed  by
Treasury through the Division of Revenue  Act,  for  full  local  government
involvement and ownership of this process.

In July of last year, I issued quite a warning  to  my  director-general  to
say that we had better find ways of stepping up that  expenditure  flow.  It
was a difficult year to keep  delivery  going.  The  exemplary  work  of  my
department and support from all concerned - Salga, provincial MECs, and  the
mayors and councillors -  made  it  possible  for  us  to  spend  and  spend
effectively over R1,1  billion  of  the  budget,  the  largest  amount  ever
allocated for water services - that is one part of  my  budget  since  1994.
With this expenditure we managed to provide a  basic  water  supply  to  1,2
million people and improved sanitation for  50  000  households  during  the
year. Approximately 280 000 people were given health and hygiene  education.
Temporary job opportunities were created for nigh  on  100  000  people  and
training for well over 11 000.

What does this mean for our provinces? In KwaZulu-Natal there was a  special
effort in view of the cholera outbreak. An amount of R304 million was  spent
to serve over 367 000 people  with  basic  water  supply  and  over  23  000
households  with  sanitation.  In  Limpopo  province,  also  threatened   by
cholera, which fortunately was contained due to the dedicated and hard  work
of all structures, a total amount of R234 million was spent to serve  almost
500 000 people with basic water and 5 600 households with sanitation.

In the Eastern Cape an amount of R170 million was spent to serve almost  130
000 people with basic water  supply  and  718  households  with  sanitation.
About R132 million was spent to  serve  117  000  people  with  basic  water
supply and 364 households with sanitation in Mpumalanga. In North West,  the
Chief Whip's province, about R91 million was spent to serve  nearly  50  000
people with basic water and nearly 9 000 households with sanitation.
In the Free State, the province of the Reverend who was so eloquent  on  the
Middle East issue, R22 million was spent to allow  over  27  000  people  to
receive clean water and provide sanitation to 343 households.  The  Northern
Cape programme focused on sanitation, and I can  report  that  over  10  000
households have improved sanitation facilities in  addition  to  40  000  in
that province receiving clean water.

This is a department of our Government that  is  delivering,  and  there  is
more. In terms of agreements with the Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government, my department  focuses  less  on  the  urban  provinces  of  the
Western Cape and Gauteng, but as monitor and  co-ordinator  of  Government's
sanitation programme, I can tell hon members that  in  those  two  provinces
over 113 000 families benefited from improved sanitation.  We  can  multiply
those households by eight, or by 10 even, to get an idea of  the  number  of
people we are reaching.

That was largely as a result of  investment  associated  with  our  national
housing programme. It demonstrates a point - people are concerned with  what
Government does, not what individual departments do. We celebrate  the  fact
that nationwide the total delivery of sanitation last year was  to  356  000
units, that serves 2,5 million people. We can now deduct  2,5  million  from
that awful figure  of  18  million  in  last  year's  backlog  in  terms  of
sanitation. Two and a half million in one year is  not  bad  going  for  the
Government, or any government in this world. That was  the  combined  result
of the programme of our Department of Housing, the Department of  Provincial
and Local Government and my proud Department of Water Affairs and Forestry.

Our delivery is being  recognised.  I  am  very  proud  that  this  year  my
department was awarded a very prestigious prize, the Energy Globe Award  for
sustainable development in water. We received it  in  Austria  as  the  best
programme out of over 1 300 selected from 98 countries. [Applause.]

In the coming year I am pleased to announce that the exchequer budget,  that
is R3,5 billion this year, including poverty and infrastructure  allocations
previously made, together with donor funding, will see  the  expenditure  on
our community water and sanitation rise to  an  all-time  record  of  R1,215
billion.

That is our Government that is determined to deal with the backlog  left  to
us by the apartheid nightmare. This includes a contribution of  almost  R200
million from the international donor community who understand that  we  know
how to look after their funds, and that we can put that money to work  in  a
transparent and accountable way. That is why my department is  receiving  so
much from the European Union and other countries.

My department, consequently, has been able to budget  an  amount  of  nearly
R900 million for water supply and almost R160 million  for  sanitation,  the
highest level ever. This is double last year's amount for sanitation and  as
much as we spent on sanitation in the past five years.

We are getting to grips with the sanitation backlog. Those allocations  will
enable a million people or more to receive clean  basic  water  and  toilets
this coming year, toilets for approximately 150  000  households,  including
the real beginnings - and I pledge this to members - of the  eradication  of
the bucket system. [Applause.] This year, 10  800  households  in  the  Free
State - I draw the hon Reverend's attention to that - 5 800 in the  Northern
Cape, 3 300 in Mpumalanga, the North West and the Western Cape and 2 080  in
the Eastern Cape will be replaced. Hallelujah!

We are already on track to making the  constitutional  right  of  access  to
basic water supply a  reality.  With  this  year's  budget  we  provide  the
springboard and this, strategically, is so important. Those  were  important
statistics. But what last year did more than that tremendous  sturp  forward
in the  year,  was  create  the  real  springboard  for  us  to  attack  the
sanitation backlog.

We are taking the lead in ensuring that sanitation  is  given  its  rightful
priority, not just in our country, but in Africa and the world.  I  will  be
very  proud  if  I  am  remembered  as  ``the  Minister   of   Sanitation''.
[Laughter.]

We are organising, together with the United Nations, an  Africa-San  working
meeting ahead of the World Summit to decide here in  South  Africa  how  the
world will decide to improve  sanitation  in  Africa  and  globally.  Amanzi
ayimpilo, water is life and sanitation is dignity. [Applause.]

Because sanitation is a matter of health and dignity,  as  well  as  of  the
protection of the environment, we  have  launched  what  we  call  the  Wash
Campaign - water, sanitation, health. ``Izandla  ziya  gezana''  -  the  one
hand washes the other - emphasises the  importance  of  health  and  hygiene
education to beat the scourge of cholera and similar diseases.

We will continue to work to increase the funds  available  for  delivery  of
better sanitation through community-based projects that create jobs  at  the
same time. ``Izandla ziya gezana'' emphasises partnership and  co-operation,
as the one hand must co-operate with the other to beat cholera.

Sanitation is not a dirty word; it means dignity for people. At the  current
rate of progress, this Government will wipe out the deficit of 7 million  of
our people still without clean water. We will wipe it out by the year  2008.
And the 15,5 million to 16 million people now  without  adequate  sanitation
will have adequate sanitation by the year 2010. This is a  mighty  programme
of delivery.

I must always emphasise, however, that the provision of  infrastructure  for
water and sanitation is only a first step. It  is  only  worthwhile  putting
the pipes in the ground and building the toilets  if  they  are  effectively
operated, maintained and sustained. This brings me to the point,  again,  of
local government.

In terms of our Constitution, the provision of water and sanitation  is  the
responsibility of local government. In terms of our  Constitution,  national
and provincial government must help  and  support  them  and  monitor  their
performance, intervening only where necessary.

The approach of our department  has,  since  1997,  been  to  address  water
services  as  a  local  government  support   programme.   Now,   with   the
establishment of our  local  governments  in  December  2000  and  with  the
passage of this year's Division  of  Revenue  Act,  we  have  established  a
programme for the transfer of the responsibility. Within  three  years,  334
schemes operated by the department, inherited  from  the  former  homelands,
are to be refurbished and transferred to the local government  concerned  or
to service providers nominated by them, which may include the water  boards,
the family of regional public water service providers.

The budget allocated to my department, which I have shown  hon  members  how
well we are putting it to use, will  be  progressively  transferred,  either
through   the   equitable   share   of   revenue   for   local    government
responsibilities, or through a consolidated municipal  infrastructure  grant
which my department will help to administer.

I am pleased about this, but  I  am  going  to  watch  this  very  carefully
because we have done our work, we have shown how we can spend the money  and
what we are doing. We have to ensure, with hon members' help,  that  we  can
transfer, that local government is going to be able to take over  the  baton
and carry on the job. Otherwise we will fail.

As part of the transfer process a review is  under  way  of  all  the  water
schemes - those built since 1994 with department funds,  as  well  as  those
inherited from the homelands, in order  to  ascertain  their  sustainability
and identify requirements for refurbishment. But  we  must  understand  that
keeping schemes working depends, as I have said, on  local  government  that
works, and, with it, communities that are committed to  managing  their  own
lives. We need to create incentives for local government and communities  to
organise and manage their service provision effectively. We can do it.

This is a wonderful country; we have the people  who  know  how  to  do  it.
Therefore I am very pleased to welcome to this House today,  sitting  up  in
the gallery, Mrs Busi Mzila of the Nhlungwane village community of  KwaZulu-
Natal, which last year won the Water Institute of  Southern  Africa's  Award
for Excellence in Rural Water Supply.  [Applause.]  Malibongwe,  malibongwe,
malibongwe! [Viva!] I am pleased that she has an escort from  the  community
with her. She and  the  community  did  not  wait  for  a  distant  district
municipality to come and establish and run  their  water  scheme.  With  the
help  of  an  NGO,  Mvula  Trust,  they  bought  a  scheme  which  they  run
themselves,  using  contributions  from  village  members.   I   must   also
congratulate Mvula Trust  on  its  approach  to  promoting  community  self-
sufficiency and the Water Institute of Southern Africa on instituting  these
sustainability awards.

There  are  three  important  lessons  here.  The  first  one  is  that  our
development should not have to wait  for  Government,  as  the  people  have
shown. We can all start initiatives. Secondly, local government  must  learn
that it will not do everything  by  itself,  and  if  a  community  has  the
ability to organise, local government  should  support  their  efforts.  The
third lesson is the question of local government having the right to  choose
who its service provider for water will be. Now, although it is  continually
stated  by  certain  critics  of  this  Government  that  this  is   favours
privatisation, let me make it clear that this is not the case.

The Water Services Act and municipal legislation  allows  municipalities  to
choose private service providers,  but  that  does  not  mean  that  private
service provision is a preferred option. What  is  most  important  is  that
local  government  chooses  a  service  provider  which  can  do   the   job
effectively.

The conclusion is simple. Those who oppose privatisation must  get  off  the
sidelines  and  put  their  shoulders  to  the  wheel.  In  the  spirit   of
vukuzenzele [stand up and do it for yourself.] my message is: Work  with  us
to help make the public and community sector a viable alternative.

The issues of sustainability and choice of competent service provider  bring
me to another important achievement - the introduction of free basic  water.
By the end of last year over 66% of those people  served  with  water  by  a
municipality were already benefiting from the  introduction  of  free  basic
water.

This year, on 1 July - a significant date, the new financial year for  local
government - I expect 24 more local authorities to  begin  implementing  the
policy. This will ensure that another 3 million people will  receive  access
to free basic water, bringing the combined total to 27 million  people,  76%
of  those  who  have  access   to   infrastructure.   The   outstanding   70
municipalities which still have  to  introduce  free  basic  water  will  be
targeted with support to ensure that we make further progress.

With all the change that has occurred at local government level, as well  as
in the financial arrangements  nationally,  I  must  acknowledge  that  many
questions  have  arisen  about  the   policy   regarding   water   services,
specifically with regard to local government and more  broadly.  How  should
local government organise itself and  be  supported  to  ensure  that  water
services are provided reliably, affordably  and  efficiently?  Members  will
have to help local government to understand and answer this question.

I have initiated a policy review process to bring our 1994  White  Paper  on
water supply and sanitation up to  date.  A  discussion  document  is  being
distributed to all interested parties  throughout  the  country  to  address
these questions. How should  financial  transfers  to  local  government  be
made? Can we require the equitable share to be used to  provide  free  basic
services? How will the water and sanitation services  be  supported  by  the
new municipal infrastructure grant?  What  consideration  should  guide  the
choice of service providers? What is the role of the  water  boards?  Should
there be a national regulator? These are just some  of  the  questions  that
will be addressed over the next few months.

Let  me  turn  to  another  sector,  vital  to  the  lives  of  our  people,
particularly the poorest and particularly in the  rural  areas,  namely  the
forestry sector. Here, too, there are important  issues  of  governance,  in
this  case  affecting  provincial  government  agencies,   communities   and
traditional authorities, which must be addressed. We  are  well  aware  that
there are limited formal job opportunities in our rural areas, and  that  it
is hard just to subsist. We know 80% of the energy needs of the  rural  poor
are met by using firewood. Even where  there  is  electricity,  many  cannot
afford to use it for cooking, and have to rely on firewood, which the  women
usually collect.

We know, too,  that  our  natural  forests  are  places  of  great  cultural
importance. I therefore take very seriously my  role  as  custodian  of  the
nation's  forests.  A  great  deal  of  attention  has  been  given  to  the
restructuring of commercial forests over the past few  years,  and  we  have
made good progress in achieving our objective of handing over to  commercial
management  their  operations  that,  by  their  nature,  are  best  run  as
businesses. This has greatly benefited many rural communities.

Commercial forestry plantations  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through
creating  jobs  and  business  opportunities,  and  generating  income.  The
private  companies  concerned  have  recognised  that  they  cannot  operate
effectively  in  rural  areas  without   good   relationships   with   their
neighbouring communities. As a  result,  they  have  engaged  in  innovative
partnerships  through  which  rural   communities,   including   traditional
authorities, have gained access to the benefits of commercial forestry.

The  restructuring  process  has  also  facilitated  black  empowerment  and
allowed the previously disadvantaged a share in the  ownership  and  control
of the forestry companies. All private sector bidders  had  to  allocate  at
least 10% of shares to black empowerment interests, and up to 9% to  workers
via  the  employee  stock  ownership  option  plan.  The  approach   towards
empowerment has varied in different  bids.  In  some  the  companies  sought
communities as partners while in others they have  joined  with  established
black-owned companies.

Singisi Forest Products showed how a  large  private  sector  company  could
form a joint venture with community groups, to take over and manage  70  000
hectares of commercial forests in the Eastern Cape  and  KwaZulu-Natal.  The
Siyaqhubeka consortium was the first case  where  a  black  company,  rather
than a community trust, took shares  in  a  forestry  company,  running  the
KwaZulu-Natal plantations previously managed by Safcol. These are  important
initiatives and will be joined by the Komatiland  bid,  in  which  a  wholly
black-owned company, Zama Resources, is negotiating as the preferred  bidder
for the largest block of forests in Mpumalanga and Limpopo.

I must also tell members that our initiatives to restructure our  management
of indigenous forests, to ensure that they are preserved and  used  for  the
benefit of local communities, are bearing fruit.  I  need  to  tell  members
about the many ways in which our forests are being  developed  and  used  to
create livelihoods for our people. How many know,  for  instance,  that  the
Mineworkers Development Agency, has developed a programme, with the  support
of my department, to use the marula trees in the north of the country  as  a
source of valuable essential oils? Two thousand four hundred women  from  42
villages are involved in this  project,  supplementing  their  income  by  a
small but useful R275 a month each.

In the Eastern  Cape,  a  private  company,  Storms  River  Adventures,  has
initiated a unique tree canopy  tourism  project,  which  allows  people  to
visit Knysna's unique yellowwood forests.  This  has  created  a  number  of
useful new jobs.

Our timber harvesting programme in the Knysna Tsitsikamma  forest  has  just
been recommended for certification by the international  Forest  Stewardship
Council.

Then there is a new product to absorb spilt oil on roads or  in  rivers.  It
is made from the leaves of the Casuarina pine,  collected,  with  assistance
from my department, from the coastal forests of KwaZulu-Natal and  processed
to make a useful contribution both to local employment and to  our  exports.
Similarly, in the same province, more than 500 people have been employed  to
collect resin byproducts from pine trees.

In the Free State, we have a community-based  nursery  in  Botshabelo  which
has had great success is selling tree seedlings for use in mine  reclamation
in a joint venture with the local mining companies.

All of of these examples help, I hope, to illustrate that  our  forests  and
trees are truly a national resource  and  one  that  can  be  and  is  being
protected and used for the benefit of our people.

One  of  the  developments  under  construction  will  be  the  transfer  of
indigenous forests currently  under  my  department's  management  to  South
African  National  Parks.  If  agreement  can   be   reached   between   the
conservation agencies at national and provincial levels, I  would  be  happy
to delegate the management of these forests, if  it  would  result  in  more
efficient management of a function that  is  currently  broken  up  among  a
number of different departments and agencies.

I expect similar developments in my department's unique  Working  for  Water
programme. This programme  aims  to  eradicate  invasive  alien  plants,  to
protect biodiversity, to improve land use and to reduce the amount of  water
used by these plants. In the present year, Working  for  Water  has  cleared
over 227 000 hectares, done follow-up work on 285 000 hectares, and  created
short-term employment for over 17 000 people, at a cost of R331 million.

I come back to my  starting  point.  For  all  of  these  activities  to  be
successful, we need sound  local  management.  If  our  communities  are  to
prosper, we have to build the capacity of local government to support  them.
We  have  to  ensure  that  the  capacities  and  energies  of   traditional
authorities and  other  community  structures  are  effectively  tapped  and
directed to achieving a better life for all.

Tomorrow, kusasa, in the National Assembly, I will  be  addressing  some  of
the broader challenges we face, the challenge of  planning  a  strategy  for
our national water  resources,  the  challenge  of  planning  to  deal  with
drought, the challenge posed by our engagement  with  Africa  through  Nepad
and the coming World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.

In all these initiatives, the key to success is to think globally,  but  act
locally, eradicate poverty and create a better life for all. I  am  mightily
proud that my department is playing its role in a government of delivery,  a
government of Vukuzenzele. [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Madam Chair, hon Minister, coming with good news to  all  the
South Africans, our Chief Whip, MECs present, permanent delegates ...

Motswana a re tlhapi solofela leraga metsi a tshele o  a  lebile.  [Preserve
the little that you have.]

At a world conference on water that took place in Holland, it was said  that
3% of the world's water was  clean,  which  implied  that  97%  was  already
polluted. That poses the challenge to protect the 3% from  pollution.  Clean
water is the gift of life. It can  overcome  poverty,  hunger  and  disease.
Therefore the domestic water supply is widely acknowledged as a key  element
in the fight against poverty and diseases. Adequate drinking water  supplies
are rightly seen, by our Government, as essential to the  wellbeing  of  all
South Africans.

Giving an adequate supply  of  fresh,  clean  water  to  a  poverty-stricken
community is like giving a blood transfusion to a dying person.  It  creates
a complete transformation in the community. Children become  more  eager  to
learn and young men and women are able to work harder to earn an income  and
to produce more food. It provides the  community  with  new  potential,  new
hope and new life.

However, water plays a far broader role than  in  the  traditional  domestic
activities of washing, cooking and drinking. In particular,  water  plays  a
crucial economic role; from watering livestock to  brewing  beer  in  rural,
urban and peri-urban environments. Water is a crucial  enabler  of  economic
activity, particularly for women and the poor.

The awareness of the centrality of water to people's wider  livelihoods  has
led to an increasing awareness of how  important  it  is  to  preserve  this
natural resource in the  interest  of  future  generations.  The  continuous
expansion of the number of people who need  water  and  sanitation  services
and growing industrial and agricultural activity, as  a  result  of  greater
economic opportunities in our country, has increased the demand  for  water.
Our water resources are threatened  not  only  by  this  rapidly  increasing
demand, but also by diminishing quality caused by pollution.

It is against this background that we have to view the department's  budget.
This budget has been shaped  by  the  need  to  balance  the  fight  against
poverty with the need to preserve our natural water resources. It  has  been
shaped by the need to balance  the  increasing  demand  for  water,  brought
about through the  increased  economic  and  agricultural  activity  of  our
people, with the need to preserve our natural water resources.

It is no mean feat for any department  of  water  affairs  anywhere  in  the
world to increase the number of people who have  access  to  clean  drinking
water and sanitation facilities by millions in the  short  space  of  a  few
years. This department has done it and for this we  applaud  them.  However,
there are still areas that have not yet been  reached  by  the  roll-out  of
free basic water and the provision of sanitation facilities.

Specifically in  the  North  West  province  I  interacted  with  the  local
municipality of Madibeng in Brits in connection  with  a  project  that  was
embarked upon four years ago, in 1998. This project has not  been  completed
yet, because after the first phase, no provision was  made  for  it  in  the
budget. I think it was an omission which must  be  rectified  urgently.  The
rural villages of Modderspruit, Bapong and Majakaneng  are  located  between
Rustenburg and Brits, which forms the southern gateway  to  the  North  West
province. They are at the intersection of the  N4  and  the  Sun  City  main
roads  and  fall  within  the  Madibeng   local   municipality's   area   of
jurisdiction.

These poor communities, comprising approximately 30 000 people, do not  have
access to an adequate supply of clean fresh water,  which  has  resulted  in
the deterioration of the environment, education and health  conditions.  The
urgency of our plea for support is augmented by fears  for  the  possibility
of cholera outbreaks in some of these villages. A water supply  project  for
the area was initiated during 1998, and the first phase of construction  was
completed by the middle of 2000. The Eastern  district  council  contributed
R1,5 million, and the province contributed R4,5 million for phase one.

This water supply project involves the design and  construction  of  a  bulk
water supply pipeline from Sonop to Modderspruit, as well as a pump  station
and a reservoir. In addition, the project involves  the  completion  of  the
water reticulation network for  the  respective  villages.  The  feasibility
study for the entire project has been  completed,  but  as  a  result  of  a
shortage of funds, only phase one of the project was implemented.

The remaining phases of this  project  link  up  closely  with  the  initial
phase. The success of the overall project depends on the  implementation  of
the remaining phases. Funding from  provincial  of  local  sources  for  the
remaining  phases  of  the  project  is  urgently  required  to  ensure  the
construction of the remainder of the reticulation, pipelines  and  the  pump
station, as well as the reservoir.

The  Bojanala  Platinum  district  municipality  needs  to  contribute  R5,2
million towards the project. The North West province needs to commit  itself
to contributing the sum of R8,9  million  for  phase  two  of  the  project.
Although the North West province's department of water affairs and  forestry
allocated R1 million for this rural water supply scheme, no further  funding
has been  approved  for  implementation  in  accordance  with  the  approved
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry business plan, amounting to  R13,15
million. Funding is required for the  implementation  of  the  remainder  of
this priority project in order to get water to the people.

Some of these problems relate to illegal water connections,  vandalising  of
street taps and leaky water  pipes.  Water,  as  we  all  know,  is  not  an
unlimited natural resource and we have to use it with great circumspection.

As patriotic South  Africans  we  all  have  the  responsibility  to  report
illegal water connections, the vandalising of street taps  and  leaky  water
pipes which have been installed at great  cost.  Illegal  water  connections
and leaky pipes can result in costly losses in the long term. Water that  is
being used through illegal  connections  or  is  lost  through  leaky  pipes
cannot be accounted for and billed. This  results  in  reduced  revenue  and
subsequently a reduction in the funds  available  for  new  water  projects.
Those who use water through  illegal  connections  and  those  who  fail  to
report it or fail to report leaky  pipes  are  unknowingly  depriving  other
poor communities of water.
The negative impact of unaccounted  water  through  vandalisation,  leakages
and illegal connections  becomes  even  more  apparent  if  one  takes  into
account the rapid rise in the cost of developing new water sources.

The cost of developing new water sources has risen because of a  combination
of various factors. The most accessible  water  resources,  in  other  words
those which need less money to develop, have largely  already  been  tapped.
Furthermore, I come to the water resources  that  are  less  accessible.  To
develop such water resources would require  more  money  and  more  advanced
technology. This technology is not readily ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, water is a source of life.  People,  vegetables,
animals and insects are all conceived in water. Some  grow  in  water.  When
they come into this world they are washed in water  or  licked  with  a  wet
tongue. Water is vital for a tiny acorn to become an oak. It is  often  used
to soften the hardest dirt and is able to crack concrete and rocks.  Through
water, lightning strikes with great power. As human beings, over 80% of  our
bodies are made up of water, hence water is very important.

The potential exists to establish job creation projects  to  utilise  sewage
outflow  for  vegetable  production   and   other   appropriate   irrigation
possibilities through the use of purified sewage  in  the  following  areas:
Welkom, Wesselsbron, Odendaalsrus and most towns in the Free State.  Through
the utilisation of purified sewage outflow which otherwise would  flow  back
into  the  natural  river  system,  the  potential  exists  to  cultivate  a
substantial volume of  normal  consumable  fresh  produce,  as  well  as  to
develop and expand the paprika industry.

A number of applications  exist  for  the  effective  combating  of  invader
plants for which manual labour can be used  and  is  well  suited.  Projects
have already been identified in the Reitz and Clarense districts  to  remove
alien plants from roads, railways and  along  riverbeds.  It  is  imperative
that these invaders be removed timeously and effectively in order  to  avoid
the spreading thereof to neighbouring farms.

A large potential to combat and remove alien invaders exists in the  eastern
Free State, especially the Thabo Mafutsuanyane area,  where  Scotch  thistle
and boetabessie [bush-tick berry] are primarily the largest  threat  at  the
moment.

There is an existing potential to do effective wetland  reclamation  through
the use of manual labour in the Thabo Mafutsuanyane area. Projects  of  this
nature will primarily be  aimed  at,  for  instance,  reclaiming  dongas  in
wetlands  and  the  curbing  of  soil  erosion  through   manually   erected
structures in wetland areas.

The removal of eucalyptus trees in Jacobsdal, in the south west  Free  State
area is an attempt to curb the unproductive  consumption  of  ground  water.
Projects of this nature can effectively be undertaken  through  the  use  of
manual labour and have the  potential  to  generate  secondary  value-adding
potential through the sale and further processing of the removed trees.

A potential seasonal job creation possibility also exists  for  the  removal
of hyacinth and other invader water plants in the above-mentioned  catchment
area. In this instance manual labour can be used to remove such plants  from
the banks of a number of dams and rivers.

Farmers' associations also have a direct interest in these  initiatives  and
can fruitfully be incorporated in such a scheme. This is  a  sample  of  the
ways in which poverty alleviation  can  be  achieved  through  water-related
projects. People are  gathered  to  share  what  their  visions  of  poverty
alleviation may be. They often bring about inventive and creative ideas  for
a better life for all. The need is now. The  action,  therefore,  should  be
now. [Applause.]

Mev  A  M  VERSFELD:  Voorsitter,  afgesien  van  die  enorme  probleem  van
viskwotas veral aan die Weskus, staar hierdie gebied 'n nóg groter  ramp  in
die gesig, naamlik water. Daar is drie  kategorieë  wat  vir  my  tot  groot
kommer strek  aan  die  Weskus.  Eerstens  is  daar  die  Ramsar-terrein  by
Langebaan. Dan is daar die Skuifraamdam en derdens  is  daar  die  Langebaan
Road akwafir. Ramsar val egter nie in die Minister se departement nie,  maar
sy departement se optredes het wel 'n direkte invloed op hierdie terrein.

Ek gaan nie lank vertoef by die Skuifraamdam nie, aangesien ek verlede  jaar
daaroor gepraat het. Aangesien dit  nou  'n  gegewe  blyk  te  wees  en  die
grootste rede vir hierdie besluit is om in die behoefte van  die  mense  van
die Kaapse Metropool te voldoen, wil die DA egter waarsku dat die  oplossing
nie in hierdie dam lê nie, en wel om die volgende redes.

Kaapstad gebruik tans 800 miljoen kubieke meter water per  jaar  en  nog  is
geen genoegsame poging aangewend om water te herwin soos  in  Windhoek  nie.
Die Skuifraamdam sal  120  miljoen  kubieke  meter  water  hou,  waarvan  90
miljoen kubieke meter geoormerk is vir Kaapstad. As daar 'n styging  van  5%
per jaar in die waterbehoefte aanvaar word, dan  sal  die  styging  in  drie
jaar, te wete die jaar 2005, 120 miljoen kubieke meter water wees.  Sou  die
dam dan eers voltooiing bereik  die  vroegste  in  2006,  het  die  behoefte
alreeds teen daardie tyd die dam verbygeskuif. Of ons  nou  daarvan  hou  of
nie, die enigste opsie is herwinning van  rioolwater  deur  middel  van  die
erkende tegniek wat in Windhoek suksesvol toegepas word.

My groot probleem met die dam is dat dit die  watergehalte  van  die  benede
Bergrivier  geweldig  gaan  beïnvloed.  Ek  het  dit  in  verlede  jaar   se
begrotingspos  duidelik  uiteengesit  en   huldig   nog   steeds   dieselfde
standpunt. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, apart from the enormous problem  of  fishing
quotas, especially on the West Coast, this area is facing  an  even  greater
disaster, namely water. There are three categories on the  West  Coast  that
give me great cause for  concern.  Firstly  there  is  the  Ramsar  site  at
Langebaan. Then there is the Skuifraam Dam and thirdly  the  Langebaan  Road
aquifir. Ramsar, however, does not fall within  the  Minister's  department,
but his department's actions do have a direct impact on this site.

I am not going to spend much time on the Skuifraam Dam, as I spoke about  it
last year. Seeing that it now appears to  be  a  given  and  that  the  most
important reason for this decision was to provide for  the  requirements  of
the people of the Cape Metropole, the DA wants to warn,  however,  that  the
solution does not lie in this dam, and in fact for the following reasons.

Cape Town at present uses 800 million cubic metres of water  per  annum  and
nevertheless no adequate efforts have been made to recycle  water,  like  in
Windhoek. The Skuifraam Dam will hold 120 million cubic metres of water,  of
which 90 million cubic metres have been earmarked for Cape  Town.  If  there
is an increase of 5% per  annum  in  the  water  requirement,  within  three
years, that means in the year 2005, the increase will be 120  million  cubic
metres of water. Should the dam only be completed at the earliest  in  2006,
the requirement would by then already have  exceeded  the  capacity  of  the
dam. Whether we like it or not, the only option is  recycling  sewage  water
by means of the acknowledged technique, as is being applied successfully  in
Windhoek.

My greatest problem with the dam is that it would have a  tremendous  effect
on the quality of the water of  the  lower  Berg  River.  I  explained  this
clearly in last year's Budget Vote and I am still of the same view.]

Minister Kasrils said in a press statement, and I quote:


  I must emphasise that it is Cape Town water users who will  have  to  pay
  for the dam.

Do the people of Cape Town know that, according to the World  Commission  on
Dams, dams normally cost more than 56% of the original cost  and  that  this
dam has a  large  number  of  hidden  costs?  So  it  is  vital  that  water
conservation programmes are stepped up.

Maar indien, soos dit nou blyk, die dam  'n  werklikheid  is,  is  daar  een
aanbeveling waaroor die DA sterk voel en dit  is  dat  daar  'n  pyplyn  van
Voëlvlei af na Withoogte  aangelê  word  en  nie  direk  in  die  Bergrivier
gestort word nie, want daar word bereken dat ten minste die helfte  van  die
water met die stortingsproses verlore  gaan  voordat  dit  Misverstand  weer
bereik. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[But if, as now appears to be the case, the dam is a reality, there  is  one
recommendation about which the  DA  feels  strongly,  and  that  is  that  a
pipeline should be installed from  Voëlvlei  to  Withoogte  and  that  water
should not  be  released  directly  into  the  Berg  River,  because  it  is
estimated that at least half of the water is lost again in  the  process  of
releasing it before it reaches Misverstand.]

That brings me to the Langebaan Road aquifer.  It  is  interesting  to  note
that the three most important propositions on which the  proposals  for  the
subtraction of underground water from the Langebaan Road aquifer  are  based
have proved to be wrong. I discussed this issue in detail during the  debate
on this Vote in 2000.

May I therefore inform the House about the well field in the Langebaan  Road
aquifer after one year of pumping, and  presently,  after  two  and  a  half
years. We have experienced the wettest winter in 40 years, yet the level  of
the Langebaan Road aquifer  is  still  dropping  and  it  appears  that  the
potential yield from this has been grossly overestimated. The loss of  water
and consequent expenses incurred by farmers subsequent to starting  to  pump
in  November  1999  must  be  ascribed  to  the  excessive  withdrawal.  The
department can surely expect a claim for compensation  for  losses  incurred
on several farms caused by the impact of this water abstraction scheme.  The
enormous cone which developed only 11 months after pumping  is  larger  than
predicted by the CSIR for five years of withdrawal.

If it continues increasing, it may start drawing  recharge  water  from  the
surrounding saline areas, with permanently disastrous results. I would  like
to refer the Minister to a well-point  about  eight  kilometres  from  where
pumping was done. Within two months, the well, which had  never  before  run
dry, was dry. Two kilometres further on  from  this  well,  two  excavations
dried up six months after pumping. A permanent well, another two  kilometres
further, dried up after 18 months and another well, 14 kilometres away,  was
now drying up after  30  months.  Remember,  all  this  happened  after  the
wettest winter in 40 years.

The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry decided  to  put  down  another
six boreholes. Unfortunately, these would only  be  supplying  present  data
and no information on baseline conditions.  New  monitoring  boreholes  that
had been sunk in 2001 were not monitored  before  November  2001,  and  they
were sunk in February. Although this permit has been granted on a  temporary
basis, there is no question about the extremely dangerous signs. A  drop  in
ground water resulting from pumping could  affect  the  whole  lagoon  marsh
around Geelbek, as well as the Ramsar site.

I would like to urge the Minister to support the need for studies to be  co-
ordinated and more research to be done. Another big concern is  the  quality
of the water in the Voëlvlei Dam, which is periodically choked  with  algae.
The Skuifraam Dam and the  extraction  of  ground  water  are  therefore  of
direct interest to the  industries,  people  and  environment  of  the  West
Coast.

Dr Shand of Ninam Shand was involved in the EIA studies  for  the  Skuifraam
Dam and said the following: ``No water will  be  taken  from  one  user  and
given to another user.'' This is not our only concern. Our main  concern  is
the quality of water of the people of the West Coast. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I was just remarking to my colleague  behind  me
here what an excellent speech she made, because many of the  things  that  I
wanted to say, she has said, and therefore I will be very brief about them.
Many of us - and certainly my party - are pleased with the  announcement  of
the Skuifraam Dam. But we are concerned about  it.  We  are  concerned  that
comprehensive impact assessment should be done as  far  as  the  Berg  River
floodplain and the whole estuary are concerned.  The  estuary  is  not  only
important from a natural point of view, but also from a fisheries  point  of
view. There is a huge spawning area for fisheries in that area. It could  be
very sensitive to the kind of things that we would like to  do  upstream.  I
am not saying that they should not be done and being a prophet  of  doom.  I
am just saying: As far as it is humanly possible, we should have as close  a
look as we can before we start.

In principle we know that, given the development of  the  Western  Cape,  we
simply have to build that dam if we can. It is also  true  to  say  that  my
colleague  was  absolutely  right  in  that  the  whole  question  of  water
management  and  the  water  management  policy  of  the   unicity   becomes
absolutely crucial.

It is true  that  the  unicity  is  the  only  bedding  down  now,  with  14
municipalities   coming   together   and   going   through   a   period   of
transformation. Nevertheless, it should be a priority  for  the  unicity  to
develop its water management policy plan. It is true to  say,  confirmed  by
responsible opinion that we could effect savings of easily  20%  of  current
water consumption given a  comprehensive  water  management  plan:  That  is
roughly the capacity  of  the  Skuifraam  Dam,  so  water  management  would
stretch our water resources for a much longer time and  give  us  much  more
water safety and be a wiser management of our scarce reserves.

I would like to know what the Minister means  when  he  talks  about  ``off-
budget expenditure''; of the dam being financed in such way that is  not  on
the budget and that it is going to be financed by the water  rates  paid  by
the consumers of the water. Does he mean that the water from  the  Skuifraam
Dam would be sold, or  is  he  saying  that  all  water  that  is  currently
impounded will be sold at an increased rate, which would  actually  pay  for
Skuifraam? Will Skuifraam pay for Skuifraam, or will Skuifraam plus all  the
existing fresh impounded water pay for Skuifraam? How does he intend  to  do
that and has he got any idea as how  that  is  likely  to  impact  on  water
rates? It is quite critical for us in the Western  Cape  because  a  lot  of
water is used for agriculture. One cannot farm with expensive water.  It  is
impossible.

That brings me to the Olifants River Basin. The hon the Minister would  know
that that whole river system is under stress in terms of shortages of  water
that are coming to the fore. That is quite difficult, because,  firstly,  it
is a poor part of our country and agriculture  is  a  very,  very  important
element  in  development  in  that  part  of  our  country.  Agriculture  is
locomotive for the agri-industry  and  for  many  other  kinds  of  economic
activities. We cannot slow down the  growth  in  agriculture  and  water  is
fundamental in order to expand in this area. A great many of the  previously
disadvantaged farmers also need water ... [Time expired.]

Dr  E  A  CONROY:  Hon  Chairperson,  Minister   and   colleagues,   Gauteng
congratulates the Minister and his department on the excellent work done  in
the last three years, whereby 4 million more people have been  connected  to
running water, bringing the total to 7  million  since  1994.  We  celebrate
with these 7 million people and look forward to the ongoing efforts  of  the
Minister in achieving what must be one of the  most  fundamental  rights  of
people.

We know the Minister is concerned about the challenge of  putting  in  place
systems which can sustain this progress. We share this concern. The  reality
of poverty in both urban and rural communities means that often  this  water
is cut off because water systems could not be maintained and repaired.

Despite our commitment to free basic water for all, financial problems  have
resulted in many local governments disconnecting supplies to people who  are
too poor to pay water bills. In order to achieve this right  to  free  basic
water  for  all,  we  need  to  ensure  that  our  systems  of  co-operative
governance are continually improved in order to achieve  greater  efficiency
and effectiveness in delivering basic services.

In Gauteng we are ready to support this. We  are  deeply  aware  that  local
government plays an important role in our system  of  governance.  It  is  a
delivery and development organ of the state which  is  the  closest  to  our
people. Premier Shilowa of Gauteng has announced that over  the  next  three
years we will assist municipalities to implement effective billing  systems,
revenue collection,  debt  management,  integration  of  systems,  financial
viability  and  sound  procurement  and  tendering  processes  through   the
municipal institutional support centre.  This  will,  by  strengthening  the
capacity of municipalities, enhance our collective responsibility to  ensure
that the goal of a minimum amount of free water  for  all  is  progressively
achieved and sustained.

One of the greatest challenges  for  co-operative  governance  is  effective
service delivery in cross-border municipalities. In  February,  the  Gauteng
premier  announced  that,  together  with  national   Government   and   our
counterparts in Mpumalanga and the North West, we  have  reached  agreements
on joint administration on  local  government  matters  and  methodology  to
address issues such as  the  effective  utilisation  of  combined  municipal
infrastructure programme funds in cross-boundary municipalities.

We reiterate our call made on the NCOP last year for  the  NCOP  to  send  a
team to look at whether we are living  up  to  our  commitment  to  ensuring
equitable service provision in  cross-boundary  municipalities.  Of  course,
the delivery of water and sanitation is the most crucial component  of  this
service  delivery.  The  premier's  co-ordinating  forum  will  continue  to
address the issue of service delivery, the  challenge  of  homelessness  and
the provision of  water,  electricity  and  much-needed  sanitation  to  our
communities.

We also welcome the publication of the White Paper on sanitation. This is  a
service fundamental to the health  of  our  people,  in  particular  the  18
million who do not yet  have  access  to  basic  sanitation.  We  share  the
Minister's concern at the fact that more than 40 000 children die each  year
from diarrhoea caused by dirty water. We share his deep  concern  about  the
ongoing incidence of cholera. In view of this desperate human  need,  it  is
crucial that the Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  makes  every
effort to complete all budgeted-for water  and  sanitation  projects  within
each financial year. Whatever the blockages may be in terms of capacity,  by
means of co-operative governances these issues must be resolved so that  our
valuable resources are indeed directed to the poorest of the poor.

We look forward to participating in the Minister's plan to work  intensively
with municipalities in consultation on the White Paper. In Gauteng  we  will
support this process  so  that  all  tiers  of  government  share  a  common
understanding of and commitment to implementing the  measures  envisaged  in
the White Paper and aligning the work of  our  officials  to  achieve  these
goals.

In Gauteng we have decided, after taking into account that more than 25%  of
areas in Gauteng do not have adequate water and sanitation, that we are  now
ready to launch a project that will deal with this  challenge  in  the  next
four years. With the support of the Minister of Water Affairs and  Forestry,
and together with local government and through the Mayibuye project and  the
combined municipal infrastructure programme, we will help to  provide  every
citizen in established and planned settlement areas  with  clean  water  and
healthy sanitation at an appropriate level of service.

In his opening address to the legislature, Premier  Shilowa  announced  that
R1,4 billion would be allocated for the provision of on-site  services  over
the four-year period.

I would  also  like  to  refer  to  the  problem  of  water  pollution.  The
responsibility for effective  systems  of  preventing  water  pollution  and
ensuring that the polluter pays is the responsibility  of  the  Minister  of
Water Affairs and Forestry.

A year ago on World Environment Day we held a conference in Gauteng  on  the
state  of  the  environment  in  Gauteng.  Minister  Kasrils   graced   that
conference with his presence, for which we wish to thank  him  again  today.
It was noted that  the  environmental  pressures  on  Gauteng  are  enormous
because it is a  province  with  an  ever-increasing  human  population  and
development pressures  caused  in  part  by  influx  from  other  provinces.
Industrialisation,  urban  sprawl,  informal  settlements,  high  population
densities and mining all contribute to  pollution,  resource  depletion  and
environmental degradation.

The conference confirmed the commitment of all  in  Gauteng  to  sustainable
utilisation of our natural,  social,  economic  and  cultural  resources  in
order to progressively achieve the rights enshrined in the  Bill  of  Rights
in the Constitution to sufficient food  and  water  and  a  safe  and  clean
living environment for our generation and,  most  importantly,  to  leave  a
legacy of sustainability for the generations to come.

The conference called upon  Minister  Kasrils  to  work  together  with  all
departments and levels of  Government  to  ensure  development,  repair  and
maintenance of  infrastructure  such  as  our  sewage  system  in  order  to
guarantee environmental health. Most importantly, it  called  upon  the  hon
the  Minister  and  others  to  work  diligently  to  establish  a   working
monitoring  and  enforcement   system   that   includes   incentives   where
appropriate  and  the  use  of   penalties   to   ensure   compliance   with
environmental norms and standards.

The hon the Minister is aware of  the  massive  pollution  of  the  national
water resources  in  Gauteng  as  a  consequence  of  mining  pollution  and
pollution from a range of industrial activities. He is  also  aware  of  the
problem of open holings across the  length  of  the  Witwatersrand  and  the
implications of  this  for  groundwater  levels  and  for  the  marginalised
communities who live in close proximity to these dangerous holings.

The Gauteng Mining Pollution Forum has been informed  that  a  report  on  a
study on water ingress  from  holings  recommended  that  the  state  should
establish a strategic  water  management  committee,  prepare  an  executive
summary  and  also  determine  which  of  the  ingress  points   should   be
prioritised for closure. We request the hon the  Minister  to  support  this
decision to fill up the holings. In doing  so,  there  is  a  need  to  work
closely  with  the  relevant  municipalities,  particularly  the  Ekurhuleni
metropolitan council.

Gauteng thanks Minister Kasrils for his commitment to  our  people  and,  in
particular, to the poor, among  whom  the  greatest  number  are  women.  We
applaud his dedication to the tasks he has been given. We  look  forward  to
working closely with him to achieve a better life for all. [Applause.]

Cllr M MVOKO (Salga): Madam Chair,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  as  a
starting point I would like to  say  that  Salga  and  Department  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry have developed better working  relationships  over  the
past six months with the establishment of the water services sector
leadership group, of which Salga is an active member.

Furthermore, in January 2002, with  Masibambane  and  donor  support,  Salga
revitalised  its  water  and  sanitation  technical  support   team,   which
subsequently  brought  in  local  government  expertise  enabling  Salga  to
proactively engage in a range of policy and programme  matters  through  the
various sector working groups, such as the National Transfer Task  Team  and
the National Sanitation Task Team.

Turning to the Budget Vote in question,  Salga  supports  the  Vote  on  the
whole when read in conjunction with  the  Division  of  Revenue  Act,  which
briefly describes an exit strategy  for  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry with regard  to  its  capital  infrastructure  programme.  However,
Salga  wishes  to  comment  around  key  policy  priority  issues  such   as
institutional restructuring, the transfer of water services,  water  boards,
2010 waste-water standards and free basic services.

Although the aspect of water institutional restructuring is not a  programme
in the budget on which we  can  comment,  we  understand  that  thinking  is
taking place around the long-term institutional look and size of  Department
of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  after  the  establishment  of   catchment
management agencies. Hitherto, Salga's involvement  in  water  institutional
restructuring  has  been  requested  more  in  respect  of  water  services.
However, even national  water  resources  restructuring  will  fundamentally
impact on local government and, therefore, Salga requests that this  process
proceed with the full participation of local government from the outset.

We understand that there are somewhat separate debates around  the  national
utility, CMAs and the role of water boards, all of which, we  believe,  will
most probably dovetail. We therefore support these debates being  approached
across the spectrum of both water resources and water services at  the  same
time. Our concern is that we find ourselves in a similar situation  as  with
the introduction of rates, where a department substantially  considered  the
concept before Salga was consulted on the general concept.

Salga has identified the transfer of water services as a critical issue  for
municipalities, but it is not clear under which of the eight  programmes  in
the Vote the transfer of water services has been  included.  Because  it  is
difficult to ascertain in the budget, we raise the question  as  to  whether
there are  sufficient  funds  for  both  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry and local government to manage the transfer process.

A joint study in 2001 gave a first estimate of once-off  costs  required  to
implement the transfer process of  R1,8  billion.  It  must  be  noted  that
approximately half of this was costs of the Department of Water Affairs  and
Forestry, but the other half was municipality  costs.  Furthermore,  it  was
found  that  substantial,  ongoing  subsidy  requirements  were  needed   to
maintain transferred schemes, a point Salga  will  be  taking  up  with  the
national Treasury, the Department of Provincial  and  Local  Government  and
the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in the near future.

We therefore need to disagree with  the  statement  in  the  Vote  that  the
persistent shortfall in the  Water  Trading  Account  will  end  when  water
service  schemes  are  transferred  to  local  government.  This  persistent
shortfall  will  merely  be  transferred  to  municipalities.  The  question
remains: What cross-subsidisation mechanisms will be put in place to  assist
local government in this regard?

The Water Trading Account is further unpacked in  the  Division  of  Revenue
Act schedules which make it possible to identify the amounts the  Department
of Water Affairs and Forestry has budgeted  for  the  management,  operation
and maintenance of national  Government  water  schemes  in  each  municipal
area. However, there are a few municipalities that have  initiated  transfer
negotiations with the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry  and,  during
this process, determined the adequacy of the  budgets  in  the  Division  of
Revenue Act to manage, operate and maintain the present  infrastructure.  In
all instances, the budget, in the opinion of the  municipal  engineers,  was
far from adequate, which led Salga to assume that either  the  schemes  were
being undermaintained or the Department of Water Affairs  and  Forestry  had
budgeted incorrectly.

Therefore, even if the funds currently going  to  the  Department  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry  to  manage,  operate  and  maintain  the  schemes  are
redirected to the municipality coffers, in order to maintain the schemes  to
desired standards, additional funds will be required,  either  from  revenue
collected or from the national Government.

Salga is unsure whether the three-year  timeframes  for  transfer  of  water
services were introduced. We have discussed the matter  and  put  on  record
that  even   though   municipalities   are   willing   to   take   immediate
responsibility for operation  and  maintenance  of  the  schemes,  financial
viability of these schemes  will  not  be  achieved  in  three  years.  From
experience, we believe that this could take between five and ten years.

On the matter of water boards, we notice with concern the  large  amount  of
R106,4 million set aside for water boards during this year, with only  a  4%
decrease in this amount over the next three years, to a projected amount  of
R102,5 million in 2004-05. This validates Salga's concern in respect of  the
financial viability and justification of the existence of some of the  water
boards. Because of this fact, and in the light of the establishment  of  new
institutions, combined with a  review  currently  being  undertaken  on  the
water boards, we  believe  and  hope  that  this  allocation  might  not  be
required in the future.

Salga has been aware of the proposed 2010  waste-water  standards  for  some
time now. Some of our municipalities have made technical assessments on  the
upgrading of treatment facilities that will be required to  treat  water  to
these standards. Needless to say, the costs are prohibitive. With  a  finite
pool of financial resources, we question whether  free  basic  water  should
not be given priority over very high waste-water standards.

Our municipalities have not determined the  cost  of  free  basic  services,
although the definition of free basic services was  discussed  at  a  recent
meeting of a Salga water and sanitation task team.  Municipalities  find  it
somehow  disjointed  to  separate  water  and  sanitation  services  through
different policies which aim  to  increase  access  to  basic  services.  To
municipalities, policies that apply to water  should,  by  right,  apply  to
sanitation, and this cannot lead to a situation  where  the  level  of  free
basic water may have to be lowered.

Even though at  national  level  functions  might  be  divided  between  the
Department of Water Affairs and  Forestry  and  the  Department  of  Health,
municipalities have to deal with the present cost of  possibly  fluoridating
water. Again, these costs are exorbitant in most  instances,  and  Salga  is
raising this in the appropriate forums.

Now, we fully endorse the stated priority focus in  the  strategic  overview
of provision of support to local government in  performing  their  functions
as  a  water  services  authority.  We  recognise  that  the   capital   and
Masibambane   programmes   support   provinces   directly,   and   effective
institutional development  support  is  being  provided.  However,  this  is
inadequately  reflected  in  the  Vote.  For  example,  under  the  Regional
Implementation programme, the Sustainable Development and Management  budget
of approximately R10 million has an output indicator of training provided.

Likewise, under the Waste-Water Services Programme, the Local  Institutional
Development Support budget of the R22,6 million, yet again,  only  seems  to
focus on training, with a lot of emphasis  on  communities,  and  hence  its
targets, we believe, that are inexplicably only  focused  on  water  boards.
Whereas training has its place, we believe that the  priority  focus  should
be on the establishment of functioning water services authorities and  water
services provider arrangements with appropriately defined targets.

We are preparing detailed comments on all the aforementioned, which will  be
submitted to the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry for  inclusion  in
the water services' White Paper review  process.  As  Salga  has  been  less
involved in water resources and forestry, we have very limited  comments  to
make.

We understand that the country's small and  large  dams  that  do  not  hold
water but are considered a national resource will  also  be  transferred  to
municipalities. Furthermore,  municipalities  have  become  responsible  for
some farms in their areas of jurisdiction. With these two points we can  see
that the allocation of water is also a municipal issue, and therefore,  once
again, we  substantiate  our  request  that  the  restructuring  debates  be
approached across both water resources and water services.

I thank hon members for the time to respond to this Vote of  the  Department
of Water Affairs and Forestry in the hope that the relationship between  the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry  and  Salga  will  continue  to  be
interactive. It is a  working  example  of  intergovernmental  co-operation.
[Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  I  greet  you
all. Let me begin by congratulating the hon the Minister and the  department
for  continuing  to  reverse  the  apartheid  legacy  of  denying  essential
services to black people in particular. In the rural areas, adults, as  well
as children, suffer extensively. Schoolchildren who cannot obtain  water  at
their schools must suffer incredibly from  thirst  and  inconvenience  after
physical exertion.

The hon the Minister is quite aware about  water-borne  infectious  diseases
such  as  cholera  and  many  more.  The  spread  of  cholera  had  the  sad
consequence of water not being available.  It  is  good  that  I  heard  the
Minister mention cholera and everything. He is quite  aware  about  that.  I
thank the Minister very much for that.

In a similar way, other problems continue  to  afflict  rural  people  on  a
daily basis because of a lack of water. I therefore, on behalf of  the  IFP,
plead with the Minister to expend even more energy to ensure that  no  area,
especially in the rural areas, and no school  is  without  safe  and  secure
water.

Thina  be-IFP  siyalincoma   iqhaza   elibanjwe   umhlonishwa   uNgqongqoshe
wezaManzi  namaHlathi.  Siyawabona  amanzi  efika  nalapho   esasingacabangi
ukuthi ayofika khona. Phezu kunjalo  kusekhona  izikole  ezingenawo  amanzi.
Imfundo yabantwana iphazamiseka kakhulu lapho.

Kunezindawo ezibalulekile  emphakathini  ezinjengemitholampilo,  izibhedlela
nezinye eziphelelwa ngamanzi bese umphakathi uyahlupheka, izindlu  zangasese
zinuke zithi phu kugcwale izimpukane.

Umhlonishwa   uNgqongqoshe   usuke   ewafakile    amanzi    lapho.    Kusuke
sekungezasekhaya lezo zomasipala. Kuhle ngoba likhona ilungu leSalga  lapha.
Impela ukuphela kwamanzi kusuke kuyimbubhiso ezimpilweni zabantu.
Siyamcela umhlonishwa ukuba acabangele izimo  ezinjalo  esabelweni  sezimali
sakhe. Amanzi ayimpilo, singephile ngaphandle kwawo.  (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[We, the IFP, appreciate the role played by the Minister  of  Water  Affairs
and Forestry. We see water coming to areas where  we  thought  it  would  be
impossible for them to have  water.  In  spite  of  that,  there  are  still
schools that do not have water. Children's education is greatly affected  in
those areas.

There are important institutions in the community, like  clinics,  hospitals
and  others,  that  are  running  short  of  water  and  the  community   is
experiencing hardship. Toilets smell bad and flies flock to them.

The hon the Minister has already installed  water  there.  That  belongs  to
municipalities, it is local. It is good, because a  Salga  member  is  here.
Really, the shortage of water is a disaster in the people's lives.
We ask the Minister to consider such situations  in  his  budget.  Water  is
life, we cannot live without it.]

The IFP acknowledges the work of the Minister and  his  department,  and  we
support the Budget Vote.

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, I cannot  begin  to
stress the importance of water. It is a limited resource  with  a  multitude
of demands. We need it for drinking, cooking and washing.  We  need  it  for
sanitation to keep our  homes  and  our  communities  healthy  and  free  of
disease. Safe water  and  adequate  sanitation  are  essential  for  health.
Therefore, access to clean, safe water and sanitation  services  is  crucial
for our democracy.

Water  is  essential  in   ensuring   sustainable   social,   economic   and
environmental benefits for all. A better life for all demands  that  we  all
have access to water and that we benefit from it. Without  the  majority  of
our  people  having  access  to  water,  we  cannot  have  a   healthy   and
economically and socially viable society.

Unfortunately, owing to the legacies  of  our  past,  accessibility  by  the
majority of the people, in particular the  rural  sector,  still  remains  a
challenge, but the situation is definitely not a basket  case,  because  the
Government of the  people  is  committed  to  poverty  alleviation,  to  the
wellbeing of our people and to redressing the injustices  of  the  past,  in
particular in the water sector.

A lot has changed since we obtained our democracy, thanks to the  Government
of the day, in particular, the Department of Water Affairs and  Forestry.  I
would like to extend my congratulations to the department on the  impressive
work they have done thus far.  It  has  not  been  an  easy  road,  but  the
department has managed and still is managing one of our challenging  sectors
with high enthusiasm, vigour and commitment. I  would  like  to  express  my
gratitude for the level of their commitment to making sure that the  poorest
of the poor in our country do have access to water through  the  free  basic
water policy.

More people now have access to free water and are not  deterred  from  using
water supplies owing to their high cost or simply because they are  poor.  I
am proud to say that today about 66% of the population has  access  to  free
water. The tariff structure in Durban, in my province,  ensures  that  every
household has an adequate supply  of  water.  This  further  contributes  to
water conservation.

In the poor rural areas of my  province,  KwaZulu-Natal,  where  people  are
served by standpipes, water is still provided without their  being  charged.
The rationale behind this is born out of the reality  that  the  poorest  do
not have access to water and, therefore, it is not  a  privilege  but  their
right to have access to water.

The department has embarked on the Working for Water programme, which  seeks
to enhance water security, restore and  improve  biodiversity;  restore  the
productive potential of land; develop economic  benefits  from  wood,  land,
water and trained people; and invest in the  most  marginalised  sectors  of
our country and enhance their quality of life through job creation.

With job creation, millions  of  our  people's  lives  are  being  improved.
Children will have access to quality education and families will be fed.  On
that note,  on  behalf  of  my  committee,  I  would  like  to  applaud  the
department. I say well done and keep it up. It is the  job  creation  aspect
which makes  the  programme  so  wonderful  in  terms  of  the  Government's
commitment to social responsibility.

Allow me to highlight some  of  the  spin-offs  of  the  Working  For  Water
programme. Not only does it create a platform for job creation, but it  also
empowers the emerging contractors who will have to exit the programme  after
a certain period, having gained the necessary  skills  and  the  culture  of
contracting. This programme also empowers  the  workers  on  the  ground  by
offering education and training in basic skills.  They  will  then  stand  a
better chance on the job market after acquiring  these  skills.  A  case  in
point is the Dukuduku Forest project in KwaZulu-Natal. In  addition,  social
development  issues  like  crèches,  literacy  and  HIV/Aids  awareness  are
addressed. This programme  emphasises  gender  empowerment  as  60%  of  the
contractors and workers must be women.

As we all know, nothing comes without obstacles and challenges.  As  I  have
stated before, this sector has been a very  challenging  sector.  Therefore,
it would be fair for me to point out some of the challenges. We need  to  be
aware of our shortcomings for us to improve on them. One of the  constraints
facing the Working for Water programme is the  limited  financial  resources
at its disposal. Yet, the problem of invasive plants is so huge, because  it
compounds itself. More  financial  resources  should  be  allocated  to  the
programme, otherwise the good work achieved thus far will be in vain.

Certain  municipalities  are  still  struggling  to  set  up  physical   and
accounting systems to implement the supply  of  free  basic  water.  At  the
present moment, my province, KwaZulu-Natal, together with the  Eastern  Cape
and the Northern Cape, reflect a lower percentage of people  receiving  free
basic water. In the Western Cape and Gauteng about 90% and 91%  respectively
have access to free basic water, compared to my  province,  in  which  about
39% have access. A lot still needs to be done for us as a  nation  in  order
to meet our target.

Sanitation has been another major problem, especially  in  my  province.  It
has been directly linked to the outbreak of cholera. We  hope  that  cholera
prevention will continue to target communities at  risk,  in  particular  in
KwaZulu-Natal, with support and education, emphasising  the  three  barriers
to waterborne diseases: safe water, sanitation and hygiene awareness.

Let me conclude by congratulating the Minister on the  excellent  budget.  I
feel that it is important to note that the  budget  has  increased  by  7,1%
from 1998-99 to 2001-02. I think we all agree  that  this  is  something  to
make us smile, in particular the broader South African  population,  because
it can only mean a better future for all. [Applause.]
Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, comrade Minister, hon  members,  distinguished
guests, when we think about water in this  country,  what  springs  to  mind
immediately is firstly the tens of thousands of citizens in the rural  areas
of our country who  still  have  to  walk  miles  in  order  to  get  clean,
drinkable  water  in  order  to  survive.  Secondly,  we   contemplate   the
challenges we still face in order to wipe out  the  historical  backlog.  It
goes without saying that this remains the immediate priority  of  this  ANC-
led Government and indeed of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry.

One of the stated aims of the department is to ensure  that  water  services
are provided to all South  Africans  in  an  efficient,  cost-effective  and
sustainable  way,  and  the  department  must  be  recommended   for   their
unwavering efforts in doing just that.

Let us have a look at the facts. Since 1994, more than 6,5  million  people,
or 66% of our people, who had no basic water supply, were provided  for  and
now have access to this  valuable  resource.  An  important  initiative  was
started in September 2000 when President  Thabo  Mbeki  announced  that  the
Government would ensure that poor households could obtain a basic supply  of
6 000 litres of free water per month. This has given us the  distinction  of
being a country which has met the millennium water supply target set by  the
United Nations in 2000.

Although this is a function of  local  government,  the  department  set  in
motion a range of processes in all three spheres of Government to  implement
policies, one of which was the development of financial  motives  to  assist
local authorities with their implementation.

The fact  that  the  department's  community  water  supply  and  sanitation
programme was  awarded  the  prestigious  Water  Globe  Award  for  2002  is
testimony and a tribute to their dedication and commitment.

However, we also have to face the fact that about 7 million  people  in  our
rural areas still do not have access to clean water and about 20 million  do
not have acceptable sanitation. We are also faced with images  of  women  on
television and in the print media who  are  still  covering  long  distances
with buckets of water on their heads and shoulders.

Our province, the Northern Cape, lies to the south  of  its  most  important
asset, the mighty Orange River, which  provides  the  basis  for  a  healthy
agricultural industry. It also has a rich mining industry and  it  is  self-
explanatory that water indeed underpins our economy.

At present, about 92% of  our  municipalities  in  the  Northern  Cape  have
implemented the free water services. Most of  these  beneficiaries  are  the
poorest  of  the  poor.  However,  due  to  infrastructural  backlogs,  some
municipalities  are  still  experiencing  difficulties  in  providing  these
services to the indigent, especially in our semi-rural and rural  areas.  In
some parts of our province water is a scarce  resource  owing  to  a  narrow
strip of winter rainfall area along the coast, and we believe that  together
we  can  overturn  this  situation  through  partnerships  with  the  public
utilities and the private sector.
As a province we are, in  fact,  very  happy  with  the  visit  by  the  hon
Minister in April this year as part  of  the  Government's  imbizo  week  to
acquaint himself with the various projects under way. One  such  project  is
the Working for Water project which removes the  invasive  alien  vegetation
that has grown like a plague to threaten our  aquatic  system.  At  present,
six project areas are under way and this is greatly contributing to  poverty
alleviation in these areas.

This programme has  a  key  role  to  play  in  achieving  integrated  rural
development, with a key partnership between  various  departments.  We  also
appreciate Minister Kasrils' ``Wash'' campaign to raise awareness about  the
value of good sanitation and hygiene. We are confident  that  this  campaign
will conscientise people about the importance of taking care  of  their  own
health.

We are also pleased with the announcement  that  the  Minister  in  February
this year of the publication of a national  water  resource  strategy.  This
will certainly provide the  framework  within  which  South  Africa's  water
resources  will  be  protected,  used,  developed,  conserved,  managed  and
controlled. It will indicate, for instance, where  water  is  available  for
development and for additional irrigation.

Moreover, it will identify where new  investment  will  be  needed  to  meet
domestic and municipal needs as well as where difficult choices have  to  be
made, for example, between power stations and new mines. The  strategy  will
provide the basis for achieving fair arrangements with neighbours who  share
our rivers.

When I visited Carnarvon on Freedom Day, I encountered something  which  was
really not acceptable, whereas the official from  the  Department  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry came and wanted to implement the VIP toilet  system  in
Carnarvon. I was confronted with this particular matter, and it  looks  like
our people out there are not happy with that particular system.  I  want  to
appeal  to  the  Minister  that  we  perhaps  go  down  there  ourselves  to
investigate what the problems are. People are not too  happy  with  the  VIP
toilet system in Carnarvon. I think we should go there, listen to  them  and
communicate with them, and I am sure they will tell us what  their  problems
are.

My home town, De  Aar,  is  a  place  with  hardly  any  water.  There  were
discussions in  our  province  that  we  should  apply  our  minds  to  this
particular problem. With the PK Le Roux Dam being about 110 km from De  Aar,
there was a view in the province that we should sit down with  the  Ministry
and the department to see if there was perhaps any  possibility  for  us  to
either get a pipeline from the PK Le Roux Dam or  a  water  channel  in  the
direction of De Aar. I know this will cost a  lot  of  money,  but  this  is
something that we need to pay attention to.

In conclusion, this Government has had remarkable  success  with  delivering
water to the previously unserved population of this country. Government  has
also adopted a national implementation strategy to eliminate the backlog  by
2010. We are optimistic about achieving this delivery  milestone.  In  terms
of our Constitution, the provision of water and sanitation services are  the
responsibility of local government, but national and  provincial  government
should assist them,  monitor  their  performance  and  intervene  only  when
necessary.

In order for all of these activities to be successful we need to  strengthen
capacity at local government level,  draw  on  the  strength  of  our  local
authorities, and involve our community structures  in  order  to  reach  the
objective of a better life for all. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, what I have said in this debate on behalf of  my
province, Gauteng, I could just as well have said on  behalf  of  my  party,
the New NP. I will therefore not take up the time  allocated  to  my  party,
save to say that the New NP fully identifies itself with the context of  the
speech I delivered a few  minutes  ago.  We  would  also  like  to  add  our
congratulations to Minister Kasrils on the  outstanding  work  done  by  his
department. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): That  was  very  good,
Doctor.

Me A ROSSOUW (Wes-Kaap): Voorsitter, ek neem namens die  Wes-Kaap  deel  aan
hierdie debat. Ek dink nou nie ek gaan so gaaf wees soos wat Dr  Conroy  was
nie, maar nietemin is dit vir my 'n voorreg. Dit is die derde  jaar  wat  ek
aan hierdie debat deelneem en dit is altyd vir my lekker, want  komende  van
die platteland, is die bewaring van ons water  vir  mens  van  allergrootste
belang. Water is lewe. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Ms A ROSSOUW (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  I  am  participating  in  this
debate on behalf of the Western Cape. I do not think that I will be as  kind
as Dr Conroy, but it is nevertheless a privilege for me.  It  is  the  third
year that I am participating in this debate and it  is  always  a  pleasure,
because coming from the rural areas, the conservation of  water  is  of  the
utmost importance to one. Water is life.]

The management of our water resources and our forests is very important  for
sustainable development in South Africa.  In  the  context  of  the  Western
Cape, it is well known that our flora  is  threatened  by  alien  vegetation
which removes millions of kilolitres of ground water per annum.  This  water
is lost as a result of the high water consumption of vegetation that we  can
well do without. The approach that must be adopted in order  to  manage  the
resources I have spoken about needs to be one that is based on  co-operative
governance.

It is not widely appreciated that the maintenance of the water resources  of
the country is closely linked to the conservation of natural  areas  and  to
biodiversity.  Not  only  does  the  maintenance  of  a  natural  cover   of
vegetation result in an optimal runoff  of  high-quality  unpolluted  water,
but the maintenance of natural rivers and wetlands also plays crucial  roles
in the water cycle and provides numerous other benefits to society, such  as
flood control.

Close co-operation is therefore essential  among  the  Department  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry,  conservation  agencies,  such  as  the  Western  Cape
Nature Conservation Board, and the provincial and national departments  that
are responsible for environmental affairs, planning and agriculture.

The Western Cape province is extremely fortunate that  far-sighted  policies
resulted in the protection of most of the major mountain catchments  of  the
region as nature reserves, wilderness areas and other state forests,  or  in
the case of private land, as protected catchments in terms of  the  Mountain
Catchment Areas Act, Act 63 of 1990.

Although these protected mountain catchments cover only 9% of the  province,
about 1,2 million hectares, they protect the source of more than 50% of  the
water resources of this region. This is because the runoff is greatest  from
the mountains owing to the higher rainfall and  the  cover  of  the  natural
fynbos vegetation.

The Western Cape Nature Conservation Board is responsible for managing  most
of the protected areas in the mountains of the Western Cape as well  as  for
administering of the Mountain Catchment Areas Act  in  the  privately  owned
protected catchments.

The greatest threat to the water resources of the region is the invasion  of
catchment areas and rivers by exotic  trees,  such  as  pines  and  wattles.
These invasive  species  form  dense  thickets  that  can  cause  a  drastic
reduction in water runoff by more than 50%. Fortunately, this threat to  our
water resources is being addressed by the Department of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry through  the  Working  for  Water  programme  that  aims  to  clear
invasive alien vegetation from catchment areas and rivers.  In  the  Western
Cape, the Nature Conservation Board is the main implementing agent  of  this
programme, and also provides  jobs  to  hundreds  of  previously  unemployed
people. The development of skills is  an  important  additional  benefit  of
this programme.

Forestry plantations are also  a  threat  to  the  water  resources  of  the
region, due to reduction of runoff that is  comparable  to  that  caused  by
thickets of invasive trees. However, a decision has  already  been  made  to
phase out most of the state-owned plantations that are currently  under  the
control of Safcol. This decision was based not only on  the  impact  of  the
plantations on the water  resources  of  the  region,  but  was  also  taken
because  most  of  the  plantations  in  the  Western  Cape  are  inherently
uneconomic. The restoration of the plantations to natural  cover  of  fynbos
vegetation will have immediate economic benefits, by increasing  runoffs  to
dams by more than 50%.

As already stated, co-operative governance is taken very  seriously  in  the
Western Cape, and several new working groups were established in the  1990s,
such as the Provincial Water Liaison Committee, where top management of  the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in the  region  meets  with  senior
officials of the different  departments  in  the  province  on  a  quarterly
basis.

The greatest boost for co-operative governance came from  the  drafting  and
passage of the new South African Water Act of  1998.  Environmentalists  and
aquatic scientists contributed extensively to the  development  of  what  is
one of  the  most  advanced  and  environmentally  friendly  water  Acts  in
existence. Several provisions and  large  portions  of  the  Act  deal  with
conservation and the wise management  of  water  resources,  with  the  only
right to water being the environmental reserve. The reserve  allows  for  an
assured minimal water allocation to maintain the health of  aquatic  systems
as well as an  allocation  for  basic  human  needs.  In  addition,  several
resource protection measures are part  of  the  Act  to  ensure  the  future
conservation of rivers and other inland waters.

The drafting of effective environmental  legislation,  such  as  the  impact
assessment regulations of 1997, identified  several  listed  activities  for
which an environmental assessment was necessary.  Several  of  these  listed
activities affected water resource development and since they were  part  of
national legislation, it became essential that  co-operative  governance  be
facilitated between the departments dealing  with  culture  and  sport,  and
that  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  ensures  that  the
development evaluation process be as effective as possible.

An example of the progress that is being made with  regard  to  co-operative
governance is the memorandum of understanding  concerning  the  streamlining
of review processes of application to  cultivate  new  land  that  has  been
drawn up between the provincial Departments  of  Agriculture,  Environmental
and Cultural Affairs and Sport in the Western Cape, the Western Cape  Nature
Conservation  Board,  the  national  Departments  of   Water   Affairs   and
Agriculture, and the South African Heritage Resources Agency.

A committee  is  also  being  established  for  the  implementation  of  the
regulations of the Conservation of Agricultural  Resources  Act  to  enforce
the clearing of invasive species on  private  land.  Co-operative  decisions
regarding the application for permits for new afforestation are  also  being
addressed.

Another important initiative is the national  River  Health  Programme  that
has  developed  from  the  new  Water  Act  with  the  aim  of  getting  all
stakeholders in river management involved in caring for our rivers.  Several
inititatives have been developed to promote a  consistent  method  of  river
monitoring across South Africa. Both the Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
the  Western  Cape  Nature  Conservation  Board  are  actively  involved  in
implementing this programme in the Western Cape, and the Lourens  and  Klein
Brak Rivers have been chosen as pilot projects.  A  steering  committee  has
been established with local authority, university and  community  groups  to
guide the implementation of the programme here.

It is  clear  that  a  key  limitation  in  implementing  the  River  Health
Programme locally is the lack of sufficient capacity in the aquatic  science
field at both departments.  I  am  pleased  to  announce  that  negotiations
between our departments are at an advanced stage,  in  terms  of  which  the
Western Cape Nature Conservation Board will, on a contract basis, provide  a
service to the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in the Western  Cape
to ensure the effective implementation of this important programme here.

Another working group that has progressed from strength to strength  is  the
Western Cape Aquaculture Working  Group,  established  in  1991  to  promote
sustainable  aquaculture  in  our   province.   This   group   consists   of
representatives of the Department of Agriculture in the  Western  Cape,  the
Department of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,  the  Western  Cape  Producers'
Organisation,  researchers  and  representatives  of   the   Department   of
Agriculture, Environmental  and  Cultural  Affairs  and  Cape  Conservation.
Adequate  funding  for  the  water  resource  protection   and   management,
including the management of natural areas  that  serve  as  water  catchment
areas, remains a problem. However, the Department of Water Affairs has  made
considerable progress towards implementing the user-pays principle  for  the
use of water, since all users of water, will have to pay a  levy  for  water
from 1 April 2002.

In closing, it is important for all of us to realise that the  provision  of
water in our homes, in factories, and for  agriculture  requires  close  co-
operation  between  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs   and   our   nature
conservation planning and other land management  agencies  and  departments.
Thanks to  this  growing  co-operation  the  future  looks  bright  for  the
sustainable use of  our  precious  water  resources  in  the  Western  Cape.
[Applause.]

Mr R  M  NYAKANE:  Chairperson,  I  think  the  hon  the  Minister  and  the
department are quite aware that  they  are  obliged,  in  terms  of  section
27(1)(b) of our national Constitution, to ensure  that  every  citizen  gets
sufficient water supply. It would be naive of me not to appreciate that  not
all towns and villages in the Limpopo  province  suffer  acute  scarcity  of
potable water supply. However, we still observe an  unacceptable  number  of
villages and small towns that are deprived of their right of  access  to  an
adequate potable water supply.

Long queues of rural women are still seen at the  borehole  sites  with  20-
litre plastic containers, which is an  indication  that  water  scarcity  is
still a problem. As I  stand  and  address  this  House,  villages  such  as
Croquetlawn, Marite, Timbavati, etc, have been without water  for  the  past
three weeks. They are in the Bushbuckridge area.  When  pump  operators  are
called upon to come and help,  their  response  is  that  they  cannot  come
before they get an OK from head office, apparently referring to Pretoria  or
Pietersburg, we do not know. What an unnecessary excuse!

The new development is that the department will  embark  on  a  three-  year
programme, effective from 1 April 2002,  to  transfer  all  water  services,
schemes  and  projects  to  the  local  governments.  I  think   this   will
undoubtedly address this problem. However,  we  are  still  sitting  with  a
capacity backlog  with  municipalities,  and  we  appeal  therefore  to  the
department not to cut off completely its  links  with  local  government.  I
think we should appreciate that transformation is a  process  that  needs  a
considerable period of nurturing.

Perhaps it is high time that we  employ  the  lady  and  the  gentleman  who
accompanied the Minister in KwaZulu-Natal, in the  municipalities,  to  show
the municipalities how to deal with this matter of water supply, because  it
appears they have certain skills.

Before I conclude addressing water issues, may  I  indicate  to  this  House
that the major dams in Limpopo, such as the Middle Letaba,  Arabi,  Tzaneen,
Nsami and Njaka are still full to capacity since the  last  heavy  rainfall.
We do not have a problem as far as abundance of water is  concerned  in  the
Limpopo province. However, the bottom-line  problems  are  the  inconsistent
state of  repair  of  the  infrastructure,  eg  conveyance  pipelines,  pump
machines and the scarcity of parts. These  are  the  problems  that  we  are
experiencing. We hope that the  transfer  of  an  operating  budget  to  the
municipalities will help eradicate this particular problem.

When the Minister presented the department's budget, I became aware  of  the
fact that he had set aside R24  million  for  the  pursuance  of  sanitation
projects in the Limpopo province. It will be in the interest of the  Limpopo
residents to know  where,  or  rather,  in  which  villages,  they  will  be
undertaking these sanitation projects. The Limpopo province appeals for  the
funding to be spent ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

uMnu V V Z WINDVOëL:  Mgcinisihlalo,  Ndvuna  lehlon  kanye  nani  bekunene,
angeke  ngisaba  mudze  kakhulu  njengobe   naku   ngisikhulumi   sekugcina.
Lokunyenti labanye balingani bami sebakukhulumile. (Translation  of  Siswati
paragraph follows.)

[Mr V V W WINDVOëL: Hon Chairperson and hon members,  I  will  not  be  long
with my speech, especially seeing that I am the last  speaker  of  the  day.
Most has been said by my colleagues.]

Without water there is no life, and without clean and safe  water  there  is
no happy life. Thus, water is the most precious natural  resource  God  gave
us. One may have tons of gold, but without water one will not only  go  dry-
mouthed, one will perish.

The UN Millennium Declaration has as one of its objectives to lessen by  50%
the proportion of people who are unable to reach  or  afford  safe  drinking
water by the year 2015. The Department of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  has
made significant  strides  with  regard  to  this.  Since  1994,  353  water
services projects have  benefited  close  to  7  million  people.  This  has
ensured that water and sanitation services meet the needs of the poor,  low-
income and vulnerable groups, and are also gender-sensitive.

While commending the department on their ongoing progress on this aspect  of
service delivery to the people, one must raise  concern  regarding  some  of
the uncompleted water projects not budgeted for in the subsequent  financial
year. We must also call  on  our  citizens  to  positively  co-operate  with
Government to ensure efficient and economical use of water resources.

Due to time constraints, I will  not  dwell  on  certain  examples  which  I
wanted to mention. However, the  vandalising  of  street  taps  and  illegal
connections are also matters which are of great concern to  us.  It  becomes
more disturbing when certain political parties, like the UDM  and  the  PAC,
advocate for illegal connections and reconnections. One just leaves  to  the
imagination what chaos and anarchy will ensue should such  parties  come  to
power and into government. [Interjections.]

We need, as members of this august House, to educate our  communities  about
the negative impact this has  on  the  stable  and  efficient  provision  of
water. We are also calling on the responsible authorities  to  take  drastic
measures regarding these illegal connections. Of course, farmers who  exceed
their quotas and construct unauthorised weirs and dams should also be  dealt
with severely.

We also need to look into how far we have moved in terms of  transformation,
more especially in our regional offices.  It  is  very  disturbing  that  in
certain regional offices there are still  elements  of  racism.  I  want  to
mention one example of a regional office where a white official came to  the
office with a pet dog, and called that  dog,  using  the  name  of  a  black
official.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: He loved the dog, man.

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: We must also look into  other  areas  of  corruption  and
nepotism. I must say that I did not expect such a comment from  the  hon  Mr
Van Niekerk.

There is also a need for  a  change  of  attitudes.  People  must  focus  on
service delivery in the spirit of Batho Pele. We also  need  to  convey  our
concern in terms of the minimal representation of rural people on the  water
boards. I think the role of district councils and  municipalities  has  been
covered by our speaker from the Cacadu district council. We greatly  welcome
the vigorous drive for the eradication of the racist  bucket  system,  which
was only meant for black people. I do not know who said  that  black  people
could not use waterborne toilets, because one does not have to go to  school
to learn to flush a toilet.

May I conclude by  joining  the  hon  the  Minister  in  congratulating  the
Nhlungwana village community, not only on winning the  award,  but  also  on
ensuring the water supply to  their  community.  They  have  proved  to  the
letter the words of the hon the President: ``No one, and no one can  do  for
us what we should do ourselves.'' Vukuzenzele! Amanzi!  [Rise  up  and  act!
Water!]

HON MEMBERS: Impilo! [Health!]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Chairperson, I  say  ``siyabonga
kakhulu'' [thank you very much] to all the hon members who have  contributed
to this very interesting debate. I would say that it has been very  positive
and fruitful.

I am delighted at the kind of support that has  been  provided  here.  I  am
very interested in the critical comments.  Nobody  would  be  able  to  say,
having  witnessed  the  debate,  that  those  who   have   contributed   are
sycophantic or simply want to support  their  parties.  We  had  across  the
board, from every party here, a very clear, solid appreciation  of  what  my
department has been delivering and the service  it  renders  to  our  people
throughout the country, jikelel'ekhaya [in  all  the  households]  in  South
Africa, and for each province.

Let me start in my attempts to  reply  by  linking  the  last  hon  member's
comments with those of the first. We noted how both  the  hon  Windvoël  and
Rev Moatshe put their finger on the question of  illegal  connections.  Both
eloquently called us and various role-players in this  country  to  task  in
terms of the need to deal with that kind of criminality,  vandalism  etc,  I
really appreciate that.

The hon Windvoël talked about the fact that tons of gold will not  keep  one
alive, but water will. As he spoke,  I  recalled  how  the  economists  were
arguing about the conundrum: Why is it  that  diamonds  or  gold,  something
that does nothing for one's state of health and will not keep one  alive  if
one is without water and food, costs so much, and yet this  resource,  which
is not infinite - amanzi [water] metsi [water] - is  so  little  valued?  We
all require it to live, but people do  not  value  it.  It  is  regarded  as
though Modimo allows it to pour out of the  clouds  and  no  one  should  be
paying.

Rev Chabaku from the Free State reminded us that we are 80%  water.  I  just
want to correct her: Human beings are 70%, chickens are 80% ...  [Laughter.]
... and frogs are 90% water, by the way. But it is the problem that we  have
to get across when we come to boreholes which run dry and the fact that  our
people are not sufficiently attuned to saving  water.  Why  do  we  have  to
build the Skuifraam Dam and another dams? I will come back to that. We  must
understand that there is a price to pay for water because,  we  cannot  live
by catching the rain that falls into buckets.

One can go and do that and then one does not have to pay anybody,  or,  like
millions of rural people and especially women, one can go and take  it  free
from the springs and the rivers and spend hours a day looking for  it.  They
do not pay. I found women doing this next to Government water  schemes  that
we had put in place, and they said to me: ``No, we have got  to  pay  a  few
rands there and we have got no money.'' They would rather use that money  to
put food on the table and go and spend  several  hours  a  day  looking  for
water, often - increasingly often - polluted.

The opening statements and the end statements were very useful. I  point  to
them as key elements to remind us what this is all  about  and  of  what  an
achievement the ability to deliver water is. There is also the  question  of
water for agriculture and irrigation to make our  nation  and  economy  grow
and so on. We came to provide free basic water, not because we do not  value
it, not because it does not have a price, but because we  understand,  as  a
caring Government, that there are people in this country who  cannot  afford
the basic requirement,  and  we  put  that  at  six  kilolitres  per  month.
Therefore, I really ask all members from all parties to help us.  We  cannot
allow  this  free  taking  of  water,  the  illegal  connections;  we   need
everybody's help. That is working together.

Let me also state, from another angle, that the points about  transformation
by the hon Windvoël are points and an issue which my whole department,  from
the Minister to the director-general, is grappling  with  all  the  time.  I
believe we are succeeding. We have done tremendous work. We  have  advanced.
It is a department that is transforming. We are well aware, all of us,  that
we live in a society where none of us can say that there are no elements  of
racism from the past.

A Government department is like a rugby team or like a prosperous suburb  or
one where there is poverty.  People  carry  the  baggage  of  the  past.  In
Government, with Batho Pele - and my department follows that  through  -  we
have our transformation programme and we do  come  down  very  hard  on  any
element of racism, any disrespect for the dignity of  people,  and  we  have
very solid programmes to counter that and to change attitudes.

Regarding the question of waterborne toilets of De Aar  raised  by  my  dear
friend the hon Sulliman, I have looked very carefully at the  De  Aar  issue
and how much it would cost if we had to bring water that is  in  the  Orange
River  from  Vanderkloof  all  the  way  to  De  Aar.  The  cost  really  is
prohibitive. It is R400 million just to lay the pipelines.

If there is no water in De Aar we must do it, but the point  is  that  there
is very good groundwater in De Aar. I have seen the studies. De  Aar  exists
on the basis of that groundwater and therefore  we  cannot  think  of  other
alternative sources. Should we use that kind of  money,  the  R400  million,
when  we  are  able  to  provide  the  resource?  Providing  an   additional
augmentation and spending that R400 million brings us back to what many  hon
members here said, including the hon Windvoël  and  again  Rev  Moatshe  who
both raised the question of people who are waiting.

Unfortunately, because we still have seven years to go, it does  mean  there
is a queue. I do not choose, and neither does my  director-general  and  the
department. Actually it comes from the provinces. The provinces are  playing
a key role in how we prioritise and how we can choose. I do have a role  and
there are many cases where I look into the  issues  and  see  that  in  some
areas there  is  an  extremely  important  reason  why  there  should  be  a
prioritisation of this place or that place.

We have to apply this in a systematic and even-handed way.  Clearly  we  are
not a country where there is bribery and corruption at  this  level,  and  I
have been to countries where I have seen  how  politicians  respond  to  the
areas that vote them in, or the areas where they have  specific  families  -
the nepotism referred to. I do not find that in our country.

Corruption in my department and government departments we deal  with.  I  am
very proud of that, but it obviously does not mean that  there  is  nothing,
and again we need the support of all hon members in  this  House,  and  they
give it to me. They come to me and tell me about particular  areas  such  as
De Aar, the eastern districts of the Northwest, as the Reverend has come  to
me. We are able to examine these issues. I do so myself,  with  the  support
of my department; investigate on  behalf  of  those  hon  members  what  the
possibilities are.

Every member of this Council of Provinces and of the National  Assembly  has
the access and that open door irrespective of party affiliation. I  look  at
our friend from Gauteng, and from the New NP. I really  want  to  thank  him
and, with everybody else, applaud him for making  the  best  speech  of  the
day. There is an advantage to wearing two hats. I can wear an  SA  Communist
Party hat, and an ANC hat, a  ministerial  hat  or  a  Middle  Eastern  hat.
[Laughter.] We can talk as the situation arises, but I  want  to  thank  the
hon member Dr Conroy for his support and the way in which  he  was  able  to
present his case, as other speakers did, from the Western Cape  and  so  on.
One cannot deal with everybody, so I want to  use  this  as  an  example  of
somebody telling us what the situation in a province is.  I  really  thought
it commendable that we had a member from Gauteng wearing his provincial  hat
and talking about his premier. I do not think that the  member  was  talking
that way because the New NP has come a little closer the  ruling  party.  Or
am I mistaken? [Interjections.] This is a good spirit and  we  saw  this  in
the debate. [Interjections.]

I know that we are running out of time, so I want to come  quickly  to  some
other very weighty and important inputs from Mrs Versfeld. Clearly it  would
not have been the same occasion if Mev Versfeld had not spoken  and  focused
on  Saldanha  and  the  Berg  River  along   with   the   hon   Kent   Durr.
[Interjections.] Sorry, is it ``Miss''? Is  it  ``mejuffrou''?.  Did  I  say
``mevrou''? Sorry. Anyway, let me talk about the option of Skuifraam  versus
the treatment of sewage as in Windhoek.

Windhoek is a very interesting case. There is nothing else they can  do  for
Windhoek. It is the only way. There is hardly any groundwater  there.  There
is no possibility of a dam. The only option  there  is  recycling.  We  have
looked at this issue. We reviewed it. It is much too expensive  in  relation
to the augmentation for a part of our  country,  namely  the  City  of  Cape
Town, which would take 80% of the water. Saldanha will receive some of  that
water too, as well as the agricultural area of the Western Cape.

We have a city here, one of the most burgeoning, dynamic,  expanding  cities
- populationwise and economywise - which has to grow.  If  we  put  off  the
building of another dam at the farm Skuifraam - we  still  have  to  find  a
name for it - there is absolutely no question that we have to build  it.  We
are looking at all the  options.  So  there  is  recycling,  which  is  very
costly. There is desalination, which  is  also  extremely  costly.  Bringing
icebergs from Antartica is incredibly costly. It is  logistically  possible,
they say.

I have been a hard taskmaster in the City  of  Cape  Town  regarding  demand
management, in its form now and previously. I said to  them  that  I  wanted
them to prove to me that they were applying very  strict  education  of  the
citizens and of the demand management programme. If they can  show  that  to
me, on that basis we can evaluate whether we need  to  build  the  dam.  All
other studies have shown that we have to, including that of my  predecessor.
They have done that and delivered the goods. I have had many a meeting  with
the councillors and the mayor of Cape Town - not the previous one. The  City
of Cape Town is the main client. It needs 80% of the water. We  have  looked
at Saldanha.

Let me just finish on the issue of Cape Town. We will cripple Cape Town;  we
will cripple the economy of the Western Cape if we fail to provide in  these
water needs of the city. That is why we have gone again, after due  process,
public hearings and environmental assessments. It is perfectly  clear  about
the need.

I will come back to Saldanha. I want to say to the hon Durr, who  has  left,
but sent me a note of apology and will certainly be reading  the  Hansard  -
his party has supported the scheme, as has the DP and the New NP - that  the
environmental assessments being done have been reviewed and accepted by  the
Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. The cost of the dam  will  be
paid for by the charges for water from the whole system.

On the  issue  of  Saldanha  and  the  conservation  issue  with  regard  to
Skuifraam, such issue is being introduced and will ensure  that  the  growth
of consumption is curbed. I have referred to the  demand  management  aspect
which was a condition for the  dam.  The  Langebaan  Road  aquifer  and  the
management of groundwater are very complex and require the  co-operation  of
all users. In terms of the National Water Act, such use will be licensed  so
that we more effectively control and prevent the overuse of boreholes.  This
is often the reason why boreholes run dry. We require alternative  measures,
which is why I have talked about Skuifraam. There are also  very  extensive,
brilliant aquifer systems in the Western Cape, stretching as far as ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  Mushwana):  Hon  Minister,  this  is
just a warning that your time is about to expire.
The MINISTER: I had forgotten about that, but I am about to end.

The exploitation of the  aquifers  is  being  investigated.  The  yield  for
Skuifraam cannot answer in all the needs of the  Western  Cape,  but  within
eight years or so we will begin to harvest the  results  of  that  extensive
aquifer,  which  the  geohydrologists  are  working  hard  at,  as   is   my
department. I will certainly look into the issue  further.  The  hon  member
raised very detailed aspects here. It is complex indeed and I  will  see  to
it that I come and investigate this together with the department. We have  a
date. I have run out of time.

Let me thank the hon councillor from Salga for his input. I am very  pleased
about the co-operation that is taking place. He raised many detailed  points
which I will be dealing with and I will respond to,  not  only  in  writing,
but in discussion terms, given the problem  of  the  time.  They  are  of  a
technical and detailed nature. It is not that  I  cannot  answer  them,  but
time has become a problem for the Chair, so I apologise to the member.

I want to thank all members for their  input.  The  department  and  I  look
forward to further co-operation with all the hon members. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                 AFFAIRS - KYOTO PROTOCOL ON CLIMATE CHANGE

Mr  A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  one  of  the  most   serious   global
environmental problems facing all of us was caused  by  all  of  us  through
human activities, namely climate change. This problem had to  be  addressed,
but in a global way, and this was done by the UN's Framework  Convention  on
Climate Change and the subsequent Kyoto protocol. South Africa ratified  the
convention as early as 1997.

Voorsitter, wanneer ons toestem tot  hierdie  Kioto-protokol,  bevestig  ons
ons verbintenis om die bedreiging van  klimaatsverandering  aan  te  spreek.
Suid-Afrika het sekere verpligtinge wat hy sal moet nakom ten  opsigte  van,
meer andere, bevordering  van  programme  en  samewerking  ten  opsigte  van
sekere wetenskaplike navorsing. Daar is geen manier  dat  'n  Suid-Afrikaner
of enigeen in die wêreld nou nog kan bakhand staan en wag  vir  'n  regering
van 'n spesifieke land om iets aan hierdie probleem te doen nie. Elkeen  van
ons het 'n verantwoordelikheid om betrokke te raak.

Suid-Afrika  het  ook  voordele  wat  voortspruit  uit   'n   internasionale
onderhandeling wat ons ekonomie  en  omgewing  direk  sal  beïnvloed.  Suid-
Afrika sal kan deel hê in  die  CDM  -  Clean  Development  Mechanism  -  se
aktiwiteite wat  aan  ontwikkelende  lande  die  potensiaal  bied  vir  meer
volhoubare ontwikkeling, toegang tot meer  beleggings  in  die  land  en  'n
versnelde beskikbaarstelling van gevorderde tegnologie.

Ons enigste bekommernis lê juis daarin dat ontwikkelde lande soos  die  VSA,
Australië en Rusland óf glad nie die ooreenkoms teken nie óf baie  traag  is
ten opsigte van die doelwitte van die ooreenkoms. Ons  besef  dat  dit  juis
die ontwikkelde lande is wat ekonomies negatief deur die  ooreenkoms  geraak
word, maar as dié grootmoondhede hulle totaal hiervan onttrek, is  daar  ook
min sprake van voordeel vir die ontwikkelende lande of die  probleem  in  sy
geheel.

Ons hoop hierdie gesprek met hierdie lande wat hulle nie ten volle  betrokke
maak by die ooreenkoms nie, sal voortduur en onderhandelinge sal  nie  ophou
om alle lande betrokke te maak nie en te kontroleer dat die ooreenkoms  deur
almal nagekom word. Suid-Afrika en  die  wêreld  het  hierdie  ingryping  so
nodig, soos wat plant, dier en mens suurstof nodig het  -  en  daarom  steun
ons dit. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson,  when  we  agree  to  this  Kyoto  protocol,  we  affirm   our
commitment to addressing the threat of  climate  change.  South  Africa  has
certain obligations which will have to be honoured in terms of, inter  alia,
promotion of programmes and co-operation with regard to  certain  scientific
research. There is no way that a South African or anyone in  the  world  can
still be begging, and waiting for a government of a specific country  to  do
something about this problem. Every  one  of  us  has  a  responsibility  to
become involved.

South  Africa  also  has  advantages   emanating   from   an   international
negotiation which will  directly  influence  our  economy  and  environment.
South Africa will be able to participate in the  activities  of  the  CDM  -
Clean  Development  Mechanism  -  which  offers  developing  countries   the
potential for more sustainable development, access to  more  investments  in
the country and an accelerated appropriation of advanced technology.

Our only concern lies precisely in that  developed  countries  such  as  the
USA, Australia and Russia either have not signed the agreement or  are  very
tardy in terms of the aims of the agreement. We realise that in fact  it  is
the developed countries that are affected  negatively  economically  by  the
agreement, but if these great powers withdraw from this in  totality,  there
would be little talk of benefit for the developing countries or the  problem
as a whole.

We hope that  this  debate  with  these  countries  that  are  not  becoming
entirely involved with the agreement will  continue  and  that  negotiations
will not stop to  get  all  countries  involved  and  to  control  that  the
agreement is honoured by everyone. South Africa and  the  world  desperately
need this intervention, as  plant,  animal  and  human  need  oxygen  -  and
therefore we support this.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, last year was the second warmest  on  record,
beaten only by 1998. The protection  of  the  Antarctic  continent  and  the
great Southern Ocean surrounding it is important, not only for  citizens  of
that continent, but also for all the citizens of the world,  as  impacts  on
Antarctica's environment could have global effects. It is the  last  of  the
world's unspoiled wildernesses. It drives the  world's  climate  and  has  a
central role in regulating the earth's  environmental  processes,  including
its atmospheric and oceanic systems, global tides and sea levels.
The preservation and wellbeing of the Antarctic region  is  therefore  vital
in determining weather patterns in Southern  Africa  and  the  rest  of  the
planet.  Antarctica's  greatest  value  might  be  the  information  it  has
provided on the functioning and health of our planet. The discovery  of  the
ozone hole above the Antarctic in 1985 alerted the world to the  potentially
dangerous changes in the environment caused by human  activities.  This  led
to the first measures being taken to control pollution and climate change.

Our only help and defence is the Kyoto  climate  treaty  and  the  place  to
watch for global warming. The sensitive point is the Arctic. If  the  planet
as a whole warms by one degree, the poles will warm by about three  degrees.
Ice now covers 15% less of the Arctic Ocean than it did  20  years  ago.  In
the 1950s it was about 10 feet thick, now it is less than  six  feet  thick.
At the current rate of melting, in 50 years the northern ocean could be ice-
free all summer, and that would be the end of polar  bears.  In  fact,  many
creatures of the  Arctic  Ocean,  not  only  polar  bears,  are  already  in
trouble.
The Arctic is changing faster  than  scientists  can  document.  Every  five
years the world's  climatologists  assess  current  knowledge  about  global
warming. It erases any doubt about where this warming  is  coming  from  and
warns that we ain't seen nothing yet. If  we  keep  spewing  out  greenhouse
gases according to pattern, we will see three  to  ten  times  more  warming
over the 21st century.

The Kyoto protocol that was agreed  to  in  Kyoto  in  1997,  after  arduous
negotiations, set out a legally binding emission reduction  target  of  5,2%
for industrial countries.

Daarom is dit  vandag  vir  my  ontstellend  om  te  besef  dat  die  groter
industriële  en  ontwikkelde  lande  soos  Amerika,  Japan  en  Australië  -
alhoewel Japan onlangs besluit het om die protokol  te  onderteken  -  hulle
onttrek het aan die ooreenkoms. Hulle meen dat dit die Amerikaners en  veral
president Bush se regte sal aantas. Mens kan  maar  net  dink  watter  regte
mens sal hê as daar geen lewende wesens op die aarde oor is nie. Vir ons  in
die DA is dit van absolute belang dat ons hierdie Kyoto  Protocol  steun  en
daarom  doen  ons  dit.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[That is why today  I  find  it  disturbing  to  realise  that  the  greater
industrial and developed countries  like  America,  Japan  and  Australia  -
although Japan decided recently to sign the protocol - have  withdrawn  from
the agreement. They are of the opinion  that  it  would  infringe  upon  the
rights of the Americans, and especially those of  President  Bush.  One  can
only wonder what kind of rights  one  will  have  if  there  are  no  living
creatures left on earth. For us in the DA it is  of  the  utmost  importance
that we support this Kyoto Protocol, and  that  is  why  we  are  doing  so.
[Applause.]]

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson, let me in a second say that changes  in  our
climate as a result of human activity pose a  serious  threat  to  humanity.
Human beings are causing the release of carbon dioxide and other  greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere at rates much  faster  than  those  at  which  the
earth can recycle them.

Whilst  the  concentrations  of  almost  all  greenhouse  gases  have   been
increasing since the Industrial  Revolution,  carbon  dioxide  has  had  the
greatest effect on changing the  climate.  During  the  1980s  human  beings
released more than 5 billion tons of  carbon  dioxide  into  the  atmosphere
annually by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil  and  natural  gases  for
heat, transportation and electricity.

The question may be: Why should we worry  about  this?  It  is  because  the
greenhouse gases we emit today remain in  our  atmosphere  for  decades  and
centuries. These emissions will  increase  even  more  dramatically  as  the
developing world moves towards greater industrialisation.  Greenhouse  gases
act like an insulator or blanket above  the  earth,  keeping  the  heat  in.
Increasing the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere increases  the
atmosphere's ability to block the escape of heat, which,  in  turn,  further
warms the surface of the earth. If this situation  is  allowed  to  continue
unchecked, it will affect climate  changes  well  into  the  future  of  our
children and grandchildren.

One of the greatest concerns of  those  who  are  trying  to  reduce  global
warming is its negative effect on sea levels. A continuing increase  in  the
earth's temperature may result in the melting of icecaps,  which,  in  turn,
may lead to rising sea levels, which could put millions of  people  at  risk
of floods.

A lot of discussions have taken place over the  impact  of  global  warming.
Some developed countries even went so far as disputing the negative  effects
of global warming and refusing to  sign  the  protocol.  Examples  of  those
countries have already been mentioned. They include America  and  Australia,
although they have withdrawn.

These greenhouse sceptics, as I call them,  are  merely  trying  to  protect
their own interests. Just like the tobacco companies that knew  the  reality
of the addictive nature of nicotine and its link with cancer, but  tried  to
conceal it through extensive campaigns, energy companies are also trying  to
discredit the link between greenhouse gases and global warming.
The oil, coal, gas and mining industries stand to lose tremendously  if  the
truth about global warming becomes globally accepted.  South  Africa  and  a
growing number of African countries have accepted  the  truth  about  global
warming. We have decided to accede to this protocol despite  the  fact  that
greenhouse emissions from  Africa  herself  are  practically  negligible  in
global  terms  due  to  the  continent's  low  level  of   development   and
industrialisation.

The entire continent is estimated to be responsible for less than 7% of  the
global emission of such gases.  Although  some  people  may  not  know  that
Africa has taken the lead in implementing development programmes  that  will
react to global environmental problems,  particularly  climate  change,  the
smaller off-grid application of renewable  generated  electricity  has  been
widely demonstrated in various regions in Africa.

Approximately 100000  small-scale  solar  PV  systems  have  been  installed
throughout the region for various purposes. Ethanol  production  from  local
biomass has been developed within sugarcane industries in  Southern  Africa.
In this case, Mali and Zimbabwe - some may  think  that  Zimbabwe  does  not
come forward with good things - are among countries experimenting  with  the
use of multipurpose lower-input biomass feed stocks for  the  production  of
diesel substitutes. These examples show  that  Africa  has  firmly  put  the
issue of climate change within the broader context of  African  development.
In terms of the advantages that will accrue to our own country as  a  result
of the accession, South Africa  will  be  able  to  influence  international
negotiations to her own advantage and that of the SADC region.  Economically
we will also be able to seize opportunities.

In  conclusion,  the  ANC  supports  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]
