                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the Democratic Party:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Democratic Party has received confirmation from Marine
       and Coastal Management (MCM) that the Rights Verification Unit  (RVU)
       did  not  verify  quota  applications  to  the  extent  that  it  was
       advertised and published,  and  that  the  enormous  amount  of  R4,3
       million was spent on the setting up  of  the  application  forms  and
       database for intensive verifications in future;


  (2) takes cognisance of the fact that the DP has noted with concern  that
       -


       (a)  verification has effectively come to  a  halt  although  it  was
           promised that the verification process would last  the  term  of
           the quota rights;


       (b)  real verification will only start in about two months' time; and


       (c)  many communities and companies  were  prejudiced  because  their
           documentation was not verified properly and  consequently  their
           applications and appeals were rejected; and


  (3) further notes that because of the devastating impoverishing effect of
       the  high  quota  application,  coupled  with  the  removal  of   the
       subsistence right of these communities and companies, the DP calls on
       the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism -


       (a)  to verify and re-evaluate all applications and appeals; and


       (b)  to set up a list of  deserving  companies  in  their  respective
           demarcated areas, as well as a list of the various species.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the African National Congress Women's League organised  a  rally
           of local women and women  refugees  from  the  DRC,  Angola  and
           Mozambique, on Sunday, 18 August 2002; and


       (b)  this rally highlighted the human rights  abuse  of  refugees  in
           general and women refugees in particular in our communities;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the abuse of the rights of refugees is  a  manifestation  of  an
           endemic problem of racism, xenophobia and  related  intolerances
           in our communities; and


       (b)  this rally represents a conscious attempt  to  build  solidarity
           amongst African  people,  and  women  in  particular,  to  fight
           xenophobia;


  (3) commends the Women's League in the Western Cape for embarking on this
       initiative; and


  (4) calls on community organisations, church groups and labour unions  to
       emulate this shining example and  to  fight  xenophobia,  racism  and
       related intolerances.

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its concern at the rising political instability between ANC
       and IFP supporters in Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) notes with astonishment the shooting  of  the  daughter  of  the  ANC
       member, widow Phumzile Zitha, and the bombing of her homestead  where
       she lost everything she possessed in the house;


  (3) expresses its shock and horror at the  killings  of  the  ANC  branch
       secretary Zama Mkhonza and ANC members  Mqwayi  Qwabe  and  Khulekani
       Mthembu in Nongoma;


  (4) notes that these occurred in the months of July and August;


  (5) extends its heartfelt sympathy and condolences to  the  families  and
       friends of these comrades;


  (6) further notes that this instability is escalating in the province and
       that innocent people are dying every day;


  (7)  appreciates  the  manner  in  which  the  police  have  handled  the
       situation, in particular Senior Superintendent Zondo  and  his  unit,
       who with their quick response ensured that two arrests were made;


  (8) calls for unity amongst our people; and


  (9) further calls for the ANC and IFP to -


       (a)  resolve their differences in order to  bring  an  end  to  these
           senseless and merciless killing of our people; and


       (b)  assist in doing away with criminals who commit gruesome criminal
           acts while hiding behind their political banners.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf  of
the ANC at the next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a white woman business entrepreneur  and  an  ANC  activist,  Ms
           Wanda Stoffberg, was physically and verbally abused by  a  group
           of  white  right-wingers  for  having  black  customers  in  her
           butchery in George; and


       (b)  the Democratic Alliance-controlled municipality  of  George  has
           now instructed her to close down her butchery;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the actions of the DA-controlled municipality of  George  served
           to fuel racial tensions and  divisions  amongst  the  people  of
           George; and


       (b)  in so doing, undermined the efforts of our Government and people
           to build national unity; and


  (3) calls on -


       (a)  the police to expedite investigation of this case and  to  bring
           the perpetrators to book; and


       (b)  the DA to desist from actions  that  fuels  tension  and  racial
           divisions amongst the people.
                     ATTACKS ON FREE STATE FARM DWELLERS


                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek stel hiermee sonder kennis voor:  [Chairperson,
I move without notice:]


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that -


       (a)  a wave of senseless, cruel attacks  on  defenceless  people  has
              occurred during the past few weeks in the rural parts  of  the
              Free State, namely Zastron, Smithfield, Ficksburg  and  Reitz,
              and that the New NP wishes to express  its  concern  regarding
              this;


       (b)  exceptionally good  relations  exist  between  farm  owners  and
              farmworkers and that they come to one another's aid  in  times
              of need;


       (c)  the SA  Police  Service  deserves  praise  for  their  efficient
              response, which in most cases leads to the  prompt  arrest  of
              criminals; and


       (d)  something should be done drastically  to  bring  criminals,  who
              have no  feeling  for  human  life  and  are  apparently  not
              deterred by imprisonment, to their senses; and


  (2) expresses its sincere sympathy to the next of kin of the victims  and
       to the farmowners and workers who survived these barbaric attacks.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      MACHAKOS PROTOCOL SIGNED IN SUDAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the Machakos Protocol signed in July between the government  of
       the Republic of Sudan and the Sudan  Peoples'  Liberation  Army/Sudan
       Peoples' Liberation Movement in an  attempt  to  end  the  civil  war
       between the Muslim north and the Christian and animist  South  Sudan,
       which has been raging for over 20  years  and  during  which  over  1
       million people were killed or maimed; and


  (2) calls upon the South African Government to  help  and  encourage  the
       warring parties in Sudan to  adhere  to  the  agreement  and  to  the
       process towards peace,  constitutional  government  and  respect  for
       human rights that the agreement spells out, including  the  right  to
       self-determination for the people of South Sudan.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       EXPORT CREDIT AND FOREIGN INVESTMENTS INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL

      (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee thereon)

The MINISTER OF  TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  it  is  a  very  smart
machine. It turns on by itself. It is excellent.  Could  I  also  thank  the
NCOP and the committees very sincerely  for  expediting  this  amendment.  I
know it was relatively difficult for them, but I would like  to  thank  them
for doing it.

The export credit insurance  corporation  as  members  know  was  introduced
relatively recently starting in 2001. Most of the members I think  are  also
familiar with the fact that this was previously a function that was  carried
out by a private sector structure in partnership with Government. But for  a
range of reasons that were consulted  on  widely,  we  established  the  new
export credit insurance corporation.

Very briefly, and I think hon member Mohseen will go into more detail,  this
is a function that reinsures or ensures exports and capital goods  projects.
Those are construction projects, engineering  projects  and  other  projects
that takes place outside of South  Africa.  Accordingly,  it  plays  a  very
important role in the ability of South African companies both to export  and
to undertake projects in other countries and other countries in Africa.

What we found after operating the new Act for a  period  of  time  was  that
there was some degree of uncertainty around the precise  levels  that  would
be ensured. That has always been our intention and it  is  our  practice  to
ensure 90% of the project. But  it  was  argued  by  certain  of  the  legal
advisers in the financial sector that the Bill could be interpreted to  mean
that it was 90% of what was previously ensured  which  was  90%  that  would
have been 81%. And it was felt advisable that we clarify this, we could  not
have that kind of uncertainty in the Act. We also  felt  that  in  order  to
establish the legal  basis  for  these  contracts,  because  they  are  long
contracts generally speaking, that that certainty should  be  provided  from
the time of operation of the export credit insurance corporation.

So the purpose here  is  to  provide  absolute  certainty  for  the  current
operations of the export credit insurance corporation. The other  amendments
are relatively technical in nature and are designed  to  clean  up  the  Act
where we picked up that in the movement from the  old  to  the  new  certain
terms had not been changed. Certainly it  was  not  like  much  of  the  old
legislation gender sensitive. And it was also felt  that  the  role  of  the
Minister needed to be very precisely stated. Since  the  previous  structure
was a partnership between public  and  private  the  Ministers  had  certain
powers. It could have been interpreted that the Minister would have to  deal
with each and every one of the very numerous applications and  that  is  not
the intention of the Act. The Minister  deals  with  certain  defined  areas
that are now I think set out more clearly in the legislation.

Very briefly, the reason for the request to the Chair to process  this  Bill
quickly was to allow us to proceed with a number of  major  projects  in  an
atmosphere of complete certainty. And this is why our  target  has  been  to
try and get the Bill through by the end of this month. This  coincides  with
the dates of some of the larger projects and the closure of  some  of  these
larger projects.

Chairperson and members, once again my thanks for  moving  to  process  this
Bill. I am sure members are familiar with the quite large amounts  of  money
involved.  We  are  currently  looking  at  the  export   credit   insurance
corporation  that  has  approved  32  projects  in  28  countries  on   five
continents  to  the  value  of  R7,5  billion.  We  are  looking   at   very
significant, large amounts of money and  it  is  for  us  a  very  important
agency. We are one of a group of about 15  to  20  of  these  export  credit
insurance corporations  that  are  members  of  Berne  Union,  which  is  an
international agency that brings the credit agencies together and is a  very
competitive arena I must tell members. Everyone seeks  this  business.  From
our point of view, as an exporter of manufactured products, as  a  developer
of major industrial projects, we need to be within this  competitive  domain
and the export credit insurance corporation is designed to do that.

I have tried, in the interest of the programme, to take much less  than  the
15 minutes allowed. I am hoping that you would allow me to bank what I  have
saved now with the export credit insurance corporation  for  a  later  time.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson I would  like  to  take  the  precedent  that  the
Minister has set, except that I  am  not  in  charge  of  an  export  credit
agency, so I do not have a bank in which to put my minutes. But,  thank  you
very much hon Minister for those kind words  to  the  committee.  I  thought
that what is important for us to do is to explain  very  briefly  how  these
things work, because I think a  lot  of  people  see  these  things  in  the
newspapers and things, and it is important for  us  who  are  passing  these
laws, who are  making  these  amendments,  to  understand  what  kind  of  a
transaction is taking place here.

Now, for example, if we look at the Mozal project, it  involves  very  large
sums of money, much more than the $250 million being lent to  Mozal  through
the export credit agency project. A whole lot of financiers  from  all  over
have come together and have taken bits and pieces of the Mozal  project  and
have funded this project. Each one of those people who put  money  into  the
project wants to make sure that the risk that they embark upon in  investing
this money in the Mozal-type project is safe. In the same way, for  example,
if one of us were to go to a bank to lend money to buy a house  or  start  a
business. The bank would say: Where is  your  collateral?  They  would  say:
Tata Kgware, where is your collateral? Because we do not lend you  money  to
start a business if you do not have the collateral.

Well, with these big projects, when you go to banks and you say to them:  We
need $250 million - that is more than R2,5  billion-  to  invest  in  Mozal,
they ask the same question. They say to you: Where is your collateral?  Now,
in an instance like that Government has to play a role. For  a  bank  to  be
able to put its money into Mozal, Government has to be the  collateral.  And
in  the  Southern  African  region  the  government  that  is  usually   the
collateral is the  South  African  Government.  Of  course,  the  Mozambican
government and other governments do provide  this  kind  of  sovereign  risk
management, but the South African Government more often than not  takes  the
risk and provides this collateral. And  what  the  export  credit  guarantee
agency does is, it facilitates this process in  terms  of  which  Government
takes the risk.

Now, when this Mozal project was started and negotiations were taking  place
there were things  that  foreign  bankers  were  worried  about.  They  were
saying: If we put our $250 million into  the  Mozal  project,  we  have  two
concerns: Firstly, we want to be clear that the South African Government  is
taking the sovereign risk, and we are not so sure if  we  look  at  the  Act
that this is, in fact, the case - the Minister dealt with that.  There  were
certain clauses in the Bill that required that the  Minister  must  look  at
the terms and conditions of every single contract when this kind of risk  is
taken by Government. And, of course, Ministers do not work  like  that,  not
in this country, and nowhere in the world.

What Government usually does to an agency like the export credit  agency  is
that Government gives a broad  mandate,  and  Government  will  say  to  the
export credit agency: We give you the broad mandate to go  out  and  provide
the export credit guarantees on behalf  of  Government.  But,  the  Minister
does not look at every term and every bit of detail, and what these  bankers
from overseas will  say  is:  Well,  if  the  Minister  has  not  looked  at
everything, then someone could come at a later  stage  and  take  the  whole
matter to court and say that the Minister did not apply his  mind,  and,  of
course, then the collateral is in  jeopardy  -  the  sovereign  risk  is  no
longer there. They wanted us  to  clear  this  thing  up.  So,  one  of  the
amendments we had to  bring  about  is  an  amendment  that  said  that  the
Minister would give one broad mandate  to  the  export  credit  and  foreign
guarantee agency - that is the full name.  Of  course,  after  the  Minister
gives that mandate the agency has the power to do the honourable  one-on-one
deals and day-to-day business; they have a broad mandate to do that. We  had
to clear that up, it was very important.

It is a standard thing all over the world that governments  give  this  kind
of broad mandate to agencies. It is a very serious  mandate  for  Parliament
to understand, because we are putting Government  at  risk.  If  Mozal  goes
down we are going to be in debt, as Government, for R2,5  billion.  That  is
what this means. In other words, we, in some way or  another,  are  bringing
liabilities onto the  taxpayer,  the  South  African  taxpayer,  because  if
something happens to Mozal, of course, the South  African  taxpayer  has  to
fork out. But this is the case in all the contracts. The Minister  mentioned
that there are 32 contracts all over the world. There are some in Qatar,  in
Doha and South America, and all sorts of places there - it totals about  R35
billion. We, as taxpayers in this  country,  are  the  guarantors  for  that
money and if those projects do not happen we, as  taxpayers,  will  have  to
fork out and take the risk that the banks took. So, that is  the  one  thing
that was needed do be done with regard to this Bill.

The second issue was, if we do provide a guarantee, how much of a  guarantee
do we provide? If Mozal says that they want to lend  R1  billion,  are  they
allowed to lend all of the R1 billion, or will we be taking  collateral  for
that full R1 billion, or will we be taking  collateral  for  less?  The  law
says that we will only provide a guarantee for 90% of that. In other  words,
if R1 billion is being borrowed by any of these  projects,  Government  will
only take the risk for 90% of that. When Government goes out  and  gets  the
money in and the premium structures are worked out,  those  people  who  put
money into the processes must also take some risk - this was the old  law  -
and, in terms of that, there would be a nine percent  risk  that  they  will
take as well. This was an innovative thing in our old  law,  but  the  banks
who came to the party on Mozal were very unhappy about that, and  they  said
that they are not prepared to take any risk at  all.  As  far  as  they  are
concerned we must divide political risk from commercial risk.  Where  it  is
political risk they want 100% sovereign risk  to  be  taken  by  Government.
Where there is commercial risk they are prepared to talk about it.

And so, at the end of the day, we had to even change that clause  to  ensure
that when we do take sovereign risk  as  the  state  we  take  100%  of  the
sovereign risk, in other words,  100%  of  the  90%  of  the  risk,  if  you
understand what I am saying. We had to do this, it is not very fair - it  is
not very just, actually - because if banks are going to earn  premiums  when
they put money down, and they are all  making  money  here  -  everybody  is
making money here - they should be prepared  to  take  some  risk.  But,  of
course, because it is a political  risk,  because  it  is  Southern  Africa,
because we may need them more than they need  us,  because  we  have  Nepad,
because we have infrastructural needs, I think, we  had  to  back  down  and
say: Look, you know, we will allow this for  now.  We  will  take  the  risk
because we believe in our region, we believe in our country, we  believe  in
our subregion, and we are prepared to take this risk. But  it  is  a  little
bit unfair because if they make money out of it they  should  take  some  of
the risk. So, in any case, that is one of the amendments that we  accept  as
well.

The third amendment that came about was an amendment which required that  we
make this law retrospective to July 2001. Now, as my  hon  colleagues  would
know, that is a serious thing. We are passing a law  today  that  came  into
effect a year before. You remember this law, I  am  sure  many  of  the  ANC
people remember this law. In the days of apartheid  when  Government  wanted
to nail you on something they would pass a law today, but make it  effective
from five years ago or last year. Then if  you  were  doing  something  last
week - at the time it was not a crime - but today after they pass  the  law,
suddenly, it is a crime. So, it becomes a crime after you do  it.  And  that
is how the old regime used to get around the rule of law. As  you  know  the
ANC Government never liked retrospective laws. Fortunately  these  days  ...
[Interjections.]

Sandra is again lost, as usual she is lost in these discussions. We  do  not
like retrospective law, and, I think, everybody knows that. We do  not  like
to make laws today ... [Interjections.] Retrospective is the right word.  We
do not like these things, because what they do is they  bring  the  rule  of
law into question. It means it is a government that can do anything.

But in some instances it is very legitimate. This time around we had a  very
long discussion, hon Minister, with your  advisers  at  the  department  and
also with the banks, and we wanted to send out a clear  message  that  says:
This is not something we do every day. It is a very extraordinary  thing  we
are doing, and we really want to understand why we need this.  And  we  were
convinced, as a select committee, after all the discussions we had with  the
advisers, that  it  was,  in  fact,  necessary  for  us  to  make  this  law
retrospective because what that would do is it  would  allow  for  the  nine
contracts that were signed from July last year to also be  treated  in  this
way. And if we allow them to be treated in this way we will make  sure  that
nobody loses out if any of those matters go to court, because of  the  terms
and conditions and the way that they  may  have  been  structured  in  those
agreements.

We do not want a situation where somebody  can  challenge  or  attack  those
agreements because in some of them a lot of money is involved - billions  of
rands - and we did not want anybody to suffer prejudice. We do not want  the
banks to suffer prejudice. What convinced us most about  the  fact  that  it
was necessary to make this law retrospective  was  that  the  export  credit
guarantee agency and the banks had, in fact, already agreed to these  terms.
So, the fact that we are making it retrospective  just  solidifies  it.  The
parties that were involved in these nine transactions before this  -  up  to
July 2001 - had already been working on the basis of the  law  that  we  are
passing and we decided that if we do pass the law we are  not  really  going
to be causing much of a  problem.  On  that  basis  we  agreed  to  all  the
amendments that have been recommended by the  department.  Deputy  Chair,  I
think that the Bill certainly improves the original  Bill  and  the  way  in
which the export credit agency works. It certainly allows the agency  to  be
able to do more rigorously and in a more flexible way what it does on a day-
to-day basis. I want to call on this honourable House to support  the  Bill.
Thank you very much.

Debate concluded.

Declarations of vote:

Mr L G LEVER: These amendments ... [Inaudible.] ... and  service  providers,
the support they need to  export  their  goods  and  services.  It  is  also
further necessary to allow the large  capital  projects  to  go  forward  to
enable the development of our region and the integration  of  the  economies
in the region, which is necessary to support the objectives  of  Nepad.  For
these reasons the DA supports this Bill. Thank you, Chair.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Can I make the  correction?  It  is  the
Democratic Party, not the DA. Mr Durr.
Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, every deal, of course, ends in the bank and one  of
the things this Bill does is  to  roll  the  contingent  liability  off  the
balance sheet of the bank and onto the balance sheet  of  the  insurer,  and
therefore, obviates notes on the balance sheet of the  private  company  and
allows them to observe prudential limits as far as developing countries  are
concerned and often then also allows them to be  in  conformity  with  rules
which may be laid down for them by their central bank.

So it gives the financial community and the  project  community  in  general
much greater  flexibility.  That  is  the  main  point,  actually,  of  this
legislation. It is very  important;  we  think  it  is  very  necessary.  We
understand the need for clarity  and  certainty.  We  support  it.  However,
Minister, in supporting the Bill we would like to say that  co-insurance  is
the way that we have to be going because there is no way that the  objective
of Nepad  will  be  met  by  the  resources  that  even  the  South  African
Government can apply.

Therefore, we have to bring other people to the party, and we have to  bring
them to the party soon because if we bring them to the  party  once  we  are
already very deep in ourselves,  we  become  less  attractive  to  co-insure
with. Co-insurance is vital, and particularly with the private  market.  Our
hon chairman of our committee spoke very well today and he spoke  about  the
role of Government - he did not mention the role  of  the  private  insurers
and the trend is to go private. Many of these big companies in Bermuda  that
do this kind of business - Warren Buffet's companies, ACE in Bermuda, I  can
name many others - co-operate  with  national  agencies  on  a  co-insurance
basis. Also MIGA, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency of the  World
Bank - we should also be seeking to co-insure with  them,  so  that  we  get
more bank for our buck, so that  the  Minister,  who  often  uses  the  word
leverage, can leverage-up our capacity to  do  more  by  doing  things  more
together, and strengthening the deal in the process by  doing  it  that  way
and attracting other people. Because as soon  as  we  take  the  lead  risk,
then, of course, the whole thing becomes much more  possible  for  everybody
to enter, because they know we have leverage over the insured.

So, with those few words, Minister, may I ask you to please attend  to  that
if you have not already. The whole question of  co-insurance,  I  think,  is
vital, and it is vital that we get in early, and we get in  with  a  private
market and with the national insurers and with MIGA, so that we can  get  as
much mileage out of this agency as possible,  because  otherwise  ...  [Time

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, this Bill is aimed  at  more  clearly  defining
certain expressions in the Export Credit and  Foreign  Investment  Insurance
Act and to abolish certain definitions.  The  amendments  are  technical  in
nature, but essential to ensure the moother  operation  of  the  export  and
insurance activities to  which  this  Act  relates,  and  do  not  pose  any
financial implications to the state. The New NP supports the amending  Bill.
Thank you. [Applause.]]

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONEMTAL
       AFFAIRS - STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon Chairperson, hon  members,  hon  special  delegates  from
provinces, ladies and gentlemen, and the House at large, it is perhaps  more
than fitting that we have  the  Stockholm  Convention  before  this  revered
House today.

As I speak, delegates and heads of state from around the globe are  arriving
in  our  country  in  their  thousands  to  attend  and  be  part   of   the
deliberations that will take  place  at  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development in Johannesburg four days from today.

It  is  our  conviction  that  the  resolutions  adopted  at  the  Stockholm
Convention are inextricably linked to  some  of  the  issues  that  will  be
deliberated  upon  at  the  Summit.  As  some  of  us  would  know,  the  UN
Environment Programme initiated a process in  1997  to  develop  a  globally
legally-binding instrument to reduce the  risks  to  human  health  and  the
environment costs by the release and  long  range  transport  of  persistent
organic pollutants.

The persistent organic pollutants convention is aimed at either  eliminating
or reducing the production or release of the first 12 identified  persistent
organic pollutants via an  international  convention,  and  also  identifies
other POP candidates.

Given South Africa's nonparticipation and isolation from  this  and  similar
important international conventions because of  its  apartheid  history,  we
have  through  the  Department  of   Environmental   Affairs   and   Tourism
participated in the negotiations for the POPs convention.

We have also attended  the  conference  of  plenipotentiaries  of  the  POPs
convention in Stockholm in May 2001 which finally  adopted  the  convention.
Our country signed this  convention  at  this  meeting.  The  Department  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism will be the lead agent responsible for co-
ordinating  the  implementation  of  the  persistent   organics   pollutants
convention.

We are estimating that South Africa's contribution based on past  experience
with other conventions will be in the range  of  $30 000  annually  to  this
convention. The calculations of the contributions  of  individual  countries
to the convention are normally based on the country's assessed  contribution
as per the UN scale.

The essence of the convention which  all  the  parties  recognised  is  that
persistent organic pollutants possess toxic properties, resist  degradation,
bio-accumulate,  and  are  transported  through  air,  water  and  migratory
species across international boundaries and deposited from  their  place  of
release  where  they  accumulate  in  terrestrial  and  aquatic  ecosystems.
Moreover, its destructive effects extend to health because of  exposure  of,
especially women, and through them to  future  generations.  Its  impact  is
also particularly felt in developing countries  and  indigenous  communities
because of the contamination of their water supply and traditional foods.

The convention is also mindful of the efficacy and  efficiency  of  possible
control  measures  in  meeting  reduction  goals.  It  therefore  prescribed
specific technical feasibility studies. Moreover,  it  is  clear  about  the
positive and negative impacts on  society's  implementing  possible  control
measures in the following spheres: Health, including  public,  environmental
and occupational health; agriculture, including aqua-culture  and  forestry;
bio-diversity; economic aspects; movement towards  sustainable  development;
and social costs.

As a country we are proud to have signed the  Stockholm  Convention  because
its  core  is  about  the  relationship  between  human  society   and   its
environment. The select committee unanimously  agreed  to  this  convention.
Therefore we place it before this hon House to accept it. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! That  concludes
the debate. I shall now put the question  and  it  is  that  the  report  be

provinces voted in favour. I therefore declare the report adopted  in  terms
of section 65 of the Constitution. [Applause.]

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   AFFAIRS - ROTTERDAM CONVENTIONON ON PIC PROCEDURE FOR CERTAIN HAZARDOUS
               CHEMICALS AND PESTICIDES IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

Mr  V  V  Z  WINDVOëL:  Mgcinisihlalo,  malunga  eMkhandlu   lahloniphekile,
netivakashi tetfu  lapha  etulu,  ngiyabonga  kutfola  lelitfuba  lekwetfula
lombiko. [Chairperson, hon members  of  this  House,  our  visitors  in  the
gallery, I am happy to have this opportunity to present this report  to  the
House.]

Let me start by apologising for the mishap. I usually keep  my  credit  card
safe so I had to take this one back to my wallet. In March 1998,  after  two
years of extensive  negotiations,  95  countries,  including  South  Africa,
finalised the  text  of  the  Rotterdam  Convention  on  the  prior-informed
consent  procedure  for  certain  hazardous  chemicals  and  pesticides   in
international trade. The text of the convention was adopted and  opened  for
signature at a diplomatic conference in Rotterdam in September  1998.  South
Africa did not sign the convention then.

This  convention  represents  an  important  step   towards   ensuring   the
protection of cities and the environment in all countries from the  possible
harm resulting from trade in highly dangerous pesticides and  chemicals.  It
will save lives and protect the environment  from  the  adverse  effects  of
pesticides and toxic chemicals. It will establish a first  line  of  defence
against  future  tragedies  by  preventing  unwanted  imports  of  dangerous
chemicals, particularly in the developing countries.  By  extending  to  all
countries the ability to protect  themselves  against  the  risks  of  toxic
substances, it will have levelled  the  playing  fields  and  raised  global
standards for protection of human health and the environment.

In short, the convention will enable the world to monitor  and  control  the
trade in very dangerous substances. It will  give  important  countries  the
power to decide which chemicals they want to receive and  to  exclude  those
they cannot manage safely.  If  trade  does  take  place,  requirements  for
labelling  and  provision   of   information   on   potential   health   and
environmental effects will promote the safe use of these chemicals.

We need this convention, because every year thousands of people die  or  are
seriously poisoned by toxic pesticides and other chemicals. Many  of  theses
substances  also  cause  devastating  problems  when   released   into   the
environment where they may poison water resources, animal  and  plant  life,
and also people. Unwanted and obsolete stockpiles  of  such  pesticides  and
toxic chemicals have accumulated  in  virtually  every  developing  country.
Many of these chemicals are  persistent  organic  pollutants.  Highly  toxic
chemicals  that  persist  in  an  environment  for  long  periods  of   time
accumulate in wildlife and  people  that  are  mobile  in  the  environment,
possibly travelling thousands of kilometres from where they were released.

The  convention  will  help  solve   these   pressing   human   health   and
environmental problems by reducing the use of chemicals to  where  they  are
absolutely necessary and can be safely used. In this manner  the  convention
will help to prevent the new chemicals safety problem.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  That  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question and the question is that the report  be
adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I have ascertained that delegation heads are  present  and  in
accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces  the  opportunity  to
make a declaration of vote, if they so wish. Any province? I take  it  there
is none. We shall now proceed to the voting on  the  question.  I  shall  do
this in alphabetical order this time per  province.  Delegation  heads  must
please indicate to the Chair whether they vote  in  favour,  or  against  or
abstain from voting.

The Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Sihambisana nayo. [We vote in favour.]

Ms M P THEMBA: We vote in favour.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Northern Cape?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Western Cape?

Mr C ACKERMANN: We vote in favour.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  All  nine  provinces
voted in favour. I, therefore, declare  the  report  adopted  in  accordance
with section 65 of the Constitution.

      THE PROMOTION OF NEPAD WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE WORLD SUMMIT ON
                           SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Chairperson it is indeed a  great  pleasure  to
introduce this very important topic that we are discussing this afternoon.

It is useful to begin by reflecting on what sustainable development  is.  In
a report of the World Commission on Environment and Development in  1987  it
was put as ``development  that  meets  the  needs  of  the  present  without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet  their  own  needs''.
Sustainable development, therefore, is development for humanity's survival.

Ten years ago in Rio  the  UN  Conference  on  Environment  and  Development
committed itself to the principle of sustainable development as a  blueprint
for  policies  that  would  direct  the  social  and  economic  progress  of
humanity. This meeting came to be  called  the  Earth  Summit.  The  meeting
adopted the Rio Declaration - or, famously, Agenda 21 -  and  the  Statement
of Principles for the Sustainable Management of  Forests,  as  well  as  two
legally binding conventions, namely the UN Framework Convention  on  Climate
Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

These agreements integrated the protection of the environment with  economic
and social issues. They were intended to be a central part  of  the  policy-
making  process.  Agenda  21,  therefore,  the  blueprint  for   sustainable
development, offered a common vision for  growth,  equity  and  conservation
over the long term.

Today we stand at Rio plus 10. What has  been  achieved?  Implementation  of
Agenda 21 was largely dependent on support from the developed  countries  of
the North. Support in terms of resources ... [Inaudible.] [Interjections.]

The microphone appears to have a mind of its own,  Chairperson,  because  it
keeps moving.

An HON MEMBER: It is sabotaging you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: It is sabotaging  the  Western  Cape,  yes.  My
Whip will protect me. [Laughter.]

A cursory reading  of  the  report  on  Agenda  21  clearly  indicates  that
developed countries have dragged their feet on their Rio commitments. It  is
clear they have not fulfilled the promises made at Rio,  either  to  protect
their own environments or to  help  the  developing  world  defeat  poverty.
Unfortunately, as we look beyond Agenda 21, the  harmful  practices  of  the
capitalist North have continued to degrade  the  world's  natural  resources
and to further disadvantage the South. We know that the ongoing  destruction
of forests  and  land  poses  a  threat  both  to  those  who  have  already
benefited, as well as to the vast majority of the peoples of the  world  who
continue to live in abject poverty.

The UN World Summit in Johannesburg has  been  convened  in  order  to  seek
implementable  responses  to   the   ongoing   challenges   of   sustainable
development. In particular, the summit must determine the  manner  in  which
developing countries will be supported in eradicating poverty,  in  adopting
practicable  environmental  protection  policies  and  in   preventing   the
developed North from its continued exploitation of the natural resources  of
the South. The summit will focus on five core  areas  that  are  central  to
ensuring sustainable development.

The first area is  water  and  sanitation.  More  than  one  billion  people
currently live without safe  drinking  water  and  twice  that  number  live
without adequate sanitation. More than three million people die  every  year
from diseases carried in unsafe water. We have, here in South  Africa,  made
water a priority for development. Since 1994 water has been extended to  ten
million of the poorest and we have plans to eliminate the apartheid  backlog
of access to water by 2008. Basic sanitation has been provided  to  400  000
of the poorest South Africans.

The second area of focus at the World Summit is the area of energy.  Without
energy there can be no  development,  yet  today  two  billion  people  live
without access to sources of sustainable energy. While the world's  poor  go
without energy, there is an obscene overconsumption in the developed  world.
The UN has called  on  all  states  to  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  which
addresses not only climate change and therefore a response  to  energy,  but
also a host of unsustainable practices. Sadly, it is  those  countries  that
consume the largest amounts of  energy  that  have  refused  to  ratify  the
protocol. Our mass electrification programme in  South  Africa  is  our  own
response to Agenda 21. Without doubt our programme has been one of the  most
successful mass electrification programmes of  all  time.  Since  1991  more
than 3,3 million homes have been provided with electricity.

The third area of  focus  is  agricultural  productivity.  Land  degradation
affects perhaps as much as two thirds of the world's agricultural  land.  As
a result, agricultural productivity is declining sharply  while  the  number
of mouths to feed continues to grow.  In  Africa,  especially,  millions  of
people are threatened with famine and starvation. Sadly,  on  the  continent
we do not have the research capacity that is  able  to  identify  the  exact
reasons for the present low levels  of  agricultural  productivity  and  the
relation of  this  to  environmental  degradation.  The  current  famine  in
Southern Africa requires much research.

The  fourth  area  of  focus  is  biodiversity  and  ecosystem   management.
Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate. Much of  this  is  as  a
result of the impact of human activity. Half of the  tropical  rain  forests
and mangroves of the world have already  been  lost.  About  75%  of  marine
fisheries have been fished to  capacity  and  one  can  imagine  what  would
happen in Cape Town if we could not get our hake and kabeljou. About 70%  of
coral reefs are endangered.

Finally, there is the area of health. The links between the environment  and
human health  are  powerful  links.  Toxic  chemicals  and  other  hazardous
materials are basic elements of  development,  yet  more  than  one  billion
people breathe unhealthy air and three million people  die  each  year  from
air pollution - two thirds of them poor people, mostly women  and  children,
dying from indoor pollution caused by burning wood and dung.

Water, energy, health, agriculture  and  biodiversity;  that  is  the  basic
agenda of the  United  Nations.  On  14  May  2002,  in  a  speech  entitled
``Towards  a  Sustainable  Future'',  the  UN  Secretary-General  ended   by
suggesting that the most creative agents of change must be unleashed at  the
Johannesburg  summit  and  that  these  have  to  be  partnerships   between
governments, private businesses and nonprofit organisations.

This is where Nepad comes in. We are all,  as  parliamentarians  in  Africa,
familiar with Nepad.  It  is  remarkable  how  this  concept  has  generated
African and world interest and support. It is good news  out  of  Africa.  A
great deal is still to be achieved, but wherever  we  go  people  are  aware
that Africa has its own plan. Nepad has five important pillars.

The first pillar is African ownership. We insist, through this  partnership,
on African ownership, on  African  responsibility  and  African  leadership.
Nepad is our blueprint for Africa. It is a process owned  by  the  continent
and it is supported, presently,  by  the  developed  world.  At  the  recent
meeting of the G8 in Canada, it was noted by leaders of  G8  countries  that
this is, first and foremost, a pledge by African leaders to  the  people  of
Africa to  consolidate  democracy  and  sound  economic  management  and  to
promote peace, security and people-centred development.

The second pillar lies in partnership. The  project  is  about  establishing
new  partnerships  with  the  developed  world,  about  establishing  mutual
commitments and enforcing new obligations. It provides the framework  for  a
new kind of engagement with the world, a new kind  of  relationship  between
Africa and the developed  world.  It  is  a  relationship  based  on  mutual
accountability and mutual respect, an opportunity  to  move  away  from  the
colonial legacy and the donor-recipient mentality.

The third pillar is peace. We as a continent  have  committed  ourselves  to
minimising conflict and we welcome successes that we have had in this  area,
particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We  also  anticipate  that
we will have success in ending the conflict in Burundi and that the  current
initiatives in Sudan will bear fruit.

The fourth pillar is  good  governance.  We  are  committed  to  maintaining
transparency and accountability in institutional support mechanisms for  the
market. We are committed to taking responsibility, through  Nepad,  for  the
development of our continent and its responses to its needs.
The fifth pillar is regional integration.  We  are  committed  to  promoting
regional and continental economic integration. This will be a  long  process
to reverse decades of decline in the  living  standards  of  the  people  of
Africa and to foster  long-term  sustainable  development.  All  of  us  are
familiar with the  challenges  that  confront  our  continent:  46%  of  the
population of sub-Saharan Africa lives on less than US $1 a day; 20% of  the
population of our continent is affected by conflict - one  person  in  five;
25,3 million Africans are suffering from the Aids pandemic; and  46  million
primary-school-aged children are not enrolled in school.

These  figures  indicate  why  we  must  take  action  towards   sustainable
development. They illustrate why African leaders have devoted so  much  time
and effort  to  creating  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development.
President Mbeki, in partnership with other African  leaders,  has  played  a
leading  role  in  creating  this  vision  of  a  new  partnership  for  the
continent. We must, then, draw attention to those issues on which we  should
make some progress and areas that we believe  should  be  addressed  at  the
Johannesburg summit with respect to Nepad.

The first of these areas is that of trade liberalisation. The architects  of
Nepad recognise in the document that development assistance alone  will  not
deliver the economic growth necessary to lift  millions  of  people  out  of
poverty. Fairer trade and  inward  investment  are  the  keys  to  sustained
economic growth. Africa's share of world trade today has dropped from 4%  in
1990 to only 2,2% in 2001. If the South African economy is taken out of  the
equation, the position is even worse. Sub-Saharan Africa's  share  of  world
trade is just 1%. There is growing recognition within the G8 countries  that
developed markets need to be further opened to African products.

We all know from press reports that agricultural subsidies  are  an  emotive
issue in the European Union and the United States. In fact, although  it  is
noteworthy that  donor  grants  annually  to  Africa  equal  around  US  $50
billion, it is also noteworthy that subsidies in the developed  world  stand
at US $360 billion annually. If these subsidy levels were reduced by a  mere
40%, the impact on development opportunities in the developing  world  would
be phenomenal.

There is much that can be done within Africa itself  to  promote  trade  and
regional integration within the continent. Trade  barriers  between  African
countries remain a real impediment to growth. It is within  Africa's  power,
now, to begin the  process  of  reducing  these  barriers  and  of  pursuing
innovative policies to enhance trading opportunities on  the  continent  and
to create conditions of economic success that  will  alleviate  poverty  and
thus contribute to building the conditions for sustainable development.

The second area that must be addressed is that of the massive debt  that  we
have in the developing world. Developed countries have made  an  undertaking
to ensure that poor countries have a sustainable level of debt. The  Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative is targeted to reduce the debt burden  of
22 African countries by US $19 billion. Combined with other debt relief  and
bilateral debt-forgiveness, the total debt  reduction,  if  agreements  were
implemented, would amount to US  $30  billion.  The  problem  is,  there  is
little action in this area.

A third area that requires attention is that of education. It is vital  that
we increase support for basic education  in  Africa  through  bilateral  aid
agencies. In our education programmes we would  have  to  pay  attention  to
knowledge around activities  that  contribute  to  sustainable  development.
Speaking on  education,  the  Secretary-General  of  the  UN  has  said  the
following:


  Education is the single most  vital  element  in  combating  poverty,  in
  empowering women, in protecting children from hazardous and  exploitative
  labour and sexual exploitation, in promoting human rights and  democracy,
  in  protecting  the  environment  and  influencing   population   growth.
  Education is a path towards international peace and security.

According to the UN Children's Fund, 130 million children  of  school-going-
age in the developing world - ie 21% of  all  school-going-aged  children  -
enjoyed no access to basic education in the year 1999. Nearly two thirds  of
the children who are denied  this  right  to  education  are  girl-children.
Discrimination against girls based on  gender  perpetuates  the  educational
gap between boys and girls.

Much attention has been directed  to  barriers  girls  face  in  getting  to
schools, but the obstacles that girls  encounter  at  school  merit  serious
consideration. In particular, gender-based  violence  continues  to  require
attention. Policy-makers have to place emphasis not only  on  getting  girls
to school, but also on keeping them there by keeping them  safe  at  school.
Equal access is not enough. We need to do more to ensure  stable  situations
in our school settings. Our Government has made a pledge to ensure that  all
South African children enjoy access to education. If our governments are  to
close the gender gap, which they have  identified  as  an  urgent  priority,
they have to confront the problems that confront young women  and  girls  in
our schools.

We also have to address the issue of traditional customs and practices  that
relegate girls and women to subordinate status. We have to look at work  and
time-consuming  chores,  issues  of  early  marriage,  early  pregnancy  and
poverty that also  keep  girls  out  of  school.  Economic  constraints  and
cultural practices do direct parental choices  and  we  have  to  therefore,
through Government action, ensure that girls enjoy opportunities  that  will
lift them out of poverty and therefore render them citizens who  can  assist
us in addressing the challenges of sustainable development.

The long-term social benefits  of  education  for  girls  include  increased
family incomes, later marriages, reduced  fertility  rates,  reduced  infant
and maternal mortality rates, better-nourished and  healthier  children  and
families, greater opportunities and life choices for women,  better  chances
to avoid disease, greater political  participation  and,  finally,  improved
economic opportunities. The positive effects  of  education  for  girls  and
boys accrue to the whole of a society.

Another area we must give attention to is that of North  respect  for  South
sustainability. Africa will not survive if the North continues  to  view  us
as an area ripe for exploitation.  Some  of  the  developed  countries  dump
waste on our continent, hunt our animals, steal our  flora,  fish  our  seas
and pay no regard to actions that will sustain our world and that will  help
us to lift ourselves out of our plight. [Interjections.]

What should we be doing, as parliaments, in order  to  give  effect  to  the
programmes that will be adopted at the  summit?  Parliaments  need  to  give
attention to the outcomes of the summit. Many countries on the continent  do
not have legislation and policy directed  at  environmental  protection  and
sustainable development. As we pursue the  positive  policy  areas  that  we
have  set  out  as  South  Africa's  contribution  to   reconstruction   and
development, it is vital for our parliaments to ensure  that  we  also  take
measures to support the important  areas  of  sustainable  development  that
have been highlighted as necessary for ensuring the survival of humanity.

Many of us would have noted  the  ship  containing  nuclear  waste  that  is
circling our shores in the South.  Not  much  action  in  legislative  terms
exists to deal with such activities and it  is  important  that  we  support
activists engaged in ensuring that the rich North does not  further  degrade
Africa. These activities, if they were successful, would ensure that  we  do
promote Nepad's objectives in the context of the World  Summit's  objectives
of an agenda for a sustainable world. [Applause.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, there is still some magic attached  to  the  idea
that a United Nations conference can be held in our  midst.  To  me  the  UN
belonged to a remote world in New York where ordinary people did not go  and
the issues they  discussed  were  not  only  beyond  my  understanding,  but
certainly beyond my influence.

Since South Africa became a democracy in 1994, the international  world  has
literally descended onto our doorstep. On account of our President's  desire
to make South Africa a global participant in the world economy and Africa  a
united force to support our need  for  development,  our  whole  psyche  has
undergone an internationalisation, Africanisation and democratisation.

Africa, however, is a continent beset with  man-made  problems  of  poverty,
hunger, disease and unemployment. The summit is an international  effort  to
address this and Nepad is our own step  towards  an  African  solution.  Its
strategy to propel us into the sphere of developed  rather  than  developing
countries, includes the following preconditions as indispensable:  A  series
of commitments by participating countries to  create  or  consolidate  basic
governance  processes  and  practice;  an   undertaking   by   participating
countries to take the  lead  in  supporting  initiatives  that  foster  good
governance;  the  institutionalisation  of   commitments   through   African
leadership to ensure that the core values of the initiative are abided by.
Neither the summit nor Nepad, however, will deliver  if  it  cannot  promise
true and deep democracy. This is what the President of the Islamic  Republic
of Iran said recently:


  Democratic principles deserve to become the  new  norm  governing  global
  interactions. The needs of a few power holders should not  supersede  the
  interests of  humanity  through  their  now  familiar  practices  of  not
  censoring undemocratic governments, being unresponsive to  the  will  and
  needs of their people and  applying  double  and  multiple  standards  in
  response to incidents around the globe.

This sentiment was repeated at the recent G8 summit  in  Canada,  previously
referred to, where it was agreed that at  least  R60  billion  would  go  to
Africa, but only  to  those  countries  who  were  committed  to  the  Nepad
principles.  UN  Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan  has   spelled   out   other
qualifications for success. Africa's persistent  image  as  a  continent  in
crisis tends to discourage domestic and foreign investors  from  recognising
or taking advantage  of  the  opportunities  that  Africa  offers  them.  It
imposes almost as high a risk premium on countries that are not in  conflict
as on those that are.

The world summit on sustainable investment is a  huge  opportunity  for  the
promotion of South Africa and Nepad, but only if we manage to convey to  all
the powerful leaders who will be there that we are truly committed to  those
principles  we  espouse  on  the  world  stage  and  which  they  set  as  a
prerequisite for co-operation.

The world summit is a wonderful opportunity for  illustrating  our  leaders'
unwavering commitment to these principles. It gives us  a  world  stage  for
voicing our unambiguous condemnations of the actions of President Mugabe  in
Zimbabwe.  The  only  real  reason  for  the  starvation  facing  Zimbabwean
citizens is the reprehensible destruction of food  production  which  he  is
selling as land reform. He is not only doing short-term damage to Nepad  and
the African Union, but he is condemning his own people to  long-term  hunger
and hopelessness.  He  has  robbed  farmworkers  of  a  livelihood,  he  has
enriched his cronies with gifts of land and he has created a  class  of  so-
called war veterans for whom he has promised land but for whom he  gives  no
means of sustaining production.

This can still be reversed. South Africa can take the lead at the summit  to
show that we can be trusted with the future of Africa. President Mbeki  must
convince SADEC and the rest of the world to save Zimbabwe.  It  is  planting
time now, reinstitute existing farmers onto the land and within  six  months
Zimbabwe can escape looming disaster. There can be no better way to  promote
Nepad at the summit. The whole world will see  that  we  are  serious  about
issues of governance and acting on a set of principles and core values  that
will  allow  poor  people  to  gain  power  through   participation,   while
protecting them from the arbitrary, unaccountable actions in their lives  by
governments, multinational corporations and other forces.

Sustainable development, the need to improve the  quality  of  life  without
depleting  the  world's  resources,  is  a  massive  challenge  to   Africa,
particularly as it depends not only on how we deal with our resources  which
will decide our future, but  also  how  the  rest  of  the  world  acts.  By
illustrating our commitment to proper governance we will set  the  tone  for
the summit. The challenges which Nepad faces are multitudinous, but  so  are
the opportunities, and we should not miss the great chance that  the  summit
offers.

Mr G B BHENGU: Thank you Chairperson and hon members. This World  Summit  is
a declaration of hope to the people of Africa first, and of the world,  that
the leadership of countries  of  the  world  are  committed  to  eradicating
poverty and achieving sustainable economic growth and promoting  sustainable
development as well as advancing to a fully inclusive and  equitable  global
economic system. Our presence here signals unequivocally  that  together  we
will act as an important force for global change. We are here to  break  new
ground and to break the  frontier  of  what  is  possible  for  attaining  a
balanced global environment.

What is of great importance is that we must all commit to a  partnership  of
mutual accountability  between  the  North  and  the  South  to  effect  the
necessary changes as represented, for instance, by the New  Partnership  for
Africa's  Development.  The  premise  of  this  partnership   must   be   an
unambiguous commitment to solving problems together in  a  spirit  of  joint
responsibility among governments, the private sector  and  organs  of  civil
society. We must appeal for greater focus  on  the  objective  of  defeating
poverty and underdevelopment, simplification  of  procedures  and  achieving
greater transparency in the awarding of grants.

The IFP supports the concept of the promotion of Nepad  within  the  context
of the World Summit on Sustainable Development. While it is  not  the  first
development plan for Africa, Nepad is new in the sense that  for  the  first
time our African leaders have taken the initiative and have actively  become
involved in the conceptualisation of the programme and  in  working  towards
its implementation. Nepad aims  at  poverty  eradication,  reversal  of  the
marginalisation of Africa and promoting sustainable  development,  democracy
and good governance on the continent.

Before one can go further with the promotion of Nepad within the context  of
the World Summit on Sustainable Development, one needs  to  understand  what
sustainable development is. Sustainable development is the development  that
meets the needs of the present without compromising the  ability  of  future
generations.

To meet their needs, we need to preserve the earth  for  future  generations
as we have found it. When one looks at the theme chosen for the WSSD  to  be
held  in  Johannesburg  next  week,   which   is,   ``People,   Planet   and
Prosperity'', it calls for improving the quality of life of  all  people  in
the world without increasing the use of natural resources. The IFP  believes
that Africa as a developing continent still  has  a  unique  opportunity  to
lead the way. Africa is  rich  in  agricultural,  mineral  and  aquatic  raw
materials that need to be used to develop the continent's  economy  and  its
people. We still have a chance to do  it  right  the  first  time.  We  have
learned from the mistakes of the developed  countries,  which  have  largely
destroyed  their  own  natural  resource  bases  and  are  now  looking   to
developing countries to provide them with such resources.  However,  as  the
President of our country said in a  speech  on  Nepad  last  year:  ``We  in
Africa need to add value to our natural resources through  beneficiation  so
that the rest of the world receive  them  as  manufactured  goods,  and  not
merely as raw materials.''

Some  of  Africa's  obstacles  to  sustainable  development  have  been  the
devastating results of wars on the environment. Nepad seeks to address  this
through environmental initiative  programmes,  which  seek  to  nurture  the
vast, complex and rich African environment for the benefit of all  humanity.
The programme deals with combating  desertification,  wetlands  conservation
and  water  management,  global  warming,  transfrontier  conservation   and
environmental governance.
The IFP supports the promotion of Nepad within  the  context  of  the  World
Summit on Sustainable Development. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson and colleagues, the New Partnership  for  African
Development or Nepad is an action plan based  on  globalist  and  Africanist
partnerships for  African  development  in  the  21st  century.  It  creates
obligations for African leaders  and  nations,  but  it  is  also  a  global
partnership with obligations for the G8 countries. While  the  situation  on
the African continent calls for action, poverty, as well  as  uneven  access
to resources, infectious diseases,  persistent  undemocratic  governance  in
some states, and too many armed conflicts threaten Africa's human and  state
security. Threats to security, development and democracy therefore  need  to
be addressed urgently and Nepad offers such a framework.

Prior to  Nepad,  co-ordinated  co-operation  plans  were  largely  lacking.
However, the fundamental  objective  of  Nepad  is  to  promote  sustainable
development on the African continent  in  a  manner  which  encompasses  the
burning  social,  economic  and   environmental   issues,   especially   the
eradication of poverty by meeting the millennium development  goals.  It  is
generally understood and accepted that this is a necessary  precondition  to
place the continent, as a  whole,  on  a  path  of  sustainable  growth  and
development.  Countries  agree  that  the  World   Summit   on   Sustainable
Development must focus on the implementation and hence the establishment  of
concrete actions at all levels to achieve sustainable development  including
regional initiatives such as Nepad.

It is  also  agreed  that,  to  achieve  sustainable  development,  it  will
require, amongst other things, a just and equitable social  order  based  on
the eradication of poverty as a developmental obstacle.

Poverty is both the cause  and  result  of  economic  inefficiency  and  the
underutilisation of our nation's resources, and results in  great  suffering
amongst our people. It has severe implications for virtually every facet  of
our national life and reflects  a  situation  where  more  than  20  million
people, numbering over half of our population, have incomes well  below  the
minimum necessary to make ends meet, and are living in abject poverty.

Two thirds of our  children  live  in  poor  families.  The  effect  on  our
children growing up under its shadow is significant and lasting. In  dealing
with domestic poverty on a continent where migration in search  of  economic
opportunity is a  general  feature,  South  Africa  is  confronted  with  an
additional problem of dealing with the consequences of the policies  of  its
neighbours in Southern Africa and further afield.

The  interconnectedness  of  many  of  the  causes  of   poverty   and   its
consequences, however, suggests that the reduction of  domestic  poverty  is
also a regional issue. It is evident that South Africa,  together  with  the
rest of sub-Saharan Africa, could lose  the  battle  against  poverty  if  a
comprehensive regional strategy is not implemented. There is,  therefore,  a
priority needed in our country and indeed on our continent to attack,  in  a
sustainable way, the fundamental roots of poverty.
South Africa's integration into  the  global  economic  mainstream  and  its
constructive engagement with its neighbours to help stabilise  the  Southern
African  region  and  the  African  continent  is  of  vital  interest   and
importance if we are  to  address  and  overcome  the  problem  of  domestic
poverty.

In conclusion, the New NP believes that South Africa must work  purposefully
through the mechanisms provided by the  Nepad  initiative  and  the  African
Union  towards  promoting  democracy  and  responsible   economic   policies
necessary  for  increased  confidence,  investment  and  prosperity  in  the
region. We also firmly believe that the 2002  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development will not only contribute towards  the  accomplishment  of  these
goals, but that it  will  leave  its  beneficial  mark  on  Africa  and  its
children for generations to come.

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, after listening to Dr Conroy and  Ms  Botha  I
thought that it is necessary for me to start from the beginning.

Members will remember that, in July 1979, African heads  of  states  met  in
Monrovia. What they intended to do  in  that  meeting  was  to  examine  the
economic problems that faced the African continent.  In  that  meeting  they
came to a conclusion that concrete  steps  had  to  be  taken  in  order  to
realise national and collective self-reliance in  the  economic  and  social
domain which faced the continent  as  a  result  of  the  new  international
economic order.

That meeting further resolved amongst other things,  to  do  the  following:
promote economic and social integration of  the  African  economies;  create
national,  subregional  and  regional  institutions  in  pursuit  of   self-
reliance;  ensure  self-reliance  in  food  production;  and  guarantee  the
African people proper and adequate  nutrition,  together  with  other  basic
needs which are necessary for a civilised standard of living.

The OAU Secretary-General  and  the  Executive  Secretary  of  the  Economic
Commission for Africa were charged with  the  responsibility  of  coming  up
with a sound plan in order to put in place the  above-mentioned  objectives.
That, then resulted in the formation of the  Lagos  Plan  of  Action  and  a
Final Act of Lagos for the economic development of Africa. The Final Act  of
Lagos committed the African governments to establishing an African  economic
commission by the year 2000. It stated clear steps that had to be  taken  to
that effect.

I thought that I should give that background because other people are  under
the impression that  Africa,  before  1994,  did  nothing  to  address  this
question. On 31 October 2001, in the Joint Sitting of the National  Assembly
and the National Council of Provinces, the President, Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki,
had this to say and I quote:


  When, at the end of the century, historians cast  their  eyes  back  over
  this, the 21st and African century, what will they see? They  should  see
  that Africa has, at last, emerged from a long period of darkness and fear
  into one of light and a dream fulfilled. They should see the reality of a
  new African who,  having  refused  to  be  conditioned  by  circumstances
  imposed by a past of slavery,  of  colonialism,  of  neo-colonialism,  of
  racism and apartheid, has succeeded in creating a new world of peace,  of
  democracy, of development and of prosperity. These are Africans who  have
  chosen to define themselves in action. They have  grown  tired  of  being
  told who they are, where they come from, where they ought to go  and  how
  they should proceed with their journey.  Because  they  have  decided  to
  become the masters and mistresses of their own destiny, to sing their own
  songs and to dance to their own tune, they have succeeded in claiming the
  21st century as their own.

Unlike the earlier initiatives, Nepad,  in  line  with  what  the  President
said, tackles the issues of good governance frankly and goes further to  set
up institutional  mechanisms  that  can  put  politics  at  the  command  of
economics in Africa. Nepad is not shy  to  support  democracy.  It  is  very
clear on peace, security and human rights as issues which  are  critical  to
any prospect of development in Africa. Priority will  be  given,  therefore,
to the settlement of internal conflict in  Africa  and  the  creation  of  a
political democratic order, wherever such order is wanting.

Since 1992 to date, there have been a number  of  changes.  Amongst  others,
the creation of the World Trade Organisation, and  an  increased  number  of
regional trade agreements etc. These changes, therefore,  suggest  that  the
programme for sustainable development  that  was  agreed  upon  at  the  Rio
Summit in 1992, commonly known as Agenda 21, needs to  be  recontextualised.
Hopefully, those who will be attending  that  summit,  on  behalf  of  South
Africa, will begin to engage with that question.

Nepad is a document which is conscious of political economy and the role  of
subjective factors in influencing forces of  social  transformation.  It  is
fully conscious of  the  structural  constraints  that  the  world  economic
system places on the potential  for  development  in  Africa.  It  therefore
suggests   engagement   and   partnership   rather   than   dependence   and
subservience.

The engagement that we are talking about is to, amongst others,  renegotiate
international trade arrangements,  improve  equity  in  the  WTO  rules  and
regulations, reduce unequal exchange in  international  commerce,  and  have
better and more  rewarding  access  to  foreign  markets.  This  partnership
implies a kind of social democracy at a global level whereby those who  have
been favoured by history, for various reasons, and  thus  developed,  should
have some vested interests in investing in  the  rapid  development  of  the
currently underdeveloped Africa. That should be done, provided  that  it  is
done with the African leaders taking the initiatives. [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, I  apologise.  It  seems  that  there  is  muti
around here, we always miss  cards.  I  do  not  know  why  this  continues.
[Laughter.]

I think the World Summit on Sustainable Development serves as a world  forum
to underpin the relevance of Nepad. I  just  want  to  rally  a  bit  around
Nepad. It is currently argued that Africa would  not  be  a  continent  with
more than 80%  of  its  inhabitants  still  living  in  varying  degrees  of
poverty. Hence, the 1980 OAU-inspired Lagos  Plan  of  Action  succeeded  in
carrying out its aims and objectives to their logical conclusion.

Nepad is a product of the New Africa Initiative  which  was  adopted  during
the 37th OAU Summit and has since been recognised in Africa  and  abroad  as
the top priority development for our continent.

The catchword ``Nepad'' has been coined for  the  sake  of  convenience  and
does not suggest to me that it differs substantially  from  the  one  called
Lagos Plan of Action which my friend and I have already alluded to.

If one were asked to depict what the Nepad mission basically is,  one  would
echo the words of Dr E Links when he said, and I quote:


  It contains the  seminal  seeds  for  the  regeneration  of  the  African
  continent that has been ravaged for so long by  wars,  famine  and  other
  scourges.

Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu, who is the  CEO  for  Nepad,  has  aptly  depicted
Nepad from the social point of view as follows, and I quote:


  The initiative [Nepad] serves as a means of consolidating  the  pride  of
  Africa's people in their own humanity and as a confirmation of the common
  humanity of the people of the world.

No state within the African continent can claim to  be  self-sufficient  and
adequately equipped to manage  its  domestic  problems  single-handed.  When
HIV/Aids strikes in Ethopia, the A-B-C gospel-A - abstain, B - be  faithful,
C - condomise - will spread  to  Kenya,  Uganda,  Sudan,  etc,  because  the
disease knows no boundary. The effects of  famine,  wars  and  land  matters
like we see in  Zimbabwe  now  permeate  through  our  borders  and  have  a
negative impact in the neighbouring states.  Therefore,  the  need  for  the
partnership in addressing the African continent's  constraints  collectively
and jointly, cannot be overemphasised.

Nepad has destined itself to actively participate  in  the  global  business
such as trade and investment, agricultural development and  energy.  As  has
already been indicated by people such as Xabashe, the electricity  producers
union could help move the  continent  towards  self-reliance  in  line  with
Nepad, areas in trade and investment, agricultural development  and  mining,
ICT in Africa as well as in the field of HIV/Aids economics.

Because I am used to three to four minutes, I am obsessed with preparing  my
speech  very  briefly.  [Laughter.]  In  conclusion,  may  I  commend   this
initiative and wish it success. Let not the experiences of  the  1980  Lagos
Plan  of  Action  and  those  of  the  organisation   of   intergovernmental
organisation established on 25 May 1963 repeat themselves. I wonder if I  am
on the same wavelength with the House when I  talk  about  these  particular
ventures of this organisation. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson and hon members of the House.  After  listening
to the hon Chairperson of the NCOP,  I  thought  of  rippling  out  of  this
debate.  [Laughter.]  Two  days  hence  our  country   would   witness   the
convergence of the largest international crowd that has  ever  come  to  our
country. Except for sporting events no other event has ever  drawn  together
a crowd in excess of 65 000 people. The purpose  of  this  World  Summit  on
Sustainable  Development  would  be  to  deliberate  on  issues  of   common
developmental concern.

However, the emphasis as I see it, would fall on  the  promotion  of  Nepad.
This programme is about moving away from the continent's broad  reliance  on
loans  and   aid,   towards   self-sustaining   development   and   economic
advancement. A Setswana idiom says`` mphemphe o a lapisa motho  o  kgona  ke
sa gagwe''. This means that asking and asking again is tiring. A  person  is
satisfied by his own.

One of the main objectives of Nepad  is  to  get  the  support  of  as  many
industrially advanced outside countries as possible, in return for good  and
democratic governance without which it would  be  impossible  to  engage  in
meaningful economic activity. Whilst  we  are  wooing  the  support  of  the
industrially advanced outside countries, we should, as different  affiliates
of this country, be prepared to provide that  co-operation  and  support  to
each other even before it is sought from us. Charity begins at home.

This summit, as I understand it, is the first of its  kind  in  our  country
and it is therefore noncomparable with anything that ever happened here.  It
is unique. All it needs from us is support and more  support.  A  disturbing
feature at this time in our  history  is  our  Northern  neighbour,  who  is
roaring like a wounded lion in a jungle.  He  needs  our  special  attention
lest he scares away our visitors and other friends. [Laughter.]

His  latest  way  of  dealing  with  the  farmers  and  the  opposition   is
intolerable and I think President Mbeki must act now and take  the  bull  by
its horns. Apart from that, we wish all the delegates  to  the  summit  good
deliberations and that the summit achieves what it is intended to achieve.

Ms  J  L  KGOALI:   Modulasetulo,   le   Motlats'amodulasetulo,   maloko   a

[Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, hon members of this House, it is  a  great
honour for me today to have this opportunity to speak about the issues  that
have been  dealt  with  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces. It is sometimes surprising when the opposition parties  refer  to
the President of the country when they are talking  about  positive  things,
and when they talk about negative things they  just  call  him  by  name.  I
would therefore like to say, we should be aware that our  history  is  being
compiled, and it will mention that  Mr  Mbeki  is  the  one  who  did  those
positive things.]

For far too long Africa has been seen as a  problem  to  be  solved,  rather
than as a challenge presenting a  set  of  interests  and  values  that  are
shared with the rest of the world, while most of  its  inhabitants  live  in
abject poverty. To me  this  is  perhaps  not  a  surprising  image,  for  a
continent where half of its eight million people exist on less than US $1  a
day. It is however, encouraging to note that recent events  suggest  a  more
positive future for the African continent.

A plenary session of the 2002 meeting of the World Economic  Forum  held  in
New York, was focused  on  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development
(Nepad). A plan that will focus and is focused  on  Africa's  reconstruction
in cooperation with industrialised countries. Ten  percent  of  the  world's
population live in sub-Saharan Africa, and yet the region produces only  one
percent of the global GDP.

The total combined annual economic  output  of  the  48  economies  of  sub-
Saharan Africa is just $300 million roughly, the same as that  of  Argentina
which has approximately 30 million inhabitants. Nepad's  vision,  born  from
former initiatives such as the Millennium Partnership for  African  Recovery
Programme, and later as Nepad, is being spearheaded  by  the  South  African
President, the honourable Thabo Mbeki. Its  aim  is  to  revitalise  African
economies by promoting intra-African trade,  and  infrastructure  links,  to
establish conditions of good economic and political governance.

As such, Nepad not only represents  a  way  to  bridge  growing  development
divides internationally, but it also means a way  by  which  the  industrial
world can show their commitment to Africa's development. Today we have  five
days to go to the opening of the WSSD to be held on  South  African  shores,
which will not necessarily dwell purely on environmental issues,  but,  more
importantly, will focus on the needs of the developing world.  It  will  aim
to link poverty with human development.

I believe that sustainability is one of the most  important  issues  of  the
21st century, and that the focus on environmental protection solely, is  not
enough. Hopefully, this summit aims to demonstrate how  the  people  of  the
developing world have suffered as a result of  the  disproportionately  high
consumption of the earth's natural resources by the rich  countries  of  the
developed nations.

I want to say that our concerns, as Africans, are that the  reality  of  the
world today is still very much like it was in 1992. A  world  where  poverty
and inequality are still prevalent. We still live in a world where the  poor
are victims of cultural destruction, social injustice, and  economic  deaths
and struggles, for access to the basic human rights, of a clean and  healthy
environment. These needs also manifest themselves acutely in our country.

It is for these reasons that the WSSD presents us  as  South  Africans,  and
indeed as Africans, with the unique opportunity to  communicate  our  vision
as contained in Nepad, for a just and equitable world.  Moreover,  it  gives
us an opportunity to address the  Southern  African  region's  challenge  to
eradicate poverty, to place our countries on a path  of  sustainable  growth
and development.

[Chairperson, we would like to see our  country,  South  Africa,  and  other
African countries in general, being  developed.  They  should  be  countries
where people have  a  better  life,  the  life  that  everyone  wishes  for.
Therefore, we want to show that we, as the  ANC,  will  always  support  our
President, Mr Thabo Mbeki, so that  we  can  have  a  beautiful  Africa,  an
Africa that has a better life,  with  better  governments,  ones  which  are
governable. [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I would like to begin by  thanking
all the hon members who have participated in  this  debate.  I  think  their
contributions have been most insightful and helpful in elaborating  on  this
important subject.

In commenting on some of the areas that have been  raised,  I  think  it  is
important to stress that we have had action before,  but  we  have  not  had
responses. We have had reviews, but we have not had  implementation.  A  lot
of what is required does  not  depend  on  the  poor  developing  world.  It
depends on the rich developed world.

The rich developed world does not want to  respond.  A  large  part  of  our
problems stem from the greedy and selfish actions of the Western World ...

Hon MEMBERS: Yes.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: ... their racism,  their  uncaring  capitalism,
and their poor attention to the needs of the developing world. All of  these
have played a role in environmental degradation. That is the reason. If  one
has countries whose sole want is energy for themselves only,  who  take  all
the oil that is produced in the world and have no regard for the  developing
parts of the world,  then  one  has  a  very  serious  problem,  and  little
attention is paid to addressing sustainable development.

The greatest threats to  global  sustainable  development  are  poverty  and
inequality. The most poor in the world, and the most unequal  in  the  world
are in Africa. In order to  achieve  sustainable  development,  we  have  to
address poverty and inequality.
If we look at the plans for Africa that have been referred to  -  the  Lagos
Plan and other plans - they did not succeed primarily because they  did  not
enjoy support  from  the  West.  The  West  has  never  been  interested  in
assisting our continent to succeed. The West  has  merely,  in  a  rapacious
way, made use of our natural resources without wanting  to  put  back,  into
the continent, support to ensure  that  we  do  succeed  in  developing  our
people.

In conclusion, I have to repeat what I said earlier, and that is that we  as
parliaments must pay more attention to issues  of  sustainable  development.
As this Parliament  and  as  this  House,  we  must  look  at  the  form  of
legislation that we have which gives attention to matters  relating  to  the
environment. We have to ensure that we monitor business practices.  A  great
deal of complaints have been heard,  for  example,  emanating  from  certain
communities here in the Western Cape about pollution. As a  House,  have  we
looked at that pollution? Have we looked at what legislation  governs  those
businesses in their practice and the  escalation  of  poisonous  gases  that
have been complained about?

In terms of agricultural practices, what reviews are we carrying out on  the
use of hazardous pesticides or  hazardous  fertilisers  and  other  products
that can lead to the kind of environmental waste  and  danger  that  we  are
talking about? What have we done, as this House, to monitor  the  management
of waste in our provinces? Are we  managing  waste?  Are  we  finding  waste
being dumped in our country? Do we know exactly what is going  on?  Much  of
this  activity  occurs  in  secrecy.  With  our  powers  of  oversight   and
monitoring, we should be playing much more of an active  role  in  order  to
ensure  that  we  do  protect  the  environment  and  that  we  support  the
development both of the continent and the people who live in  Africa.  Other
areas  on  which  Government  has  sought  support  has  been  the  use   of
biodegradable materials. What are we doing in this area as this House?

In conclusion, it is vital that our parliaments pay attention to  issues  of
sustainable development; take an interest in environmental  protection,  and
take an interest in saving the world, for the people of the world,  not  for
itself, because if we do not develop responses that sustain  our  world,  it
is humanity that dies. All our actions are directed at ensuring that  people
can live safely, that humanity  can  survive  and  that,  finally,  we  will
eradicate poverty and inequality in our world.

I would like to thank everyone for having participated. I hope we  will  all
contribute to the debates at the World Summit. I would just like to  say  to
the hon Tlhagale that the hon Kolweni sitting here next to  me  informed  me
that the ANC, at some of its rallies, has  had  more  than  80  000  people.
Therefore, there have been gatherings in South Africa of more  than  50  000
persons! [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That concludes  the  discussion  and  we
take this opportunity to thank  the  Chairperson  for  leading  us  in  this
important discussion and in preparation for the coming  conference.  I  hope
members are properly armed to go and  participate  actively  in  this  World
Summit.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
 AFFAIRS - EXCLUSION OF TWO PORTIONS OF LAND FROM KALAHARI GEMSBOK NATIONAL
                                    PARK

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson and hon members, it is important that  the  Ae!
Kalahari Heritage Park Agreement is seen in its proper  historical  context.
For generations the San and the Mier communities have used large  tracts  of
land in  the  Mier  and  adjacent  areas  for  hunting  and  food  gathering
purposes. However, the advent of colonialism,  and  subsequently  apartheid,
brought with it the evils of land expropriation and displacement.

The 2002 agreement follows on the 1999  agreement  signed  between  all  the
stakeholders, namely, the Khomani San community, the Mier community, the  SA
National Parks Board, the Ministers of Land  Affairs  and  Tourism  and  the
Minister of Public Works respectively, as well  as  the  commission  of  the
restitution of land rights.

In terms of the 2002 agreement, the National  Parks  and  the  Minister  for
Agriculture and Land Affairs will transfer approximately 28 000 ha  of  land
in the parks to the San community. This land is  adjacent  to  the  southern
boundary of the park adjacent to Twee Rivieren. It is  referred  to  as  the
San heritage land. The San community will be the owners of this land.

The SA National Parks and the Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs
will transfer approximately 30 000 ha of  land  in  the  park  to  the  Mier
community. This land is adjacent  to  the  southern  boundary  of  the  park
adjacent to the Mier game farms between Dabas and Loretto.  It  is  referred
to as the Mier heritage land. The Mier community will be the owners of  this
land. Therefore, the San and the Mier heritage land are jointly referred  to
as the heritage lands, because the San community has  been  dispossessed  of
much more than the Mier community. The 1999 agreement guaranteed  additional
and special rights to the San community in the remainder of the park.

The communities, mindful of the  historical  umbilical  cord,  undertook  to
utilise this land for conservation, ecotourism and cultural activities.  The
agreement, however, and importantly so, does not make provision for  housing
and mining. Also, in this agreement, the San  and  the  Mier  heritage  land
will be subject to separate contract park agreements with  the  SA  National
Parks. The key elements of this agreement are as follows:  the  SA  National
Parks will be responsible for the conservation of animals,  plants  and  the
natural environment; the community parties, by means of  the  entities  that
represent them, use the land in terms of the agreement as landowners.

Although the land forms  part  of  the  park,  the  community  parties  have
retained the commercial benefits and rights. The two  communities  may  also
use the land for symbolic and cultural purposes. Moreover, the SA Parks  and
the communities forum form a joint management board.  They  are,  therefore,
in terms of the agreement, referred to  as  the  main  parties.  Matters  of
communal concern will be discussed in this JMB.

The joint monitoring board will not be a separate legal entity.  Each  party
will act in its own name and will have the right  to  appoint  duly  elected
members to the joint monitoring board. The parties also  reserve  the  right
to launch and manage projects of their own,  with  each  other  or  with  an
external party. For example, the agreement does not  impose  any  obligation
on the Mier community to run any projects jointly with the San community  or
the SA National Parks.

Also, each contract has a lifespan of 99 years. However, the Mier  community
can terminate the agreement  regarding  the  Mier  heritage  land  after  30
years, as can the San community regarding the  San  heritage  land.  The  SA
National Parks  may  also  terminate  these  contracts  after  such  period.
Importantly, though, is that if any party wants to  terminate  the  contract
part, it has to give a three-year notice.
Although parties are free to undertake projects  on  their  own  as  earlier
mentioned, the main parties committed themselves, as the  main  project,  to
jointly establish a lodge. This lodge will be situated in  one  or  both  of
the parks. In this respect,  the  SA  National  Parks  has  already  secured
funding. The income that accrues from this lodge will be evenly  divided  on
an annual basis. Because of the San's  wider  historical  ownership  of  the
area, they have been afforded further rights in  the  agreement.  To  settle
this claim, the parties have agreed on the following: The SA  National  Park
agreed that the San community also have rights  to  the  San  heritage  land
over the remainder of the claimed area park.

In addition, the Mier community agreed to transfer 7 000 ha of land  in  the
Mier area to the San community as a gesture of good  neighbourliness  in  an
exchange for the latter abandonment of its claim in the Mier area.  However,
this land still needs to identified. Critically, though, this  is  in  terms
of the agreement. The Mier community is encouraged to do this  speedily  and
by no later than 27 May 2004. If not, the Mier obligation increases to  8000
ha.

Other exclusive rights to the sale include  the  following:  a  preferential
right  partnership  with  the  SA  National   Parks   regarding   ecotourism
development, symbolic and cultural rights. It is the San community's  stated
intention, with the possible assistance of the Mier  community,  to  acquire
additional rights for the community park. We believe the SA  National  Parks
are willing to assist in this regard. Central to the agreement is  also  the
provision of a dispute resolution mechanism.

In conclusion, the agreement took effect on 28 May this year and since  then
it can only be terminated by mutual agreement between the parties.  I  think
it is important for me to mention that in  terms  of  section  2(3)  of  the
National Parks Act, Act 57 of 1976, the said properties may not be  excluded
from the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, except under  the  authority  of  a
resolution of Parliament, and this is precisely what  we  are  going  to  do
today.
We  would  also  like  to  make  use  of  this  opportunity  to  extend  our
appreciation to the Ministers of Land Affairs and Environmental Affairs  and
Tourism and all other stakeholders for this  significant  achievement.  This
agreement will go  a  long  way  towards  contributing  to  the  sustainable
development of the land, the environment and  the  people  of  the  Northern
Cape as a whole. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! That  concludes
the debate. I shall now put the question. The question is  that  the  Report
be adopted. As the decision is dealt with in terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I need to ascertain  whether  delegation  heads  are  present,
because the House is depleted. I have to check on that.  Eastern  Cape,  are
you there? Free State's delegation head? Thank you. Gauteng?  KwaZulu-Natal?
Mpumalanga? Northern Cape? North West? Northern Province? Western Cape?  The
backbencher? Thank you.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declaration of vote if they so wish. Any province? I  take  it
there is none.

We shall now proceed  to  voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in  favour,  against  or  abstain  from  voting.

read the fifth order of the day.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF JOINT MONITORING COMMITTEE ON IMPROVEMENT OF
        QUALITY OF LIFE AND STATUS OF WOMEN - VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

Ms  M  P  THEMBA:  Sihlalo  lohlon,  malunga  lahlon,  manene  nemanenekati,
kuvisana  buhlungu  kakhulu  kukhuluma   nakufanele   sidzingidze   lendzaba
yekuhlukunyetwa kwabomake onkhe emalanga kodvwa kutfolakale  shangatsi  kute
inchubekela embili. (Translation of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, it  is  very
painful when one has to speak about and discuss matters of violence  against
women which happens every day, whilst,  obviously,  nothing  progressive  is
done about it.]

It is perhaps fitting to remind ourselves,  during  this  month  of  women's
emancipation,  about  the  words  of  our   first   democratically   elected
President, Comrade Nelson Mandela, during  the  opening  of  South  Africa's
first democratically elected Parliament, when he said: ``Freedom  cannot  be
achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.''

Indeed, the hon comrade was right, for we can never call our  country  fully
liberated if our women are not  free  from  these  shackles  of  oppression.
Indeed, violence against women is the worst  form  of  oppression  with  the
most devastating consequences both to women and the society at large.

The UNIFEM document, a Global Campaign on Elimination  of  Violence  Against
Women, describes violence against women as an obstacle  to  the  achievement
of the objectives of equality, development and peace.

Violence against women both violates and impairs or nullifies the  enjoyment
by women both of their human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms.  The  long
standing failure to protect and promote those rights and  freedoms,  in  the
case of violence against women, is a  matter  of  concern  to  everyone  and
should really be addressed.

It is an honour for me today to address this issue that  is  closest  to  my
heart, an issue that touches the depth of my soul  for  I  am  a  mother,  a
woman, I have daughters and I am part of our nation and our democracy. I  am
referring to violence against women. As the Joint  Monitoring  Committee  on
Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women, this  issue  is  central
to our committee.

As  a  nation  we  fought  against  all  forms  of  abuse,  oppression   and
discrimination. We fought for every South African, black or white,  male  or
female, to claim this land as his or her very own and exercise  his  or  her
freedom freely without fear and without  being  subjected  to  any  form  of
abuse.

Women were central to that struggle. We fought for a society  that  is  free
from violence against women which is, clearly, disrespect and abuse  of  the
individual's human and constitutional rights.
Violence against women is not confined to any race.  It  knows  no  economic
and social boundaries. It happens to women of all ages and it is present  in
both urban and  rural  areas.  Today  it  is  happening  to  someone  else's
daughter and tomorrow it could be yours or mine. It is definitely a  concern
that affects all of us from our diverse walks of life. It is an  issue  that
is never to be taken for granted.

It is a saddening reality of the times that we are living in that women  are
abused  everyday,  kuto   tonkhe   tindzawo,   endleleni,   emakhaya   kanye
nasemisebentini, bomake bahlala bahlukunyetwa. [Everywhere, along  the  way,
at their homes and at their workplaces, women are always abused.]

These realities are visible everywhere. In our media,  in  our  communities,
in the eyes of children whose innocence has been lost and in the eyes of  an
abused woman, mother or daughter, whose eyes reflect the loss  of  hope  and
self-esteem. They are not only visible in our  own  country  but  throughout
the world. We have heard of acid cases in  India,  of  forced  marriages  in
Nigeria, of Sharia law.

When I read about baby Tshepang my soul was shattered. When I heard about  a
women who, after years of  physical,  emotional  and  sexual  abuse  by  her
husband, was killed by that same husband, I was devastated. I have heard  of
cases where fathers have fathered their own  grandchildren.  The  list  goes
on.

These instances makes me wonder about where our democracy is going  to.  But
then I realise that sitting back and wondering never helped solve  anything.
The important  question  is,  what  can  be  done?  What  are  we  doing  as
Government, as leadership, as a nation, as societies and as communities?

What are we doing as church ministers and as teachers to combat and  prevent
these immoral, violent acts imposed on our women? What can  we  do  to  make
sure that this violence comes to an end so that our women feel safe  in  our
country? The same country that they also voted for. What  are  we  doing  to
extend our support to the victims  of  these  gruesome  deeds  and  inhumane
behaviour? Surely, we cannot sit back and  do  nothing  hoping  that  things
will change in their own time, for these acts  are  destroying  our  nation,
our future, the moral fibre of our society and our  children,  who  are  our
hope for tomorrow.

Based on the study that was conducted and presented to us by the  office  on
the status of women about three months ago, we,  the  committee,  discovered
that violence against women throughout most communities  was  pervasive.  It
was apparent through religious,  cultural,  traditional  practices,  beliefs
and value systems.

Further, there was also very little information about the actual  programmes
of Government. The whole issue of gender equality is  not  fully  integrated
as part of an overall development perspective.  It  was  concluded  that  we
cannot achieve the de facto equality if this is not addressed.
The study also looked at  the  issue  of  stereotyping.  According  to  this
study, most women interviewed felt that they are still portrayed  negatively
in the media. The issue of violence against women was  erroneous  throughout
the study and the link with HIV came out very  strongly.  It  is  no  secret
that women and children who have been victims of violence, sexual abuse  and
any  violence  face  special  risks  of  contracting  sexually   transmitted
diseases, particularly HIV/Aids.

In the hearings that we  conducted  last  year,  it  emerged  strongly  that
sexual assault and domestic violence are more  prevalent  in  South  African
society than ever recognised and that fear and expectation of violence is  a
way of life for many South African women. That  is  a  challenge  to  us  as
policy-makers and as the representation of the voices of our people  and  of
the abused women who are crying for protection against these monsters.

Clearly, we have passed some laws that protect women  against  violence  and
abuse. But more still needs to be done to  tighten  the  laws  and  also  in
terms of implementation of those laws, public awareness,  education,  health
and so on. With regards to the existing  shelters  for  abused  women,  more
still needs to be done.

The laws that we put in  place  alone  cannot  transform  the  cultural  and
social environment that gives rise to and condones the  widespread  violence
against women. Ending this kind of violence  requires  long-term  commitment
and strategies involving all parts of society.  Masivukeni  sizenzele.  (Let
us wake up and do it for ourselves.)

Community-based strategies can focus on empowering women,  reaching  out  to
men and changing the beliefs and attitudes that  permit  abusive  behaviour.
Only when women gain their place as equal members of society  will  violence
against women no longer be an invisible norm but a shocking aberration.  The
media can also play a vital  role  in  this  war  against  violence  against
women. It can be a powerful instrument  that  can  be  used  to  fight,  and
create awareness.
To conclude, let us join hands and fight  against  violence  against  women.
And I would further like to congratulate the Government of  the  people  for
its efforts and the role it has played in ensuring  that,  indeed,  violence
against women must come to an end. [Applause.]

Nkk B THOMSON:  Ngiyabonga  Mphathisihlalo,  ngithe  namhlanje  ake  ngizame
ukuthatha iziyalelo zakho ukuthi sikhulume ngendlela ezokwazi ukuthi  abantu
le ekhaya lapho siphuma khona bazame ukulandela ingxoxo  yethu.  Ukupheliswa
kodlame lwanoma iluphi uhlobo kuyinto ehlala isematheni  ethu  sonke.  Ulimi
lwethu selokhu kwaba ongaphansi nongaphezulu  sizama  ukuqhamuka  namakhambi
okuqeda  lesi  sihlava,  ikakhulukazi  abantwana  nabadala  sibabona  kuyibo
abaphezulu emlonyeni  walolu  dlame.  Ngiyacabanga  ukuthi  mhlawumbe  lokhu
kwenziwa amandla la amadoda anawo. Nokho-ke siyawacela la madoda  ukuthi  la
mandla awo  awawasebenzise  ngendlela  efanele.  Asiboni  ukuthi  kuyindlela
eyiyona ukuthi bawasebenzise kithina njengomame.  Uma  ngabe  befuna  ukulwa
abaphume udede laphaya namanye amadoda yikhona sizobona kahle.
Akuyona into enhle ukushaya umuntu egoqe izandla engaphindeseli. Lolu  dlame
luyagqama-ke  emakhaya,  ezikoleni,  emisebenzini  nasemiphakathini   yethu.
Kusemandleni ethu-ke njengamalungu ePhalamende ukuthi sizame  ukuyixosha  le
mpethu esiyibona iphithizela kubantu bethu.

Akukade khona kule Ndlu  sithole  umbiko  wekomidi  eliholwa  ubaba  uHwale,
ikomidi lezemfundo nezemidlalo. Sonke kulendlu sabamba ongezansi  uma  sizwa
ukuthi laba esibeka kubo amathemba ethu ukuthi basibhekele abantwana  bethu,
othisha phela, abanye babo yibo kanye abahlukumeza abantwana  bethu.  Siyazi
ukuthi  akusibo  bonke  othisha  abenza  lokho,   kodwa-ke   kulabo   thisha
abaqhubeka nokwenza lokho, singomama sithi balibambe lingashoni.

Siyabancoma-ke labo abawaziyo umsebenzi wabo abawuyela ezikoleni.

Iyadumaza  le  mibiko   ngoba   uma   sithumela   abantwana   bethu   sisuke
singazimisele ukuthi kanti  sebeyoba  amakhosikazi  ezikoleni,  sisuke  sazi
ukuthi bangabafundi.
Manje ngizothi ukuthinta futhi olunye uhlobo lodlame engaziyo  ukuthi  obaba

Kuyoba kubi-ke uma sithola ukuthi  amalungu  akule  Ndlu  nawo  angena  kulo
mkhakha wabantu abaxhaphaza abanye, ngeke kusijabulise  lokho.  (Translation
of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, today I decided to  take  your  advice  that  we
should speak in a way that will enable people at home, where we  come  from,
to understand and follow  our  debates.  The  eradication  of  any  form  of
violence is something that all of  us  always  talk  about.  We  are  always
talking about a solution to it, to eradicate  this  disease,  as  the  older
people and children are the ones who suffer most because of this disease.

I think that this is caused by the power that these men  have.  However,  we
ask these men to use their power in an appropriate manner. We do  not  think
that it is a good thing that they use their power on us as  women.  If  they
want to fight they should come out clearly  and  fight  a  fair  fight  with
other men so that we can see  their  power.  There  is  nothing  as  bad  as
beating someone who cannot beat you back.

This type of violence is rife in homes, schools,  workplaces,  even  in  our
communities. The onus is  upon  us  as  members  of  Parliament  to  try  to
eradicate this evil thing among our people.

Recently in this House, we read a report of the committee on  education  and
sport, which was led by Hwale. We were all shocked in  this  House  when  we
heard that the people who were entrusted with the job of looking  after  our
children, the teachers, have among them some  who  abuse  our  children.  We
know that not all of them are doing that. To those who do it,  as  women  we
say one day we will catch them. We would like  to  commend  those  who  know
what they are going to school to do.

These reports are saddening, because when we send our  children  to  school,
we do not mean that they should be made wives. We send them to be learners.

Now I am going to talk about another type of  violence  which  I  know  that
fathers of our children will not feel comfortable with when  we  talk  about
it, the so called spouse rape or maternal rape. As women we would  like  the
fathers of our children to understand that we use our bodies when we are  in
the mood to do so. When we say no, we have a right to  have  that  respected
when we say: No, father of my children, today I do not feel  I  want  to  do
it. [Applause.]

If he is a real father, one who has skill, he could  take  me  out  of  that
situation of not liking it. Therefore, men can use their skills  when  women
say they do not feel they want to do it. They should not use the  skills  of
violence. Down with violence!

Now let us go back to the Labour Relations Act of  father  Mdladlana,  where
we see woman-on-woman violence. We saw on  television  that  the  department
was up and down in factories looking for those who  exploit  workers.  As  a
member of the women's committee, I say, one day we will  need  to  launch  a
campaign that will go to the homes of the members of Parliament so  that  we
can see how they pay their workers. If you  do  not  want  to  do  your  own
washing, it is in your power to look for someone to do the washing for  you.
But if you want someone to do the washing for you,  to  cook,  to  make  the
beds for you and to wash your carpet, you must pay  for  all  these  things.
[Applause.]

It would be bad if we found that even members of this House  are  caught  in
this trap of people who exploit others. We will not be happy with that.]

As Government we require a very strong legislative framework that  seeks  to
harshly punish those who threaten our women. International  frameworks  such
as the UN convention have guided us on  the  elimination  of  all  forms  of
discrimination against women. That is the Sida, which we ratified  in  1995.
We agreed when we ratified this that we would  pursue,  by  all  appropriate
means and without delay, a policy eliminating discrimination  against  women
by refraining from  engaging  in  any  act  or  practice  of  discrimination
against women. We have been working slowly but surely  to  ensure  that  all
our  public  authorities  and  institutions  act  in  conformity  with   the
obligation not to discriminate against women.

In South Africa women themselves have become increasingly  aware  that  they
have rights and most are  no  longer  hesitant  to  assert  themselves.  The
Domestic Violence Act, notwithstanding its loopholes, has nonetheless put  a
very powerful weapon into the hands of abused women.

Kungumsebenzi wethu futhi thina esingamalungu ephalamende ukuthi  siwudayise
lo mthetho laphaya  emphakathini  ngoba  uthola  ukuthi  kwawona  amaphoyisa
awazi ukuthi usebenza kanjani.  Uthola  umama  elokhu  ehla  enyuka  egcwele
igazi,  elimele,  omunye  engambethe  ngasenhla,  ngoba  abawuqondi  kwabona
ukuthi usho ukuthini lo mthetho, kanti uyisikhali esinye  esingasetshenziswa
ekutheni   omama   abaxhashazwayo   bazame   ukukhosela   ngaphansi   kwawo.
(Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[It  is  our  responsibility  as  members  of  Parliament  to  market   this
legislation to our communities, because one finds that even the police  have
no idea of how this legislation works.  One  finds  a  woman  who  has  been
injured, full of blood and sometimes naked on the upper parts of  the  body,
walking up and down at the police station, because the police  do  not  know
how this legislation works. In fact, this legislation is a weapon  that  can
be used to protect abused women.]

The report  also  shows  the  increased  co-operation  between  the  various
stakeholders, including NGOs and government departments. It also  highlights
the areas that need more work, not the least of  which  is  an  increase  in
human  and  financial  resources  which  need  to   be   directed   to   the
implementation agencies such as those dealing  with  criminal  justice,  law
enforcement, welfare services and shelters. This report is a result of  hard
work and all those involved should be commended for their  dedication  to  a
project that will continue to remain at the forefront of our problems  until
we see the total eradication of violence.

Amadoda-ke  sicela  ukuba  akuqonde  ukuthi  thina  singomama  siyolwa  size
siyoshona silwela ukuthi amalungelo  abesifazane  ahlonishwe  kanti  kuphele
nokuxhashazwa komama. Ngiyabonga. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu  paragraph
follows.)

[We would like to ask men to clearly understand that we as women will  fight
until death for the respect of women's rights and  the  eradication  of  the
abuse of women. [Applause.]]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, hon members, I was just telling  my  colleague,
Mr Sulliman, one of the members here, that the reason we love women is  that
our mothers are women and they have taught us right. That  is  why  we  love
women.

It was after the United Nations General Conference in Mexico  in  1975  that
gender issues received attention. Prior  to  this  conference,  even  though
women were more educated,  more  active  economically  and  more  successful
professionally than they were a few decades before,  they  continued  to  be
seriously disadvantaged. In no major field of  activity,  be  it  economics,
education, health or government, have women attained equal status with men.

Violence is not a new phenomenon for South Africans. We  have  emerged  from
the apartheid era in which violence was used as a tool  to  maintain  social
control, and where  violence  was  used  in  the  struggle  to  bring  about
political change in South Africa. Fortunately, South Africans now live in  a
democracy having  achieved  liberation  from  oppression.  The  Constitution
enshrines the motion of equality and  seeks  to  preserve  the  basic  human
rights of each citizen, such as the right to  be  safe  from  violence,  and
physical and emotional harm.

Violence against women is perpetuated and reflected by the power  imbalances
between women and men and the fact  that  many  people  struggle  to  openly
condemn this atrocity against women. The cloud of  silence  surrounding  the
issue locks women into abusive relationship, provides perpetrators  with  an
excuse for the continuation of violent behaviour and allows  communities  to
deny the existence of violence against women.

Despite the progressive changes of the last eight  years,  for  millions  of
South African women the realities of their  daily  lives  remain  unchanged.
Incidents of domestic violence, rape and femicide are escalating.

Firstly, I want to compliment the office of the Status of Women,  nationally
as well as provincially, the Joint Monitoring Committee on  the  Improvement
of Quality of Life and Status of Women and all the role-players for such  an
indepth report regarding violence against women.

Ek  hoop  van  harte  dat  al  die  betrokke  departemente  hierdie  verslag
bestudeer, en werk maak van die voorstelle wat in die verslag  vervat  word.
Die stryd om geslagsgelykheid is nog nie ten volle geïntegreer as  deel  van
'n oorkoepelende  ontwikkelingsperspektief  nie.  Geslagsgelykheid  sal  nie
bereik word sonder om aandag te skenk aan ongelykhede oor die  spektrum  van
huidige sosio-ekonomiese toestande nie.  Armoede,  werkloosheid,  behuising,
maatskaplike dienste, opleiding en ontwikkeling moet alles aandag geniet  om
werklik substansiële gelykheid vir vroue teweeg te bring. Geweld teen  vroue
is ook steeds 'n groot struikelblok in die weg van werklike gelykheid.

Ons moet kyk na sekere kwessies rakende opheffing om die  omstandighede  van
vroue te verbeter,  en  om  hulle  te  bemagtig.  Ons  moet  'n  uitgebreide
openbare bewusmakingsveldtog loods in alle tale deur  die  gebruik  van  die
elektroniese en gedrukte media oor die reg van vroue  om  vry  te  wees  van
geweld. So 'n veldtog moet gerig word op beide vroue en mans,  en  moet  ook
op die landelike gebiede gemik wees. Dit moet ook maklik toeganklik wees.

Dit is  noodsaaklik  dat  gemeenskapsorganisasies,  veral  kerkorganisasies,
deurentyd betrokke sal wees by die veldtog, en dat invloedryke mense in  die
gemeenskap,    insluitende    politici,    kerkleiers,     sakeleiers     en
jeugorganisasies hulle op  nasionale,  provinsiale  en  plaaslike  vlak  ter
ondersteuning van die veldtog sal uitdruk. Daar  moet  behoorlike  opvoeding
wees oor seks, seksuele gesondheid, die misdaad van  geweld  teen  vroue  en
alternatiewe meganismes om konflik op te los. Dit moet  deel  wees  van  die
skoolleerplan wat van 'n geskikte jong ouderdom  af  aangebied  word.  Sulke
programme moet ook fokus op  die  ontwikkeling  van  selfstandigheid  en  'n
goeie selfbeeld vir seuns en dogters.

Daar moet aandag geskenk word aan die opleiding van onderwysers om seker  te
maak dat onderwysers voel hulle is toegerus om hierdie  soort  opleiding  te
bied. Daar moet ook opleiding wees  vir  ouers  deur  middel  van  nasionale
werksessies en opleidingseminare oor ouerskapvaardighede.  Die  ouerhuis  is
die belangrikste instrument om die regte klimaat  te  skep.  Opvoeding  moet
beskikbaar gestel word vir mans deur  middel  van  werknemerorganisasies  en
vakbonde. Hoë prioriteit moet verleen word aan die verandering van  mans  se
persepsies as een van die belangrikste kwessies.

Voorsiening moet gemaak word vir primêre,  sowel  as  sekondêre  voorkoming,
byvoorbeeld voorligtingsprogramme vir  mishandelaars  in  gemeenskappe  deur
verteenwoordigers  van  die  polisie,  welsynsdienste  en  regsdienste   wat
gebruik maak van die netwerke van soveel  gemeenskapsorganisasies  moontlik,
insluitende vroue organisasies. Sulke programme moet veral gebruik  word  om
vroue te bereik wat reeds die skool verlaat het,  asook  mans  wat  werkloos
is.

'n Uitgebreide opleidingsprogram moet deur die Departement  van  Welsyn  vir
sy amptenare van stapel gestuur word om hulle toe te rus om  met  vroue  wat
geweld  teen  hulle  oorleef  het  te  werk.  Die  Regering,  sowel  as  die
burgerlike samelewing, moet dringend aandag  skenk  aan  die  oprigting  van
skuilings vir vroue wat mishandel is.  Dit  is  ook  'n  projek  waarin  die
private sektor 'n  spesifieke  bydrae,  wat  uiters  nodig  is,  kan  lewer,
naamlik om vroue te help om hulself en hul kinders  uit  geweldsituasies  te
kan verwyder. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I hope with all my heart that all the departments involved will study  this
report, and put into effect the suggestions that  are  encapsulated  in  the
report. The struggle for sexual equality has not yet been  fully  integrated
as part of an overarching development perspective. Sexual equality will  not
be reached without paying attention to inequalities across the  spectrum  of
current socioeconomic conditions.  Poverty,  unemployment,  housing,  social
services, training and development should all enjoy attention to  result  in
true substantial equality for women. Violence against women also remains  an
important stumbling block in the way of true equality.

We should look at certain issues  relating  to  upliftment  to  improve  the
circumstances of women, and to empower them. We should  launch  an  extended
public awareness  campaign,  in  all  languages,  by  using  electronic  and
printed media, on the right of women  to  be  free  from  violence.  Such  a
campaign should target both men and women,  and  should  also  be  aimed  at
rural areas. It should also be easily accessible.
It  is   necessary   that   community   organisations,   especially   church
organisations, should be continually involved  in  the  campaign,  and  that
influential people in the community, including politicians, church  leaders,
business leaders and youth organisations express themselves to be in  favour
of the campaign at national, provincial, and  local  level.  There  must  be
proper education about sex, sexual health, the  crime  of  violence  against
women and alternative mechanisms to resolve conflict. It should  be  a  part
of the school curriculum from a suitably young age. Such  programmes  should
also focus on the development of independence  and  a  good  self-image  for
boys and girls.

Attention should be devoted to the  training  of  teachers  to  ensure  that
teachers feel they are prepared to present  this  kind  of  training.  There
must also be training for parents through national  workshops  and  training
seminars in parenting skills.  The  parental  home  is  the  most  important
instrument in creating the right climate. Training must  be  made  available
for men through employer organisations and trade unions. High priority  must
be given to changing men's perceptions as one of the most important issues.

Provision must be made for primary, as well  as  secondary  prevention,  for
example   counselling   programmes   for   abusers   in    communities    by
representatives of the police, social services and legal  services  who  use
the networks of as  many  community  organisations  as  possible,  including
women's organisations. Such programmes  should  be  used  in  particular  to
reach  women  who  have  already  left  school,  as  well  as  men  who  are
unemployed.

An extensive training programme must be launched for its  officials  by  the
Department of Social Development in order to equip  them  for  dealing  with
women who have survived violence against them. The Government,  as  well  as
civil society, should urgently look into to the  establishment  of  shelters
for women who have been abused. It is also a project in  which  the  private
sector can make a  specific  contribution,  which  is  extremely  necessary,
namely  to  help  women  to  remove  themselves  and  their  children   from
situations of violence.]

Many more women's groups in the form of NGOs and CBOs  were  visibly  giving
women the opportunity to develop their leadership  skills  and  engage  with
the transformation process.

History has proven  that  women  have  played  and  will  continue  to  play
important roles in society, for example they were the ones who  successfully
fought against pass laws - the beginning of the struggle  against  apartheid
- and whose victories  in  this  struggle  are  now  enjoyed  by  all  South
Africans, if we take an example like you Chairperson. It  is  now  the  time
that they, in greater numbers, take  their  rightful  place  alongside  men.
Violence against women needs to be recognised as an issue  of  great  public
concern in order to break down people's tolerance of violence.

In conclusion, I hope that this report will urge everybody to take  positive
steps to contribute towards the elimination of violence against women.  Only
by working towards ending violence against women can South  Africans  ensure
that women function as fully equal citizens who can enjoy  their  rights  as
guaranteed by the Constitution. [Applause.]

Ms  N  P  NKONYENI:  Hon  Chairperson  and  hon  members  of  this  Chamber,
sanibonani. [Interjections.] When the cadres and  freedom  fighters  of  the
ANC deliberated in 1956, they came up with a document that we  all  respect,
namely, the Freedom Charter. The very last clause of  that  document  reads:
``There shall be peace and prosperity.''

The struggle continued, women and men fighting side  by  side  in  order  to
achieve democracy that everyone is enjoying  today.  Yes,  South  Africa  is
free  from  the  apartheid  regime.  Yes,  equality  is  enshrined  in   our
Constitution. But, unfortunately, the struggle continues for  women  because
some are still  experiencing  discrimination  and  gender-related  violence.
They are still discriminated against in the workplace, in  their  homes,  in
decision-making and other areas. The struggle against  patriarchy  and  male
chauvinism continues.
Firstly, I would like to declare to this House that  at  last  the  KwaZulu-
Natal provincial legislature has established a committee similar to the  JMC
which is called The Standing Committee on the Improvement of the Quality  of
Life and Status of Women.  So,  the  parliamentary  women's  caucus  of  our
provincial legislature really deserves a big round  of  applause  for  their
concerted efforts and  enthusiasm  to  ensure  that  the  provincial  gender
machinery is in place and is functioning. [Applause.]

Secondly,  members  of  the  women's  caucus  have  successfully  eradicated
patriarchy by mainstreaming gender equality and equity through the minds  of
all the male legislators from the Premier to the  ordinary  member  of  that
legislature. [Applause.]

If one could peruse through the budget statements of all  departments,  each
MEC would make a declaration on how much is set aside  for  the  improvement
of the quality of life and status of women. [Applause.] Of course, no  woman
is deployed to the executive council as yet, but we are still  fighting  for
that.

It is with great regret  that  in  KZN  in  some  areas  we  still  practise
ukuhlolwa  kwezintombi  [virginity  testing]  on  girl   children.   It   is
unfortunate that this kind of violence is  perpetrated  by  women  on  other
women. Of course, there are two sides of the coin.  Yes,  maybe  during  our
times when I was still a teenager, that custom  might  have  been  relevant,
especially because I was ignorant and it was the order of the day.  But,  is
it not a discriminatory kind of custom?

Khona  manje,  kunenkoloze  ekhona  lapha  emphakathini  ethi   uma   indoda
enegciwane  lengculazi  idlwengula  umntwana  wentombazana  oyintombi   nto,
iyaphela ingculazi kuyo.  Lokho-ke  sekwenze  ukuthi  izinga  lokudlwengulwa
kwabantwana lenyuke kakhulu.

Nawo amasiko akufanele abandlulule ngokobulili. Yiziphi  izinhlelo  ezikhona
zokubhekela  ukuthi  abafana   nabo   bayaqeqeshwa   ngokuziphatha?   Nakuba
sivumelana ngokuthi kufanele sithuthukise amasiko  ethu,  mina  ngithi  nawo
amasiko kumele acutshungulwe kahle ukuthi awabandlululi na.

Abantu bayadlwengulwa. Namanje sikhuluma nje kukhona  abadlwengulayo.  Kubi-
ke ngoba kuyaye kuthi noma  abadlwenguliwe  beyobika  emaphoyiseni,  babuzwe
imibuzo engenasidingo neyehlisa isithunzi somuntu  wesifazane,  njengokuthi:
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Currently there is this superstition among  communities  that  if  an  HIV-
positive man rapes a virgin, he is cured of HIV. As a result  of  this,  the
rate of child rape has increased.

Customs should not discriminate in terms  of  gender.  For  instance,  which
programmes are there to provide for the moral training of boys? Although  we
agree that we need to develop our customs, personally I  feel  that  customs
themselves need to be scrutinised as to whether they are  discriminatory  or
not.

People are raped. Even at this  very  moment  there  are  people  committing
rape. It is unfortunate that when people who have been raped, when  they  go
and  report  it  to  the  police,  are  asked  unnecessary  and  humiliating
questions.]

Did you enjoy? Did you ejaculate as well? What was the length of your  skirt
or dress? This ridicules  them  and  thereafter  they  fail  to  bring  that
perpetrator of sexual violence to book.

We,  therefore,  call  upon  the  departments  responsible  for  safety  and
security and our judiciary to ensure that police officials, prosecutors  and
magistrates undergo extensive training on the collection  of  evidence,  the
presentation  of  DNA  evidence  and   on   cross-examination   skills   and
sensitivity in dealing with witnesses, and on the  proper  framing  of  age-
appropriate questions. When the women's caucus in KZN decided to  visit  the
women's shelters in our province, we realised that they are all situated  in
and around the cities. There are no  shelters  for  abused  women  in  rural
areas. We therefore call upon the Department of Social Welfare to  establish
women's shelters in rural areas as well, and to provide  extensive  training
to its officials in order to equip them to deal  with  survivors  of  gender
violence,  and  also  with  skills  that  would  eradicate  dependency   and
subordination among survivors of gender violence.

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate  the  members  of  the  JMC  for
their efforts to develop this kind of an informative  report,  and  also  to
say: As long as women and girls are  still  discriminated  against  and  are
still victimised, the struggle continues. [Applause.]

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, toe my medepartygenote gehoor het  ek  moet  oor
dié onderwerp praat, het hulle met my gespot en gesê: Jy  moet  net  hierdie
vraag beantwoord: Slaan jy nog steeds jou vrou? [Gelag.] Dit is 'n  moeilike
vraag,  want  sê  'n  mens  ``ja'',  dan  beteken  dit  jy  oortree  hierdie
wetgewing, jy pleeg geweld teen 'n vrou, maar sê  jy  ``nee'',  dan  beteken
dit jy het dit in die verlede gedoen. Dit is dus 'n vraag wat moeilik is  om
te beantwoord en  ek  wil  dit  liewer  systap  en  konsentreer  op  hierdie
verslag.  Op  'n  ernstiger  noot:  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, when my fellow party members heard that  I  had
to speak about this subject they made fun of me and said: You just  have  to
answer this question: Are you still hitting your wife? [Laughter.] It  is  a
difficult question, because if one says ``yes'' it  means  that  one  is  in
contravention of this legislation, one  is  committing  violence  against  a
woman, but if one says ``no'' it means that one used to do it in  the  past.
It is therefore a question that is difficult to answer, and I  would  rather
sidestep it and concentrate on this report. On a more serious note.]

The DP and the DA appreciate the very comprehensive and detailed  report  by
the Joint Monitoring Committee on Violence against Women. In  my  speech  on
this report, I will  briefly  refer  to  the  recent  research  on  violence
against women, HIV/Aids and violence  against  women,  legislation  that  we
have regarding violence against women, and the recommendations by the  Joint
Monitoring Committee on Violence against Women, and then I will conclude.

Unisa's Institute  for  Social  and  Health  Sciences  recently  produced  a
research report on violence against women. It was based on  rape  statistics
gathered by district surgeons in Johannesburg from January 1996 to  December
1998. Some of their findings, on an analysis of 1 401  rape  cases  reported
at the Hillbrow, Lenasia  South  and  Chris  Hani-Baragwanath  medical-legal
clinics during the period were the following - it is the  Gauteng  situation
that I am referring to, as it is the province that  I  represent.  Fifty-one
percent of survivors were between the ages of 15 and 25,  80%  of  survivors
were African, 10,2% coloured, 8,1% white and 1,8% Asian. Eighty three  comma
three percent rapes were perpetrated by a person from the same racial  group
as the survivor. Fifty eight comma two percent of rapes  occurred  over  the
weekend, while 44,7% of survivors were acquainted  with  their  attacker  in
some way. Younger victims were more likely to know their  attackers.  Thirty
one percent of rapes were committed  in  open  fields,  73%  of  rapes  were
committed by a single  perpetrator,  and  where  a  single  perpetrator  was
involved, 51,5% of perpetrators were known to their victims. Where  multiple
attackers were involved, 75,1% of the perpetrators  were  strangers  to  the
victims. Weapons were used in 54,9%  of  the  attacks.  The  statistics  are
devastating.

A further aggravating circumstance is of course HIV/Aids and  the  influence
that it has on violence against women. Women and children who have been  the
victims of sexual abuse and  violence  face  special  risks  of  contracting
sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV/Aids.

The violence and coercion involved in the sexual relationships  of  so  many
men and women in South Africa, limit  especially  the  capacities  of  young
women to protect themselves against HIV  and  Aids.  In  research  conducted
among women in three South African provinces, the CERSA reported  that  many
women indicated that their  partner  openly  brought  girlfriends  home,  or
boasted about them. Even more women indicated that  they  did  not  perceive
that they were able to refuse sex with their husbands.

Given the pattern of gender relations described  in  this  research,  it  is
likely that women are not in a position to insist on  condom  use,  even  if
they wanted to. In a relationship characterised by  physical  violence  they
would only face further abuse.

Various perverse myths, connecting sex and certain types  of  women  with  a
cure for Aids, have  arisen  during  the  last  decade.  This  added  a  new
dimension to sexual violence against women. In  1990  a  document  appeared,
calling on African men in the Durban area to acquire the  Aids  antibody  by
raping Indian women. Even though the flier was believed  to  have  been  the
work of a third force, intent on aggravating conflict in and  between  black
communities, it still succeeded in  increasing  the  fears  surrounding  the
disease. There is also the well-circulated  myth  that  sex  with  a  child-
virgin will cure a person of the virus.

A further aggravating problem regarding HIV/Aids is  the  Government  policy
on the pandemic. The antiretroviral drugs are not available  throughout  the
country as of today. We have  two  different  laws  on  the  elimination  of
violence against women: the Domestic Violence  Act,  Act  No  116  of  1998,
which repeals some sections of the Prevention of Family  Violence  Act,  Act
No 133 of 1993; and the Criminal Procedure Act which limits the granting  of
bail to persons accused of committing serious offences which  include  rape,
and which also makes provision for minimum sentences  for  murder  and  rape
with aggravating circumstances.

I would like to look at the recommendations made  by  the  joint  monitoring
committee. The DP strongly subscribes to  all  these  recommendations.  They
are the following: The availability of access to legal aid to women who  are
victims of violence must be given urgent consideration by  the  stakeholders
concerned, and urgent attention must be given to  increasing  staff  in  key
departments that work on gender-based violence.

Both Government  and  civil  society  must  give  urgent  attention  to  the
establishment of shelters for abused women. This is also a project in  which
the private sector can make a  specific  and  greatly  needed  contribution.
Urgent attention must be given to the availability  of  treatment  of  STDs,
and other health risks, regarding rape survivors. The Department  of  Health
must prioritise establishing  the  effectiveness  of  antiretroviral  drugs,
like AZT, for rape survivors.

An  extensive  public  awareness  campaign  must  be  undertaken,   in   all
languages, through the use of electronic and print media, about  the  rights
of women to be free from violence. Such campaigns must  address  both  women
and men, and must target rural areas in an accessible way. Proper  education
on sex, sexual health, crime  or  violence  against  women  and  alternative
conflict resolution mechanisms, other than violence, must  be  initiated  at
all levels of society. The possibilities of weekend incarceration should  be
investigated, especially for perpetrators of domestic violence.

The DP and the DA  fully  agree  with  these  recommendations  made  by  the
committee. A further recommendation that we want to propose  from  our  side
is that if there are any pamphlets  or  information  brochures  on  violence
against women, it should be made available  to  political  parties.  The  DP
will make these pamphlets available at their constituency  offices,  and  it
will be an enormous aid  in  informing  the  public  on  how  to  cope  with
violence against women.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Honourable Chairperson, hon members, all forms of  violence
against women, be it physical or mental, whether  at  domestic  or  societal
levels,  including  those  arising  form  customs,  traditions  or  accepted
practices, must be dealt with effectively with a  view  to  eliminating  its
incidence. Institutions and mechanisms for assistance are being  created  so
as  to  strengthen  the  prevention  of  such  violence,  including   sexual
harassment  at  work  places,  and  customs  like  dowry  payment,  for  the
rehabilitation of the victims of violence and for  taking  effective  action
against the perpetrators of such violence.
The Department of Safety and  Security  together  with  the  Departments  of
Justice, Correctional Services, Defence and  Social  Development  have  come
together as part  of  the  National  Crime  Prevention  Strategy  to  combat
violence against women. These departments have since  last  year  identified
violence against women as one of the priority crimes. The  police  have  set
themselves the following  goals  in  this  regard:  They  want  to  increase
arrests and prosecutions for sexual and violent  crimes  against  women  and
children; support  and  encourage  victims  and  witnesses  to  report  such
crimes; provide specialised training to police personnel  to  ensure  proper
victim support; increase resources  allocated  to  policing  crimes  against
women and children and develop a policy on dealing with domestic violence.

On the issue of domestic violence, the Act sets out the specific  duties  of
a police official at the scene of  domestic  violence  or  when  a  case  of
domestic violence is reported.  A  police  member  must  do  the  following:
First, the official must determine if the complainant is in any  danger  and
take all reasonable steps to secure the scene and  protect  the  complainant
from further harm. Once the scene has been secured, the  official  must  (a)
render such assistance to the complainant  as  may  reasonably  be  required
under the circumstances, and (b) if it is possible to do so, hand a  written
notice to the complainant and explain his or her rights as set  out  in  the
notice such as, (i) the right to lay a criminal charge; (ii)  the  right  to
apply for a protection order, or (iii) the right to lay  a  criminal  charge
as well as apply for a protection order.

It  is  very  important  that  we  participate  and  encourage   people   to
participate in Community Police Forums  so  that  we  can  hold  the  police
accountable to these objectives. Through  Community  Police  Forums  we  can
also develop a partnership with the police  in  dealing  with  questions  of
family violence and sexual abuse of children.  Our  past  has  succeeded  in
creating a culture of racism, inequality and  discrimination.  In  virtually
all societies and spheres of activity, women were subjected to  inequalities
in law and in fact this situation was both caused  and  exacerbated  by  the
existence of discrimination in the family and  in  the  community  which  in
turn exposed women to violence.

While  causes  and  consequences  may  vary,  violence  against   women   is
widespread.  It  is  perpetuated  by  the  survival   of   stereotypes   and
traditional practices and beliefs detrimental to women. In order to get  rid
of violence against women and children, we need conscious efforts  from  all
sectors of society such as government NGOs, religious  organisations,  civic
organisations and traditional leaders. The violence that women and  children
experience differs from  the  type  of  violence  experienced  by  men.  For
example, women are susceptible to domestic violence and sexual assault in  a
way that men are not. Violence experienced by women is at the hands  of  men
whom they know; the abuser is in their own homes, in most cases.

The link between violence against  women  and  poverty  means  that  African
women, who constitute the poorest sector in South Africa, are at  a  greater
risk of being subjected to violence than any other  group  in  our  society.
According to research in progress, violence against woman is cited  in  over
a third of divorces as the cause  of  the  breakdown  of  the  relationship.
These figures are almost certainly an underestimate of the  true  extent  of
wife battery. Divorce lawyers attest to the fact that some  of  their  women
clients admit to having been battered but do not want  to  include  this  in
their papers. Since South Africa has a no-fault  divorce  system,  there  is
little to be gained in including allegations of battery in the papers.

In conclusion, South  African  women  who  undoubtedly  bore  the  brunt  of
oppression, are at last faced  with  the  prospect  of  fair  treatment  and
indeed, with the prospect of meaningful corrective  action.  Our  Government
has made these possibilities into action.  Few  women  are  aware  that  the
rights enshrined in the Constitution are no longer  paper  guarantees.  What
we need to do is to educate women about  the  effective  mechanisms  of  the
enforcement of policies and legislation  brought  about  by  Government  and
encourage women to  take  concerted  action  and  fight  for  their  rights.

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Sihlalo, isihloko esiphezu kwaso namhlanje asimnandi  neze
kuwo wonke umuntu okhona lapha endlini nolalele le nkulumo.

Ukuhlukunyezwa kwabantu  besifazane  sizwa  ngakho  noma  sikubone  kwenzeka
eduze  kwethu.  Kulichilo  nehlazo.  Siyethemba  ukuthi  ukukhuluma   ngakho
kuyohamba kuhambe kuwenze umehluko. Umuntu  ohlukumeza  owesifazane,  omdala
noma omncane, kudingeka athole isigwebo  esinzima.  Lokho  kufanele  kumenze
esabe ukuqhubeka nodlame analo emndenini. Kanti  uma  elengiselwa  isigwebo,
uthola ithuba lokuba aqhubeke nendluzula yakhe.

Indluzula imikhakha miningi, sebekhulumile  abanye  ngayo  ngaphambi  kwami.
Imvamisa iqala emndenini kumama wekhaya oyaye  azithole  engukudla  kwenduku
ekhaya noma engenze lutho olutheni. Omunye uyathethiswa,  ehliswe  isithunzi
phambi kwabantu naphambi kwezingane.

Siyalincoma iqhaza elibanjwe nguHulumeni ekubhekeleni amalungelo  nesithunzi
somuntu  wesifazane  njengoba  sinamakomiti  anjenge-Status  of  women   no-
Equality, konke lokho mhlawumbe kuyohamba kuhambe njengoba ngishilo.

Owesifazane ohlukunyezwayo ugcina esegula  noma  aze  alahlekelwe  nayimpilo
yakhe. Omunye  kuyaye  kube  sengathi  nekhanda  alisathathi  kahle.  Sivela
esikhathini esihle nokho kakhulu esasimhlonipha umuntu  wesifazane,  endulo.
Owesilisa owayevulela inqindi  kumuntu  wesifazane,  owesifazane  wayemshiya
amuke aye kwabakubo. Abakubo baphindele  naye  ekhaya  ngoba  phela  washada
kuyoxazululwa  inkinga  wumndeni.  Akusekho  lokhu  manje.  Ukuthi  kwaqedwa
ngubani, akekho owaziyo.

Owesifazane ohlukunyezwayo emzini wakhe uthi  noma  eyobika  enkantolo  kube
khona ukuthalalisa nje  aze  aphele  amandla.  Kwesinye  isikhathi  umthetho
umbophe umhlukumezi bese kuba ngowesimame ocela akhishwe ejele  umhlukumezi.
Izinkinga-ke lezi ezibikwa abomthetho uma silandela.

Okubi kakhulu ukuthi udlame  luyakhula  ngoba  manje  abahlukumezi  sebevele
babulale umndeni  wonke.  Uma  kunesivakashi  kulowo  muzi  naso  sife  noma
sithole amachaphazelo. Umthetho kudingeka uqine kakhulu.  Abantu  besifazane
abakwazi  ukubhekana  nodlame,  abadalwanga   bezidlakela   umthetho   wabo.
Abahlukumezi  abagcini  lapho.  Basukela  noma  yimuphi  umuntu   wesifazane
bamphoxe ngokukhuluma kwabo futhi bamehlise isithunzi.

Okubi-ke kunalokho indlela abesifazane abadlwengulwa  ngayo.  Sekukhulunyiwe
kakhulu ngokudlwengula.  Badlwengula  emndenini  nasemphakathini.  Kulukhuni
kakhulu. Kudlwengulwa umntwana omncane ofaka amanabukeni.  Siyizwile  indaba
eyenzeke ngale ko-Northern Cape, kuye esalukazini esidala esihola  impesheni
esingasakwazi nokunyakaza. Umhlola ongakaze uzwakale ngisho nasendulo.

Okunye okuqhubela  phambili  lo  mkhuba  onyanyekayo  wuphuzo  oludakisanayo
nezidakamizwa. Futhi okubi kakhulu  ukuthi  umhlukumezi  uzala  umhlukumezi.
Ziyabukela  phela   izingane.   Abantwana   bayabukela   kwabadala   indlela
yokuziphatha.

Lolu daba lwendluzula kwabesifazane,  kuvele  imibono  eminingi  yokuluqeda.
Abanye bathi umdlwenguli akanqunywe  isitho  sakhe  sobulili.  Ukhona  owake
washo nakhona lapha phakathi kwethu. Abanye bathi akafanele  ukuphila.  Mina
ngokwami  ngithi  umthetho  awuthathe  indawo  yawo,  abadlwenguli   badonse
kakhulu ejele, baphume sebephele amandla  ocansi,  sebevoveke  inkani  futhi
bengasamcabangi nje umuntu wesifazane.

Abanye  abahlolwe  ingqondo.  Uma  begula,  bagcinwe  ezibhedlela   zabagula
ngengqondo isikhathi  eside  nabo  kuze  kuphele  inkanuko  yocansi  nomuntu
wesifazane.  Laba  abadlwengula  abantwana  ngoba  benemfundiso  ze  yokuthi
kuzophela ingculazi, nabo badinga isigwebo  esifanayo.  Thina  be-IFP  sithi
umthetho awuqiniswe nxa zonke, imiphakathi yonke  ifundiswe  ilulekwe  ukuze
kuqedwe lolu  dlame.  Ikomiti  elibhekela  abesifazane  lizilandele  kakhulu
izifundazwe,  kwenziwe  ucwaningo  olunzulu  ngalokhu  ngoba  bakhona  omama
abathulayo bebona. Masibhukule silwe nalolu dlame.

Omame abanye bayanyamezela noma bazi ukuthi ubaba wekhaya ubuye  ahwaphilize
izingane. Kukhona indaba  esemaphepheni  lapho  kukhona  izingane  ezintathu
ezizale izingane zizaliswa uyise.  Manje  seziyagula  ngengqondo,  ziyakhala
ziyachiphiza ngoba izingane uma zibuzwa ukuthi ubaba wengane  ubani,  izothi
ubani ubaba? Zingane zakwethu kulukhuni!  Okusho  ukuthi  kufuneka  ngempela
sikhulume kuchitheke gula linamasi.  (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, the subject that we are discussing today  is
not interesting at all to everyone who is  present  and  listening  in  this
House.

We hear about or see the abuse of women abuse around us. It is  a  disgrace.
We hope that talking about it will someday make a difference. A  person  who
abuses women, old or young, should be given a heavy sentence. This  sentence
should stop his violent behaviour towards his family. But  if  a  person  is
given  parole,  he  gets  an  opportunity  to  continue  with  his   violent
behaviour.

Violence comes in various forms, and some  members  have  talked  about  it.
Generally it starts with the family, where  the  wife  finds  herself  being
beaten without any good reason. Some women are shouted at and humiliated  in
front of people and children.

We commend the Government's role in protecting  the  rights  of  women,  for
example, restoring the dignity of women as we have committees  such  as  the
one on the status of women and their equality. Maybe all this will help,  as
I have mentioned, to stop the violence against women and children.

An abused woman usually ends up sick, or even loses her life, or looks  like
someone who has lost her mind. We reminisce about the good times when  women
were respected. A woman would leave a violent  husband  and  return  to  her
family. The family would take her back to her husband's family so that  both
families could try to resolve the problem. This  does  not  happen  anymore,
and we do not know who stopped it.

When an abused woman reports to a court that she is being  abused  at  home,
her case is sometimes not given the attention it  deserves,  and  the  woman
despairs. In some instances the abuser is  arrested,  and  it  will  be  the
woman who asks for the abuser to  be  released  from  jail.  These  are  the
problems that are reported by law enforcement officers when we follow up  on
these issues.

The most terrible thing is that violence is increasing, as abusers  tend  to
murder the whole family. If there is a visitor during  that  period,  he  or
she is also killed or affected by this.  The  law  should  be  very  strict.
Women cannot stand violence; they were not made as  powerfully  as  muscular
men. Abusers are never satisfied, they insult and  humiliate  women  by  the
manner in which they speak.

Worse than this is the rate at which women are being abused. This  has  been
discussed intensively. Rapists are raping  members  of  their  families  and
communities. This is a difficult situation. Babies  that  wear  nappies  are
being raped. We have heard about what happened in the Northern Cape  and  to
an old woman who is a pensioner and can hardly move. This is  shocking,  and
this never used to happen in the olden days.

Drug and alcohol abuse are some of the reasons that lead to such  disgusting
behaviour. What is bad about this is that  the  abuser  always  produces  an
abuser. Children learn from adults how to behave themselves.

There are so many suggestions that have been made to stop  violence  against
women. Some people suggest that a rapist should be castrated. This was  once
raised even in this House. Some people say that a rapist  does  not  deserve
to live, but I think the law should  take  its  course.  Rapists  should  be
heavily sentenced and when they come out of prison,  they  should  not  have
any desire for sex. They should not even be thinking about a woman.

Some of these rapists need psychological examination. Should they  be  sick,
they need to be  institutionalised  for  a  long  time  so  that  they  lose
interest in having sex with women. Those people who rape children  with  the
misconception that having sex with a child cures HIV/Aids require  the  same
sentence.

We as the IFP say that the law should be  reinforced  in  every  sense,  and
communities should be taught and advised so that  this  violence  can  stop.
The committee that is working with women's issues  is  mostly  working  with
the provinces. Research has been conducted  on  this  subject,  and  it  was
found that some women keep quiet  even  when  they  are  aware  of  what  is
happening. Let us stand up and fight this violence.

Some women turn a blind eye even when they are  aware  that  their  husbands
sometimes abuse the children sexually. There is a story  that  has  been  in
the newspapers recently about girls who were  impregnated  by  their  father
and gave birth. They are now psychologically  disturbed.  They  are  crying,
because they do not know who to say is the father of the children.  Who  can
they say is the father of the children? Brothers  and  sisters,  this  is  a
difficult situation! We should talk until this problem is resolved.]
Maybe I just want to correct the perception. [Time expired.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Mgcinisihlalo lohlon, ngiyabonga kutsi nami,  njengababe,
ngitfole  litfuba  lekubeka  luvo  lwami  ngaloludlame   lolwentiwa   bobabe

Ngiyetsemba  kutsi  sonkhe  nasingaphendvula   lowo   mbuto   ngekwetsembeka

concerned.)
Kodvwa-ke, ngingaze ngimoshe lamaminithi likhadi  lami  lelinginikete  wona,
nginemaminithi lasiphohlongo. Ngako-ke ngitawuhlabela  embili.  (Translation
of Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson, I am so grateful to have this  opportunity,
as a father, to voice my ideas concerning the violence that  is  perpetrated
by husbands against their wives. I am also grateful that some of  the  other
men have also taken part in  this  debate.  I  was  very  impressed  by  the
speeches made by both Mr Adams and Mr Theron, but  I  nevertheless  did  not
get his reply clearly, because he failed to  give  a  clear  answer  to  the
question that was put to him; that was whether  he  was  still  abusing  his
wife at home or not. [Laughter.]

I hope that we as fathers can answer that  question  honestly,  starting  at
this House and moving to our communities, so that there could be a  tangible
change in our communities. It also concerns me to see  other  organisations,
like the UCDP and the UDM, and people  like  Mr  Tlhagale  and  Mr  Nyakane,
being so quiet about this. I keep on asking myself questions; what  do  they
say regarding this violence by our fathers against our mothers?  The  saying
goes: Silence is concerned.]

What can she do if he comes home drunk, kicking in the  door,  the  children
and everything has gone mad? When she is sleeping he turns up the music  and
comes to her and makes her sleep with him. She  only  wants  to  please  her
husband but she does not like it. He is very aggressive in  their  bed.  She
does not believe it is really rape when it is her husband. Neither does  he.
He says that she is his wife and he can do with her whatever  he  wants  to.
Even if she says no, her husband gets cross and hits  her  and  keeps  doing
what he wants to do to her.

It is very painful, but she cannot scream  because  her  children  are  also
there. That is why he turns on the music. She says her  children  know  what
is happening. She can hear them cry. She reports  him  to  his  family.  His
family asks her what is wrong with her that she does not want to please  her
husband, or what are they supposed to do.  She  should  have  sex  with  her
husband.

This is not a fairy tale. This is reality.  It  is  a  practical  experience
which not only hundreds, but thousands of women in this country go  through.
[Laughter.] It is very disturbing that some members  are  laughing  when  we
reflect on this, probably because they do  not  experience  the  pain  those
poor women experience. It may be  the  same  attitude  which  the  policeman
behind the desk has when a woman comes in crying to report such a case.

What are the results? Is it because women particularly in rural  areas  have
little option but to remain in the homes of their offenders?  There  are  no
accessible safe houses or shelters. Women in rural areas remain  in  abusive
relationships because they have little  access  to  economic  resources  and
thus they are dependent on men.

This  physical  violence  often  continues   even   during   pregnancy   and
constitutes an important cause of reproductive morbidity. We may go  on  and
on highlighting some of these things. Some will think  it  only  happens  in
the squatter camps or in the informal settlements or  that  it  is  done  by
people who are not working or who are unemployed or criminals. If  one  buys
this week's edition of Drum magazine, one will read about an  eighteen  year
old girl. She was kidnapped by a multimillionaire and kept as a sex slave.

Lebengifuna kukusho, labanyenti sebakubekile lapha emkhatsini  wetfu,  kutsi
kufanele silivume lelivangeli lekutsi indvuku ayiwakhi umuti.  Natsi  bobabe
silishumayele. Nasingase sihlale phansi sibutane, bakhona labangavuma  kutsi
nabo bakhulela emakhaya lapho khona indvuku yayibhadla kunina.  Nasingahlala
lapha sitibute kutsi kute yini tihlobo nome bangani babo labasakwenta  loku,
ungakhandza kutsi yintfo leyentekako.

Loko ngulokunye futsi, ngobe  kutsiwa  umuntfu  ucala  ngekuhlumisa  likhaya
kakubo. (Charity begins at home.) Loku ngiko lokubangela kutsi  labantfwana,
lesitukulwane lesikhona nyalo, sibe  naloludlame  lolungaka.  Sizatfu  kutsi
balufundza lapha emakhaya.
Kubalulekile kutsi  silucedze  lapha  emakhaya  kucala.  Kulesinye  sikhatsi
siyaye sikhohlisane sodvwa tsine  sibobabe.  Sitsi  nasihleli  sitikhulumela
sicoca, sisemabholeni nome sinatsa tjwala, uve umuntfu atsi:  ``Mine  umfati
ngeke angitjele lutfo, nangifika ngifuna  kudla  lokufutfumele.''  Lomake-ke
kufuneka ahlale alindzile, kantsi  awukamtsengeli  ne-microwave.  Sekufanele
ahlale-ke aphe kuvutsela umlilo kutsi alindze kutsi  aze  babe  afike,  nome
ufika ekuseni ngabo 2:00, kumele atfole kudla kufutfumele.

Ngaleso  sikhatsi  babe  wakhona  unatsile  uhlabela  ingoma  utsi:  ``Ngeke
ngilale ngingacabulanga,'' kani usho  kutsi  uyawubanga  ludlame  le  ekhaya
kulabomake. [Luhleko.] Loko yintfo lekufuneka siyicedza ikhawule itsi mfo!

Kunalenye indzaba  leyase  yenteka  ngale  ngakitsi  leyashiya  tintsandzane

Nakatsi uyefika wakhandza  make  atiphekele  liklabishi.  Kwasha  sibhakela,
ngalokunatsa kwakhe, wagcina asakhiphe sibhamu wabulala lomake.

Watsi kube abone kutsi  sewente  lowo  mhlolo  lowo  watidubula  naye  wafa.
Bantfwana  basala  sebahlupheka  ngobe  sebatintsandzane.  Loko   ngulokunye
lokwentiwa  nguloludlame  lolwenteka  ekhatsi  emakhaya.  Ngilo  lolubangele
kutsi kube netinkinga letigcina setitinkinga temphakatsi wonkhe  ngobe  labo
bantfwana nabasele batintsandzane sebasalele bani? (Translation  of  Siswati
paragraphs follows.)

[What I want to say is what many hon members  have  already  alluded  to  in
this House. The fact is that we have to acknowledge the gospel that  says  a
home was not built by a stick. We as fathers should go out and  preach  that
gospel. If we were to sit down and ask one another  about  our  backgrounds,
some among us could confess that they also grew up in  violent  homes  where
their mothers were beaten by their fathers. If we may ask whether there  are
friends and relatives of some of us who are  still  doing  that,  one  would
find that this is what is happening.
One of the things that is said is that charity begins at home. That is  what
actually causes the youth, the present generation, to  be  so  violent.  The
reason is that they learnt that in their homes.

It is very important to uproot it at home base first. Sometimes  we  fathers
deceive one other. When we sit together  amongst  bottles  or  are  drinking
beer, one would hear someone saying: ``My wife would never order  me  around
about anything! When I come home, it does not matter when, I only want  warm
food!'' Which means the woman has to wait  and  the  husband  has  not  even
bought her a microwave in which to heat up the food.  So  the  wife  has  to
wait and keep on blowing the fire to  keep  it  burning  until  her  husband
arrives; even if he comes home at 02:00 in the morning, he still has to  get
warm food!

At the same time, the husband is drunk and singing the song:  ``I  will  not
sleep before I kiss and make love'', when in actual  fact  he  means  he  is
going to perpetrate violence on his  wife.  [Laughter.]  We  must  eradicate
that kind of behaviour at its fountainhead!

There is another event that took place in my community which  left  orphans.
The husband came home very drunk,  and  just  because  he  had  bought  some
hooves, he expected the wife  to  have  cooked  those  hooves.  However,  he
arrived and found that the wife had prepared cabbage. He  did  not  ask  any
questions, he rained blows on her with his fists and,  being  so  drunk,  he
then pulled out his gun and shot dead his wife.

When he realised what he had done, he turned the gun on himself  and  killed
himself. The children were left in great despair and a state  of  starvation
because they were then orphaned by their own father.  That  is  one  of  the
things that is caused by the violence which is  going  on  in  these  homes.
Violence is the cause of all these problems  that  end  up  being  community
problems, because once those children were  left  behind  as  orphans,  they
became a community problem, because whose responsibility could they be?]
As I said, I will be brief. I have  just  a  few  recommendations  to  make.
There is great work which was started ... [Time expired.][Applause.]

Mnu H T  SOGONI:  Sekela-sihlalo  namalungu  abekekileyo  ale  Ndlu  yowiso-
mthetho, ndivumeleni ndiqale ndilungise  impazamana  encinane  nje  eyenziwe
ngugxa okaWindvoel, xa esithi i-UDM ithe cwaka ayenzi nto. Nam  ndiphakamela
ukuzeka  emzekweni,  ndigadlele  phantsi  kwale  ngongoma  siohantsi   kwayo
namhlanje.

Sekela-sihlalo ndivumele ndicaphule kuqala amazwi echule lokuthetha,  amazwi
enye yeengcali zamasiko nentlalo yabantu abantsundu, uKhaba  umfo  kaMkhize,
xa esithi ikhona  imfihlo  esingayiqondi  kahle  ngabafazi  emhlabeni  thina
zizukulwana zanamhlanje. Bakhulu laba bantu kanti  nobuntu  kubuzwa  kubona.
Xa eqhubeka nenqaku  lakhe  phantsi  kwengongoma  ethi  inzala-bantu  idinga
intlonipho,  uphinda  asiyale  enjenjenje,  uma  ihloni   lisuka   endaweni,
kuzalela ihlazo. Ndiwacaphula  nje  la  mazwi  ale  ngqondi,  Sekela-sihlalo
kungenxa  yokuba,   nabanina   ongowasebuhlanti,   ndixela   amadoda,   othe
wawucudisisa umongo  wale  ngxelo  siyivayo  namhlanje,  uziva  esehlazweni.
Gxebe   isithozela   sethu    singamadoda    sibonakala    sisemngciphekweni
wokujongelwa  phantsi  ngenxa  yesikizi  nenyala  okanye  ngenxa   yempatho-
gadalala  eyenziwa   ngamanye   amadoda   kwabasetyhini.   Ngokwengxelo   le
siyiphetheyo Sekela-sihlalo,  iphuhlile  eyokuba  amanye  amadoda  aphelelwa
kukuhlonipha  ubuntu   nesidima   sababhinqileyo   kuze   kulandele   izenzo
ezilihlazo ezihambisa umzimba. Uphando olwenziweyo luyangqina phofu  ngoluvo
oluthi  likho  noko  ibathwana  lamadoda  nalo  elingcungcuthekayo   phantsi
kwesandla  esilukhuni  sabafazi.  Kambe   ke   elo   nani   lawo   alinakude
lithelekiswe  nentlungu  yabafazi  abaphila   ubomi   bentshontsho   phantsi
kwesandla samadoda athile.

Ngokwamanani esinawo, mnye  kwabane  owasetyhini  ophethwe  kakubi  ngumyeni
wakhe ngeveki. Amashumi  asibhozo  ekhulwini  empatho-gadalala  amakhosikazi
athi ayifumane, ayifumana kanye  emizini  yawo  phantsi  kwesandla  sabayeni
ababefungile bathi bayabathanda. Amakhosikazi aliqela ayakwazi  ukunyamezela
intlalo-mbi ngaphezu kweshumi  leminyaka  phambi  kokuba  acinge  ngokushiya
emzini.  Amanye  akwaliqela  ayakwazi  ukunyamezela   ukumbokrwa   ngabayeni
amatyeli angaphezulu kwamashumi  amathathu  anethoba  phambi  kokuba  acinge
ngokucela uncedo.  Maxa  wambi  kude  kubekho  nemeko-ngqondo  yamakhosikazi
aphila le mpilo yosizi ebizwa ngokuba yi "battered women sydrome".  Ayakhula
amanye amakhosikazi ade ayamkele into yokuba awanakuze abe sayinceda  nganto
le meko akuyo. Maxa wambi de azixelele ukuba  ngawo  asisizathu  sale  meko.
Maxa wambi la maxhoba  akholelwa  ukuba  indoda  inamandla  namagunya  phezu
kwayo nkqu nomthetho awunakuba salamla nto  kwesi  sishiqi.  Yiloo  meko  ke
ibuhlungu ede ifikelele kwamanye amakhosikazi aphila ngeli xesha.

Umbuzo oyintloko, Sihlalo emasifune  impendulo  yawo  sonke  uthi:  Konakele
phi?  Kungani  umgangatho   wobuntu   usiya   utshabalala   nje,   uzimisele
ubulwanyana  nentswela-lusizi   kangakanana   esizweni?   Zininzi   izizathu
ezinikwayo ukuzama ukufumana unobangela  wale  meko  igqubayo.  Bambi  bath'
amadoda afuna ukuzibonakalisa ukuba  ngawo  anamandla  nolawulo  emtshatweni
okanye kwimeko yokuthandana  kwabo  bangekatshati.  Bambi  bakholelwa  ukuba
udlomdlayo nezinye iziphithikezi ngqondo  zinegalelo  elivakalayo  ekwenzeni
amadoda  athile   angalawuleki.   Ikho   nenkolelo   ethi   isikhwele   naso

(Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Mr H T SOGONI: Deputy Chairperson and hon members  of  this  House,  please
allow me first to rectify the mistake that  was  made  by  my  colleague  Mr
Windvoël, when he said that the UDM was idle. I rise to add a few  words  on
the topic that we are discussing here today.

Chairperson, you will allow me to quote the words of one of the  experts  on
African culture, Mr Khaba Mkhize, where he  says  that  there  is  a  secret
about women that we, as today's generation, know about:  ``These  are  great
and humane people''. He goes on and tells us that women deserve respect  and
should be treated with dignity. He goes on and  warns  us  when  one  is  no
longer ashamed of anything, disgrace creeps in.

I quote this wise man's words because every man that  has  looked  carefully
at the report that is tabled before us here  today  should  be  ashamed.  In
actual fact our dignity as men is running the  risk  of  being  looked  down
upon because of the shame it brings to  society  because  of  the  crime  of
abuse of women by some men. According to the  report  it  has  become  clear
that some men have lost the respect of human  nature  especially,  and  that
results in their perpetrating serious and shameful acts.  Research  recently
conducted indicates that there are men who are also abused  by  women.  Even
so, their numbers can never be compared to the pain with  which  women  live
under the cruel hands of some men.

Statistics show that one in every four women suffer abuse and violence  from
their husbands every week. Eighty percent  of  abused  cases  of  women  are
domestic cases that are perpetrated by husbands  who  had  sworn  that  they
loved their partners. With some women it may take ten years to  realise  and
accept that she is being abused and can no  longer  stay  in  the  marriage.
Some stay for more than 39 years, suffering abuse and beatings  by  husbands
before they decide to summon help. Sometimes their situation  develops  into
what is called the  ``battered  woman  syndrome''.  Some  believe  that  the
situation they live in can never be changed. Sometimes a  woman  would  even
tells herself that she might be the cause  of  the  abuse.  Sometimes  these
victims believe, and wrongly so, that the man has  control  and  power  over
her and even the law would not be able to stop the situation.  That  is  the
extent of the problem in our society nowadays.

The big question then, Deputy Chairperson is: Where has it gone  wrong?  Why
is  the  standard  of  humanity  going  down?  Why  are  people   conducting
themselves like animals and have no shame in our  country?  There  are  many
reasons that are given for this situation.  Some  claim  that  men  want  to
prove that they are the ones who have power and control in marriages  or  in
love relationships. Some believe that alcohol and other  substances  play  a
part in causing some men to be uncontrollable. There is also a  belief  that
jealousy is another contributing factor, and to me  that  might  be  a  sign
that the man does not trust the other partner. Some believe that  abusing  a
woman is hereditary. By all of this we  are  not  underestimating  the  fact
that there might be problems in marriages and that,  together  with  poverty
and strife, these factors contribute  to  exacerbating  the  situation,  and
probably alter a man's state of mind for the worst and fill  it  with  rage,
derision and cruelty. Chairperson, I  would  therefore  like  to  leave  the
details or rather the delicacy of these issues for the House to deal with.

As we are about to offer solutions to try and remedy the situation of  abuse
of women and domestic violence, and  violation  of  their  rights,  the  UDM
would  like  express  their  support  for  all   the   recommendations   and
resolutions that are in the report that we are discussing today,  especially
the part that says that those who are  innocent  and  do  not  commit  these
atrocities should say in one big voice that they condemn  this  dirty  habit
that is aimed at downgrading the dignity of men  and  women  alike.  Let  us
support the  recommendation  that  poverty  and  HIV/Aids  should  be  given
special attention when planning development initiatives and  programmes  for
places  that  are  most  hit  by  poverty.  Government   departments,   like
magistrate courts, police stations and all others that are included  in  the
fight against violence against  women,  should  be  provided  with  all  the
necessary resources, skills and education about this matter. [Applause.]]

THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am afraid your time has expired.

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, I stand to talk as a target. [laughter.] ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! No discrimination,  of  whatever  tenor,
will be allowed in this House. Proceed hon member.

Ms S N NTLABATI: I think, as a target, I must first salute all the men  here
who have joined this war in favour of us, and I salute even  the  other  men
outside there who are on this bandwagon with us.
Because many people have already spoken on this matter, I will just talk  on
two issues, namely proactiveness and  the  implementation  of  the  laws  we
make, etc. Why? Because today, probably now, as I am speaking,  there  is  a
woman in pain because of someone having sex with her against her  will  and,
during that, HIV/Aids  is  knowingly  being  transmitted  to  her.  In  most
instances three month  old  or  six  month  old  babies,  because  of  false
beliefs, are victims. Usually,  it  would  be  a  stranger  and,  now,  even
somebody known and supposed to be trusted by this woman.

As a target, I firstly want to make a plea that during this  week,  starting
from tonight, we will have to start thinking globally.  We  have  just  been
talking about Nepad, which is a continental and global issue. I am  pleading
that, although we are going to be acting  locally  when  we  implement,  for
now, let us also think globally about violence against women,  and  not  say
we do  not  have  the  things  I  am  going  to  mention,  that  is  genital
mutilation.

Imagine the agony of it, how painful it is when a pin  pricks  you.  So  how
painful is it when one stitches the flesh of a  young  woman  who  is  maybe
eleven or twelve years old. In  this  instance,  it  is  violence  by  women
against women when genital mutilation is performed.

Let us think today about early marriages of eleven or twelve  year  olds  in
areas South America, where it is happening. How painful is it when  a  child
jumps the steps of childhood, becomes an adult and gets married. The  string
of trafficking. Let us not say, as South  Africans,  these  things  are  not
happening here because we are in a world which is globalising.  So  I  think
we need to be proactive, even on these issues, although we  say  it  is  not
happening to us.

As a target, and in the context of proactiveness, I want to start  from  the
home and plead for a change of mindsets in us as  parents.  When  a  boy  is
born, we buy blue which signifies the sky, the sea and strong things. For  a
girl we buy pink which signifies the soft petals  of  a  flower.  What  does
that mean?  I  am  saying  to  this  young  girl:  ``You  will  have  to  be
submissive. You are a soft thing which has to be submissive''. I  am  saying
to this boy: ``You  are  going  to  be  a  strong  thing  which  has  to  be
aggressive''. That is why I am saying let us also be  proactive  right  from
the way we bring up our children in our homes. This I am still saying  as  a
target.

At schools there are a lot of emotional abuse even from male  teachers  when
a young girl wants to choose certain subjects. Though of late, in  the  21st
century, the teacher may not openly say it but there will be  a  frown.  She
will simply to be told, ``Oh, you are brave' when a girl says, ``I  want  to
be an analytical chemist''. That is emotional abuse,  meaning  that  she  is
trampling in a field which is not hers, as it used to happen in the past.  A
professor, where I trained as a nurse, used to say  to  females  going  into
medicine: ``For six years? When  are  you  going  to  have  babies,  as  God
intended you to?''. We  are  now  in  the  21st  century  but  it  is  still
happening in a very subtle way.

With regard to implementation, we have to  ask  ourselves  questions  as  to
why. Are we not probably failing in the very Acts which we have set up,  the
declarations which we have signed? During the  period  when  this  committee
visited the provinces to give this  report  we  discovered  in  Welkom  that
there are people in the police stations who are  not  sure  about  the  very
Act, who do not even know the terminology  when  one  speaks  of  protection
orders. In the year 2002 they are still using the old  terminology.  How  do
we then expect those people to protect women?

The other things we forget with regard to implementation, is in the  context
of violence. Other than the police stations, the  place  where  more  women,
whose rights have been  violated,  go  to  is  the  hospital,  the  casualty
department of the hospital. We never speak about training the clerks in  the
hospitals, in terms of how to receive victims of  violence.  We  have  never
taught the doctors or the female nurses. How to receive  a  victim  in  this
situation  is  not  in  the  curriculum.  So  I  think  in  the  context  of
implementation we seem to forget  those  other  minor  places  where  women,
whose rights have been violated, go to.

In the church there is  a  very  beautiful  institution  called  the  Sunday
school, where children up to the age of 18  years  are  taught.  I  have  no
objection to children being taught that Jesus Christ was born in  Bethlehem,
this, that and the other. However, that is also a target  group.  I  am  now
challenging churches that this is also where education on  violence  against
women, and all its instances, needs to take place.

Lastly, let us not hide behind culture, because in  every  book,  which  one
might open to read the definition, one realises that culture is not  static,
it is dynamic, it moves with the times. But why does it  not  move  when  it
comes to issues which violate our rights as targets? That needs to be  given
thought. Many members here have  spoken  about  alcohol  being  predisposing
sometimes. So I think it is also a challenge to us that we somehow  need  to
do something about the liquor laws. At the moment I do not  have  an  answer
but I think we need to look into that situation.

The other thing is with  regard  to  the  Joint  Monitoring  Committee.  For
instance, here in our committee there are only two men. One party  also  had
a male but he was removed and a woman was brought in, which means that  this
issue of the status of women has to be fought by women only. I  am  pleading
to our Parliament that that should not be the case.  The  last  thing  is  a
question which torments me.[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That concludes the debate. I shall now put  the
question. The question is that the report be adopted. The decision is  dealt
with  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the  Constitution.  I  note  that  all
delegations have delegation heads  present.  Is  there  any  province  which
wishes to make a declaration of vote? There is none.  We  therefore  proceed
to voting on the question. This will be in alphabetical order. Eastern  Cape

accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Debate concluded.
