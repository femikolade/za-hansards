                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr B NAIR: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  that  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  SARS  Commissioner
       yesterday indicated that SARS will target the super-rich who  do  not
       declare the extent of their income;


  (2) recognises that since the ANC Government came to power, our  national
       fiscus has worked for the benefit of all South Africans, whether  the
       poor or the privileged;


  (3) calls on all South Africans to honour their tax  obligations,  secure
       in the knowledge that  their  taxes  are  used  for  the  benefit  of
       everyone, rather than to promote the privileges of the few; and


  (4) warns all those who seek to evade  their  tax  obligations  that  the
       Government will use the full force of the law to ensure that everyone
       fulfils his tax obligations.

[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House notes -


  (1)  Transparency  International   UK's   latest   scathing   report   on
       ``Corruption in the Official Arms Trade'';
  (2) its adverse findings that the official arms trade accounts for 50% of
       all corrupt international transactions, with a conservative  estimate
       of bribes of 10% in a $40 billion per annum industry;


  (3) that South Africa's arms deal is cited as  a  recent  case  study  of
       corruption in the arms trade;


  (4) that the findings of the report vindicate  all  concerns  in  Scopa's
       14th report which were inadequately and  superficially  addressed  by
       the JIT report; and


  (5) commends the efforts of the whistle-blowers, the opposition in  Scopa
       and the media which  sought  to  uncover  the  truth  in  the  public
       interest.
[Applause.]

Mnu  V  B  NDLOVU:  Somlomo,  ngicela  ukufaka   isaziso   sokuthi   ngosuku
olulandelayo lokuhlala kweNdlu ngiyophakamiso:


  Ukuthi le Ndlu -


  (1)   ikhalele   umndeni   wakwaShabalala,   umholi   weBlack    Mambazo,
       ngokuwuveleleyo;


  (2) ikubuke ngeso elibanzi ukubulawa  ngenhloso  kukaNkosikazi  Shabalala
       ehambele inkonzo eyothandaza;


  (3) inxuse futhi yenze  isiqinisekiso  sokuthi  izigebengu  ezenze  lokhu
       zibanjwe, zivele enkantolo ukuze zigwetshwe kanzima empilweni yazo;


  (4) iQembu leNkatha  yeNkululeko  lidlulisela  ukukhala  kwalo  emndenini
       wakwaShabalala, lithi balale ngenxeba.
(Translation of Zulu notice of motion as follows.)

[Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) conveys its condolences to the family of Mr Shabalala, the leader  of
       Black Mambazo, for the tragedy that has befallen them;


  (2) views in a very serious light the premeditated tragic killing of  Mrs
       Shabalala while attending a prayer service;


  (3) ensures that the perpetrators of this wicked act are apprehended  and
       brought before a court of law and are given the heaviest sentence  of
       their lives; and


  (4) notes that the IFP in particular wishes the bereaved family  strength
       and courage.

[Applause.] ]

Miss T E LISHIVHA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Labour has announced that he  is  awarding
       grants worth R1,2 billion to 18 Setas and  development  projects  via
       the National Skills Fund;


  (2) recognises that for far too long millions of  South  African  workers
       have been suffering from  the  effects  of  the  apartheid  education
       system which intentionally denied them skills and  higher  education,
       condemning them to unemployment and poverty;


  (3) further notes that one of the largest beneficiaries is  the  Domestic
       Workers' Skills Development Project, which has  been  awarded  almost
       R121 million; and


  (4)  commends  the  Government  and  the  Minister  of  Labour  for  this
       groundbreaking advance in empowering  workers  and  developing  their
       skills, in order to develop a competitive and vibrant economy with  a
       skilled and motivated workforce.
[Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock that -


       (a)  some farmers have recently been  accused  of  horrific  violence
           towards their farm workers; and


       (b)  in the latest incident a farmer allegedly  tied  up  his  worker
           with a  rope  and  stretched  him  between  two  vehicles  while
           allegedly uttering racist remarks;


  (2) finds it unacceptable that -


       (a)  anyone can treat another human being in such  an  inhumane  way;
           and


       (b)  a minority  of  farmers  are  damaging  the  perception  of  the
           relationship between all farmers and farm workers; and


  (3) calls for decisive action against anyone  found  guilty  of  inhumane
       behaviour and abuse.
[Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at  the
next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the ongoing gang-related violence on the Cape Flats, which  has
       led to numerous deaths in the past week alone;


  (2) commends the Manenberg community, especially those  involved  at  the
       schools, who are working  hard  to  build  a  safe  environment,  and
       expresses its sympathy to this community that has had to go to  great
       lengths in protecting themselves as the Government is  not  doing  so
       effectively;


  (3) calls on the Government to take their lead from the  members  of  the
       Manenberg community  who  are  actively  engaged  in  securing  their
       community; and


  (4) urges the Minister of Safety and Security  to  actively  ensure  that
       this matter gets addressed immediately.
[Applause.]

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a gang shoot-out on Wednesday claimed the life of a  young  girl
           in Lavender Hill, Cape Town; and


       (b)  the MEC for Community Safety, Mr  Leonard  Ramatlakane,  visited
           this area and other areas which are affected  by  gang  violence
           and has been working with community role-players to find  short-
           term solutions to the scourge of gangsterism;


  (2) believes that in the medium term, the solution to the problems  faced
       by these communities can only be addressed through urban renewal;


  (3) calls on the communities to work with police to bring perpetrators of
       gang violence to book; and


  (4) commends Government for its urban renewal strategy to  rebuild  these
       communities so damaged by the ravages of the past.
[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the ACDP at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  yesterday's election victory and  the  landslide  swing  to  the
           Christian Democrats in the Netherlands, where  they  achieved  a
           decisive victory over the ruling Labour Party coalition, winning
           40 of Parliament's 150 seats; and


       (b)  that this  signifies,  inter  alia,  that  many  voters  in  the
           Netherlands are fed  up  with  the  excessive  secular  humanist
           agenda of the left and wish  to  see  a  return  to  family  and
           traditional values; and


  (2) congratulates the Christian Democrats and wishes  the  new  coalition
       government to be formed in the Netherlands well.
[Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move:


  That this House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the decision by the President of the Republic of South Africa to
           pardon individuals whose activities were  linked  to  liberatory
           efforts and political activities;


       (b)  that the pardons are restricted to those who were convicted  and
           jailed for these activities;


       (c)  that Azapo has one of  its  leaders,  former  Secretary  General
           Comrade George Wauchope, still exiled and he is not  allowed  to
           enter the country; and


       (d)  that he has been informed by the Attorney-General's Office  that
           if he enters the country he will be arrested;


  (2) recognises the role Comrade George Wauchope played in the  liberation
       struggle; and


  (3) calls upon the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene  so  that
       Comrade  George  Wauchope  can  enter  his  country  of  origin   and
       contribute to its development.

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with increasing concern the failure of the  Council  for  Trade
       and Industry institutions  to  have  any  meaningful  impact  on  the
       implementation of the Government's microeconomic reform plan;


  (2) calls for a review of -


       (a)  the effectiveness of the SMME's policies and strategies; and


       (b)  the national Small Business Development Act; and


  (3) urges the Government to establish regulatory  performance  evaluation
       criteria to monitor and evaluate the value for  money  from  transfer
       payments  to  institutions  which  support  enterprise  and  industry
       development.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf
of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern the continuous lack of delivery of  stationery  and
           textbooks in the provinces, notably the Eastern Cape; and


       (b)  that  such  nondelivery  is  the  result  of  tedious  tendering
           procedures; and
  (2) urges the Department  of  Education  to  look  into  these  tendering
       procedures with the aim of promoting  the  culture  of  teaching  and
       learning.

Mr M E GEORGE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the response to a  question  in  the  House  yesterday  by  the
       Minister of Safety and Security in which he informed the House of the
       allocation of police personnel and resources in  areas  disadvantaged
       by the discriminatory practices of the past regime;


  (2) recognises that such areas are now  resourced  equally  to  those  in
       affluent areas, with, for example, Khayelitsha having 242  personnel,
       which represents 112% of the recommended complement, and Thabong with
       124%; and


  (3) applauds the Department of Safety and Security, the SAPS and the  ANC
       Government for their commitment to addressing the security  needs  of
       the  communities  that  are  most  at  risk  from  the   scourge   of
       lawlessness.

Mev ANNA VAN WYK: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die Nasionale Kunsteraad slegs  uitvoerende  kunsteprojekte  van
           nasionale status in 'n beperkte mate kan befonds uit  die  gelde
           wat by die uitvoerende kunsterade weggeneem is; en


       (b)  die uitvoerende kunsterade teaterkomplekse nou slegs volgens die
           ``Playhouse''-konsep bestuur, wat 'n  agteruitgang  van  fisieke
           teaterinfrastruktuur  en  die   vervreemding   van   skaars   en
           onontbeerlike  menslike  hulpbronne  veroorsaak  het  asook  die
           opskorting  van  hierdie  soort  dienste  aan   mense   in   die
           buitestedelike gebiede en die afgeleë platteland; en


  (2) die Minister van Kuns, Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie versoek om so
       spoedig moontlik in elke provinsie 'n volhoubare teatergeselskap  met
       die  nodige  tegniese  en  fisieke  infrastruktuur  te  vestig  sodat
       voorgeskrewe werke in skole en reisende  uitvoerings  in  biblioteke,
       gemeenskapsale, ouetehuise, welsynsinrigtings en hospitale landwyd op
       'n konsekwente en sistematiese wyse gelewer kan word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the National Arts Council can merely to a  limited  extent  fund
           performing arts projects of national status out  of  the  moneys
           taken away from the performing arts councils; and


       (b)  the performing arts councils now only manage  theatre  complexes
           according to the  ``Playhouse''  concept,  which  has  caused  a
           deterioration  in  physical  theatre  infrastructure   and   the
           alienation of scarce and essential human resources  as  well  as
           the suspension of this type of service to people  in  the  peri-
           urban areas and the deep countryside; and


  (2) requests the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science  and  Technology  for
       the swift establishment in each province  of  a  sustainable  theatre
       company with the necessary technical and physical  infrastructure  so
       that prescribed works can be staged in a  consistent  and  systematic
       way in schools and touring performances can take place at  libraries,
       community halls, homes for the  elderly,  welfare  organisations  and
       hospitals throughout the country.]

Mr D J SITHOLE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that at the Nepad Consultative  Workshop  on  the  Agricultural
       Sector in Johannesburg, African leaders in  the  agricultural  sector
       from 15 countries committed to subscribe to the global commitment  of
       the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of hungry people by
       2015;


  (2) further notes that Egypt and South Africa will spearhead  a  campaign
       for accelerating the agricultural strategy to eradicate  poverty  and
       improve food security on the continent;


  (3) believes that Africa should use  agriculture  to  afford  its  people
       access to adequate food, as getting rid of hunger is critical to  the
       success of bringing Africa out of poverty and underdevelopment; and


  (4) welcomes the speed with which Nepad programmes are being put in place
       and looks forward to the achievement  of  tangible  results  for  the
       benefit of all the people of our continent.
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Geagte Speaker, namens die AEB gee ek hiermee kennis  van  die
volgende mosie:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy afkeer uitspreek oor die optrede van onderwysers by 'n  Oos-Randse
       sekondêre skool wat gister geweier het  om  klas  te  gee,  leerlinge
       opgesweep en hul skool in chaos gedompel  het  uit  verset  teen  die
       evaluering     deur     superintendente     van     die     Gautengse
       onderwysdepartement;


  (2) erken dat hierdie optrede  totaal  in  stryd  is  met  onderwysetiek,
       afbrekend is vir dissipline en destruktief inwerk op die onderwys  in
       Suid-Afrika;


  (3) die Minister van Onderwys, prof Kader Asmal, versoek om toe  te  sien
       dat  streng  teen  hierdie  onderwysers  opgetree  word  en  dat  die
       belhamels en aanhitsers summier van hul poste onthef word; en


  (4)  glo  dat   hierdie   gebeure   'n   wekroep   is   vir   provinsiale
       onderwysdepartemente om op te hou om te krap waar dit nie jeuk nie in
       skole soos Ermelo,  Bekker,  FH  Odendaal,  en  HTS  Louis  Botha  in
       Bloemfontein waar gehalte-onderwys, dissipline  en  professionaliteit
       aan die orde van die dag is, en dat hulle eerder moet fokus op  skole
       waar die mees basiese beginsels van dissipline, professionaliteit  en
       'n gunstige leerkultuur totaal afwesig is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its disapproval about the behaviour of teachers at an  East
       Rand secondary school who yesterday refused to teach classes, incited
       pupils  and  plunged  their  school  into  chaos  in  resistance   to
       evaluation by superintendents of the Gauteng department of education;


  (2) admits that  this  behaviour  is  completely  contrary  to  education
       ethics, is destructive to discipline and has a destructive effect  on
       education in South Africa;


  (3) requests the Minister of Education, Prof Kader Asmal, to  see  to  it
       that strong action is taken  against  these  teachers  and  that  the
       ringleaders and inciters are summarily removed from their posts; and


  (4) believes  that  these  events  are  a  clarion  call  for  provincial
       departments of education to stop meddling  unnecessarily  in  schools
       like Ermelo, Bekker, FH Odendaal and HTS Louis Botha in Bloemfontein,
       where quality education, discipline and professionalism are the order
       of the day, and that they should rather focus on  schools  where  the
       most basic principles of discipline, professionalism and a favourable
       culture of learning are entirely absent.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the killing of a 56-year-old farmer on his farm at
       Mooitoekoms, near Viljoenskroon in the Northern Free State;


  (2) further notes that farm killings around South Africa are  allowed  to
       continue unabated;


  (3) also expresses concern about the fact that where no solution is found
       to stop the criminal activity in the killing of farmers, a message is
       conveyed that no political will exists to deal with the problem; and


  (4) calls on the Ministry to enforce  law  and  order  to  stabilise  our
       farming community.

                      90TH BIRTHDAY OF MR WALTER SISULU

  (2) recognises the role he played in building national unity and national
       reconciliation and working towards a free, nonracial,  nonsexist  and
       democratic South Africa; and


  (3) wishes tata Sisulu a joyous 90th birthday.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -

           relevant to South Africa;

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the

                              IMMIGRATION BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon  members  of  the  National
Assembly, in moments like these I become deeply aware that I am not  serving
in Cabinet for my edification or for my pleasure or  political  convenience,
but because I  am  committed  to  walk  the  full  length  of  the  path  of
reconciliation, which is necessary to heal the wounds of  a  conflict  which
killed tens of thousands of people,  and  I  shall  therefore  stand  before
members this morning as the Minister of Home Affairs, for this reason.

The passing of the Immigration Bill by  our  Parliament  is  symbolic  of  a
turning point in our history of South Africa. The  Aliens  Control  Act  was
apartheid's last Act and reflected an  insular  and  discretionary  mindset.
Its repeal seems the last major legislative reform amongst  the  many  which
this Parliament has undertaken since May 1994 to bring us from  the  old  to
the new, as migration control is the last of our functions  to  be  reformed
to adjust to the values and spirit of the new South Africa.

As we emerge from the insular perspective of colonialism and  apartheid,  we
embrace the perspective of globalisation at the dawn of  a  new  millennium.
The Immigration Bill is the culmination of policy  formulation  which  began
in 1995, inclusive of a Green and a White Paper, both  approved  by  Cabinet
after public  comments,  public  hearings  and  conferences.  The  Bill  was
drafted on the tenets of the White Paper approved by  Cabinet  on  31  March
1999 and began  circulating  among  stakeholders  in  November  1999,  being
published for comments on 15 February 2000.

After an international conference  held  on  it,  the  Bill  was  tabled  in
Cabinet where it was discussed in the most minute detail  for  nine  months,
and I remember our  Deputy  President  saying  that,  since  he  arrived  in
Pretoria from KwaZulu-Natal  as  Deputy  Minister,  he  had  never  seen  in
committee any Bill or any matter discussed for three hours.

Thereafter, there was a  workshop  that  was  held  on  it.  Cabinet  itself
amended various sections, eliminating the notion of a statutory  immigration
service exercising migration control on the same basis  as  the  SA  Revenue
Service. It also changed the Immigration Board into an advisory  board  with
no executive powers, and caused about 80 additional amendments.

On 20 May 2000, I requested the tabling of the Bill in Nedlac, where it  was
considered from June 2000. After its  approval  by  Cabinet,  the  Bill  was
tabled in Parliament in April 2001, published again for comments on 29  June
2001, and introduced in the committee soon thereafter. This has been a  long
and difficult process on a  subject  matter  which,  throughout  the  world,
remains impervious to serene policy-making.

I must thank the portfolio committee for the assiduous work of its  members.
I must also thank you, Madam Speaker, for  facilitating  the  processing  of
this Bill, and I also wish to congratulate the hon  Mr  Mpho  Scott  on  his
election to the chairmanship of the committee, extending to  him  a  special
appreciation for brilliantly wrapping up the deliberations of the  committee
at the final and crucial juncture of its deliberations. [Applause.]

I have followed the Bill through the committee and the progress made  there.
I never thought that the Bill would be passed as introduced, for I am not  a
newcomer in  politics  or  Government.  I  was  pleased  that  23  pages  of
amendments were made and discussed on 8 May  and  reflected  in  the  9  May
draft ``B'' version of the Bill. On 9 May, I was informed  that  the  ruling
party had sprung a radical redrafting of  the  Bill,  leading  to  political
discussions to overcome the impasse. Only on 15 May at  8am  did  I  receive
the outcome of such discussions in a reformulated Bill which  was  voted  on
in the afternoon of the same day  in  a  process  which  did  not  allow  my
department  to  take  the  committee  through  its  written  view  on   such
reformulation.  My  own  party  voted   against   key   elements   of   this
reformulation. The DA voted against it as well.

However, I am standing here before  the  House,  not  as  the  leader  of  a
political party, but as a Minister of State. [Applause.] For as  long  as  I
remain a Minister of State, I shall faithfully execute any legislation  this
Parliament may wish to adopt, regardless of  whatever  my  own  reservations
and feelings may be. [Applause.] I am a democrat, and bow  to  the  will  of
the elected representatives. It is my duty  to  present  and  recommend  the
approval of the Immigration Bill, but I feel duty  bound  to  highlight  its
features with the honesty that I have always employed when  speaking  to  my
colleagues, whether in this Chamber or anywhere else.

The Bill before  the  House  is  an  enormous  improvement  on  the  present
uncertainty and levels of  discretion  under  the  Aliens  Control  Act.  It
contains innovative solutions which place South Africa ahead of  many  other
countries  which  are  struggling  with  issues  of  migration  without  the
opportunity of thinking up a new system  from  scratch,  carrying  over  the
core of systems shaped at the end of the nineteenth or in the first part  of
the twentieth century. We  endeavoured  to  conceive  and  launch  a  system
responsive to the needs and challenges of the twenty-first century.

The Bill creates a general entry visitor's permit which caters for  tourists
as well as  short-term  business,  students,  medical  treatment  and  other
activities, which are not work as defined. It also restricts the  definition
of work to require work permits only  when  an  employment  relationship  is
maintained within South Africa.

These provisions reflect an age in which people travel  more  freely  for  a
combination of reasons including business, tourism, study and research.  The
Bill creates permit categories which are clear and  defined,  ensuring  that
everyone in South Africa will be accounted for as  a  citizen,  resident  or
temporary permit  holder,  while  creating  objective  criteria  to  acquire
permanent residence and moving away from the immigrant selection boards.

The Bill  brings  immigration  control  into  compliance  with  the  highest
standards of human rights protection, including administrative and  judicial
review, and the establishment of immigration courts which provide a  unified
area of subject matter jurisdiction, so that  all  cases  flowing  from  the
Bill may be heard in one set of courts, rather than be shuttled between  the
magistrates' courts for warrants and  the  High  Court  for  the  review  of
administrative actions and the validity of regulations.  This  unified  area
of jurisdiction is essential to the good performance of the system with  the
burdens of the additional human rights guarantees.

The Bill strengthens the enforcement of immigration laws,  for  whatever  we
place in legislation becomes irrelevant when millions of  people  flaunt  it
and enter, reside in or remain in the country  illegally.  We  must  develop
capacity to detect, redress and deter illegal immigration.  Our  front  door
to immigration is now opening more widely, but we  must  commit  to  closing
the back door  to  immigration.  The  Bill  establishes  mechanisms  to  co-
ordinate  law  enforcement  amongst  various  organs   of   state,   imposes
responsibilities on certain institutions  of  civil  society  and  sanctions
employers and others who promote or facilitate illegal immigration.

For the first time in our history, and as one  of  the  first  instances  in
this world, the Bill creates the new function of  deterring  and  redressing
xenophobia. We were proud when the United Nations conference  in  Durban  on
the elimination of racism and discrimination for the first time  placed  the
issue of xenophobia on the international human rights agenda, as this  issue
was already entrenched in our own policy formulation and draft  legislation.
We saw from what happened in France with Mr Le  Pen  recently  and  also  in
Holland with Mr Fortuyn that xenophobia has become a raging fire  throughout
the world. And we will learn more about xenophobia, which often operates  in
subtle forms, as do many other forms of discrimination.

The Bill recognises that migration control cuts across many  line  functions
and that policy formulation will need to continue in  the  future,  both  to
address the matters of detail to be set out in  regulations  and  to  adjust
the system to the ever-changing needs of the future.  For  this  reason,  it
provides for an Immigration Advisory Board with crucial roles in  developing
policies on the  basis  of  interdepartmental  co-ordination  and  with  the
involvement of representatives  of  civil  society.  As  is  done  in  other
countries, the Bill also requires that  regulations  be  adopted  through  a
necessary process of public participation, and that  they  may  be  declared
invalid not only if they violate the Act, but also  if  they  disregard  the
advice of the immigration board or public comments  in  a  manner  which  is
arbitrary and capricious.

The   Bill   clears   the   currently   constitutionally   problematic   and
administratively  difficult  situation  and  vests  border  control  in  the
Department  of   Home   Affairs,   while   providing   for   mechanisms   of
interdepartmental co-ordination in respect  of  this  function,  and  for  a
process in which, with the consent of all parties concerned,  resources  and
capacity may be transferred to our department to fulfil this function.

Also in  this  respect,  South  Africa  is  moving  towards  a  more  modern
regulation and structuring of border  control  which  reflects  present  and
future challenges. The Bill clarifies that the Department  of  Home  Affairs
will be responsible for the administration of  ports  of  entry  where  more
than 10 departments or agencies have  to  perform  their  respective  roles,
which has often created  confusion  and  lack  of  co-ordination,  replacing
ineffective   voluntary   co-ordination    with    a    precise    statutory
responsibility.
In this and many other respects,  the  Bill  represents  a  monumental  step
ahead and sets our country on a much  stronger  footing  to  cope  with  the
issues of migration control which are bound to  rise  exponentially  in  the
years to come.

International migration is the fastest growing phenomenon in the  world  and
I believe that in the 21st century it is bound to pose  the  conceptual  and
policy challenges which, in the  20th  century,  the  development  of  human
rights did.

However, and a big however, in other respects the Bill before the  House  is
profoundly different from our Government's policies to this  point  and  the
terms of the debate on immigration control  during  the  past  seven  years.
These differences became evident to me for the  first  time  only  when  the
revised version of the Bill was informally presented to  me  48  hours  ago,
for I, as the Minister, was not formally informed of any amendments made  to
the Bill, in respect of which my department was not involved or consulted.

Up until 48 hours ago, our Government maintained and declared to  the  world
a policy based on tenets which have now  been  subverted.  The  core  of  an
immigration policy is  the  determination  of  which  skilled  or  unskilled
foreigner workers are needed for our economic  wellbeing.  Since  the  White
Paper, we held that Government is ill equipped to determine the  skills  our
country needs, and we realised that in the modern labour  markets  assessing
immigration applications on the basis of skills is extremely  difficult  and
demands massive administrative capacity. We also realised the difficulty  of
classifying skills, as our country's economic growth needs skills both  from
the high and the low level of the spectrum, and in the modern world one  can
no longer equate skills with qualifications.

Therefore, we designed a system which tested  the  need  for  foreigners  by
relying on market dynamics, leaving employers  to  decide  which  foreigners
they need, while we, as Government, would test the intensity  of  employers'
stated needs through a licensing fee. If an employer pays the licensing  fee
which  makes  the  foreigner  more  expensive  than  a  national,  then  the
foreigner would be needed, and we could raise the  threshold  of  acceptable
need by raising the licensing fee.

The Bill before the House has gone in  a  diametrically  opposite  direction
and requires our Government to determine every year what skills we need  and
to establish categories to  accommodate  each  conceivable  foreigner  whose
skill may contribute to or be needed for our economic  growth,  and  to  set
numeric  limits  for  each  such  category.  Rather  than  relying  on   and
influencing market  forces,  this  approach  reflects  the  command  economy
philosophy which predicates that Government may be able  to  assess  present
needs and predict future challenges and aspirations.

In addition to  the  difficulty  of  creating  categories  and  quotas,  our
Government  would  need  to  perform  delicate  assessments,   reviews   and
evaluations in respect of each application to ensure that the applicant  has
indeed the skills he claims to have and fits  the  category,  in  a  process
which may resemble what an employer does when interviewing a person.

This  process  is  simpler   when   skills   are   entirely   reflected   in
qualifications, as would be the case of a dentistry  degree-holder  applying
under a dentist category, for instance.  But  what  about  someone  claiming
years of  academic  experience  in  China  applying  under  a  category  for
journalists, or someone claiming years of engineering experience in  Finland
applying under a category for project managers?  These  are  very  difficult
things for us to check, and even more difficult for us to evaluate.

The Bill provides that when quotas are exceeded, foreigners may obtain  work
permits through a complex process of labour  certification.  Our  department
will  need  to  develop  large  additional   administrative   capacity   for
conducting  this  new  function  and  will  need  much   greater   budgetary
allocations. Hon members know that my  department,  as  far  as  funding  is
concerned, has always been the stepchild of the Budget.

The complete shift of policy which has taken place in the past 48 hours  has
indeed created a completely new Bill and a  new  policy  framework  in  more
areas than work permits alone.

Another tenet of Government policy, as it stood  until  48  hours  ago,  was
that of simplifying permitting  procedures  so  that  the  permit  could  be
issued without any evaluative process.  By  eliminating  the  need  for  our
department to perform evaluations, we can  issue  permits  in  an  objective
fashion and directly from  our  regional  offices,  rather  than  having  to
centralise in  order  to  concentrate  activities  in  our  scarce  pool  of
available resources.

In  order  to  reach  this  objective,  we  relied  on  various   forms   of
outsourcing, especially to accountants and  reliable  institutions,  and  we
eliminated evaluative stages. However, a great number of  evaluative  stages
have now been reinserted in  respect  of  most  permitting  procedures,  and
provision is made enabling any applicant who does not  wish  to  utilise  an
accountant, to request the department to  perform  the  relevant  assessment
and evaluation.

The policy of shifting administrative capacity away  from  the  issuance  of
permits, to move it into law enforcement and border  control,  will  not  be
able to be pursued to the same extent. We will also not be able to  expedite
the issuance of permits as envisaged. The Bill no longer contains  provision
for the decentralisation of its permit issuance functions, which  were  core
to the overall policy and administrative reform.

The most concerning aspect is that the  provision  required  to  restructure
the  department  in  an  expedited  manner  to  meet  the  new   legislative
requirements, has been completely deleted. This means that it will  take  us
a long time  to  go  through  the  ordinary  procedure  to  restructure  the
department and reorganise positions, job descriptions and the  establishment
on an individual basis. We will not be able to deliver  the  new  system  of
migration control as  fast  as  we  expected  and  without  significant  and
possibly damaging down-time.

The Bill contains aspects in respect  of  which  I  cannot  speak,  such  as
corporate permits, as the original provision, which  was  one  of  the  most
innovative and worldwide acclaimed aspects of our previous policy,  has  now
been amended beyond recognition. I do not  know  whether  corporate  permits
fall under the quotas or outside  them,  and  what  function  they  actually
serve. We will try our best to give them purpose and maintain the  important
function for which they were originally designed, even though they  will  no
longer enable the department to save significant administrative capacity  in
respect of their issuance.

It is unusual for a Minister to do so, but it would be remiss of me  not  to
place on record that there are technical problems with this  Bill  which,  I
hope, will be corrected before its enactment.  Under  the  circumstances,  I
should have withdrawn this Bill, because it is  my  prerogative  to  do  so.
However, we are labouring under a Constitutional Court deadline, forcing  us
to replace the Aliens Control Act, which was  declared  unconstitutional  in
its handling of permanent life partnerships, work permits  for  spouses  and
certain requirements relating to applications for permits from  outside  the
country.

I must ask, what led the political parliamentary processes to turn  policies
upside down, outside the parameters of public debates that took  place  over
a long period and consultation that was  so  wide-ranging  and  so  long  in
duration? All those who made submissions to my department,  and  who  seemed
to  be  averse  to  a  generalised  quota  system,  had  no   problem   with
decentralisation and, on the preponderance of submissions,  were  in  favour
of outsourcing certain functions  in  order  to  reduce  the  administrative
capacity to dedicate to the issuance of permits.

The  ruling  party  never  formally  expressed  a  contrary  view   in   any
publications known to me, or in its contributions in this process. In  fact,
when the Bill came here, it was not Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Bill, it was  the
Cabinet's Bill, very radically amended over a long period.
The people of South Africa, after this long process, know  what  I  intended
doing for immigration in South Africa. No one does not know  it  by  now.  I
shared the draft Bill with Ministers in charge of immigration in Canada,  in
Washington and in Holland,  and  also  in  Geneva  in  December.  I  do  not
question the right of this legislature to amend the Bill as it sees fit,  as
I have said earlier.

In fact, a lot  of  the  amendments  were  effected  through  the  portfolio
committee, as should be the case. The problem came  about  when  members  of
the ruling party came out with a different Bill from that which had  already
been amended by members of the Portfolio Committee on  Home  Affairs,  where
all parties were represented.

The department was not given  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  Bill's
amendments and it was not  given  the  opportunity  to  respond  after  each
presentation, as should be the case, before  the  committee  representations
which, by the way, were given by select people. There are  many  people  who
wanted to make representations who were not  given  the  opportunity.  If  I
withdrew the Bill at this stage, as was my instinct to do, I  felt  that  we
could not meet the Constitutional Court's deadline. So, I  was  in  a  cleft
stick. This has placed me in a situation where I am presenting and  piloting
a Bill of this Parliament as my Bill. But, it is the Bill as amended by  the
majority party, warts  and  all.  It  is  this  legislature  which  will  be
answerable, should there be problems in the areas that I have pointed out.

There is no doubt in my mind that this process shows  the  weakness  of  our
democracy, where whims seem to prevail over responsible policy  formulation.
This highlights lack of leadership in a fundamental  aspect  of  governance,
for the provisions of this Bill that relate to work permits have  a  massive
impact on our macroeconomic equation. A few  days  ago,  the  United  States
trade representative identified  our  antiquated  and  obsolete  immigration
laws as one of the three  major  impairments  to  doing  business  in  South
Africa.

What Cabinet placed before this Parliament was what I felt to  be  the  best
way to respond to present needs and future challenges.  I  cannot  help  but
read the response that Parliament gave to Cabinet  proposals  as  a  process
gone astray, in which the desire to assert  the  political  primacy  of  the
ruling party overrode  reason  and  careful  consideration  of  the  issues.
Apparently, the positions shifted dramatically from Thursday  last  week  to
Wednesday this week, signifying  that  rewriting  this  Bill,  even  without
clarity on issues, was more important  than  allowing  the  perception  that
something good and worthwhile may come from Minister  Buthelezi  who,  after
all, is only a  leader  of  a  minority  party  in  Government.  This  shows
weakness and insecurity and, in the final analysis, it also shows a lack  of
true leadership.

We  were  offered  the  opportunity  of  leapfrogging  ahead  but,  in  many
respects, we now need to lag behind. The need will  continue  to  arise  for
Parliament to intervene again, through legislation, on this subject matter.

I have done the best for my country as conscience demanded  of  me.  I  have
bowed  before  the  wishes  of  this  legislature  and  the  ruling   party.
[Applause.]

Mr M I SCOTT: Madam Speaker, hon  members,  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  and
Deputy Minister, I would like, first, to thank  the  former  chairperson  of
the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs for the role that he played  in  the
committee. It is a great pleasure to  participate  in  the  debate  on  this
important Immigration Bill.
I would like to thank  all  members  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Home
Affairs, the department and the state law advisers for  their  participation
in processing this Bill.  This  product,  the  Immigration  Bill,  does  not
necessarily meet  all  our  expectations  as  different  parties  and  other
stakeholders, but it is a product that, I believe, all of us can live with.

This Bill is a first step in the right direction to contribute to a  planned
system of immigration that is simple, achievable, manageable, and  in  South
Africa's interests in particular. The passing of this Bill is not an end  in
itself. Together with the Government, we will have to  evaluate,  from  time
to time, whether it meets our intended objectives.

The problem of racism and xenophobia will have to be fought at  all  levels.
The education of our law-enforcement agencies and communities  needs  to  be
intensified.

The partnership with communities is of paramount importance in this  regard.
The fight against continued fraud and corruption in the ranks  of  officials
will have to be intensified.
It is important to correct the perception, created wittingly or  unwittingly
by some people, that this is an IFP Bill. That is incorrect. Any  Bill  that
comes from the Cabinet is a  Government  Bill  and  it  is  our  Government.
[Applause.] As a committee we had to process this Bill just like  any  other
Bill in Parliament and it  is  important  to  note  comments  by  state  law
advisers  that  there  was  no  way  the  committee  could  make   wholesale
amendments without rewriting the whole Bill. It is for that reason that  the
wholesale amendments were avoided.

During deliberations in the committee the  consultation  among  parties  was
very useful and constructive towards finding  solutions  and  agreements  in
areas of contention. It was quite a long but necessary process. Hence  there
was a general consensus on  more  than  50  clauses  of  the  Bill  and  the
committee only voted on three clauses where parties agreed  to  disagree.  I
believe our working as a team and a collective  will  continue  beyond  this
Bill on immigration.

It is in our interest to see to it that  the  department  works  effectively
and in an efficient manner. This is one of the departments  that  deal  with
and are in contact with people  on  a  daily  basis.  We  are  committed  to
ensuring that we work together with the department in a constructive  manner
to ensure its success whilst at the same time playing our watchdog  role  as
parliamentary committee.

Today we live in a global village where we have to  engage  and  compete  in
terms of skills and technology with other  markets.  We  should  acknowledge
that there is a shortage of skills at the higher-end  level  of  the  labour
market in many occupational categories that is contributing to  the  slowing
down of the pace of economic growth  and  development.  South  Africa  needs
human foreign investment. It  is  not  correct  to  assume  that  every  job
occupied by a non-South African means one job less for a South  African.  We
need managed migration  that  can  contribute  to  the  stimulation  of  our
econonic growth and development and  create  jobs  for  South  Africans.  We
believe that it is possible to achieve managed immigration in a manner  that
is consistent with the achievement of Government's  growth  and  development
policies and with the requirements of the Constitution, the Bill  of  Rights
and international obligations.

It is important to note the trends in the  formation  of  economic  regional
blocs with migration regimes that have preferential treatment  and  mobility
of citizens of member states. The example is the EU,  which  represents  the
most advanced model of such arrangements. It is clear  that  in  the  longer
term we will have to have such arrangements  in  SADC.  We  should  continue
deliberately contributing to creating vibrant and strong  economies  in  our
regional states if we are to achieve this long-term objective,

We   should   acknowledge   the   mobility   of   skills   and    technology
internationally. This Bill seeks to attract skills needed  by  our  economy.
It also acknowledges the  high  level  of  competition  for  highly  skilled
international migrants. That is why we came up with  ways  of  fast-tracking
the issuing of work and corporate permits. This will  be  done  through  the
assessment of South Africa's current and projected labour market needs  with
the co-operation of the Department of Labour, the Department  of  Trade  and
Industry  and  other  stakeholders;  by  developing,  at   least   annually,
immigration targets and quotas; through the revised  system  of  immigration
and selection that I think this Bill lays the foundation  for;  and  through
the enhanced access of highly skilled international migrants.

A lot of work still needs to be done in terms of  drafting  regulations  for
the implementation of this Bill and it is going to be  challenging  for  the
department to provide  immigration  services  in  the  most  cost-effective,
efficient and service-friendly manner.

The department needs resources to build a  strong  human  resource  capacity
and to move into automation in  this  area.  Setting  up  systems  that  can
communicate could go a long way  towards  fast-tracking  the  processing  of
applications and being in a position to check  and  cross-check  information
in a short space of time.

The department needs to ensure continuous training and that it attracts  the
necessary skills needed if we are to succeed in  the  smooth  implementation
of this Bill.

In conclusion, let us all work together in order to ensure that in the  long
term we have perfect policies and legislation that contribute to creating  a
better life for our people. [Applause.]

Mr G A J GROBLER: Madam Speaker, at last we  are  debating  the  Immigration
Bill, the Bill which will be known as the Immigration Act of 2002.  The  Act
will not only repeal the whole of the Aliens Control Act but  also  sections
of the South African Citizenship Act and sections of the Refugees Act.  This
Bill is not a perfect Bill and I am sure amendments will be brought  to  the
House in future.

Firstly, I briefly want to take hon members back to August last  year,  when
the Bill landed on our desks. From the onset, the official Opposition  asked
in the portfolio committee for a timeframe  within  which  this  Immigration
Bill should be deliberated and finalised,  as  there  was  a  Constitutional
Court ruling on the constitutionality of the Aliens Control Act of 1999,  as
amended, and the deadline was set for 2 June 2002.

Every time the  DA  asked  for  a  timeframe  it  was  gagged  by  the  then
chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs.  A  positive  change
in this position has taken place and we are glad about it.

Instead of us doing our work as a portfolio  committee,  we  had  to  attend
some sort of reading courses. Each member  of  the  committee  had  to  read
clauses of the Bill, like children in a classroom, which we are not.

After the December recess, in February 2002, the request from the DA to  the
then chairperson of the portfolio committee to speed up  the  process  again
fell on deaf ears. After the official Opposition, the IFP and the UDM  could
not stand this any longer, the Rules Committee was approached and  we  again
brought to the Rules Committee's attention the seriousness of delaying  this
Bill. The committee and the Speaker came to our rescue  and  instructed  the
then chairperson to come forward with a programme and  dates.  Members  from
the NA and the NCOP, at  great  additional  cost  to  the  taxpayers  -  air
tickets alone cost R66 000 -  had  to  come  back  during  the  constituency
period to start working on the Bill from 15 April. [Interjections.]

Hon members should listen to this. After a rather  bumpy  start,  and  after
the opposition parties again had  to  complain  about  the  time  wasted  on
inputs by people who did not even bother to  touch  the  issues  around  the
Immigration Bill - the persons I am referring to  are  the  director-general
and the then Deputy Minister of Home Affairs ...

... helaas, het die hoop weer beskaam. Dit was baie gou  duidelik  dat  daar
geen begeerte by die  ANC-lede  van  die  portefeuljekomitee  was  om  enige
ernstige pogings aan te wend om die afhandeling van hierdie  wetsontwerp  te
bespoedig nie. Dit was duidelik dat daar op elke moontlike manier  teen  die
Departement van Binnelandse Sake se voorgestelde wetgewing gewerk word.  Die
gewaarwording by die amptelike Opposisie was dat daar  gepoog  word  om  die
lewe vir die Minister van Binnelandse Sake so onaangenaam moontlik te  maak.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[... alas, hope maketh ashamed once more. Very soon  it  became  clear  that
there was no wish among the ANC members of the portfolio committee  to  make
any serious attempt at  finalising  this  Bill.  It  was  evident  that  the
proposed legislation of the Department of Home Affairs was being opposed  in
every way possible. The impression gained by  the  official  Opposition  was
that the life of the Minister of Home Affairs was being made  as  unpleasant
as possible.]

For many years businesses and many people in South Africa pinned  all  their
hopes on Government to formulate a  proper  Immigration  Act,  an  Act  that
would not only regulate the movement of people,  but  also  create  investor
confidence, to make it easier for skilled people to come  to  South  Africa.
Not only do we need skilled people, but also  foreign  capital  that  is  so
essential to create the jobs that we so desperately need in this country.

All these hopes by business and other  stakeholders  were  bogged  down  for
years in political altercations between the ANC and the IFP. All the  while,
people's expectations have come no closer to  the  fulfilment  of  a  pledge
last year by President Mbeki that Government would move  quickly  to  remedy
the delay in the processing of the Immigration Bill.

The ANC in this whole process seems to have ridden roughshod  over  Minister
Buthelezi  and  his  department's  proposed  views   concerning   a   proper
immigration  Bill.  [Interjections.]  As  we  tried  to  progress   on   the
deliberations of this Bill, there was no doubt that the  ANC  had  only  one
goal in mind, that of redrafting  the  Immigration  Bill  at  any  cost  and
without any rhyme or reason. Its  concern  was  that  the  Immigration  Bill
formulated by Mr Buthelezi's department should not be passed.  According  to
our  observation,  we  also  did  not   follow   parliamentary   procedures.
[Interjections.]

A few weeks ago we had public  hearings  and  as  far  as  I  am  concerned,
without proper notice. After two weeks  of  deliberation  in  the  portfolio
committee on Home Affairs on the original Bill from the Department  of  Home
Affairs, out of the blue on Thursday, 9 May the ANC  gave  us  a  completely
redrafted Bill. This Bill was different from the one  given  to  us  earlier
and the one before us. Their main aim was to show that the  ANC  itself  had
drafted a Bill.

The redraft did not, for instance, call for quotas - an aspect I  will  deal
with in more detail later -  but  had  an  absurd  and  totally  impractical
process of issuing work permits on a  basis  of  labour  certifications  and
innumerable other requirements. From Thursday,  9  May  till  Wednesday,  15
May, a new draft was put before us. It  is  obvious  that  because  of  some
pressure put  on  the  ANC  during  discussions  with  the  IFP,  they  were
confronted with the absurdities of some of their  proposals  and  they  then
realised that it was untenable and they were very  quick  to  drop  some  of
their proposals. They reformulated a completely new  set  of  proposals.  To
them it did not matter  as  long  as  they  were  not  the  proposals  which
Minister Buthelezi's department had placed before us. [Interjections.]

The DA cannot support the work  permit  clause,  clause  19,  or  the  quota
system. Clause 19 provides that the primary method  and  technique  for  the
issuance of work permits would be that  of  quotas.  However,  it  does  not
design or define the system of quotas and leaves it  to  the  discretion  of
the present or the future Minister of Home Affairs. The DA  had  five  hours
to read and consider the new proposal, which was then voted  on  and  passed
by virtue of an ANC majority against the official Opposition and votes  from
the IFP.

The quota system is at  the  opposite  end  of  the  spectrum  of  what  was
provided for by the original Bill introduced by the  department.  Since  the
publication of the White Paper, the notion was that  Government  should  and
could not determine  what  skills  we  needed.  What  we  witnessed  in  our
committee  the  day  before  yesterday  in  respect  of  clause  19  was   a
fundamental clash of philosophies of governance.

The quota system represents the epitome  of  statism,  command  economy  and
centralisation. It reflects the presumptions  and  always  erroneous  notion
that government may determine the need of  society.  On  the  contrary,  the
notion espoused in the original Bill was that Government  cannot  make  such
determinations. The  Bill  was  relying  on  the  free  dynamics  of  market
economy, creating incentives and disincentives, as one would do in a  modern
world. The original draft was the product of a  perspective  which  embraces
and  understands  the  dynamics  of  the  21st  century  and  the   age   of
globalisation.

Most countries are moving away from the quota system and are  doing  so  for
good reasons. The administration, for  a  start,  is  becoming  increasingly
impossible in a labour market characterised by the irreparable breakdown  of
the connection between qualifications, skills and  job  descriptions.  There
are clauses such as the restructuring of the department which  were  deleted
by the ANC from the original Bill, and  the  clause  on  offences  that  was
amended and that the DA did not approve of.

We would have liked to have given reasons for all the  objections  to  these
changes but due to a lack of time it cannot be done.  Because  of  the  fact
that  this  Bill  is  a  step  forward,  the  DA  reluctantly  supports  the
Immigration Bill. [Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, hon Minister of Home Affairs ...  Ndabezitha
[You of the above (a royal salute) ...]

... other Ministers in the House and hon members, the Immigration  Bill  was
introduced in Parliament by  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  and
president of the IFP, not as an IFP Bill, but as a Cabinet Bill, as  already
stated by the Minister and  the  chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee.
Needless  to  say,  the  IFP  supported  the  Bill  from  the  day  of   its
introduction, with all the details the hon the Minister  has  placed  before
this House.

During consideration  of  the  Bill  by  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Home
Affairs, the ANC  proposed  wide-ranging,  potentially  damaging  amendments
that would have altered the hon  the  Minister's  Bill  beyond  recognition.
Therefore, in order to avert a looming crisis, the IFP and the  ANC  agreed,
last week, to appoint a negotiating team to  solve  what  was  fast  turning
into a no-win situation for all parties concerned, until the Bill  became  a
piece of legislation the country would be able to live with.

It is the IFP's considered position that the appointment  of  a  negotiating
team succeeded in improving the final Bill  to  the  degree  that  the  ill-
considered amendments proposed were not steamrollered through the  portfolio
committee by virtue of the ANC's majority status in Parliament.

The IFP will support the  passage  of  the  Immigration  Bill,  with  strong
reservations with regard to the work permit system,  the  rejection  of  the
clauses on the restructuring of the Department of Home Affairs  and  further
rejection  of  the  fines  for  offenders  and  perpetuators  of  xenophobic
practices. The IFP can, therefore,  reluctantly  and  with  certain  serious
reservations, support the Bill as presented to the House today. However,  we
have to insist that the Bill that was originally tabled was  a  much  better
version and would have left South Africa in a much better position  to  deal
with issues of immigration.

The negotiations between the IFP  and  the  ANC  over  the  past  week  were
difficult, but were conducted in a good spirit by the  gentlemen  concerned.
We appreciate the efforts of the Chief Whip of the ANC, hon Mr  Nhleko,  for
being instrumental in arranging  the  formation  of  the  negotiating  team,
together  with  the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister,  Rev  Zondi,  for  removing
potential stumbling blocks in its operation. The  IFP  would  also  like  to
express its gratitude to the members of the two-person technical  team,  ANC
Deputy Chief Whip Mr Andries Nel,  and  the  chairperson  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Home Affairs, Mr Mpho Scott.

We place on record our appreciation of the fact that the  negotiations  were
conducted without any hidden agendas and in an  honest  and  relaxed  manner
where the only objective was to achieve a workable solution.  [Applause.]  I
would also like to express the IFP's appreciation for the constructive  role
which Mr J H van der Merwe, the Chief Whip of the IFP,  and  Mr  P  F  Smith
played in the negotiations.

It is no secret that the Immigration Bill took an  unprecedented  amount  of
time from  the  Green  Paper  stage  to  its  finally  being  introduced  in
Parliament - too much time by most accounts. The reasons for the  inordinate
delay are numerous, and it could arguably have resulted from many  different
quarters. In the end, though, the unusually long delay caused suspicions  of
hidden agendas, and uncertainty about how the Bill would be  implemented  in
the absence of its original mechanisms.
Eventually, the Bill is before this House today. It  is  truly  an  historic
day, and for that reason, one should perhaps try to forget  all  the  trials
and tribulations that have been experienced in the past. The IFP would  also
like to express its sincere appreciation for the role  played  by  officials
from  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  and  for  their   dedication   and
application in guiding the Bill through many very difficult stages.

I know that  it  is  customary  to  applaud  the  extraordinary  efforts  of
departmental officials in this House, but in this case it  is  very  sincere
and very genuine. We thank the Deputy  Director-General,  Mr  Lambinon,  the
Head  of  Legal  Services,  Mr  Malatji,  and  the  Minister's  adviser,  Dr
Ambrosini, for their sterling efforts and uncompromising commitment  to  the
hon the Minister's vision for South Africa's  new  immigration  legislation.
Dr Ambrosini deserves a further special mention. Over the years he has  been
available day and night, and over weekends, to assist all  and  sundry  with
whatever queries or problems they might have had.

The IFP would also like to thank  the  recently  appointed  chairperson  and
members of the Portfolio Committee on Home  Affairs  for  their  dedication,
patience and co-operation. A most difficult task had been placed before  the
committee, but members dealt with it with aplomb and in the spirit  of  true
democracy.

Finally, I would be remiss in not extending the very great  appreciation  of
the IFP for the role which you, Madam Speaker, played in introducing  a  new
leadership in the portfolio committee for the  finalisation  of  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr D A MOKOENA: Madam Speaker, I do not know why you  look  so  particularly
smart this morning. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: I was trying to match your outfit. [Laughter.]

Mr D A MOKOENA: Thank you. Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  the  department,
colleagues and guests, I rise here to speak in support  of  the  Immigration
Bill on behalf of the ANC.

It is indeed a privilege to participate in this debate on  the  Bill,  which
is the second major piece  of  legislation  under  Home  Affairs  that  this
Parliament is about to  pass,  the  first  one  having  been  the  Municipal
Electoral Act of  2000  that  ushered  in  the  dispensation  of  the  first
nonracial democratic local government elections in the country.

This Immigration Bill has 61 clauses. I will focus  on  five  clauses,  that
is, the ones dealing with law enforcement and monitoring. However, before  I
address these five clauses, it is important to pass a few remarks.

Firstly, the Immigration Bill did not just fall out of the  sky.  A  lot  of
work had been done before. Our Minister, the hon  Dr  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi,
formulated it. I take this opportunity to salute him  for  taking  the  bold
step to put together this novel Bill.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Kgotso Ntate! [Peace!] [Applause.]

Mr D  A  MOKOENA:  Secondly,  South  Africa  has  never  had  to  deal  with
immigration, except the old apartheid outmoded  Aliens  Control  Act,  which
predictably inspired many court challenges by  people  who  wanted  to  seek
redress and thus assert their constitutional rights.  With  the  Immigration
Bill, the Aliens Control Act will ipso facto fall away.
Three, the  Immigration  Bill  was  preceded  by  vigorous  public  hearings
conducted by the portfolio committee. This  exercise  afforded  stakeholders
and the public in general a foretaste of the Immigration Bill.

Four, Cabinet also applied its mind to the Bill and expunged a  clause  that
provided for  the  inauguration  of  the  highly  controversial  immigration
service. This helped to relieve the burden on the Bill.

Five, I would like  to  take  the  opportunity  to  congratulate  our  newly
appointed Deputy Minister, the hon Nosiviwe Mapisa  Nqakula,  and  wish  her
well in her new role. [Applause.]

Six, by the same token, I would like to compliment  my  successor,  the  hon
Mpho Scott, for his contribution towards the finalisation of this  Bill  and
also for developments including the parliamentary processes that ensued.

Seven, I must also express a word of  thanks  to  the  Director-General,  Mr
Billy Masetlha, and  his  team  for  their  sterling  work  in  running  the
department efficiently, especially  in  rooting  out  corruption.  Will  hon
members give them a big hand, please. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Eight, I would like to state categorically that  this  Immigration  Bill  is
neither the Bill of the IFP nor of the ANC, but the Bill of  our  Government
that  is  designed  to  service  the  best   interests   of   our   country.
[Interjections.]

Lastly, in terms of preliminary remarks, it must be placed  on  record  that
after the developments and processes alluded to above, this Bill was  tabled
before the portfolio committee on 25 August 2001. Since then, the  portfolio
committee has arduously worked out ways in which the Bill could be  adjusted
and freed of certain features that would invariably qualify it  as  a  prime
candidate for a series of constitutional challenges.

I am now starting with Clause 37, one of  the  five  clauses  I  am  dealing
with, on the immigration courts. Clause 40  of  the  initial  Bill  provided
that in order to speed up the process of handling immigration matters,  Home
Affairs  must  establish  immigration  courts  ``with   exclusive   original
jurisdiction''.  The  proposed  courts  would  have   their   own   physical
infrastructure, magistrates  and  assistants  who  would  be  selected  from
within and outside the  Public  Service,  or  qualified  officials.  Such  a
clause, if not amended, would compel Government to  create  a  new  judicial
system that would run parallel to the current court system.

During the public hearings, we received numerous warnings from  professional
legal societies and academic lawyers that it would be maladroit, to  put  it
mildly, for  the  portfolio  committee  to  pass  it  on  to  Parliament  to
legislate as it was. However, this is not all gloom and doom.  The  Minister
of Home Affairs and the Minister of Justice and  Constitutional  Development
held talks, coupled with further negotiations.

These efforts culminated in the revised clause, marked 37.  This  clause  is
progressive in that it provides for  the  fact  that,  ``Every  magistrates'
court is an Immigration Court for the purposes of this Act  and  shall  have
jurisdiction on any matter arising  from  the  application  of  this  Act''.
Furthermore, the Rules Board of Courts of Law, established in terms  of  the
relevant Act, shall as soon as possible craft rules for the adjudication  of
immigration cases and related matters.

Clause 32 deals with illegal foreigners. This clause deals with one  of  the
law enforcement aspects in respect of illegal foreigners. The crux  of  this
clause is that any illegal foreigner shall depart except when authorised  by
the department to stay in the country while awaiting the outcome of  his  or
her application.

Clause 33, headlined ``Inspectorate'', provides for an  enforcement  measure
in the form of an inspectorate.

The previous version was an investigative  unit  which  would  have  awesome
powers to enter and search any premises without a warrant, examine  anything
and apprehend any illegal foreigners. These are clearly  draconian  measures
that  are  reminiscent  of  the  old  ``skop-skiet-en-donder''   [blood-and-
thunder] attitude.

This clause has been redrafted with the substitution  of  the  inspectorate,
which  shall  be  established  through  regulations   and   shall   comprise
immigration officers as may be determined by  the  Minister.  The  DG  shall
recommend to the Minister whom to appoint as head of the inspectorate.  When
carrying out his or her duties, an immigration officer shall be  obliged  to
identify  himself  or  herself  by   means   of   adequate   identification.
[Interjections.]

Clause 34, which  deals  with  the  deportation  and  detention  of  illegal
foreigners, has not  been  changed.  It  is  meant  to  give  teeth  to  the
immigration officers to arrest, without  need  for  a  warrant,  an  illegal
foreigner or cause him or her to be arrested and deported to the country  of
their origin or to  detain  them  at  a  place  under  the  control  of  the
department, determined by the director-general, while the illegal  foreigner
is awaiting the outcome of an appeal. However,  the  illegal  foreigner  may
not be kept in detention for longer than 30 calendar days without a  warrant
of a court.

On good and reasonable grounds, this period of  detention  may  be  extended
for a further period not exceeding 90 calendar days and the  detainee  shall
be held under conditions that ensure minimum standards of dignity and  human
rights.

The portfolio committee has not amended clause 35, which deals  with  ships.
It provides for the normal procedures and obligations  of  a  ship  entering
the Republic by landing or shoring at any port of entry, as well as  routine
checks being carried out by immigration officers.

The original title of clause 36, which deals with  monitoring  entries  into
and exits from the Republic, was ``Border  Control''.  It  sought  that  the
Department of Home Affairs should control the borders of  South  Africa  and
may receive a delegation from  other  relevant  departments  such  as  Sars,
Safety and Security, etc. I can see that my  time  is  almost  running  out.
[Interjections.] Anyway, I wish to say that we love the hon the  Minister  -
we all love him. [Time expired.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mnr I J PRETORIUS: Mev die Speaker, dit is vir my 'n  aangename  voorreg  om
namens  die  Nuwe  NP  aan  die  bespreking  oor  hierdie  wetsontwerp   oor
immigrasie deel te neem. Voordat ek by die teks van my  toespraak  kom,  wil
ek net graag sê dat die agb lid mnr Grobler hier te kenne gegee het dat  die
meerderheidsparty na willekeur met voorstelle gekom het om  die  wetsontwerp
te verander.

Ek onthou, op 'n goeie dag het hy ten  opsigte  van  immigrasiehowe  met  'n
voorstel  van  die  DP  gekom.  So,  ek  weet  nie  waaroor  hy   kla   nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek wil hom net graag  herinner  dat  hy  dieselfde  gedoen
het.  Dit  is  binne  die  reëls  van  die  Parlement  om   dit   te   doen.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Dit  is  egter  jammer   dat   die   wetsontwerp   nie   vroeër   deur   die
portefeuljekomitee bespreek is nie.  Die  departement  moet  ongelukkig  ook
skuld dra vir die gesloer met die wetsontwerp. Ek is  van  mening  dat  ons,
indien dit vroeër aan ons voorgelê is, 'n beter  produk  aan  die  Parlement
sou kon voorgelê het.

'n Spesiale woord van dank aan die  nuwe  voorsitter,  mnr  Scott,  wat  die
afgelope week of twee die leiding oorgeneem het. Hy  het  binne  enkele  dae
die komitee op 'n nuwe pad geplaas. Ons sien daarna uit om  in  die  toekoms
met hom saam te werk.

Die belangrikste beginsel wat die wetsontwerp vervat, is  die  volgende:  om
die koms van vreemdelinge na die RSA te reguleer, hul verblyf  in  ons  land
te reël, en hul vertrek uit die land te reguleer.

Tesame daarmee, moet die  Wetsontwerp  op  Immigrasie  verbruikersvriendelik
wees.  Die  regulasies  betreffende  die  binnekoms  van  vreemdelinge   met
spesiale vaardighede moet dus vereenvoudig word. Rompslomp moet  uitgeskakel
word.

Die wetsontwerp moet ook aan die grondwetlike  vereistes,  wat  die  Handves
van  Regte  insluit,  voldoen.  Dan  is  daar  nog  die  uitspraak  van  die
Grondwetlike Hof, naamlik dat die Parlement,  voor  2  Junie  vanjaar,  nuwe
wetgewing oor immigrasie moet aanneem. Dit is dus die  swaard  van  Damocles
wat oor ons koppe hang.

Suid-Afrika het, aan  die  ander  kant,  ekonomiese  ontwikkeling  nodig  en
werkgeleenthede moet geskep word om die  miljoene  werkloses  weer  hoop  te
gee. Ter ondersteuning van my saak haal ek graag  aan  uit  Business  SA  se
voorlegging aan ons portefeuljekomitee:


  In the summary of the United Nations  economic  report  on  Africa  2000,
  paragraph 39 reads: Any improvement in African economic performance  will
  depend on the extent to which the continent becomes integrated  into  the
  world economy.

Dan gaan hierdie verslag voort, en sê:


  This entails a flow of commerce and  skills,  remembering  that  when  we
  import a skilled foreigner, he or she comes with the  capital,  knowledge
  and resources that his or her country of origin has invested  on  him  or
  her, and we get this free.

Ek glo dat indien ons daarin kan slaag om hoogs geskoolde mense na ons  land
te lok, werkloosheid uitgeskakel of verlig kan word. Werkloosheid kan  egter
nie oornag uitgeskakel word nie, maar ons moet wel alles in ons vermoë  doen
om ekonomiese ontwikkeling te stimuleer. Soos die  verslag  meld,  bring  'n
geskoolde vreemdeling sy kennis gratis na Suid-Afrika.

Ons het entrepreneurs nodig. Vreemdelinge kan ook, soos nou  die  geval  is,
hulp verleen om opleiding aan ongeskoolde Suid-Afrikaners  te  verskaf.  Een
van die redes waarom ek  na  ekonomiese  ontwikkeling  en  die  werwing  van
immigrante verwys, is die feit dat daar wêreldwyd gepoog word  om  geskoolde
persone te werf.

As  'n  voorbeeld,  die  Europese  Unie  probeer  om   jaarliks   1,6miljoen
immigrante te werf. Daar is ander lande ook. Ek wil ook verwys na  die  feit
dat Suid-Afrika ver geleë is van Europa, die Ooste  en  Amerika.  Dit  bring
mee dat omstandighede in ons land  baie  ideaal  gemaak  moet  word  vir  'n
vreemdeling. Ons moet dus poog om alle struikelblokke uit die weg te ruim.

Ek hoop van harte dat die nuwe maatreëls, veral dié in klousules 15  en  19,
vir die sakesektor aanvaarbaar sal wees, en dat dit geskoolde immigrante  na
die RSA sal lok. Die uitreiking van besigheids- en werkpermitte gaan  beslis
'n sleutelrol speel om te voldoen aan die vereistes van die sakesektor,  wat
ook deur die Nuwe NP onderskryf word.  Die  spoed  en  die  effektiewe  wyse
waarop werkpermitte aan veral geskoolde immigrante  uitgereik  gaan  word  -
dit word uiteengesit in klousule 19(5) - gaan bepaal of  ons  die  doelwitte
kan bereik ten opsigte van werkgeleenthede.

Dit is dan ook die rede waarom die Nuwe NP met die ANC  saamwerk  ter  wille
van die skep van 'n beter toekoms. Die interaksie met die  ANC  ten  opsigte
van dié wetsontwerp het na my mening goeie vrugte afgewerp. Diegene wat  met
my verskil, kan gerus die  oorspronklike  wetsontwerp  gaan  bestudeer.  Die
heffings het weggeval, maar  daar  is  onder  andere  die  kwotabepaling  in
klousule 19(1) wat nog krap.

Ek hoop dat dié bepaling in die toekoms geskrap sal word, want die  Nuwe  NP
steun dié maatreël voorwaardelik. Die  toepassing  van  hierdie  wetsontwerp
gaan egter die deurslag gee, en die Minister en sy departement  sal  hierin,
uit die aard van die saak, die sleutelrol speel. Ek hoop  die  agb  Minister
gaan ook die regulasies wat  ingevolge  die  wetsontwerp  uitgevaardig  moet
word in 'n gees van verbruikersvriendelikheid skrywe.

Ek het dit voorheen gesê en ek wil dit herhaal: die Nuwe  NP  wil  graag  'n
positiewe bydrae lewer. Ek wil ook graag sê kundiges  met  wie  ek  oor  die
voorgestelde wetgewing gepraat het, het ernstige  bedenkings  gehad  daaroor
of hierdie wetsontwerp aan die verwagtings gaan voldoen.

Verder sal die departement ook baie aandag aan  'n  ander  aspek  moet  gee,
naamlik die opleiding van amptenare om die wetsontwerp doeltreffend  toe  te
pas. Uiteindelik moet ons Suid-Afrika eerste stel. Die kiesers  het  ons  na
die Parlement gestuur sodat hulle die wenners kan wees en nie  ons  nie.  Ek
steun die  wetsontwerp  namens  die  Nuwe  NP.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Madam Speaker, it is  a  pleasant  privilege  for  me  to
participate in the discussion on this Bill on immigration on behalf  of  the
New NP. Before I get to the text of my speech, I  would  just  like  to  say
that the  hon  member  Mr  Grobler  stated  here  that  the  majority  party
arbitrarily made proposals to change the Bill.

I remember, one good day he came with a proposal from the DP with regard  to
immigration courts. So,  I  do  not  know  what  he  is  complaining  about.
[Interjections.] I would just like to  remind  him  that  he  did  the  same
thing. It is within the rules of Parliament to do so. [Interjections.]

However, it is a pity that the Bill  was  not  discussed  by  the  portfolio
committee sooner. The department must unfortunately also bear the blame  for
the delay with the Bill. I am of the opinion that, if it had been  submitted
to us earlier, we could have submitted a better product to Parliament.

A special word of thanks to the new chairperson, Mr  Scott,  who  has  taken
over the leadership during the past week or two. Within days he  placed  the
committee on a new path. We look forward to working with him in future.
The most important principle contained in the  Bill  is  the  following:  to
regulate  the  arrival  of  foreigners  in  the   RSA,   to   manage   their
accommodation in our country, and  to  regulate  their  departure  from  the
country.

Together  with  this,  the  Immigration  Act  must  be  user-friendly.   The
regulations regarding the entry  of  foreigners  with  special  skills  must
therefore be simplified. Red tape must be eliminated.

The Bill must also meet the constitutional requirements, which  include  the
Bill of Rights. Then there is also the ruling by the  Constitutional  Court,
namely that before 2 June this year Parliament must  adopt  new  legislation
on immigration. That is therefore the Sword of  Damocles  which  hangs  over
our heads.

On  the  other  hand,  South  Africa  needs  economic  development  and  job
opportunities must be created to give the millions of unemployed  hope  once
again. In support of my case I  would  like  to  quote  from  Business  SA's
submission to our portfolio committee:


  In the summary of the United Nations  economic  report  on  Africa  2000,
  paragraph 39 reads: Any improvement in African economic performance  will
  depend on the extent to which the continent becomes integrated  into  the
  world economy.

This report then goes on to say:


  This entails a flow of commerce and  skills,  remembering  that  when  we
  import a skilled foreigner, he or she comes with the  capital,  knowledge
  and resources that his or her country of origin has invested  on  him  or
  her, and we get this free.

I believe that if we can succeed in attracting highly skilled people to  our
country unemployment can be eradicated or alleviated. However,  unemployment
cannot be eradicated overnight but we must still do everything in our  power
to stimulate  economic  development.  As  the  report  mentions,  a  skilled
foreigner brings his knowledge to South Africa free of charge.

We need entrepreneurs. Foreigners can also, as is  now  the  case,  help  to
provide training to unskilled South  Africans.  One  of  the  reasons  I  am
referring to economic development and the recruitment of immigrants  is  the
fact that worldwide an attempt is being made to recruit skilled persons.

For example, the European Union is trying to recruit 1,6 million  immigrants
annually. There are also other countries. I would also like to refer to  the
fact that South Africa is situated  far  away  from  Europe,  the  East  and
America. This means that circumstances in our country  must  be  made  ideal
for a foreigner. We must therefore try to remove all obstacles.

I sincerely hope that the new measures, particularly  those  in  clauses  15
and 19, are going to be acceptable to the business  sector,  and  that  they
will attract skilled immigrants to the RSA.  The  issuing  of  business  and
work permits is certainly going to play a key role to meet the  requirements
of the business sector, which are also endorsed by the  New  NP.  The  speed
and the effective manner in which work permits are going  to  be  issued  to
skilled immigrants in particular - this is set out in  clause  19(5)  -  are
going to determine whether we can achieve the objectives with regard to  job
opportunities.
This is then also the reason why the New NP is  co-operating  with  the  ANC
for the sake of the creation of a better future. The  interaction  with  the
ANC with regard to this Bill has, in my opinion,  borne  much  fruit.  Those
who disagree with me are welcome to study  the  original  Bill.  The  levies
have fallen away, but there is, inter alia, the quota stipulation in  clause
19(1) which is still a thorny issue.

I hope that this provision will be removed in future,  because  the  New  NP
supports this measure provisionally. However,  the  implementation  of  this
Bill is going to tip the scale, and the Minister  and  his  department  are,
naturally, going to play the key role in this regard. I hope  that  the  hon
the Minister is also going to write the regulations which must be issued  in
terms of the Bill in a spirit of user-friendliness.

I have said it before and I want to repeat it: The  New  NP  would  like  to
make a positive contribution. I would also like to  say  that  experts  with
whom I discussed the proposed legislation had serious doubts as  to  whether
this Bill is going to meet expectations.

Furthermore, the  department  will  also  have  to  give  a  great  deal  of
attention to another aspect, namely the training of officials  to  implement
the Bill effectively. At the end of the day we must put South Africa  first.
The voters sent us to Parliament so that they could be the winners, and  not
us. I support the Bill on behalf of the New NP. [Applause.]]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, the Bill before the  House
will not be remembered for its content. Chances are  much  better  that  the
Bill will be remembered for all  the  wrong  reasons.  Eight  years  in  the
making, the Immigration Bill was surrounded by controversy. The  journey  of
this Bill is a good example of how not to deal with legislation.

The deliberate delays by the ANC in starting with the deliberations  on  the
Bill in the portfolio committee resulted in the committee having to rush  to
meet the Constitutional Court deadlines. It  meant  that  as  late  as  last
night a final  Bill  was  not  ready  for  scrutiny  by  committee  members.
Instead, an unrevised version of the Bill was distributed.

This further contributed to adopting less than ideal options  because  there
was not sufficient time to deliberate on alternatives. If  deliberations  on
the Bill had started when the Bill was introduced,  there  would  have  been
time to ask the department to redraft certain sections of the Bill.

There can be no claim that policy issues regarding  this  Bill  were  ironed
out. And it would be difficult for anyone to give a short and  comprehensive
answer on what the immigration policy of South Africa is,  this  despite  it
being eight years in the making.

The department is not without blame either. The  approach  was  one  of  not
wanting to give an inch and of regarding  any  suggested  changes  as  being
ludicrous. That did not assist in creating an atmosphere of co-operation.

Cabinet's approval of the Bill while it clearly did not agree, whether  this
was communicated or not, was also a further frustration that  the  committee
had to deal with. With as many as 11 Government agencies  affected  by  this
Bill, everyone accepted that it would be difficult to satisfy all.  However,
after eight years, it is certainly not  unreasonable  to  expect  that  even
Cabinet should have been more united in its approach. To the  contrary,  the
committee was left to sort out those differences that Cabinet was unable  or
unwilling to address at that level. This is an untenable situation.

Let me get into some details of the Bill. The UDM is concerned about  clause
33 of the Bill, which deals with the inspectorate. We support the  need  for
such an inspectorate in order  to  enforce  the  Bill.  However,  we  remain
uncomfortable with the absence of the need  for  a  warrant  when  executing
certain seizure activities.

This clause also  allows  for  the  use  of  necessary  force  in  executing
inspections. The UDM would like to  express  its  concern  and  reservations
over this. We know how difficult it is for the SAPS to deal  with  the  need
for necessary force, and we would like to know how a department that is  not
receiving training on this is going to deal with it.

Allowing detention of illegal foreigners for a period of from 30 to 90  days
without a warrant is also an issue of great concern to  the  UDM.  While  we
understand that the process requires time, we  believe  strongly  that  this
provision  can  constitutionally  be  challenged.  The  UDM  believes   that
deportation should be done as quickly as possible.

Regarding the issue of work permits and the quota system, we would  like  to
urge that the system rather be used  as  an  enabling  tool  and  not  as  a
restrictive measure. The quota system might  not  be  the  ideal  tool,  but
there were no -  and  we  must  emphasise  this  -  acceptable  alternatives
presented either. We would urge the Minister and his two colleagues  to  use
this rather as a means test than a restrictive measure.

The quotas should be determined with the assistance  of  business.  Once  we
have determined the quotas, it is also important that we  then  go  out  and
market that need to the communities out there, and  actively  try  to  bring
people to South Africa in order to fulfil those needs.

The UDM asks that its objection to clause 40,  dealing  with  accommodation,
be noted. We are in support of this Bill, but  we  believe  that  this  Bill
will be back with Parliament for changes earlier rather than later.

We would also like to take the opportunity to thank the new chairperson  for
the way in which he took the committee forward  in  dealing  with  what  was
clearly a very controversial Bill. [Applause.]

Ms M M MAUNYE: Madam Speaker,  Ministers,  Deputy  Ministers,  hon  members,
comrades, the challenge that faces our country  in  the  current  globalised
world is to  transform  a  racially  motivated  immigration  system  into  a
nonracial and rational response to the objective needs of the country.

The new immigration regime that we seek to establish must be in  a  position
to achieve at least the following four  objectives:  enhance  the  country's
integration into and competitiveness within the global economy; further  the
process of regional integration and development within the Southern  African
Development Community; generate economic growth and  job  opportunities  for
people of the  region;  and  provide  the  ability  to  improve  the  living
standards of our people in the country and the  region.  The  Bill  that  is
before us goes a long way in ensuring that the four objectives stated  above
are realised.

There are basically three areas that I want to focus on in the Bill that  is
before us today. The first one is the issue of permits.  This  is  critical,
to know who is in the country and who is out  of  the  country.  The  second
issue is the question of obligations and duties. We are in  the  process  of
building a country that will  foster  public-private  participation  between
Government, civil society and business. The third issue is the  question  of
immigration practitioners. The Department of Home Affairs  should  know  who
are the people are that are in this  business.  This  is  a  very  lucrative
business that can attract all sorts of individuals.

There are number of permits that the Bill suggests. I want to  focus  mainly
on four types of permits. The first one is  the  asylum  permit  that  deals
with the issue of refugees. The second  one  is  the  relative  permit  that
seeks to facilitate and enable people of blood relation to visit each  other
with ease. The third one is the study permit that allows people  from  other
countries to study at our institutions of higher learning.  The  fourth  one
is the  retired  person's  permit.  This  permit  seeks  to  facilitate  and
encourage retired persons that will add value to  our  economy,  and  inject
skills that are required and share those skills with our people.

Let me address the asylum permit. The birth  of  democracy  brought  us  new
challenges, some of which  were  expected  and  some  of  which  were  never
expected. As a result we were not able to handle them in a proper  way.  Our
reintegration into the international community brought new  responsibilities
and obligations. We signed conventions and protocols that set the rules  and
regulations on how to handle refugees.

As a country, we have to observe these rules. Refugees did not  leave  their
respective countries by choice but were forced by  circumstances  that  were
beyond their  control,  in  most  cases.  They  are  often  people  who  are
destitute and  poor.  Their  countries  are  ravaged  by  war  or  political
persecutions. This kind of permit is granted to people such  as  these,  not
to any other person.

South  African  society  in  general  has  a  tendency  to  confuse  illegal
immigrants and refugees. There is a clear distinction between the two  types
of people. In terms  of  our  international  obligations,  refugees  can  be
granted some sort of travel document once  their  refugee  status  has  been
ascertained.

As members of this Parliament, we need to make  an  effort  to  educate  the
public about the differences and obligations that we have in  terms  of  the
protocols and  conventions  that  we  have  signed  with  the  international
community. Despite the situation, the refugee  community  has  something  to
offer the country. Some of the refugees have skills that the country needs.

Regarding relative permits,  the  European  powers,  when  they  partitioned
Africa at the Berlin Conference, did not  take  care  of  people  and  their
jurisdiction. This resulted in a situation where people of the  same  family
and tribe find themselves  living  in  two  or  three  different  countries,
something that they had not even thought about. All of a sudden,  they  have
to ask for a permit to visit their relatives who happen  to  live  in  these
countries. This situation has inhibited the movement of people of  the  same
family. The kind of permit that is envisaged is  one  that  will  facilitate
the movement of people without any of the hindrance and difficulty  that  is
now being experienced.

On the issue of study permits, I would like to say that,  about  four  years
ago, this august House  gave  the  Government  a  mandate  to  sign  a  SADC
protocol on education that seeks to encourage the movement of academics  and
students within the region. This movement  of  students  within  the  region
needs to be regulated. This clause seeks to address that. However,  it  does
not only focus on students from the region, but  also  on  foreign  students
who intend to study in the country.

We live in a global village where one of the outcomes  of  globalisation  is
the free flow of ideas among people of different countries and  cultures  in
order to enrich ourselves. In the same vein, the  institutions  of  learning
have an obligation to continually inform  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs
about the status of a student concerned and whether he or she is still  with
the institution. This is critical to ensure that we keep track  of  everyone
in the country who is not a South African citizen.

As regards retired people's permits, many people will wonder  why  we  allow
retired  persons  to  come  to  our  country  instead  of  people  who  will
contribute to the economic  growth  of  the  country.  Firstly,  I  need  to
clarify the point that a retired person does not necessarily mean  a  person
who is over the age of 60, poor, and intends to  benefit  from  our  pension
scheme. It is far from  this.  In  most  countries,  particularly  developed
countries, people retire at an early age because they can afford to  do  so,
unlike in countries such as ours. A  person  over  the  age  of  60  is  not
necessarily near his or her grave. Those people, in most  cases,  will  have
skills and the necessary capital that they can inject into  the  economy  in
the form of investment. Secondly,  these  people  normally  have  a  regular
income in their countries that sustains  them  for  life.  The  clause  also
insists that such persons must provide proof from the country of his or  her
origin that he or she  has  the  benefits,  for  example,  such  as  minimum
payment for the rest of his or her life.

I now want to focus on the area of obligation and duties. We must  not  view
this section as draconian by placing obligations and duties  on  individuals
and companies that have foreigners in their ranks. The people who run  those
institutions  must  understand  that  in   the   light   of   public-private
partnerships which seek to encourage close co-operation between  people  and
their government to realise our objective of a better life for all.
In terms of this clause, companies are obliged  to  employ  people  who  are
legally in the country. Should they not  observe  the  law,  the  department
will take legal action against them. They  will  also  have  to  inform  the
department about the status of their employees.

The issue of accommodation is one area  in  which  illegal  activities  take
place. The urban decay that we see in  cities  like  Johannesburg  today  is
partly the result of the fact that there has not been  a  systematic  record
of people accommodated in certain institutions. Most of  those  institutions
find themselves being overrun by international  syndicates  that  use  those
buildings as springboards to conduct criminal  activities.  We  need  to  do
something about this situation. We cannot allow it to  continue  as  it  is.
This clause seeks to address this problem.

The last issue that I want to talk about  is  the  question  of  immigration
practitioners. With this clause, the department seeks to ensure  that  there
is control over the people ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I regret that your time has expired, hon member.

Ms M M MAUNYE: We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, the ACDP  shares  the  Minister's
concerns and frustrations, particularly regarding the quota  system  adopted
in the Bill. The ACDP's  principal  opposition  to  the  Bill  is,  however,
founded on the extension  of  the  definition  of  the  word  ``spouse''  to
include a party to a permanent heterosexual or homosexual  relationship.  We
believe that this is finessing into legislation a  secular  humanist  agenda
which is directly in contrast with the Judaeo-Christian family  values  that
we, as Christian democrats, hold dear.

The ACDP appreciates, however, that the extension of this  definition  is  a
result of the decision  in  the  National  Coalition  for  Gay  and  Lesbian
Equality case, and that the Bill would be unconstitutional  if  those  words
were not added. The mere fact that the Constitutional Court has made such  a
ruling does not, however, result in that ruling  being  morally  acceptable.
It all depends on one's particular world view, ours being  a  biblical  one.
In this regard, we particularly question  the  need  to  grant  heterosexual
unmarried partners the same rights as married partners, as  the  former  can
quite legitimately get married in terms of our existing law.

Implementation will also present immense  difficulties,  as  the  department
will only be able to rely upon the ipse dixit  of  the  parties  themselves.
How will one combat partners fraudulently stating, even on  affidavit,  that
they are in such  permanent  relationships  in  order  to  obtain  permanent
residence permits? Mr Errol Naidoo, in a  recent  letter  published  in  the
media, convincingly argues that the erosion of family values has  led  to  a
moral degeneration in South Africa. We  share  his  view  that  the  correct
strategy to reverse the current cultural  trend  of  moral  degeneration  in
South Africa must primarily be to  support  the  superiority  of  monogamous
heterosexual marriage and the family as a  social  ideal  and  to  pass  the
necessary laws to protect those institutions.

In conclusion, we wish to state that the extended definition  of  ``spouse''
as contained in this Bill does not serve this purpose, and consequently  the
ACDP cannot support  this  Bill,  notwithstanding  the  very  many  positive
elements contained therein.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, hon members, the intent of  the  Immigration
Bill before us is to  empower  the  department  to  issue  permits  allowing
foreigners to enter, sojourn and conduct  certain  activities  within  South
Africa as expeditiously as possible. On the other hand, it seeks to  prevent
xenophobia and uphold human rights. The Bill also seeks to  make  it  easier
to recruit much-needed skills to the country.

It is unfortunate that a piece of legislation  with  such  noble  intentions
was the subject of protracted and vitriolic debate. The recruitment of much-
needed skills to the country is  being  misconstrued  in  some  quarters  as
denying work opportunities to local  people.  We  are  all  aware  that  the
Director-General of the Department of Trade and Industry made it  abundantly
clear that people are not  being  employed  because  they  are  unemployable
owing to lack of skills. We  therefore  need  skills  to  make  the  economy
function properly.

An innovative piece of legislation requires that those  who  will  implement
it be retrained.  As  such,  provision  has  to  be  made  for  transitional
arangements and even restructuring of the department. The  Equality  Act  of
2000 and the South African Weather Service Act of 2001 are but two  examples
of pieces of legislation that have sections dealing with these  issues,  and
this Parliament passed them without raising a finger on those sections.

We commend the Minister of Home Affairs and the  Minister  for  Justice  and
Constitutional  Development  for  having  found   common   ground   on   the
establishment of immigration courts, as proposed in the  Bill.  One  wonders
why there was such hype about this matter  in  the  first  place,  as  other
state departments such as Labour, the SA Revenue Service and Transport  have
specialised courts to expedite resolutions in  respect  of  cases  involving
them.

We in the UCDP would appeal to members to be  consistent  in  passing  laws.
Some Bills should not be stifled and delayed by  scrutiny  that  borders  on
paranoia, while others are passed with ease,  only  to  come  back  to  this
House two or three months later to be amended.

In the best interests of South Africa, we  in  the  UCDP  will  support  the
Bill, even in its present form. After all ...

... fa koko e seo, go jewa luribisi. [... half a  loaf  is  better  than  no
bread at all.] [Applause.]

Dr S  E  M  PHEKO:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister  of  Home  Affairs,  this
Immigration Bill is intended to provide for the regulation of  admission  of
persons, their residence in, and their departure from our  country  and,  of
course, matters connected therewith.

Because of the high  rate  of  crime  in  our  country,  some  of  which  is
committed by immigrants,  it  is  important  that  our  immigration  law  is
tightened to  prevent  foreigners  who  come  here  with  the  intention  of
committing crime.

Our immigration laws must also ensure that human rights in this country  are
not taken advantage of by criminals. I am referring to laws  which  make  it
easy for immigrants to contract marriages of convenience.

Although  this  Bill  does  not  meet   international   standards,   it   is
nevertheless an improvement on the old Aliens Control Act.

For effective implementation of our immigration laws, Parliament  must  take
care that it does  not  make  it  difficult  for  the  current  Minister  to
function effectively, because Ministers change.

Clause 19 deals with work permits. It looks as  if  it  will  cause  endless
delays, and will need a review later.

It is regrettable, of course, that this Bill is surrounded  by  a  cloud  of
controversy in that  the  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  seems  to  have  been
frustrated.

National unity and democracy demand that good  ideas  are  listened  to  and
used for the benefit of our country, regardless of who  has  proposed  them,
especially if he or she is a Minister. Anything less than  this  is  nothing
but pseudo-democracy and a sign of fascism.

The PAC will vote for this Bill with reservations,  especially  with  regard
to clauses 19 and 33.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  South  Africa  has  earned
itself a reputation as a safe haven.  We  have  done  this,  certainly,  not
because of our horrific past, but because of who we  are  today.  We  are  a
nation of the people for the people. Our main priority  is  the  people,  as
with a child that needs care and love. What person would  not  be  drawn  to
us? We also have a fast-growing economy, sights and beauties. And being  the
rainbow nation, which person around the world does not share our heritage?

However much we enjoy the revenue tourism brings in, immigrants  can  hardly
be catered  for.  We  have  escalating  levels  of  unemployment  among  the
citizenry, and our constitutional commitment is to them first.

The influx of foreigners immigrating to South Africa is causing  panic,  and
xenophobia is an expected reaction.

On our televisions we have witnessed the illegal dealings of  foreigners  in
our country. We need to put a stop to this.

It would be easy to say that we should stop  immigration,  but  we  have  to
bear in mind that we should not stereotype and assume  that  all  immigrants
to our country are criminals. That would be treacherous and inhumane.

Hopefully the department will be  able  to  meet  with  the  departments  of
safety and inculcate more rigid measures to sift  through  the  bag.  Health
risks are also noted. This  statement  seems  discriminatory;  however,  our
first priority is our citizens. The MF  notes  that  letting  in  immigrants
does not cater for  the  investment  of  foreign  currency  and  many  other
positive aspects. We are confident that the department  will  institute  the
Bill efficiently and effectively.

The MF supports the Immigration Bill. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the AEB is distressed by the way in  which  this
important Bill was handled and  vitally  changed  at  the  last  minute,  as
described by hon Minister Buthelezi to this House today.

The hon the  Minister  should  be  assured  of  the  sympathy  of  the  AEB.
[Interjections.] I am talking to the Minister, hon  member!  [Laughter.]  We
have great understanding for him in his particular position as a  member  of
Government and of the opposition. As we say in Afrikaans, ``Dit  is  net  'n
kat wat gelyktydig kan vry en baklei.'' [Only a cat can kiss  and  fight  at
the same time.] [Laughter.]
Die  oorhoofse  bedoeling  van  hierdie  wetsontwerp  moet   gesteun   word.
Navorsing het getoon dat hoewel daar groot werkloosheid in  Suid-Afrika  is,
daar weer in sekere gespesialiseerde kategorieë  groot  tekorte  is.  Daarom
moet dit vir voornemende immigrante met  hierdie  vaardighede  makliker,  en
nie moeiliker nie, gemaak word om dit hier te kan aanwend.

Daar kan besware wees dat vreemdelinge ons gaan oorstroom en ons  werk  gaan
vat, maar hierdie gevaar bestaan by onwettige immigrasies, nie by mense  wat
die land deur die voordeur binnekom nie.

Die AEB ondersteun ook die agb Minister in sy besware  teen  die  drie  ter-
elfder-ure wysigings. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

The overall intention of this Bill must be  supported.  Research  has  shown
that although there is unemployment in South Africa, there  are  also  great
shortages in certain specialised categories. That is why it should  be  made
easier,  and  not  more  difficult,  for  prospective  immigrants  with  the
necessary skills to employ them here.

There may be objections that foreigners might flood us and  take  our  jobs,
but this peril exists with illegal immigrations, not  with  people  entering
the country through the front door.

The AEB also supports the hon the Minister in  his  objections  against  the
three eleventh-hour amendments.]

There is one common denominator in all three of these ANC  amendments:  that
of bigger instead of smaller government. Surely the market,  those  who  are
working with these shortages, should know best which skills,  and  how  many
people, we need. It is not for  Government  to  determine  this  by  way  of
quotas.

Furthermore,  the  AEB  is  opposed  to  the  centralisation  of  Government
functions,  as  reflected  in   the   new   draft,   and   would   opt   for
decentralisation and outsourcing of functions where possible. Also,  on  the
third late amendment, we would prefer that Government did not play the  role
of the client's chartered accountant.

Then, of course, the AEB supports the ACDP in their  objection  to  the  new
definition of ``spouse''. Certainly,  these  couples  could  not  be  turned
away, but it is not necessary  effectively  to  rewrite  the  definition  of
marriage in every Bill.

Hierdie wetsontwerp sal weer verander moet word,  maar  daarsonder  kan  ons
ook nie. Daar is krake in die wetsontwerp, en in  die  manier  hoe  die  hek
oopgemaak word, maar hy moet nou oopgemaak word. Daarom steun  die  AEB  met
voorbehoud die wetsontwerp. [Applous.] (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[This Bill will have to be changed  again,  but  we  cannot  go  without  it
either. There are cracks in the Bill, and in the manner in  which  the  gate
is opened, but it has to be opened now. That is why  the  AEB  supports  the
Bill with reservations. [Applause.]]

Mr M U KALAKO: Madam Speaker, hon members, I am sure it  would  have  served
him well if the hon Mr Aucamp could have attended  the  portfolio  committee
meetings. I am sure we would have benefited from his presence.

The legislation we are repealing had its roots in  the  apartheid  era,  and
had all the trappings of racist ideology. Its basic principles stemmed  from
1913, shortly after the unification of South Africa. Then it  was  meant  to
keep out  undesirable  fortune-hunting  citizens  from  Europe,  Canada  and
America. Although, then, the apartheid  element  was  not  built  into  this
legislation, it was embodied in the Black Urban Areas Act, the Black  Labour
Act and elements of the Influx Control Act.

Through this legislation we know that many  of  our  freedom  fighters  were
declared ``prohibited persons'' in the Republic of South Africa.  They  were
condemned  to  the  homelands.  Therefore,  the  process   of   making   new
immigration legislation must take into  account  the  extent  to  which  the
immigration policy was used by the apartheid government as  a  mechanism  to
enforce widespread abuses, including denying  black  people  the  rights  to
citizenship and freedom of  movement,  and  subjecting  migrant  workers  in
particular to widespread labour abuses.

What does the new immigration legislation seek to do? It seeks to reflect  a
shift towards an approach  that  is  clearly  based  on  respect  for  human
rights, as set out in our Constitution and international law.  It  seeks  to
create a new and modern piece of legislation that is  in  keeping  with  our
constitutional democracy. It also seeks to put in place measures  to  combat
racism and xenophobia, and to facilitate the attraction of  investment  into
the country. Above all it seeks  to  provide  a  service  to  South  African
citizens  and  legal  residents  by  making  sure  that,  in  our  migration
legislation, there are no loopholes for transnational  organised  crime  and
illegal migration. The Bill deals with the effects of  illegal  migrants  on
unemployment and the combating of  corruption  in  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs.

To deal with the above-mentioned challenges that face  the  department,  the
legislation  creates  provisions  under  the  enforcement   and   monitoring
clauses. This Bill, as tabled before Parliament, gives  definite  guidelines
and policy so as to minimise the discretionary decisions of  the  officials.
In this regard, the  officials  of  the  department  will  have  to  undergo
training which will assist them in the implementation of the Bill.  It  also
makes simple and less complex  the  processes  of  handling  immigrants  and
refugees. By giving certainty to  the  process,  it  limits  and  eliminates
discretion by officials.

The Bill has taken into account constitutional and legislative  mandates  of
other  departments  on  those  issues  and  permits  that  relate  to  other
departments such as Labour,  Trade  and  Industry,  the  Defence  Force  and
others.

In order to cater for implementation and transition,  mechanisms  have  been
provided  for  under  the   regulation-making   clauses   and   transitional
provisions. These two clauses will enable the department  to  implement  the
provisions of the  Bill.  The  Bill  has,  by  all  means,  tried  to  avoid
ambiguity and inconsistency. It has, instead, endeavoured to be specific  in
its explanations so as not to be everything to everyone.

In conclusion, I would like to say that  we  know  that  this  Bill  is  not
perfect. But, it is something that we can live with. For  this  reason,  the
legislation cannot remain static. It  will  change  from  time  to  time  to
accommodate new demands, developments and trends. It will keep  evolving  in
order to remain relevant in the changing times so that  it  makes  provision
for the new challenges. This legislation is implementable  and  enforceable.
All we need to do is make sure  that  we  provide  the  department  with  an
adequate budget to implement it.
Lastly, I want to commend the department for  its  participation  throughout
the deliberations on the Bill and  for  its  consistent  attendance  of  the
committee meetings. I want, in particular, to commend the role played by  Dr
Ambrosini in actually engaging the department throughout  the  deliberations
on the Bill. We commend that. I  also  want  to  commend  the  Minister  and
remind him that when he opened the discussions, he was the first  person  to
appear before us, and he actually said to us: ``The Bill is  before  you  to
tear it into pieces as you deem fit as a committee.'' [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  I  wish  to  thank  all  hon
members who have participated  in  this  debate  today  for  their  valuable
contributions, but I wish to give a very  special  word  of  thanks  to  the
chairman of the committee, Mr Scott, who, in spite of his youth, has  spoken
many  words  of  wisdom,  normally  associated  with  people  of   my   age.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

I am glad that he stressed that the  perspective  in  which  the  debate  on
migration control should be cast was that of globalisation, because we  need
to ensure that this commitment to the perspective of globalisation  in  fact
becomes a living reality in the further  stages  of  policy  formulation  on
this matter.  In  respect  of  the  hon  member's  comment  on  preferential
treatment on a regional basis, future  policy  development  on  this  matter
will be challenging and I think  we  need  to  take  into  account  the  new
international framework established by the General  Agreement  on  Trade  in
Services, which limits some of our options in respect of migration control.

I wish to highlight the hon member's remarks  on  our  department's  needing
additional  resources,  which  will  be  the  key  to  the  success  of  the
implementation of this Bill. I wish also to  echo  his  sentiments  when  he
says that we need to work together. I can assure him that I look forward  to
a fruitful interaction with him. I wish to take  our  combined  efforts  and
joint commitment to make the Immigration Bill  a  reality.  The  Immigration
Bill will require a complex  process  of  implementation,  as  we  can  see,
including regulations, which will not  be  possible  without  the  full  and
dedicated support of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs.

We need to ensure that  all  stakeholders  contribute  to  this  process  of
implementation and work closely with us in the drafting of regulations.  For
this purpose we need to set aside differences and  join  hands  across  both
sides of the aisle. For this reason I am sure that our good  colleague,  the
hon Mr Grobler, will set aside the grudges at the many delays and  obstacles
placed in the path of the passage of the Immigration Bill, which he  rightly
recollected for us, of course, and will let bygones be bygones.

Mr Grobler spoke a very harsh truth - no wonder there were  interjections  -
and said many things  that,  unfortunately,  are  true,  even  if  not  very
palatable. However, that is the past - a past which  we  shall  not  forget,
but which we now must move beyond. I hope  that  the  member's  contribution
will be taken into account  as  we  move  into  the  implementation  of  the
Immigration Act. I thank the  hon  member  Mr  Grobler  for  his  insightful
remarks and hope that  he  will  continue  to  contribute  his  strength  of
intellect to future debates on immigration control.

Neither of us knows what is involved in  setting  up  a  quota  system,  but
perhaps by working together we will be able to figure it out  and  fill  the
extensive blanks in the mandate which my department is  now  receiving  from
this Parliament. We need everybody's support to come up with a credible  and
acceptable quota system. I also wish to  thank  His  Royal  Highness  Prince
Nhlanhla Zulu for his remarks, which also carry  wisdom.  I  think  we  must
heed conciliatory words, which highlight the need to look at  the  glass  as
half full rather than half empty.

I thank Prince Zulu and other members of the two teams which negotiated  the
resolution of the political impasse which was created by the May  9  redraft
of the Bill by the majority  party.  The  prince  has  highlighted  how  the
negotiations avoided  a  crisis  and  the  possibility  that  what  we  have
considered today would have been a very absurd  Bill.  His  words  highlight
the commitment of my party to avoid conflicts and to seek  further  progress
on the path of reconciliation through negotiations.

I also wish to thank the former chairperson of the  committee,  the  hon  Mr
Mokoena, who correctly remarked that South Africa had  never  had  to  apply
its mind to an open policy debate on migration, which is true. I  never  met
this open mind, even in the home affairs portfolio  committee  when  he  was
chairing it.

Today we have just begun this debate, and  if  we  are  to  develop  quotas,
there would be harsh policy confrontations and sharp differences of  opinion
on what is needed and how ajar our immigration door should be kept.

Unfortunately, the hon member  misread  the  original  clause  40  which  he
quoted, relating to immigration courts, and the  remarks  he  made  in  that
respect are  muddled,  with  due  respect  to  him,  and  both  legally  and
factually incorrect. I suggest that he may wish to look into the issue  more
analytically to enhance his understanding of the matter.

The reformulation of the provision on the immigration court was the  product
of  discussions  between  the  Department  of  Justice,  my  department,  my
colleague the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  and
myself.

Moreover, the remarks that the hon member Mr Mokoena made  relating  to  the
original formulation of the investigative unit are plainly wrong, and it  is
incorrect to state that  any  power  of  the  investigative  unit  has  been
changed, when, in fact, the only change affects the name  of  the  unit  and
none of its substance. In  other  words,  it  is  just  a  cosmetic  change.
Moreover, the notion that these were Home Affairs courts that I  was  trying
to create is absurd.

However, his comments highlight that unless we have administrative  capacity
for the enforcement of immigration law, our debating this Bill  will  be  an
exercise in futility, if its provisions are widely ignored.

Similarly, Mr Mokoena's  comments  in  respect  of  border  control  do  not
reflect the Bill as introduced or amended. He seemed  to  be  talking  about
the yesteryear Bill.

I do not know how to answer the hon Mr  Pretorius's  blaming  my  department
for the delay in placing the Bill before the committee. Obviously, he and  I
do not share the same reality. My recollection is that I brought  the  draft
Bill to the committee on or about  26  October  1999,  published  it  on  15
February 2000, invited the committee to a conference on  the  Bill  in  July
2000, posted it on the Internet, each and every  new  version  of  the  Bill
being discussed, tabled it in Parliament in April 2001, formally  introduced
it in the  Committee  in  August  2001,  and  instructed  three  of  my  top
officials to be available to the committee on a full-time basis. I note  his
opinion that this  Bill  has  been  improved  through  the  efforts  of  the
majority party, which I think speaks volumes in many respects. I can  assure
him that training in my department has already commenced, which I took  upon
myself to launch before my director-general did nothing about it.

I thank the hon Ms Van Wyk for her contribution in this debate, and for  the
many sharp contributions I understand  she  made  during  the  work  of  the
committee. However, I must take strong exception  to  her  stating  that  my
department rejected  all  suggested  amendments  as  ludicrous,  as  all  my
department's positions have been placed before  the  committee  in  writing,
and in documentation which I personally  reviewed,  the  word  ``ludicrous''
was utilised only on two occasions in a hundred pages. And for a  very  good
cause, the word ``ludicrous'' was used.

Her comments about the quota system  are  optimistic  and  do  not  seem  to
appreciate the complexity of this matter. But, I hope  that  she  will  give
her contribution to overcome them as we move forward.

I  thank  the  hon  Ms  Maunye  for  highlighting  the  complexity  of   the
multifaceted aspects of permits and their issuance. I can  assure  her  that
our legislation is up to  international  standards  in  respect  of  refugee
affairs, and I share her concerns that  great  work  needs  to  be  done  in
educating  our  people  on  the  difference  between  refugees  and  illegal
foreigners. I would like to tell her that in December I  attended  the  50th
anniversary of the signing of the Convention  on  Refugees  in  Geneva,  and
received compliments from many ministers of home affairs  from  other  parts
of the world for what I said there.

I further wish to  thank  the  hon  Mr  Swart,  and  I  appreciate  that  he
appreciates that the provisions  relating  to  homosexual  partnerships  are
constitutionally  mandated.  Similarly,  those  relating   to   heterosexual
relationships are constitutionally mandated as well, even though the  matter
did not directly come before the Constitutional Court.

In respect of the practical difficulty of dealing with this matter,  he  may
be aware that the system has already been in force for  two  years,  without
any major hiccups.

I also wish to thank the hon Mfundisi for the many insightful  contributions
he made during the committee's work  and  for  his  words  to  us  today.  I
understand his understanding of macroeconomic realities and  the  connection
between importing foreign human capital and our economic growth.

A word of thanks goes to the hon Rajbally, the hon Dominee  Aucamp  and  the
hon Kalako for their contributions. I only appeal to  the  hon  Kalako  that
the English expression of ``tearing the  Bill  to  pieces''  should  not  be
taken literally. We are speaking figuratively. [Laughter.]

Finally, I wish to thank the hundreds of people and the  institutions  which
over the years have made  innumerable  contributions  to  this  process  and
participated in this debate on migration control. It has  been  an  enormous
collegial effort which has involved  the  whole  of  our  country.  It  will
remain an example of how legislation should be brought to  Parliament,  with
the benefit  of  strong  debate  in  the  press  and  the  participation  of
stakeholders and role-players. The passage of this  Bill  has  been  a  true
exercise in democracy, in which each institution of Government and  building
block of our society has  played  an  unprecedented  and  significant  role,
unabridged by any concern or limit, as we all know.

Buthelezi-bashing is always allowed. Buthelezi is a hard-bitten  politician;
therefore people spoke their minds openly on this Bill.  Even  if  they  had
nothing to say, I tolerated them, for  that  is  what  democracy  is  about.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 28 - Labour:

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Madam Speaker, hon members, whenever we  behold  the
source of light  and  its  movement  from  the  eastern  escarpment  of  our
beautiful land, we know that we have been spared yet another day to rise  to
the challenge to serve our people. Whenever the incisive  rays  of  the  sun
make a breakthrough as they permeate the clouds of the skies,  we  are  also
reminded of the breakthrough that we are making in moving our  country  away
from its painful and shameful past to its glorious  and  prosperous  future.
As the light of the sun brightens our path, en route to a  better  life  for
all, we know that we shall neither stumble nor  fall,  as  we  are  able  to
clearly see the route on which we travel - as a people, as  a  country,  and
as  a  nation.  Indeed,  steadily  but  surely  our  country  is  making   a
breakthrough  in  removing   the   historical   barriers   responsible   for
constraining our economic growth.

Our beloved country has made, and  continues  to  make,  a  breakthrough  in
introducing measures aimed at promoting job creation, even  though  we  know
there  is  no  quick-fix  solution  to  the  challenges   of   poverty   and
unemployment that continue to plague our  country.  These  breakthroughs  we
are making in gradually pushing back the frontiers of poverty and  of  other
development in our country will not escape the attention of anyone  who  has
suffered the injustices and  atrocities  of  our  unenviable  and  invidious
past.

Only those whose power of judgment is irreparably  impaired  would  fail  to
observe the strides we  have  made,  the  efforts  we  have  taken  and  the
breakthrough that fellow South Africans  have  collectively  achieved  under
extremely  adverse  conditions  in  creating  an  enabling  environment  for
economic growth, increased labour market efficiency, fostering  high  levels
of productivity, promoting stable and sound labour relations, enhancing  the
development of skills, eliminating discrimination and  inequalities  in  the
labour market,  improving  working  conditions,  especially  for  vulnerable
workers, and improving our social safety net. In this regard I say,  without
equivocation,  that  our  country  has  made,  and  continues  to  make,   a
breakthrough.

However, key amongst our concerns is  the  problem  of  unemployment  which,
according to the latest labour force survey of Statistics SA, has  increased
by 2,9% to a total  of  4,5  million.  It  is  worth  noting  that  recently
analysed data shows that over the  period  1995  to  1999  total  employment
increased by 1,1 million jobs. But in  the  same  period  some  3,1  million
individuals entered the labour market. These  figures  show  that  over  the
last decade our marginal economic growth has not been  matched  by  adequate
employment creation.

This new challenge  that  our  economy  faces  is  being  addressed  in  the
economic cluster of Government  by  various  interventions.  Trends  in  the
labour market also highlight significant inequalities that prevail in  terms
of race and gender. For instance, 85,6% of the unemployed are Africans,  the
majority of whom are women, and 71,9% of the unemployed are aged between  15
and 34 years.

Of course, those who  are  ideologically  opposed  to  the  constitutionally
sanctioned rights of workers to decent labour  standards  will  continue  to
blame all the ills of our economy on the  labour  legislation.  This  is  in
spite of the  fact  that  last  year  this  House,  as  well  as  the  NCOP,
unanimously passed amendments to the Labour  Relations  Act  and  the  Basic
Conditions of Employment Act, following a protracted period of  negotiations
among social partners, all of whom agreed that the new changes  would  go  a
long way in addressing investors' concerns without creating  an  environment
in which the rights  of  workers  are  trampled  upon  with  impunity.  Most
stakeholders are agreed that, as a  deal,  the  new  laws  have  managed  to
strike  a  balance  between  labour  market  efficiency  and  decent  labour
standards.

One of the key challenges our labour market faces is that the global  forces
that influence it have reduced the demand for low-skilled workers,  of  whom
our country has an abundance, and increased the demand for skilled  workers,
of whom we have a  short  supply.  A  dire  consequence  of  these  changing
patterns of labour demands is that there is a significant group  of  people,
mostly  black,  mostly  women  and  mostly  youth,  who  are  fast  becoming
unemployable and will remain so unless some drastic interventions are  made.
They face long-term unemployment. This  is  the  challenge  that  our  human
resource development strategy and the skills development  strategy  seek  to
address.

The national skills development strategy that I launched last year seeks  to
develop a culture of life-long learning, foster skills  development  in  the
formal economy for productivity and economic growth, stimulate  and  support
skills  development  in  small  business,  promote  skills  development  for
employability  and  sustainable  livelihoods  through   social   development
initiatives, as well as assist young new entrants into employment.

While I am the very first to admit that this  programme  is  ambitious,  our
first year's results demonstrate that if we pull together  as  a  nation  we
can achieve the targets we set for ourselves. For instance, our  learnership
target for March 2002 was 3  000  learners.  By  27  March  we  had  already
exceeded the target by 6% and the numbers keep growing. At  the  last  count
we had more than doubled the number to a staggering figure of 7  480  people
enrolled in learnerships.  This  illustrious  and  magnificent  breakthrough
gives us confidence that the 80 000 mark we have set for the year 2005  will
indeed be met.

Overall, the 25 sectoral education and training authorities which  were  set
up nearly two years ago, are functioning well,  as  evidenced  by  the  fact
that already 87% of the funds under  their  custodianship  has  either  been
paid out or  allocated  to  firms  and  projects.  As  can  be  expected  of
institutions in their infancy, and governed by social partners,  some  Setas
have experienced teething  problems.  The  department  is  entering  into  a
memorandum of understanding  with  each  Seta  setting  out  sector-specific
targets that should be achieved during  the  year.  We  have  also  provided
dedicated  capacity  to  assist  Setas  to   address   their   institutional
challenges and achieve their objectives.

Three days ago, all members may know, I launched 18  strategic  projects  to
be funded out of the National Skills Fund. About R1,1 billion over a  three-
and-a-half year period has been allocated to these projects, which  seek  to
fund various skills development initiatives, linked to existing  or  planned
jobs or income-generating opportunities  aligned  to  Government's  national
employment and growth goals.

This is yet another breakthrough we have made with regard to developing  our
country's human resources and enhancing the capacity of our  enterprises  to
compete favourably in the world market. [Applause.]  We  have  also  made  a
laudable and splendid breakthrough in protecting the  rights  of  vulnerable
workers.  The  department  has  published,  for  public  comment,   proposed
sectoral  determinations  for  the  agricultural   and   domestic   sectors,
respectively. These will be gazetted once I  have  received  and  given  due
consideration to the final  recommendations  of  the  Employment  Conditions
Commission.

The ECC is also in the process of considering a sectoral  determination  for
the retail sector. A sectoral determination for the  security  industry  was
published  during  the  year,  amending  minimum  wages  and  conditions  of
employment in that sector. This  breakthrough  was  made  possible  due  the
flexibility inherent in our legislation, in terms of which  each  sector  of
our  economy  can  adopt  a  dispensation  best   suited   to   its   unique
circumstances.  Given   the   unfair   discrimination   that   people   with
disabilities are exposed to  when  seeking  employment,  and  even  when  in
employment, the department has published for comment a code of good  conduct
for disability.

This is  yet  another  breakthrough  aimed  at  ensuring  that  people  with
disabilities are accorded the  rights  promised  in  our  supreme  law,  the
Constitution of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa.  These  rights  are  also
enshrined in the Employment Equity Act administered by my department. On  23
August 2001 the Commission on Employment  Equity  also  launched  its  first
report, containing data on the extent to which employers  were  implementing
the employment equity in the workplace. Ironically, this  report  proves  in
no  uncertain  terms  how  the  apartheid-styled  social   engineering   has
succeeded in fulfilling the dreams of its  architects,  namely,  to  prevent
black people in general and black women in particular from entering  certain
occupational categories.

It is the intention of the Employment Equity Act to turn the  tide,  and  to
turn into a nightmare the dreams of those who sought to ensure that  African
people are  relegated  to  being  hewers  of  wood  and  drawers  of  water.
[Applause.]  The  Employment  Equity  Act  will  turn  this  dream  into   a
nightmare.  In  terms  of  our  Constitution,  we  as  South  Africans  have
committed  ourselves  to  preventing  unfair  discrimination  in  any  form,
against anyone, on any irrational grounds. We must  all  now  live  out  the
implications of our commitment at the workplace by ensuring that  we  remove
all barriers  that  continue  to  prevent  blacks,  women  and  people  with
disabilities from pursuing the occupational categories of their choice.

The phenomenal decrease in workplace accidents and fatalities  in  the  past
two years is another noteworthy  breakthrough.  In  the  year  2001,  5  950
workplace accidents were  recorded.  In  the  year  2002,  this  figure  was
reduced by about 46%. Similarly, the year-on-year  workplace  fatality  rate
reduced within a 12-month period by about 40%. While  we  believe  that  one
workplace  accident  or  fatality  is  one  too  many,  who  would   be   so
unreasonable as to deny that this drastic reduction in  workplace  accidents
and fatalities is a breakthrough  in  the  struggle  for  healthy  and  safe
working environments? Nevertheless, we  pledge  ourselves  to  continue  the
fight against workplaces that approximate war zones, where injury  or  death
is an inherent occupational hazard.

The breakthrough in the reduction of workplace accidents can  be  attributed
in part to the  partnership  that  the  department  has  entered  into  with
organised  business  and  labour,  aimed  at  promoting  healthy  and   safe
workplaces. On 8 April 2002 organised business,  Government  and  the  three
main labour  federations,  Cosatu,  Nactu  and  Fedusa,  signed  an  accord,
committing  themselves  to  contributing  their  respective   resources   to
preventing workplace illness, accidents and fatalities.

This is yet another breakthrough in ensuring that workers do not go to  work
to die. During the year under review, 5 469 inspections were carried out  at
workplaces. While the majority of workplaces inspected  showed  high  levels
of compliance, we were dismayed  to  find  that  there  were  still  certain
employers who continued to place profits ahead of human life.

However, the increased visibility of our inspectors has continued to  ensure
that recalcitrant employers find no place to hide. With the capacity of  our
inspectorate having been increased to a total of 1 335 posts  and  with  the
commitment  of  unions  to  ensuring  that  all   workplaces   have   safety
committees, a continued remarkable improvement in  the  occupational  health
and safety environment is anticipated.

During the previous financial year, my department's inspectors also  secured
the first ever prosecution and conviction  for  child  labour.  The  process
began when my department spearheaded the adoption of the  ILO  Child  Labour
Convention. Implementation of the convention  necessitated  the  development
of a child  labour  action  programme.  The  conviction  was  part  of  that
programme, and my department will continue to take steps  to  eliminate  the
exploitation of children at work.

However, our success rate will increase dramatically if courageous  whistle-
blowers continue to ensure that all offenders are reported. This  conviction
and sentence will undoubtedly send an unequivocal signal that employers  who
exploit the most vulnerable of our country's  most  precious  citizens,  its
children,  by  exposing  them  to  employment  practices  that  harm   their
development and deprive them of their education, shall not escape  the  full
might of the state.

Our success in this field of work has  received  international  recognition.
South Africa was asked to host one of only  six  international  launches  of
the recently published ILO global report entitled: ``A future without  child
labour''.

Another critical strategic objective of  the  department  is  to  contribute
towards  the  provision  of  a  social  safety  net  for  workers  who   are
temporarily  unemployed  -  those  who  get  injured  at  work  or  contract
occupational diseases. In order  to  effectively  discharge  our  obligation
with regard to the provision of the Unemployment  Insurance  Fund,  we  have
had to completely overhaul the entire policy framework.  This  has  resulted
in the repealing of the old Act and the passing  of  new  legislation  which
extends coverage to certain categories of workers hitherto excluded.

The new legislation, underpinned  by  new  administrative  efficiency,  also
aims to improve the liquidity and solvency of the fund,  thereby  making  it
self-sufficient. This is yet another breakthrough by  the  department  aimed
at strengthening our social safety net to benefit  those  who  need  it  the
most.

In response to the dissatisfaction expressed by claimants  regarding  delays
in the  processing  of  claims  by  the  compensation  commission,  we  have
introduced new procedures  backed  up  with  a  new  information  technology
system that aims  to  drastically  reduce  the  waiting  period  for  future
claims. This, to me, is yet another practical expression of  our  commitment
to Government's service charter captured in the dictum Batho Pele.

In  fact,  the  commitment  to  efficient  and  effective  service  delivery
permeates  the  entire  Department  of  Labour.  In  this  department,  good
performance  is  rewarded  while  bad  performance  is  sanctioned   through
punitive sanctions, preceded by  attempts  to  improve  the  performance  of
aberrant officials. Corruption and financial impropriety  invariably  result
in dismissal; of course, this only occurs  after  due  processes  have  been
followed.

As regards the development of the people  who  work  in  the  Department  of
Labour, we believe in leadership by  example.  Over  and  above  the  senior
management training programme, we expose our managers  to  Wits  University.
We have now secured an  agreement  with  Technikon  South  Africa  to  train
existing and aspirant inspectors.
We have also created  an  opportunity  for  those  who  want  to  acquire  a
tertiary qualification in their area of work to do so through  the  e-Degree
framework linked to the University of the Free State and Chicago.

The department  has  also  committed  itself  to  being  one  of  the  three
Government departments that are acting as pilot sites for the  investors-in-
people standard, alongside 37 private organisations.  This  is  yet  another
breakthrough aimed at ensuring that the department contributes  towards  the
development of its most valuable resource - its people.

The department leads by example in the advancement  of  persons  defined  in
the Employment Equity Act  as  designated  groups.  In  this  regard  it  is
heartening  to  note  that  the  demographic  profile  of  the   department,
including its leadership, is a microcosm of the demographic profile  of  the
country. That is yet  another  breakthrough  by  the  department,  aimed  at
giving practical expression to the  spirit  and  letter  of  the  Employment
Equity Act that seeks to deal a final blow to workplace discrimination.

Despite the breakthrough we  have  made  in  creating  the  dispensation  we
envisaged,  together  with  those  who  paid  the  ultimate  price  for  our
liberation, those whose mortal  remains  continue  to  decompose  under  the
belly of the earth, it is not our intention  to  rest  on  our  laurels  and
succumb to the complacency that often accompanies success and achievement.

Therefore, when the ball  of  fire  dips  its  head  below  the  hills,  the
mountains and the oceans, as it disappears below the  horizon  and  abandons
us to signal that the day's work is done; and when the light  of  day  grows
dim and succumbs to the fatigue that sets in after a day's  work,  we  shall
not stop doing our work until our optical muscles can no longer sustain  our
desire to defy the course of nature.

With deep reluctance, we shall accept the temporary conquest brought on  our
limbs and muscles as our bodies prostrate fall, only because  we  know  that
that is the only way our energy can be replenished in order for us to  carry
on with our struggle. And so, when our heads lie on a  pillow  pleading  for
some rest, the grey matter within it does not fully rest;  it  continues  to
think and dream of a society we all cherish and work so hard  to  create,  a
society that Douglas Gibson does not want to cherish ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  [Laughter]  ...
a society devoid of the indignity of  unemployment  and  of  the  burden  of
poverty and disease.

So, when the seasons of the year change,  as  they  must,  and  the  natural
source of heat succumbs  to  obstacles  that  prevent  it  from  rising  and
shining, to give the light, warmth and life to all who  need  it,  we  shall
not likewise succumb to obstacles that seek to prevent us  from  translating
the dreams and hopes of our people into reality. Nothing will deter us  from
ensuring that our country realises its full potential.

Adversity will only strengthen our resolve. Ill-conceived  criticism  sounds
to our ears no more than a noisy cymbal, not worthy  of  derailing  us  from
our noble goal. The steepness of the incline of  the  surface  on  which  we
march shall not discourage us  from  continuing,  even  if  the  hon  member
continues to shout close to  my  left  ear,  nor  will  the  length  of  the
distance, because we know where we are headed. In fact, the breakthrough  we
have made so far serves as  a  reminder  that  the  goal  we  have  set  for
ourselves is indeed achievable.

But we shall only celebrate our breakthrough when everyone who needs  a  job
either gets one or creates one. It is only when workplaces are a  haven  for
a sustainable peace and stability that we shall  celebrate.  We  shall  only
celebrate when workers are provided with the training they need  to  develop
their potential. When no employer sacrifices the lives  of  workers  on  the
altar of profit, then we shall celebrate.

We shall only celebrate when the productivity of our workforce enhances  our
country's world competitiveness, when no worker is discriminated against  on
the basis of  one  or  other  irrational  ground,  and  when  no  worker  is
dismissed without just cause and a fair procedure. [Applause.]

[When there is light we know that daytime has come, and that light gives  us
hope, power and encouragement to start a new day with eagerness to face  the
challenge of making this country's people's lives better.  The  Bible  says,
``Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall  tribulation  ...  or
persecution ...? [Interjections.] The Bible goes further to  say,  ``None''.
We all assert that there shall be no hurdles, mountains, hills or  any  kind
of barrier that would ever stop us from achieving the goals of  the  ANC-led
Government. Some refer to it as the bone of a snake that pricks the  one  it
hates. [Applause.]]

Until then, no ounce of energy will be spared and no sacrifice will  be  too
great with the support of my esteemed Director-General,  who  is  wearing  a
blue hard hat, and his competent team that is sitting around him;  with  the
commitment of the  Labour  portfolio  committee  and  the  style  they  have
adopted this year of visiting a whole range  of  areas,  even  some  of  the
departmental offices, and the co-operation of social partners all of whom  I
am indebted to for the breakthrough we have so far made.

I have no doubt in my mind that together we shall run  this  race,  that  we
shall complete the full distance and that we shall  reach  for  our  dreams.
[Applause.]

Mr  N  J  CLELLAND-STOKES:  Chairperson,  there  is  no  doubt  that  as   a
department,  Labour  has  accomplishments  worthy  of  congratulations   and
endorsement.

The Compensation Commissioner seems to be on track and has dealt  decisively
with its administrative backlogs. The Setas, although by  no  means  working
at  optimum  efficiency,  seem  to  have  turned  the  corner,  and  it   is
particularly gratifying to observe the recent allocation of a  billion  rand
from the National Skills Fund to 18 strategic projects,  including  domestic
workers, microfinance lenders and agricultural workers. Also, the  proactive
and blitz inspections of  workplaces  have  gone  a  long  way  towards  the
prevention   and   policing   of   unfair   labour   practices,   including,
particularly, child labour.

Where the Minister and his department deliver in the  interests  of  Africa,
the Democratic Alliance will give him the credit and  our  support,  but  we
are even-handed. As the official opposition, we are entrusted with the  duty
to hold the executive to account and we treat that responsibility  with  the
importance it deserves.

Faced with soaring labour costs, employers -  they  are  the  people  tasked
with creating jobs in this country - continue to cut their workforces.

Over 2 million jobs have vanished since 1994, and 7 million  South  Africans
today are unemployed. Almost half the number of  these  people  are  younger
than thirty, and almost 90% of them do not possess any  skills  or  training
for jobs. The hard fact is that unskilled  workers  have  become  so  costly
that everyone who is  in  the  job  creation  business  would  do  anything,
including instituting expensive mechanisation, to avoid hiring more people.

Last year, as the Minister said, we passed a series  of  amendments  to  the
Labour Relations Act and the Basic Conditions  of  Employment  Act.  The  DA
supports these amendments because they were a step in the  right  direction.
But I said then, and I will say it again, that they do not  go  far  enough.
Our labour law regime  needs  a  radical  and  revolutionary  overhaul,  not
cosmetic and peripheral tampering.

More than two years ago the skills  development  levy  was  introduced,  but
today far too many small and medium-size businesses are  not  claiming  from
the fund. The DA calls on businesses across the country to claim and  train,
I repeat, claim and train. To simply write off the skills  development  levy
as another  tax  is  morally  inexcusable  and  economically  suicidal.  The
Umsobomvu Fund was created in 1998, yielding a total  of  R855 million,  and
after five years, the amount now sits at a whopping R1 billion.

On many occasions the  hon  the  Minister  has  accused  the  opposition  of
criticising for the sake of criticism alone. This is not the policy  of  the
DA. Today I would like to make a concrete  proposal  that  will  change  the
lives of half a million South Africans  every  single  year.  We  propose  a
voucher system to give poor school-leavers access  to  training  or  further
education, and to provide them with guidance and start-up  costs  for  small
businesses. In terms of this proposal an opportunity voucher  to  the  value
of R3 000 should be given to 300 000 matriculants  and  a  further  200  000
young, unemployed people each year for five years.

The Umsobomvu Fund can fund this system. Recipients would be able  to  trade
the  opportunity  voucher  for  training   and   education   at   accredited
institutions, or for the purposes of starting  a  micro  enterprise,  or  in
exchange for wages from an accredited employer.  Recipients  will  therefore
be able to decide for themselves how to use the  vouchers,  thus  maximising
the effectiveness of the system and simplifying its administration.

The DA is committed to the challenge of  job  creation.  When  the  hon  the
Minister facilitates and encourages the creation of jobs, we will be  behind
him. But when he accomplishes the opposite, we  will  fight  him  tooth  and
nail, because that is our patriotic duty.

The Department  and  Ministry  of  Labour  have  many  important  roles  and
responsibilities, some of which they do perform. All of these, though,  pale
into insignificance when pitted against the  need  to  provide  an  economic
environment conducive to investment and job creation.

It is not  only  individual  pieces  of  legislation  which  are  themselves
grossly unreasonable or excessively horrific, but, taken together  with  the
relatively high cost of labour, low productivity and the underskilled  South
African workforce, they are proving to  be  a  crushing  and  insurmountable
barrier to job creators and wealth-makers. That is the Minister's  nettle  -
I challenge him to grasp it. [Applause.]

Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson,  eight  years  ago  the  democratic  Government,
through  the  Department  of  Labour,  inherited  a  fragmented  and  highly
distorted labour market. However, I am in agreement with  Comrade  Mdladlana
that, yes, indeed, there has been a  breakthrough.  The  ANC-led  Government
has  been  successful  in  delivering  on  our  promise  of  a  new   labour
dispensation that not only entrenches the precious workers'  rights,  denied
workers for so long, but also lays the foundation for sustainable and  sound
economic growth.

As I indicated during our  Budget  Vote  debate  last  year,  when  the  ANC
preaches about a better life for all,  this  also  includes  better  working
conditions for the workers of this country and job  creation  measures  that
cover a conducive atmosphere for the unemployed masses,  which  this  Budget
seeks to implement further. Indeed, industrial relations have never been  so
good.

Yes, it is a breakthrough. Today we are debating a  Budget  Vote  that  will
further change the lives of many people in different ways or styles.

Concern has been expressed in South Africa that employment estimates do  not
capture employment creation adequately, since employment  series  exclude  a
number of job creation sectors, and further that  official  statistics  give
excellent coverage of economic Setas that are expected  to  shed  jobs,  but
unfortunately give inadequate coverage of those sectors  that  are  expected
not to be creators of unemployment.

I would be very happy if Comrade Minister could share  some  light  on  this
crucial matter, because some commentators blame  Government  for  what  they
comfortably interpret to accommodate them. My belief is  that  this  ANC-led
Government has successfully transformed the labour market  of  this  country
and made it possible to create a conducive climate for job opportunities.

To my colleague, the hon Nick, I want to say that some people  do  not  have
skills today precisely  because  of  the  previous  government's  role  with
regard to the Bantu education system; it  is  not  because  of  the  ANC-led
Government. They also have to take responsibility for that.

With regard to institutional support,  it  is  interesting  and  encouraging
that  institutions  such  as  the  National  Productivity   Institute   have
developed creative and progressive turnaround structures to  save  jobs,  if
notified in time. I hope this Budget Vote in particular will give a  greater
allocation to this institution, because they really try their level best  to
assist and contribute positively to our economy.

Coming to the Council for  Conciliation,  Mediation  and  Arbitration,  this
institution is geared to work better and, indeed, best, as reflected in  the
preliminary annual report for  2001-02  distributed  yesterday.  The  report
states that the CCMA improved its settlement rate for  conciliation  to  73%
of cases heard. Between April and September 2001 the  daily  average  number
of referrals was 47. A total of 67% of cases  were  conciliated  within  the
statutory timeframes. There were, on average, 1 212 arbitrations per day.
Yes, indeed, this is a historical breakthrough for this institution to  have
performed this way. When it was established, many commentators thought  that
it was a waste of  time  and  money.  But  today,  when  some  of  them  are
reminded, their reply is ``no comment''.

The National Economic Development and Labour Council was  launched  in  1995
as a central vehicle for dialogue on social and economic policy between  the
then newly elected Government and  major  organised  constituencies  in  the
country. As stated in the  1995-96  report,  Nedlac  was  designed  to  take
account of the new role for social dialogue  in  fundamentally  transforming
the country.

In a historic  statement  of  co-operation,  Nedlac's  founding  declaration
committed Government, business and labour to jointly  pursue  the  goals  of
growth, equity and participation. All in all, the work done by  Nedlac  from
that time until today has been tremendous. Dispute resolution  has  improved
a great deal and is continuing to do so.  Is  it  not  a  breakthrough  that
Government, business, labour  and  community  representatives  can  sit  and
negotiate in good faith to improve the lives of our people? Yes, indeed,  it
is a breakthrough and should not be tampered with for many years to come.

With regard to the Compensation Commission, from 22 to 24 April  this  year,
the portfolio committee did oversight work and undertook a trip to  Pretoria
to visit the NPI, the UIF and the Compensation Commission. I must  say  that
the NPI and the Compensation Commission  were  the  best,  but,  as  members
know, we have passed legislation to change the way the UIF operates. It  was
ready for us to make observations that would make us believe that there  had
been a drastic change. However, I am sure we will  be  able  to  visit  them
next time, but only if our committee allocation  is  improved,  because  the
committees operate on a very slim budget.

We were quite  impressed  by  the  level  of  efficiency  displayed  by  the
Compensation Commission. We were really happy when  we  saw  the  manner  in
which they worked.

We hope that the commissioner who is present here  today,  Mrs  Magojo,  and
her team will work even harder than we have already  witnessed.  I  am  sure
that clients are very happy to be assisted with a smile, something which  in
a way promotes the Batho Pele concept and which is a positive  thing  to  do
generally. Therefore we hope that they will work even better  so  that  when
we go there next time they will have improved even more.

The music that they rendered for the portfolio committee was  very  good.  I
did not know that we had singers in the portfolio committee, but we do,  and
they joined them and did very well. We hope that  next  time  they  will  do
even better than they did the last time.

In my concluding remarks I would like to tell the hon the Minister that  the
Department of Labour is still the best in terms  of  service  delivery.  But
there are still challenges facing every stakeholder. Child labour  is  still
a major problem in our country, but I hope that with this year's  budget  we
will be able to make a difference towards totally eradicating this problem.

Moreover, there are still emlpoyers who do not implement the labour laws  we
have  adopted.  Therefore  the  question  of  enforcement  is  of   critical
importance.

Perhaps the number of inspectors will be increased, and  we  will  also  try
and make  sure  that  they  get  the  necessary  co-operation.  When  we  do
oversight work we will also work together with them in terms  of  trying  to
check the health and safety conditions of workers.

The other point I would like to raise is the question of  the  imbizos.  The
Minister has a programme of calling  imbizos  in  different  places  in  the
country. On 5 April the department invited those of us  who  were  available
during the constituency period to go and join it at Springs,  which  happens
to be my constituency. Indeed it was a very good  invitation,  and  we  were
happy to be part of that particular inspection at  one  company  in  Springs
and to participate in the imbizo that was called as well.

I must say that as much as people think that people are so bitter  in  terms
of the  Department  of  Labour's  role,  some  people  appreciate  the  good
measures which have been put in place by this department. And, yes, most  of
the people who participated raised concerns  regarding  unemployment  and  a
lot of other issues, but most of them were very eager that these imbizos  be
held more frequently, say twice per annum  per  area,  because  they  really
enjoyed being part of that discussion.

That means that the Government is really coming down to the  people.  It  is
now the people's Government because never before  would  a  Minister  simply
leave the office and go to  the  people  and  talk  to  them  about  general
issues. Therefore they wished that these imbizos could continue on a  larger
scale, so that they could get the opportunity  of  having  that  interaction
with the department's officials as the DG, the Minister  and  other  members
were part of the delegation. It was quite a good experience  for  us  to  at
least be able to understand what people's problems were.

Regarding the question of skills development, my colleagues will  contribute
more on the issues because they have  much  more  information  in  terms  of
that. I agree with the hon Clelland-Stokes  that  where  the  Government  is
doing okay, they should give it their support. But  in  terms  of  an  even-
handed approach, I am not sure whether they are in a position  to  do  that,
because they represent a certain sector within the communities. Therefore  I
am not sure to what percentage point they will be even-handed.  Will  it  be
50% or 90%? I do not know. They are the ones who know that,  and  they  also
know their own level of patriotism. We will see about that as time goes by.

The question of unemployment is a problem for every stakeholder - it is  not
solely the Government's problem. But with  the  labour  laws  that  we  have
passed over the years we have made the  atmosphere  or  the  situation  much
better and therefore easier to invest in.

Labour relations have drastically improved.  The  number  of  industrial  or
wildcat strikes that we used to have years ago has  decreased,  because  now
we have procedures that we have to follow before embarking on  such  action.
I am glad that unions and  management  -  some  of  them  -  do  follow  the
procedures, and therefore the strikes that we do get  are  controlled  in  a
better way.

That is part and parcel of their rights,  and  it  is  not  a  mistake  that
people can go on strike anyway. But  if  there  is  a  strike,  people  just
scream and think that this is a wrong thing to do. There  is  nothing  wrong
with that particular issue. It is part of one's constitutional rights.

Lastly, I would like to thank the members of the committee - as  the  acting
chair  now  -  because  they  co-operated  quite  well  with  me.  Even  the
opposition parties were really co-operative. We work together as a team  and
we hope that spirit will go on until the chairperson is back.  I  also  wish
him a speedy recovery from his illness.

But then, coming to the issue of some of the members who will be  delivering
their Budget Vote speech here, I am very surprised,  because  most  of  them
are like spiritual members. I know and I understand  that  they  have  other
committees to go to and that maybe some parties have only one member, but  I
have never seen all of them participating in some aspect of the  committees'
work, either budgetary work or whatever else.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  member,  your  time  has
expired.

Ms E THABETHE: I hope that we will hear their spiritual input  here  and  it
will be in a positive way. I also wish to thank the department. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I see the hon N C Middleton  of
the IFP.

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues,  Let  me  start  by
telling you, Mr Chairperson, that I am not N C, but N S,  for  No  Nonsense.
[Laughter.]

I am today reminded of what the great slave leader wrote, and I quote:


  Although slavery was abolished, the wrongs of my people were  not  ended.
  Though they were no longer slaves, they were not yet quite free.  No  man
  can be free and no man can be truly free, whose liberty is dependent upon
  the thought, upon the feeling and upon the actions of others and who  has
  himself no means in his own hands for guarding, protecting, defending and
  maintaining that freedom.

One of the greatest challenges facing our Government today is  that  of  job
creation. It is facing every one of us. Let us face the facts.  Unemployment
daily affects the lives of millions of our South Africans, especially  those
living in rural areas. Joblessness and poverty still  remain  a  threatening
factor in the lives of South African workers. The Department  of  Labour  is
therefore in duty bound to do more  than  it  is  currently  doing  for  the
reduction of unemployment, poverty and inequality in our  country.  Yet  the
department must be  commended  for  its  contribution  in  addressing  these
challenges by the formulation of labour market  policies  and  providing  an
environment for creating jobs.

The level of unemployment in this country is increasing on a  yearly  basis.
This is in spite of the wonderful policies and the Acts  which  we  pass  in
this  Parliament.  According  to  the  latest  statistics,  South   Africa's
official unemployment rate has increased by 3,1% over the past  six  months.
We have approximately 9,4 million  people  within  the  economically  active
population who are unemployed, and the figures are increasing daily.  People
who are mainly affected are those  in  the  rural  areas.  Statistics  again
further show that the mining and  the  agricultural  sectors  are  the  most
affected by job losses.

The sad part of the story is that although  the  department  has  formulated
wonderful policies, in practice very little has  been  done  to  combat  the
real problems of job losses. This  has  resulted  in  many  people  who  are
looking for jobs giving up the will to look for  employment,  thus  dividing
our country, not according to race but according to those who  are  employed
and those who are unemployed, those who have and those who have not.

The IFP also commends the department for its efforts to provide an  adequate
social safety net to  mitigate  the  impact  of  hardships  on  millions  of
economically vulnerable South Africans by improving  the  operation  of  the
Unemployment Insurance Fund and the collection of its revenue.  It  is  also
encouraging to note that according to the new legislation on  UIF,  a  large
number of employees who were previously excluded  from  the  fund  have  now
been included. However, the question of the  inclusion  of  public  servants
remains unresolved.

It is also encouraging to see that the  service  delivery  programme,  which
aims to implement and enforce various labour laws and to provide a  one-stop
service  through  business  units  in  the  departments,   particularly   in
provincial offices, has been allocated the sum of  R303,9  million  for  the
years 2001  to  2003.  It  is  hoped  that  through  these  programmes,  the
challenges facing this department of implementation of its policies will  be
adequately addressed.

Our country has been a  member  of  the  International  Labour  Organisation
since 1994, and it is now also a member of its  governing  body.  Since  our
acceptance to the ILO, we have been faced with the  task  of  ratifying  our
core labour standards, one of which is the elimination of child labour.

However, it is disturbing to note that about 44% of South  African  children
under the age of 17 years are working to earn a living.  While  some  do  so
voluntarily, for others it is the only way to put  food  on  the  table  for
them and their families.

The amount of child labour that is being used in  the  agricultural  sectors
is indeed disturbing. What is more disturbing is that 50% of these  children
do not even attend school.  Although  this  department  is  monitoring  this
situation, such incidents of child labour continue every day.  To  the  best
of my knowledge, only one case, that of the Van  Wyk  child  in  Ceres,  has
been brought to book. I wonder if this would have been done had  this  child
not lost her leg. How many of these cases are there still in our country?

Much as we appreciate the department's endeavours  to  address  the  various
challenges facing our people, we still maintain that a lot needs to be  done
in this regard.

In supporting the Budget Vote, we all have  a  challenge  today.  More  than
ever before, to help get rid of poverty and  suffering  in  our  nation,  we
must all join in the struggle for  the  future  prosperity  of  our  beloved
country, lest we all perish as fools. The  IFP  thus  supports  this  Budget
Vote. [Applause.]

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Chairperson, hon Minister Mdladlana,  hon  members,  ladies
and gentlemen, allow me to address you on this budget debate.

On behalf of the ANC, I support this budget. I support it because  it  is  a
budget directed at improving the lives of the people of this country. It  is
a budget allocated to  address  the  imbalances  of  the  past,  created  by
colonial and apartheid rule.

It is very encouraging to hear that a  department  in  these  testing  times
could prudently spend towards improved service delivery with a  variance  of
less than 5% of its budget. It is also unusual, after  being  faced  by  the
transformation challenges, that a department could  manage  a  roll-over  of
less than 1%.

This reflects directly on the capacity and political will  of  the  Minister
of Labour and his team. This proficiency reflects  on  the  political  party
that is leading this Government, and it is none other than the ANC.

When the ANC was voted into power in 1994, it made a pledge to  the  working
class of this country that it would  change  the  policies  that  undermined
fundamental rights. It would also transform institutions that were  used  to
exploit and dehumanise  the  workers  of  this  country.  It  stuck  to  the
fundamental principles contained  in  its  founding  document,  the  Freedom
Charter, and these principles were later enshrined in  the  Constitution  as
well as the RDP.

I say this because we need to know the subject, which is  service  delivery,
that I am going to speak on. The terrain is the distorted labour market,  as
mentioned earlier, and the players are the workers of this country, as  well
as the motivated staff of the Department of Labour and the mandated  members
of this Parliament.

It was first necessary for the Department of  Labour  to  give  priority  to
service delivery that would  improve  the  lives  of  the  workers  of  this
country, and to transform the  workplace,  which  would  make  this  country
globally competitive. It is for this reason that the  Department  of  Labour
adopted the Service Delivery  Charter  that  is  in  line  with  Batho  Pele
principles. These principles instil  a  culture  of  people-centred  service
delivery. It also addresses the question of transparency  and  the  people's
right to be informed on what the Government is doing to better their lives.

This Service Delivery Charter entrenches  professionalism  and  courtesy  in
public service employees. It also conforms to international  best  practices
and courtesy. It is only when the staff is capacitated  and  the  department
has capacity that our dreams can be realised. It  will  be  realised  if  we
move the frontiers of poverty and degradation.

The Department of Labour, through its transformation process, has  retrained
its staff and prepared them for ``one-stop-shop'' service delivery.  It  has
decentralised its services to provincial offices and labour centres.  Labour
centres have been converted into centres of excellence. Excellence can  only
be realised when service delivery is addressing the needs of beneficiaries.

I must emphasise the fact that the policy formulation process  is  complete.
The year 2002 has  been  declared  the  year  of  service  delivery  by  the
Department of Labour and the year of monitoring by the  Portfolio  Committee
on Labour. To achieve this, the Department of Labour, through its  Ministry,
has restructured the department into five business  units  that  have  their
own directorates.

These business units are as follows:  Management  support  services  provide
management of the provincial offices and labour  centres  through  planning,
organising, giving leadership  and  control.  Beneficiary  services  provide
services to unemployed workers and those  workers  injured  on  duty,  in  a
manner that conforms to relevant legislation. We give them credit for  their
efficient administration, processing  and  finalising  of  applications  for
payment.
Employment services  facilitate,  through  our  labour  centres,  access  to
employment and income-generating opportunities  for  the  underemployed  and
unemployed workers. We therefore call on  all  unemployed  workers  of  this
country to go to the nearest labour centres. Those who have  not  registered
should register and be exposed to all the good  things  that  these  centres
have to offer. They also render guidance  and  training  to  the  unemployed
youth, the disabled, women and the rural poor.

Inspection and enforcement services play a  key  role  with  regard  to  the
enforcement of the laws that we pass as  this  Parliament.  To  build  their
capacity, the department has exposed  the  staff  to  an  18-month  training
course in labour law  and  improved  their  conditions  of  employment.  For
instance, a problem existed in regard to transport and communication,  which
has been addressed.

The  labour  market  information   and   statistics   directorate   monitors
developments  in  the  labour  market  through  analysing  the   impact   of
legislation and the performance of job creation  programmes.  For  instance,
we had a situation in which we worked with the Western  Cape  labour  centre
and the provincial office.
The department has started a process  of  implementing  the  above-mentioned
programmes, together with organised labour and organised  employers.  Labour
inspectors are currently undergoing training at Technikon  South  Africa  on
certain standards. The procedure of inspections has also  changed,  so  that
an inspection is not be finalised unless the results have been  conveyed  to
workers. This will make workers aware of their rights  and  how  to  enforce
these.

It is therefore important that we note how  service  delivery  enhances  the
aims  and  objectives  of  our  Government  through,  amongst  others,   the
collection of UIF contributions from smaller  employers;  the  placement  of
workers; identifying opportunities for the self-employed; the  administering
of  leadership  programmes  -  this  will  be  elaborated  on  later  by  my
colleagues; enforcement of occupational  health  and  safety  standards,  as
mentioned   earlier;   and   enforcing   and   advocating    new    sectoral
determinations, also with reference to  farmworkers,  domestic  workers  and
the retail sector.

Allow me to commend the Portfolio Committee on Labour on the  role  that  it
has played in the execution of its  constituency  work.  This  was  achieved
through provincial visits aimed at monitoring compliance and support of  the
Department of Labour. Some problems that were identified  by  the  portfolio
committee and the  Department  of  Labour  during  these  provincial  visits
include the following: a high level of resistance by  employers  to  enforce
labour laws, especially on some farms and in ununionised industries;  a  low
level of partnership at labour centres where  Nedlac  stakeholders  are  not
playing their part enough; a low level of  partnership  in  some  localities
between the Department of  Labour,  other  relevant  departments  and  local
business; a high level of underutilisation of the social  clause  provisions
to avert retrenchments, more especially at  phase  one  which  comes  before
retrenchments - it does not help to take the  corpse  to  the  doctor  after
death; and a low level  of  access  to  information  by  unemployed  workers
relating to the services provided by the Department of Labour.

We therefore commend the Minister of  Labour  and  his  team,  as  mentioned
earlier. I am impressed by his  management  style  of  the  carrot  and  the
stick. He has managed, through performance achievement awards,  to  motivate
his staff. But, on the other hand, as we in the ANC would know, he does  not
condone corruption. He maintains discipline which leads to the dismissal  of
corrupt officials. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Mr J DURAND: Mr Minister, hon members,  the  New  NP  supports  this  Budget
Vote. We would like to congratulate the Minister of  Labour  on  how  he  is
dealing with the very difficult challenges facing him at this  moment.  Part
of the aim of the Department of Labour is to  play  a  significant  role  in
reducing  unemployment,  poverty  and  inequality   through   policies   and
programmes. I want to deal, in my contribution on  this  Budget  Vote,  with
the job crisis in  our  country.  Unemployment  is  one  of  South  Africa's
biggest problems and the reality  that  more  than  45%  of  this  country's
citizens are faced with.

The 2001 statistics show that the biggest world divide is not between  white
and black, which stands at 4 to  one,  but  between  the  employed  and  the
unemployed. The reason for these high numbers is not the lie  that  is  told
that this country has lazy workers. In truth the cost of labour is  dropping
while productivity is rising. South Africa's labour productivity  has  risen
this past decade by 4,4%. Our workers are among the most  adaptable  in  the
world, while things in Eastern Europe and Asia do not look so good. The  old
lie that South Africa  is  expensive  and  unproductive  is  smothering  the
country's growth and keeping investors away.

Employment creation is the biggest challenge facing this Government and  the
key instrument for fighting poverty. Giving a person a  fish,  or  R110  per
month for food, will not do it. If we  want  to  fight  poverty  and  ensure
economic growth we need to educate and train more skilled  workers,  because
while joblessness is on the rise, the most noticeable change in  the  labour
market conditions is an increasing demand for  skilled  workers.  Wages  for
unskilled workers have not increased.  Our  aspirations  must  not  stop  at
basic education. It is  a  crucial  investment  for  a  successful  economy.
Skills development is one of the Department of Labour's  key  objective  for
the period from 2002 to 2004.

A national skills development strategy was adopted in February  2001,  which
aims to meet the following key objectives in the near future: to  develop  a
culture of quality lifelong learning; to foster skills  development  in  the
formal economy for productivity and  employment  growth;  to  stimulate  and
support skills development in small business; to promote skills  development
for employability and a sustainable livelihood; to assist  new  entrants  to
the labour market. The Department of Labour will focus on these  objectives,
working in close partnership with Seta, the sector  education  and  training
authorities, and provincial stakeholders.

If the unemployed are to remain unemployable, then South Africa  is  heading
for serious economic problems. Every formally employed individual pays  over
1% of his salary to the skills development fund for the express  purpose  of
training and developing the unemployable. Why do we not use  this  money  to
develop skills training to the unemployed? Granted that the  private  sector
is becoming more capital-intensive, what  is  Government  doing  about  this
blatant oversupply of labour? In a developing country such as South  Africa,
Governments  can  surely  investigate  the  possibility  of  using   labour-
intensive methods before embarking on any state-driven projects.

The productive use of these funds  may  well  see  the  unemployable  become
employable, and, depending on the method of production,  they  may  even  be
able to find employment.

In Wednesday's Business Day we received the good news  that  18  Setas  have
collectively been awarded a  R1,2  billion  in  grants,  with  the  domestic
service training authority receiving R120 million. The grants come from  the
National Skills Fund and will be used to train about  350  000  people  over
the next three years in development projects identified and approved by  the
Labour department.

While this generation of workers will be the first to benefit, it will  also
provide training to many others thereafter.  The  National  Skills  Fund  is
administered by the Labour  department  and  funded  from  the  skills  levy
collected in accordance with the Skills  Development  Levies  Act  of  1999.
Given the current level of unemployment and the  continuing  loss  of  jobs,
this infusion of money could make a  huge  contribution  to  developing  the
skills employers are looking for and thus creating more jobs.

Suid-Afrika moet polities en ekonomies verantwoordbaar word, en sodoende  'n
klimaat skep waardeur buitelandse kapitaal hierheen gelok kan  word.  Indien
ons dit kan bewerkstellig, sal nywerheidslande ons groter  toegang  tot  hul
markte gee, ons skuldlas verklein, of selfs uitwis, en 'n groter  vloei  van
hulp waarborg. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[South Africa must become  politically  and  economically  accountable,  and
thereby create a climate in which foreign capital can be lured here.  If  we
can manage this, industrial countries will allow  greater  access  to  their
markets, they will reduce  our  debts,  or  even  eliminate  the  debt,  and
guarantee a greater flow of assistance.]

This is also one of the key objectives of Nepad and will not only build  our
infrastructure but will also help with the development  of  the  health  and
education system that South Africa and our continent need so badly.

Because of the high unemployment rate, the crime rate is  increasing  daily.
When people are unemployed they have the option  of  starving  or  stealing.
Crime and corruption are crippling our society and only  contribute  to  the
bad impression that investors have of our country.

There are several ways to fight poverty. The paradox of  our  time  is  that
more people have lifted themselves out of poverty in the last 50 years  than
in the previous 500 years. But, because the world population  has  grown  so
significantly, there are more poor people than ever before.

'n Paar maatreëls wat 'n groot impak kan maak op ons ekonomie en armoede  in
die algemeen is onder meer aanpassingsmaatreëls vir  werkers  soos  met  die
vermindering  van  belasting;   die   aanmoediging   van   'n   werkkultuur;
aansporingsmaatreëls vir ondernemings  om  van  arbeid  eerder  as  kapitaal
gebruik te maak; aansporingsmaatreëls vir ondernemings om plaaslik te  belê;
groter klem op die informele en  formele  kleinsakesektor;  die  versnelling
van die herstrukturering van staatsbates; doeltreffende  dienslewering  deur
al die vlakke van regering en die private sektor;  strenger  polisiëring  om
misdaadvlakke   af   te   bring   en   korrupsie   uit    te    roei;    die
institusionalisering  van  grondeienaarskap,  ook  onder  die   beheer   van
tradisionele leiers,  sodat  lae-inkomstegroepe  'n  mark  in  die  koop  en
verkoop van laekostebehuising kan skep,  en  die  inwerkingstelling  van  'n
beleid wat deur  die  wêreld  as  suksesvol  beskou  word.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[A few measures that could have a great impact on our  economy  and  poverty
in general are, inter alia, measures of adaptability  for  workers  such  as
the reduction of tax; the encouragement of a working  culture;  measures  of
encouragement for businesses  to  rather  use  labour  instead  of  capital;
measures of encouragement for businesses to invest  locally;  greater  focus
on the informal and formal small business sector; the  acceleration  of  the
restructuring of state assets; effective service delivery by all  levels  of
government and the private sector; stricter policing to reduce crime  levels
and to eradicate  corruption;  the  institutionalisation  of  landownership,
also under the control of traditional  leaders,  in  order  for  low  income
groups to create a market in the buying and  selling  of  low-cost  housing,
and the implementation of  a  policy  that  will  be  viewed  as  successful
throughout the world.]

Parliament has also passed a few very important Bills during  the  past  few
months.  The  Insolvency  Amendment  Bill,  which  was  submitted   by   the
Department of Justice, aims, amongst other things, to afford  employees  the
right to statutory severance pay in the  event  that  a  company  should  go
insolvent. The draft legislation is closely related to the Basic  Conditions
of Employment Amendment Bill and the Labour Relations Amendment Bill,  which
were  both  approved  earlier  this  year.  These  Bills  will  improve  the
efficiency of the labour market. The imperatives behind the amendments  are:
creating employment,  improving  labour  market  efficiency,  promoting  and
developing small business, improving the protection  of  vulnerable  workers
and addressing investors' negative perceptions.

I would also like to wish the  chairperson  of  our  committee  well  and  a
speedy recovery, and congratulate our acting chair on the wonderful  way  in
which she has led this committee.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We  all  join  in  wishing  the
chair a speedy recovery. Hon M J G Mzondeki will speak from his chair.

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, two  weeks  ago
I went to a hospital in Wynberg to get my assisting  devices.  While  I  was
there I had  a  discussion  with  one  of  the  doctors  who  treats  spinal
injuries. He shared with me  some  of  his  frustrations  with  compensation
claims. He said some of them take up to five years.

He said that his biggest concern was that  he  sometimes  had  to  discharge
patients, mostly paraplegics and tetraplegics,  without  assisting  devices,
and most of  these  people  used  wheelchairs.  He  said  that  because  his
patients were discharged without such devices, in no time they  landed  back
in hospital, mostly with pressure sores.

He says most of his patients are from Guguletu  and  Khayelitsha  townships.
They are patients who cannot afford to buy themselves wheelchairs and  other
assisting devices until they have received  their  compensation  claims.  He
sometimes has to loan them, but very limited resources do not allow  him  to
assist all patients. He wanted to know what  I  could  do  as  a  member  of
Parliament.

I must tell the hon the Minister that had I not coincidentally been  to  the
Compensations Commission office in Pretoria the previous week, I would  have
only added to his frustrations.

After the portfolio committee had visited the Compensation Fund  offices  in
Pretoria, we had a better understanding of why compensation claims  take  so
long  and  why  sometimes  there  are  not  even  responses  to   telephonic
enquiries. For decades these claims had been done manually - a very  tedious
and painstaking process. We were very glad to observe that  the  process  is
now being changed to an electronic system. This will  improve  the  work  of
that office and reduce the waiting period.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members  in  the  aisles,
please take your seats.

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Claims will now be processed  electronically,  even  from
the provincial offices. Queries will be  attended  to  at  the  press  of  a
button on the computer. The impact of this improvement is  huge,  especially
to those families who rely on the  pensions  of  such  workers.  This  is  a
breakthrough. The doctor at Wynberg cannot wait  to  hear  when  the  system
will be fully operational, and this is money well spent.

Among other things that  the  Department  of  Labour  is  committed  to,  is
bettering the skills and education of all  in  order  to  harness  the  full
potential of the human capital of our  country.  It  is  also  committed  to
eliminating inequalities in the workplace. The Employment Equity  Act  is  a
framework for the elimination of such discrimination in  the  workplace.  It
provides for the transformation of  the  workplace  to  ensure  that  it  is
accessible to all.

In August 2001 the Minister launched the Employment Equity  Report  and  the
Employment Equity Registry. The report reflects that  while  some  companies
are doing their best to comply with the  requirements  of  the  Act,  others
still have a lot to do. Many are still far below  the  targets  for  blacks,
women and people with disabilities. The Department of  Labour  is  committed
to assisting employers to comply. We are aware that the Act on its own  will
not assist to redress the situation at the workplace; hence  the  Employment
Equity Act and the Labour Relations Act provide that codes of good  practice
be put in place to give effect to the Act.

As the Minister was saying this morning, last year he  published  the  draft
code of practice on disability. This code seeks  to  give  a  definition  of
disability and guidelines to manage disabilities in the workplace.  Some  of
us will note that the figures indicate that 99% of disabled  jobseekers  are
out of work or unemployed. Some of the aspects that are dealt  with  in  the
code  are   reasonable   accommodation,   elimination   of   discrimination,
employment benefits and the definition of disability.

It is important to understand why such aspects have to  be  dealt  with.  At
one of the portfolio committees on which I serve,  a  Government  department
official was making a presentation and we wanted to know how  many  disabled
people were employed in  that  department.  Hesitantly  she  said  that  she
thought there was one person. We wanted to know what was the nature  of  the
disability and she said that he was a short person.  I  am  sure  that  this
code will assist us to define disability much better.

We believe that this code will go a  long  way  to  assist  jobseekers  with
disabilities to access jobs and  also  to  assist  employers  to  reach  the
target. People with disabilities do not enjoy living on  disability  grants.
They want to contribute to the economy of this country by earning  salaries.
I read somewhere that 99% of jobseekers are  people  who  have  disabilities
and who are not employed. If we can reliably use this figure,  a  lot  still
needs to be done.

We also welcome the fact that disabled  people  were  directly  involved  in
drafting this code. This will go a long way in giving a sense  of  ownership
and will assist to restore the dignity of people with disabilities.  We  are
also delighted that some of the Setas are beginning to involve  people  with
disabilities to participate in the process. However, we  believe  that  much
still needs to be done.

The report that I talked about also reflects that women currently  hold  13%
of all top management positions in  South  Africa  and  20%  of  all  senior
management  positions,  those  being   positions   immediately   below   top
management positions. African women hold only 1,2%  of  all  top  management
positions. This cannot be correct. Black  employees  represent  13%  of  all
employees in top management positions in South Africa. This  indicates  that
employers do not only have to report but also need to implement the Act.

In their concluding remarks on the report the commission has this to say:


  However, while it is true that many  have  responded  positively  to  the
  general challenge of complying  with  the  law,  the  reports  and  other
  sources of empirical data suggest that there are, at this stage,  varying
  degrees of understanding of the extent of the legal  obligations  arising
  under the Act and commitment to implementing the spirit and not just  the
  letter of the law.
This is particularly evident  in  the  section  of  the  employment  reports
dealing with qualitative issues  and  interventions  on  employment  equity.
They further say in their remarks:


  The organisations which seem to  make  visible  progress  in  attracting,
  developing, advancing and retaining  suitably  qualified  persons,  black
  people, women and people with  disabilities,  the  designated  groups  in
  terms of the Act, were those who saw  affirmative  action  in  favour  of
  those groups as one of their key strategies for pursuing corporate  goals
  such as achieving and maintaining  productivity,  excellence  and  global
  competitiveness. These are employers who saw employment equity more as  a
  business imperative rather than simply an issue  of  complying  with  the
  law. In many of these companies accelerated human resource development is
  a critical part of their affirmative action measures.

[Chairperson, our committee visited Tshwane three weeks ago, where we had  a
meeting with the National Productivity Institute. We asked them  to  explain
to  us  the  manner  in  which  their  organisation   is   operating.   This
organisation is patronised financially by the department, and  that  is  the
main reason why we paid  them  a  visit.  This  organisation  is  playing  a
pivotal role in preventing job losses. We should know that phase  1  of  the
social plan belongs to them, a process whereby we try to prevent job  losses
before they occur. Among their tasks I can single out their  involvement  in
encouraging the development of disabled entrepreneurs. This they do  in  co-
operation with other departments. Hon Minister,  we  really  appreciate  and
encourage them in their task.]

Let me conclude by saying that people with disabilities welcome the  Letsema
and Vukuzenzele call by our  President.  We  believe  that  this  will  give
people  with  disabilities  an  opportunity  to  display  their  skills  and
potential. It will also help restore their dignity as, for  a  change,  they
will do things for others and not the other way  round,  as  mostly  is  the
case or as it is sometimes perceived to be.

We believe that this is an opportunity for business  to  heed  the  call  by
lending a hand, building  ramps  and  lifts  at  schools  and  other  public
buildings. Disabled people will gladly volunteer to draw  an  audit  of  all
inaccessible public buildings.

The ANC supports the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Mohlomphegi Modulasetulo, mokgatlo wa UDM o  thekga  polelo
ya mohlomphegi Tona. [Chairperson, the UDM agrees  with  what  the  Minister
has said.]

The 15-point programme of the Ministry of Labour aims, inter alia,  to  give
attention to certain areas for possible legislative amendments,  to  improve
the effective functioning of the labour market and to  reduce  what  may  be
perceived to be obstacles to employment creation. We all regret, of  course,
that there has been an  increase  of  3,9%  in  the  already  high  rate  of
unemployment. We also agree  that  this  is  the  biggest  challenge  facing
Government.

It is gratifying to  note  that  the  relationship  between  Government  and
labour has now improved tremendously, through dialogue  and  the  Minister's
pragmatic approach in dealing with labour problems, as  highlighted  by  the
signing of an accord by Government, Cosatu and Nactu.

It is therefore no exaggeration to  say  that  evidence  suggests  that  the
interventions introduced through the Labour Relations Act, 1995,  the  Basic
Conditions of Employment Act, 1997, and the  Employment  Equity  Act,  1998,
and subsequent amendments have contributed positively to  the  promotion  of
stable labour relations and economic growth in our country.

While  we  appreciate  the  reduction  of  the  rate  of  accidents  at  the
workplace, I want to ask the Minister whether the  Occupational  Health  and
Safety Act of 1993, in conjunction with the  Driven  Machinery  Regulations,
and the  General  Machinery  Regulations  of  1988,  and  the  Environmental
Regulations of  1987,  made  by  the  former  apartheid  regime,  are  still
compatible with the current transformation of various statutory bodies,  and
the  promotion  and  improvement  of  stable  labour  relations  and  safety
requirements at the workplace.

The accident that occurred yesterday at the Saldanha steel plant,  in  which
three workers were killed and another two injured, and  the  incident  which
occurred in Gauteng two years ago, during  which  a  horrific  factory  fire
killed many workers, are but a few examples that highlight that  the  Labour
department's occupational safety inspectorate remains understaffed.

While the Minister is  doing  sterling  work  in  the  promotion  of  labour
relations and the improvement of  basic  conditions  of  employment,  it  is
alarming to note that farmworkers, particularly in Limpopo  and  Mpumalanga,
are  still  living  under  appalling  working  conditions.  Visits  of   the
Portfolio Committee on Labour to various farms in different  provinces  have
indeed been an eye-opener, and a rewarding  experience  for  members.  While
one would not recommend the Mugabe way of  doing  things  and  dealing  with
white famers, one  would  strongly  urge  that  more  inspectors  should  be
employed to tackle the problems faced by farmworkers.

It is alarming to note that many South African  farmworkers,  especially  in
the Soutspansberg area in the Limpopo Province, are retrenched and  replaced
with Zimbabweans, who are easily exploited as cheap labourers.

I believe  that  stricter  measures  should  be  applied  in  enforcing  the
Employment Equity Act effectively, in the light  of  persistent  racial  and
gender inequalities, child labour and the living conditions of  farmworkers.
I know that the Minister's department has done much  to  address  the  child
labour problem, in line with International Labour Organisation practices.

It is, however, unfortunate and regrettable that farmers  in  certain  parts
of this country continue with the old practices of child labour. They  could
not care less about the education of the child and his future. We urge  here
again that more inspectors  should  be  employed  to  address  this  problem
effectively. It is of course true that the Minister cannot perform magic  to
change the mindset and attitudes of those who still stick like glue  to  our
unfortunate past of racial discrimination.

Draft legislation was adopted by this Parliament to  improve  the  operation
of the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the collection of  its  revenue.  The
draft legislation addressed the following shortcomings: The  limited  nature
of UIF coverage and its lack of sustainability;  the  weak  enforcement  and
compliance measures; the right  benefit  structure  and  the  discrimination
against certain categories of employees; and the lack of a  sufficient  data
base of contributors. [Time expired.]

Mr P  J  GROENEWALD:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  toe  die  agb  Minister  in  sy
moedertaal gepraat het, in sy verwelkoming het hy die  volgende  gesê  -  as
die vertaaldienste korrek is: [Mr Chairperson, when  the  hon  the  Minister
spoke in his mother tongue, in his welcome he said the following  -  if  the
translation service is correct:]

No rocks, no mountains  will  stand  in  our  way  to  obtain  the  aims  of
Government. Now I would like to know from the hon the Minister: What is  the
aim of the Government as far as affirmative action is concerned?
I am asking this because I want to say to the hon the Minister that  in  the
second report on a  representative  survey  of  popular  reactions  to  race
relations among all South Africans - conducted by Prof  Lawrence  Schlemmer,
the Vice President of the  SA  Institute  for  Race  Relations,  just  weeks
before the World Conference Against Racism in Durban -  entitled  Between  a
rainbow  and  a  hard   place:   Threats   and   opportunities   in   racial
reconciliation in South Africa, Prof Schlemmer said the following:


  The dominant concern among whites  is  with  what  is  perceived  as  the
  reverse racism of affirmative action and black empowerment. The consensus
  among whites that these  policies  are  racist  is  as  complete  as  the
  consensus among Africans opposing apartheid in the past.

Die blanke jongmense van vandag was nie deel van apartheid nie.

'n AGB LID: Wat is blanke mense?

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Hulle het nie gedeel in die voordele van apartheid  nie,
maar die agb Minister verwag hulle  moet  die  prys  betaal  vir  apartheid.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Die agb  lid  vra  wie  is  die  wittes.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The white young people of today were not part of apartheid.

An HON MEMBER: What are white people?

Mr P J GROENEWALD: They did not share in the privileges  of  apartheid,  but
the  hon  the  Minister  expects  them  to  pay  the  price  for  apartheid.
[Interjections.] The hon member is asking who whites are.]

Hon members must ask their hon Minister because he  is  referring  to  white
and black, if they do not know what white means.

Die VF sê vandag vir die agb Minister hy is  onbillik  en  onredelik  om  te
verwag dat dit die jong blankes moet wees wat die prys moet betaal.  Ek  wil
die agb Minister vra of 'n blanke kind wat in 1994 gebore is,  deel  is  van
apartheid. [Tussenwerpsels.] Agb  lede  sê  ja.  Ek  wil  eintlik  saamstem:
daardie kind is  deel  van  die  ``new  apartheid''  van  die  ANC-regering!
[Tussenwerpsels.] Daardie kind sal die prys  moet  betaal  vir  regstellende
optrede, en dan staan die ANC-ministers hier op en sê hoogdrawend hulle  kan
nie verstaan dat die mense landuit gaan om elders werk  te  gaan  soek  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Ons  moes  vanoggend  hier  kom  luister  na  wat  die  Regering  in   hulle
immigrasiewetgewing doen om mense te lok. Wat doen die Regering om  ook  ons
eie mense in Suid-Afrika te hou, of beskou die Regering hulle nie  as  Suid-
Afrikaners nie? [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die VF het reeds in 1997 en 1998 'n voorstel op die tafel geplaas  wat  gesê
het daar moet 'n afsnydatum  kom  sover  dit  regstellende  optrede  betref.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek wil die agb Minister vandag vra of hy bereid is om  met
'n afsnydatum te kom vir regstellende optrede, om te sê:  ``Tot  hiertoe  en
dan maak ons die speelveld gelyk.'' [Tussenwerpsels.]

As 'n mens vandag gaan kyk na die universiteite en hulle samestellings,  sal
hulle sien dat die meerderheid studente aan  die  meeste  universiteite  ook
swart studente is. [Tussenwerpsels.] As ons dan glo in meriete  en  ons  glo
in en ons wil erkenning gee aan die swart  studente  aan  ons  universiteite
dan is hulle mos op 'n gelyke vlak. [Tussenwerpsels.]  Regstellende  optrede
is bedoel vir  minderheidsgroepe  deur  die  hele  wêreld.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Today the FF is telling the hon the Minister he is unreasonable and  unfair
to expect that it should be the young whites who must pay the price. I  want
to ask the hon the Minister whether a white child born in 1994  is  part  of
apartheid. [Interjections.] Hon members are saying yes. I actually  want  to
agree: That child is part of  the  new  apartheid  of  the  ANC  Government!
[Interjections.] That child will have  to  pay  the  price  for  affirmative
action, and then the ANC Ministers stand up  here  and  pompously  say  that
they cannot understand why people are leaving the country to look  for  work
elsewhere. [Interjections.]

This morning we had to listen to what  the  Government  is  doing  in  their
immigration legislation to attract people. What is the Government  doing  to
also keep our own people in South Africa, or does the  Government  not  view
them as South Africans? [Interjections.]

In 1997 and 1998 already the FF placed a proposal on the table which  stated
that there should be  a  cut-off  date  as  far  as  affirmative  action  is
concerned. [Interjections.] Today  I  want  to  ask  the  hon  the  Minister
whether he is prepared to set a cut-off  date  for  affirmative  action,  to
say: ``This far and then we level the playing field''. [Interjections.]

If one looks at the universities and their composition today, one sees  that
the majority of students at  most  universities  are  also  black  students.
[Interjections.] If we then believe in merit and we believe in and  want  to
recognise the black students at our universities, then surely  they  are  at
an equal level. [Interjections.] Across  the  world  affirmative  action  is
intended for minority groups.]

But it is only in South Africa where affirmative action must  apply  to  the
majority. [Interjections.]

Die agb Minister het dit verkeerdom. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek wil ook vandag met  die  agb  Minister  praat  oor  die  werkloosheid  in
hierdie land. Ek het die agb  Minister  'n  vraag  gevra,  en  sy  amptelike
syfers lui dat die land, gemeet aan die streng definisie  van  werkloosheid,
'n werkloosheidsyfer van 26,4% het. Volgens die wye definisie  is  dit  37%.
Dit is egter die syfers vir Februarie 2001. Ons is al weer 'n jaar verder.

Die  agb  Minister  het  netnou  in  sy  toespraak  daarna  verwys  en  gesê
werkloosheid groei tussen 2% en 3% per jaar. Dit  beteken  dat  Suid-Afrika,
gemeet aan die wye definisie, eintlik 'n werkloosheidsyfer het van  ongeveer
40%.

Is dit bevorderlik vir Suid-Afrika as ons in  die  media  moet  verneem  dat
Sasol nou werkgeleenthede in Mosambiek gaan skep deur die  ontwikkeling  van
gasbronne, maar  dat  1 000  werkers  as  gevolg  hiervan  hulle  werk  gaan
verloor? Stem die agb Minister daarmee saam? Hoe hanteer hy hierdie saak?

Die VF sê vandag vir die Minister, hy kan praat net wat hy wil, maar  as  hy
werkskepping in hierdie land wil bevorder, sal hy  daadwerklike  aandag  aan
twee aspekte moet gee. Eerstens is daar die misdaadsyfer.  Die  wet-en-orde-
situasie in Suid-Afrika sal moet verbeter. Tweedens  sal  die  agb  Minister
moet gaan kyk na arbeidswetgewing. Arbeidswetgewing is  nie  aantreklik  vir
buitelandse  beleggers  nie.   [Tussenwerpsels.]   As   die   agb   Minister
ontwikkeling en werk wil skep, dan moet hy gunstige  omstandighede  skep  en
nie net gaan kyk na makro-ekonomiese aanwysers nie. Nee, hy  moet  ook  gaan
kyk  na  wet  en  orde,  en  na  die  arbeidswetgewing.   [Tyd   verstreke.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The hon the Minister has it the wrong way around. [Interjections.]

Today I also want to talk to the hon the Minister about the unemployment  in
this country. I asked the hon the Minister  a  question,  and  his  official
figures are that, according to the strict definition  of  unemployment,  the
country has  an  unemployment  rate  of  26,4%.  According  to  the  broader
definition it is 37%. However, these are the figures for February  2001.  We
are already a year on.

The hon the Minister referred to this in his speech just now and  said  that
unemployment is growing at between 2% and 3%  per  year.  This  means  that,
assessed according to the broader definition, South Africa actually  has  an
unemployment rate of approximately 40%.

Is it advantageous for South Africa if we have to learn in  the  media  that
Sasol is going to create job opportunities in

Mozambique by developing gas sources, but that 1 000 workers  are  going  to
lose their jobs as a consequence of this? Does the hon the  Minister  agree?
How is he handling this matter?

Today the FF is saying to the Minister, he can talk as much as he wants  to,
but if he wants to promote job creation in this  country  he  will  have  to
give active attention to two aspects. Firstly, there is the crime rate.  The
law and order situation in South Africa will have to improve. Secondly,  the
hon  the  Minister  will  have  to  look  at  labour   legislation.   Labour
legislation is not attractive to foreign investors. [Interjections.] If  the
hon the Minister wants to create development  and  work,  he  will  have  to
create favourable conditions and not only look at macroeconomic  indicators.
No, he must also look at law and  order,  and  at  the  labour  legislation.

[Chairperson, I would like the hon Minister of Labour to note that what  the
hon Mr Groenewald has just said is insignificant  and  that  he  should  not
allow it to detract him from his mission of  development,  and  of  ensuring
that  the  workers  out  there  are  skilled  adequately,  especially  black
workers. The hon Mr Groenewald is saying what he is saying because he  knows
that he is representing a party of white Afrikaner males only.]

That is why even in this Parliament they do not have any person from one  of
the other races. [Interjections.]

The 2002 Budget year marked the  mid-term  of  the  strategic  plan  of  the
department, as adopted in 1999. It is to this strategic period under  review
that I will confine my input today, with  special  reference  to  employment
and skills development services.

The strategic objectives of our skills revolution comes as  a  comprehensive
response to the low levels of skills in our  economy  that  is  increasingly
confronted by the test of  international  competition.  It  is  within  this
context that I join the Minister when he celebrates  the  breakthrough  made
this far. However, the road ahead, hon Minister, remains a bumpy one.

The breakthrough is clear from the level of excitement shown by  the  social
partners, because a revolution that fails to excite  the  masses  is  not  a
revolution at all. On 18 April 2002  the  Deputy  President,  Comrade  Jacob
Zuma, and like-minded South Africans gathered at the Waterkloof  Airbase  to
launch the Moral Renewal Movement. They made  a  clarion  call  to,  amongst
other things, develop and enhance skills,  as  the  lack  of  them  lead  to
poverty,  inequality,  the  breakdown  of  family   structures   and   moral
degeneration.

The ANC-led  Government  is  achieving  its  objectives  of  empowering  and
transferring skills to the workers.  Workplace  discussions  are  no  longer
about  exploitation  only,  but  they  include  issues  of  human   resource
development and production, the future course that  the  company  will  take
and how to shape  the  South  African  economy.  The  breakthrough  lies  in
ensuring that the noble ideal of human resource  development  is  a  success
and that its objectives are realised and prioritised.

For South Africa to succeed in addressing the imbalances of the past and  to
be able to compete globally,  we  need  the  transformation  of  the  labour
market,   economic   environment   and   institutional   changes   for   the
implementation of Government legislation and  policies.  That  is  what  the
Department of Labour is targeting to achieve through the Skills  Development
Act of 1998, and the Skills Development Levies Act of 1999.

Development Strategy. (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[Unemployment is a serious challenge to the ANC-led Government. Workers  who
lack appropriate knowledge, skills and productivity  in  the  workplace  are
not highly productive, which is what causes the decline in the  economy  and
the reduction in job opportunities. That is why  the  Department  of  Labour
came up with the Human Resource Development Strategy as well as  the  Skills
Development Strategy.]

The Human Resource Development Strategy is to ensure the eradication of  the
burden of poverty and underdevelopment in our society. We need to invest  in
our people by providing them with  the  educational  foundation  for  social
participation and empowerment with the relevant marketable skills.  We  will
be ensuring a better and quality life for all  if  we  were  to  succeed  in
this.

hlabologong ya bašomedi ba bona ka go hlaola  mešomo  yeo  e  lego  bohlokwa
kudu mo lefaseng la ga borena. [Employers and trade unions  must  contribute
to the development of their workers by  targeting  industries  that  are  of
crucial importance to our land.]

This will ensure that all workers are able to participate  properly  in  the
economy of South Africa. Lack  of  schooling  has  led  to  an  unproductive
workforce. Many employers support their workforce  in  this  regard  through
Adult Basic Education.

Ke ka moo re ratago go lebogiša dimaene ka ge di  etile  thlohleletšo  pele.
Ba na le bašomi bao ba ka ba go 25 000 bao ba ithutago ba  le  mošomong.  Ka
ge le se na motlogapele. (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.]

[That is why I would like to congratulate the mines for taking the  lead  in
this kind of training. They  have  approximately  25  000  workers  who  are
furthering their  studies.  Since  you  have  no  precedents,  I  call  upon
others.]

I call upon other  sectors  to  follow  suit  in  ensuring  that  all  their
employees are equipped with the relevant skills  to  ensure  that  they  are
able to support their workplaces and their families. The education Seta  has
started a programme where workers in early childhood development,  etc,  are
also developed, and this is being done in an effort to show  that  education
and training start at an early stage.

Lack of experience has contributed to matriculants not  being  able  to  get
employment and so adding to the high number of unemployed. The  finalisation
of leadership regulations led to a great response  by  Setas  in  forwarding
applications for learners who indicated the need for skills and training  in
South Africa.

Together with the Department of Education,  the  Department  of  Labour  has
prioritised ensuring that shool-leavers  are  equipped  with  the  necessary
skills to enable them  to  be  employable.  This  is  achieved  through  the
identification of skills that are scarce.

Ntle le tlhahlo ya maleba, bašomi ba goga  boima  kudu  ge  beng  mešomo  ba
fetola mekgwa ya bona ya go šoma gore na kgone go tšea-tšeana  le  mafase  a
ka ntle. [Without proper training, workers find it difficult  to  cope  when
the employers restructure the workplace in  order  to  be  able  to  compete
internationally.]

Employers  can  always  respond  to  challenges  posed   by   globalisation,
competition and  technological  advances  in  order  to  grow  and  survive,
leaving workers struggling to adjust and adapt on their  own,  and  that  is
where skills are needed the most.

Learnership benefit employers, not  only  in  monetary  terms  by  providing
their employees  with  an  education,  but  also  by  extending  it  to  the
unemployed. The employers will also reach workplace skills targets  and  get
workplace skills experience that will lead to quality production.

They also contribute to the creation of self-employment. This also leads  to
the achievement of increased skills levels and refocusing of  employees  who
are able to realise their full potential.

[In the past, studying when one was already a worker used to be looked  down
upon. It used to be said that learning new skills  as  an  adult  can  break
you. Today, however, I disagree with that sentiment. It does not break  one,
because today, even in this very House, we have a number of Members who  are
studying again. They are doing this so that they may  be  able  to  decipher
and analyse Bills, to ensure that they will  benefit  the  nation  and  that
people in rural areas will be  able  understand  them.  This  means  that  a
person who is studying as an employee will also obtain  qualifications  that
are recognised by the National Qualifications Framework.

I would like to congratulate the  Department  of  Labour  for  reaching  and
surpassing their target of 3  000  learners  by  March  2000.  In  order  to
encourage the people who are unemployed, I would also like to appeal to  the
Department of Labour to find ways and means of seeing to it that  that  down
there, at the provincial level, the people who are unemployed  are  afforded
education and training opportunities and how they can also benefit,  and  to
try and to extend this  to  the  rural  areas,  where  hunger,  poverty  and
diseases are rife.]

I would also like to congratulate the Minister and the Department of  Labour
for the recent announcement that R1,1 billion has been  made  available  for
skills  development.  This  can  be   achieved   through   interaction   and
consultation with the  labour  movement  and  community  organisations.  The
unemployed can be trained to start their own small businesses and be  helped
to access finances. This would lead to their participation in  the  economic
growth of the country and ensuring a better life  for  all.  Concerning  the
Imbizo, I call upon the hon Minister to speed up his programme and  to  take
it to the rural provinces where people are ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, hon Minister,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the
department is faced with a number of difficulties when it comes  to  labour.
The high number of unemployed is certainly one of them.

We have seen major achievements in the creation of  jobs,  with  efforts  by
both Government and the public succeeding in reducing poverty, which  is  to
the advantage of our economy and  contributes  effectively  to  our  primary
aims of overcoming poverty and striving towards social development.

Our labour force is a tool for boosting our economy. Many sectors are  being
set back by health-related  problems.  However,  our  main  setback  is  the
HIV/Aids epidemic. Our textile and mining  industries,  our  boardrooms  and
educational institutions are scary. The MF  feels  that  the  Aids  epidemic
must be taken seriously in our  labour  field.  South  Africa  has  so  much
potential to reach the top, but we as  a  people  must  not  tolerate  these
setbacks if we want to advance.
The MF hopes that the department will pay particular attention to  this  and
perhaps, together with the Department of Health, come up  with  a  programme
to reduce the rate of infection among the workforce.

A major concern for the MF is child labour.  With  the  escalating  cost  of
living, many children  are  forced  into  labour  to  help  fend  for  their
families and themselves. We do  not  want  this.  Children  have  to  be  in
school. They have to be given the power of knowledge. They have  to  empower
themselves  with  education.  It  is  their  right.  They  should  focus  on
schooling and leave other things to  grownups.  They  should  be  given  the
opportunity to play in parks and enjoy Christmas, and  not  be  forced  into
skipping their childhood and worrying about adult matters.

The  MF  is  sure  that  the  programmes  and  policies  introduced  by  the
department will effectively contribute  to  reducing  unemployment,  poverty
and inequality. The budget allocated is quite acceptable, and therefore  the
MF supports the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, eintlik hang daar  'n  groot  donker  wolk
oor   vandag   se   debat,   naamlik   Suid-Afrika   se   steeds    stygende
werkloosheidsyfer; een van die mees kritieke sake in  ons  land  vandag.  As
ons die vraag  van  werkloosheid  in  Suid-Afrika  kan  oplos,  hanteer  ons
terselfdertyd ook 'n magdom ander  sake,  byvoorbeeld  armoede,  misdaad  en
maatskaplike verval en onstabiliteit.

Suid-Afrika se  werkloosheidstatistiek  werp  inderdaad  'n  skadu  oor  die
werksaamhede  van  hierdie  departement.  Watter  formule  ons  nou  ook  al
gebruik, werkloosheid in Suid-Afrika neem steeds toe en die  statistiek  dui
daarop dat 'n derde van Suid-Afrikaners prakties werkloos is.

Natuurlik kan die Departement van Arbeid nie alleen  pa  staan  vir  hierdie
ontstellende syfer nie. In die eerste plek is die Regering nie  die  primêre
werkskepper nie, maar regeringsbeleid moet 'n klimaat skep  wat  gunstig  is
vir belegging, ondernemerskap  en  ekonomiese  groei.  Die  Departement  van
Arbeid is nie 'n werkskepper nie, maar - en dit  is  baie  belangrik  -  die
arbeidswetgewing en die toepassing daarvan deur hierdie departement  is  van
deurslaggewende belang. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, there is actually a dark  cloud  hanging  over
today's debate, namely South Africa's  ever  increasing  unemployment  rate;
one of the most critical issues in our country today. If we could solve  the
unemployment issue in South Africa, we would at the  same  time  be  dealing
with a lot of other issues, such as poverty,  crime  and  social  decay  and
instability.

South Africa's unemployment statistics do indeed  cast  a  shadow  over  the
activities of this department. Whatever formula we may use, unemployment  is
still on the rise and statistics point out that a third  of  South  Africans
are practically unemployed.

Of course, the Department of Labour alone  cannot  be  answerable  for  this
appalling incidence. In the first place, Government is not the  primary  job
creator,  but  Government  policy  must  create  a  climate   conducive   to
investment, entrepreneurship and economic growth. The Department  of  Labour
is not a job creator, but - and this is very important - labour  legislation
and its enforcement by this department are of crucial importance.]

Hon members will remember that President Mbeki stated in his  state  of  the
nation address  in  February  2000  that  our  labour  laws  had  unforeseen
consequences, and these should be addressed.

Today I must state that mere cosmetic changes have  been  made  and  nothing
substantial has been addressed. The labour laws in South  Africa  are  still
not conducive to job creation.

Certain  laws  that  were  intended  to  protect  the  worker   are   indeed
counterproductive. Employers  still  prefer  capital-intensive  rather  than
labour-intensive enterprises and way of management. Existing  employees  are
still retrenched and replaced by so-called contractors in  order  to  escape
the administrative red tape  and  financial  thresholds  prescribed  in  the
labour laws. We need a more  flexible  labour  market  as  a  driving  force
behind  our  labour  laws.  It  should  be  approached  in  a  holistic  and
structured manner, with the  following  goals:  To  encourage  employers  to
employ, not to retrench; to reduce adversarialism in the  working  place  in
favour of co-operation and joint decision-making; to  protect  job  security
as far as possible; to  protect  the  rights  of  minority  unions;  and  to
respect  the  constitutional  right  of  every  employee   to   freedom   of
association.

Verder is ``onregstellende optrede'' steeds een van die grootste bronne  van
vervreemding onder veral blanke mans,  en  ook  'n  groot  oorsaak  van  die
sogenaamde ``brain drain'' wat ons deesdae beleef.  Nou  praat  ek  nie  van
Percy Montgomery nie; hy is ``fair and square'' ge-``drop''!

In dié verband moet die volgende aspekte van die ``Employment  Equity  Act''
aandag kry. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Furthermore, ``unaffirmative action'' still  remains  one  of  the  biggest
sources of alienation, particularly among white males, as well  as  a  major
cause of the so-called brain drain that we are experiencing  nowadays.  Here
I am not referring to Percy Montgomery; he was dropped fair and square.

In this regard the following aspects of the  Employment  Equity  Act  should
receive attention.]

Only affirmative action programmes in terms of Chapter 3 of the Act  may  be
considered. The current wording of ``measures consistent  with  the  purpose
of this Act'' is too wide and open to abuse by employers.

Chapter 3 should prohibit any type of affirmative  action  that  establishes
an absolute barrier to the employment or advancement  of  persons  from  the
nondesignated groups. It should  place  an  obligation  on  an  employer  to
ensure that affirmative action is implemented in  a  manner  that  is  least
likely to unreasonably limit the rights of employees.

It should explicitly prohibit the dismissal of employees  as  a  measure  to
obtain a representative workforce.  First  entrants  to  the  labour  market
should be excluded from these measures. The composition  of  the  Commission
for Employment Equity should be revised to include representatives from  the
nondesignated groups.

Ons moet ook die wetgewing oor arbeidsbetrekkinge groter erkenning laat  gee
aan   die   verteenwoordigers   van   kleiner   vakbonde.   Die   sogenaamde
``centralised bargaining'' moet in balans gebring word met wat  genoem  word
``enterprise bargaining''.
Om saam te vat, ideologies gedrewe ingrepe en regeringsmanipulering van  die
arbeidsmark is besig om te boemerang teen hulle wat veronderstel is om  deur
die wette beskerm te word. Minder ingrepe en groter vryheid vir die  private
sektor waar markkragte binne perke 'n natuurlike rol speel, is die sleutel.

Die VOORSITTER VAN KOMITEES: Orde! Mnr Aucamp, u tyd is verstreke.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Miskien moet ons 'n blaadjie neem  uit  die  boek  van  Europa
waar sosialistiese regerings  die  afgelope  jaar  in  Denemarke,  Portugal,
Frankryk en nou ook Nederland gesneuwel het. Praktyke wat geweeg en  te  lig
bevind is, kan nie die toets van die tyd deurstaan nie.

Die VOORSITTER  VAN  KOMITEES:  Order!  U  tyd  is  verstreke,  Mnr  Aucamp.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We should also allow the legislation on labour relations  to  give  greater
recognition to the representatives of smaller unions. So-called  centralised
bargaining should be brought into  balance  with  what  is  referred  to  as
enterprise bargaining.
To  sum   up,   ideologically   motivated   interventions   and   Government
manipulation of the labour market are starting to boomerang onto  those  who
are supposed to be protected by the  laws.  Less  intervention  and  greater
freedom for the private sector, where market forces  within  bounds  play  a
natural role, is the key.

Mr C AUCAMP: Maybe we should  take  a  leaf  out  of  Europe's  book,  where
socialist governments in Denmark, Portugal,  France  and  now  also  in  the
Netherlands have perished.  Practices  that  have  been  weighed  and  found
wanting cannot withstand the test of time.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Your time has expired, Mr Aucamp.]

Mr S M RASMENI: Chairperson, Minister and hon members of  Parliament,  allow
me to declare my support for and  endorsement  of  Budget  Vote  28  of  the
Department of Labour. May I  also  congratulate  the  hon  the  Minister  of
Labour, Mr Membathisi Mdladlana, and his department under the leadership  of
Adv Rams Ramashiya, the director-general, for the commitment  and  continued
successes registered in meeting the objectives  of  our  Government  through
the focused work in transformation and regulation of the  landscape  of  the
labour market in our country.

The 15-point programme of action represents the department's five-year  plan
from 1999 to 2004.  It  seeks  to  build  on  the  firm  foundation  of  the
achievements of the first programme of action of  this  Ministry  from  1994
and the department's strategic plan.

This strategic plan is essentially a plan for accelerated delivery. It is  a
plan that will effect the commitments and the labour market  programmes  and
priorities outlined in the Minister of Labour's 15-point programme.

The launching of the Human Resource Development Programme and  the  National
Skills Development Programme represents an answer to a clarion call  by  the
President, Thabo Mbeki, when he said:


  We have to pay particular  attention  to  the  issue  of  human  resource
  development. We have  got  to  make  sure  that  our  people  are  better
  educated, are better  trained  in  ways  that  would  help  them  to  get
  employment so that we can continue to address the matter of reducing  the
  levels of unemployment in our country.

Indeed, the legacy of apartheid discrimination and exploitation has not  yet
been overcome. In pushing back the frontiers of poverty, the  ANC  has  been
and still is determined to smash the  colour  bar  which  through  apartheid
laws, customs and practices, effectively prevented the black  majority  from
exercising any democratic  rights,  acquiring  education,  skills,  enjoying
equal rights and opportunities and  sharing  equally  the  benefits  of  the
economic development of our country.

The commitment by the department to ensuring that our  laws  are  compatible
with Government's goals of maximising  employment  creation  and  that  they
further the mission and vision  of  the  ANC-led  Government  is  a  glaring
example of a people-driven and a  people-centred  Government.  This  process
led to the passing, by this Parliament, of amendments  to  three  pieces  of
legislation - the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the  Labour  Relations
Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act - which, for the first  time  in  the
history of this country, seek to extend the coverage  to  domestic  workers,
farmworkers and all other vulnerable workers who were  treated  like  slaves
by the apartheid regime.

The most important matter about legislation and an  institutional  framework
is not only the passing of laws which remain written  in  the  Statute  Book
and the establishment of boards  and  commissions  which  spend  their  time
talking in boardrooms and doing little, if not nothing. The  most  important
matter is the implementation of these laws so as  to  impact  positively  on
the poorest of the poor in order to push back the frontiers of  poverty  and
ensure a better life for all our people.

However, the implementation of these laws is not the responsibility  of  the
department alone. We call on the captains of industry, the  businesses,  the
trade unions and ordinary workers to join in to build our  country  together
in the spirit of Vukuzenzele. We need to shift beyond  dialogue  and  engage
in collective action.

At this point, I should hasten to raise a very thorny issue - the plight  of
vulnerable sectors  of  our  society,  the  farmworkers,  domestic  workers,
security workers and others. The untold sufferings that the people in  these
sectors endure remind me of the history from which we emerged  before  1994.
No freedom of association, freedom of  movement  or  human  dignity  and  no
basic human rights whatsoever. The abuse of  our  people,  violent  assaults
and killings on the farms remain an obstacle to real freedom and democracy.

In Ventersdorp, Comrade Sam  Louw,  MP,  Comrade  Oupa  Kgauwe,  MP,  and  I
convened a meeting of stakeholders to  address  some  of  these  issues.  We
called on the  farmers,  farmworkers'  representatives,  trade  unions,  the
SAPS,  district  councillors  represented  by  Comrade  Maria  Ramphele  and
Comrade Johny Rametsi and officials from the Department of Labour  and  from
safety and liaison in the province. Prof Shadrack Gutto from the  University
of Witwatersrand was tasked to facilitate the meeting.

Some of the issues that we addressed in  that  meeting  were:  firstly,  the
handling of  labour  disputes;  secondly,  the  evictions  from  the  farms,
including the interpretation of the Extension of  Security  of  Tenure  Act;
and thirdly, safety and security on the farms. Some of the sensitive  issues
relating to specific cases of killings were referred to the directorate  for
public prosecutions. These cases and other similar incidents  of  crime  are
not just confined to the North  West,  but  take  place  everywhere  in  all
provinces and these things have  been  happening  for  decades.  It  is  not
something that started yesterday.

The responsibility of protecting vulnerable workers,  to  ensure  that  they
have sound basic human rights and are afforded their dignity, does not  rest
with the Department of Labour alone, but with the Government as a  whole  in
partnership with business, labour and civil society.

In closing, let me raise the issue of the mushrooming of  trade  unions.  We
are aware of and respect the Labour Relations Act of 1995  as  amended,  and
we know that it promotes the rights to fair labour practices,  to  form  and
join trade unions  and  employer  organisations,  to  organise  and  bargain
collectively and to strike and lock  out.  In  doing  so,  it  reflects  the
vision of employees' and employers' rights contained in the Constitution.

However, we must raise a concern that those who abuse  these  rights  do  so
because their interest  is  the  material  gain  derived  from  representing
workers during dispute hearings.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr S M RASMENI: The matter cannot be  left  to  chancers  and  opportunists.
Instead of supporting our constitutional democracy  in  uniting  our  people
and building the nation, it tends to  sow  divisions  based  on  racism  and
ethnicity.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! hon member, your time has expired.

Mr S M RASMENI: it is a recipe for conflict. [Applause.]

Mr S PILLAY:  Mr  Chairperson,  unemployment  is  a  major  problem  in  our
country, and any institution or service provider that is engaged in  dealing
with this problem should be given maximum support. Regrettably, that is  not
the case.

There are 25 registered sector education and training authorities.  For  the
financial year ending 31 March  2001,  in  terms  of  the  Auditor-General's
report on labour, the audit reports for 23  sector  education  and  training
authorities were not finalised. That influences  the  effectiveness  of  the
Seta concerned. Only two Setas had their audit  reports  finalised.  Perhaps
the Minister could give us some reasons as to why that is the case. The  hon
the Minister also needs to tell us what the current situation is.

To further compound the problem for the unemployed and the unskilled,  about
R3,2 billion has been collected as levies for skills  development  and  only
35% has been claimed. Again, this is cause for concern.

Almost all  the  Setas  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  accredit  training
providers, and a case in  point  is  the  clothing,  textile,  footwear  and
leather sector education and training authority. It is  unable  to  accredit
community training providers, as  no  standard  exists  against  which  they
could be benchmarked, even though the Preliminary Annual Report  on  Labour,
on page  10,  states  that  community  groups  and  education  and  training
providers constitute a stakeholder. The hon the Minister needs  to  tell  us
how many have been accredited by this particular Seta.

This Seta is currently busy with a road show. How effective this will be  in
reaching the unskilled and the unemployed, we do  not  know.  We  await  the
results with the greatest interest.

Certain Setas  experience  the  following:  Leadership  problems,  financial
problems, lack of capacity to accredit service providers, and a  backlog  of
applications from service providers for accreditation.

Is the  hon  the  Minister's  department  doing  enough  to  inform  service
providers  and  the  unskilled  of  the  benefits   and   the   process   of
participation and accreditation to enable skills training to take place?  It
does not appear to be so. We would like to know  just  how  much  money  has
been allocated for the generation of unit standards, how much has been  used
and what standards have been generated in the different Setas.

An impressive figure  of  3  203  learners  completed  a  one-year  training
programme. We would like to know where they are now and whether any of  them
are employed or have  started  their  own  micro  or  other  businesses,  or
whether they have been denied access to finance.

The Construction Education and Training Authority is  very  impressive.  For
the 2001-2002 financial year  money  available  for  grants  was  about  R36
million, and the total paid out and  committed  was  R35  million.  Only  R1
million is outstanding.

It would be excellent if all the sector Setas were able to function in  this
manner. It would bring hope and a sense of purpose to  many  unemployed  and
unskilled people. It would revive their hope and belief,  and  confirm  that
they are people with hopes and aspirations, and not just statistics.

If  the  Setas  continue  to  malfunction,  one  sees  nothing  but  further
unemployment in all sectors. With the ever-rising costs of  fuel  and  other
basic essentials, unemployment will be a trigger for a national crisis.

In conclusion, James said: ``Faith without works is dead.''  The  unemployed
and unskilled people are simply looking for a way to earn a living,  service
providers are looking for a way to assist, and I ask the  hon  the  Minister
kindly to accelerate this process.

Mr  G  G  OLIPHANT:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,   comrades,
colleagues, friends, ladies and gentlemen,  our  country  has  undergone  an
historic period of  political,  social  and  economic  transformation  since
1994. At the centre of this transformation is the  achievement  of  the  ANC
Government in the labour market.

We  have  very  good  laws  in  place,  well-functioning   social   dialogue
institutions and a well-functioning  Department  of  Labour  with  selfless,
committed staff who are passionate about their work. We want to  thank  them
for that. The challenges  we  face  are  the  effective  implementation  and
monitoring of our legislation and its impact on society as a whole.

The portfolio committee has, since the beginning of  this  session,  visited
several institutions, such  as  the  National  Productivity  Institute,  the
Unemployment Insurance Fund and the Compensation Commission in Pretoria.  We
want to thank the leadership of these institutions, particularly  Ms  Magojo
and Mr Mkhonto, for their leadership and their determination to  succeed  in
this regard.

We have also visited factories, such as  KWV  and  Consani  in  the  Western
Cape, as part of our oversight role. We  are  pleased  to  report  that  the
majority of employers and workers are doing their best  to  function  within
the law. There are, however, still too  many  unscrupulous  employers  whose
greed  for  profit  maximisation  totally  disregards  basic  conditions  of
employment, health and  safety  requirements,  employment  equity,  and  the
necessity for social justice.

We need to redouble our efforts in strengthening the  inspectorates  of  the
Department of Labour,  the  Department  of  Health  and  the  Department  of
Minerals and Energy. We need  to  finalise  the  integration  of  inspection
services amongst these departments as a matter of urgency. We cannot  afford
another Lenasia, where 11  workers  were  burnt  to  death  in  a  locked-up
factory over a year and a half ago. Neither can we afford to see another  Ms
Nokuthula Hlatswayo, who lost her twin babies after she gave birth  to  them
while locked up in a factory in November 2001. [Applause.]

Comrade Maxwell Moss has  asked  me  to  raise  an  incident  that  happened
yesterday. Six fishermen from Saldanha on the West  Coast  went  missing  at
sea. During the past month 29 fishermen who work on small boats  lost  their
lives. These fishermen, also known as line and lobster  fishermen,  are  not
covered by the Labour Relations Act, the Basic Conditions of Employment  Act
or workmen's compensation.

Research has shown that working at sea is most dangerous, even more so  than
working on the mines. That is the message which Comrade Max Moss  wanted  us
to pass to this House.

We know that, according to the preliminary annual report of  the  Department
of Labour, there has been a remarkable decrease in  accident  statistics  in
almost all sectors of our economy over the past  three  years.  There  is  a
similar trend in the mining industry, and we wish to commend  both  business
and  labour,  as  well  as  our  Government,  for   this   improvement.   We
particularly wish to congratulate Comrade  Minister  of  Labour,  Membathisi
Mdladlana, and his team, business and labour for the historical  health  and
safety accord signed by all stakeholders on 8 April 2002.

There are, however, worrisome factors in the labour market.  Many  employers
are contracting out of formal employment, and  resorting  to  casualisation,
outsourcing and retrenchments. This is in addition to  the  already  complex
problems of unemployment, high levels of  poverty,  rocketing  food  prices,
the HIV/Aids pandemic and the persistent inequality in income  distribution.
According to the latest Mesebetsi Labour Force Survey  Report  over  60%  of
African women are unemployed, compared to 10% of white men.

I want the hon Groenewald to listen  very  carefully  to  these  statistics,
because he is the one ...

... wat baie geraas maak hierso van regstellende aksie.  [...  who  makes  a
lot of noise here about affirmative action.]

Over 60% of African women are unemployed, compared  to  10%  of  white  men.
[Interjections.]

So, die stories  wat  agb  Groenewald  en  agb  Aucamp  hier  kom  praat  is
goggastories. Ons het regstellende aksie om reg te  maak,  en  as  hulle  'n
tydsbeperking wil hê, dan kan ons onderhandel oor 40 jaar, want dit  is  wat
apartheid hierso gehad  het.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[So, the stories that the hon Groenewald and the hon Aucamp try to  sell  us
are ``goggastories''. We have affirmative action to  rectify,  and  if  they
want a time limit we can negotiate in 40 years' time, because that  is  what
apartheid had here. [Interjections.]]

The poorest 50% of the population receive 10% of the national  income  while
the richest 10% receive 50%.

The average monthly salary amongst whites is  R6  131  compared  to  R1  638
amongst Africans. This ratio has shown no change since 1995.

So as ons regstellende aksie wil hê, sal ons hier  moet  begin.  [So  if  we
want affirmative action, we shall have to start here.]

The report also shows that 70% of the income of the  unemployed  comes  from
remittances from other household members who have jobs.  Forty-nine  percent
of the poorest people rely on gifts from  household  members.  Only  15%  of
households receive Government pensions and 1% live on unemployment  benefits
from the UIF.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, is die agb lid bereid  om  'n  vraag
te beantwoord? [Tussenwerpsels.] Hy verwys daarna dat daar 'n verskil is  in
salarisverhogings in terme van blankes en swartes. Dink hy dit is billik  om
dit op die brood van blankes te smeer as dit gaan  oor  die  werkgewers  wat
salarisse verhoog en nie die werkers self nie? [Tussenwerpsels.]

Mnr G G OLIPHANT: Dit het niks te  doen  met  die  brood  van  blankes  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairman, is  the  hon  member  prepared  to  take  a
question? [Interjections.] He refers to the fact that there is a  difference
between salary increases in terms of blacks and whites. Does he  think  that
it is fair to heap this upon  the  heads  of  whites  if  it  is  about  the
employers  who  increase  salaries   and   not   the   workers   themselves?
[Interjections.]

Mr G G OLIPHANT: It has nothing to do with the bread of whites.]

The reality is that white people are earning far more  than  blacks  in  the
country. We have agreed with  that  member,  as  members  of  the  portfolio
committee, that we need to correct this. If we have to correct it,  we  have
to  correct  it  together.  That  member   should   not   come   here   with
``goggastories'' and say that whites are this and that, and that people  are
leaving - which is actually a myth. We have responsible white  people  here,
in South Africa,  who  stay  on  because  they  are  patriotic.  [Applause.]
[Interjections.]

I do not wish to place too much emphasis  on  the  statistics  that  I  have
stated, but I would like to illustrate the complexity of the challenge  that
we face in our fledgling democracy. We are heartened by the  fact  that  the
leadership of the democratic movement is  already  grappling  with  some  of
these issues in order to find lasting solutions,  not  piecemeal  solutions.
[Interjections.]

We emerged from the recent alliance summit as committed as ever  to  dealing
with  problems  of  poverty,  unemployment  and  disease   in   an   honest,
systematic, decisive and responsible manner. The ANC is determined  to  push
back the frontiers of poverty and to grow the economy for a better life  for
all.

Let me conclude by  congratulating  the  Congress  of  South  African  Trade
Unions and its  allies  for  organising  successful  and  peaceful  May  Day
rallies in 28 centres throughout the country.  The  struggle  for  a  decent
living and an 8-hour working  day  continues.  This  historical  demand  and
mandate can never be abandoned.

The National Union of Mineworkers also needs to be commended for their  20th
anniversary celebrations which were held in  Bloemfontein  last  month.  The
Government has already tabled a Bill in Parliament that seeks to change  the
ownership patterns in the mining industry in line with the Freedom  Charter.
If I have the time, I want to quote it and say:


  The national wealth of our country, the heritage of South Africans, shall
  be restored to the people. The mineral wealth beneath the soil  shall  be
  transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole.

So, ownership patterns will definitely change.

The South  African  Communist  Party  will  also  be  celebrating  its  81st
anniversary in July and we wish them well. The ANC is now over 90 years  old
and is the oldest liberation movement in Africa. Sibadala kuwe DP.  [We  are
older than the DP.] [Applause.]

Lastly,  I  have  observed  that  the  hon  Pillay  is   genuinely   seeking
information. I would therefore like to invite him  to  the  meeting  of  the
portfolio committee on Tuesday to come and learn more about  the  Setas.  It
is a genuine offer. But, we  cannot  accept  that  the  hon  Clelland-Stokes
still comes here, at this hour  and  in  this  century,  to  advocate  cheap
labour. Those days of cheap  labour  are  gone  -  gone  forever,  never  to
return. [Applause.]

Comrade Durand, from the New NP, was quite right to say  that  the  cost  of
labour is dropping and productivity is rising. [Interjections.] Yes,  he  is
our comrade now because we have taken  him  away  from  the  DP.  He  cannot
belong in that camp. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, in  the  interests  of  time  and  also
because of some of us are diabetic and need to have some food  now,  I  will
spare the hon members a long response. Suffice it to say that  changes  that
were made in the Labour Relations Act and  Basic  Conditions  of  Employment
Act were not cosmetic - I address this to  the  hon  Clelland-Stokes  -  but
radical and fundamental.

One of the reasons why trade unions in this  country  said  that  there  was
going to be blood on the floor was precisely that the changes that  we  were
making were not cosmetic. The hon member was not there  to  save  my  blood,
but there was no blood on the floor because we debated the issues.  The  hon
member also voted in favour of those amendments. They  were  definitely  not
cosmetic. I strongly urge my dear brother not to try his luck.

I want to thank the hon members for supporting us, but I want to respond  to
the hon Groenewald. The reason why I want to respond, and I want to  say  it
very clearly, is that ...

... i-ANC ayilalanga,  iguqe  ngamadolo.  Makangayibambi  ngesixhanti  ukuba
mayiphakame, kuba uya  kuba  unqika  ilitye  elineembovane.  Aze  ahlale  ke
ezixhokonxa.  Makazixhokonxe  ke  umhlobo  wam,  azixhokonxe  kakhulu.   Aze
angakhali  xa  zimqwenga.  [Uwele-wele.]  (Translation  of  Xhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[... the ANC is not sleeping, it is on its knees. He must  not  hold  it  by
its neck and challenge it because by so doing  he  would  be  lifting  up  a
stone full of ants. He should continue to do that. Let my dear colleague  do
that as much as he likes. He should not cry for help when they are all  over
him. [Interjections.]]

Racism was not on our agenda. It was never invented by the  ANC.  We  fought
against, and we will continue to fight against, racism. I invite my  learned
brother to study the Freedom Charter very carefully.

Angakhe alinge ke umhlobo wam azenzele inyakanyaka ...  [My  colleague  must
not start trouble ...]

... because I want to repeat it. It is not the ANC that invented  apartheid.
All that the employment equity legislation requires is  that  blacks,  women
of all races and  people  with  disabilities,  who  have  been  historically
discriminated against,  must  be  affirmed.  Let  me  tell  Mr  Aucamp  that
affirmative action is not a brain drain but brain gain because ...

... sithi  abantu  ababethatyathwa  njengezidenge,  izityhifili,  iziqihela.
Namhlanje  sithi  aba  bantu   bamnyama   ababonayo   naba   mama,   nabantu
abakhubazekileyo, banayo le nto ephantsi kweenwele. Ngoko  ke  ...  [...  we
are the people who were perceived as stupid, fools,  idiots.  Today  we  say
that these black people that he sees and  these  women  and  these  disabled
persons, do have brains. Therefore ...]

... they must be affirmed ...

...  Mhlekazi  kuba  ubuchopho  banabo,   abulahlekanga.   Akukho   buchopho
bulahlekileyo apha, qha into eyenzekayo, sithabatha obu buchopho  obe  bukho
obuqiniswe bubudenge babo ngoba into abayenzileyo bona basiqinise  ifokotho.
[... Sir, because brains they do have, they are  not  lost.  There  are  not
brains that are lost here, but what is happening is  that  our  brains  have
been made even wiser by their stupidity, because what they have done  is  to
actually strengthen us.]

My warning to them is that ...

... ihashe  elinesilonda  emqolo  aliqatyelwa  ngenkani,  hleze  litelephule
limkhabe, limbhuzule amazinyo. [Kwaqhwatywa.]
[... one does not ride by force a horse that has a  wound  on  its  back  in
case it becomes wild and throws one to the ground, and one loses one  teeth.
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, op 'n punt van orde: kan ek hier  vra  vir
'n  korreksie?  Die  agb  Minister  het  voorgegee  dat  ek  'n  rassistiese
konnotasie  heg  aan  ``brain  drain''.  By  ``brain  drain''  word   bedoel
gekwalifiseerde mense: swart, wit en bruin prokureurs, advokate  en  dokters
wat weggaan.

Ek vra hom om asseblief nie daardie konnotasie aan my woorde te heg nie.  Ek
dink  dit  was  moedswillig.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson,  on  a  point  of  order:  May  I  ask  for  a
correction here? The hone the Minister  maintains  that  I  am  attaching  a
racist connotation to the brain  drain.  Brain  drain  refers  to  qualified
persons: black, white and brown attorneys, advocates  and  doctors  who  are
leaving.

I am asking him rather not to attach that connotation to my words.  I  think
that was done on purpose. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, do you want  to  respond
to Mr Aucamp?

UMPHATHISWA: Mhlalingaphambili, ndiyaphinda  ngesiXhosa  sasekhaya.  Asizizo
iziqihela, asizizo izityhifili, asizizo izidenge. Lo Mthetho  uYilwayo  into
oyenzayo uthi obu buchopho  bethu  masibusebenzise  kweli  lizwe.  Ngoko  ke
akukho buchopho bumkayo. Into eyenzekayo,  kusetyenziswa  ubuchopho  babantu
beli lizwe ngendlela eyiyo. Nantso ke into endiyithethayo.  Andiyazi  ke  le
ayidwabayo. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The MINISTER: Chairperson, I repeat in my mother tongue  that  we  are  not
idiots, we are not fools, we are not stupid. What this Bill does is to  tell
us that we should use our brains for the benefit of this country. There  is,
therefore, no brain drain encouraged by it. What happens is that  the  human
brain is being used by people of this  country  in  an  appropriate  manner.
That is what I say.  I  do  not  know  what  this  nonsense  is  all  about.
[Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: According to my limited knowledge  of  Xhosa,
Mr Aucamp, I think that clarifies the matter.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 13:44.
