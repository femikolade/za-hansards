                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I give notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the overdue expulsion of  Zimbabwe  from  the  Commonwealth  of
       Nations, thereby underlining the  civilised  world's  abhorrence  and
       condemnation of the conduct of Robert Mugabe and his government -


       (a)  in their flagrant suspension of the rule  of  law,  whereby  the
           status of the judiciary and respect for  its  judges  have  been
           diminished;


       (b)  for their brutality towards Zimbabwe's citizens,  who  dared  to
           disagree with the ruling Zanu-PF Party resulting in killings  of
           men, women and children;


       (c)  for empowering incorrigible so-called war veterans to carry  out
           unbridled racist attacks on  white  farmers  resulting  in  some
           cases in murder; and


       (d)  for generally inculcating a climate of intolerable  tensions  of
           fear and suspicion within its own communities;


  (2) applauds the statesmanlike role played by  the  Presidents  of  South
       Africa and Nigeria, two of Africa's  major  nations,  in  ostracising
       Zimbabwe; and


  (3) requests that the South African  President  does  everything  in  his
       power to bring Zimbabwe back to normality.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, I  shall  move  at  the  next  sitting  of  this
Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Zanu-PF and  Robert  Mugabe  have  retained  the  Presidency  of
           Zimbabwe  by  illegitimate  means  in  the  recent  presidential
           elections;


       (b)  this has been confirmed by the overwhelming  mass  of  objective
           and trained observers that have monitored these elections;


       (c)  those who supported the  rape  of  democracy  in  Zimbabwe  were
           either driven by fear, blind loyalty or misplaced self-interest;
           and


       (d)  many former guerilla movements seem  to  think  solidarity  with
           their erstwhile comrades is more important than human rights, or
           the progress of Africa, through inter alia Nepad and the advance
           of liberty and democracy;


  (2) calls upon South Africans and Africans to mobilise against  this  new
       form of oppression where the ballot  box  is  abused  to  deny  human
       rights; and


  (3) calls upon the South African Government to  put  blue  water  between
       ourselves and states that abuse human and democratic rights  and  the
       rule of law.
Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that tomorrow, 21 March, is International Human Rights Day;


  (2) further notes that in Palestine human rights continue to be  violated
       because people have been detained in  concentration  camps  in  their
       homeland for over 25 years;


  (3) is disturbed by the vengeful actions of the  Israeli  Prime  Minister
       using weapons of  mass  destruction  as  a  military  solution  to  a
       political problem;


  (4) gravely grieves at Palestinian  and  Israeli  lives  that  are  being
       destroyed, bodies maimed and blood spilled;


  (5) prays that Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat strive for a peacefully negotiated
       settlement; and
  (6) finally prays  that  during  Passover  and  Lent  reconciliation  and
       compassion may abound to all concerned because we need and love  them
       all.

Umntwana B Z  ZULU:  Sihlalo,  ngifisa  ukukhipha  isaziso  sokuthi  uma  le

       receiving hearing aids, which was Mr Mandela's initiative - they  too

  (6) says: Forward Madiba, hero of Africa, honourable man!]

       have made their choice; and


  (5) calls upon Zimbabweans to start the process of  striving  for  unity,
       reconciliation and reconstruction.

                              HUMAN RIGHTS DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that tomorrow, 21 March 2002, is South  Africa's  Human  Rights
       Day which is in recognition of the sacrifices that were made  by  the
       people of Sharpeville in the fight against apartheid abuses of  human
       rights;


  (2) further notes that this historic day coincides with the International
       Day for the Eradication of Racial Discrimination;


  (3) acknowledges that this day affirms the commitment by both  the  South
       African Government and the international community to  protect  human
       rights;


  (4) expresses its concerns over the continuation of human  rights  abuses
       in countries such as Nigeria, Sudan, India,  Pakistan,  Zimbabwe  and
       Palestine;


  (5) calls on the communities in these countries to exercise tolerance and
       accept the right of people to hold  different  political,  religious,
       social and economic views;


  (6) further calls on  all  South  Africans  to  work  together  with  the
       international community in the  promotion  and  protection  of  human

                             NATIONAL WATER WEEK

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) acknowledges that humans tend to consume natural  resources  such  as
       water faster than they can be replaced;


  (2) further acknowledges that  failure  to  manage  our  water  resources
       effectively  can   cause   water   scarcity   which,   coupled   with
       underdevelopment, will doom the poor to a state of eternal poverty;


  (3) believes that water is a precious resource which all  South  Africans
       must learn to manage  responsibly  in  the  interest  of  sustainable
       development and poverty relief;


  (4) welcomes therefore the announcement by the Minister of Water  Affairs
       and Forestry that 18-24 March has been declared National Water  Week;
       and


  (5) calls on all South Africans to follow the lead of the Minister and to
       find creative ways to conserve our precious water resources.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          VALLEY OF THE ZULU KINGS

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) applauds the  announcement  made  by  the  MEC  for  Agriculture  and
       Environmental Affairs in the  KwaZulu-Natal  Legislature,  Mr  Narend
       Singh, that an application had been made to have the  valley  of  the
       Zulu Kings, the "Emakhosini Area" near Ulundi, declared  one  of  the
       World Heritage Sites;


  (2) acknowledges the importance of the area where most of the Zulu  Kings
       from the 16th and 17th centuries were laid to rest;


  (3) expresses the hope that many impoverished communities living  in  the
       Valley of the Zulu Kings will benefit substantially if it is declared
       a World Heritage Site; and


  (4) notes  with  pleasure  that  such  developments  in  that  area  will
       contribute to ecotourism as well as the economy of the country  as  a
       whole.

The Chief Whip of the Council moved as an  amendment:  That,  in  paragraphs
(1) and (3), the word "World" be substituted by the word "National".

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I accept the amendment with thanks.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely:

       whole.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) in die lig van ons viering van Menseregtedag  môre,  die  doodsvonnis
       deur steniging wat 'n Nigeriese hof opgelê het aan 'n 35-jarige vrou,
       Safiya Husaini, wat aan owerspel skuldig bevind is nadat sy  'n  baba

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) in the light  of  our  celebration  of  Human  Rights  Day  tomorrow,
       condemns in the strongest terms the sentencing to death by stoning of
       a 35-year-old woman, Safiya Husaini, who was found guilty of adultery
       by a Nigerian court after  giving  birth  to  a  baby  without  being
       married; and


  (2) calls on our Government to urgently request the government of Nigeria
       through diplomatic channels not to execute this cruel sentence.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.]

         BUILDING OF CLASSROOMS AT MUTSHALINGANA, NORTHERN PROVINCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)   with  appreciation  the  involvement  of  the   Department   of
           Correctional Services in a Northern Province Poverty Alleviation
           project at Mutshalingana Primary School;


       (b)  that during August 2001, the community leaders of Mutshalingana,
           a village in the former Venda, reached out to the Government  to
           assist them with the building of  classrooms  at  their  primary
           school, as some students had to sit under trees in order to  get
           their lessons;


       (c)  that  this  started  the  process  whereby  the  Departments  of
           Correctional Services, of Public Works  and  of  Education  came
           together and decided what roles to play to assist the people  in
           need; and


       (d)  that the Department  of  Correctional  Services  in  Thohoyandou
           provided labour in the form of 11 prisoners, who originate  from
           the very same area to perform the task, which proved to be  very
           successful and fruitful; and


  (2) commends the Department of Correctional  Services,  the  MEC  in  the
       province and the prisoners for the dedication and commitment  to  the
       needs of the community.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 LAUNCH OF PARLIAMENTARY MILLENNIUM PROJECT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Presiding Officers of  both  Houses,  the  National
       Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, for the launching  of
       the Parliamentary Millennium Project, which took place today  in  the
       Queen's Gallery, adjoining the National Council of Provinces;


  (2) notes that the Parliamentary Millennium Project gives  expression  to
       the commitment of Parliament to the  African  Renaissance,  and  also
       seeks to promote dialogue and celebrate the diversity of  views  held
       by South Africans; and


  (3) further notes that it is a method or  a  means  of  giving  authentic
       expression to the history of this country and  its  diverse  cultures
       and languages.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          WEARING OF PARTY COLOURS

                                 (Statement)

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Chairperson,  perhaps  before  I  move  the
resolution printed in my name, I should just comment on  my  observation  of
an unusual feature in our House today, and that  is  the  wearing  of  party
colours by some  of  our  members.  This  is  an  unusual  occurrence  in  a
parliament, and I am not sure it should be  encouraged,  because  I  believe
that the wearing of colours perhaps should reside in  the  party-campaigning
domain rather than in the House, where we engage with each other as  elected
representatives. This is something I would ask our colleagues to consider.

        APPOINTMENT OF MR M COETZEE AS DEPUTY SECRETARY TO PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Chairperson,  I  move  the  draft  resolution
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:

That the Council, on the recommendation of the Chairperson of  the  National
Council of Provinces and the Speaker of the National Assembly,  appoints  Mr
M Coetzee as Deputy Secretary to Parliament with effect from 15 April 2002.

Members will be fully aware  of  our  intention,  through  the  Joint  Rules
Committee, the Rules Committees of the NCOP and the  National  Assembly,  to
seek to improve our ability, through  the  Parliamentary  Service,  to  more
effectively  manage  the  executive  administrative  obligations  that   the
Secretary to Parliament holds.

This new appointee, the Deputy Secretary,  will,  we  believe,  enhance  our
ability to contribute in the manner already indicated  by  the  Joint  Rules
Committee. I would ask for the  House's  support  for  this  recommendation.
[Applause.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      SOCIAL GRANTS APPROPRIATION BILL

       (Consideration of Bill and Report of Select Committee thereon)

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, the Bill we are considering today is,  amongst
other things, the result of one of the pieces  of  legislation,  called  the
Public Finance Management Act, from which the executive  cannot  appropriate
funds without first coming to Parliament for approval.

On 31 March 1998 regulations were promulgated  in  the  national  Government
Gazette. These were regulations 10  and  11.  In  terms  of  regulation  10,
beneficiaries must be paid their grants from the time when  they  apply  for
the grant - the date of application. For instance,  if  one  applies  for  a
grant today, on 20 March, one should be paid from the said date onwards.

Regulation 11 indicated that beneficiaries  should  only  get  their  grants
from the date  on  which  the  application  was  approved,  resulting  in  a
contradiction between the  two  regulations.  As  a  result,  a  person  who
applied for a pension two years ago,  for  example,  only  got  his  or  her
pension at the time when the application was  approved.  We  all  know  that
some provinces take 20 months to approve an  application,  while  some  take
three months and others take six months. [Interjections.]

Provinces are trying their level best to reduce the waiting period of  these
applications so that beneficiaries can receive the grants sooner. This  Bill
tries to deal with the backlog which resulted because of these  regulations.
As a result, these regulations have been invalidated.

The trustees of the Black Sash took the issue to court. They reached an out-
of-court settlement  with  the  Department  of  Social  Development  and  an
agreement on 11 September 2001 when the  Twin  Towers  fell.  The  agreement
reached between the Department  of  Social  Development  and  the  board  of
trustees of the Black Sash was a major victory in our country.

The Bill before us provides for the appropriation of  these  funds  for  all
nine provinces to ensure that the people who were disadvantaged as a  result
of this regulation get what rightfully belongs to them. Funds will  then  be
allocated in the form of conditional grants to all nine provinces, based  on
the estimated number of beneficiaries per province. There is a breakdown  of
how many beneficiaries there are and how much provinces are  going  to  get.
The conditions pertaining to these grants are the same as those  which  were
stipulated in the Division of Revenue Act of 2001.

I am of the opinion that the passing of this piece of legislation  is  quite
important. I think that it is  incumbent  upon  all  of  us  as  members  of
Parliament, including the  Black  Sash,  to  ensure  that  these  moneys  go
directly to the people for whom they are intended, to look  at  the  methods
of how these moneys will be paid to the beneficiaries and  to  ensure  their
protection from dangers that may arise as a result of receiving  these  huge
amounts of money. As we know, people who normally receive R550 or R670  will
all of a sudden receive R2 000 or R3 000 and that, in our opinion, may  have
unintended consequences. We have heard of cases in which  people  have  been
abused and harassed by their relatives and next of kin, and  of  many  other
incidents. We must all make sure,  as  public  representatives,  that  these
moneys do indeed go to these people.

Another point I want to make is that all the beneficiaries who are going  to
get this lump sum -  whether  in  the  form  of  child  care  grants,  child
dependency grants, foster care grants, old age grants, or disability  grants
- must be aware of the fact that these moneys are only going to be  paid  up
to the point at which the backdating  ends.  This  is  not  going  to  be  a
permanent feature in their monthly income. That must be clearly  understood.
As we go into recess and the constituency period all members must make  sure
that this message is properly communicated.

In my opinion no one other than the ANC could have come to such a  decision,
because the ANC cares about the  poor  people  in  this  country,  and  will
continue to care about poor people in this country. This proceeds  from  the
point I made yesterday. In my opinion all these things are in line with  the
Constitution of this  country  -  in  Chapter  2:  the  Bill  of  Rights  on
socioeconomic rights - and it is incumbent upon of all of us  to  make  sure
that these rights are realised. With this piece of legislation I think  that
are trying to make sure that these kinds of rights  are  enforced  and  that
people benefit from the supreme law of this land that we are  all  so  proud
to talk about from time to time.

The ANC lives and the ANC leads and I urge  members  to  support  this  Bill
unreservedly. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, dit verskaf my  groot  vreugde  om  vandag
namens my party hierdie  stuk  wetgewing  te  steun.  Ek  sê  vreugde,  want
hierdie wetsontwerp, sodra dit as wet in  werking  gestel  word,  sal  groot
vreugde verskaf aan baie duisende mense. Aangesien  dit  môre  Menseregtedag
is, dink ek dat vandag die geskikste dag is om hierdie wetsontwerp  goed  te
keur.

Volgens die raming van die Departement  van  Maatskaplike  Ontwikkeling  sal
2,9 miljoen  begunstigdes,  mense  onder  die  armstes  van  armes,  by  die
wetgewing baat. Genoemde 2,9 miljoen mense is maar  net  10%  van  die  26,9
miljoen mense wat volgens 'n onlangse studie, gedoen deur mnr Mike  Sampson,
onder die absolute armoedevlak van R400 per maand per volwassene lewe.

Hoewel dit die geval is, maak dit tog 'n groot deel, naamlik  20%,  uit  van
die 10,4 miljoen mense wat onder absoluut haglike omstandighede  lewe,  waar
die hele gesin minder as R195 per maand verdien. Die bedrag van R2  miljard,
waarvoor hierdie stuk wetgewing voorsiening maak, gaan geneem word  uit  die
nasionale inkomstefonds vir die finansiering  van  opgehoopte  agterstallige
uitbetalings aan pensioentrekkers en ander begunstigdes. Dit gaan beslis  'n
ontsaglike verskil maak in die lewe van hierdie mense.

Die   agterstallige   uitbetalings   is   die   gevolg   van    verskillende
omstandighede, byvoorbeeld die uitfasering van  poskantore  as  betaalpunte.
Die oorplasing van betaling aan  begunstigdes  na  alternatiewe  betaalpunte
het blykbaar nie volgens plan verloop nie. Hoewel hierdie  proses  reeds  in
April 2001 begin is, is daar nog steeds begunstigdes wat sedert  April  2001
nie weer pensioen ontvang het nie.

Sommige name het om onverklaarbare redes van die  lyste  verdwyn,  ander  se
toelaes  is  skielik  net  opgeskort  weens  foute  wat  ingesluip  het  met
herregistrasie. Daar was ook vertragings in goedkeuring vir  pensioene.  Dit
wil dus voorkom asof baie van die oorsake wel voorkom kon  gewees  het  deur
die  verskillende  departemente  vir  maatskaplike   ontwikkeling   in   die
provinsies.

Dit sou beslis baie beter gewees het indien die provinsies  die  agterstande
kon voorkom het. Dit sou nie net baie  hartseer,  en  die  ellende  wat  dit
veroorsaak het, voorkom het nie, maar van die gelde wat nou vir  agterstande
aangewend moet  word,  kon  dalk  vir  ander  doeleindes  in  welsynsdienste
aangewend gewees het.

Daar bestaan reeds groot kommer oor kinders wat net eenvoudig  verwerp  word
deur pleegouers nadat hulle die ouderdom van sewe jaar bereik  het,  en  nie
meer vir die kindertoelaes kwalifiseer nie.  Van  die  R2  miljard  wat  ons
vandag  goedkeur,  sou  dalk  aangewend  kon  word  vir  die  betaling   van
kinderondersteuningstoelaes vir kinders ouer as sewe jaar.

Ek wil afsluit deur te sê dat die lewering van welsynsdienste nie  net  deur
die Regering gedoen kan word nie. Dit is elkeen van ons se  plig  om  skouer
aan die wiel te sit. Soos ons in Sotho sê:

Letshwele le beta poho. [Vele hande maak ligte werk.]

Die  Nuwe   NP   steun   die   wetsontwerp.   [Tussenwerpsels.]   [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P  J  C  NEL:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  take  pleasure  in  supporting  this
legislation on behalf of my party today. I say a pleasure, because  as  soon
as this Bill is implemented as an Act, it will bring great joy to  thousands
of people. Since it is Human Rights Day tomorrow I think that today  is  the
most appropriate day to approve this Bill.

According to the estimate  of  the  Department  of  Social  Development  2,9
million beneficiaries, some among the poorest  of  the  poor,  will  benefit
from this legislation. The  aforementioned  2,9  million  people  constitute
only 10% of the 26,9 million which, according to a recent study done  by  Mr
Mike Sampson, live under the absolute poverty line of  R400  per  month  per
adult.

Although this is the case,  it  in  fact  constitutes  a  large  proportion,
namely 20%, of the 10,4 million people  living  under  absolutely  desperate
conditions, in which the whole family earns less than R195  per  month.  The
amount of R2 billion, for which this legislation  provides,  will  be  taken
from the national revenue fund for the funding of accumulated back  payments
to  pensioners  and  other  beneficiaries.  This  will  definitely  make  an
enormous difference to the lives of these people.

The back payments are the result of various circumstances, for  example  the
phasing out of post offices as  pay-points.  The  transfer  of  payments  to
beneficiaries to alternative pay-points apparently did not go  according  to
plan. Although this process was started as far back as in April  2001  there
are still beneficiaries who have not received another  pension  since  April
2001.

The names of  some  people  disappeared  from  the  lists  for  unexplicable
reasons, and the grants of some were suddenly simply suspended as  a  result
of mistakes that occurred during  reregistration.  There  were  also  delays
with regard to approval for pensions. It therefore seems as if many  of  the
causes could indeed have been  prevented  by  the  various  departments  for
social development in the provinces.

It would definitely have been  much  better  if  the  provinces  could  have
prevented the delays. Not  only  would  this  have  prevented  much  of  the
heartache and the misery it caused, but some of the funds which must now  be
utilised for delays, could perhaps have been utilised for other purposes  in
welfare services.

There is serious concern about children who are  simply  being  rejected  by
foster parents after the children have reached the age of  seven  years  and
no longer qualify for the children's allowances. Perhaps a part  of  the  R2
billion we are approving today could have been utilised  for  the  repayment
of the child support grants for children of over seven years of age.

I want to conclude by saying that the delivery of  welfare  services  cannot
be made by the Government alone. It is the duty of each of  us  to  put  the
shoulder to the wheel. As we say in Sotho: Letshwele  le  beta  poho.  [Many
hands make light work.]

The New NP supports the Bill. [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon Deputy Ministers, members, the  UDM  submits
that we should all welcome this Bill because it seeks to address the  plight
of the poor people of this country who  were  deprived  of  their  right  to
receive back pay that accrued to them owing to delays  in  the  finalisation
of applications. It is neither important nor relevant now  to  question  why
Regulation 11 of 1998 repealed Regulation 10, as the former placed  no  time
limits on the claiming of arrears  and  it  also  stipulated  that  benefits
accrue from the date of application rather than on approval.

We acknowledge, however, that the new  regulation  effectively  puts  social
grants beneficiaries at a disadvantage when claims for arrears were  limited
to three months only. What really matters now is  the  positive  steps  that
the Government is taking to  restore  people's  rights  and  make  good  the
losses they have suffered.

But there is still a hurdle to contend with, and that is the  implementation
of the provision  of  this  Bill  by  the  provinces.  How  do  we  identify
deserving cases for these benefits? Do welfare officers  have  the  capacity
to round up all the beneficiaries involved? Do  we  have  reliable  data  to
determine precisely the period during which such  arrears  were  payable  in
respect of each beneficiary? How do we deal with the risk of fraud to  avoid
the possibility of these funds ending up in the wrong pockets?

It would be in the  best  interests  of  this  House,  for  the  purpose  of
expenditure oversight, if provinces had clear guidelines on how these  funds
should be handled and also if the process  would  allow,  if  possible,  for
direct  involvement  by  or  some  kind  of  formal  representation  of  the
beneficiaries in order to make the process more transparent  and  for  clear
accountability on the part of the welfare officers.

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, on 11  September  2001  the
Transvaal Provincial Division of the High Court, in  the  case  between  the
Minister of Social Development and the trustees of the Black  Sash,  ordered
by consent that Regulation 11 be declared invalid and  set  aside  and  that
the repeal of Regulation 10 be declared invalid and set aside.
The Democratic Alliance is extremely pleased to see this Bill being  enacted
to settle the areas in this case. This Bill takes a first but  crucial  step
in finally settling a period  of  untold  hardship  for  many  social  grant
beneficiaries that resulted  from  the  disastrous  reregistration  process.
Therefore the DA is pleased to be able to support it.

As provinces acted fully within the law and changes to regulations were,  in
effect, made retrospectively, provinces did not budget  for  the  additional
implications of regulatory change and could not have  been  expected  to  do
so. Furthermore the financial implications are  substantial  and  cannot  be
accommodated   within   current   baselines.   Hence   the   Social   Grants
Appropriation Bill of 2002 provides for the funding of  back  payments  from
central funds.

Therefore, subject to the Public Finance Management Act of 1999, (Act  1  of
1999), an amount of R2 billion has been appropriated  out  of  the  National
Revenue Fund for the requirements of the Department  of  Social  Development
in respect of the 2001-02 financial year to fund  back  payments  to  social
grant beneficiaries.

The DA is very grateful that the matter can now be fully  settled  and  that
all  qualifying  beneficiaries  will  receive  the  back  payments.  The  DA
therefore  supports   the   Social   Grants   Appropriation   Bill   without
reservations.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I take it, hon  member,  that  when  you
say ``DA'' you mean `DP''. For the record, we do  not  have  a  DA  in  this
House. [Interjections.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon  members  of  this
House, the Bill before this House seeks to allocate an additional amount  of
R2 billion to the Department of Social Development, the purpose of which  is
to enable the department to  accommodate  more  people  in  the  payment  of
social grants in the current financial year.

This allocation is by no means enough to satisfy the existing needs, but  it
will go a long way in relieving the suffering of our  people.  A  small  bit
is, in terms of our idiom, better than nothing.

The payment of this amount of money is most welcome. It  means  the  payment
of arrears to people not previously accommodated in the  scheme.  This  will
bring relief, happiness and joy to  our  people.  This  generosity  is  most
appreciated, especially when one takes into account  the  economic  stresses
brought about by the depreciating rand.

I need  to  congratulate  the  Deputy  Minister  together  with  his  Social
Development colleague and to say that the UCDP supports the Bill.

Mr K D S DURR: [Interjections.] Chairperson, I get a constant  barrage  from
this member here.  Chairperson,  would  you  please  protect  me  from  this
garrulous member, who cannot stop talking ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON (Mr M L Mushwana]: Mr Durr, you are eating into  your
time. [Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: The point is that nothing would have happened  if  the  Black
Sash had not taken the Minister to court, so we honour them for that.

I would like say to the Deputy Minister that there will be  a  problem  with
security when these people collect their  back  payments.  When  old  infirm
people arrive to receive very large cheques, there would  be  a  problem  of
security which we might want to  look  at  it.  Perhaps  staggered  payments
could be negotiated with individuals, even if those staggered  payments  are
interest-bearing from the time that they apply. Possibly this  option  could
be offered to pensioners, perhaps to be paid over a period of a year or  six
months, depending on the circumstances.

The question of interest would then arise, just as it would if a  legitimate
pensioner  was  deregistered  in  the  reregistration   process   and   then
reregistrated on reapplication. In the intervening period that person  might
have had to borrow money to keep going over that period. So the question  of
interest is something that might have to be looked at.

Publicising  the  new  measures  is,  of  course,  very  important.  We  are
delighted that we were able to receive this  document  from  the  department
today which we will study as we go to our constituencies.  We  are  grateful
for  that.  My  criticism  is  only  that  we  received  the  scantiest   of
information in this case. At the time when we considered this Bill,  we  had
not seen the regulations. I still have not seen  the  relevant  regulations.
That is very important to us as members as we go to our  constituencies  and
advise our constituents. It  would  be  very  good  if  we  could  have  the
consequential regulations that will  give effect to this  Bill  as  soon  as
possible so that we can serve our  constituents.  As  far  as  the  ACDP  is
concerned siyahambisana nomthethosi vivinywa [we agree to the Bill].

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson,  tomorrow  we  celebrate  Human  Rights  Day.  The
rosette we are wearing is a symbol of our commitment as  volunteers  in  the
promotion of civil, social and economic rights. [Interjections.] It  is  not
intended as a party-political ploy, but as a commitment  to  voluntarism.  I
hope that this context is understood and accepted by the House.  [Applause.]


Further, every member in this House should have received a leaflet  entitled
``You and the social grants'' a few minutes ago. This leaflet  was  released
some  time  ago.  It  contains  information  on  various  types  of  grants,
requirements to access these grants,  how  long  an  applicant  should  wait
before he or she receives the grants benefit, payments  of  grants,  contact
details of the various social grants offices, and, lastly,  a  statement  on
the new social grant increases with effect from 1 April 2002.

My appeal to members is that before they leave  Cape  Town  for  the  Easter
vacation, they should please ensure that they  have  a  bag  full  of  these
leaflets for delivery at their constituency offices. This is our  chance  to
make a big difference. We support the Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon  members,  once  more  I
would really like to thank members for the  overwhelming  support  for  this
particular Bill. I will make only two or three points. One  of  them  is  to
say that I think this is really one  of  the  best  ways  in  which  we  can
celebrate Human Rights Day, because this is not just a financial issue,  but
at the core of it are the human rights of  the  aged,  the  infirm  and  the
disabled. I think that it  is  fundamentally  a  human  rights  issue,  and,
therefore, I really think that this speaks to our commitment  to  the  issue
of human rights in this country.

The other point that I would like to  make  is  that,  indeed,  as  the  hon
member Sogoni said, it is going to be important that we  ensure  that  there
is the necessary transparency, accountability  and  correct  application  of
this money, so that the money is not diverted to other channels.

The issue of the protection of old people  from  the  dangers  of  receiving
large lump sums of money is a matter that we are  fully  alive  to,  and  we
did, indeed, ask that some work be done in this particular  regard  to  look
at how best these moneys can be paid to our people. And, indeed, there  will
be staggered  payments  per  grant  type,  that  is  child  support  grants,
disability and old-age grants. So, there will  be  some  form  of  staggered
payment. There will also  be  additional  arrangements,  and  administrative
care with respect to officials who will be responsible for this, but  it  is
work in progress. There is an implementation plan that  is  being  finalised
between the provincial and national Departments of Social Development.

So, the issues that have been raised with regard to how best we can  protect
our people, indeed, are matters that are on hand. I think on  that  note  we
should bring to a close our response to this debate. Regarding the issue  of
the regulation, I think  that  regulations,  in  all  cases,  are  secondary
legislation, and the important thing is simply going  to  be  that  we  give
Parliament an opportunity to comment on  or  to  have  a  look  at  whatever
regulation is going to come in place in this particular regard. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                BURUNDI PROTECTION SUPPORT APPROPRIATION BILL

      (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee thereon)

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, the objects  of  the  Bill  before  the  House,
namely the Burundi Protection Support Appropriation Bill,  is  to  authorise
the appropriation of an additional amount of money by the national  Treasury
for the requirements of the Department of Defence,  to  enable  it  to  deal
with the unexpected expenditure that arose  from  the  deployment  of  SANDF
members to Burundi.

It became necessary to follow the route  of  this  Bill,  because  when  the
President of the Republic of South Africa, President Thabo Mbeki,  in  terms
of the powers vested in  him  by  the  Constitution  and  the  Defence  Act,
authorised, on 26  October  2001,  the  deployment  of  the  protection  and
support services of the SANDF to Burundi, it was then already  too  late  to
accommodate the  funding  through  the  adjustment  budget  process  usually
presented to Parliament later in the relevant financial year.

Furthermore, it should also be noted that the budget of  the  Department  of
Defence, while providing for, inter alia, the  preparation  of  the  forces,
does not include provision for the funding of the deployment of the  forces,
one of the reasons being that there  are  unknown  costs  for  specific  and
sometimes unforeseen deployments.

Therefore, on 12 February 2002, in terms of the  powers  vested  in  him  by
section 16(1) of the Public Finance Management Act of 1999, the Minister  of
Finance authorised the use of an amount not exceeding R130 million  for  the
Burundi deployment. This fact was also announced in the Budget Speech on  20
February 2002, after which a dedicated Appropriation Bill became  necessary,
as a requirement, to put the Department of Defence in  a  position  to  deal
with the unexpected expenditure. The Bill before us is that Bill.

All the above-mentioned became necessary as a result  of  the  Arusha  peace
and reconciliation process,  as  headed  by  the  former  President  of  the
Republic of South Africa, hon Nelson Mandela, as appointed in terms  of  the
UN Security Council Resolution  1286  of  19  January  2000,  one  of  whose
objectives is the achievement of a peaceful resolution of  the  conflict  in
Burundi, a process which, amongst other things, necessitated the  deployment
of a detachment of forces to protect the returning former exiled leaders  of
Burundi.

Complaints and negative criticism aside - because that will always abound  -
the South African Government, and, therefore, by implication, the  whole  of
South Africa, as a dedicated African country, will remain  forever  part  of
the  resolve  to  strive  to  work  towards  the  forging  of   unity,   the
consolidation of solidarity, cohesion, as well as co-operation  between  the
African people and amongst African states.
Let the  patriotic  and  progressive  forces  in  this  country,  those  who
unwaveringly pay their total allegiance to the continent of Africa,  support
the Government in its endeavour to become a meaningful  role-player  in  the
pursuit of peace and stability on the  continent,  a  requirement  which  is
essential as part of a solid foundation  for  the  promotion  of  democratic
principles, the consolidation of democratic institutions and the culture  of
popular participation, as well as  the  creation  of  a  climate  that  will
ensure good governance, the rule of law and economic stability,  that  will,
in turn, result in the realisation of the objectives of Nepad.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, alle moontlike pogings moet aangewend  word  om
oplossings te vind vir die  interne  konflikte  wat  ongelukkig  nog  in  'n
aantal lande op ons vasteland bestaan. Nie net is dit die regte ding  om  te
doen nie, maar dit is ook in die beste belang van al ons burgers, en  daarom
moet ons as Suid-Afrikaners bereid wees  om  ons  rol  volledig  in  hierdie
verband te speel.

Watter beter voorbeeld kan daar vir ons as  Suid-Afrikaners,  maar  ook  vir
die res van die wêreld, wees as ons vorige President,  die  agb  mnr  Nelson
Mandela?  Ons  wil  hom  vandag   opnuut   salueer   vir   sy   voortgesette
onbaatsugtige diens, nie net aan Suid-Afrika en al sy mense  nie,  maar  ook
aan al die mense van ons vasteland Afrika.

Ons van die Nuwe NP steun dan ook graag hierdie wetgewing, en  ons  wil  die
hoop uitspreek dat die teenwoordigheid van ons militêre  personeel  daar  'n
werklike effektiewe en positiewe  rol  sal  kan  speel  om  ook  uiteindelik
werklike en standhoudende vrede in Burundi te bring.  Ons  wil  ook,  vanuit
hierdie Raad, 'n boodskap stuur na al ons soldate en ons militêre  personeel
wat daar ontplooi is, en vir hulle sê dat hulle in ons gedagtes is,  en  dat
hulle moet weet dat hulle ten alle tye ons volle ondersteuning het. Ons  wil
hulle verseker van die groot en belangrike werk wat hulle doen, nie  net  in
belang van Afrika en al sy mense nie, maar ook  in  belang  van  elkeen  van
ons, en elkeen van ons kiesers. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans  speech
follows.)
[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, every possible attempt must be  made  to  find
solutions to the internal conflicts which unfortunately  still  exist  in  a
number of countries on our continent. Not only is this the  right  thing  to
do, but it is also in the best interests of all our citizens, and  therefore
we as South Africans must be  prepared  to  play  our  role  fully  in  this
regard.

What better example can there be for us as South Africans, but also for  the
rest of the world, than our former President, the hon Mr Nelson Mandela?  We
once again want to salute him today for his continued selfless service,  not
only to South Africa and all its people, but also to all the people  on  the
continent of Africa.

We in the New NP also take pleasure in supporting this legislation,  and  we
want to convey the hope that the presence of our  military  personnel  there
will be able to play a really effective  and  positive  role  in  ultimately
bringing real and lasting peace to Burundi. We also want to send, from  this
Council, a message to all our soldiers and our military  personnel  who  are
deployed there, and say to them that they are  in  our  thoughts,  and  that
they must know that they have our full support at  all  times.  We  want  to
assure them of the great and important work they are doing, not only in  the
interests of Africa and all its people, but also in the  interests  of  each
one of us, and each one of our voters. [Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, the quest for unity amongst  African  societies
was first propounded by Kwame Nkruma, the Osagyefo,  ``the  Redeemer'',  and
president of Ghana, the black Star of Africa, who once said,  ``The  Ghanian
independence would have  no  meaning  until  the  whole  Africa  shares  our
victory and our freedom.''

The political developments occasioned by the impact of the colonial  regimes
on independent Africa have fostered the spirit  of  nationalism  in  Africa,
the spirit that has prompted the emergence of movements  such  as  the  OAU,
the Non-Aligned Movement, MAP, SADC, etc. These movements,  of  which  South
Africa forms part, embody the  aspirations,  hopes  and  quests  of  African
societies to live in harmony and security. It is therefore  in  this  spirit
that this House finds itself today engaged in deliberations of this  nature.


A record of success in monitoring peace by the military is the well -  known
factor in Africa. The role played by the Ecowas during 1998 to  resolve  the
Liberian civil conflict, and the successful mediation  for  the  restoration
of peace in Guinea Bissau are cases in point.

Burundi is beset today by armed conflict and political insecurity.

The efforts by former President Nelson Mandela to persuade the 19  political
parties to sign the peace agreement should  be  noted  by  this  House  with
great commendation. Complete peace could not be  possible  since  the  rebel
groups, that is the Forces for the Defence of  Democracy  and  the  National
Liberation  Forces,  refused  to  take  part  in  the  Arusha  negotiations.
However,  an  interim  arrangement  was  reached,  whereby  a   transitional
government was established and  started  functioning  on  1  November  2001.
Alternate terms for the presidency position between  the  Tutsis  and  Hutus
were also agreed upon.

However, one stumbling block still remained. This concerns issues  regarding
the stability of the Burundi army. It is for this reason  that  a  need  for
international  peace-keeping  forces  became  eminent.  It   was   therefore
resolved that Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa should supply  peace-
keeping  forces  to  Burundi;  hence  our  engagement  in  today's   Burundi
Protection Support  Appropriation  Bill,  which  the  UDM  supports  without
reservations. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson and hon Deputy Minister, in terms of UN  Security
Council Resolution 1286 of 2000 of  19  January  2000,  the  appointment  of
former President Nelson Mandela as the new facilitator of the  Arusha  peace
and reconciliation process, to achieve a peaceful solution to  the  conflict
in  Burundi,  was  strongly  supported.  Resulting  from  the   above,   the
Department of Defence entered into  negotiations  with  the  former  Burundi
government to deploy a protection detachment  to  protect  returning  exiled
leaders to Burundi in October 2001.

Despite initial  indications  that  Ghana,  Senegal  and  Nigeria  would  be
involved in providing troops, it is not anticipated that  this  will  happen
in the near  future.  The  SA  National  Defence  Force  will  therefore  be
involved in this operation for the best part of the 2002-03 financial  year,
for at least eight months. The  international  community  has  made  pledges
amounting to R294  million,  of  which  R17,6  million  has  been  received.
Agreements with the European Union, Belgium and the  Netherlands  have  been
finalised, while the agreement with the United Kingdom  is  at  an  advanced
stage.

It is essential for any responsible country, when having to  decide  on  its
military force design, first to  formulate  its  own  political  objectives,
which in turn can only be determined by taking into  account  its  country's
political vision, philosophy, policies and  strategies.  Since  1994  Africa
has come to the forefront for South Africa, and it was essential for  us  to
decide on the geo-political importance of the various African  countries  to
South Africa.

There are three basic questions which should be asked: In the  first  place,
which countries or territorial  areas  are  of  vital  importance  to  South
Africa? Secondly, which countries have a direct influence on  South  Africa?
Thirdly, which countries are of interest to us?

Surely the countries  that  are  of  vital  importance  and  have  a  direct
influence on South Africa are the SADC countries. Here  we  should  play  an
active role to ensure peace and stability and  economic  growth,  but  South
Africa cannot be responsible for the whole of Africa and all its problems.

In  future  we  will  have  to  determine  our  role  very   carefully   and
strategically. In the meantime our troops are there, where they  are  to  be
accommodated, fed and  paid  allowances  and  provided  with  various  other
support services. We cannot renege on our commitment  but  we  request  that
proper estimates and plans be made to ensure that for  the  future  we  have
the  military  resources  and  funds  to  get  involved  in  these  external
operations.

The DA, as represented here by the DP, supports the Bill.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Mr Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and hon  House,  before
commenting on the appropriation Bill, one needs to focus on  the  merits  of
stationing a South African contingent of soldiers in Burundi.  In  terms  of
the Bill, the purpose of stationing them there is to provide protection  and
support services  to  returning  opposition  leaders  participating  in  the
transitional government of the Republic of Burundi. This means they are  not
stationed there for combat or for waging war  on  the  side  of  some  party
there. Their mission is to engender  peace,  which  is  a  scarce  commodity
nowadays.

As  in  the  case  of  other  countries,  the  task  comes  to  us  as   our
responsibility in terms  of  our  neighbourliness  to  the  affected  place.
Traditionally speaking, neighbours are very important  people  to  those  in
their  close  proximity,  and  are  traditionally  bound  to  rally  to  the
assistance of their neighbours in  case  of  any  eventuality.  The  Burundi
contingent of soldiers is based on that principle.

The appropriation of funds for the purposes outlined above is necessary  and
in the interests of neighbourliness. The  UCDP  supports  the  appropriation
Bill. [Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, Deputy Minister of Finance, hon  members,  ladies
and gentlemen, as hon members of this  House  know  the  protection  support
requirement in respect of the Bill we are passing today came  about  through
the Arusha Accords and the reconciliation processes in the region. This  was
given further  substance,  obviously,  when  our  former  President  made  a
passionate plea to all South Africans from all walks of life to explore  the
possibility of our providing much-needed  military  support  for  the  peace
initiatives in Burundi.

It is therefore important that we contribute in a practical  way  and  forge
ahead with the objective of making South Africa  an  integral  part  of  the
processes of uplifting the continent of Africa, given the kind  of  problems
we have faced as a continent in the past, and thus effectively  contributing
to the success of Nepad.

However, there is a point that I need to address. For  hon  members,  albeit
those who support this Bill, then to begin to  create  the  impression  that
one has the kind of countries in Africa that are  less  important  to  South
Africa politically, is, I think, completely wrong. No country is  of  lesser
importance than South Africa on the continent. To begin to think along  such
lines, I think, is sheer political gibberish and  utter  political  claptrap
at its worst. [Laughter.]

As members have touched on other very important issues, which  I  thought  I
was going to talk about, I do not think it will be important for  me  to  do
so, except to say that I hope hon members  will  realise  that  the  general
situation in Burundi is one that  is  very  violent  and  indeed  uncertain.
There  is  armed  conflict  and  political  insecurity,  despite  the  noble
initiatives taken by our leaders, which have led to the Arusha  Accords.  We
must then follow up, in a very practical way, on the work  done  by  Mwalimu
Nyerere, Comrade Nelson Mandela and indeed our very  own  Deputy  President,
Comrade Jacob Zuma.

The point has to be made again that the kind of  civil  war  that  has  been
going on in that country, combined with the drought, has already created  an
alarming humanitarian crisis. One more death in  that  country  is  one  too
many. This country is one  of  the  poorest  in  Africa.  The  situation  in
Burundi is even worse now, given the manner in which  the  scourge  of  Aids
has seriously ravaged communities in that country.

The people of  Burundi  deserve  our  support  in  every  way  possible  and
imaginable. We therefore cannot understand, as I have just  said,  the  kind
of brouhaha the hon Theron raises regarding the issue of  which  country  is
politically less important and  whatnot.  [Laughter.]  I  cannot  understand
this uproar. Therefore support for this Bill on the part of the ANC, is  not
only desirable ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Would you  take
your seat, hon member.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, will the hon member please take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Hon  member,  are  you
prepared to take a question? [Interjections.]

Mr T B TAABE: I am willing to take a question from the hon member.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Mr  Raju,  you  cannot
ask a question. Mr Taabe, will you finish your speech?

Mr T B TAABE: I said I was willing to take a question from the hon Raju.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Are  you  prepared  to
take a question, Mr Taabe?

Mr N M RAJU: The hon member has quite rightly spoken  about  the  spirit  of
Arusha and the spirit of the importance of neighbouring countries. Will  the
hon member agree that that megalomaniac Robert Mugabe across the Limpopo  is
an embarrassment to the spirit of Arusha and to the spirit  of  co-operation
on the continent?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member,
can you address the question and finish your speech.

Mr T B TAABE: Chair, honestly, as much as I would have loved to  respond  to
the question from the hon member out of the respect I have for the  elderly,
I unfortunately do not have the time for such balderdash. [Laughter.]

The point I was making is that, on the part of the  ANC,  support  for  this
Bill  is  not  only  desirable,  but  has  become  an  absolute   necessity.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  call  upon
the hon the Deputy Minister to defuse the situation and to respond.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson,  I  think  the  situation  does
need defusing. Thank you very  much,  Chairperson,  and  thank  you  to  the
members again for their support for this Bill. I must  say  that  we  cannot
but support our former President, Nelson Mandela,  in  the  valiant  efforts
that he has made to create a basis for lasting peace in Burundi.

To add one thing to the points raised by the hon Nyakane,  I  think  all  of
the examples he cited affirm that our future and fate must  rest  first  and
foremost with us as Africans. We must see this as part  of  the  process  of
ensuring that we take charge of our own destiny as Africans, because  it  is
only on that basis that other parts of the world  can  meaningfully  partner
with us  in  whatever  we  try  to  do.  If  we  are  not  willing  to  take
responsibility as Africans for our own  problems  and  difficulties,  it  is
very difficult for other people to  come  into  partnership  with  us  in  a
meaningful way.

I suppose it is fine to raise the issues  brought  up  by  the  hon  Theron,
because there are many reasons for questions such as those to be  posed.  We
are accountable to our people, so we must be able to explain the  things  we
do and why we go where we do. At the same time, I do not believe that  there
is yet cause for alarm regarding the deployment of the SA  National  Defence
Force. Firstly, because we have deployments in the DRC, we have  deployments
in Burundi. That is all part of the Great Lakes region. It  is  an  area  of
strategic importance to South Africa.

The Great Lakes region  is  important,  both  from  the  point  of  view  of
establishing peace and stability on the continent, and  from  the  point  of
view of the economic progress and recovery  of  the  continent.  The  wealth
that resides in those Great Lakes makes that area important.  Somebody  -  I
cannot quite recall right now who - said that the next world  war  would  be
fought over water. That person had in mind the Great Lakes  region,  because
there is an abundance of water in that part of the world.

But I must say that we have also seen horrendous events in the  Great  Lakes
region. We have seen a war with the greatest number  ever  of  participating
African countries. We have also seen genocide in Rwanda, something  that  we
would not like to see again. To have troop deployments in Burundi  therefore
becomes part of that process of ensuring that we  can  bring  stability  and
create the basis, substantially, for  sustainable  peace  and  for  economic
recovery and political  stability  in  that  particular  region.  I  do  not
believe that there is cause for alarm right now.

Perhaps an additional point to be made is that we must  not  fool  ourselves
into thinking that the implementation of Nepad is going to be  easy.  It  is
actually  going  to  be  very  difficult  and  a  great  challenge  to  many
countries. It is too soon, really, to start moaning now. There  is  still  a
very, very long way ahead. In a sense,  this  is  a  struggle,  a  long-term
struggle, for political  stability  on  the  continent  and  for  peace  and
security. It is a long-term struggle for economic progress  and  development
on our continent. We really must not think that it is going to  be  easy  to
do the things that  are  contained  in  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development.

Conflict, however, is on the decline  and  democracy  on  the  rise  on  the
African continent. I think we have to bolster that process. We have to  make
sure that this progress that we are making, this trend  which  is  seeing  a
decline  in  conflict  and  a  rise  in  democracy  on  our  continent,   is
strengthened. We must also see this as part of that. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, I just would like to try to address  the  question  that  was
addressed to Mr Taabe by the hon member Mr Raju. I want  to  make  reference
to the fact that, yes, Zimbabwe has been  suspended  from  the  Commonwealth
for a  period  of  12  months.  There  are  a  number  of  things  that  the
Commonwealth statement makes reference to. Firstly, it refers  to  the  fact
that it is going to be important to ensure that there is  reconciliation  in
Zimbabwe, that there is a recognition of  the  deep  polarisation  that  has
taken place there and that there is a need for the main political forces  to
work together for the economic recovery, deal with some  of  the  challenges
facing  the  country  and  together  try  to  resolve  issues  such  as  the
management of future elections in  Zimbabwe.  That  is  one  of  the  issues
raised by that statement.

The other issue raised by that statement is that the land issue  is  at  the
heart of the crisis in Zimbabwe and that the world will have  to  co-operate
with Zimbabwe to ensure that a sustainable, transparent way of dealing  with
the land problem is addressed, because  it  will  never  go  away.  It  will
remain part of the problems of Zimbambwe. Really, as a neighbour looking  at
the issues of Zimbabwe, we must be concerned about them.

I therefore would not want to answer the question in direct  terms  and  say
that President Robert Mugabe is an embarrassment,  but  would  rather  raise
the wider issues  that  have  also  been  highlighted  in  the  Commonwealth
statement, namely that we really need to engage  in  a  process.  They  even
proposed that the Presidents of  South  Africa  and  Nigeria  should  remain
engaged in seeking to find a solution and that  they  must  appoint  special
representatives who will  pay  particular  attention  to  dealing  with  the
issues in Zimbabwe.

I think that it is important for us to know these things and  to  have  this
wider perspective, because, at the  end  of  the  day,  it  is  not  in  our
interests to see a collapse in Zimbabwe, because we shall bear the brunt  of
such an economic collapse. We must be aware of all these  issues  that  need
to addressed in Zimbabwe.

I thank hon members for their support. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

               CONSIDERATION OF REPORT - LEGAL AID GUIDE, 2001

Chief M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I would like to start off  by  thanking  the
powers that be for making sure that I am the last speaker  in  this  quarter
of our session. I know that this was deliberate. [Laughter.]

For many decades,  in  South  Africa,  the  legal  aid  services  have  been
underutilised by poor South Africans, either because they  were  unaware  of
the services or because the system did not clearly define who qualified  for
state legal representation.

We therefore present this guide, which has been compiled especially for  the
sake of ordinary South Africans, as our Constitution provides  for  equality
before the law. The Legal Aid Board has accepted the  task  of,  within  its
means, balancing the scales of  justice  in  an  independent  and  impartial
manner.
This guide provides that only deserving people  should  benefit  from  legal
aid. The test used in this guide relates to the  overall  situation  of  the
parties. It may well be that a person has an  income  sufficiently  low,  in
terms of this guide, to qualify for assistance because, for example,  he  or
she lost his or her job.

Other factors, however, also play a role as the guide also refers  to  other
means or his or her resources. It may be possible for the applicant  to  use
his or her other  assets  to  raise  what  is  required  to  pay  for  legal
representation. This means that granting legal aid to a wealthy  person  who
has an income would be unfair to the indigent or needy applicants.

This guide addresses these situations and states  that  legal  aid  must  be
refused unless there are good reasons for the CEO's agreeing  to  offer  it.
The Legal Aid Board is required to  determine  where  substantial  injustice
would otherwise result, that is, where  an  accused  is  not  provided  with
legal representation as provided by section 35 of our Constitution.

Therefore the board listed some areas of importance as criteria.  These  are
in cases where the accused could not offer the cost of his or her own  legal
representation; where the accused would, if convicted,  probably  receive  a
sentence of imprisonment of which the  unsuspended  portion  would  be  more
than three months without the option of a fine; where, if given  the  option
of a fine, such fine would remain unpaid for two weeks after the  imposition
of the sentence;  or  where  adequate  legal  representation  would  make  a
material difference to the prospects  of  the  accused's  receiving  a  fair
trial.

In  this  regard,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  the  personal
circumstances of the  person  concerned;  the  nature  and  gravity  of  the
charges;  whether  any  other  legal  representation  at  state  expense  is
available or has been provided; and/or any factor which the CEO or  a  court
may direct a legal aid officer to take into account.
The  committee  would  like  to  reiterate  its  commitment  to  the   rural
communities of this country by appealing to the Legal Aid  Board  to  extend
its services to the rural communities because it is  the  rural  communities
who suffer the plight of injustice more than many of  the  other  people  in
the country.

This guide therefore replaces all previous  guides  and  circulars,  and  it
reflects a carefully designed  legal  framework  which  seeks  to  create  a
balance  between  competing  interests  in  this  regard.   This   committee
therefore welcomes this Legal Aid Guide and supports it in toto.

I now humbly, on behalf of the committee, the Minister and  the  Government,
put before hon members the Legal Aid Guide for this House's endorsement.

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
