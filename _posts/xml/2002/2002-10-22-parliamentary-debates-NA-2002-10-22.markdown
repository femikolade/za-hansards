                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr S K LOUW: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  reports that President Thabo Mbeki was warmly  received  by  the
           people of Greenfields, Bekkersdal,  Roslyn  factory  workers  in
           Tshwane and stakeholders in Sandton when he visited these  areas
           as part of the presidential  imbizo  campaign  in  Gauteng  last
           weekend, and that the masses of our people used this occasion to
           interact  with  the  President  on  Government's  programme  for
           transformation; and


       (b)  that the Government imbizo campaign gives  practical  expression
           to the commitment of the ANC to  the  people-driven  process  of
           change and development;


  (2) believes that the enthusiasm of the people and their massive  turnout
       to those events reflect their unwavering support for the ANC  as  the
       leading organisation for change; and


  (3) welcomes the turnout to these events and the warm reception which the
       people of Greenfields, Bekkersdal, Roslyn factory workers and Sandton
       stakeholders gave the President.

[Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the DA:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the confirmed scoreboard relating  to  the  floor-crossing
       shows that the New NP has failed dismally in its efforts  to  destroy
       the DA;


  (2) notes further that on the final day of floor-crossing the  number  of
       New NP councillors is 305 and the number of DA councillors  is  1077;
       and


  (3) concludes that -


       (a)  the decks are now cleared for the real political battle  between
           the ANC and the DA; and


       (b)  the New NP is irrelevant and will not survive the next election.

Mrs I MARS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with delight that the introduction of the daily  lottery  game,
       Keno, has been delayed indefinitely;


  (2) congratulates the Minister of Trade and Industry, Mr Alec Erwin,  for
       taking note of the numerous and continued complaints  and  criticisms
       received with regard to Keno;


  (3) hopes that the delay in  the  introduction  of  Keno  will  give  the
       relevant authorities the time needed to look at the implication of  a
       daily lottery and the effect that it will have,  especially  on  poor
       people; and


  (4) encourages the Government to investigate urgently the effects of  the
       National Lottery  on  the  poor  and  the  apparent  failure  of  the
       authorities to channel the financial resources to needy and deserving
       causes.

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Comrade Wolfe Kodesh, a  veteran  of  the  ANC  and  of  the  SA
           Communist Party, passed away last Friday;


       (b)  Comrade Wolfe Kodesh served his country as a soldier during  the
           war against fascism, and was a founding member of the  nonracial
           soldiers' union, the Springbok Legion; and


       (c)  Comrade Wolfe played an important role in organising safe houses
           for many MK comrades, including Comrade  Nelson  Mandela  during
           the days of underground work, as a founding member  of  uMkhonto
           weSizwe; and


  (2) acknowledges the contribution made by this stalwart of  our  movement
       and patriot in  the  struggle  to  achieve  a  liberated,  nonracial,
       nonsexist and democratic South Africa.


  May his soul rest in peace!

[Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  at  the
next sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the DA leader in the Eastern Cape, Mr Athol Trollip, called  the
           150 DA members from Bizana who resigned from the  DA  last  week
           and joined the New NP, ``straw supporters'',  in  spite  of  the
           fact that all of them had legitimate KwaZulu-Natal DA membership
           cards;


       (b)  according to Mr Mthembu,  former  DA  district  co-ordinator  in
           Bizana, Mr Trollip bused 15 KwaZulu-Natal members to the  recent
           DP/DA congress in the Eastern  Cape  and  used  them  as  voting
           fodder, with specific  instructions  to  vote  for  him  in  the
           leadership election against the honourable Dr  Tertius  Delport,
           and that Dr Delport lost with 13 votes in this election;


       (c)  the leader of the DP/DA constantly makes unsubstantiated  claims
           that the DA's black support base is growing daily; and


       (d)   the  question  remains,  however,  how  many  of  these   black
           supporters are perceived by the majority of his caucus as  straw
           or fake members only to serve the purpose of window-dressing and
           voting fodder.

[Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges the growing  urgency  of  social  development  in  South
       Africa, especially with regard to  issues  surrounding  malnutrition,
       household food security and poverty eradication  which  have  already
       claimed hundreds of lives in South Africa this year;
  (2) notes that the chief motivating factor behind the introduction of the
       National Lottery was to ensure that worthy causes would be  supported
       in order  to  perform  their  vital  tasks  in  the  area  of  social
       development, household food security and poverty eradication;


  (3) therefore condemns news that R332 million in lottery funds are  lying
       idle in Government accounts,  because  the  RDP  programme  has  been
       disbanded and the Departments of Trade and Industry  and  of  Finance
       appear unable to resolve the matter; and


  (4) calls upon the Government to rectify immediately  this  shocking  and
       unnecessary bureaucratic  bungle  that  contributes  to  the  growing
       perception that the National Lottery is doing nothing except  harming
       the very people that Government promised would be assisted by it.

[Applause.]
Ms N E LAMANI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  the  ANC  Youth  League  exhumed  the  remains  of  its  first
       president, Comrade Anton Lembede;


  (2) further notes that Comrade Lembede  will  be  reburied  in  Mbumbulu,
       KwaZulu-Natal next Sunday,  and  this  event  will  be  attended  by,
       amongst others, former President Nelson Mandela;


  (3) believes that Comrade Lembede -


       (a)   played  an  important  role,  together  with  former  President
           Mandela, in transforming  the  ANC  into  a  mass  movement  for
           democratic change; and


       (b)  served as an inspiration to generations of young people to  work
           towards the realisation of a liberated, nonracial, nonsexist and
           democratic South Africa;


  (4) congratulates the ANC Youth League for giving this patriot  a  decent
       burial; and


  (5) vows to continue working for the realisation of the ideals he  fought
       for throughout his life.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mev die Speaker, hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Huis namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1) in die pas afgelope studenteraadsverkiesing by die  Universiteit  van
       Pretoria, wat op 'n partypolitieke grondslag geveg is, die DA  vierde
       was met 623 stemme, die PAC jeug se Pasma derde was met  676  stemme,
       die  ANC/Sasco-alliansie  tweede  was  met  979  stemme  en  dat  die
       verkiesing deur die Vryheidsfrontjeug en Tas oortuigend gewen is  met
       2008 stemme, terwyl dit betekenisvol is dat die Nuwe NP nie  aan  die
       verkiesing deelgeneem het nie;


  (2) aangesien die Universiteit van Pretoria die enigste  universiteit  is
       waar studenteraadsverkiesings op 'n partypolitieke  grondslag  tussen
       so baie partye plaasvind,  die  verkiesingsuitslag  as  'n  duidelike
       aanduiding van jongmense se huidige politieke  voorkeure  gesien  kan
       word;


  (3) die groei in steun vir die VF aan die huidige politieke moddergooiery
       tussen die DA en die Nuwe NP toegeskryf kan word, asook die taaldebat
       rondom universiteite, aangesien die  posisie  van  Afrikaans  by  die
       Universiteit van Pretoria een van die belangrike temas vir die VF  se
       verkiesingsveldtog was; en


  (4) die uitslag by Tukkies die groei wat die VF die afgelope tyd landswyd
       op alle vlakke ervaar, bevestig en dat die verkiesing in 2004 hierdie
       tendens verder sal bevestig.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) in the recent student council election at the University of  Pretoria
       that was fought on a party-political basis, the DA  was  fourth  with
       623 votes, the PAC youth's Pasma third with 676 votes, the  ANC/Sasco
       alliance  second  with  979  votes,  and  that   the   election   was
       convincingly won by the Freedom Front Youth and Tas with 2008  votes,
       while it is significant that the New NP did not  participate  in  the
       election;


  (2) since the University of Pretoria is the  only  university  where  the
       student council elections take place on a party-political basis among
       so many political parties, the result of the election can be seen  as
       a clear indication of the youth's current political preferences;


  (3) the growth in support for the FF can be  attributed  to  the  current
       political mudslinging between the DA and the New NP, as well  as  the
       language debate concerning universities, seeing that the position  of
       Afrikaans at the University of Pretoria was one of the most important
       themes of the FF's election campaign; and


  (4) the outcome at Tukkies confirms the growth that the FF  has  recently
       been experiencing at all levels throughout the country, and that  the
       election in 2004 will further confirm this trend.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of Azapo:
  That the House -


  (1) notes the increase in  the  levels  of  unemployment,  the  deepening
       poverty and ever escalating food prices;


  (2) notes further that -


       (a)   these  are  the  results  of  the  Government's   macroeconomic
           policies;


       (b)   whilst  recognising  the  relief  programme  initiated  by  the
           Government, Azapo  nonetheless  believes  that  the  issuing  of
           vouchers and other measures  are  not  a  sustainable  solution,
           unless accompanied by job creation programmes; and


       (c)  Azapo urges the Government to speed up  land  redistribution  so
           that the people can produce food on their own as a  strategy  to
           alleviate poverty and reduce unemployment.

Ms X C MAKASI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the theme for this month is ``the protection of the rights
       of the child'';


  (2) further notes that Pretoria High Court Judge Eben Jordaan sentenced a
       Roodepoort couple for murdering their child and for assault with  the
       intent to do grievous bodily harm to their second child;


  (3) believes that child abuse is  a  gross  human  rights  violation,  is
       barbaric and inhumane;


  (4) further believes that the courts, the law  enforcement  officers  and
       the people as a whole have a duty to protect children, to uphold  and
       to defend the rights of children;


  (5) welcomes the sentence against the couple; and
  (6) hopes that this sentence will serve  as  a  deterrent  to  others  to
       desist from such barbaric acts.

[Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  at  the
next sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the DA:


  That this House -


  (1) notes that President Mbeki's new luxury  jet  was  sneaked  into  the
       country in the dead of night;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  many world leaders use their countries' commercial airlines;


       (b)  the president of Botswana flies economy class, if necessary;


       (c)  the Australian prime minister's new jet is less  luxurious  than
           President Mbeki's; and


       (d)  this jet has cost the people of South Africa almost R600 million
           and will cost the taxpayer R13,6 million per year  to  maintain;
           and


  (3) concludes that this new jet represents the deepening rift between the
       ANC elite and the South African people, and is truly a case of  ``the
       ego has landed''.

[Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that according to the recently published  biography  of  former
       Springbok  rugby  player  Chester  Williams,  there   were   numerous
       injustices that he had to endure as a black player in  South  African
       rugby teams during his time as a player;


  (2) further notes that several prominent black rugby  players  have  come
       out in support of the allegations made by Williams;


  (3) realises that discrimination against a player on the basis of race is
       totally unacceptable and cannot be tolerated; and


  (4) calls on all parties concerned to work together to stamp  out  racism
       and discrimination in rugby and sports in general.

Ms E GANDHI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the hon  Nkosazana  Zuma,
       received an award from the International Women's Forum in  a  special
       ceremony titled ``Women who  make  a  difference'',  in  Mexico  last
       Saturday;


  (2) further notes that this award recognises Minister Zuma's role in -


       (a)   pioneering  laws  that  contributed  to  affordable  drugs  and
           medicine;


       (b)  fostering a better  quality  of  life  for  people  through  the
           provision of primary health care; and


       (c)  efforts aimed at bringing about peace, security and stability on
           the African continent;


  (3) believes that this award is a recognition  of  the  ANC  Government's
       programme to build a better life for the people of South Africa,  the
       region and the continent; and
  (4) congratulates Minister Nkosazana Zuma for receiving this  prestigious
       award.

[Applause.]

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) extends its congratulations to -


       (a)  Ernie Els on his fourth victory in the  World  Match  Play  golf
           championships at the weekend; and


       (b)  Gary Kirsten, who became the first cricketer  in  the  world  to
           score  centuries  against  every  test-playing  nation  when  he
           accumulated 150 runs against Bangladesh;


  (2) acknowledges the credit that our sportsmen bring to South Africa with
       their performance on the world stage.

Agreed to.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes an alleged plot to assassinate a top woman judge, Justice  Lucy
       Mailula;


  (2) further notes that Justice Mailula is well known for her tough  stand
       against criminals, rapists and murderers;


  (3) also notes that the police are reported to have  timeously  uncovered
       this diabolic plot to kill one  of  the  shining  examples  of  women
       judges in our country; and


  (4) congratulates the police for a job well done, and urges the VIP  Unit
       to tighten security around all judges.

Agreed to.

The SPEAKER: Order! I wish to acknowledge, and wish members to welcome,  the
presence amongst us of  the  president  of  the  Swiss  parliament  and  her
delegation, who are visiting this Parliament. [Applause.]  We  welcome  you,
Madam President, and we hope that we will develop closer  relations  between
our two legislatures. [Applause.]

       CONSIDERATION OF FIFTH REPORT OF WORKING GROUP ON AFRICAN UNION

Ms B MBETE: Madam Speaker, I would like to start by  briefly  sketching  the
background to  the  Working  Group  on  the  African  Union,  that  is,  the
parliamentary working group on the African Union.
Hon members will remember that when the President  addressed  Parliament  on
31 October in 2001, he made reference to the positive contribution  of  this
Parliament during the ratification of the  Constitutive  Act  in  2000.  The
President further appealed to us to continue to contribute  ``to  the  form,
content and direction of the union'' before it was launched.

After that particular debate in October  2001,  on  16  November  the  House
formed the Working Group on the African Union so that we could focus on  the
work that had to be done, as requested by the  President.  We  decided  that
this group had to be small.  It  had  to  be  separate  from  the  Portfolio
Committee on Foreign Affairs, which we believe has enough on  its  plate  as
it has to deal with the whole broad spectrum of the foreign  policy  of  the
country. So, this working group was formed, consciously,  as  a  very  small
group, and its members are from the different parties in Parliament.

We were formed, as I have said, in November 2001. Our serious  work  started
at the beginning of this year. As hon members know,  we  are  today  tabling
our fifth report. We have reported on various  matters  earlier  this  year,
including two seminars that we have held in the course of  this  year  which
looked at issues and details about the African Union.

At some point this year  we  discussed  whether  we  should  continue  as  a
working group now that the African Union has  been  launched  in  Durban.  A
decision was taken, on the basis of the amount of work that is still  facing
us in Parliament, to focus on various aspects  of  the  African  Union,  and
that we should continue as this working group. However,  at  that  point  we
issued an invitation to all parties in Parliament to come and  join  us.  We
encouraged hon members not only to join us when we hold seminars on  various
aspects of our work, but to actually join the working group.  I  am  sad  to
report that, in fact, there has not been  any  enthusiasm  from  members  of
Parliament.

We take  this  opportunity  still  to  appeal  to  members  of  the  various
political parties to join us. If one considers the fact  that  South  Africa
is the chair of the  African  Union,  members  of  Parliament  dealing  with
whatever portfolios in Parliament  ought  to  be  interested  in  the  work,
organs, structures and procedures of  the  African  Union,  so  that  as  we
interact with fellow Africans in our work and in international relations  in
particular, we are able to be enriched and empowered by  the  work  that  is
done in this working group.

In this, our fifth report, we propose to convene a  third  workshop  on  the
challenges of the establishment of the African Union. But I  would  like  to
report that this morning the working group had its meeting  and  we  decided
that instead of having this seminar  in  November,  as  we  propose  in  the
report that is before members, we should rather postpone it  to  early  next
year, because we believe that we would benefit, if  we  do  that,  from  the
fact that we have commissioned research.

We have four  different  research  areas  or  projects  that  are  going  on
simultaneously at  the  moment.  But,  in  addition,  if  the  extraordinary
session of the Assembly of the African Union does  take  place  either  late
this year or early next year to consider  the  proposed  amendments  to  the
Constitutive Act, as tabled by Libya, then we would at  least,  when  we  do
have that seminar, benefit from a progress report that would come from  that
extraordinary session of the Assembly of the African  Union.  We  hope  that
members agree with us that it would  be  better  for  us  to  postpone  this
seminar from November to early next year.

I would now like to look briefly at the challenges that  face  South  Africa
as the country that is chairing the African Union. I think  that  the  major
challenge emanates from the fact that we are chairing the African  Union  at
a time when it is in the process of being  established.  To  start  with,  a
process of disestablishment of the OAU is still going on. The  OAU  had  its
own structures which were totally different from the  structures  which  are
being formed on  the  basis  of  the  Constitutive  Act.  So,  the  previous
secretariat of the OAU is currently acting as an interim  commission,  which
is one of the organs of the AU which was launched in July.
The challenge is that we have to be  looking  at  issues  in  terms  of  the
vision and the mission of the AU. We have to give political  guidance  at  a
time when, in fact, there is a lot of work that has to continue in order  to
operationalise the organs of the AU. The four organs of  the  AU  that  were
launched in Durban in July this year are the Assembly, which  is  the  forum
of the heads of states; the Executive Council, which  is  the  structure  of
the   foreign   ministers   of   Africa;   the   Committee   of    Permanent
Representatives, which is the committee of  ambassadors  who  are  based  in
Addis Ababa; and the Commission, which is the structure  which  used  to  be
the secretariat and which headed by  the  former  secretary-general  of  the
OAU, but which is now a commission that is headed by a  chairperson  who  is
currently an interim chairperson of the Commission.

Members will realise that the Commission  is  a  very  important  structure,
because it is the structure that actually drives the implementation  of  the
programme and the  decisions  of  the  African  Union,  and  that  runs  the
headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa. As I say, currently it  is
the former secretariat. The five  regions  of  Africa  are  supposed  to  be
seized with the process of recruiting ten commissioners  who  will  then  be
appointed at the July 2003 summit of the AU.

At the Durban summit it was decided that we need to make sure that there  is
50% representation of women in the Commission  of  the  African  Union.  So,
each  of  the  five  regions  of  Africa,  as  they   nominate   their   two
commissioners for possible appointment in July next year,  must  nominate  a
man and a woman. This is a decision which was taken by the summit in  Durban
in July this year. Therefore we, as South Africa and as  SADC,  need  to  do
our own internal work in the region to consider our two nominees, a man  and
a woman, who would then be considered for appointment at the next summit.

The  importance  of  the  role  of  the  Commission  is  also  crucial,   in
particular, because there are specific portfolios that are headed  by  eight
of the commissioners in the Commission. The Commission, of course,  has  its
chairperson   and   deputy   chairperson.   There   are   eight   additional
commissioners, each of whom  heads  a  different  portfolio.  This  is  very
important for us to note. Even as we think about how we are approaching  the
issue of the recruitment of commissioners, we need to look at the  issue  of
which portfolios we think are the most important.

I would like to talk briefly  about  the  amendments  which  I  referred  to
earlier on and which,  as  I  said,  are  likely  to  be  considered  by  an
extraordinary session of the Assembly, which is likely to sit either at  the
end of  this  year  or  at  the  beginning  of  next  year.  These  proposed
amendments were submitted by Libya. The Working Group on the  African  Union
of Parliament has divided into three  task  teams.  One  of  them  has  been
looking at the issue of the establishment of the AU  and  has,  among  other
things, considered the question of these proposed amendments.

The view of the task team is that a  number  of  these  proposed  amendments
from Libya have the unfortunate effect of moving the  powers  of  persuasion
from collectives in the African Union to individuals. I would like  to  give
members an example. Article 6 refers to the Assembly  and  states  that  the
Assembly shall meet once a year in ordinary session, and at the  request  of
any member state, and, on  approval  by  a  two-thirds  majority  of  member
states, the Assembly shall meet  in  extraordinary  session.  The  amendment
that is being proposed says that at the request of its  chairperson  or  any
of its members, and  on  approval  by  a  two-thirds  majority  of  all  its
members, the Assembly shall meet in extraordinary session.

In our view, it is not a good idea to move that  possibility  of  persuading
other member states to hold an extraordinary session from member  states  to
individuals who sit in the Assembly. We believe that  that  is  not  a  good
idea. Therefore, we are proposing to our  executive  that  this  is  not  an
amendment that should be entertained, and that we should rather  retain  the
term ``member state''. If one retains that language, it means that an  issue
will be considered by a country through its  structures,  hopefully  through
its parliament, and then a position will be adopted  and  taken  forward  to
persuade other member states, rather than a position being  adopted  by  the
chairperson or members of the Assembly, in other words, the heads of  states
who sit in that forum.

I see that the light is flickering. I hope that I have said enough  to  give
members some idea as to what this working group has been doing. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, this being  a  debate  on  matters  African,
allow me the indulgence of fulfilling my family responsibilities in a  truly
African fashion.

The Seremanes, the Moshafis, the Lebekos and the  Segatlhes  wish  sincerely
to thank members of this Parliament for their strengthening  and  comforting
messages of condolence and support during the sad period of bereavement  for
our son, Kedifentse, and  two  weeks  later  for  my  father-in-law,  George
Lebeko. Thanks too for the messages of support that  some  members  continue
giving to Esther, my wife, and my  younger  sister,  Mmabatho,  as  they  go
through their sensitive surgical operations. May God  bless  all  of  you  a
hundredfold.

Re a leboga go menagane. [Thank you very much.]

Inkomo ma swi twa. [Thank you.]

The task before us is to consider the fifth report of the Working  Group  on
the African Union. We have repeatedly  affirmed  that  Africa  needs  organs
such  as  the  African  Union,  the  Pan-African  Parliament   and   related
initiatives, such as the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It  seems
there  is  strong  agreement  on  the  need  for  the  existence  of   these
initiatives.  However,  the  differences  are  on  the  modus  operandi   or
approaches for achieving the various objectives to  make  the  21st  century
Africa's time.

It is also an African self-constructed challenge of two  scenarios  which  I
term  the  ``kneepad'',  cap-in-hand  existence,  and   the   pulling-up-of-
bootstraps, self-assertive scenario. Africa  has  to  choose.  The  Setswana
idiom ...
....mphemphe wa lapisa, motho o kgonwa ke sa gagwe ...  [...  people  should
refrain from asking from others, and work for themselves ...]

... holds true and stares Africa in the face.  Translated  the  idiom  says:
Self-reliance is better than begging or depending on alms and hand-outs.

The Working Group on the African Union was established in order to  consider
the implementation of the Constitutive Act of  the  African  Union.  Without
overlooking the qualitative contents of the reports, it is  heartening  that
in a period of just one year, we  already  have  the  fifth  report  of  the
working group. Do they not deserve a pat on the back?

The introduction of the fifth report states, inter alia, that  two  seminars
were held especially for parliamentarians to familiarise  members  with  the
African Union and related issues. We recommend further  seminars,  not  only
for parliamentarians, but for civil society at  large.  It  does  not  speak
well of Africa's ministers of finance, and ministers of trade  and  industry
to have scant information on Nepad,  etc.  What  about  the  people  on  the
ground if that is the case?

The aforegoing therefore  endorses  the  report's  recommendation  that  the
working group be mandated to continue with its work on  the  African  Union,
no mean  task,  I  must  say.  We  support  this  recommendation  and  other
recommendations will follow.

The raising of awareness and popularising of the African Union mentioned  in
paragraph  2(a)  are  commendable  and  should  really  be  made   a   joint
responsibility  of  all  AU  members,  that  is,  African  parliaments.  The
parliamentary  delegations  to  these  interactive  meetings  should  be  as
inclusive and as representative as possible of diverse  views  and  opinions
that  are  prevalent,  yet  always  striving  for  consensus  to  facilitate
ultimate unity in action and implementation.

Africa is still very  fragmented  in  many  respects.  Without  in  any  way
wishing to nullify Africa's diversity or its beauty and splendour,  this  is
a hard fact for Africa to face. The second recommendation states that  there
is a need for interacting with other African parliaments  and  parliamentary
formations, including the SADC parliamentary  forum.  This  seems  to  be  a
reasonable proposition. However, fiscal implications  should  be  considered
carefully.  Countries  can  ill  afford  unending  meetings,  jamborees  and
talkshops when poverty-stricken  citizens  continue  to  starve  and  buckle
under the heavy yoke of poverty, some of it self-inflicted  by  shortsighted
economic policies and practices.

Paragraph 2(b)(i) states that the ratification of  the  protocol  should  by
now have been accomplished. The meeting of African parliaments tried  to  do
that  in  Cape  Town  recently.  We  must  allude  to  this  in   terms   of
representative participation. Here I cite the delegation from Lesotho  which
fully and fairly represented all parties in Lesotho, the  ruling  party,  as
well as minority and opposition parties, for the  simple  reason  that  this
kind of equity and justice binds all views people may have to  the  ultimate
outcome of  deliberations.  Marginalising  others  is  actually  creating  a
problem with regard to implementation and  outcomes.  This  must  always  be
borne in mind when we want to  do  things  together  on  our  march  to  the
establishment of a Pan-African Parliament, which is  no  easy  task  as  the
acronym PAP may suggest to many others.

Paragraph  2(b)(ii)  states  that  we  also  need  to   consider   financial
implications. Spending in faith is not always desirable. We should  remember
the poor, the sick, the disabled and the disadvantaged citizens in  all  our
efforts. The economic health and social  problems  will  not  be  solved  by
words or rhetoric from summits and seminars.

Having said that, this does  not  discount  dialogue  and  interaction,  nor
frugality and efficient systems and  practices  that  are  imperatives  that
Africa must constantly uphold and strive for.

The third recommendation does  not  prescribe,  but  rightly  proposes.  The
National Assembly must apply its mind to this.
In conclusion,  I  wish  to  point  out  that  the  following  concepts  and
initiatives related to the African Union should be  looked  at  closely  and
put under scrutiny: political  governance,  economic  corporate  governance,
human rights and the rule of law, and monitoring and evaluating the  AU  and
Nepad. The core themes must be  looked  at  constantly.  Peer  group  review
mechanisms should not be avoided, but vigorously explored, put in place  and
implemented unflinchingly without fear or favour.

Maverick states must be checked and chastised  in  some  corrective  manner.
Whilst respecting the sovereignty of member  states,  there  is  a  need  to
understand and accept that human rights are indivisible, and no  nation  can
live and conduct itself in total isolation  of  its  neighbours.  Zimbabwean
blunders in  dealing  with  legitimate  concerns  do  impact  negatively  on
neighbours, despite the sovereignty notion. Mutually benefiting  peer  group
review mechanisms should not be cynically and  maliciously  misconstrued  as
the bellicose wish to overrun or topple neighbours.
Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the  IFP  to  support  the
fifth report of the Working Group on the African Union. Even  in  doing  so,
may I, on behalf of all of my colleagues  in  the  House  here,  commiserate
with the hon Joe Seremane on the sad losses and  the  bereavement  that  his
immediate and extended family have experienced, as well  as  in  respect  of
the ill health that his wife is suffering. Joe,  our  best  wishes  go  with
you.

Having said that, may I then say how beholden I am to both Mr  Seremane  and
the Deputy Speaker for laying out in front of  members  the  work  that  has
been done by the committee in respect of advancing the aims of  the  African
Union.

The injunction today holds that we should think globally  and  act  locally.
Likewise, we should be thinking continentally and also  acting  locally.  We
need to do this because throughout the world the need to achieve an  economy
of scale has become imperative. If we see what has  happened  recently  with
the referendum in Ireland, the clear message is  that  the  markets  of  the
world are expanding.
Now, if we think of the Asian markets, India and China  and  Malaysia,  they
make up virtually half of humanity. Their market is virtually  a  market  of
about three billion people, and if we look at the European Union now, it  is
in a position where very soon  the  euro  will  be  able  to  challenge  the
supremacy of the dollar. That is how strong the European market has become.

As for us in South Africa, just 12 years ago  we  were  battling  to  put  a
parliament of all the people of this country together, and eight years  down
the road our challenge is not only to advance the cause of this  Parliament,
but, at the same time, to begin to argue for the  establishment  of  a  Pan-
African Parliament. We need to do this in order that we can meet  the  push-
pull principle that operates in the economies of the world.

South Africa, for example, is an economy that  is  being  pushed  by  global
requirements for greater competitiveness  and  better  quality,  and  as  we
begin to answer these questions of the push, if we make the  advances,  then
we also begin to pull the neighbouring economies  into  that  structure.  We
have to make certain that we have a pool of  skills,  the  capital  and  the
know-how to be able to compete effectively in the marketplace.

As we mentioned the other day when we were questioning the President,  South
Africa has to have a growth rate of at least 6%. A growth rate of  about  3%
will not be adequate to  remove  poverty,  hunger  and  joblessness  in  our
economy. We have to try to reach 6%, and I  submit  that  we  cannot  do  so
unless we begin to achieve economies of scale. And to  be  able  to  achieve
economies of scale, we have to look at Africa as the total market, a  market
of a little less than one billion people.

At the same time, as we hope to advance  politically  and  economically,  we
need to recognise that the African Union and  the  manner  in  which  it  is
structured  -  the  Deputy  Speaker  mentioned  this  -  present  a   unique
opportunity for Africa to advance human rights. Zimbabwe,  for  example,  at
the moment is not a role model. With  an  assault  on  civil  liberties  the
educators in Zimbabwe, the lawyers in Zimbabwe, the judges in  Zimbabwe  are
all being constrained. That can never  be  right,  and  that  can  never  be
healthy. And as Zimbabwe goes down economically, one of the big  markets  of
South Africa is going down economically. If Zimbabwe had been a vibrant  and
strong economy, our own growth rate would have been elevated.

It is in our interest, not only economically, but also from  a  humanitarian
point of view, to see that human rights advance. My colleague  Joe  Seremane
spoke about Nepad, the new opportunities for partnership, and  the  need  to
be  able  to  have  good  governance,  greater  accountability  and  greater
transparency in Africa as a  whole,  so  that  people  can  trade  with  one
another in such a manner that the economies of  all  the  African  countries
will grow.

This African Union will serve as a catalyst to ensure that these engines  of
growth will begin to produce the kind of growth we want.

I would like to look quickly at the Pan-African Parliament. The  Pan-African
Parliament will enable all of Africa, Africa's  leaders,  to  find  a  venue
where they can, on  a  sustained  basis,  have  dialogue  and  persuade  one
another. The Deputy Speaker emphasised the need  for  us,  collectively,  to
persuade one another to better practices, better ways of doing  things,  and
to growing the economies of all of our respective countries. If we  have  an
exchange of ideas and the opportunity to harmonise our  laws,  the  more  we
harmonise our laws, the better and easier it will become  for  us  to  trade
with one another.

We would also be able to advance along the route of IT, air  travel,  ground
travel, and all the  other  infrastructure  development  that  would  be  so
essential for Africa to  begin  to  exploit  its  potential.  Remember  that
Africa is extremely rich in natural  resources,  particularly  water,  which
will become a very crucial factor in 10 to 15 years' time.

With these resources, what is lacking is the psychological  element.  We  as
Africans do not think proudly of ourselves as  Africans;  we  do  not  think
positively of ourselves as Africans. We are more inclined to pull  ourselves
down and to degrade ourselves, rather than beginning to give  ourselves  the
chance that Africa has a right, that the African Renaissance is  a  reality,
that Nepad will deliver, that the African Union is not merely a  replica  of
the old organ, but that  it  is  entirely  new,  and  that  the  Pan-African
Parliament will be the cherry on the top.

We need to begin to reverse the way in which we have begun to see  ourselves
as Africans. Cape Town was the cradle of humanity, Cairo was the  cradle  of
civilisation, and if the cradle of humanity and the cradle  of  civilisation
come together, what is there that is not possible? We have had a 40  000  to
50 0000 years advance start on which we have not capitalised. Now comes  the
opportunity for us to do so, and particularly to advance the role  of  women
in Africa, because it is through women, who  are  less  combative  and  less
inclined to make war, that we stand the best chance  of  putting  Africa  on
the map. Forward, Africa!

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Speaker,  successful  regional  integration  programmes
have all had in common the fact that they have been driven by a  high  level
of political will. The European Union, which is widely seen as  one  of  the
most advanced regional integration projects of recent  history,  was  driven
by a strong political commitment in  continental  Western  European  states,
rooted in the  perception  that  economic  and  political  integration  were
essential to  create  new  realities  in  Europe  that  would  overcome  the
rivalries between various continental powers that had  torn  that  continent
apart in two world wars.

Conversely, a number of ambitious but often objectively  necessary  regional
integration programmes, particularly but not  only  in  developing  regions,
have faltered precisely because they have  received  mere  lip  service  and
have not been underpinned by any real substantive political commitment.  The
AU, or more precisely the transition from the OAU to the  AU,  was  inspired
by a very well-founded perception by the continent's leaders that there  was
a need for Africa to take a major step forward towards advancing  the  long-
cherished goal of building African unity to cope  with  the  new  challenges
posed by globalisation and the related threats of marginalisation.

The process which  we  know  as  globalisation  has  created  important  new
realities. It is associated with a major technological revolution, the  rise
of information and communication technology, of microelectronics and of ICT-
derived  knowledge  as  the  major  driving  force   of   productivity   and
accumulation.  Various  writers  have  compared  this  transition   to   the
Industrial Revolution of 18th and  19th  century  Europe  in  terms  of  its
significance for the organisation of  production,  and  the  development  of
productive forces in all branches and sectors of economic activity.  It  is,
of course, posing major new demands in terms of infrastructure  development,
particularly  in  the  telecommunications   area.   Nepad   highlights   the
challenges facing Africa in this regard when it notes that  there  are  only
918 mainline telephones per 1 000 people in Africa, compared to 146 for  the
world as a whole, and 567 for high-income countries.

Globalisation is also associated with a  massive  increase  in  cross-border
economic activity. At the same time, and inextricably  linked  to  the  very
same processes, it has  seen  widening  inequality  and  marginalisation  of
communities and previously existing productive activity, all underpinned  by
unfair trade rules and by inappropriate policy prescriptions.

The AU project and Nepad are both predicated on the recognition that  Africa
needs to act collectively to cope with these challenges. Nepad sets  a  goal
of achieving 7% growth and of halving  the  number  of  people  in  absolute
poverty on this continent by the year 2015. While Nepad  defines  an  agenda
of collective action within the continent, as well as between the  continent
and external partners to address  infrastructural  development,  to  promote
human resource development and to  advance  sectoral  programmes,  including
agriculture which is critical on this continent,  the  AU  Constitutive  Act
seeks to propel the continent further towards  building  both  socioeconomic
and political unity.

Success in advancing both the sectoral  and  infrastructural  objectives  of
Nepad and the more directly integrationist goals of the AU will need  to  be
underpinned by a firm political commitment. The programmes themselves,  both
the Nepad programmes and the AU integrationist programmes, will have  to  be
driven by a firm development-oriented political leadership. There will  also
have  to  be  political  commitment  to  acting  collectively  to   confront
challenges that no single country can successfully overcome.  The  political
will needed to drive the AU and Nepad programmes needs to be built not  just
at  the  level  of  heads  of  state  and  of  ministers,   executives   and
governments, but also at the level  of  parliaments  and  of  civil  society
constituencies.

It would have been very easy for us in this Parliament  to  have  approached
the issue of the AU with a burst of  activity  after  the  President's  call
which the Deputy Speaker referred to in her speech or  around  the  time  of
the Durban Summit, followed by a return to business as usual  in  which  the
question of African unity had only  a  marginal  place  in  our  daily  work
programmes. I believe that it is to the credit of  the  leadership  of  this
Parliament, and to yourself,  Madam  Speaker,  and  the  Deputy  Speaker  in
particular, that  you  have  recognised  that  there  is  a  need  for  this
Parliament to maintain the momentum of its work on the African Union.

One of the key recommendations in the report of the working group  which  is
before the House today, is that the Working Group on the African Union  must
continue its work, must continue to function  and  must  do  this  at  least
until work on the AU  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  routine  activities  of
portfolio committees and other structures of our Parliament.

There are a number of recommendations in this report which have  been  dealt
with by previous speakers and which will also be taken up  by  speakers  who
will follow me. I am going to confine my remarks to a few points which  were
made  in  the  working  group's  task  team  which  dealt  with  issues   of
socioeconomic integration and the involvement  of  civil  society.  Previous
reports of the working group have identified the  need  for  us  to  develop
further clarity and to take forward a debate on the  strategic  approach  to
building socioeconomic integration on the continent.

From the Constitutive Act and  the  Sirte  Declaration  and  other  founding
documents, it is  possible  to  discern  broad  agreement  and  guidance  on
certain general themes. These include a strong sense that there  is  a  need
to accelerate the process of building socioeconomic, as  well  as  political
integration, and also a view that regional bodies such Ecowas, SADC,  Comesa
and the Southern African Customs Union  are  important  building  blocks  to
broader continental integration. At this point I think we should  just  take
note of and welcome the fact that  a  new  Southern  African  Customs  Union
Agreement  was  signed  in  Gaborone  yesterday.  This  agreement  will   be
presented to this Parliament for ratification early next year. We will  have
an opportunity to discuss it in detail then. Then I think  today  we  should
just take note that this new SACU agreement provides for us in South  Africa
to act collectively with  our  partners  in  the  Customs  Union  in  taking
decisions on issues which  previously  were  the  exclusive  prerogative  of
South Africa. It marks  a  new  mode  of  decision-making,  a  new  mode  of
collective decision-making which I think will stand us in good stead in  our
broader endeavours on the African continent.

However, while the founding documents do give us a broad  indication  and  a
broad direction, there are many critical issues which are  not  yet  defined
in any detail. These include the relationship  between  the  infrastructure,
sectoral and social development programme of Nepad - now  the  programme  of
the AU - and  the  more  directly  integrationist  agenda  foreseen  in  the
Constitutive Act  and  the  Sirte  Declaration.  In  various  workshops  and
discussions in the working group on this topic, several of us have argued  -
and this has been a theme in earlier reports to this  House  as  well  -  in
favour of a developmental approach to promoting  socioeconomic  integration.
There  is  a  considerable  body  of  literature  which  has   argued   that
conventional trade integration approaches which  focus  on  removing  tariff
and regulatory barriers, and moving in linear  succession  from  free  trade
areas to customs unions and common markets and finally economic unions,  are
not necessarily the most appropriate in developing regions where  the  major
barriers to interregional trade are not necessarily tariffs or  regulations,
but underdeveloped production structures and inadequate infrastructure.

This is not to say that trade integration  issues  are  not  important,  but
rather that they have to be part of  a  wider  agenda  also  embracing  also
sectoral co-operation and strategic co-ordination,  in  which  developmental
considerations  inform  decisions  about  the  rates  and  pace   of   trade
integration. The problem is that, as the literature  on  integration  theory
tells us, a developmental approach  to  integration,  embracing  a  positive
agenda of co-operation and co-ordination, requires the building  of  a  high
level of political commitment and political will to drive it.

Mindful of some of these complexities  and  of  the  need  to  take  forward
debates on this issue, Parliament has commissioned a research team,  led  by
the  Human  Sciences  Research  Council  and  the   Africa   Institute,   to
investigate the approaches to and  experiences  of  subregional  integration
efforts on our  continent.  We  are  not  looking  to  a  mere  assembly  of
empirical facts, but rather to the highlighting of lessons  and  experiences
that can inform  a  strategic  and  conceptual  debate  on  the  appropriate
approach to  promoting  socioeconomic  integration  on  our  continent.  The
working  group  is  proposing  that  this  research  team  should  work   in
conjunction with the reference group composed of parliamentarians, and  that
the results of this research should be available both  to  inform  decisions
of executive structures and debates by  parliamentarians,  both  within  our
own country and across the continent. Hopefully, some of the results may  be
available at the time of the workshop early next year.
The other issue which the task team on socioeconomic  integration  concerned
itself with was the issue of civil  society  involvement  in  AU  processes.
Here we were not necessarily very profound.  We,  along  with  many  others,
noted that there is a certain amount  of  civil  society  apathy  around  AU
processes, and yet if unity has to be built,  it  is  critical  that  it  is
driven by processes that  reach  beyond  Government  officials,  to  embrace
formations of civil society. Indeed, I think we need to take account of  the
fact that there is already a  very  high  level  of  what  could  be  called
informal integration on our continent, which is, as we  know,  divided  into
countries by artificial boundaries imposed by colonialism that divided  pre-
existing communities.

People-to-people integration in West Africa and  Southern  Africa,  to  cite
just two regions, is already quite marked with unrecorded trade,  migration,
common cultures and languages reaching across national borders.  The  porous
borders that we often talk about need to be seen not just as a  threat,  but
also as an opportunity for taking integration processes further forward.  We
must find ways in our discussions on promoting integration to  draw  in  our
communities and involving them in  decisions  on  the  agendas  to  take  us
forward. The working  group's  recommendations  in  this  regard  are  quite
modest. Parliament can and should play a  role  in  interacting  with  civil
society formations in this  country  and  outside,  to  exchange  views  and
assist in promoting further dialogue on this question.

We are beginning an important journey. It is one that has the  potential  to
result in a major step forward to achieving the unity  that  has  long  been
recognised  as  essential  for  our  continent  to  address   the   critical
challenges facing us. If we rise to this challenge, we would  have  taken  a
major step towards achieving the goal of making the 21st century an  African
century. However, this will require hard work and continued engagement.  The
working group is recommending to this House that we  continue  to  make  our
contribution in this regard. [Applause.]

Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, belonging  to  the  Working  Group  on  the
African  Union  gives  one  the  opportunity  to  experience   participatory
democracy  functioning  in  a   self-evident,   almost   casual   manner   -
participatory in the sense that representatives of almost the  entire  South
African political spectrum are working  side  by  side,  jointly  doing  our
Parliament's share of developing the African Recovery Plan.

The undramatic tone of these deliberations  gives  the  lie  to  the  really
dramatic fact that in a continent chronically  riven  by  strife  and,  just
right next door, to the ongoing horror  on  our  border,  here  a  group  of
politically  diverse  parliamentarians  are  the  living  proof  that  peace
attends the adherence to the principles of a  constitutional  democracy.  It
is beginning to seem a long time ago now,  but  I  shall  never  forget  the
almost palpable disappointment of the mass media that South Africa  did  not
erupt in the violence  they  had  so  monotonously  and  perhaps  ignorantly
predicted for us when the result of the 1994 elections became known.  It  is
great to be a South African.

Afrika staan in die teken van transformasie. Die sekondêre  stryd  wat  deur
buitekontinentale magte oor hom afgebring is, was deel  van  'n  ongelukkige
fase van sy transformasie waarvan die nagevolge  nog  lank  nie  verwerk  is
nie. Deels was dit ook deur sy eie toedoen, en  die  volwassenheid  wat  nou
toenemend sigbaar word, kan gesien word in die wyse waarop daar hand in  eie
boesem gesteek word en eerlik gesoek word na oplossings.  Dit  lyk  soms  of
die publiek en die wêreld nog nie mooi begryp watter groot ding  daar  besig
is om hier te gebeur nie. As 'n mens so terugkyk  oor  die  geskiedenis  dan
wonder 'n mens hoe dit sou wees as die  ou  demokrasieë  in  die  genadelose
kollig van die openbare media  en  die  meedoënlose  blik  van  die  kykende
miljoene hul duisende jare van langsame ontwikkeling en bloedige  stryd  sou
moes voltrek.

Ons het die literêre nalatenskappe van die Odusseia en die Illias; ons  lees
in die geskiedenisboeke van Genghis Khan; ons lees  van  die  Visigote,  die
Vandale, die Vikinge, en dit is soos veraf verhale  -  iets  onwerkliks  wat
ons nie aangaan nie. Ons lees in die Bybel en in die  Koran  van  moord-  en
rooftogte, stryd en oorwinnings van duisende jare gelede  en  ons  voel  dit
nie aan ons vel nie. Afrika beskik nie oor hierdie luukse nie.

Ons moet die lang, tydsame pad van ons voorsate nou in die tegnologiese  eeu
aflê met die tyd wat op ons inteleskopeer, terwyl 'n nogal nie te  geduldige
wêreld soos 'n kritiese skoonma gereeld op ons pik. 'n  Skoonseun  is  nooit
volmaak nie, maar daar sal ver gesoek moet word om  'n  skoonseun  soos  mnr
Thabo Mbeki te kry - tekortkominge en al - want die lobola wat hy bring,  is
die Afrika-unie en Nepad, en die G8 het dit aanvaar en sy bruidskat  op  die
tafel gesit.  Ons  taak  is  om  die  transformasie  reg  te  laat  verloop.

[Africa bears the stamp  of  transformation.  The  secondary  struggle  that
external continental powers have brought down on it was in  fact  already  a
part  of  an  unfortunate  phase  of  its  transformation,  of   which   the
consequences have not by far been processed yet. It was also partly  due  to
its own doing, and the maturity that has  now  become  increasingly  visible
can be seen in the manner in which it is searching  its  own  heart  in  its
sincere search for solutions. At times it appears as if the public  and  the
world do not entirely understand the enormity of  that  which  is  happening
here. If one looks back on the history one wonders how it  would  have  been
if the old democracies were in the ruthless spotlight of  the  public  media
and the relentless glance of millions watching how they  had  to  carry  out
thousands of years of slow development and bloody struggle.

We have the literary legacy of the Odusseia and the Illias;  we  read  about
Genghis Khan in history books; we read about  the  Visigoths,  the  Vandals,
the Vikings, and it is like distant tales - something unreal that  does  not
concern us. We read in the Bible and in the Koran about murder and  robbery,
struggles and victories of thousands of years ago and we are not touched  by
it. Africa does not dispose of such luxury.
We must now travel the long and slow road of our forefathers in this age  of
technology, with time closing in on  us,  while  a  rather  impatient  world
invariably regularly carps at us like a critical  mother-in-law.  A  son-in-
law is never perfect, but you would have to look far and wide to find a son-
in-law like Mr Thabo Mbeki - in spite  of  his  shortcomings  -  because  he
brings the African Union and Nepad as lobola, and the G8 accepted  this  and
put his dowry on the table. Our task is to make the  transformation  proceed
smoothly.]

Wise and sensible leadership is required to undo  the  consequences  of  the
disastrous socialist policies of the Cold War period, which left  Africa  so
far behind the Oriental economies. They escaped  the  misfortune  of  having
leaders advised and educated by the socialist intellectuals of Albion.  They
escaped being infected by the second-hand indignation  transferred  to  them
from self-serving movements across the Atlantic  and  elsewhere.  They  also
largely  escaped   the   effects   of   reckless   revolutionary   promises.
Transformation has to deliver not only redistribution, but  also  accessible
and sustainably growing economies. Taking away the  farms  or  jobs  in  the
hands of productive minorities will not restore sub-Saharan Africa  to  what
it was before, among other things, the impulse of the Little Ice Age in  the
northern hemisphere sent scores of pioneers to warmer climes.

Mr Mbeki and his colleagues in many African states know this. We know  this.
As regional leader, our task is  to  assist  in  bringing  the  benefits  of
transformation to the peoples of Africa without  losing  or  destroying  the
human infrastructure and the administrative systems that implement  delivery
and, most importantly, where these do not exist, to grow and develop them.

Die begrip ``parlement'' stem nie oral in  Afrika  ooreen  nie.  In  heelwat
lande bestaan daar hoegenaamd  nie  so  iets  nie.  Dit  alleen  behoort  'n
aanduiding te gee van die taak wat Suid-Afrika, sy leierskap en  sy  vennote
in hierdie visie op hande het. Dis moeilik genoeg om 'n minister so  ver  te
kry om die insigte te deel  wat  parlementslede  soms  ontwikkel  weens  hul
blootstelling aan gewone  kiesers  of  rolspelers.  Oral  het  kabinette  en
uitvoerende gesag die neiging om parlemente te  gebruik  wanneer  dit  hulle
pas en notisie van hulle te neem as dit hul doelwitte dien.

Ons sal ons rol as toesighouer  oor  die  belange  van  die  publiek  en  as
wetgewers al baie beter kan speel as ons  administratief  meer  doeltreffend
kan funksioneer. Ook meer bystand per parlementslid sal ons  in  staat  stel
om onsself  beter  te  bemagtig  om  die  werksaamhede  van  ministeries  en
departemente te volg, ons kiesers by te staan en die publiek  te  betrek  by
besluitneming. Des te meer geld dit die  res  van  Afrika.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[All over Africa the  concept  ``parliament''  differs.  In  a  considerable
number of countries nothing of the sort exists. This alone  should  give  an
indication of the task at hand for South  Africa,  its  leadership  and  its
partners in this vision. It is difficult enough to get a minister  to  share
the insights that members of  parliament  develop  at  times  due  to  their
exposure to ordinary voters or role-players. Cabinets and  executive  powers
all over have the tendency to use parliaments whenever it suits them and  to
take notice of them if they serve their objectives.

We would already be able to play a  better  role  as  the  overseer  of  the
public's interests and as legislators if we could function more  effectively
with regard to administrative functions. More support  for  each  member  of
Parliament will also enable us to  empower  ourselves  more  to  pursue  the
activities of Ministries and departments, to support voters and  to  involve
the public in decision-making. This applies even to a greater degree to  the
rest of Africa.]

The role of Parliament in curbing the misuse of power by the  executive  and
the state cannot  be  overstated.  Existing  parliaments  need  to  be  more
proactive in promoting participation in an open democratic culture in  their
respective countries and in realising the objectives of the AU and Nepad.
The New NP would like to move that the fifth report of the AU working  group
be adopted by Parliament. [Applause.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the UDM I  wish  to  convey  our
deepest sympathies to hon Seremane for the tragic loss of his  son  and  the
passing on of his relative. May they rest in peace.

The African Union has been launched and a task team has  been  charged  with
deliberating on the functioning of its priority organs.  It  is  hoped  that
the establishment of the Pan-African  Parliament  will  put  Africa  on  the
course of building African unity and the realisation of  the  African  dream
of a peaceful, productive, prosperous and an independent continent that  can
interact with others as an equal on the global stage.

This is a great ideal, and all Africans ought to  pool  their  energies  and
resources to realise it. However, we must be realistic  and  recognise  that
this will be a long and arduous road. We are a  deeply  fractured  continent
as a consequence of  our  history.  While  we  should  not  dwell  on  these
weaknesses, we need to put them into  perspective  when  we  chart  the  way
forward. Our  acknowledgement  of  the  difficulties  we  encounter  on  the
African terrain will inform the tactics and strategies that  we  will  adopt
from time to time.

We need to deal meaningfully and effectively with Africa's internecine  wars
which deplete our human, natural and economic resources.  We  have  to  stop
the plundering of our economic resources by rapacious  international  giants
which  are  driven  by  a  profit  motive  and  relegate   the   continental
developmental needs to the background.

There is an imperative to reduce economic dependence on the North. Nepad  is
intended to bring  about  this  objective.  It  is,  however,  important  to
realise that the responsibility to drive this process is in Africa's  hands,
rather than in the hands of the developed North. Africa is drawn in  colour.
We are a multicultured community with  a  diverse  history  of  slavery  and
colonialisation. Therefore our levels of development are varied and  uneven.
As a consequence of this, we have evolved or had  imposed  on  us  different
and sometimes conflicting  political  institutions.  In  applying  the  peer
review mechanism of the AU, we  must  constantly  bear  this  in  mind  when
evaluating adherence by member states to the principles of the  AU.  No  one
country can afford to be seen to be prescribing to its peers.

The parliamentary institution, as we know it, is  a  borrowed  concept  from
our former colonisers. It can be put to good use and yield  worthy  results.
There may be others who would argue  that  they  have  developed  their  own
unique institutions from their peculiar social and  cultural  circumstances.
It would not be wise to use value judgments in appraising such  deliberative
organs. There must be a way by which we can march in step and arrive at  our
ultimate goal, notwithstanding our great diversity. We support this report.

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, I would like to commend  our  Parliament  for
not only establishing the Working Group on the African Union,  but  for  the
work done so far. I believe that we as a country must forge ahead with  this
process, as most nations are looking to us not only to  lead,  but  also  to
show the way.

It is of great concern, however, that the transition from the OAU to the  AU
is still in a shambles. There is still no clarity as  to  the  retention  of
personnel or otherwise. We appeal to  the  commission  of  the  AU  to  work
towards resolving this issue.

It is also of great concern that there is  no  indication  yet  whether  the
protocol establishing the Pan-African Parliament  is  now  ratified  by  the
requisite number of member states of the AU. The delay in  the  coming  into
existence of the Pan-African Parliament means the dream of  our  peoples  to
have  a  common  platform  and  actively  participate   in   decision-making
regarding the challenges facing the continent will remain but a  dream.  The
culture of democracy, good governance, respect for human  rights,  the  rule
of law and the strengthening of  democratic  institutions  will  remain  ink
written on paper if the Pan-African Parliament is not established.

Lastly, there is an immediate need to co-ordinate all the activities of  the
AU and its organs. The growing dichotomy between the AU  process  and  Nepad
is a cause for concern. We appeal to those involved  to  work  together  and
amalgamate their activities. We support the recommendations of the report.

Ms S C VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, in considering this report  of  the  AU
working group, I would like to address a few points on  the  importance  and
the necessity of our involvement as a parliament and as  a  country  in  the
unfolding development of the African Union and its organs.

The African Union, like the OAU before it, is set  in  a  specific  time  in
history. When the OAU was formed in  Addis  Ababa  in  1963,  its  task  was
broadly to mobilise  the  states  of  Africa  to  free  the  continent  from
colonial rule and apartheid.  The  OAU  was  successful  in  achieving  this
objective and now, at the start of the 21st century, the challenge  for  the
new African Union is the economic  development  of  the  continent  and  the
eradication of poverty.

This project requires a unity of purpose amongst the  countries  of  Africa.
It requires the same single-mindedness that the countries of  the  continent
showed in liberating Africa from colonial occupation. At the launch  of  the
African Union in July, our President made a call to us as South Africans  to
build that unity of purpose. He said:


  The first task is to achieve unity,  solidarity,  cohesion,  co-operation
  among the peoples of Africa and African states. We  must  build  all  the
  institutions  necessary  to  deepen  political,   economic   and   social
  integration of the African continent.  We  must  deepen  the  culture  of
  collective action in Africa and in our relations with  the  rest  of  the
  world.

The African Union thus provides us with the instrument with which  to  focus
on this integration of Africa with the institutions of  the  African  Union,
and the New Partnership for Africa's Development is the vehicle for action.

Members will know that the African heads of state  have  endorsed  Nepad  as
the development framework for the African Union.  In  doing  so,  they  have
affirmed their commitment  to  the  promotion  of  democracy  and  its  core
values.  They  have   committed   themselves   to   working   with   renewed
determination according to agreed principles, including  the  rule  of  law,
the equality of all citizens  before  the  law,  individual  and  collective
freedoms,  equality  of  opportunity  for  all,  the  inalienable  right  to
participate in the election of their leaders, adherence  to  the  separation
of powers, and others.

In this context, the Nepad steering committee has been working on the  codes
and standards and indicators for good  governance  on  the  continent.  Next
month, the Nepad heads  of  state  implementation  committee  will  meet  in
Nigeria to finalise the terms of the declaration of what  has  become  known
as  the  declaration  on  democracy,  political,  economic   and   corporate
governance.
The declaration will be supported by the now well-known African peer  review
mechanism, and is aimed at enhancing African ownership  of  its  development
agenda through a system of self-assessment that ensures  that  the  policies
of African countries are based on best current knowledge and  practice.  The
African peer review  mechanism  is  essentially  an  instrument  voluntarily
acceded to by member states  of  the  African  Union  as  an  African  self-
monitoring mechanism. Its  mandate  is  to  ensure  that  the  policies  and
practices of the participating  states  conform  to  the  agreed  political,
economic and corporate governance values, codes and standards that  will  be
contained in the declaration.

Once the implementation committee has met and finalised the contents of  the
declaration, participation in the process will be open to all member  states
of the African Union. Countries wishing to participate in  the  peer  review
mechanism will notify the chairman of the  Nepad  implementation  committee,
and this will entail an undertaking to submit to periodic peer  reviews,  as
well as to facilitate such reviews and be guided by  agreed  parameters  for
good political governance, and good economic  and  corporate  governance  as
well.

It is proposed that the peer review mechanism will be directed  and  managed
by a panel of between five and seven eminent persons.  The  members  of  the
panel must be Africans who have distinguished  themselves  in  careers  that
are relevant to the work of the peer  review  mechanism  and,  in  addition,
members of the panel must be persons of high moral stature  and  demonstrate
commitment to the ideals of Pan-Africanism.

The  declaration  and  the  peer  review  mechanism  are  not  intended   as
instruments of punishment, but are instruments for development. Their  words
and their intentions will say that if we  as  a  country  subscribe  to  the
terms and objectives of the declaration and submit ourselves  to  review  by
our peers, then we will benefit. If we do not, we exclude ourselves.  It  is
as simple as that.

Which country would decide to exclude itself from the benefits of  a  better
Africa, a programme of development for her people and  a  united  bargaining
tool for better trade access and development aid? There  is  no  punishment,
therefore, through subscribing to the declaration and applying standards  of
good governance, only self-banishment from the benefits  of  Nepad,  if  one
does not.

In many ways, Nepad programmes are already underway in forums all  over  the
continent. For  example,  there  was  the  meeting,  this  past  weekend  in
Johannesburg,  of  the  finance  Ministers  from  all  over  the  continent.
Ministers were united at this occasion  in  urging  the  continent  to  move
quickly  to  finalise  the  peer  review  mechanism  and  show  progress  in
implementing it. In fact, both Ghana  and  Uganda  have  already  made  know
their intention to participate in the peer review mechanism.

The Africa Institute in Pretoria has gathered African academics together  to
discuss ways for them to popularise the African Union and  Nepad  programmes
through  the  various  institutions  they  represent.  Members   from   this
Parliament  are  engaged  in  multilateral  parliamentary  forums   on   the
continent to build alliances and share information. In fact,  our  President
himself is  in  Algeria  today,  meeting  with  the  South  African-Algerian
Binational Commission.

It is important that we remember that Nepad is a  partnership,  and  central
to the Nepad vision  is  the  building  and  sustaining  of  a  genuine  and
constructive partnership between  African  states  at  one  level,  and  the
developed world at another. This involves harnessing the political  will  of
the African leaders, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, to  drive  the
initiative by building strong African institutions, expertise  and  capacity
through partnerships premised on mutual benefit.

The G8 countries have  entered  into  this  partnership  with  us  and  have
committed themselves to a plan of action on  Nepad.  The  finance  Ministers
meeting in Johannesburg, which I referred to earlier, raised  the  important
point in the partnership equation, and that is  the  equal  responsibilities
of our partners in developed countries.

In reviewing our African partners through  the  peer  review  mechanism,  it
should also be possible to review commitments made by our other partners  in
the developed world to monitor aid and trade. For example,  to  what  degree
have they fulfilled the commitments they have made? To what extent  do  they
allow African countries ownership of their own programmes?  To  what  degree
do aid commitments come with strings attached? Then,  of  course,  there  is
the burning question of access for African countries  to  developed  country
markets.

These will not be easy issues, but for our part, self-monitoring will  be  a
central part of our  accountability  to  our  partners.  For  our  developed
country partners, the key commitment will be to  ensure  that  all  policies
affecting African development are consistent  with  our  mutual  development
goals, including market access and issues of debt and so on.

There are those who are sceptical about  Nepad  and  whether  it  will  work
where other international  initiatives  have  failed.  Nepad  is  the  first
African-driven initiative. Our greatest incentive, therefore, is to make  it
work.

These are our projects, and we must work in our communities, in  our  unique
and creative ways, to make this a broad programme for all  our  people,  and
we must succeed.

We in the ANC support  the  recommendations  of  the  fifth  report  of  the
working group that the work is not complete,  that  we  must  continue  with
this work, and that we must enthusiastically take  up  the  challenges  that
the AU faces. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, before I call on the next speaker, I  would
like to acknowledge members of the Zambian parliament who are  visiting  and
are looking particularly at the work done  in  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Health. Welcome, hon members. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mev die Speaker, tydens die Koue Oorlog het Afrika  en  die
Organisasie vir Onverbonde Lande 'n  baie  belangrike  rol  gespeel  in  die
balans tussen die Weste aan die een kant en die Oosblok-lande aan die  ander
kant.

Met die val van die Berlynse Muur, en met die opbreek van  die  Sowjet-unie,
het hierdie internasionale magsbalans totaal en  permanent  verskuif  en  is
Afrika se rol geminimaliseer. Die nuwe magsblokke lê hoofsaaklik in  Amerika
aan die een kant, en Europa in die ooste, met die  ou  Oosbloklande  wat  'n
mindere rol speel en Afrika wat totaal eintlik geïgnoreer word.

Teen hierdie  agtergrond  het  die  VF  die  stigting  van  die  Afrika-unie
gesteun. Ons dink dit is belangrik. Dit  is  belangrik  dat  Afrika  homself
red, want die res van die wêreld sien dit nie as  'n  prioriteit  sover  dit
hulle aangaan nie. Maar ons  het  wel  voorwaardes  gestel  en  ons  is  ook
bekommerd oor sekere sake. Een van die sake waaroor  ons  bekommerd  is,  is
byvoorbeeld die Afrika-unie se strukture. Die Afrika-unie  se  strukture  is
tot 'n groot mate dieselfde as die  Europese  Unie  se  strukture;  daar  is
sekere oorvleuelings na albei kante toe. 'n Belangrike verskil is egter  dat
in Europa se geval die Europese  Unie  met  slegs  enkele  lede  begin  het.
Daarvandaan is die Europese Unie uitgebrei deur nuwe lede by te kry wat  aan
sekere vereistes voldoen het, en wat dan gemaak het  dat  hulle  lidmaatskap
verdien. Eintlik presteer hulle om dit dan te kan verdien.

In Afrika se geval is alle Afrika-lande dadelik lede  van  die  Afrika-unie.
Die risiko hieraan verbonde  is  dat  enkele  lande  wat  dwarstrek  of  wat
probleme veroorsaak, die hele AU se geloofwaardig en sukses  kan  vernietig.
Ek kan aan  Mugabe  en  Zimbabwe  dink.  Ek  kan  aan  Libië  dink,  en  nog
voorbeelde.

Omdat Afrika-state hulle nie in die  Afrika-unie  hoef  ``in  te  presteer''
nie,  soos  met  Europese  lande  die  geval  is,  is  die   ``peer   review
mechanism'', die  oorsigmeganisme,  wat  my  betref  baie  belangrik  om  te
verhoed dat die Afrika-unie as 'n nuwe inisiatief dalk misluk. Ek  dink  die
gebeure in verskillende lande in Afrika bevestig dit, ook die Ivoorkus  nou.
Daarom is dit vir ons uiters belangrik dat hierdie meganisme moet werk.  Dit
is nog nie vir ons duidelik presies hoe dit aangepak gaan word nie, maar  as
die Afrika-unie en Nepad misluk, dink ons nie Afrika  gaan  'n  tweede  kans
kry nie; dit mag ons  laaste  kans  wees  om  'n  sukses  te  maak  hiervan.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, Africa and the Non-aligned Movement  played
a very important role during the Cold War in the balance  between  the  West
on the one hand and the Eastern bloc countries on the other.

The international power balance shifted totally  and  permanently  with  the
fall of the Berlin Wall and  the  breaking  up  of  the  Soviet  Union,  and
Africa's role was minimalised. The new power blocks lie  mainly  in  America
on the one hand and Europe to the east; with the old Eastern bloc  countries
playing a lesser role, and Africa which is in fact totally ignored.

It is against this background that the FF has  supported  the  establishment
of the African Union. We think that it is important. It  is  important  that
Africa saves herself, because the rest of the world, as far as  it  concerns
them, does not see this as  a  priority.  However,  we  have  certainly  set
conditions and we are also  concerned  about  certain  issues.  One  of  the
issues that concerns us, for example,  is  the  structures  of  the  African
Union. The structures of the African Union are to a great extent similar  to
the structures of the European Union;  there  are  certain  overlappings  to
both sides. However, an important difference is that in the case  of  Europe
the European Union started with only a few members. The European Union  then
expanded by acquiring new members who complied  with  certain  requirements,
which had them earn their membership. In fact, they  achieved  in  order  to
deserve it.

In the case of Africa, all African countries became members of  the  African
Union immediately. The risk here is  that  one  or  two  countries  who  are
recalcitrant or cause problems could destroy the credibility and success  of
the AU. I can think of Mugabe and Zimbabwe. I can think of Libya,  and  more
examples.

Because African states do not have to achieve in  order  to  belong  to  the
African Union, as is the case  with  European  countries,  the  peer  review
mechanism, the overseeing mechanism, as far  as  I  am  concerned,  is  very
important to prevent the possible failure of the  African  Union  as  a  new
initiative. I think the events in various countries in Africa confirm  this,
as now in the Ivory Coast. It is therefore very important to  us  that  this
mechanism should work. It is not yet clear to us  exactly  how  it  will  be
tackled. We do not think that  Africa  will  get  a  second  chance  if  the
African Union and Nepad fail; it may be our last chance to  make  a  success
of this.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members,  the  decision  on  11  July
2000 by the 53 heads of state and governments on the  African  continent  to
adopt the Constitutive Act of the African Union has to be hailed as a  major
step in bringing Africans closer to one another.
That the African Union  was  established  in  South  Africa  with  pomp  and
fanfare earlier this year, makes it even more significant  for  us.  The  40
objectives of the AU are  a  clear  indication  that  the  body  is  set  to
ameliorate living conditions of all people on  the  continent,  and  we  all
have to strive towards realising that. In summary,  the  objectives  clearly
point out that we all have to be our brothers' keepers. We are  indebted  to
the Speaker of this House for the passion she has  for  the  African  Union.
May we, in the same breath, keep in mind the  unanimous  acceptance  of  the
motion she passed in this House, calling for the Pan-African  Parliament  to
be based in South Africa. That has to be realised.

We depend greatly on the  strength  of  our  colleagues  who  serve  on  the
Working Group on the African Union to work tirelessly  on  the  project.  We
hope our representatives at the  recent  IPU  council,  which  was  held  in
Geneva in September, have put across the feelings of South Africans  on  the
AU.

We believe, in keeping with the recommendation of  the  meeting  of  African
parliaments, held  in  this  Chamber  in  June  this  year,  that  the  SADC
parliamentary group has actively set up a representative steering  committee
of parliamentarians to champion the cause of  establishing  the  Pan-African
Parliament. We concur that to keep Africans across the continent abreast  of
developments around the African Union, parliaments should hold workshops  to
educate the people on what  the  African  Union  is  and  what  it  aims  to
achieve. The UCDP is in total support of  working  towards  the  realisation
that, as Africans, re ka kgona [we can].

Dr S E M  PHEKO:  Madam  Speaker,  the  PAC  supports  the  5th  report  and
recommendations of the Working Group on the African Union.  The  ravages  of
slavery  and  colonialism  sent  Africa  into  the  abyss  of  unprecedented
inhumanity and humiliation. What can  be  done  to  restore  Africa  to  her
former power and glory must be done speedily and wisely.

Africa cannot be an economic slave of other nations for  ever.  The  PAC  is
therefore interested in the African Union as a finished product which  shall
serve the best interests of the continent's people, especially  economically
and technologically. We want to say loud and clear that  the  African  Union
must create a world of interdependence in which Africa is an equal partner.

Africa has resources. These resources  must  benefit  her  people  more  and
develop this continent. Africa is reputed to  have  80%  of  raw  materials,
compared with Europe's 20%. There  is  no  need  for  Africa  to  go  to  G8
countries, cap in hand. The G8 countries benefit from the raw  materials  of
this continent which, by the way, must be  exported  from  Africa  to  those
countries as finished products.

The African Union must insist on  the  cancellation  of  Africa's  so-called
debts,  because  it  is  Africa  that  is  owed  trillions  of  dollars   in
reparations for  slave  trade  and  colonialism.  Nepad  must  be  a  strong
economic arm of the African Union and Africa must look to herself more  than
to external forces. Self-reliance is the best policy.

Finally, I want to say that it seems that Nepad will be separated  from  the
African Union. For instance, Nepad will not be set up in  Addis  Ababa,  but
in Pretoria, where it will remain a  separate,  independent  unit.  However,
allow me to conclude by saying that the African Union is the  greatest  pan-
African vision for our continent. It is a vision that must  succeed.  As  Dr
Kwame Nkrumah put it a long time ago: ``I have been accused  of  pursuing  a
policy of the impossible, but I  cannot  believe  in  the  impossibility  of
achieving African  union  more  than  I  could  ever  have  thought  of  the
impossibility of attaining African freedom.''

Africa must unite. We  have  before  us  not  only  an  opportunity,  but  a
historic duty.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF expresses its satisfaction  with  the
work produced by the Working Group on the African  Union  and  supports  the
5th report of the working group.
The recommendations made by the working group on  the  Constitutive  Act  of
the AU were found to be valid. The involvement of civil  society  is  needed
so as not only to allow for a broader spectrum of input on issues, but  also
to allow for our citizenry's participation as a  constitutional  right.  The
suggestion to involve the NCOP is thought to be of importance and linked  in
a similar way to the involvement of civil society.

The MF feels that this may be expanded to even further levels of  governance
so as  to  establish  a  level  of  involvement  of  the  three  spheres  of
government. The MF further agrees  that  it  is  important  that  Parliament
maintains  a  hands-on  strategy  throughout   the   entire   process.   The
establishment of the AU is extremely important. The world  is  watching  and
what we do and how we do it will determine the status it attains globally.

It is agreed that South Africa should  not  have  an  arrogant,  know-it-all
approach to this. It is important for us to note that  even  though  we  are
often praised for our achievements, we do still have  a  lot  to  learn.  We
have borrowed a lot from the Western  world.  How  much  does  the  rest  of
Africa respect that? As with any native culture, it is felt  that  a  degree
of culture needs to be respected and upheld.

The MF acknowledges time constraints, but regards it as very important  that
we should not entertain slapdash methods, but that we should put a  body  in
place that in the long run will not be the victim of much criticism.

The MF feels that a study should be conducted among the countries that  form
part of the AU and, instead of implementing the South  African  way  as  the
only way, perhaps we could reach a  compromise  between  member  states  and
establish a body to represent South Africa, not produce  a  carbon  copy  of
South Africa. There are many of loopholes in our system and there  are  many
African tactics and systems that we all could learn from.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, in his  answer  to  a  question  from  the  AEB,
President Mbeki said in this House two  months  ago  that  the  question  of
recognising diversity and promoting the rights of cultural,  linguistic  and
religious communities was an important one for the success  of  the  African
Union.

At the moment, however, the Constitutive Act of the African Union  does  not
reflect these sentiments and promises of the President.  The  AEB  asks  the
question: When, how and to what extent will this principle be made  part  of
the Constitutive Act and how will it be implemented in practice?

There is a danger that  the  African  Union,  the  African  Renaissance  and
African development could be perceived and  practised  as  a  sort  of  pan-
Africanism. Because of the legacy of  colonialism,  too  often  rhetoric  is
heard of ``Africans'' and ``foreigners'', ``real  Africans''  and  ``second-
hand latecomers''. The AEB is of the opinion that there is a big  difference
between African loyalty and Africanism.

Anton Lembede het in 1946 reeds Afrika slegs vir Afrikane opgeëis. Alle nie-
Afrikane, uitlanders, Asiërs en Europeërs is as indringers beskou  wat  geen
beduidende  bydrae  kon  lewer  tot  die  nasionale   ontwaking,   nasionale
renaissance of wedergeboorte - sy woorde destyds al -  wat  onvermydelik  op
Afrika wag nie.

Hy wou Afrikane in 'n homogene nasie  saamsnoer,  gelei  deur  'n  nasionale
beweging waarvan alle Afrikane lede moes  wees  en  alle  nie-Afrikanistiese
erfenisse geminag word. So het Afrikanisme 'n nasionale beweging behels  wat
raseksklusief   rakende   lidmaatskap   en   leierskap   moet   wees,   maar
allesomvattend met betrekking tot die reikwydte van sy magstryd.

Verder is daar nie net  geen  nie-Afrika  opposisie  geduld  nie,  maar  ook
totale eenstemmigheid vereis onder  Afrikane,  wat  nie  slegs  beteken  dat
begrippe soos veelparty-demokrasie en veelvolkigheid taboe is nie, maar  dat
onderlinge leiersverskille tussen Afrikane ook 'n verbode gedagte is.

Dit kan die Achilleshiel van die Afrika-unie word. Ons  sien  dit  reeds  in
die tipe  solidariteit  rondom  mnr  Mugabe.  Dit  is  noodsaaklik  dat  die
beginsels van demokrasie en tussengroepsverdraagsaamheid,  wat  uitgaan  van
die beginsel dat Afrika aan al  sy  mense  behoort,  duidelik  verdiskonteer
word in die ``Constitutive Act''  en  die  toekomstige  handelinge  van  die
Afrika-unie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Anton Lambede as long ago as 1946 claimed Africa  for  Africans.  All  non-
Africans, foreigners, Asians and Europeans were  regarded  as  invaders  who
could  not  make  a  meaningful  contribution  to  the  national  awakening,
national renaissance or rebirth of the nation - these were  his  words  then
already - which inevitably awaited Africa.

He wanted to join Africans in one homogeneous  nation,  led  by  a  national
movement to which all Africans must belong  and  all  non-African  heritages
must be despised. So Africanism entailed a national movement  which  had  to
be racially exclusive in terms of membership and  leadership,  but  entirely
comprehensive in terms of the range of its power struggle.

Furthermore, not only was non-African opposition not tolerated at  all,  but
total unanimity amongst Africans was demanded, which  not  only  means  that
terms like multiparty democracy and multinationality were  taboo,  but  that
mutual leadership differences among Africans were also a forbidden idea.

This can become the Achilles heel of the  African  Union.  We  have  already
seen this in the type of solidarity concerning Mr Mugabe. It  is  imperative
that the principles of democracy and inter-group tolerance, which holds  the
principle that Africa belongs to all its people,  are  clearly  incorporated
in the Constitutive Act and the future actions of the African Union.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, whilst we are debating the fifth  report
of the Working Group on the African Union,  it  is  pleasing  to  note  that
African leaders are beginning to  agree  on  the  need  to  consolidate  the
resources within the African Union in order to advance the  affairs  of  the
continent. For too long Africa has depended on others for  its  development,
with the result that its own economic and industrial power has been  eroded.
It is indeed now  the  time  to  build  a  common  economic  objective.  For
example, our communications were devised under colonial rule to  communicate
with Europe and elsewhere, instead of between our states, cities  and  areas
in rural Africa.

Azapo accepts that the unity of Africa is a process, and the events  of  the
past six months have indeed convinced us that the African Union is  here  to
stay. Political unity, accompanied by economic unity,  should  give  us  the
power and the will to change the circumstances under which the poor live  in
Africa. We in Africa have vast mineral, agricultural  and  water  resources.
These important resources can  be  fully  exploited  and  utilised  for  the
common good of all Africans.

Azapo has learnt with disappointment that some  African  states  reject  the
concept of a common army for the maintenance of peace. We  do  not  see  any
wisdom in rejecting this concept because we believe that  there  is  nothing
wrong in maintaining a military force for self-defence  and  the  protection
of African states.

With the advent of American imperialism, if  we  do  not  build  a  military
force to defend the African Union in one way or another,  individual  states
in Africa that may be  targeted  for  attack  by  this  imperialist  out  of
insecurity may find themselves abandoning the African Union.

Azapo accepts this report and supports the recommendations.

Mr D J SITHOLE: Madam Speaker, the establishment of the  African  Union  was
the continuation of the statement made 39 years ago by the  African  leaders
who met at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and founded the  OAU.  Their  actions  were
informed by a determination to define Africa not  as  individual  countries,
but as a collective bound together by geography, history and destiny.
It was the unity of our people, not defined by colour, religion or  colonial
language, which  informed  their  endeavours  to  free  the  continent  from
colonialism  and  construct  a  society  at  peace  and  free  from  foreign
domination and bondage. It was  the  OAU  and  the  people  of  Africa  who,
through their efforts and conviction, led the world to declare  apartheid  a
crime against humanity.

They  are  today  committing  themselves  to  a  fight  to  establish  peace
throughout the continent by ending all conflicts through negotiations  based
on the principle of justice and peace for all. The  unwavering  support  and
increased involvement of the people of Africa in  the  struggle  for  peace,
development and the reconstruction of the continent will  ensure  that  even
those who have lost hope will  again  realise  that  we  are  determined  to
succeed.

We must admit  that  there  are  difficult  challenges  ahead  and  we  must
confront  them.  One  of  the  immediate  difficulties  is  the  fact   that
postcolonial states, as inherited from the colonial period,  remain  largely
untransformed. These states are used as an  instrument  for  self-enrichment
by sections of the continent's political elite, rather than for  creating  a
better life for all. It is this self-enrichment mentality that  has  created
most of the conflicts on the continent.

The African Union presents a turning point in the history of  the  continent
and is encouraging creative thinking and approaches in resolving  conflicts.
It has placed before us the agenda for  development.  The  challenge  is  to
transform the African postcolonial states, to liberate them from  the  greed
of the political elite and to reorientate them towards serving the needs  of
the people. The continent must rid itself  of  the  people  who  always  see
danger in changes and transformation, for  they  want  to  protect  the  old
system that has benefited them.

Society is in constant motion and our ability to understand the changes  and
prevailing new conditions will determine our success. Change is a  permanent
feature of society. Those who fail  to  recognise  that  the  world  is  not
static will always criticise those who  embrace  change  and  want  to  move
forward.

Change presents new conditions and challenges,  but  it  is  those  who  are
inspired by revolutionary theory who  will  enter  the  battlefield  without
assumed or preconcieved ideas, but  armed  with  the  correct  understanding
that what is needed is to succeed.

The successful launch of the African Union in Durban was indeed one  of  the
continent's biggest achievements. Amongst the decisions taken at the  summit
is the establishment of a one-year interim period  with  the  African  Union
affairs managed by an interim commission, as well as  the  adoption  of  the
protocol on the establishment of a peace security council as an  organ  that
will enable the union to deal with issues of peace and  security  which  may
intervene in the affairs of member states as and when necessary.

The assembly declared that the next 10 years, starting  from  this  year  to
2011, will be  a  decade  for  capacity-building  in  Africa.  The  assembly
committed African leaders to the speedy  establishment  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament and the economic, social and cultural council.

Nepad as a programme  of  action  of  the  African  Union,  is  a  programme
informed by the wealth of experience accumulated since independence.  It  is
driven by a commitment each African leader makes, not only to his peers  but
also to the people of the continent,  to  good  governance,  democracy,  the
rule of law  and  human  rights,  and  endeavouring  to  prevent  unresolved
situations of conflict on the continent.

Those leaders who are committed to building a strong African  Union  and  to
the success  of  its  programme  will  subject  themselves  to  peer  review
mechanism as envisaged by  Nepad.  It  is  only  those  progressive  African
countries that are driven by a desire for progress  that  will  embrace  the
peer review mechanism. This mechanism entails a periodic assessment  of  the
performance of member states on issues such as democracy and  political  and
economic governance. An independent panel will do  the  assessment  and  its
conclusions will not be used to punish, but to lend a hand to those who  are
falling  behind.  This  mechanism  is  a  voluntary  mechanism  and  has  no
precedence in the world.  Yes,  we  still  have  unresolved  conflicts:  the
Western Sahara, the DRC and now recently Côte d'Ivoire.

The birth of the African Union  must  give  hope  to  those  who  are  still
engaged in a fight for independence. Having suffered under  colonialism,  no
African state must be allowed to  subjugate  other  Africans  to  conditions
such as those that existed in East Timor and in South Africa before 1994.

The  role  of  ordinary  people  in  this  process  of  reconstruction   and
development is critical. It is through mass mobilisation  of  civil  society
and participation as a people that we  will  succeed.  Our  people  are  and
remain the prime makers of history. The African  Union  is  founded  on  the
very strong principle of mass mobilisation  and  popular  participation,  to
the  extent  that  a  special  organ  is   envisaged   for   civil   society
representation.
The creation of the Pan-African Parliament as an organ will  ensure  further
participation of our people and the creation of a  better  life.  We  should
accept that those who fear change  will  criticise  the  African  Union  and
Nepad, but they will provide  no  solution.  They  pronounce  themselves  as
revolutionaries and are quick to label  anything  that  seems  to  challenge
their comfort zones as neo-liberal.

We must engage with them and teach them that people  do  not  live  and  eat
slogans, and that shouting at the top of our voices  does  not  address  the
realities of our continent. It is those who are  engaged  in  real  struggle
who understand that solutions are not easy, but engage in a constant  battle
to better the lives of our people on the continent.

As we struggle for the creation of a better life we need  to  give  hope  to
children who know no life of their own, but only the life  imposed  on  them
by those who want to exploit the resources of the continent. A  nation  that
does not value its children has no future, and the  protection  of  children
should be at the centre of AU programmes if we are to succeed.

Given the fact that our country is the current chair of the  African  Union,
it is the submission of the working group that the National Assembly  should
extend its mandate to  pursue  work  around  the  African  Union;  that  the
working group should convene a  workshop  for  members  of  both  Houses  of
Parliament to sharpen their  understanding  of  the  task  ahead;  that  the
working group, through the Speaker and the Portfolio  Committee  on  Foreign
Affairs, should explore mechanisms to ensure that at least the  SADC  region
is taken on board in  popularising  the  African  Union;  that  a  mechanism
should be put in place to  adopt  an  African  resource  centre  within  the
premises of Parliament to ensure that we build  a  reservoir  of  knowledge,
since it is through expansion of knowledge that we will be able  to  succeed
in building a better Africa; and that Parliament should adopt  a  resolution
in support of the President, the Deputy President, the Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs and the whole  executive  for  the  good  work  they  are  doing  in
rebuilding and reconstructing  the  continent,  since  it  is  fitting  that
Parliament should thank them for the good work. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted.

                       MEDICAL SCHEMES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker,  hon  members,  the  Medical  Schemes
Amendment  Bill,  2002,  is  a  small  yet  critically  important  piece  of
legislation  from  a   health   policy   perspective.   It   signifies   our
determination to systematically break the barriers of access  to  affordable
care. It demonstrates that we shall be resolute in picking  up  conduct  and
behaviour that threaten to reintroduce the perversities that have led us  to
a dangerous and unsustainable cost spiral.

However, in doing so, we shall combine a ruthless determination with  wisdom
and judgment which can only teach us that to  deal  with  the  specific,  we
also need to understand the general.  We  are  consciously  aware  that  the
Medical Schemes Act regulates a multibillion rand industry in  our  country.
This is not an insignificant part of our national economy.

We also are painfully aware  that  there  are  many  interlinkages  in  what
constitutes our financial services sector. So an intervention  in  one  area
may  have  ramifications  well  beyond  a  particular  sector.  It  is  this
understanding and logic that informed our  painstaking  engagement  with  my
colleague, the Minister of Finance,  in  defining  the  parameters  of  this
piece of legislation.

As all hon members  are  aware,  this  engagement  between  the  Health  and
Finance Portfolio Committees was also not an easy one.  The  media  was  not
very helpful in clarifying issues to the public either. This  is  behind  us
now.

I must now thank the Portfolio Committee  on  Finance,  in  particular,  for
understanding the concerns of the Portfolio Committee on Health, as well  as
Dr Abe Nkomo, the former chairperson of the Portfolio Committee  on  Health,
for his steadfastness in this engagement with  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Finance.

Of course, we also relied heavily on  the  experience  of  the  Medical  Aid
Schemes Council. We thank the council for its focus in advising us.  I  also
take this opportunity to salute and thank  my  colleague,  the  Minister  of
Finance, Mr Trevor Manuel, for his co-operation.

Together with amendments that  were  made  to  the  Financial  Advisory  and
Intermediary Services Bill, commonly referred to as the FAIS Bill, the  Bill
creates a basis for the development of  a  sound  regulatory  framework  for
health brokers.

We share the concern of the Minister of Finance that consumers will be  best
protected if minimum  standards  of  conduct  apply  to  financial  advisers
across all sectors, including health advisers. We  therefore  fully  endorse
the need for health brokers to be  subject  to  a  common  code  of  conduct
applicable to other  financial  advisers,  and  hence  the  Medical  Schemes
Amendment Bill deletes reference to a specific code of  conduct  for  health
brokers to be promulgated under the Medical Schemes Act.

Similarly, we  fully  endorse  changes  to  the  FAIS  Bill  whereby  health
brokers, once accredited under the Medical Schemes Act, will be regarded  as
licensed under the FAIS Bill and will also be subject to the  provisions  of
that piece of legislation.

At the same time, the conduct of health brokers is an issue of  considerable
significance from a health policy perspective. The capacity  to  effectively
regulate this  sector  of  the  private  health  financing  industry  is  an
essential component of ensuring that health policy  objectives  underpinning
the Medical Schemes Act are met.

Some of the major objectives of  the  Medical  Schemes  Act  include,  among
others,  promoting  nondiscriminatory  access  to   private   health   care;
improving governance of medical schemes in the  interests  of  its  members;
ensuring  greater  financial  strength  in  the  medical  schemes  industry;
protecting  medical  schemes  and  members  against   abuse   and   unlawful
practices; and bringing greater stability to a  historically  underregulated
environment.

Health brokers have the potential to significantly contribute towards  these
health policy  objectives  through  providing  independent  best  advice  to
members or potential members of medical schemes,  thereby  guiding  them  to
make the best possible decisions to meet their health  care  needs;  growing
the total number of beneficiaries of medical schemes  and  thereby  reducing
an unnecessary burden on the public health  sector  through  focusing  their
activities on the employed but currently uninsured market;  contributing  to
the  stability  of  the  risk  pools   by   advising   against   unnecessary
fragmentation   of   employer   groups;   and   resisting   and    reporting
discriminatory and  unlawful  practices  which  threaten  to  undermine  the
policy intentions of the Medical Schemes Act.

On the other hand, health policy objectives could  be  severely  jeopardised
if even a small portion of the 7 000 or so brokers operating in  the  health
care  environment  failed  to  act  in  a   manner   consistent   with   the
implementation of health policies. Two examples will suffice.

Firstly, the greatest barrier to entry in the  medical  schemes  environment
is the rapidly escalating costs of medical scheme  contributions.  The  high
cost of medical scheme coverage not only results in differential  access  to
private health care based upon income, but also on related  issues  such  as
health status. The Registrar of Medical Schemes, in  his  annual  report  of
2001, again identified nonmedical costs as being  a  significant  driver  of
the inflation of contributions.

A progressively smaller percentage of member contributions  is  being  spent
of purchasing medical care, while an increasing proportion of  contributions
is spent on nonmedical items. This trend cannot be allowed to continue.

Clearly, there are many components of this nonmedical care expenditure,  and
we are looking critically at  each  of  them.  One  component,  however,  is
amounts paid to brokers, either directly by medical schemes  as  commission,
or indirectly through the payment to brokers of so-called  co-administration
fees by administrators, and that figure is difficult to attempt to  qualify.
It is  therefore  worth  noting  that  R290  million  was  spent  on  broker
commission in the year 2001.

Commission paid to brokers is  a  legitimate  medical  scheme  expense,  but
there needs to be an appropriate regulatory framework to ensure  that  there
is not uncontrolled expenditure on brokers contributing  to  the  spiral  of
non-healthcare expenditure of schemes, and that compensation is  appropriate
for genuine value added by brokers to medical schemes.  Within  the  context
of the  medical  schemes  environment  at  present,  this  is  an  important
regulatory objective.

Secondly, I have already said that brokers have the potential to  contribute
significantly to a more stable medical schemes  environment  and  to  expand
medical schemes coverage to previously uncovered  individuals.  However,  if
motivated by perverse financial incentives rather than  the  best  interests
of members and the medical schemes environment as a  whole,  health  brokers
can  potentially  contribute  significantly  to  the  instability   of   the
environment.

For example, while advising members or employer  groups  to  move  from  one
medical  scheme  to  another  may  be  the   best   advice   in   particular
circumstances;  if  motivated  purely  by  financial  incentive,  it   could
contribute to large-scale  churning  in  the  medical  schemes  environment,
which  significantly  undermines  administration   process   and   adds   to
administrative costs for medical schemes.

Clearly this is a concern, especially in  an  environment  where  there  has
been very minimal growth in the overall number of beneficiaries since 1996.

It can also exacerbate the worrying trend which has  developed  since  1994,
namely a shift of members out  of  the  more  protected  restricted  medical
schemes environment to the open schemes  environment.  This  is  of  concern
because the risk pool and the  future  claims  experience  in  a  restricted
scheme are more predictable.

Again,  without  the  capacity  to  regulate  broker  conduct  in  a  manner
consistent with the development of health policy, our  capacity  to  realise
the  crucial   health   policy   objective   of   ensuring   stability   and
sustainability in the medical schemes environment would be compromised.

The importance of regulatory oversight of  health  brokers,  from  a  health
policy perspective, resulted in the important function of  accreditation  of
health brokers remaining a function of the Council for Medical  Schemes  and
the retention in the Medical Schemes Act of the  provision  for  the  Health
Minister  to  make  regulations  regarding  broker  remuneration   and   the
conditions under which a broker may provide advice and other services.

Clearly, regulatory interventions,  from  a  health  perspective,  over  and
above the common framework provided by the FAIS Act, will be exercised  only
in so far as such additional intervention is necessary and  appropriate  for
the implementation of health policy.

I can see the red light is flickering, but it was important for me  to  give
the background. I will at the end summarise by actually explaining  what  is
contained in the amending Act. [Applause.]

Mr L V J NGCULU: Madam Speaker, Minister and hon members,  I  rise  in  full
support of the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill. This Bill is  a  continuation
of the road the ANC chose for South Africans, the road to  a  better  health
care system. We did so in 1998 when this House passed  the  Medical  Schemes
Act, whose objective was to protect the people  from  being  risk-rated  and
discriminated against on the  basis  of  age,  gender  and  their  state  of
health. This Medical Schemes Amendment Bill  marks  an  important  departure
from the past system, which was uncaring and unresponsive to  the  needs  of
the poor and working people.

We stand here today as a continuation of that agenda: the road to  a  caring
society, championed  by  the  people's  movement,  the  ANC.  We  are  today
piloting the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill,  whose  central  focus  is  the
protection of the consumer and the vulnerable. This Bill seeks  to  regulate
the market conduct of health care brokers and to broaden the  definition  of
broker services in order to provide for  the  conditions  under  which  such
brokers can be licensed. Such brokers will be  licensed  and  accredited  if
they meet the proper requirements as  set  out  in  this  Bill  and  in  the
Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, or  FAIS  Act,  passed  by
this House last year.

In the FAIS Bill, in particular, it was agreed that health brokers would  be
regulated by the provisions of this Act  under  the  Department  of  Health.
This was so agreed, given the fact that health per se is  not  a  commodity,
but an essential element of the wellbeing of the people.

Yet this issue will not be  treated  in  isolation,  but  there  will  be  a
symbiotic relationship between what Health does and  what  Finance  does  in
terms of the control of and conditions for brokers. Therefore an  integrated
approach to such regulation is an essential component.

It is unacceptable  and  objectionable  that  health  brokers  sold  medical
scheme membership to people, moving them around as if people were a pack  of
cards. Such a shuffling of members is by and large based  on  the  financial
interests of brokers and not  on  the  health  conditions  and  benefits  of
consumers.

Another element of this legislation  is  to  ensure  that  broker  fees  are
regulated and to avoid a situation where people are charged  exorbitant  and
unreasonable amounts. Now the broker fees will be regulated  and  controlled
by the Council for Medical Schemes.  This  is  to  ensure  that  the  policy
objectives of the Medical Schemes Act of 1998 are met,  in  particular  with
regard to the role of health-care brokers, given  the  fact  that  they  can
impact positively or negatively on factors such  as  the  stability  of  the
medical scheme risk pool and non-health care expenditure of medical  schemes
- that is, where administration costs such as brokers  services  are  passed
on to the consumers without consumers themselves benefiting.

As we have said earlier, the key and central objective of  this  legislation
is the protection of the consumer  by  ensuring  that  medical  schemes  and
health care brokers act in the interests of the beneficiaries.  This  is  in
keeping with the vision of the Department of Health,  which  strives  for  a
caring and human  society  in  which  all  South  Africans  have  access  to
affordable and good quality health care.

As the ANC we support this Bill. [Applause.]
Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, seven million people  of  the  South  African
population subscribe  to  private  medical  schemes.  Now,  given  that  the
percentage is so small, it is indeed a  competitive  industry,  so  much  so
that the consumer is often at the losing end due  to  manipulation  by  some
brokers and their agents. Often the principal broker does not  pay  his  so-
called agents a fair or timeous commission.  The  agent  or  sub-broker  may
then switch his members to another medical  scheme  for  monetary  gain.  An
inadvertent result of this could be that the member  may  not  have  medical
cover during the transition from one medical scheme to another.

The object of the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill is to  build,  broaden  and
tighten the definition of a broker to ensure proper  accreditation,  and  to
determine desirable business practice and good conduct. Member-churning  for
the purpose of monetary gain is unethical and should be rooted out.

Furthermore, the co-administration  fees  that  brokers  are  claiming  from
medical schemes  are  undesirable,  because  the  medical  scheme  does  the
administration, not the broker. This  practice  of  co-administration  under
the guise of servicing the  clients  has  in  reality  given  rise  to  many
perverse incentives in the industry at great cost to the members.  Brokerage
costs, as nonmedical costs, have amounted to some R229 million in 2000,  and
the unintended consequence of this practice on members increased  membership
fees in return for reduced medical cover.

While the broker is an important role-player, I think  an  obligation  rests
on the industry to explore other avenues  of  compensation  to  brokers  for
maintaining client relations which will eliminate churning, but  not  be  at
the cost of the member. The  proposed  amendment  will  result  in  improved
governance and oversight of medical schemes; protect schemes against  fraud;
reduce  opportunistic  behaviour  by  consumers;  offer  protection  to  the
consumer against unlawful and abusive conduct, both by medical  schemes  and
unscrupulous brokers; and create  greater  financial  stability  within  the
private health care sector.
The DP supports this amendment.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam  Speaker,  the  IFP  congratulates  the  Minister  of
Health on the original Bill. We also congratulate the ANC component  of  the
Portfolio Committee on Health, and the flexible head of the monitoring  unit
at the Medical Schemes Council, for taking on board  amendments  which  were
brought by Old Mutual Health in their submissions. As a result, with  regard
to the entire Bill, we support it.

Every effort should be made to stem the flood of rising  health  care  costs
which the Minister has alluded to, and these measures  are  applauded.  This
legislation is likely to make brokers more competent, more honest  and  more
accountable. That is why we support it without hesitation.  However,  it  is
rather like treating a heart attack with one aspirin: It is useful,  but  it
is useless without several other measures. What are they?

I want to refer members to the IFP's often  repeated,  but  not  yet  tried,
policy for health care funding. It has become all  the  more  applicable  in
line with moves to consider the Taylor  Commission's  proposals  for  social
security.

Medical schemes are not a Pandora's box. What comes out is what goes in.  If
our legislation does not provide incentives to make the schemes  competitive
and efficient  and  to  bring  on  board  young  people,  but  rather  makes
provision for anyone to be covered  at  any  age,  and  provides  provisions
which allow for opportunistic behaviour, the industry will continue  to  ail
and to fail in its objectives.

There are proposals made by the Taylor Health Commission on health  aspects,
not social welfare aspects, that  further  decrease  or  maybe  even  outlaw
savings and further regulate and engineer to make all our dreams come  true.
If implemented, they could make the situation  worse.  We  must  not  forget
that  the  current  situation  that  we  are  in  has  arisen  out  of   our
legislation, and as a result costs  have  gone  up,  memberships  have  gone
down, and benefits have decreased.

The IFP has offered simple solutions. Firstly, the Financial Services  Board
and the Registrar must jointly regulate  and  monitor  medical  schemes.  We
need hard-headed financial experts, as well as do-gooders, as this  amending
Bill has indicated. Secondly, we agree that we  should  introduce  a  social
health insurance, not as a double tax to be soaked up by Government  like  a
sponge, but a social health  insurance  which  is  an  option  amongst  many
others from which every working person must choose.

We also believe that we must resort far more to public-private  partnerships
to take care of nonworking people and of the  excessively  ill.  Instead  of
the risk equalisation fund, which is proposed by the Taylor  Commission,  we
suggest a risk pool to cope with the high cost of  certain  illnesses,  such
as antiretroviral treatment for Aids. Why? We argue that there is  a  danger
that an equalisation fund will become top heavy and bureaucratic,  and  even
reward failing schemes for their inefficiency, whereas the risk  pool  would
be funded by contributions from private schemes and  Government,  and  would
become much more efficient.
In short, the IFP offers not Midas, but Merlin, providing wise and  workable
solutions.

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, this is the second amendment to medical  schemes
legislation within  a  very  short  period  of  time.  Perhaps  this  is  an
indication of the severe pressure that this environment is experiencing.  We
are all acutely aware that contributions are increasing at  rates  that  far
exceed the inflation index, while at the same time cover  and  services  are
significantly reduced.

Common sense dictates that at this rate the end point is  a  zero  sum,  and
that medical schemes, as we know them, might be unsustainable  in  the  long
run.  The  fact  that  medical  inflation  is  normally  above  the  average
inflation because of new technology and exchange  rates,  can  explain  only
part of the problem. The other part of the  problem  is  the  administration
costs, or so-called nonmedical costs. This legislation attempts  to  address
this second category.

It has been estimated that brokers' costs contribute about R230 million  per
annum towards the so-called nonhealth expenditure. Current legislation  only
allows payment to brokers for introducing members to a scheme. This lead  to
the so-called churning of members, which is simply  the  moving  of  members
from one scheme to another.

The second problem was that the position of medical brokers in terms of  the
financial advisory and Intermediary Services Act, or FAIS,  was  not  clear.
This led to some instability in the medical scheme sphere.

Now there has been a negotiated agreement between the Department  of  Health
and the National Treasury in terms of which medical brokers fall within  the
framework of  FAIS.  However,  accreditation  of  medical  brokers  stays  a
function of the Council for Medical  Schemes.  This  means  that  a  medical
broker cannot be registered as such, unless he is accredited by the  Council
for Medical Schemes.

This proposed legislation now  formalises  this  agreement  and  furthermore
gives a clear definition of a broker to include  the  ongoing  provision  of
service to members. The  function  of  a  medical  broker  is  also  clearly
defined. Future regulations shall now hopefully be able  to  prevent  misuse
and unethical practices, and lead to a more stable environment  for  medical
brokers. This is obviously not enough to address the  total  crisis  in  the
medical schemes environment, but it at least clears up the position  of  the
medical broker.

The New NP will support this legislation.

Ms N F MATHIBELA: Madam Speaker and hon  members,  every  South  African  is
concerned about having access to appropriate health care for themselves  and
their families when they really need it. That  is  why  the  ANC  introduced
legislation to regulate the private health industry. We wanted to make  sure
that every citizen would have the same opportunities and  the  same  rights.
We care about all our citizens, not only a few.

It is important  that  both  the  public  and  private  health  sectors  see
themselves as part of an overall national health system with  the  objective
of expanding access to adequate health care for our entire population.

When it comes to getting access  to  health  care  in  the  private  sector,
health brokers have an important role to play in ensuring  that  people  get
the sort of health care that they need.  Choosing  between  medical  schemes
and all the benefit options among medical schemes can be very  confusing  to
the average person on  the  street.  Brokers  can  assist  these  people  to
understand the best medical scheme options to meet  their  own  health  care
needs. Health brokers can therefore help to advance the  objectives  of  the
national health system if the advice they provide  is  independent  and  the
best advice for the client concerned.

The Medical Schemes Amendment Bill goes a long way in recognising this  role
of brokers. At the same time,  it  is  very  important  that  consumers  are
optionally protected against any unscrupulous health brokers that  may  wish
to exploit the trust of the public for their own  financial  gain.  Together
with the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services  Act,  the  amendments
now being made to the Medical Schemes Act create enabling conditions for  an
environment in which consumers can feel confident that their  interests  are
being looked after. It  is  in  the  interests  of  consumers,  brokers  and
medical schemes that  unlawful,  unethical  and  discriminatory  conduct  is
wiped out. We hope that all of these interest groups will come  together  to
use the legislative environment which has been created to achieve this.

The ANC therefore supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, the  growth  in  the
medical scheme sector over the past few years has  been  phenomenal.  Growth
can be expected to continue as the law and  escalating  medical  fees  force
South Africans to become members of medical schemes.

The medical scheme sector has  become  a  multimillion-rand  industry  which
affects  the  lives  of  countless  South  Africans.  The  result  of  these
developments has been the need to improve the quality of regulation  in  the
medical scheme sector in order to protect citizens  and  ensure  that  those
who act as medical scheme brokers comply with the same  high  standards  and
regulations that other professionals in the medical sector are held to.

The amending Bill before us therefore amends  the  Medical  Schemes  Act  of
1998, in order to include the definition of  a  broker  as  a  person  whose
business involves three broad areas of activity, namely the introduction  or
admission of members to a medical scheme; the transfer of members  from  one
medical scheme to another; and the ongoing provision of benefits and  access
to services offered by the  medical  scheme.  This  definition  expands  the
category of people who can be defined as brokers by extending  the  type  of
work  associated  with  such  brokers  beyond  the  mere  introduction   and
admission of members,  to  include  the  ongoing  provision  of  advice  and
services.
The Bill ensures that the wide range of people  who  are  engaged  in  these
activities are  regulated  in  accordance  with  the  rules  that  apply  to
accredited brokers. What this ensures is that no person may act as a  broker
or receive remuneration  for  such  activities  if  such  a  person  is  not
accredited and  does  not  submit  to  the  conditions  for  providing  such
services.

The Bill paves the way for a single  gateway  for  accreditation  of  health
brokers.  Furthermore,  it  enables  the  legislative  framework   for   the
agreement on joint regulation of medical brokers by the Council for  Medical
Schemes and the Financial Services Board.

It  is  hoped  that  these  provisions  will  protect  South  Africans  from
unscrupulous business activities  in  this  sector,  and  thus  also  assist
medical schemes to  conduct  their  business  in  a  proper  way,  with  the
necessary credibility and integrity.

The UDM therefore supports the Bill.
Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, Madam Minister, the Bill  provides  for  a
new definition of ``broker'', and gives greater clarity on  the  duty  of  a
broker. This may well lead to better  client  relations  and  trust  in  the
medical schemes industry. Clients are normally dependent  on  the  expertise
of industry personnel and will take at face value  the  advice  provided  by
such persons. The Bill differentiates between  the  role  of  a  broker  and
other medical scheme providers, thus limiting  the  confusion  and  possible
overtrading of medical schemes products.

The broker is required by the new provisions to give as much information  as
possible to clients and to provide them with the correct  product  fit  from
time to time to suit the  needs  of  the  customer.  The  advice  given  and
options they provide to the client will  become  more  transparent,  with  a
lower risk of manipulation benefiting broker deals.

The  Bill  provides  that  a  broker's  compensation  should  be  determined
according to the rules of a medical scheme.  The  ACDP  agrees  that  broker
accreditation is vital  for  professionalism  and  accountability.  We  are,
however, of the opinion that in terms of medical scheme services,  a  broker
who is accredited should benefit from an ongoing compensation  in  terms  of
continuous service. The Bill only intimates the  potential  to  do  so,  but
does not adequately prescribe this role. We hope that greater  clarity  will
be achieved within the industry as it  seeks  to  address  the  compensation
ratio of brokers in this regard.

[Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, beautiful South  Africans,  we  all  understand
that this medical aid scheme is not enough. We, as the black people, do  not
benefit that much because our people in the rural areas do not earn  a  lot.
They die due to  a  lack  of  proper  medical  attention  because  they  are
excluded from this medical aid scheme. They are poor and jobless.

Some public servants who receive better medical attention  because  of  this
medical aid scheme abuse its funds, even  if  they  should  think  of  other
people. The UCDP agrees to this Bill.]

In the memorandum of the Bill it is stated that there has been some lack  of
clarity with regard to how medical scheme brokers  should  be  regulated  in
their conduct of business and the extent to which this can be  done  by  the
Financial Services Board. An agreement had been reached between the  Council
for  Medical  Schemes  and  the  Financial  Services  Board  regarding   the
regulation of brokers, and the Bill is meant to address that.

The Medical Schemes Act 131 was passed in 1998, and it essentially aimed  to
provide for improved governance and administration of medical schemes.  This
Act  is  now  amended  through  the  Medical  Schemes  Amendment  Bill.  The
objectives are to extend the definition of ``broker''  and  to  provide  for
conditions under which a broker must be accredited.

Clause 2(a) does not stipulate that  only  medical  schemes  may  compensate
brokers. The definition of a broker should perhaps  include  what  is  spelt
out in clause 2(c) of the amendment Bill. This makes reference to  a  broker
as someone who has received accreditation. It is  suggested  that  the  word
``accreditation'' be included in the redefinition of the word ``broker''.

Clause 3 amends section 67 of the  principal  Act  to  allow  the  Minister,
after consultation with the council, to make  regulations  relating  to  the
conditions under which brokers may provide advice and other  services  to  a
medical scheme beneficiary or other persons.

We congratulate the Minister on this Bill.

Miss  S  RAJBALLY:  Madam  Speaker,  each  sphere  of  government  has   its
magnifying glasses on the loopholes that need to be closed  in  response  to
the change brought about in our  society,  namely  democracy.  A  revamp  of
structures and the introduction of a constitutional state set the stage  for
transportation, but also for the adjustments  that  needed  to  be  made  to
legislation, in this case the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill.

In  an  open  and  democratic  society  governed  by  its  people,   we   as
representative  authorities  have  to  ensure  the   good   governance   and
management of all spectrums. For this, we must thank the Minister.

Medical schemes have been the topic of the debate and concern  a  number  of
times. The 1998 Act appears to be a well-drafted piece of legislation  whose
mechanisms needed just a few amendments, as is being done here. We  need  to
constantly reassure the public that delivery is taking place.

When a Bill is being amended, this does not necessarily  mean  that  it  has
failed, but rather that the legislation has a few loopholes and needs to  go
back to the drawing board for a little adjustment. It also demonstrates  the
earnestness of the Government to deliver, and reflects  constant  review  of
policy, which is very important for a rapidly changing society.

The amending Bill makes provision for clarity regarding the term  ``broker''
and other measures pertaining to this position.

The MF supports the amending Bill. [Applause.]

Dr E E JASSAT: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members,  this  afternoon  I
propose to deal briefly with the genesis of this Bill. The  Medical  Schemes
Act, that is the principal Act, was gazetted in 1998. The Act  replaced  the
Medical Schemes Act of 1967. It was meant to act in tandem with the  private
health financing policy set out in the White Paper on the transformation  of
the national health system issued in 1997.

A strategy for implementing the policy had been  captured  in  the  document
``Reforming  Financing  of  Private  Health  Care  in  South  Africa.''  The
preamble outlining the aims  of  the  present  Bill  states,  amongst  other
things, that the Bill  seeks  to  protect  the  interests  of  members.  The
principal Act does not specifically speak of brokers.

An amendment to the Medical Schemes Bill of 1998 was  introduced  late  last
year. It defined brokers and attempted  to  limit  the  purposes  for  which
medical schemes may compensate them, and to provide for  the  regulation  of
their professional conduct.

On 19 October 2002, the personal  finance  supplement  of  the  Johannesburg
Star carried this report, and I quote:


  The life assurance industry is reconsidering a  decision  it  made  three
  years ago  to  revive  tough  restrictions  on  financial  advisers  that
  prevented them from advising you to switch from one life assurance policy
  to another. Switching generates a new set of commission for advisers, but
  also additional costs and potential losses for you.

During the past two years, since the restrictions were  dropped,  there  has
been a massive increase in switching in the life  assurance  industry.  This
is exactly what has taken place with medical schemes. In  order  to  prevent
such a trend  in  the  private  health  sector,  and  to  pre-empt  perverse
incentives, this amending Bill is being introduced.

On 6 September the Council  for  Medical  Schemes  issued  a  press  release
warning that it was, and I quote again -


  ... cracking down on unacceptable and unlawful behaviour amongst  brokers
  selling medical scheme membership.

It has been estimated that brokers contribute in excess of R230  million  to
the non-health costs of the medical scheme industry, clearly adding  to  the
burden of members. We are very  happy  to  note  that  the  outcome  of  the
negotiated agreement between the National Treasury  and  the  Department  of
Health will ensure that brokers will  be  subject  to  a  common  framework,
provided by the FAIS Act, but leaving the  accreditation  of  brokers  under
the Medical Schemes Act  to  be  a  function  of  the  Council  for  Medical
Schemes.

With these few words, on behalf of the ANC, I would  like  to  support  this
Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Mr Chairperson, I am sure that  members  will  agree
with me that we have indeed taken solid steps in discharging our  duty,  and
this is symbolised by the consensus of parties in  support  of  the  Medical
Schemes Amendment Bill.

May I say that the UCDP  would  have  been  advised  to  introduce  its  own
amendments during the deliberations of the  portfolio  committee.  We  would
have included them, so that there would be complete consensus.
Without the capacity to regulate broker conduct in a manner consistent  with
the development of health policy, as I said, our  capacity  to  realise  the
crucial health policy objective of ensuring stability and sustainability  in
the medical schemes  environment  would  be  compromised.  That  would  also
compromise our objective of protecting members of medical schemes.

The importance of regulatory oversight of  health  brokers,  from  a  health
policy perspective, resulted in the important function of the  accreditation
of health brokers remaining a function of the Council for  Medical  Schemes,
and retention in the Medical Schemes Act of the  provision  for  the  Health
Minister  to  make  regulations  regarding  broker  remuneration   and   the
conditions under which a broker may provide advice and  other  services.  As
we have heard, all the parties agree with that.

Clearly, regulatory interventions,  from  a  health  perspective,  over  and
above the common framework provided by FAIS, will be exercised  only  in  so
far as such additional intervention is necessary  and  appropriate  for  the
implementation of health policy.

An important change that is introduced by this amending  Bill,  however,  is
that for the first time  the  Medical  Schemes  Act  will  provide  explicit
recognition of the role of health brokers in providing ongoing  service  and
advice to members of medical schemes, as opposed to the existing wording  in
the Act, which is restricted to services relating  to  the  introduction  of
members only.

This was a necessary amendment to prevent regulatory arbitration of  brokers
between the Council for Medical Schemes and the  Financial  Services  Board,
in light of the provisions in the FAIS Act which included ongoing advice  in
respect of health products as a function of financial service providers.

In the absence  of  this  amendment,  the  Medical  Schemes  Act,  with  the
implementation of the FAIS Act broker award, effectively has  been  able  to
opt out of the  regulatory  jurisdiction  of  the  Medical  Schemes  Act  by
structuring  their  services  in  such  a  way  as  to   exclude   so-called
introductory services and to provide only for ongoing services.

Explicit recognition in the  Bill  of  the  role  of  brokers  in  providing
ongoing service, as reflected in the expanded definition of  ``broker'',  as
already mentioned, has been welcomed by industry brokers,  and  particularly
by organisations representing health brokers.

In its presentation to the portfolio committee during  the  public  hearings
on the Bill, the Financial Planning Institute, for  example,  indicated  its
support for the amending Bill in general, and welcomed  the  recognition  of
the ongoing role of the broker in the industry.

They and other commentators have urged that the  statutory  recognition  for
the role of brokers in providing ongoing service to members should  also  be
reflected in the regulations under the Medical Schemes Act,  in  so  far  as
those  regulations  provide  a  framework  for   the   regulation   of   the
remuneration of health brokers. These comments have been taken into  account
in the reformulation of the amendments to the regulations contained  in  the
Medical Schemes Act which is due to be promulgated shortly.

I believe that the debate on the  appropriate  regulatory  jurisdiction  for
health brokers  which  surrounded  the  passage  of  the  FAIS  Act  through
Parliament and gave rise to these amendments, was a necessary  and  fruitful
debate that resulted in an optimal framework for the  regulation  of  health
brokers. In the implementation of  this  framework,  I  look  forward  to  a
healthy co-operation  between  the  Council  for  Medical  Schemes  and  the
Financial Services Board, which will  result  in  an  environment  in  which
consumers are optimally protected.

In conclusion, let  me  express  my  infinite  gratitude  to  the  portfolio
committee for the work they did on this Bill  and,  again,  for  reaching  a
unanimous consensus on the amendments to be made to this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
Bill read a second time.

           OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES IN MINES AND WORKS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Mr Chairperson and hon members, I have  pleasure  in
presenting  to  the  House  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  Occupational
Diseases in Mines and Works Act of 1973.

At the outset, I would like to thank the Portfolio Committee on  Health  for
the manner in which they processed this Bill and for  reaching  a  unanimous
decision, again, on the amendments to be  effected.  I  am  pre-empting  the
UCDP! In particular, I would  like  to  thank  the  chairperson,  hon  James
Ngculu, for guiding the discussions on this Bill.

In the past, occupational  health  has  been  neglected  and  yet  the  fact
remains that,  globally,  over  a  million  workers  die  from  work-related
diseases and injuries, and there are over 160 million cases of  work-related
diseases annually. In South Africa, the burden  of  disease  resulting  from
working in mines is unacceptably high.  Approximately  25  000  compensation
applications are made per year  for  occupational  diseases  resulting  from
working in mines.

The types of lung diseases that  commonly  occur  are  silicosis,  which  is
caused by the inhalation of dust, asbestosis,  chronic  obstructive  airways
disease and coal workers' pneumoconiosis.  In  the  past,  compensation  for
these occupational diseases was a privilege of the few. Prior to 1993,  only
white mineworkers were entitled to be examined by  the  Medical  Bureau  for
Occupational Diseases and received compensation if they  had  a  certifiable
disease.

The Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act  was  amended  in  1993  to
allow all miners, both black and  white,  to  be  examined  by  the  Medical
Bureau for Occupational Diseases. In 1997, the Mine Health  and  Safety  Act
was  implemented,  which  took  the  responsibility  for   benefit   medical
examinations of  current  mineworkers  away  from  the  Medical  Bureau  for
Occupational Diseases and placed this responsibility on the  employer.  This
change greatly improved the efficiency of the system.

In order to continuously  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  system  and  to
prevent backlogs, consultations were held with the relevant stakeholders.  A
tripartite committee  comprising  workers,  namely  the  National  Union  of
Mineworkers and the Mineworkers' Union; the employers, which is the  Chamber
of Mines; and  Government,  which  is  the  Department  of  Health  and  the
Department of Minerals  and  Energy,  was  initiated  in  1997  to  consider
sections of the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act which  affected
its efficient administration. This was necessitated by the  amendments  that
had been effected to the Act in 1994,  which  made  its  interpretation  and
administration difficult.

The tripartite committee  made  three  main  recommendations  that  required
further amendments. In summary, these recommendations related to the  period
between medical examinations, placing responsibility for medical care  costs
on the employers where the disease was  contracted  and,  most  importantly,
making it a criminal offence if any person who  assists  the  miner  charges
exorbitant fees.

I will expand  on  each  of  these  amendments  and  explain  the  need  and
rationale for the changes. The first amendment relates to the change in  the
period for re-examination of the ex-mineworker. Currently,  the  Act  states
that the ex-mineworker can be re-examined after six months,  yet  the  World
Health Organisation has produced guidelines on  public  health  surveillance
for people who have been exposed to dust such as silica  and  asbestos,  and
recommends that re-examinations should be performed every 24 months.

The reason for this is that there is a slow progression  of  disease  caused
by these dusts,  and  that  X-ray  changes,  which  are  essential  for  the
diagnosis of the disease, do not show up within a short  period.  Therefore,
examinations performed every six months will not have a significant value.
There is a better chance that changes can  be  detected  on  the  X-rays  if
examinations are  performed  every  24  months,  and  this  will  also  help
immensely in  quantifying  disability.  In  addition,  frequent  X-rays  are
discouraged because we know that frequent use of X-rays  negatively  affects
a person's health. For these reasons, we are therefore amending  section  22
of the Act, from six months to 24 months for the re-examination of  the  ex-
mineworker.

The House can be reassured, however, that under section 32(3)  of  the  Act,
provision is made that if the doctor  who  examines  the  ex-miner  realises
that the condition of the ex-miner is getting worse and the  application  is
supported in writing by the examining doctor, the director  of  the  Medical
Bureau for Occupational Diseases has to  give  permission  for  examination,
even if the period is less that 24 months.

The second amendment relates to the issue of  who  is  responsible  for  the
payment of compensation. Section 36(A) of the principal Act  is  amended  to
provide that the owner of the mine or works shall for a period of  not  more
than two years from the date of commencement  of  a  compensatable  disease,
pay the reasonable costs incurred by or on behalf of a person in his or  her
service, in respect of the medical aid necessitated by such disease.

A further amendment is made to place responsibility on the employer  of  the
mine where  the  disease  was  contracted.  Section  36(A)(1)  is  therefore
amended to provide that the  owner  of  the  mine  where  the  compensatable
disease was contracted should continue to pay the reasonable costs  incurred
by the miner or on behalf of a person in his or her  service,  even  if  the
miner has moved to work in another mine.

The third, and I believe the most important change, relates to  the  problem
we have been experiencing around unscrupulous behaviour of  certain  persons
who assist the miners to get their compensations.  It  has  saddened  us  to
discover that many people who have been compensated  ended  up  receiving  a
small amount of money, due to the so-called  community  representatives  and
attorneys who invariably take a lion's share of the claimant's benefit as  a
fee.

I am sure that  the  House  will  agree  that  this  kind  of  practice,  of
exploiting the most vulnerable, is unacceptable and must be stopped.  Hence,
section 124(1) of the principal Act is amended to provide that if  a  person
charges for services rendered in  respect  of  assistance  in  claiming  any
benefit of this Act, charges a fee or claims remuneration from  a  person  -
in this case the miner - which is in excess of 0,5% of the  benefit  awarded
to such a person, he or she will be guilty of an offence.

These are the amendments which are tabled before the House. They may  appear
to be minor amendments, but they have  far-reaching  implications  and  they
will unblock some of the problems experienced thus far.

I must thank the NUM-Cosatu delegation for making a  lucid  presentation  to
the portfolio committee and for agreeing with the Department  of  Health  to
change the period for re-examination of ex-miners  from  six  months  to  24
months, even though their original proposal had been  36  months.  In  their
own words, they said the Bill represented a significant step  in  addressing
the  unnecessary  problems  and  limitations  imposed  by   the   Act,   and
facilitates the harmonisation of the compensation system in our country.

I am also aware that the portfolio committee has considered  the  submission
which was made by the Chamber of Mines. I  am  confident  that  hon  members
will agree that there are sound and reasonable arguments for these  changes,
and will support the proposed changes. These changes are also  essential  to
ensure that, overall, we create greater efficiency in the system  and,  more
importantly, we carry out our mandate as elected representatives to  protect
the public and, in this case, the ex-miners. [Applause.]

Mrs M M MALUMISE: Chairperson, today I want to  pay  tribute  to  all  those
workers who died as a result of occupational diseases and  thus  a  lack  of
safety standards in their workplace.  In  2002,  when  we  have  the  latest
technology at the tips of our fingers, when  nothing  seems  impossible  any
longer, we still find that people are dying in the mines.  Spare  a  thought
for the workers who died  on  the  sugarcane  farms  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  the
chemical workers and the woman who lost her baby because she was  locked  up
in a factory and could not get out.

Since the ANC has been in government, occupational health  and  safety  have
been given much more prominence than  ever  before.  We  have,  as  the  ANC
Government, made it clear that our workers, the vulnerable and the poor  are
our most important constituency, and that is why we make  policies  to  make
the lives of workers easier. We stand by our  motto,  ``a  better  life  for
all'', and we demand that the heads of industry take our resolve  seriously.
Our efforts to improve the lives of our workers  will  not  be  derailed  by
negligence and an unwillingness to provide safer working conditions.

Today we are sending out a clear message to industry that we  are  going  to
watch them and make sure that they start implementing  our  legislation.  We
are saying to the respective unions that  we  need  them  to  be  even  more
proactive, to represent the interests  of  workers  tirelessly,  to  educate
workers about their rights, such as their right to safe working  conditions.
We also want  to  appeal  to  the  paralegals  and  others  who  assist  the
claimants not to act unethically by robbing  the  poor  and  sick  of  their
payouts.

The poor state of occupational health service provision in South Africa  has
been well documented. The Erasmus Commission noted as far back as 1976  that
very little time, money and organisation had been put  into  the  prevention
of occupational diseases. Industry has  a  shameful  record  in  controlling
occupational disease. They have been negligent  in  preventing  occupational
ill health and they have been even slower in compensating  workers  who  are
suffering from occupation-related diseases. They have been quick  to  invest
their profits on the stock market, but have been slow  to  invest  in  their
workforce.

It is estimated that up to two  million  people  are  eligible  for  benefit
examinations in respect of occupational diseases, but financial and  medical
resources are available for only a small fraction, fewer  than  32  000  per
year.

Compensation is a right for all workers.  The  provision  of  effective  and
accessible services for identifying and compensating  occupational  injuries
and disease is an obligation that our Government is taking seriously,  hence
the legislation. It  is  especially  important  that  industry  honours  its
contract with its employees to prevent diseases,  and  to  pay  compensation
precisely because our public health is buckling  under  the  strain  of  too
many preventable diseases such as HIV/Aids, TB, malaria, cholera and so  on.
The vast number of migrant workers who have returned to  their  rural  homes
do not have access to  medical  services  which  are  able  and  willing  to
investigate their condition and complete the necessary forms. As  a  result,
South  African  and  international  industries  which  exposed  workers   to
injurious  dust  or  toxic  chemicals  have  been  able  to   disown   their
responsibilities, and thereby transfer significant costs to  the  state  and
to already poor families. This is indeed a shame. This point is  underscored
by studies done in Lesotho which show  that  there  has  been  a  systematic
transfer of the costs of disability due to  injury  or  ill  health  to  the
communities from which workers have been recruited.

Community-based activity in the Northern Province, the  Border  district  in
the Eastern Cape, Welkom where I come from and the Northern Cape shows  that
there is  a  huge  reservoir  of  undetected,  and  therefore  uncompensated
occupational lung disease.

Enacting the legislation we are debating today is a matter  of  urgency.  We
must work hard to strengthen our capacity to implement our policies, and  we
must ensure that we review occupational health and safety  legislation  from
time to time. Resources must be  committed  to  extend  occupational  health
services at all levels, and we need to put in place measures to ensure  that
statutory obligations are complied with. If we are moving from  the  premise
that  occupational  health  service  is  based  on  the  infrastructure   of
provincial health services and the district health level, we  will  have  to
strengthen these levels of our health system  so  that  people  receive  the
services they deserve.

Since prevention is the primary aim, occupational health must  be  practised
at work places, not in clinics and hospitals when workers fall ill and  when
it is too late. Because workers with work-related problems will  present  to
the general curative health services, occupational health services  need  to
be integrated into these comprehensive services. In effect, this means  that
the primary responsibility for control of hazards and for the  provision  of
occupational health services lies with the employer.

Lastly, next time hon members buy a  fine  piece  of  gold  jewellery  or  a
crystal-clear diamond or even a pot for a plant, they should say  a  prayer:
``Our heavenly Father, we pray today in the name  of  Jesus  that  you  give
physical, social, spiritual and financial help and strength  to  the  worker
who is putting his life and health on the line''.
The ANC supports this transformatory Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Chairperson, there is no doubt in any of our minds that  the
mining industry is one of the pillars of the  South  African  economy.  This
industry is a major employer with just under 400 000 in its service  in  the
year  2000.  Whilst  sudden  death  or  injury  remains  the   most   feared
consequence of working underground in  general,  the  reality  is  that  the
annual certifications for preumoconiosis, plus new cases  of  TB  in  miners
far exceed the annual number of injuries reported in this population.

Silica inhalation and silicosis greatly increase the risk of TB  in  miners.
The HIV epidemic has added a deadly ingredient  by  further  increasing  the
risk of TB in HIV positive miners. Death while on treatment for  TB  is  now
the most common form of mortality amongst active  gold  miners  and  exceeds
the death rate from accidents. Lung disease and hearing loss are  two  major
mining-related diseases which are carried for life  by  a  large  number  of
former  and  present  miners.  Many  of  the  former  miners   suffer   from
preumoconiosis, which is the deposit of dust in  the  lung  and  the  lung's
reaction to it.

This amending Bill will go a long way towards enhancing the quality of  life
of miners who may be ill as a direct result of an  occupational  disease  in
the  sense  that  it  seeks  to  extend  the  application  for  the  medical
examination from six to 24 months. The extension is based  on  World  Health
Organisation guidelines and is very relevant, because it  is  based  on  the
fact that the latency period for occupational diseases  is  quite  long.  In
some cases it is known that these  diseases  may  manifest  some  ten  years
after exposure.

There is no doubt in my mind that an obligation rests  on  the  industry  to
lessen the burden of occupational disease. One such  strategy  would  be  to
look at a preventive approach based on exposure management,  as  opposed  to
the present reactive management systems.

The capping of the compensation fee is also a welcome amendment. There  have
been  many  reported  cases  of  so-called  community  representatives   and
attorneys assisting miners to claim for compensation, but who  actually  end
up taking the bulk of the money, and the miner is no richer or  wiser.  This
protection clause will ensure that the money actually reaches the person  it
is intended for.

It is my considered opinion that this amending  Bill  goes  a  fair  way  to
address the responsibility of the mining industry to its workers in  respect
of occupational diseases.

The DP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, on behalf of the IFP I would like not only  to
echo hon Malumise's prayer for the mineworkers, but  say  that  we  all  owe
them a debt of gratitude for the contribution that they  have  made  towards
building up the country. Certainly we owe it to them to  look  after  health
compensation. We are in the fortunate position  of  being  able  to  support
both Health Bills brought before Parliament today, and even  to  support  an
amendment brought by the  unions,  because  they  clarified  the  conditions
under which compensation should be paid.

In miner terminology, I  believe  that  this  Act  is  referred  to  as  the
``Odimwa Act''. It does  appear,  however,  that  although  we  support  the
amendments, the overall  Odimwa  Act  does  have  its  limitations.  At  the
hearings I asked one of  the  people  from  the  unions  who  was  making  a
submission, why, in his opinion,  there  was  such  a  reduction  in  health
services provided by the mines. They  were  once  among  the  best  services
provided in the country. He answered that the mines were not  interested  in
people; they were only interested in resources.

Pursuing the question further with  some  of  the  mine  representatives,  I
sought further answers and got from them a very different set of  responses.
As with the previous Bill, I would say  their  problems  and  those  of  the
mineworkers would be solved by many of the IFP's policies. Health is  not  a
commodity, and it cannot be  left  to  respond  to  market  forces,  but  it
involves people, and they respond to the  positive  or  perverse  incentives
which governments provide.

If the Government decides who must do what, where, it  leads  to  unintended
consequences, and it turns out that mines providing  reduced  provisions  to
workers is one of the unintended consequences  of  our  policies.  They  say
that because of a combination of  union  pressure,  unrealistic  demands  of
Government  and  workers,  the  threat   of   bureaucratic   licensing   and
procurement   procedures,   secrecy   provisions   around   Aids   and   the
politicisation of Aids, the mines have  decided  to  progressively  withdraw
from providing health care.

What are the IFP's  solutions?  We  must  provide  more  meaningful  public-
private partnerships in which Government shares both  the  burdens  and  the
cost of providing care with the  public  sector.  Incentives  for  treatment
must be provided in rural areas for  poor  people,  for  labourers  and  for
mineworkers, to private management organisations and  NGOs.  The  Government
must lay down  minimum  standards  and  encourage  original  and  innovative
solutions from all its partners.

While we are amending this Act, we are aware of other wider problems  around
worker  compensation.  There  is   another   Act,   the   Compensation   for
Occupational Injuries and  Diseases  Act,  which  contradicts  some  of  the
provisions  of  the  legislation  under  discussion.  The  Compensation  for
Occupational Injuries and Diseases  Act  also  deals  with  compensation  of
mineworkers, but evidently it provides for different conditions,  and  there
will be contradictions between that Act and Odimwa. It is essential that  we
have compensatory provisions which are appropriate and which  stop  victims,
such as people with asbestosis, from being trapped in a  vacuum,  and  which
stop the mines from being threatened with closure because they have to  cope
with suits which require ongoing punitive damages.

Yes, we did take on board submissions by the  mines,  but  it  appears  that
they are not completely comfortable with  the  changes  that  we  introduced
afterwards. The tripartite agreement to which the mines referred was  agreed
to in the days of Olive Shishana, and that goes  back  quite  a  long  time.
Since then, under the Compensation for Occupational  Injuries  and  Diseases
Act, the Compensation Commission is evidently mired in fraud charges.  As  I
said, the provisions of  the  Compensation  for  Occupational  Injuries  and
Diseases Act which covers mineworkers are in conflict  with  the  provisions
of the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act.

In view of the black economic empowerment objectives  of  the  mine  charter
and the mineral and energy legislation, it  will  not  be  a  good  idea  to
burden the mining companies with responsibilities that cripple them,  rather
than holding them to account. While this  legislation  moves  in  the  right
direction, while we still  have  secrecy  around  Aids,  while  there  is  a
contradiction with other legislation,  and  while  bureaucratic  commissions
are not running efficiently, we are not necessarily doing the best  that  we
can for our mineworkers in the near and distant future.

Dr S J GOUS: Mr Chairperson, it is understandable that working in  mines  is
a dangerous business. Mineworkers are  exposed  to  an  extremely  dangerous
environment and are not only at risk in terms  of  accidents,  but  also  in
terms of exposure to elements that can have a detrimental  effect  on  their
health and, in most cases, many, many years after the exposure.

Currently this principal Act provides  that  the  director  of  the  Medical
Bureau for Occupational Diseases may refuse an  application  if  the  person
concerned was medically examined within a period of six  months  immediately
preceding the date  on  which  such  application  is  received,  unless  the
application  is  supported  in  writing  by  a  medical  practitioner.  This
amending Bill proposes to extend this period to 24 months.  The  reason  for
this is that diseases  caused  by  exposure  normally  take  many  years  to
develop. Apart from tuberculosis and certain  forms  of  heart  disease,  we
refer to exposure diseases collectively  as  pneumoconiosis.  These  include
silicosis,  asbestosis,  coal  workers'  lung   disease   and   mixed   dust
pneumoconiosis.
This proposal is in line with World Health Organisation recommendations  and
also prevents over-exposure to X-rays, which can have a negative  effect  on
their own.

The Bill further seeks to ensure that the owner of a controlled  mine  or  a
controlled works shall, for  an  unlimited  period  from  the  date  of  the
commencement of a compensatable disease, pay the reasonable  costs  incurred
by a person, even if he leaves the mine or works.

Lastly,  the  Bill  seeks  to  address  the  situation  where  a   so-called
commissioner, community  representative  or  attorney  who  is  assisting  a
claimant, ends up receiving most of the compensation.  This  amount  is  now
clearly limited to 0,5% of the benefit awarded and will go  a  long  way  in
protecting the interests of the worker.

Overall, this  is  good  legislation  and  the  New  NP  shall  support  it.
[Applause.]

Mr M I MOSS: Mr Chairperson, the Occupational Diseases in  Mines  and  Works
Amendment Bill is a very good one, not only for  those  workers  who  suffer
injuries at work, but also for those who  contract  diseases  and  illnesses
through inhalation.

I want to concentrate mostly on  the  effect  that  these  diseases  had  on
asbestos mining. Asbestos mining in South Africa stopped in 1979,  but  many
people are still dying, in  spite  of  these  mining  operations  no  longer
taking place. The  legacy  of  asbestos  mining  has  resulted  in  enormous
suffering for South Africans with asbestos-related diseases  and  for  those
who have lost loved ones as a result of these  illnesses.  Most  victims  of
asbestos-related deaths are from the Northern Cape  and  Limpopo  provinces.
The poor, dangerous and inhumane working conditions  that  mineworkers  were
exposed to were not the only causes of death. The  workers  and  communities
are still dying today as a  result  of  dust  they  are  inhaling  from  the
asbestos mine dumps.

A 1962 confidential report by the  Pneumoconiosis  Research  Unit  of  South
Africa revealed that people who lived in Prieska, Koegas, Kuruman and  Penge
were  in  danger  of  contracting  asbestosis,  even  though  they  had   no
industrial exposure to asbestos dust  inhalation.  An  article  in  a  South
African journal by Prof Tony Davis, former director of the  National  Centre
for Occupational Health in  Johannesburg,  referred  to  13%  of  deaths  in
Prieska having been caused by mesothelioma, an asbestos-related disease.

Vandag vind 'n mens baie weeskinders in Kuruman, nie net as gevolg van  Vigs
en MIV, soos vandag gesê word  nie,  maar  baie  van  hierdie  jongmense  is
vandag ouerloos as gevolg van hierdie asbessiektes. Baie  van  hierdie  jong
kinders sterf vandag selfs nadat die myne al toegemaak het  voor  hulle  nog
gebore is - 'n baie  treurige  situasie!  [Today  one  finds  many  orphaned
children in Kuruman, not only as a result of Aids and HIV, as is being  said
today, but many of these young people are orphaned today  because  of  these
asbestos-related diseases. Many of these  young  children  are  still  dying
today, even after these mines had been closed down before they were  born  -
a very sad situation!]

Many departments, namely Health, Justice, Labour, Minerals and  Energy,  and
Environmental Affairs and Tourism are involved in addressing and  trying  to
resolve the suffering of these communities.

The Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs and Tourism  has  for  some
years now monitored asbestos-related issues.  The  committee  did  not  only
concentrate on the negative impact that asbestos  has  on  the  environment,
but also on the impact it has on the South  African  citizens  at  large.  A
national asbestos summit was held from 23 to 26  November  1998  where  four
departmental commissions were established, one of which  dealt  with  health
remediation and compensation to sufferers of asbestos-related diseases.

The House of Lords in London, on 20 July 2000, gave a judgment in favour  of
more than 3 000 asbestos workers, allowing  their  claims  to  be  heard  in
London. The defendant, Cape PLC Asbestos, had been attempting  to  stop  the
case from being heard in the courts.  The  decision  meant  that  the  South
Africans would be able to process the case immediately.

Cape PLC, one of the world's largest asbestos companies, operated  in  South
Africa from the 1890s until  1999,  when  it  disinvested.  Blue  and  brown
asbestos mining took place on a massive  scale  in  the  Northern  Cape  and
Limpopo provinces, respectively. Thousands of workers developed serious  and
fatal diseases such as asbestosis and the cancer known as mesothelioma.

Although an out-of-court settlement was reached in favour of the workers  to
be compensated, to date no money has been paid to  these  workers.  Pressure
groups in South Africa and Britain are campaigning by  picketing  and  other
means to ensure that Cape PLC does compensate the  South  Africans  who  are
dying and suffering as a result of asbestosis.

The claimant lawyer, solicitor Richard Meeran of  Leigh,  Day  and  Company,
said at the time of the judgment:
  The House of Lords decision is a victory for justice which has  signalled
  a new era both in terms of the legal accountability of multinationals and
  the protection of human rights by the English courts.  I  hope  Cape  PLC
  will now settle the claims as quickly as possible to help  alleviate  the
  desperate suffering of the victims.

Leigh, Day and Company are also  acting  on  behalf  of  hundreds  of  other
asbestos victims in actions  against  Turner  Newhall  in  relation  to  the
operations in Swaziland, Zimbabwe and India.

The South African Government fully supported the claimants' case before  the
House of Lords  in  London,  and  made  representations  as  to  the  public
interests of South Africa.

An  asbestos  summit  which  took  place  in  Brazil  two  years   ago   was
overwhelmingly in favour of all asbestos mining being banned.

The  Portfolio  Committee  on  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  visited
Zimbabwe where asbestos mining  is  still  taking  place  on  a  big  scale.
Although the report of the visit found the mining in Zimbabwe to  be  fairly
safe,  if  mined  correctly,  South  Africa  should  support   the   growing
international feeling that asbestos mining and related products  be  banned,
especially  when  alternative  products  can  be  found.   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, it is my  privilege
to stand in for hon Mrs Nkabinde who is indisposed. The  UDM  supports  this
amending Bill. The principle motivation for  the  amending  Bill  before  us
today is the fact that section 32 of the Occupational Diseases in Mines  and
Works Act of 1973 has not been amended since its enactment.

Section 32 of the principal Act determines that the director can refuse  any
application for medical examination with a view to seeking compensation  for
diseases listed in the Act if the applicant underwent a medical  examination
within six months before the director receives such an application.

In the past 29 years,  however,  World  Health  Organisation  guidelines  on
public health surveillance, as well  as  International  Labour  Organisation
standards have indicated that the period of six months provided for  in  the
principal Act is too short; therefore it is necessary to extend this  period
to 24 months.

Two reasons have been advanced for the extension to 24  months  with  regard
to medical examination for compensatable diseases. The  first  is  the  slow
progression of these compensatable diseases. The second reason  advanced  is
the use of X-rays to determine the degree  and  extent  of  a  compensatable
disease in a patient. Frequent exposure to X-rays by applicants, as  implied
under the six months prescription, could have a detrimental effect  on  such
a person's health.

The amending Bill before us also contains amendments that will  enhance  the
protection that employees in mines and works are entitled to,  and  as  such
it is a welcome and necessary edition to the framework of  legislation  that
protects and promotes occupational health. The UDM  supports  this  amending
Bill.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chaiperson, hon members, amendments to the almost  30-year-
old piece of legislation on occupational diseases in  mines  and  works  are
long overdue - however, better late than never.

The amendment of section 32(3) of the said Act puts  paid  to  the  inhumane
treatment that is meted out to people who work on the mines. It  has  to  be
borne in mind that in most cases such workers are ordered to strip  down  to
their natural outfits for  examination  and  follow  one  after  the  other,
without due regard to  the  different  age  groups.  We  welcome  that  such
examination will be done after two years. However, we call for the  exercise
to be performed in a humane and dignified manner befitting people.

We in the UCDP are opposed  to  dishonesty  and  welcome  whatever  punitive
steps may be taken against those who attempt  to  misrepresent  and  conceal
any information that is required to ensure good health in the workplace.  We
also welcome the amendment that makes it mandatory for owners of  mines  and
any controlled works to compensate people who  contract  diseases  while  in
their employ.

This legislation will ensure that we do not have cases of  people  suffering
from lung diseases such as mesothelioma or asbestosis  while  mining  houses
continue to send them from pillar to post instead of compensating  them,  as
is the case with Cape PLC.

Unscrupulous service providers, be they lawyers or whoever, have  to  be  on
the lookout. They need to know that surcharging people in dire need of  help
is not only unethical; it is also  punishable  by  law.  We  hope  that  the
amendments will help do away with the greed of  some  lawyers  and  doctors.
Our people should learn to get fulfilment in what they do and be  passionate
in rendering service to the disadvantaged without looking forward to gain.

The UCDP supports the Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, those hard at work within our mines and  other
works are exposed to harsh circumstances in terms of health  conditions  and
activities that may be detrimental to one's health. Just recently  the  news
focused on the high number of affected persons and deaths  as  a  result  of
asbestos plants. These were just persons  in  neighbouring  areas  to  these
sites. What about the persons working on these sites?

Miners have to travel into tunnels and  to  depths  in  mines  that  pose  a
danger to their health and life. These workers belong to our  citizenry.  We
have a duty to protect them, as enshrined in the Bill of Rights. We have  to
administer these principles and ensure that human rights in our country  are
upheld. One of the sections of the Bill of Rights refers to health.

Africa is rich in mineral wealth, and we have a team of  brave  people  hard
at work to recover and find this. It is our duty in turn to ensure that  the
good health and safety of these parties are well  protected.  The  MF  notes
that occupational diseases are a rising  problem  within  this  sector,  and
supports this amending Bill fully in administering the process. [Applause.]

Dr A N LUTHULI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, I shall speak  on
the Bill to amend the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act of  1973,
referred to as the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Amendment  Bill,
2002. This Bill is supportive of the Mine Health  and  Safety  Act  of  1998
already in existence in the Department of Minerals and Energy.

The Mine Health and Safety Act provides that employees must undergo an  exit
medical examination before or as  soon  as  possible  after  termination  of
employment. The exit certificate thus obtained forms the basis for a  future
compensation claim.

The Bill provides for four  amendments.  However,  I  will  only  deal  with
three, because the fourth one is simply a technical issue.

The first amendment concerns  section  32(3)  of  the  principal  Act  which
refers to the frequency of medical examinations. The principal Act  provides
that a director may refuse  an  application  if  the  person  concerned  was
medically examined within a period of six months prior to the date on  which
such an application is received, unless  the  application  is  supported  in
writing by a medical practitioner.

The amendment extends the period from six  to  12  months.  The  reason  for
extending  the  period  is  that   compensatable   diseases,   which   cover
pneumoconiosis, platinioses  -  that  is  platinum  salt  excess  -  and  TB
associated with pneumoconosis, amongst others,  progress  slowly.  This  may
not show at all or may not reflect progress at six-month intervals, even  on
X-rays. The other reason is that frequent X-ray use carries a health risk.

The second amendment  concerns  section  36A  of  the  principal  Act.  This
section currently provides that the owner of  a  controlled  mine  or  works
shall, for a period of not  more  than  two  years  from  the  date  of  the
commencement of a compensatable disease, pay the  reasonable  cost  incurred
by or on behalf of a person in his or her service, or who was in his or  her
service at the  commencement  of  a  compensatable  disease  in  respect  of
medical aid necessitated by such disease. The Act states that  the  employer
is only responsible for  paying  the  medical  bills  for  two  years.  What
happens thereafter? The Act also refers to reasonable costs. It is  left  to
the discretion of the employer to decide what  is  reasonable  and  what  is
not. That was not at all in the interests of the workers.

The amendment states that, firstly, any person who works or has worked at  a
mine or works, or any other person acting on behalf of such  a  person,  may
at any time apply to the director  for  a  medical  examination  of  such  a
person, for the purpose of determining whether such a  person  is  suffering
from a compensatable disease, or, if he has  previously  been  found  to  be
suffering from such a disease, the degree of such a  disease.  The  two-year
period has been altered to read that at  any  time  such  a  person  can  be
subjected to examination.
Secondly, the Bill also amends that  section  of  the  principal  Act  which
refers to paying for the reasonable costs incurred.  The  Bill  states  that
the  owner  of  a  controlled  mine  or  works  shall,  from  the  date   of
commencement of a compensatable  disease,  pay  the  legitimate  and  proven
costs incurred. We are saying ``proven costs'' because there  will  have  to
be some evidence that in fact the  miner  did  incur  some  costs,  such  as
accommodation, travelling and meals wherever they had to go to get  such  an
examination. They would have to keep receipts, which  is  what  we  mean  by
``proven costs.'' And by ``legitimate'' we mean  that  has  to  be  for  the
reason of going to find out whether in fact there is a lung disease or not.

This removes the two-year limit that is imposed by  current  legislation  on
the liability of the owner of the controlled mines or works. The  effect  of
the removal of this two-year limitation is that the liability of  the  owner
of a controlled mine or works in respect of the legitimate and  proven  cost
of medical aid will be unlimited.

The third amendment concerns section 124(1) of the principal Act.  Currently
section 121(1) determines two acts that shall cause a person  to  be  guilty
of an offence. The amendment  inserts  an  additional  paragraph  (c)  which
determines that a person who, in exchange for services claiming any  benefit
of this Act, charges a fee of more  than  half  a  percent  of  the  benefit
awarded to a claimant for his  or  her  services,  shall  be  guilty  of  an
offence. This amendment has been necessitated by  the  fact  that  so-called
commissioners, community representatives and attorneys, by assisting  people
in claiming such benefits in terms of the Act, end up  taking  the  bulk  of
compensation money awarded to the claimants.

In conclusion, I want to say that this  legislation  is  a  commitment  once
more by our Government to ensuring that our people do  not  continue  to  be
victims of predators because they are  poor  and  ignorant.  Once  more  the
unions must help our Government in ensuring that this  legislation  is  seen
to  be  implemented.  The  unions  must  press  for  effective  preventative
measures to be accorded each  and  every  miner  as,  once  acquired,  these
diseases are incurable.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I would like to thank  the  members  of
the portfolio committee  and  the  different  parties  for  supporting  this
amending Bill. These are urgent implementable amendments.  I  heard  hon  Dr
Rabinowitz'  complaint   that   there   are   contradictions   between   the
Occupational Diseases in Mines  and  Works  Act  and  the  Compensation  for
Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act. The latter is actually  administered
by the Department of Labour.

I thought we had discussed this with her, that in fact in 1999 cabinet  took
a decision that we needed to rationalise this legislation.  She  knows  this
is work in progress  and  very  soon  we  will  see  the  removal  of  these
contradictions, but we had to amend this Act because we think these  changes
are very implementable and very urgent in terms of  trying  to  address  the
plight of former miners, as well as current miners.  I  do  not  think  that
should be a real problem for her because she knows  that  this  is  work  in
progress and it is being attended to.

She neither supported nor opposed the Bill. I do not know on which side  the
IFP stands, but in the portfolio committee the member  did  not  oppose  the
Bill. I suppose that is still the stand of IFP, that it supports  the  Bill,
because she did not mention whether they support or  oppose  the  Bill  when
she made her speech.

Regarding the other issue that was  raised,  I  think  by  the  UCDP,  about
medical examinations, let me briefly say that these are indeed done  in  the
privacy of consultation rooms and the health facilities  of  the  Department
of Health. We try to do them as confidentially as is humanly possible.

There was also a comment that  perhaps  we  are  not  quite  addressing  the
issues in the rural areas. Let me assure the members of Parliament  that  we
are indeed trying to extend these services to the rural areas as well.

The  national  Department  of  Health  is  working   with   the   provincial
Departments of Health on this matter so  that  we  can  extend  the  benefit
medical examinations to the provinces as  well.  We  consider  this  a  very
important exercise. As  we  said  at  the  beginning,  we  are  the  elected
representatives of our people, and we have to represent  them  in  the  best
way that we can in an effort to improve the quality of care that we give  to
our people.

As members can see, the amendments that  have  been  put  before  the  House
today are really an effort on our side to improve the health care system  so
that it delivers efficient and quality health care to our  people.  I  thank
members for listening to us and for supporting us  on  the  two  amendments.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
The House adjourned at 17:29.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government
     on the Local Government Laws Amendment Bill [B  61  -  2002]  (National
     Assembly - sec 75), dated 22 October 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government,  having
         considered the subject of the Local Government Laws Amendment  Bill
         [B 61 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec  75),  referred  to  it  and
         classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as  a  section  75  Bill,
         reports the Bill with amendments [B 61A - 2002].


         The Committee reports further, as follows:


         1. The Committee feels  that  it  is  unacceptable  that  the  Bill
              should have been introduced to Parliament so late and that the
              Committee should have had a limited time in which  to  process
              it. However, as the Bill dealt  mainly  with  minor  technical
              amendments, the Committee was able to apply its  usual  rigour
              to the  Bill,  particularly  in  respect  of  the  substantive
              clauses, and has been able to complete the processing  of  the
              Bill within the timeframes decided  upon.  Despite  this,  the
              Committee would have preferred to receive  the  Bill  earlier,
              and urges the Ministry and the Department  of  Provincial  and
              Local Government to avoid a recurrence of this.
         2. The Committee acknowledges the need to extend  the  transitional
              period relating to the MECs' authorisations of the division of
              powers and functions between District and Local Municipalities
              from 5 December 2002 to 30 June 2003. The Committee feels that
              it is important that consideration be given, in  the  division
              of  powers  and   functions   between   District   and   Local
              Municipalities, to:


              *   Alignment of publication  of  notices  of  the  Minister's
                authorisation of the four "national"  powers  and  functions
                and MECs' publication of notices of the adjustments  of  the
                remaining powers and functions.  The  publication  of  these
                notices takes place by no later than the end of January 2003
                in order to give municipalities adequate time to prepare and
                to budget accordingly.


              *   Alignment, over time, of the Minister's authorisations  of
                powers and functions and MECs' adjustments of  these  powers
                and functions.


              *   Review of the  Minister's  authorisations  and  the  MECs'
                adjustments, over time, to ensure that  the  important  role
                allocated to  District  Municipalities  in  legislation  and
                policy is fulfilled.


         3. The Committee was careful to ensure that the clauses seeking  to
              validate the Cape  Valuation  Ordinance  are  of  a  technical
              nature.  They  are  necessary  to  ensure  that  the   current
              valuations of municipalities  in  the  Western,  Northern  and
              Eastern Cape are legally valid.


         4. Related to the issue of validating the Cape Valuation  Ordinance
              is the dispute between the Cape Town metro  municipality,  the
              Rates Action Group and the Robertsons. While it is  the  right
              of the parties to dispute  or  to  pursue  legal  action,  the
              Committee feels that all the parties  in  the  dispute  should
              seek to  resolve  their  differences  through  discussion  and
              negotiations.  It  is  regrettable  that  a  section  of   the
              ratepayers is exploiting an unfortunate technical loophole  as
              the  basis  for  its  legal  action  against  the  Cape   Town
              Municipality  to  address  its  concerns  over   the   current
              equitable valuations  and  rates  policy  of  Cape  Town.  The
              Committee feels that  these  ratepayers'  concerns  about  the
              current equitable valuations and the  rates  policy  might  be
              more usefully served by engaging with the municipality on  the
              current valuations and substance of the rates policy. In  this
              context it is  desirable  for  aggrieved  parties  to  utilise
              appropriate objection and appeal procedures. If the effect  of
              the current valuations of the Cape Town  Municipality  results
              in an undue financial burden for any category  of  ratepayers,
              the municipality needs to explore, through its  rates  policy,
              whether there is anything that it can do to provide relief  to
              those ratepayers.


         5. In processing  the  clause  dealing  with  the  remuneration  of
              councillors,  the  Committee  noted  that  municipalities  are
              providing  allowances   and   benefits   to   councillors   in
              contravention of the Remuneration  of  Public  Office  Bearers
              Act, 1998. Many of these  municipalities  purport  to  provide
              these  in  terms  of  provisions   contained   in   provincial
              ordinances, but these provincial ordinances have had no  legal
              effect since the enactment of the Remuneration of  the  Public
              Office Bearers Act. The Committee recognises that councillors'
              salaries  and  allowances  need  to  be  adequate,   but   the
              dissatisfaction  of  municipalities  around  this  should   be
              negotiated  through  the  appropriate  channels.  The  present
              practice of transgressing the Remuneration  of  Public  Office
              Bearers Act is unacceptable, and the Committee urges that:


              *   The Ministry and the Department of  Provincial  and  Local
                Government take steps to stop this practice.


              *   The MECs for local government act more decisively  against
                these transgressions.


              *   The Ministry and the Department of  Provincial  and  Local
                Government seek to  have  the  relevant  provisions  of  the
                provincial ordinances repealed as soon as possible.


              *   The Committee Chairperson send a copy of this part of  the
                Report to the Ministry and the Department of Provincial  and
                Local Government and  the  MECs  for  local  government  and
                request them to act expeditiously.


         6. The Committee feels that  the  negotiations  with  the  relevant
              stakeholders on the Property Rates Bill  should  be  completed
              reasonably soon and that that Bill  should  be  introduced  in
              Parliament next year.

         A. Terms of reference


              The Committee visited Consani Engineering in order to:


              *   Examine the level of compliance with  occupational  health
                and safety standards in the workplace


              *   Obtain information on the accident rate


              *   Gain insight into the procedures relating to inspections


              *   Gain exposure to various workshops and working  conditions
                related to them.


         B. Background


              The multi-party delegation consisted of 10 members:


              Ms E Thabethe  ANC (Acting Chairperson)
              Ms T E Lishivha      ANC
              Mr D D Mabuza  ANC
              Ms H F Malebana      ANC
              Mr S A Mshudulu      ANC
              Mr M J G Mzondeki    ANC
              Mr G G Oliphant      ANC
              Mr N van Wyk   ANC
              Mr N S Middleton     IFP
              Mr M N Ramodike      UDM


              Mr G Matloporo, Ministry of Labour; Mr T Ngonyama,  Provincial
              Executive  Manager:  Western  Cape;  Mr  T  Bailey,   Manager:
              Inspectorate and Enforcement Services, Western Cape; and Ms  N
              Nonkelela, Committee Secretary, accompanied the delegation.


         C. Procedure
              The  Committee  requested  the  Department  of   Labour   (the
              Department) to  arrange  a  visit  to  a  suitable  workplace.
              Consani Engineering was selected as it was a high-risk plant.


              Before departing, the delegation was escorted to the  regional
              office of the Department in Barrack Street, Cape Town, where a
              Mr Ngonyama and a Mr Bailey  briefed  the  delegation  on  the
              background of Consani Engineering.


              The delegation was informed that inspectors usually  inform  a
              company  of  their  intention  to  conduct   inspections.   An
              unannounced visit is undertaken only  after  a  complaint  has
              been lodged.


              Then the delegation departed for the plant in Elsies River.


         D. Findings


              Consani Engineering was established  in  1929  by  an  Italian
              family. It was taken over by Murray  and  Roberts  during  the
              1990s, and is in the process  of  integrating  all  the  other
              factories under its control.


              Consani Engineering is in the business of making  three  types
              of tanks:


              *   Standard tanks for storing multiple products


              *   Special tanks for maintaining the temperature of a product


              *   Gas tanks for storing dioxide products.


              The plant is classified as a high-risk plant.


              Institutional mission


              The mission of the plant is divided  into  values  and  goals.
              Values include looking after the company's interest,  enjoying
              the work, assisting others where necessary and supporting  the
              mission. Goals include guarding against  negligence,  striving
              to be on time and leaving the area clean.


              Inspections


              The plant engineer briefed the delegation on matters  relating
              to  inspections.  The  number  of  inspectors   inspecting   a
              particular site is dependent on the number of people they need
              to consult. For example, if an  entire  company  needs  to  be
              inspected, four or five inspectors will be present.


              Inspection procedures


              *   Inspectors are furnished with the relevant documents after
                a complaint has been lodged


              *   The employer appoints an investigator


              *   Health and  safety  inspectors  meet  with  the  company's
                safety committee


              *   Inspectors make recommendations to the employer


              *   Two  checklists  are  used  -  the  information  checklist
                contains inspection guidelines and the requirement checklist
                contains  the  standard  at  which  inspections  should   be
                conducted


              *   During an investigation three notices may be issued:


                - A contravention notice is  issued  when  an  employer  has
                  contravened an Act


                - An improvement  notice  is  issued  when  an  employer  is
                  notified to improve the conditions of employment


                - A prohibition notice is issued when a situation  is  life-
                  threatening  and  prohibits  an  employee  from  using   a
                  certain machine until it is repaired


              *   An employer has 60 days within which to  comply  with  the
                regulations. If a matter is very serious, a follow-up notice
                is served. If the employer still fails to comply, the matter
                is handed over for prosecution.


              Safety committee


              The plant engineer is the chairperson of the safety committee.
              The committee meets every  three  months  and  considers  only
              issues of safety.  The  forepersons  from  each  workshop  are
              members of the committee.


              Unions


              Three unions are represented at the plant:


              *   National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA)


              *   National E Trade Union (NETU)


              *   Metal Workers Union (MWU).


              The plant manager is chairperson of the MWU.


              Injuries


              During April 2002 there were 27 minor injuries (scratches  and
              bruises) and three major injuries (back injuries and  loss  of
              eyesight).


              Some injuries resulted from pressure due  to  workload.  Other
              injuries were caused  by  negligence.  There  were  50  safety
              representatives at the plant.


              Sheet metal workshop


              Workers in this section make metal boxes, and it  is  a  noisy
              zone. The workshop consists of 15 to  20  workers  working  on
              shifts  and  supervised  by  a  foreperson.  Inspections   are
              conducted on a monthly basis and recommendations are submitted
              to the safety committee.


              Tank workshop


              Workers in this section make dish plates. One worker  lost  an
              arm while operating  a  machine,  and  the  matter  was  under
              investigation.


              Spin workshop


              The workshop has two  forepersons.  Three  injuries  (loss  of
              limbs)  were  recorded  during  May  2002.  All  injuries  are
              registered, no matter how minor.


              Component workshop


              Workers in this section make frames which are supplied to  all
              the other worshops at the plant. It is also a noisy zone.


              Durban workshop


              Workers  in  this  section  assemble  tanks.  The   delegation
              observed a female worker working here.


              Clearing workshop
              Workers work on shifts in  this  workshop.  African  employees
              told the delegation that  bureaucracy  still  existed  in  the
              workshop, since their complaints were  delayed  in  favour  of
              white and coloured employees.


              They  also  said  that  white  and  coloured  employees   were
              allocated overtime.  Injuries  occurred  mostly  due  to  torn
              clothing and broken shoes.


              Interaction with workers and HR manager


              As far as workers were concerned, the management  delayed  the
              replacement of worn safety clothes. One worker said  it  might
              take two months to replace an overall.


              One worker whose eyesight  was  adversely  affected  while  on
              duty, claimed that he was not aware of what  compensation  was
              due to him. Another worker claimed that safety representatives
              did not always accurately reflect workers' views.


              Workers said they were unhappy about transport to their  homes
              at night, especially in view of incidents  of  gangsterism  in
              the area.


              Some workers also indicated that they had been casual  workers
              for more than two years.


              As far as the HR manager was concerned,  the  HIV/Aids  policy
              could  not  be  implemented  because  workers  were  not   co-
              operative. He  requested  the  Committee  to  assist  in  this
              regard.


              Employees with disabilities  were  not  retained  due  to  the
              nature of the plant's operations. They were granted leave  and
              disability pensions, and were not  trained  in  skills  needed
              outside the company.
              Theft and substance abuse were serious problems. A policy  was
              in place  to  provide  counselling  and  support  services  to
              persons affected by substance abuse.


              Occupational health  and  safety  training  was  conducted  at
              various levels within the company.


         E. Concluding remarks


              The  delegation  expresses  its  appreciation  for  the   warm
              reception it received for the duration of its visit at Consani
              Engineering. It also wishes to thank the  Cape  Town  regional
              office of the Department for taking  care  of  the  logistical
              arrangements, as well as the inspectors who assisted  to  make
              the visit informative and worthwhile.


              After presenting  its  findings  and  recommendations  to  the
              National  Assembly,  the  Committee  will  liaise   with   the
              Department to ensure that the concerns raised  are  addressed.
              The Committee will  also  ensure  that  important  aspects  of
              health and  safety,  namely  training  programmes  on  health,
              receive attention.


              Furthermore, the Committee intends:


              *   Following up on matters raised by  workers,  such  as  the
                delay in the replacement of safety clothes


              *   Meeting with safety representatives on matters  raised  by
                workers who are not well-represented


              *   Assisting in solving problems related to implementing  the
                HIV/Aids policy,  perhaps  by  sending  someone  to  address
                workers.


         F. Recommendations
              The Committee recommends that:


              *   The Department and the company set aside  a  day  to  meet
                with the health and safety committee


              *   The provincial department of labour make the reports  from
                the inspectorate available to  the  Committee.  A  composite
                update on the inspection of Consani Engineering must also be
                made available


              *   Outstanding cases be followed up


              *   Durable gloves be made available for workers


              *   Structured training programmes on  health  and  safety  be
                examined by the Department


              *   Recommendations emanating from the  safety  committee,  as
                well as  minutes  of  previous  meetings,  be  acquired  and
                monitored by the Department.


     Report to be considered.
