                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms S C VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, I give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the rand has gained about  19%  against  the  dollar  this
       year, making it the world's best performing currency;


  (2) recognises that the gaining of strength is due to  multiple  factors,
       including confidence in our economy and in our prospects  for  growth
       and development;


  (3) further recognises that this confidence is strengthened by the bumper
       trade surpluses in February and March,  helping  the  country  to  an
       impressive trade balance of R10,4 billion in the first quarter;


  (4) congratulates the Government, in particular the Ministers of  Finance
       and  of  Trade  and  Industry,  for  their  outstanding  success   in
       transforming the economy of our country; and


  (5) calls on all those who stand whining on the  sidelines  to  take  off
       their cloaks of doom and gloom and to instead celebrate  with  us  in
       our transformation to democracy and  prosperity,  facing  up  to  the
       massive challenges that face our country with commitment and joy.

[Applause.]

Mr J SELFE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:

       announcements and measures;

       that the DA is here to stay; and


  (4) warns politicians who were given a mandate in December  2000  by  the
       local government voters that they turn their backs on the  people  at
       their peril.

[Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that according to one of the findings of a study conducted last
       year by the University of Cape Town's Institute  of  Criminology  and
       the Medical Research Council, verbal abuse of health care workers  in
       hospitals across Cape Town is a major concern;


  (2) further notes  that  61%  of  the  health  care  workers  interviewed
       ``frequently'' had to deal with threats and verbal insults; and


  (3) calls upon the public to -


       (a)  exercise restraint and to understand that  health  care  workers
           perform under a lot of pressure and stress; and


       (b)  desist from making the job of health care workers more difficult
           than it is by directing abuse and threats at them.

Mrs B TINTO: Chair, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Cobus Cronjé, a Cape Town  businessman  and  inventor  who
       grew up in modest circumstances, has concluded a R450 million deal to
       make and export a vehicle exhaust device of his own invention;
  (2) believes that it is such innovative ideas and  entrepreneurship  that
       will  bring  South  Africa  to   the   forefront   of   international
       competitiveness;


  (3) commends Mr Cronjé's plans to open a centre to assist people with new
       inventions to develop prototypes and to patent new products; and


  (4) congratulates Mr Cronjé on his outstanding achievement.

[Applause.]

Mr A BLAAS: Chair, I give notice that I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the alarming shortage of  money  necessary  for  the  effective
       functioning of the Defence Force, therefore causing -


       (a)  equipment to be neglected to such  an  extent  that  it  becomes
           unreliable and poses a threat to human lives;


       (b)   a  shortage  of  skills,  human  resources  and  the  loss   of
           technicians and pilots due to a lack of flying time;


       (c)  a trend which, if continued, will put the  Defence  Force  in  a
           position of being unable to fulfil its mandate;


       (d)  incidents of theft, fraud  and  irregularities  to  become  more
           frequent;


       (e)  the Navy to pirate from serviceable vessels  to  maintain  other
           vessels; and


       (f)  the morale and availability of the reserve forces to deteriorate
           because logistical support and equipment are unavailable; and


  (2) calls on the Cabinet Committee on Safety and Security to  investigate
       the possibility of allocating more money to the Defence Force  or  to
       revisit assignments allocated to the Defence Force.

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Honourable Chair, I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Constitutional Court yesterday ruled on section 49  of
       the Criminal Procedure Act;


  (2) thanks the Constitutional Court for the obvious effort it applied  to
       clearly and unambiguously explain its ruling,  and  hopes  that  this
       contributes to clarification on the use of lethal force;


  (3) urges the Minister for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  to
       immediately draft a new section  49,  taking  on  board  the  express
       guidelines that were laid down by the Constitutional Court  in  order
       to once and for all end the confusion created by the existence of two
       different versions of section 49; and


  (4)  calls  on  the  Minister  of  Safety  and  Security  to  immediately
       communicate clear and concise guidelines  and  to  launch  retraining
       programmes, if necessary to all members of the SAPS  to  ensure  that
       the life-threatening confusion that has existed until now is  cleared
       up.

[Applause.]

Mr P J GOMOMO: Hon Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President George Bush  Junior  has  refused  to  lift  the
       United States trade embargo against Cuba;
  (2) further notes that this embargo is  based  on  ideology  rather  than
       matters of principle on the part of the United States, which  remains
       quiet about human rights abuses in  countries  whose  governments  it
       supports; and


  (3) calls on the United States not to abuse  its  power  as  the  world's
       wealthiest nation with the largest economy  at  the  expense  of  the
       people who inhabit a tiny neighbouring state.

[Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, I shall move as follows:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the new chairman  of  the  traditional  leaders,  Nkosi
       Mpiyezintombi Mzimela, and  wishes  him  success  in  this  important
       position;


  (2) observes that the status and authority of the traditional leaders  is
       vaguely stated in the Constitution;


  (3) appeals to the ANC Government to revisit sections 211 and 212 of  the
       Constitution so that the status, role and  authority  of  traditional
       leaders can be stated in a more meaningful manner  which  befits  the
       status of African royalty, and truly recognises  the  institution  of
       African royalty in our country; and


  (4) notes the PAC view that genuine traditional leaders are custodians of
       African culture and customary law and that there can  be  no  African
       restoration without retrieving lost African glory.

Dr C P MULDER: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat die nuwe Springbok-rugbyafrigter, Rudolf Straeuli, sy
       groep van 22 spelers aangewys het vir die eerste toets teen Wallis;


  (2) die afrigter, sy bestuurspan en die spelers sterkte toewens  met  die
       kragmetings wat teen onder andere Wallis, Australië  en  Nieu-Seeland
       voorlê;


  (3) Straeuli en sy keurders gelukwens met die moed wat hulle aan die  dag
       gelê het om 'n betreklike jong en onervare span op grond van  meriete
       saam te stel, en hoop dat meriete deurgaans die norm sal wees by  die
       kies van spanne; en


  (4) 'n beroep doen op Sarvu om sy huis  in  orde  te  kry  en  behoorlike
       langtermynsekuriteit aan talentvolle  spelers  te  verskaf,  wat  sal
       verhoed dat hulle die land verlaat om vir buitelandse klubs  te  gaan
       speel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)
[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note that the new Springbok rugby coach, Rudolf  Straeuli,  has
       selected his group of 22 players for the first test against Wales;


  (2) wishes the coach, his management team and the players  everything  of
       the best for the  upcoming  tests  against,  amongst  others,  Wales,
       Australia and New Zealand;


  (3) congratulates  Straeuli  and  his  selectors  for  the  courage  they
       displayed in putting together a fairly young and  inexperienced  team
       on the basis of merit, and hopes that  merit  will  remain  the  norm
       throughout when teams are selected; and


  (4) appeals to Sarfu to get its house in order and to provide proper long-
       term security for talented players, which  would  prevent  them  from
       leaving the country to play for clubs abroad.]

Miss M N MAGAZI: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Johannesburg High Court handed down multiple life  sentences
           to Bruma Lake serial killers Simon Majola and Themba Nkosi; and


       (b)  members of the SAPS worked tirelessly to ensure that the duo was
           brought to book;


  (2) congratulates the Johannesburg High Court on an appropriate  sentence
       meted out to these criminals;


  (3) commends the SAPS for investigating and bringing  these  criminal  to
       book; and


  (4) calls on the communities to work with the police to  ensure  that  we
       fight crime and that our people live in a secure environment.
[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the headline inflation rate for April 2002 is 8,0% and that this
           rate is the highest since February 1999;


       (b)  the CPIX increased by 0,8% for April, moving further out of  the
           inflation target range and now stands at 8,8%; and


       (c)  inflationary pressures continue  to  cause  hardship  for  South
           Africans who have to  feed,  house,  transport  and  ensure  the
           health and wellbeing of their families;


  (2) expresses its concern at the continued after-effects of the  dramatic
       depreciation of the rand in the fourth quarter of 2001  on  inflation
       despite the possible ameliorating impact of the recent rand  strength
       primarily on the back of dollar weakness; and


  (3) calls on all role-players to co-ordinate their efforts to ensure that
       inflationary pressures are curtailed.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns the incident in which two houses vacated due to evictions by
       banks were burnt down in  Mandela  Park  in  Khayelitsha  after  bank
       representatives from the  NBS,  Standard  Bank  and  Servcon  Housing
       Company failed to attend a meeting called  by  residents  to  address
       evictions in the area;


  (2) regrets that such evictions  occurred  through  nonpayment  of  bonds
       because of the shoddy construction  work,  but  recognises  that  the
       occupants were merely making a statement after their complaints  fell
       on deaf ears from both the banks and the construction company;


  (3) does not condone nonpayment for  services  rendered,  but  wishes  to
       register that shoddy work is in violation of a contract  between  the
       service provider and the receiver of such service;


  (4) calls upon the banks and construction companies to be civil with  the
       complainants and to give attention to consumer complaints; and


  (5) wishes to solicit the support of the Minister of Housing to intervene
       in the matter to prevent further destruction of property ...

[Time expired.]

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports of increased tensions between India and  Pakistan  over
       Kashmir;


  (2) believes that it is mostly unarmed civilians, women and  children  in
       particular, who are subjected to human rights abuse in situations  of
       all wars and terrorists' activities;


  (3) calls on the two countries in  the  spirit  of  coexistence  to  work
       towards a peaceful resolution of their conflicts; and


  (4) further calls on the international community to make efforts to avert
       war between these two countries and, in  keeping  with  international
       law, to make sure that the territorial integrity of both countries is
       respected.

[Applause.]

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Geagte Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek  op  die  volgende
sittingsdag gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die Minister van Handel en Nywerheid se versoek ten volle  steun  dat
       die kwotastelsel soos  vervat  in  die  voorgestelde  Wetsontwerp  op
       Immigrasie geskrap word;


  (2) meen dat die kwotastelsel die toelating van hoogs  geskoolde  persone
       sal belemmer; en


  (3) ook van mening  is  dat  die  afskaffing  van  die  kwotastelsel  sal
       meebring dat  mense  met  broodnodige  kundigheid  die  stimulus  sal
       verskaf om ekonomiese ontwikkeling te bevorder en werkgeleenthede  te
       skep.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Hon Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) fully supports the request by the Minister of Trade and Industry that
       the quota system as contained in the  proposed  Immigration  Bill  be
       removed;


  (2) is of the opinion that the quota system would hamper the admission of
       highly trained people; and


  (3) is also of the opinion that the removal of  the  quota  system  would
       result in people with essential expertise providing the  stimulus  to
       promote economic development and create job opportunities.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the UDM at the next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the son of the  Deputy  Minister  of  Minerals  and  Energy  was
           recently expelled from his school for setting off a  smoke  bomb
           on school premises that injured 10 pupils;


       (b)  this expulsion was overturned by the Gauteng MEC for  Education,
           without consulting the school governing body; and


       (c)  the ANC in Gauteng defended the MEC's decision;


  (2) calls on the Government to ensure that its interaction  with  schools
       is even-handed and fair, and that special attention is  paid  to  the
       legal and democratic role that school governing bodies  are  entitled
       to play.

Miss J E SOSIBO: Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a pool of foreign and local investors has spent R7 million
       to light up KwaMpungose, a rural KwaZulu-Natal community, as part  of
       a world-first commercial project  to  supply  low-priced  electricity
       using sustainable fuel cell technology;
  (2) believes that this project will contribute positively  to  the  rural
       renewal programme and sustainable livelihoods in rural areas; and


  (3) commends the Alternative Energy Development Corporation for embarking
       on this important initiative.

        DISESTABLISHMENT OF SOUTH AFRICAN HOUSING TRUST LIMITED BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Chairperson and hon  members,  the  Bill  which  we
have before the House represents the  end  of  a  chapter  of  a  government
intervention which began during 1986 when the  government  and  the  private
sector, under the leadership of the late  Dr  Fred  du  Plessis  of  Sanlam,
agreed that the country was faced with two major  crises,  namely,  lack  of
housing with ownership for the lower income segment  of  the  South  African
population, and unemployment.

Following discussions between the then government and  the  private  sector,
it was agreed  that  a  joint  venture  should  be  established  outside  of
government  so  as  to   create   employment   opportunities   through   the
facilitation and funding of housing directed at the lower-income segment  of
the South African  population.  For  this  purpose,  the  SA  Housing  Trust
Limited was established in January  of  1987  with  its  main  business  and
purpose stated as follows, and I quote:


  To promote  and  facilitate  the  provision  of  affordable  shelter  and
  security of tenure to the  lower  income  earning  communities  of  South
  Africa in a way which will maximise job creation.

Since its establishment, the business  of  the  company  evolved  through  a
number of phases. These phases reflect the impact of  and  adjustments  made
by the management of the company in relation  to  changes  in  the  external
environment from time to time. Two wholly owned subsidiaries of the  company
were established, namely, Nu-Way  Housing  Developments  (Pty)  Limited  and
Khayalethu Home Loans (Pty) Limited, which respectively house  the  property
development business and the home loan business of the group.

On incorporation, the company issued  10 000  ordinary  shares  with  a  par
value of R1 each to  various  institutions.  Simultaneously  therewith,  the
government provided an interest free loan of R445  million  to  the  company
and undertook to guarantee loans raised in the private sector to  an  amount
of R890  million.  During  the  1993-94  financial  year,  the  government's
interest-free loan of R445 million was converted into share capital  by  the
issue of one Class A ordinary shares with a par value of R1 and issue  at  a
premium of R444,9 million. This Class A  ordinary  share  ranks  pari  passu
with all other ordinary shared in the authorised and issued  shared  capital
of the company, save that the holder thereof shall on a  winding-up  of  the
company, whether voluntarily or compulsorily, be entitled to  a  liquidation
dividend after all the creditors of the company have been paid in  full  and
in priority to the ordinary shareholders, equal to the aggregate of the  par
value of such share and the share premium attached thereto.

The aforesaid  capitalisation  had  the  effect  of  improving  the  capital
structure of the company and geared the company appropriately so as to  grow
its business substantially. In addition to the  above,  during  the  1992-93
financial year, the government made a nonrefundable grant of R40 million  to
the company.

The delay in profitability of stand sales together with the  bond  repayment
boycotts by home owners severely hampered the growth  of  the  company.  The
company had substantial accumulated losses for each year from 1995 to 1998.

The Government and the directors of the company came to the conclusion  that
the likelihood of the company successfully trading out of  its  difficulties
was remote and that the company's operations  should  be  restructured.  The
Government approved the  restructuring  during  March  1998  and  agreed  to
honour all  guarantees  which  it  had  issued.  It  also  agreed  that  the
subsidiaries - Nu-Way and Khayalethu - and  businesses  of  the  company  be
sold as going concerns for the best prices available and that  any  proceeds
therefrom be applied towards settling the liabilities of the group.

During 1999 and 2000, the  company  sold  Nu-Way  and  Khayalethu  with  the
approval of the Cabinet. Cabinet also agreed that steps should be  taken  to
disestablish the company. The winding-down process has taken place with  the
knowledge and consent of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts  of  the
National Assembly. After the sale of the two subsidiaries,  the  liabilities
of the company amount to R571 million, which has  been  transferred  to  the
Government.

The  assets  of  the  company  that  remain  after  the  sale  of  the   two
subsidiaries amount to approximately R70 million, which consists  mainly  of
loans to various housing corporations of the former TVBC states.  Government
has agreed that the company should transfer its assets of approximately  R70
million to the National Housing Finance Corporation,  wholly  owned  by  the
Government, for a nominal fee of R1. National  Treasury  became  responsible
for the serving and payment of the  debt  obligations  after  1  April  this
year.

As I speak, there are no employees of the SA Housing Trust Limited. All  the
employees of the company have either  moved  to  other  employment  or  been
redeployed in the companies which purchased Nu-Way Warehousing  Developments
and Khayalethu Home Loans. The only directors remaining, with the  exception
of the chairperson, are employees of the  state,  and  no  director  of  the
company has received or will  receive  any  benefit  other  than  a  nominal
director's remuneration.

The Bill seeks to disestablish the company from 1 April  this  year  through
clause 2(1). The Registrar of Companies  must  deregister  the  company,  in
terms of the Companies Act of 1973, from the effective date  through  clause
2(2). In terms of clause 3(a), all rights and assets  of  the  company  will
vest in the National Housing Finance Corporation, while all obligations  and
liabilities will vest in the Government  as  national  state  debt  and  the
Government becomes bound to meet these obligations and  liabilities  on  the
dates stipulated for compliance through clause 3(b). The  directors  of  the
company retire as directors as  from  the  effective  date,  through  clause
3(c).

In terms  of  clause  4(1),  payments  made  by  the  Government  after  the
effective  date  but  during  the  2002-03  financial  year  to   meet   the
obligations and  liabilities  referred  to  above  must  be  direct  charges
against the National Revenue Fund to the extent that such payment cannot  be
defrayed  from  funds  appropriated  under   the   Housing   Vote   in   the
Appropriation Act. In subsequent years, payments by the  Government  of  any
of the company's obligations and liabilities are  a  direct  charge  against
the National Revenue Fund as if they were payments in connection with  loans
as contemplated in section 73 of the Public Finance Management Act of  1999,
in terms of clause 4(2).

After discussions between  the  Department  of  Housing  and  the  Portfolio
Committee on Housing, it was found necessary to  make  minor  amendments  to
the Bill, relating to the extension of the effective date from 1 April to  1
July this year, the extension of the date from which  the  National  Revenue
Fund takes over the liabilities of the company from 1 April 2001 to 1  April
2002 and the rewording  of  clause  4(2)  to  bring  the  repayment  of  the
company's future obligations and liabilities into line with  the  provisions
of the Public Finance Management Act of 1999. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 17:25.

     A.     Introduction


         A delegation representing the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Sport  and
         Recreation visited the Northern Cape province from  9  to  12  June
         2000. The purpose of the visit was to assess the progress  made  by
         the  provincial  department  with   regard   to   development   and
         transformation of sport in South Africa. The delegation  wanted  to
         understand  the  problems  and  challenges   experienced   by   the
         province.  The  Committee  also  wanted  to  assess  the  link  and
         congruence between the programme of the  provincial  department  of
         sport to the national vision on sport and recreation.


         The  delegation  representing  the   Committee   focused   on   the
         following:


         1. Availability of sports  facilities  to  all  communities,  which
              include the following:


              (a) Provision of sports facilities to  communities  that  were
                  previously disadvantaged.


              (b) Accessibility of sports  facilities  to  all  and  in  all
                  areas.


              (c)  Sensitivity  to  disabled  people  when  building  sports
                  facilities.


              (d) The level  of  standard  of  facilities  within  different
                  communities.


              (e) The ownership of sport facilities by communities.


              (f) The maintenance of facilities by both  the  community  and
                  the municipalities.


         2. Accessibility of all sports to all  communities,  including  the
              following:


              (a) The integration of all to sports, irrespective of race and
                  gender.


              (b) The representativity of previously disadvantaged people in
                  the provincial and  regional  teams  of  different  sports
                  codes.


              (c)  The  back-up  support  that   is   given   to   financial
                  disadvantaged  sports  people   who   are   selected   for
                  participation in national and international tournaments.


              (d) The promotion of the disabled  people's  participation  on
                  sport and recreation activities.


              (e) The recognition of deserving sports people as role  models
                  and  the  use  of  such  people  as  human  resources   by
                  communities.


              (f) The utilisation of sports  people  by  the  community  and
                  various structures in the programme of nation building.


         3. Sport Development Programmes, which are run in the province.


         4.  The  availability,  accessibility  and  impact  of  the  sports
              academies.


         5.  The  relationship  between  the  provincial   department,   the
              Standing  Committee  on  Sport  and   the   local   government
              structures.


         6. The relationship between the government departments, the  sports
              bodies and other role players in sport such  as  the  business
              sector.


         7. The role of the community on sports issues.

     D.     Welcoming by MEC


         On arrival in the Northern Cape, the  delegation  was  welcomed  at
         and collected from the Airport  by  the  late  MEC  for  Sport  and
         Culture, Mr Brian Hermanus, accompanied by Mr A Babuseng and Mr  Le
         Grange, officials of the department.


         The delegation was taken to the Northern Cape Legislative  Building
         in Kimberley and was officially welcomed by the chairperson of  the
         standing committee on sports and culture,  Mr  P  Tulase.  The  MEC
         briefed the delegation on the activities  of  his  department.  The
         delegation had an opportunity  to  view  a  video  cassette  of  an
         awards ceremony honouring previously unrecognised sports people.


         In his remarks the MEC said that they  were  a  province  at  work.
         Indeed this was something that was seen in the course of the  study
         tour, as key areas of the transformation programme were covered  in
         this province. The MEC  touched  on  a  programme  adopted  by  the
         provincial cabinet under the slogan  "Cabinet  meets  the  people",
         where the Cabinet goes out to and meets with  people  in  different
         districts, churches, businesses and  councils.  He  mentioned  that
         one of the  issues  raised  by  groupings,  in  sports  was  sports
         facilities. He appealed to the delegation to take up the  issue  of
         a contribution from the lottery towards sport. He also spoke  of  a
         programme in the Northern Cape intended to highlight and raise  the
         awareness of the community  about  the  consequences  of  crime  to
         young people under the slogan "a child in sport is a child  out  of
         jail".


         Reference was made to negotiations with  municipalities  to  ensure
         that they live up to  their  constitutional  obligations  regarding
         the provision and maintenance of facilities.


         In his concluding remarks the MEC made a poignant call for  special
         measures to address imbalances and distortions in sport.


         The chairperson and leader of the delegation thanked the MEC for  a
         detailed report and made the  observation  that  the  MEC  and  his
         department were well organised and  prepared  for  the  visit.  She
         went on to state what the purpose of the visit was, and  said  that
         the Committee was  trying  to  familiarise  itself  with  what  was
         happening  in  the  province,  what  influences  the  provision  of
         facilities, how the facilities are  utilised  by  communities,  how
         accessible the facilities are  for  communities  of  the  different
         racial groups and problems experienced by communities  with  regard
         to sport and recreation.


         The MEC, the standing committee and  officials  of  the  department
         were  all  well  prepared  for  the  visit.  They  gave   all   the
         information  needed  by  the  delegation.  They  had   a   detailed
         programme, which covered all regions in the province. All  relevant
         structures in sport were part of the  programme  presented  to  the
         delegation. The MEC and members  of  the  standing  committee  were
         part of the study  tour  to  some  of  the  areas  visited  by  the
         delegation. Officials in the Department of Sport and  Culture  were
         part of the entire visit and were always pleasant  and  willing  to
         work.


     E.     Observations


         1. Greenpoint School
              This  was  a  newly  built  school,  which  was  going  to  be
              officially opened in  July  2000.  It  was  built  from  funds
              donated by Iscor and the Sport and Education Trust. The school
              has 27 classes. The delegation was joined here by Mr G  Miller
              and Mr S Jonas, who both represented the Community Development
              Forum, which had participated in the building and  setting  up
              of the school.


         2. Old De Beers Ground


              This facility was built in 1995 at a cost of R350 000.  It  is
              used for basketball and volleyball.  Schools  and  federations
              were said to have free use of the facility. The  facility  had
              neatly cut natural grass. It is well looked after by both  the
              community and the municipality.


         3. Greenpoint Primary School


              The delegation met and had  informal  interaction  with  Mr  F
              Swaerbroek, Mr M Arthur, Mr M Gidley and Mr B Kidson, all from
              the Griqualand West Cricket Board.


              The delegation  had  the  opportunity  to  witness  a  cricket
              coaching clinic for the under 13s and 15s. Mr Z Abrahim, their
              coach, was putting the young boys  through  their  paces.  The
              majority of the boys were blacks from previously disadvantaged
              communities, which indicated to the delegation that there  was
              an effort to afford the previously  disadvantaged  communities
              the opportunity to participate in  sporting  codes  previously
              dominated by white people during the apartheid era.


         4. Old Griqualand Rugby Union Field


              The delegation made  a  brief  stop-over  to  see  a  facility
              situated close to West End Township. The community  also  uses
              this facility for community activities. This  facility  is  in
              the care of the Deputy Chairperson of the Sport Council.


         5. Pescodia


              The delegation visited a basic facility, situated just  a  few
              meters from Venus High School. The facility was built  by  the
              provincial department of sport, arts and  culture  from  funds
              provided by the national Department of Sport  and  Recreation.
              This facility was in  a  good  state.  It  had  a  dilapidated
              cricket pitch, for which the municipality was responsible.


         6. Venus High School


              There are three sports facilities in Venus High School,  built
              with money from the Premier's Fund at  a  cost  of  R600  000.
              These facilities are used for soccer, cricket and hockey.  The
              netball court was said to be on the other side of  the  school
              building.


         7. Galashewe


              The  delegation  visited  the  Yorkshire  Cricket  Club.   The
              facility was built as a result  of  co-operation  between  the
              United Cricket Board, the Municipality, the Premier  and  MTN.
              This facility has pitches and nets.


              De Beers was said to be responsible for providing sponsorships
              for club competition.


              At the time of the visit the facility was in use.  Young  boys
              of between 12 and 17 were practicing cricket.  From  what  was
              seen  and  with  continued  sustenance  of   the   development
              programme, there is no doubt that South  Africa  will  produce
              cricket stars of high calibre  from  previously  disadvantaged
              communities.


              The facility was  in  excellent  condition  and  no  cases  of
              vandalism were reported, this being  attributed  to  community
              involvement. Three townships have access to the facility.


              The facility is also going to  be  upgraded,  with  help  from
              Daimler Chrysler and Vodacom.


         8. Olifantshoek


              The delegation visited  a  sports  facility  in  Olifantshoek,
              where an annual soccer tournament organised by the  department
              to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS, was held. The  MEC  for
              Sport was also there to welcome the delegation  and  officiate
              the tournament. An  accompanying  theme  or  message  for  the
              tournament was that of "a child in sport is  a  child  out  of
              jail".  The  leader  of  the  delegation   briefly   addressed
              spectators and athletes.


              An unfortunate part of these tournaments was the fact that the
              ground on which the clubs were playing did not have grass, and
              the reason cited was that water was not just scarce  but  very
              expensive to bring into the area. The leader of the delegation
              undertook to raise the issue with both the Department of Sport
              and Recreation as well as the Department of Water Affairs  and
              Forestry.


         9. Paballelo Stadium


              The delegation visited the  Paballelo  Township  to  view  the
              facility there and to establish which recreational  activities
              were taking place there.  The  facility  catered  for  soccer,
              netball and basketball. The  facility  was  in  an  impeccable
              condition, being looked after by the municipality,  which  had
              provided floodlights. The facility was complete with a  stand,
              well secured with new fencing and had neatly cut natural green
              grass for the pitch.


         10.     Matjieskloof


              The delegation visited Matjieskloof Township a few  kilometers
              away from Springbok to see three  soccer  and  netball  fields
              that had been built in 1996. The delegation was  told  that  a
              lot of excavation work had to  be  done  before  these  sports
              fields could be built, as the area is uneven. The building  of
              each sport field had cost about R350 000. Not one of the three
              had any grass and there were no plans for  this  in  the  near
              future, as water was said to be very expensive in the area.


     F.     Meetings with sports bodies and communities


         The  delegation  held  a  number  of  meetings  in  various  towns,
         townships and villages. These meetings were aimed at:


              Identifying sports development programmes taking place in  the
              province.


              Interacting with the communities in order  to  understand  the
              experiences of different communities with regard to sport.


              Assessing the level of community involvement in sport matters.


              Giving the community an opportunity to give feedback about how
              the programmes of  the  Department  of  Sport  and  Recreation
              impact on them, as well as recommendations relating  to  sport
              and recreation.


         1. Meeting in Ministry's Office


              The delegation met with the officials responsible  for  extra-
              curricular services and the Griqualand  West  Sports  Council.
              This meeting was held  in  the  offices  of  the  Ministry  of
              Education, in 1 Albertyn Road, Newpark. Griqualand USSASA  and
              community development forums also attended this meeting.


              The  leaders  of  the  delegation  provided  a  framework  for
              discussion by explaining to the meeting  the  purpose  of  the
              visit and the focus areas of the meeting. In  the  discussions
              that followed, there were two outstanding issues:


              The Sports Commission - the absence of  communication  between
              the provincial structure of the NSC and the Sports Commission.


              School Sports -  who  is  responsible  for  school  sport  the
              Department  of  Education  or  the  Department  of  Sport  and
              Recreation?


              The leader of the delegation gave information to  the  meeting
              regarding sports related legislation that was in the pipeline.
              This legislation were explained within the context of problems
              that were raised by the meeting, and included the issue  of  a
              lack of sponsorship for clubs which are not at  the  level  of
              the Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs and Ajax Cape  Town.  Among
              the issues raised, was the  issue  of  funding  based  on  the
              population of the province. People from the Northern Cape felt
              that funding  should  not  be  based  on  population,  but  on
              conditions prevailing in each province. In  the  case  of  the
              Northern Cape, the issue of poverty,  scarcity  of  water  and
              high rate of unemployment were viewed by the  meeting  as  the
              most appropriate yardstick and base for funding instead of the
              population figures.
              A clarion call was made by the leader of  the  delegation  for
              all the structures to go back and look into the whole question
              of their interaction and contribution to  the  development  of
              sport in their province.


         2. Meeting at Department of Sport in Upington


              The delegation had a session  with  representatives  from  the
              following structures: North West region of USSASA, NSC, rugby,
              adult  netball   and   the   Recreation   officer   from   the
              municipality. A broad framework for discussion was  tabled  by
              the leader of the  delegation,  who  said  they  were  in  the
              province to see, amongst other things the  facilities  in  the
              province, the conditions of those  facilities,  the  level  of
              usage of these facilities, the accessibility of the facilities
              to all members  of  the  community  regardless  of  race,  the
              accessibility of sport to  all,  what  development  programmes
              there were, and whether teams in the  province  reflected  the
              demographics of the country or province.


              The USSASA representatives talked about the mass participation
              programme  and  the  healthy  relations  they  had  with   the
              Department of Education, alluding to the assistance  given  to
              by the principals. USSASA also pointed out  that  pupils  were
              still  not  able  to  compete  in  some  competitions  due  to
              financial constrains.
              The municipality  was  accused  of  not  consulting  with  the
              community, particularly  on  the  issue  of  reallocating  the
              funding to another community  without  consultation  with  the
              community which was initially awarded  the  same  funding  for
              building a sports facility.


              It was also pointed out  that  there  are  very  few  teachers
              involved in sport, and as a result the  talent  identification
              programme misses some of the children with sporting talents.


              The most acute problem  highlighted  and  experienced  by  the
              adult netball was the absence of sponsorships. The development
              of rugby at club level  was  continuing  although  there  were
              distortions, as facilities  were  not  readily  accessible  to
              pupils from previously disadvantaged  communities  because  of
              transport problems.
              Local council representatives alluded to the co-operation they
              continue to receive from the Sports Council. However,  in  the
              same vein mention was made about the absence of  a  Facilities
              Committee in the council itself, making it difficult  for  the
              relevant officer to operationalise his vision relating to  the
              provision of facilities.


              After  identifying  a  lack   of   communication   and   sound
              interaction between the structures in the area, the delegation
              called on the representatives to put their house in order.


              Ms A Botha, a member of the provincial legislature,  undertook
              to raise all  issues  highlighted  in  the  meeting  with  the
              provincial standing committee on sport and also with the MEC.


         3. Meeting in District Council Building
              The meeting took place at the district council building, where
              the delegation met with the following structures and  sporting
              codes: SAFA  District,  netball,  rugby,  USSASA,  tennis  and
              cricket. Each of these structures was given an opportunity  to
              share with delegates what each of  them  was  doing  in  their
              respective  fields.  The   problems   highlighted   by   these
              structures centered on the issue of:


              (a) Lack of funding from national federations.


              (b) Absence of sponsorships  and,  as  a  result  sport  being
                  funded from pockets of individuals involved in sport.


              (c) Long distances between towns, which had the  potential  of
                  killing sport in that region.


              (d) Inadequate facilities, for example, with cricket there was
                  only one field and no transport.


              It was made clear by the leader of  the  delegation  that  the
              main focus is competent athletes,  therefore  the  development
              programme becomes the central nerve of all sports  activities.
              She pointed out that sports facilities should not be viewed as
              the end product of the delivery  process,  as  they  are  only
              means through which athletes will be developed.


              A plea was made for co-operation between federations  and  the
              three spheres of government particularly the local  sphere  of
              government.


              The leader of  the  delegation  pointed  out  that  facilities
              provided by government structures should be  informed  by  the
              programmes and needs of the sports bodies  in  the  area.  She
              emphasised that the business of sports  bodies  together  with
              the government  of  this  country  was  to  produce  competent
              players who would make South Africa excel in sports within the
              global village.


         4. Meeting in Calvinia indoor sports hall


              The meeting took place in an indoor sport facility at Calvinia
              stadium, the only facility that is publicly owned, as most  of
              the facilities are privately owned. The meeting was graced  by
              the presence of the speaker of the  Northern  Cape  provincial
              legislature Mr C A T Smith and the Mayor of Calvinia, Mr  C  V
              Peterson. The following discipliness were also present, namely
              rugby, soccer, volleyball as well as the USSASA body.


              The meeting was held at night and the  delegation  experienced
              the freezing temperature the area is well known for.


              The leader of the delegation apologised to representatives  of
              the different structures for arriving late at night. She  also
              thanked the representatives for the patience shown by  waiting
              in the freezing temperature for the delegation to arrive.  She
              then explained the purpose of the visit, and said there was  a
              national vision for sports where the government of the country
              wanted to transform sports and make it possible for people  of
              South Africa to participate in sport activities of  their  own
              choice. She also mentioned that the ultimate goal is for South
              Africa to compete at international level as an equal  partner.
              Four focus areas to make that possible, include:


              (a) Providing communities with adequate sports facilities  and
                  maintaining those facilities.


              (b)  Breeding  competent  sports   managers,   administrators,
                  coaches and athletes through  development  programmes  and
                  establishment of sports academies and  sports  development
                  centres.


              (c) Making  sport  facilities  accessible  to  all,  including
                  disabled and rural communities.


              (d) Ensuring that sports teams particularly the national team,
                  represent the demographics of the country.


              It was pointed out that what the delegation  wanted  to  hear,
              was being done in the Northern Cape in relation  to  the  four
              areas of focus mentioned above.


              All sports codes represented in the  meeting  highlighted  the
              following problems:


              *   The high poverty levels, which impacts negatively on sport
                  in general.


              *   The fact that farming was the main source of income in the
                  area.


              *   Lack of financial resources needed to  send  children  who
                  are doing well in sport and are  selected  to  compete  at
                  national level.


              *   Long distances between towns were also highlighted as  one
                  of the hindering  factors  to  participation  of  children
                  from Calvinia in competitions.
              *   The issue of affiliation of the local teams to  provincial
                  structures. It was mentioned that some sports  federations
                  in Calvinia were not sure whether  they  should  affiliate
                  to the Western Cape  structures,  as  they  play  most  of
                  their games with the Western  Cape  teams  (Boland).  This
                  was due to the fact that they were closer to  the  Western
                  Cape than to other towns in the Northern Cape.


              *   The fact that it was very expensive  for  local  teams  to
                  affiliate to the sports federation.


              *   The fact that the facility in which the meeting was  held,
                  was not accessible to disabled people.


              *   The over-utilisation of the only public sports facility in
                  the area.


              *   A call was made by the  local  people  to  the  provincial
                  Department  of  Education  and  Sport  to  make  financial
                  resources  available  for  the   development   of   sports
                  facilities in the area thereby  enabling  school  children
                  to participate in sport at school level.


     G.     Observations


         The delegation identified that Calvinia was trailing behind  in  so
         far as sports facilities were concerned.  It  was  identified  that
         because of the distance between Calvinia and Kimberley,  where  the
         department is located, Calvinia was not getting  equal  support  to
         that of other towns from the Department of Education and Sport.


         It would therefore be recommended that the Department of  Education
         and Sport pay attention to the issues raised by this community  and
         also find ways of keeping contact with sports bodies in Calvinia.


     H.     Overall comments


         The late MEC for sport, Mr Brian Hermanus, was seen to  be  on  top
         of the sports issues, with a clear programme of keeping  the  youth
         out of jails. The Premier of the province was also seen to be  very
         supportive of sports development. The officials of  the  department
         were highly committed and prepared to work extra  hours  to  ensure
         that programmes of sport were efficiently and effectively  managed.
         The MEC was seen to be at the level  of  the  people  in  terms  of
         interaction and communication with structures  on  the  ground.  It
         was unfortunate that he passed  away  before  the  presentation  of
         this report. This was the first province in which  members  of  the
         standing committee on sport were part of  the  meetings  that  were
         held with the delegation of the Portfolio Committee  on  Sport  and
         Recreation. It was also clear in the  meetings  that  the  Standing
         Committee  members  had  a  full  understanding  of  sports-related
         matters in the province.


         The successor of the late MEC would find it easy to follow  such  a
         clear programme in sport.


     I.     Recommendations


         The Committee -


         1. noting that some sports facilities have no grass and that  water
              in the Northern Cape is  not  just  scarce  but  expensive  to
              reticulate  (recommended  that   special   funding   for   the
              installation of synthetic grass at those facilities which have
              no grass be made available by the national Department of Sport
              and Recreation to the  Northern  Cape,  thereby  bringing  the
              level of standard of facilities in the Northern  Cape  to  the
              level of facilities that are found in other provinces);


         2. noting  that  some  of  the  facilities  are  neglected  by  the
              municipalities responsible for maintaining such facilities;


         3. noting that some municipalities lack the capacity  of  providing
              and maintaining the sports facilities;


         4. noting that members of the community, which such facilities  are
              provided to improve their living  standards,  vandalise  these
              facilities, and


         recommends that -


         (a)     the provincial department of sport  engages  municipalities
              for purposes of identifying  problems affecting municipalities
              in this regard;
         (b)     the provincial department of sport builds the  capacity  of
              municipalities around sports issues;


         (c)     sports forums be  established  at  local  level  so  as  to
              facilitate  community   ownership   to   facilities,   thereby
              preventing vandalism from taking place.


         It is recommended that exchange programmes  between  the  provinces
         be initiated so as learn from one another,  the  Northern  Province
         being one province from whom a lot could be learnt.
