                          CALLING OF JOINT SITTING

The Speaker announced that the President had requested that a Joint  Sitting
of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces  be  convened
in terms of Joint Rule 7(1), on  Friday,  8  February  2002,  at  11:00,  to
enable him to deliver his annual address to Parliament.

                    ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC

The  PRESIDENT  OF  THE  REPUBLIC:  Madam  Speaker   and   Deputy   Speaker,
Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, hon members of our  national
Parliament, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Chief Justice  of  South  Africa
as well as other members of our judiciary, heads of the  security  services,
Governor of the Reserve Bank,  honourable  Premiers  and  MECs,  traditional
leaders, representatives of local government, former President  Mandela  and
Mrs  Machel,  Your  Excellencies,  Ambassadors   and   High   Commissioners,
distinguished guests, fellow  South  Africans,  decision-makers  across  the
globe have accepted the  reality  that  the  global  struggle  to  eradicate
poverty and underdevelopment  is  fundamental  to  the  wellbeing  of  human
society.

We know as a matter of fact that  the  struggle  to  eradicate  poverty  and
underdevelopment in our own country is fundamental  to  the  achievement  of
our own national goal of building a caring and  people-centred  society.  Of
decisive importance to the millions of our people  and  the  future  of  our
country as we meet here today, the central question we will have  to  answer
at the end of the day is whether what we are doing as the  legislature,  the
executive and the  judiciary,  as  well  as  the  fourth  estate  and  civil
society,  is  helping  to  lift  from  the  shoulders  of  our  people   the
intolerable burden of poverty  and  underdevelopment.  This  fourth  opening
session of our second democratic Parliament, including the debate that  will
take place next week, must answer this  question  in  a  frank,  honest  and
forthright manner.

What I know and can say without any equivocation is  that  during  the  past
year our country has, in real terms and  within  its  means,  moved  further
forward towards a society free of poverty and underdevelopment. This I  will
also say: we are nowhere near liberating millions of our people  from  these
scourges. But I  will  also  say  that  gradually,  step  by  step,  we  are
progressing towards the achievement of the historic goal of the  eradication
of a centuries-old legacy of colonialism, racism and apartheid. This I  will
also say: the overwhelming majority of our  people  consider  themselves  as
actors in the unfolding and  measured  drama  of  the  eradication  of  this
legacy.

Our Deputy President, the hon Jacob Zuma, is not with us  today  because  he
had to attend a summit on Nepad in France, at the  invitation  of  President
Jacques Chirac. At the end of the summit he will proceed directly to  Dakar,
Senegal, for another summit with Prime Minister Tony Blair.  Accordingly,  I
am honoured to convey an apology for his unavoidable absence today.

We wish to acknowledge the presence of the widow of the late  Moses  Kotane,
a great leader of our people; Rebecca Kotane is with us  today.  [Applause.]
Happy birthday to her - she is celebrating  her  90th  birthday  this  year.
[Applause.] I am also happy to welcome Mrs Nontsikelelo Biko, the  widow  of
the late Steve Biko. [Applause.] This year marks  the  25th  anniversary  of
his assassination.

Scientists say that anatomically, modern humans - people who look like us  -
evolved in Africa about 150 000 years ago and  then  slowly  spread  out  to
occupy most of the globe. A key question  has  been  when  and  where  these
people first become modern in their  behaviour.  Until  now,  archaeological
evidence has pointed to Europe as the centre for this development  about  35
000 years ago. The markers for modern behaviour include  the  production  of
art, bone tools and a capacity for symbolism.  Lack  of  evidence  of  these
behaviours suggested that people in Africa lagged behind those in Europe.
Remarkable new finds by South African archaeologists at Blombos Cave in  the
Southern Cape indicate that the prehistory of  Africa  and  its  people  now
needs rewriting. Blombos Cave has  produced  evidence  that  African  people
were producing exquisite bone tools and delicately made stone  spear  points
more than 70 000 years ago.

But the most spectacular find is a slab  of  ochre  engraved  with  abstract
designs 77 000 years ago. Described by the South  African  Museum  as  ``the
world's oldest art object'', this invaluable slab of ochre is on display  in
this case next to the podium, an example of the  extraordinary  heritage  of
the evolution of humanity that resides within  our  country,  and  which  we
must preserve.

The designs on the slab were made deliberately  and  with  symbolic  intent.
The scientists say that it is now to Africa that we look for the origins  of
the human imagination, human ingenuity and the genesis of  art.  [Applause.]
We thank the South African Museum for lending us  this  exhibit  for  a  few
hours, as well as the presiding officers for  agreeing  that  it  should  be
brought into the chamber.

I  am  especially  pleased  to  welcome  to  our   Parliament   Prof   Chris
Henshilwood, who led a team of scientists that found the Blombos  engraving.
[Applause.] All of us are committed to doing everything we  can  to  support
our scientists, who are working selflessly to unravel the mysteries  of  the
evolution of humanity. We also look forward to Parliament's  own  Millennium
Project, which aims to collect, collate and interpret our  diverse  heritage
so that we may build a common identity and nationhood.

We meet here at the beginning of a year during which our country  will  host
two summit meetings of great significance to Africa  and  the  world.  These
are the founding summit meeting of the African Union in July and  the  World
Summit for Sustainable Development in August-September.

In addition to launching the AU, the first  of  these  summits  will,  among
other things, take important decisions about the critical  issues  of  peace
and stability, good political governance and good  economic  governance.  It
will also present the opportunity to  consider  specific  and  implementable
Nepad development programmes, whose central objective is the elimination  of
poverty and underdevelopment on our continent.
The Johannesburg World Summit for Sustainable Development, the largest high-
level international gathering this year, will also  focus  on  the  critical
matter  of  development  and  the  eradication  of  poverty.  This   is   of
fundamental interest to our country, our  continent  and  the  rest  of  the
developing world. It will build on  what  was  agreed  at  the  historic  UN
Millennium Summit of the year 2000 and the Monterey, Mexico conference  next
month, which will discuss financing for development.

The nations of the world elected  to  come  to  our  country,  because  they
understand and appreciate what we have done in the last  seven  and  a  half
years to address within our own borders precisely the  same  questions  that
constitute the global  agenda.  They  chose  to  convene  in  South  Africa,
because they are convinced that we have something of value to contribute  to
the building of a new and  more  equitable  world  order  that  must  surely
emerge. The recognition by the peoples of the world  of  the  fact  that  we
have established ourselves as a winning nation, as a  people  determined  to
succeed, places an obligation on us in fact to succeed.

Today, millions of our people ask themselves the question: How can I lend  a
hand in the national effort to build a  better  life  for  all?  During  our
recent visit to New York to participate in  the  proceedings  of  the  World
Economic Forum, we had the privilege to meet South Africans who live  in  or
have become citizens of the United States.  They  are  Marco  Piovesan,  who
lives  in  Atlanta,  Georgia  and  Cathy  Gorille,  who  lives  in  Seattle,
Washington.

They and their friends, all born in South  Africa,  have  also  been  asking
themselves the question: How can we, who reside in the United  States,  lend
a hand in the  national  effort  to  build  a  better  life  for  all  South
Africans? From across the Atlantic, they have  decided  to  make  their  own
contribution to the common national effort by concentrating their  resources
and expertise in a programme for the reconstruction and development  of  our
country. Correctly and  interestingly,  they  have  titled  their  programme
``Vukuzenzele'', which idiomatically  might  be  expressed  as  ``Arise  and
act.'' [Applause.] The call they have made applies to each one of us, as  we
review a year in which we called for unity in action for change among  South
Africans. It is an  abiding  challenge  as  we  set  out  the  programme  of
Government for the coming period.

On the occasion of our address to the Joint Sitting of  our  two  Houses  of
Parliament last year, we set out a programme of action focused on taking  us
further forward on the road towards a better life for all  our  people.  The
programme,  as  further  elaborated  by  Ministers  in  their  addresses  to
Parliament and their public briefings,  was  concrete.  Where  possible,  we
indicated  the  timeframes  within  which  particular   actions   would   be
undertaken.

And so the time has come  to  account.  A  few  weeks  ago  we  received  an
unsolicited  report  from  a  team  of  academics  at  the   University   of
Stellenbosch,  led  by  Prof  Willie  Esterhuyse,  which  comments  on   our
Government's performance during the course of the year 2001. Having  studied
the programme Government set itself at the beginning of the year,  the  team
undertook a systematic analysis of what had  been  done  to  implement  this
programme. This is what the team has to say:


  The President made 43 promises in his  speech.  By  8  January  2002,  11
  months after the speech was made, 65% of these have either been  achieved
  or are credibly in progress; 16% have not been  achieved.  That  gives  a
  ratio of four items of progress versus one item not yet completed.


  On a further 19% we do not have sufficient information to  make  a  call.
  Sixty-five  per  cent  versus  16%  is,  in  our  opinion  a  very   good
  performance.

[Applause.]


  Governance  is  not  about   pushing   buttons   and   things   happening
  instantaneously.  Various  obstacles  like  inertia,  vested   interests,
  competing agendas, lack of capacity and the like must be overcome.


  From various speeches and press releases it is clear that  Ministers  are
  working towards the goals set by the President. Looked at closely,  there
  is coherence and a sense of purpose and integration.


  Some of the 16% of items not yet achieved are those  with  a  very  large
  impact on the economy and  society,  like  the  Telkom  IPO,  clarity  on
  telecommunication issues and an effective campaign against Aids. We  have
  taken a hard line and  suggested  that  these  have  not  been  achieved,
  although Government can certainly argue that they are in progress.

The team then explains why, in its opinion, things  do  not  look  and  feel
better, as they put it, despite the progress that has been achieved. In  its
view, firstly this is because communication  by  Government  is  not  always
optimum. Secondly, it is because despite a lot of  good  progress  on  macro
issues that are vitally important, these are far removed from the person  in
the street. They go on:


  We should also submit that, looking back at 2001, the very solid progress
  recorded has been overshadowed by developments  in  Zimbabwe  and  around
  HIV/Aids.

As Government, and even as members of Parliament,  we  may  not  agree  with
some or other part of these comments, but there is no  gainsaying  the  fact
that the analysis provides a fair assessment of  Government's  work  in  the
past  year.  As  the  team  says,  the  national  successes  are  cause  for
celebration. Overall, we should all be proud that steadily, our  country  is
moving away  from  the  past  of  racism,  poverty,  conflict  and  economic
stagnation.

The weaknesses  pointed  out  by  the  Stellenbosch  researchers  reflect  a
variety of limitations in the structures  and  systems  of  Government  that
should be put right. We can proffer a host of cogent reasons for  these  and
other shortcomings, but to the extent  that  we  have  the  capacity  to  do
something about the problems,  we  should  and  do  take  responsibility  as
Government.

I would like to take this opportunity  to  express  our  gratitude  to  Prof
Esterhuyse and his team for an informative, honest, frank and  dispassionate
assessment of the  work  of  Government.  [Applause.]  Besides  putting  the
resources of  the  university  at  the  disposal  of  the  nation's  current
endeavours,  there  is  an  important  moral  to  this  initiative  of   the
Stellenbosch academics. Without being asked by anybody in Government,  in  a
very practical manner the Stellenbosch team answered the question:  How  can
I lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all?

The past year has brought to the fore  many  patriotic  South  Africans  who
have found a practical answer to this question.  These  include  the  school
principal at Sandi Secondary School near Umtata, Bongi Peyana,  who  put  in
an extra effort to raise a derelict institution towards the highest  summits
of success in teaching and learning.

They include Ivan Booth, a young South African who, after  numerous  debates
with his peers about the opportunities that democratic South  Africa  offers
to all  its  people,  decided  to  draft  a  manuscript  for  a  publication
entitled, South Africa: Reasons to Stay.  Ivan says the book is dedicated -


  ... to the nation that won its place in history
  the nation with the brightest future
  the nation that fights and wins
  the nation that doesn't know how great it is.

In a postscript to his foreword, this young and proud South African writes:


  Several people have mentioned that  anyone  publishing  such  a  book  is
  effectively pushing themselves into a corner, should they  ever  wish  to
  leave South Africa. Hell, yes, what a corner!

[Applause.] I trust that the presiding officers will excuse the language!

These heroes who are lending a hand to make  South  Africa  succeed  include
the children of  the  Inkonjane  Senior  Phase  School  in  Soweto  who,  in
partnership with  the  Sunday  Times,  volunteered  their  time  and  meagre
resources  to  help  fellow  children  in  rural  Ingwavuma,   KwaZulu-Natal
affected by Aids and ill health.  They  include  the  people  of  Rockville,
Soweto, who during the course of last year strengthened  their  co-operation
with the Police Service and have, as a result, reduced crime in  their  area
by half in 2001.

These and many other South Africans are the true heroes and heroines of  our
nation - the volunteers whose selfless dedication will ensure that  we  make
progress to make ours truly a nation of hope. We have  it  within  us  as  a
nation to join  them  and  many  others  to  forge  a  massive  movement  of
volunteers - dedicated workers in all fields of life - to bring to life  our
people's  enduring  attributes  of  perseverance  and  persistence  in   the
struggle for our own good and the good of humanity.

The assessment of the Stellenbosch team that we referred to earlier is  that
we are making progress as a nation in addressing the  social  backlogs  that
we inherited  from  the  past.  Let  us  examine,  from  data  available  in
Government, what the trends are in this regard.

In the five calendar years leading to the  end  of  1998,  3  million  South
Africans had been provided with access to clean running  water  through  the
community water supply project. In only three years since  1999,  4  million
more have been connected, bringing the total to 7  million.  [Applause.]  In
the five calendar years to the end of 1998,  2,3  million  electricity  grid
connections had been made. In the three years since 1999,  1,2  million  new
connections had been made, bringing the total to 3,48 million. [Applause.]

About 444 000 hectares had been redistributed in the land  reform  programme
in the five years to the end of 1998. In the  three  years  since  then  the
number has increased to 600 000 hectares,  bringing  the  total  to  over  1
million hectares. [Applause.]

The pace has dramatically increased in the case of  land  restitution,  with
48 claims settled at the end of 1998 while by the  end  of  2001  the  total
number of settlements had increased to 29 000. [Applause.] While the  number
of houses built or under construction was 514 000 at the end  of  1998,  the
number currently stands at 1,2 million. [Applause.]

These figures testify to the the progress we are making in  providing  basic
services to the majority of South Africans.  They  add  to  the  qualitative
improvements in learning and  teaching  in  our  schools  and  the  dramatic
improvements in matric results, which show that the  transformation  process
is starting to bear fruit.

The masses of our people, both black and white, both resident  at  home  and
abroad are, like the peoples of the world, driven by hope and confidence  in
our future as a country. They are determined to see  our  country  progress,
refusing to demoralise themselves  by  succumbing  to  carefully  cultivated
pessimism and despair. As a Government elected by the overwhelming  majority
of our people, we have an obligation to respond to  and  sustain  this  hope
and confidence in a rational, realistic and practical manner.

As it must do, the Government has conducted its own thorough  assessment  of
its performance and the state of the nation. We have also studied  carefully
the findings and comments  made  by  the  academics  at  the  University  of
Stellenbosch. We have recalled our obligations  and  have  also  taken  into
account what the Stellenbosch academics said,  ie  that  governance  is  not
about pushing buttons and then things happen instantaneously.

The programme we will pursue this year builds on the foundations  that  have
already been laid. It is  informed  by  the  broad  objectives  our  country
agreed upon in the context of the goal of  reconstruction  and  development,
at the centre of which is the eradication  of  the  legacy  of  poverty  and
underdevelopment.

This year the Government will work to reduce the level  of  poverty  in  our
society. This will be expressed in concrete, time-specific programmes.  This
year the Government will work further to develop our greatest resource,  our
people,  including  the  working  people,  the  women,  the  youth  and  the
disabled. Particular attention will be  paid  to  such  matters  as  health,
including Aids, education and training and the National Youth Service.
This year the Government will initiate additional programmes to improve  the
quality of life of all our people, encompassing such issues  as  safety  and
security and moral renewal. This year the Government will further  intensify
its attention on questions of social equity. This will  include  matters  of
black  economic  empowerment,  women's  emancipation  and  justice  for  the
disabled.

This year the Government will further increase its focus  on  the  issue  of
achieving higher  rates  of  economic  growth  and  development.  This  will
include the promotion of domestic and foreign investment,  trade  promotion,
a social accord and the convening of a growth summit.

This year, building on the agreement we have reached with the public  sector
unions,  Government  will  work  further  to  improve  the   efficiency   of
Government. We will pay particular attention to such questions as  radically
improving professional competence at all levels  of  Government,  to  change
the quality of service delivery.

This year the Government will take additional steps  further  to  strengthen
and entrench our system of democratic  governance.  This  will  include  the
appropriate celebration of the 5th anniversary of our Constitution  and  the
resolution of the various  questions  relating  to  cultural,  language  and
religious rights, as well as  the  issue  of  the  place  and  role  of  our
traditional system of government.

This year the Government will work to discharge  its  current  international
responsibilities. This will include the hosting of  the  summit  conferences
we have referred to and other  tasks  that  relate  to  specific  instances,
including the situation in the Middle East, as well  as  the  fight  against
terrorism.

Finally, this year the Government will work further to strengthen its  links
with the  masses  of  our  people.  Accordingly,  we  will  participate  in,
encourage and promote the involvement of as many of our people  as  possible
in the people's campaign, Vukuzenzele. In this context, we  will  strive  to
give real meaning to the strategic  challenge  facing  the  Public  Service,
Batho Pele.

As regards pushing back the frontiers of poverty,  this  shall  be  done  in
partnership with many in our society who are ready to lend  a  hand  in  the
national effort to build a better life. Let us cite some  of  the  tasks  in
this regard.
We  need  massive  mobilisation  around  registration  for  social   grants.
Government paid out 3,3 million grants in  November  2000,  and  the  number
increased to 3,8 million by November 2001, the greatest  increase  being  in
child grants. In its programme for the medium term, Government had  targeted
the registration of 3 million children eligible for a grant by  2005.  As  a
result of better awareness and improved efforts by the  Public  Service,  we
are on course to meet this target by 2003.

Government will in the next  few  weeks  approach  religious  bodies,  trade
unions, traditional leaders, youth structures, civic  associations,  women's
organisations and others for all of us to lend a hand so that  in  the  next
three years, we should register all who are eligible  for  the  child  grant
and other social allowances.

With each one of us lending a hand we can attain this,  and  further  ensure
that we not only improve the integrity of  the  system  against  corruption,
but also that new registrations are conducted in reasonable  time.  I  would
like to add - as the Minister  of  Finance  will  elaborate  in  the  Budget
Speech - that we shall  this  year  increase  allocations  to  both  old-age
pensions  and  child  grants  by  far  more  than  the  rate  of  inflation.
[Applause.]

This call for a national partnership in support of beneficiaries  of  social
grants, and the increases that we have referred to underline the  commitment
of this Government to  improving  the  conditions  of  the  most  vulnerable
sectors of our population. The plight of the poor  is  at  the  top  of  our
agenda. Again, as part of our work to push back  the  frontiers  of  poverty
and expand access to a better life,  possibilities  have  been  created  for
further tax cuts, particularly for the lower end  of  the  salary  scale,  a
critical contribution by  Government  to  higher  real  wages  for  workers.
[Applause.]

Preserving and developing our human resources is a matter  that  all  of  us
should pay particular attention  to,  both  individually  and  collectively.
Government  has  implemented  the  Human  Resource  Development   Programme,
conscious of the fact  that  it  is  the  surest  guarantee  of  sustainable
employment  and  economic  growth.  Tens  of  thousands  of  trainees   have
benefited  from  this,  ranging  from  science  and  mathematics   teachers,
agricultural  inspectors  and  information  and  communications   technology
learnerships, to retrenched  mineworkers  and  so  on.  This  work  will  be
intensified during the course of this year.

Studies that  we  have  conducted  and  interaction  with  the  Presidential
Information and Communications Technology Councils - whose establishment  we
announced last year - have shown that a critical and  pervasive  element  in
economic development in the  current  age  is  the  optimum  utilisation  of
information  and  communications  technology.  In  addition  to   the   many
programmes we have introduced in this area, including telecentres, we  shall
as a matter of urgency complete the work towards  the  establishment  of  an
information and communications technology university. [Applause.]  I  should
mention in this regard that Microsoft informed me last week that  they  have
decided to donate to the 32 000 South African public schools on a  permanent
basis, all the software that they need. [Applause.]

The implementation of the National  Plan  for  Higher  Education  will  gain
momentum in the coming months, and Government is under no illusion that  the
process will be easy. We are confident, though, that working in  partnership
with higher education institutions, we shall  fashion  a  system  that  will
ensure that we meet the challenges of the modern world.

Again, in the spirit of Vukuzenzele, we must arise and  act  in  partnership
across the nation and ensure proper teaching and learning  in  our  schools.
Government will in the current medium-term expenditure period  allocate  the
necessary  resources  to  ensure  that  no  child  studies  under  a   tree.
[Applause.] Consultations will be held with  provincial  administrations  to
ensure that this programme is put in place as a matter of urgency.

Further, through Community-based  Public  Works  Programmes,  it  should  be
possible to allocate resources  for  massive  restoration  projects  in  our
schools, clinics, hospitals and other  amenities  across  the  country.  The
Gauteng province informs us that R500 million over three years  has  already
been allocated for this purpose.

As we push back the frontiers of poverty, the Integrated  sustainable  Rural
Development and Urban Renewal Programmes assume  critical  importance.  Work
has started in all the 13 rural nodes identified last year, with  integrated
programmes  ranging  from   community   production   centres,   multipurpose
community centres, social infrastructure  projects  and  others  being  laid
out. In the urban nodes, business plans have been finalised and a number  of
projects are already being implemented.

Emphasis will be placed particularly in the rural areas,  on  ensuring  food
security and community-based  job  creation  projects,  so  as  directly  to
address the state of poverty in which these communities live.  Consolidating
this integrated work in the nodes already identified will be  the  focus  of
Government's work this year. This will then lay the basis for the  extension
of the nodes to other parts of the country in the near future.

We intend, within the next three years, to  complete  the  land  restitution
process, which is a critical part of our  land  reform  programme.  In  each
province of the country,  intensive  water  and  sanitation  programmes  are
being implemented to improve hygiene, with emphasis on schools and  cholera-
affected localities in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.  Though  we  have
contained the worst impact of this disease in these areas, we  operate  from
the premise that the long-term solution is quality services to all.

Government, working in partnership with all  sectors,  particularly  the  SA
National Aids Council, Sanac, will  intensify  its  comprehensive  programme
against  Aids,  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  tuberculosis   and   other
communicable diseases. In implementing the agreement  we  reached  with  the
pharmaceutical companies, we have initiated discussions with  some  of  them
to examine new ways of making drugs more affordable and  to  strengthen  our
health infrastructure. I must say that they are responding  very  positively
indeed. [Applause.]

The work that is being done by various institutions  within  or  related  to
Government on the health profile of  the  nation  -  ie  on  the  burden  of
disease, regional and local trends, mortality statistics  and  so  on  -  is
critical in fashioning a comprehensive  response  in  both  the  public  and
private sectors. In addition to the many campaigns to change our  lifestyles
for healthier living, the focus of our programmes in the coming period  will
be improvement in the quality of services in the public health system.

With regard to Aids in particular, our focus remains  a  massive  prevention
campaign directed at ensuring that the high  rates  of  awareness  translate
into a change in lifestyles; care for the affected and  infected;  treatment
of all diseases, including those associated with Aids; and research  into  a
vaccine. This programme has been described by the head of UNAIDS,  Dr  Peter
Piot, as the largest and  most  comprehensive  in  Africa  and  one  of  the
largest in the world. [Applause.] He says that the programme has one of  the
highest levels of government investment and is already showing results.

Proceeding from the accepted premise that there is no cure for Aids, we  are
convinced that, besides our  individual  and  collective  responsibility  to
take care of our own lives, protection and enhancement of the immune  system
is a critical intervention in both the prevention and  management  of  Aids.
By implication,  therefore,  poverty  reduction  and  appropriate  nutrition
constitute an important front in this campaign.

At the same time, continuing work will be done to monitor  the  efficacy  of
antiretroviral interventions against  mother-to-child  transmission  in  the
sites already operational and any new ones that may  be  decided  upon.  Our
partnership across society should advance these multiple interventions  that
are required for us to deal with this epidemic. Any focus on one  issue,  at
the expense of the others, may have the effect of undermining  what  we  all
seek to achieve.

Last December, the SA Police Service released  comprehensive  statistics  on
the incidence of crime in our society and the  trends  that  attach  to  the
rates of various forms of crime. It is our hope that  hon  members  and  the
whole of our country, including the media,  will  continue  to  apply  their
minds to the issues raised in that briefing, better to appreciate  the  role
that society as a whole needs to play in dealing with this scourge.

Indeed, when impassioned calls were made for the release of  statistics,  we
believe the aim was not to check whether Government was delivering,  as  was
said, but to ensure that all of us lent a hand in the efforts to combat  and
prevent crime. The simple fact that  most  of  the  crimes  of  assault  and
murder happen between Friday and Sunday among people who know  one  another,
many of them under  the  influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs,  speaks  to  the
critical  importance  of  community  organisation  and  systems  of   social
censure.

Clearly, many of these crimes, as well as those related  to  rape,  domestic
violence and child abuse, cannot be policed with any measure of  success  by
the security agencies acting alone. Credit is due to the thousands of  South
Africans who have joined community police fora and  our  Police  Service  as
reservists. Together, if each one of  us  lends  a  hand,  we  can  do  much
better. During the month of February, communities  and  their  organisations
have mobilised to enlist more volunteers.  Sustained  throughout  the  year,
and with each one making a contribution, we can surpass the  30  000  target
set by the Police Service.

The police and the Department of Justice  will  continue  their  interaction
with communities and organisations, to ensure that particular  attention  is
paid to assisting in such areas as clerical work in police stations and  the
courts, so that we are  able  massively  to  reduce  the  backlog  of  cases
awaiting trial. Legal and other professionals, students and  other  sections
in our communities can play an important role in this regard.

Having set itself the target of stabilising 145 police station  areas  where
over 50% of crimes are committed within five years,  our  security  agencies
have managed to attain this in one year. [Applause.] More attention  in  the
coming period will also be paid to improving the  intelligence  capacity  of
our security agencies, particularly to build  on  the  successes  that  have
been made in dealing with organised crime.

As we said earlier, these  trends  in  crime  incidents  as  well  as  other
problems within society, including white-collar crime, call for  partnership
across society to improve our moral fibre, to  strengthen  community  bonds,
and to pull together in the direction of  hope  and  success.  Consultations
have  started  with  various  organised  formations  to  convene   a   moral
regeneration summit as a matter of urgency. Such  a  summit  should  address
the issue of the responsibility that each and all of us should take for  our
lives, moving from the understanding  that,  as  all  of  us  were  our  own
liberators in resistance against apartheid, so too should we  today  act  as
our own liberators in dealing with its legacy.

Moral regeneration also means inculcating in ourselves and  our  youth  that
service to the people, selfless commitment  to  the  common  good,  is  more
valuable than selfish pursuit of material rewards. Productive investment  is
more valuable than aimless gambling in markets for derivatives. Payment  for
honest work is more fulfilling and  sustainable  than  theft.  Children  and
women are there to be respected, not to become targets of abuse.

As part of the people's campaign, Vukuzenzele, we must  intensify  our  work
on the question of social equity. We  do  this  as  a  continuation  of  our
struggle and in order to fulfil the commitments we made  with  the  rest  of
humanity at the World Conference against Racism that we had  the  honour  to
host last year. In this regard,  we  must  ensure  that  we  accelerate  and
entrench the forward march of women's emancipation in  all  spheres  of  our
lives. As in the past, Government  must  take  the  lead  in  promoting  and
protecting the rights of women. [Applause.] We also need to  reflect,  as  a
nation, whether we are  making  the  necessary  progress  in  advancing  the
constitutional rights of the disabled.

Further, part  of  our  programme  to  bring  about  social  equity  is  the
successful implementation of the programme for black  economic  empowerment.
Clearly, we need rigorous and visible  progress  in  this  area,  so  as  to
ensure that not only is the distribution of wealth  and  economic  power  in
line with the demographics of our country, but also  that  our  economy  and
society as a whole can benefit from the wisdom and potential  of  all  South
Africans, and that the  benefits  of  such  empowerment  are  shared  across
society and not just by a few.

Government has accepted the  most  critical  recommendations  of  the  Black
Economic Empowerment commission. On the two specific  areas  of  legislation
and institutional frameworks, it has been decided as follows: Firstly,  that
all sectoral legislation will be examined to ensure that the  obligation  of
black economic empowerment is incorporated in it, on  the  basis  of  common
principles agreed upon. Secondly, once a comprehensive policy  statement  on
this issue has been finalised within the next four months, a Black  Economic
Empowerment Council  will  be  established,  bringing  together  Government,
other experts and practitioners in this critical area.  Thirdly,  Government
will, as an actor in the economic arena, particularly  with  regard  to  the
procurement of goods and services, re-examine its structures and systems  to
ensure that they fully meet the objective of black economic empowerment.

I would like to emphasised that the  task  of  this  empowerment  faces  all
sectors of our society, including the established business community. As  is
happening  in  the  tourism  industry,  progress  will  depend   on   active
Government leadership and co-operation from various sectors of the  business
community itself. In this regard I should like to thank Cyril Ramaphosa  for
the work he did to lead this team, ie  the  commission  that  produced  this
report. [Applause.]

A further challenge in ensuring an inclusive economy pertains to  access  to
microfinance. Many enterprising South Africans set out  to  establish  small
businesses, but are unable to do so through the formal banking  system,  nor
to acquire the training that they need. Khula and  Ntsika  were  established
to spearhead this, and they have been improving their work in the  past  few
years.

In order to ensure that the wisdom of the nation is tapped  effectively  and
that ideas are processed into practical programmes as urgently as  possible,
Government will continue with intensive consultations  on  microlending  for
the poor for purposes of income generation, working  with  experts  who,  by
definition,  should  include  communities  who  have  over  the  years   run
successful self-help financial schemes.
Combined with  this  initiative  will  be  a  comprehensive  review  of  all
institutions mandated to assist the small,  medium  and  micro  enterprises,
SMME's. Last year, Government announced a series  of  interventions  by  the
state to help speed up the rate of investment and job creation. This we  did
having come to the conclusion that the country  had  achieved  macroeconomic
stability. We should at the very outset make so bold as  to  say  that  that
conclusion stands.

The growth in our economy in 2001 is expected to register more  than  2%  of
GDP, a significant achievement given the global  slowdown.  Interest  rates,
though still high, are lower than they have been for  many  years,  and  the
same can be said about inflation. The deficit is  much  lower  and  combined
with revenue collection, which is above the set targets,  this  will  afford
us the possibility to increase expenditure  in  real  terms,  especially  on
such important areas as social  services  and  economic  infrastructure.  In
other words, barring the exchange rate,  all  critical  economic  indicators
have improved.

The changing structure of our economy for the  better  is  reflected,  among
other things, in the increase in manufactured  exports  and  the  fact  that
high rates of growth can be attained without undue pressure on  the  balance
of payments. We as a country are within our right to be concerned about  the
volatility in the exchange rate and the kind of inexplicable movements  that
we experienced towards the end of last year. A variety of reasons have  been
given in this respect, and we all await the outcome of  the  inquiry  headed
by Justice Myburgh, whom we wish to thank, along  with  other  commissioners
and their staff, for accepting the request to assist the nation  in  getting
to the root of this problem.

As Government, we are in no  doubt  that  the  sudden  depreciation  of  the
currency a few months ago is not a  reflection  of  systemic  or  structural
weaknesses in the economy as a whole. We will need to continue working  with
international financial institutions and developing countries to  fashion  a
global financial architecture that cushions so-called emerging markets  from
occasional market irrationality. On the whole, we should emphasise that  the
path of an open economy that we have charted for ourselves  is  not  up  for
review. As we find our way into the future, we shall not seek solace in  the
past.

The programme that we announced last year to pay particular attention  to  a
number of sectors of the economy will,  during  the  course  of  this  year,
continue to unfold in the areas identified,  such  as  mining,  agriculture,
telecommunications, tourism and  manufacturing.  Many  concrete  steps  have
been taken to speed up work in these sectors,  and  the  relevant  Ministers
will detail these in their briefings both to Parliament and to  the  public.
We shall here select a few areas for emphasis.

To start off with, a number of recent projects that  have  been  brought  to
our attention have convinced us that the future holds much promise in  terms
of direct investment. Mvelaphanda Energy, working with a consortium  of  two
American companies, has invested more  than  half  a  billion  rand  in  the
exploration of gas on the West Coast  of  our  country.  The  consortium  is
exploring an area covering approximately 8 million acres within  the  Orange
River Basin and has encountered excellent  gas  reserves  that  will  supply
this new form of energy to our country. [Applause.] There is  an  investment
that Mvelaphanda will announce soon of at least R5 billion  with  regard  to
the development of this gas reserve.

Furthermore,  a  joint  venture  between  a   black   empowerment   company,
Evertrade,  and  a  Nasdaq-listed   company   will   establish   waste   bin
manufacturing facilities  around  the  country  for  export,  with  earnings
estimated at about R1,4 billion in the next seven years.  Harmony  Gold  has
raised over R1 billion in foreign  investments  for  the  purchase  of  gold
mines  in  the  Free  State.  [Applause.]  To  these  we   can   add   motor
manufacturing companies, which last year invested in excess of  R2  billion,
an Irish clothing and textile enterprise and many others.

Interaction with  our  business  community  has  reinforced  our  confidence
regarding their commitment to the growth of our economy and  the  prosperity
of our society. In this regard we wish again  to  pay  tribute  to  a  South
African patriot and great leader of our people,  the  late  Marinus  Daling,
who departed from our midst last week. From the  interactions  we  have  had
with government and business leaders in the European  Union,  Japan,  China,
the US and other regions, including at the recent World  Economic  Forum  in
New York, it is quite clear that these trends will continue.

Critical in ensuring greater investment is the intensification of  the  work
to build economic infrastructure and lower  the  cost  of  inputs.  In  this
regard, progress has been made in finalising the ports policy  and  starting
the process that will see to improvements in their  efficiency.  The  Nqurha
Industrial Development Zone has been designated and work  on  the  port  has
started.

Despite  the  difficulties  experienced  during  the  course  of  the  year,
progress has been made  in  the  restructuring  of  the  telecommunications,
transport and energy sectors, as well as other areas of economic and  social
infrastructure, with  the  primary  aim  of  ensuring  efficient  and  cost-
effective service. In  this  context,  the  restructuring  of  state  assets
remains one of the primary areas of focus in the Government's programme.

One of the urgent tasks we have set ourselves is to finalise the setting  up
of a safety agency for our railways. In this context,  we  wish  to  express
our sympathies with the bereaved families and  the  injured  in  the  recent
train accident in Kwa-Dukuza, KwaZulu-Natal.

We are highly appreciative of the agreement that has  been  reached  in  the
transport sector, and Spoornet in  particular,  to  determine  the  kind  of
restructuring that enjoys the confidence  of  all  the  major  stakeholders,
including the trade  unions.  Steadily,  as  these  programmes  reach  their
critical mass, their impact on the lives of all  South  Africans,  including
in the area of sustainable job creation, will start to be felt.

The  partnerships  that  we  referred  to  earlier   contain   within   them
possibilities  for  massive  expansion  of  community-based   public   works
programmes. We also face the challenge of ensuring that the funds  allocated
to the National Skills Fund, Umsobomvu, infrastructure  and  the  employment
subsidy are spent with the  efficiency  demanded  by  the  actual  needs  in
society.

Experience over the past few months has raised the question  of  the  impact
of the rapid depreciation of our currency on the  lives  of  ordinary  South
Africans. It is a tribute to the changing  structure  of  the  economy  that
imported inflation has in recent years been kept to a minimum.

We should also congratulate the agricultural sector on the  work  that  they
have done to finalise the strategic  plan  for  South  African  agriculture,
which  addresses  all  the  complex  issues  of  research,  equitable   land
distribution, assistance to small farmers and  so  on.  Government  and  the
agricultural sector are  working  together  urgently  to  move  towards  the
implementation of the plan.

In a meeting of the joint working groups of Government  with  big  business,
black business, agriculture and labour  last  December,  it  was  agreed  to
convene as early as possible a growth and development summit to address  the
urgent  challenges  facing  us  in  the  economy  and  build   an   enduring
partnership in which all of us can lend a  hand  in  building  a  prosperous
South Africa.

A critical element of this engagement - at least a basic  outline  of  which
will have to be elaborated before such a summit -  is  a  social  accord  or
compact among all role-players. We need to ensure that each sector  lends  a
hand for higher growth, whose benefits can be  shared  equitably  among  all
South Africans. This will mean, among other things, achieving congruence  in
expectations and certainty in such matters as  inflation,  wage  and  salary
demands, rates of investments, positioning of  the  country  in  the  global
arena, our role in Nepad, job creation and poverty alleviation.
The approach to this critical initiative will be based, among other  things,
on the experiences already garnered in the  Millennium  Labour  Council  and
Nedlac. Achieving this compact is desirable if our economy is to develop  to
its full potential. More, it is necessary if our society has to  advance  at
the rate required by the social challenges that we face.

This spirit of service to society, Batho Pele,  is  what  guides  us  as  we
pursue the restructuring of the Public Service.  Though  slow,  progress  is
being made in negotiations with public sector unions as we try  to  forge  a
common understanding of the  challenges  of  change,  which  should  benefit
employer and employee, the public  servant  and  the  public  we  are  meant
serve.  Steadily, through practical  experience  -  for  instance  in  urban
renewal and rural development, in improving capacity in the Presidency,  the
clusters of Ministers and directors-general,  and  in  the  President's  Co-
ordinating  Council  and  other  institutions  -  integrated  governance  is
becoming a reality.

During the course of  this  year,  our  country  will  celebrate  the  fifth
anniversary of the adoption of the  basic  law  of  the  land.  This  is  an
occasion on which we pay tribute to those who led  the  negotiation  process
and the mass of our people who, ultimately, are the  true  midwives  of  our
democracy.

The interactions that we  have  had  with  various  communities,  especially
during the imbizo activities, demonstrate that the people's wisdom  in  both
policy development and implementation can only serve to enrich  the  quality
of  the  services  we  render,  to  make  people-centred  and  people-driven
development a living reality. One of the injunctions of the Constitution  is
that we must set  up  a  commission  on  cultural,  religious  and  language
rights, and we  have  already  tabled  legislation  in  Parliament  in  this
regard.

In accordance with  the  Government's  comprehensive  Public  Service  anti-
Corruption Strategy, we have introduced measures to ensure that the code  of
conduct is upheld and that  all  Public  Service  managers  are  subject  to
conflict-of-interest disclosures. To complement this, legislation  to  fight
corruption will be brought before Parliament during this session.

Among the matters that we will bring to a successful  conclusion  this  year
is the definition of the role  of  traditional  leaders  in  our  system  of
government. The consultations that have taken place across  the  board  have
laid the basis for framework legislation.

We will this year also finalise the restructuring of our national orders  to
reflect the art, symbolism and idiom of South Africa as  a  whole.  Work  to
build the Freedom  Park  Monument  will  start  this  year,  so  that  South
Africans and the rest  of  humanity  can  celebrate  this  important  shrine
symbolising the rich heritage of  our  country  and  the  evolution  of  the
earth, life and humanity and the struggle  of  part  of  that  humanity  for
liberty.  It is therefore appropriate that this monument is launched  as  we
approach the end of the first decade of freedom in two years time.  I  would
like to thank the Freedom Park Board for  having  appointed  the  hon  Wally
Serote to work as a full-time chairperson on the Freedom Park  Monument,  so
as to speed up the process. [Applause.]

What inspires us as we work  with  other  leaders  and  peoples  across  the
continent and further afield is to shape a new world, defined by  the  needs
of all humanity. We enter  2002  with  Africa,  through  its  representative
structures, having formally embraced the commitment  that  this  should,  in
actual practice, be the  African  Century.  Various  projects  envisaged  in
Nepad will start to unfold in parts of the continent, as we turn the  ideals
in this document into practical action.

During the course of last year our  commitment  to  Africa's  progress  also
found expression in the deployment of our sons and daughters in  uniform  in
Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the  Congo  and  Burundi.  We  did  so,
because we remain confident that our sister peoples in these countries  will
find solutions to their problems.

We are humbled  to  play  host  later  this  month  to  the  inter-Congolese
dialogue, which will  decide  what  happens  to  this  critically  important
country of our continent. In order to  ensure  that  we  stay  true  to  our
commitment to peace on the continent and other defence functions,  we  shall
continue with the programme to equip our National  Defence  Force,  in  line
with policies of the country adopted by its elected representatives.

In pursuit of stability in our region, we will work  tirelessly  to  support
the people of Zimbabwe in their quest to hold free  and  fair  elections  in
their country. It is in the interest of the people of Zimbabwe and,  indeed,
the whole region that the government that emerges from the  March  elections
is legitimate and enjoys the support of the majority. [Applause.]

In order to play our part in ensuring that this happens -  and  in  response
to the wishes of Zimbabweans themselves - we will, within  a  week,  send  a
multisectoral South African observer mission to  Zimbabwe,  led  by  Dr  Sam
Motsuenyane. I  am  informed  that  Parliament  is  also  ready  to  send  a
parliamentary observer team on the same mission. Clearly,  the  mission  and
the conditions that our teams seek to create are one and one only:  let  the
people of Zimbabwe speak through the ballot box! [Applause.]

Further, we wish to express our solidarity with our brothers and sisters  in
Lesotho, who are due to hold their  national  elections  in  May  this  year
after a long process of negotiations among themselves. This  year,  we  will
continue with efforts to attain peace  and  development  in  the  Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Angola and the Comoros. We shall  also  persist  with
whatever  we  can  contribute  to  ensure  that  the  destruction   of   the
Palestinian authority is brought to an end and that peace and  security  for
the Palestinian and Israeli child becomes a reality. [Applause.]

Again, we shall, during the course of this year, continue to strengthen  our
economic and other forms of co-operation  with  countries  of  the  European
Union, Japan and the rest of Asia, China,  the  USA  and  the  Americas,  in
pursuit  of  Africa's  development,  our  own  national  interests  and  the
interests of humanity as a whole. In  this  regard,  we  shall  continue  to
challenge  the  pessimism  that  expects  Africa  to  fail  in  any  of  its
endeavours, and the undeclared doctrine  of  collective  punishment  against
all Africans that seems to come into effect  when  one  or  some  among  our
leaders stumble. [Applause.]

We wish, once more, to reiterate our  solidarity  with  the  people  of  the
United States of America for the terrible events of 11  September  2001.  If
anything, our fervent hope is that this tragedy will  continue  to  reawaken
in all of  us  our  bonds  as  a  global  human  family.  Along  with  other
countries, under the aegis of  the  UN,  South  Africa  will  make  whatever
modest contribution it can in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.

The ingredients for faster progress on all fronts of  our  work  are  there.
The primary one among these is our collective appreciation that no one,  but
no one, can do for us what we should do for ourselves. [Applause.]  In  this
programme we lay out the main challenges that face us  in  the  coming  year
and beyond. What guides our approach is that each one of us  should  lend  a
hand in doing the simple things that will make a difference to the lives  of
especially the poor.

Together as a people, we have made great  strides.  The  successes  we  have
achieved make the clear statement that acting together,  we  can  and  shall
continue to push back the frontiers  of  poverty  and  expand  access  to  a
better life. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I join members in thanking the  hon  the
President. Members and guests should please remain  in  their  places  until
the procession has left the Chamber.

The Joint Sitting rose at 12:05.
