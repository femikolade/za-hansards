                                    ____

                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
                                    ____

The House met at 14:04.

The Speaker took the Chair and requested members  to  observe  a  moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr President, in my absence, I was  unable  to  join  in
the sentiments expressed by the House, but may I please be  associated  with
them and also wish you a very happy birthday.

The  MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  You  may  sing  a  song  now,  Madam   Speaker!
[Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: I will, on another occasion, Mr Manuel, when you increase  this
budget by a few hundred per cent! [Laughter.]  Order!  By  agreement,  there
will be no notices of motion today.

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move  the  resolution
as it stands in my name:


  That Rule 253(1) be suspended for the purposes of conducting  the  Second
  Reading debate on the Financial Advisory and Intermediary  Services  Bill
  [B 52B - 2001] (National Assembly - sec 75).

Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 1 - The Presidency.

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
Ministers and Deputy Ministers, hon members and  fellow  South  Africans,  I
have today instructed that the statement ``Life begins  at  60''  should  be
gazetted. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

This is, in particular, to spike the guns of  the  Leader  of  the  Official
Opposition, Tony Leon, who, as the  House  knows,  is  only  27  years  old!
[Laughter.]

I thank you very much,  Madam  Speaker,  for  this  opportunity  to  address
Parliament on the occasion of this Budget  Vote.  As  we  know,  the  Deputy
President will also address the House on a number of important  issues  that
he  deals  with  more  directly,  including   central   matters   of   moral
regeneration,  issues  relating  to  the  legislatures,   the   Government's
partnership with other sectors  of  our  society  on  questions  of  health,
including Aids, and various elements of our international work.

The Minister in the Presidency will address  the  House  on  our  programmes
relating to the situation  and  rights  of  people  with  disabilities,  the
promotion of gender equality, the rights  of  children  and  issues  of  the
youth.

This budget debate takes place during the middle  of  a  year  that  we  had
proposed should be characterised by the common effort of all South  Africans
to find ways and means by which they can lend a hand in the national  effort
to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access  to  a  better  life
for all.

We are pleased to note that many of our people have responded to this  call.
Tens of thousands have volunteered their time to  help  the  police,  people
with disabilities and the aged, to clean and paint  schools  and,  in  other
words, to give practical meaning to the call ``Vuk'uZenzele''. I am  certain
that this popular response puts an additional responsibility on all  of  us,
including our public representatives as well  as  our  public  servants,  to
occupy the front line and lead by example in our constituencies, other  work
and official  responsibilities,  always  guided  by  our  motto  of  ``Batho
Pele''.

As in the past, the current financial year has seen some important  positive
developments in the  functioning  of  Government  as  a  whole,  focused  on
improving the system of governance and its capacity to serve the  people  of
our country.

There is no doubt that we have  been  able  to  achieve  these  improvements
because of the selfless dedication of many men and women in the  public  and
private sectors. We would like, therefore, to extend a word of  appreciation
to these hard-working South Africans whose efforts will surely  bring  about
radical  transformation  in  the  lives  of  millions  of  South   Africans,
transformation to which we are all committed.

These improvements are also, to a large extent, the outcome of  partnerships
between Government, the  private  sector,  civil  society,  individuals  and
companies from  the  international  community.  As  hon  members  know,  the
Presidency engages different sectors of our society to strategise, plan  and
share ideas on the best possible ways of lending  a  hand  in  the  national
effort to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access to  a  better
life.

These engagements include ongoing meetings with  the  Big  Business  Working
Group, the Black Business Working Group,  the  Agricultural  Working  Group,
the Trade  Union  Working  Group  and  the  forum  with  national  religious
leaders. Our interaction with people representing  these  important  sectors
of our society has led to greater  understanding  and  appreciation  of  the
challenges we all face, and the need for all South Africans to act  together
in constructive partnerships that work to find  answers  to  the  challenges
that we face. Both our youth and the leaders of  our  academic  institutions
have requested that similar working groups be set up with  them,  and  steps
will therefore be taken to respond positively to this request.

As we have said in the past, in addition to the local partnerships,  we  are
privileged to draw on the advice and wisdom of members of the  International
Investment Council and the Presidential International  Advisory  Council  on
Information, Society and Development.

At the intergovernmental level, to give  effect  to  the  principle  of  co-
operative governance, we, of course,  have  the  Presidential  Co-ordinating
Council, consisting of the Presidency, all the premiers, the  South  African
Local Government Association and  the  Ministers  of  provincial  and  local
governments.

The improved co-ordination between the different spheres of  government,  as
well  as  among  various  departments,  has  brought  about  better   policy
alignment and proper collaboration on the delivery  of  projects.  This  has
also brought about many positive results that  include  the  more  efficient
management of budgets, as well as faster implementation  of  programmes  and
an improvement in the quality of outcomes of government work.

However, we are not blind to the  fact  that  we  still  receive  persistent
reports about serious deficiencies in some of our provinces, covering  areas
such  as  education  and  health.  New  interventions  in  this  regard  are
necessary, and will be made. At the same time, we will continue to focus  on
improving capacity at the local government level.

One of the urgent tasks facing all spheres of  government  is  to  build  an
efficient and effective Public Service that  will  deliver  on  the  targets
that are necessary for the transformation of our  society.  As  hon  members
know, this challenge has faced us for a considerable period of time.

We have to deal with the  inherent  limitations  on  the  structure  of  the
Public  Service,  particularly   the   skewed   deployment   of   resources,
insufficient training in certain key delivery areas,  lack  of  mobility  of
personnel and other related problems.
We have to embark on a transformation process that provides,  among  others,
for the following:  The  retraining  and  reskilling  of  personnel;  better
utilisation of scarce resources; equitable distribution  and  deployment  of
personnel throughout the Public Service and in all  parts  of  the  country;
effective co-operation between social partners on the implementation of  key
transformation initiatives,  and  an  unrelenting  focus  on  the  issue  of
corruption within the Public Service.

We are happy that the majority of the public sector unions have  now  signed
the transformation and restructuring agreement negotiated with the  Ministry
and Department for the Public  Service  and  Administration.  We  hope  that
everybody will work to ensure that  the  implementation  of  this  agreement
proceeds smoothly and that the benefits accrue to all the  citizens  of  our
country. As part of our commitment to improving the efficiency of our  work,
the heads of departments and senior managers  in  the  Public  Service  have
been reorganising their work to ensure an integrated approach to  governance
to improve service delivery, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Work is proceeding under  the  leadership  of  Statistics  South  Africa  to
develop integrated performance indicators to improve  the  effectiveness  of
our monitoring systems. We are therefore  considering  including  integrated
planning,  budgeting  and  implementation  in  this  area   of   performance
contracts for heads of departments  to  make  certain  that  this  important
aspect of our governance is not reduced to an optional extra.

As before, the Presidency has to  discharge  its  functions  of  leadership,
oversight and management, co-ordination,  mediation  of  conflicting  policy
thrusts, as well as monitoring of delivery.  Like  the  Presidential  Review
Commission, the Government is of the view that the Presidency requires  more
capacity to carry out these tasks  effectively.  In  this  regard,  we  have
assigned the chief executive officer of the GCIS, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe,  the
extra responsibility of heading  the  policy  unit  so  as  to  enhance  its
strategic planning capacity. At the end of his contract at Home Affairs,  we
will also be redeploying Director-General Billy Masethla to  the  Presidency
to reinforce our work in  the  areas  covering  security  and  the  criminal
justice system. [Applause.] We will continue to find ways of  ensuring  that
we bring on  board  qualitative  improvements  so  that  we  can  serve  our
citizens better.

A feature of Government has  been  the  regular  interaction  with  ordinary
people so that communities have an opportunity to  express  their  views  on
matters affecting their lives. Clearly,  this  has  been  an  enriching  and
learning experience for both Government and the people, and  has  reinforced
the level of commitment to a strong  popular  partnership  for  change.  The
Imbizo campaign, which has so far taken us to three provinces, has  deepened
the relationship between Government and the people in the  conceptualisation
and implementation of development projects and in  improvements  in  service
delivery.  Through  these  regular  interactions,  we  come  closer  to  the
realisation of the idea that the people shall  govern.  The  Imbizo  process
has brought to the  fore  the  immense  goodwill  that  exists  amongst  our
people, and emphasised the critical need constantly  to  engage  them  about
how best to meet their needs. It is necessary for all spheres of  government
continuously to assess whether they are delivering an effective  service  to
the people, and how further to ensure the  firm  participation  of  ordinary
people in the improvement of their lives.
We also have a pressing responsibility to enhance  the  performance  of  our
economy. It is important that we continue with our  interventions  that  are
aimed both at maintaining healthy macroeconomic balances and  improving  the
impact of our microeconomic reforms. Although we  are  still  confronted  by
many challenges to ensure that we increase the  growth  and  development  of
our economy, there is positive news  that  should  be  used  to  propel  our
economy to even greater heights. South Africa's GDP growth  figure  for  the
first quarter of 2002 was 2,2 %, just  above  the  market  expectations.  We
have one of the most liquid emerging bond markets in the  world.  Real  unit
labour cost has declined by an average of 1,8% per  annum,  while  this  has
increased by 1,5% in the OECD countries. The share of manufacturing  in  our
exports has continued to increase, with high-technology products  taking  an
ever-increasing share in these exports. The  excellent  performance  of  our
manufacturing sector, for instance, resulted in the  Rosslyn  plant  of  BMW
winning the European  Gold  Plant  Quality  Award,  beating  all  automobile
plants in Europe and the rest of the world. [Applause.]

Improvements in the economy and in revenue collection also made it  possible
for us to cut personal income tax by R8,3 billion this year.  I  would  like
to take this opportunity to salute both our businesspeople and  workers  for
what they have done to help us produce these  results.  [Applause.]  We  are
committed to working together with them in a constructive  partnership  that
must create the wealth we need to defeat the  poverty  and  underdevelopment
that continues to afflict millions of our people.

The next big challenge we all face is to ensure that  the  projected  Growth
and Development Summit succeeds in its goals. It is necessary that we  speed
up our preparatory work  in  this  regard.  This  must  also  encompass  the
important areas of black economic empowerment, small  and  medium  business,
micro-lending  and  skills  development.  Greater   confidence,   stability,
certainty and accelerated growth will surely be achieved as a  result  of  a
shared economic  vision  among  all  stakeholders,  reinforced  by  specific
agreements on  the  concrete  contributions  that  each  stakeholder  brings
towards the realisation of this vision.

Although Minister Pahad will deal in detail with  matters  relating  to  the
youth, I would like to make a few remarks on this important  sector  of  our
population.  We  address  this  House  during  an  important  month  on  our
calendar. The first of June was  International  Children's  Day.  This  year
there were many activities in  various  parts  of  our  country,  with  many
people from different areas of  life  celebrating  this  important  day  and
affording children the possibility of articulating their views and  concerns
about many matters that they face on a daily basis.

We would like to thank all the individuals and organisations that  organised
the various events that involved the children. The Presidency,  led  by  the
Office on the Status of Children, hosted about  50  children  at  the  Union
Buildings,  coming  from  different  schools  in   the   Gauteng   Province,
representing diverse  backgrounds  and  including  some  with  disabilities.
While this interaction with these future leaders of our country was to  mark
International Children's Day, it was also in part a response  to  a  request
from one of these children for the President to visit his school  where,  as
this young boy said, they engaged in political discussions  and  would  have
liked to meet the President to discuss many issues that  they  thought  were
important  to  them.  The  children  that  came  to  the   Union   Buildings
demonstrated a good understanding of the challenges they face, with some  of
these children asking for interventions to ensure that schools that  do  not
have toilets, running water and feeding schemes are assisted to  have  these
basic essential services.

Two days ago we marked National Youth Day in the  Free  State  Province  and
again interacted with our young people  through  the  national  broadcaster,
the SABC, as we commemorated the June 16 uprisings. These  engagements  have
conveyed a recurrent message, which says  that  there  are  many  among  the
young people of our country who stand ready  to  make  a  real  contribution
towards the building of a democratic, peaceful and prosperous South  African
nation, free from the poverty, racism and  sexism  that  have  characterised
our society for too long.

Through our programmes and actions, members  of  our  legislatures  who  are
elected representatives of our people, may want strongly  to  support  these
young people as they seek to position themselves as active  participants  in
the transformation process, not as whites or  blacks,  but  as  proud  South
Africans. As we know, the youth of our country were central  to  the  defeat
of apartheid.

Today, the challenges facing young people are different from those faced  by
their predecessors. The youth of today face a new enemy. This  enemy,  which
faces all of us, is  poverty,  including  underdevelopment,  illiteracy  and
lack of  skills.  Arising  from  this  come  the  challenges  of  drugs  and
gangsterism. In this regard, we clearly have to pay  even  closer  attention
to the calls of the youth on the Cape Flats to assist their  communities  in
ridding themselves of the twin problems of  drug  abuse  and  gangsters.  We
should also strengthen the hand of the National Youth Commission to  improve
its capacity to lead the youth in engaging the new challenges.

We are pleased that the Umsobomvu  Fund  is  already  carrying  out  various
activities  aimed  at  empowering  young  people,  which  include  providing
information and counselling  support  to  young  people  regarding  careers,
employment and entrepreneurship.  In  addition,  there  are  programmes  for
matric and tertiary  level  graduates  relating  to  youth  entrepreneurship
which, among others, deal with funding for microenterprises  and  small  and
medium  business.  We  would  also  like  to  commend  the  National   Youth
Commission which, in response to the Year of the  Volunteer,  has  mobilised
young  people  to  make  themselves  available  to  government  departments,
offering their services to take care of our  mature  citizens,  people  with
disabilities and those suffering from Aids and other debilitating diseases.

The fact that  this  programme,  Letsema,  the  Youth  Volunteer  Corps  for
Sustainable Development,  has  already  attracted  over  80  000  volunteers
demonstrates that our youth are ready and able to lend a hand to  push  back
the frontiers of poverty and expand access to  a  better  life.  [Applause.]
Some of these volunteers  will  participate  in  the  campaign  to  register
children who are entitled to receive the  child  support  grant,  which  was
launched during Child Protection Week and which  aims  to  reach  3  million
children by the year 2005.  They  will  also  participate  in  reaching  the
pensioners who should benefit from the R2 billion  made  available  to  meet
the backpay shortfalls we spoke of when we opened Parliament.

We were also happy to have participated, during the course  of  this  month,
in  welcoming  back  Mark  Shuttleworth,  one  of  our  young   enterprising
entrepreneurs whose actions and projects, I am confident, inspire our  youth
and will further encourage them to  pursue  and  excel  in  mathematics  and
science. Clearly, we will all agree that we have a duty  and  responsibility
to assist our young people to grow up in a South  Africa  that  is  free  of
racism,  free  of  prejudices,  a  country  that  cherishes,  nourishes  and
celebrates the good common qualities of all her people,  rather  than  allow
itself to be infected with the negatives that we find in our society.

Indeed, we have the pressing duty to confront  all  the  negative  attitudes
and actions of some among our people, which subtract rather than add to  our
collective effort to build a truly nonracial, nonsexist democracy,  in  line
with the  principles  enshrined  in  our  Constitution.  This  is  important
because, notwithstanding the divisions  and  tragedies  of  our  unfortunate
past, as South Africans, we hold  many  things  in  common,  not  least  the
reality of our shared destiny.

Two days ago, on Youth Day, we dedicated a site  in  the  Tshwane  municipal
area which will be the home of our principal national monument, the  Freedom
Park. Through Freedom Park, we will honour and celebrate human  achievements
and development in all the  different  areas  of  life.  We  speak  here  of
freedom in a holistic sense - freedom from the  adverse  impact  of  nature;
freedom brought  about  through  socioeconomic  progress  and  technological
advancement  and  spiritual  freedom  as  expressed,  for  example,  in  the
creative arts and literature, as well as political freedom. Through  Freedom
Park, we will relate the South  African  story  in  its  totality.  We  will
showcase our country as part of  a  continent  that  is  a  dynamic  and  an
exceptionally fecund entity that is home to some abundant  and  rich  fossil
evidence of the evolution of the earth, life and humanity.

Freedom Park will, therefore, be a narrative  of  the  importance  of  South
Africa in the long history of the evolution and development  of  our  planet
to which our country and  the  rest  of  our  continent  have  been  exposed
through the millenia.

It will relate the story of human evolution,  migration  and  homecoming  of
some these human beings and the conflicts and wars  occasioned  by  some  of
these earlier contacts, as well as events leading  to  the  freedom  of  all
South Africans, black and white,  and  the  new  challenges  of  building  a
united but diverse nation.

Freedom Park will also  make  an  important  contribution  to  the  goal  of
responding to the call made  by  the  TRC  for  the  provision  of  what  it
described as symbolic reparations.

We have an ongoing challenge, not only of building  a  new  nation,  but  of
uniting  behind  common  symbols  as  well   as   determining   the   unique
characteristics that fully describe us as South Africans. Obviously, we  are
all united behind our national anthem, flag and coat of arms.

Further, as part of this process of creating a  unique  and  unifying  South
African personality, we unveiled new national orders during the Freedom  Day
celebrations. These are  the  Order  of  Mapungubwe,  which  celebrates  the
ancient kingdom  of  Mapungubwe  and  will  be  awarded  to  South  Africans
citizens for excellence  and  exceptional  achievement;  the  Order  of  the
Baobab, which will be awarded to citizens for distinguished service  to  the
people well above and beyond  the  call  of  duty;  and  the  Order  of  the
Companions of O R Tambo, which will be awarded to heads of state  and  other
international personalities for peace, co-operation and  friendship  towards
South Africa. Further considerations will be given  to  additional  national
orders.

It is our  collective  duty,  I  believe,  which  includes  members  of  our
legislatures, to  ensure  that  we  popularise  our  national  symbols  and,
through these  activities,  simultaneously  begin  to  define  a  new  South
African identity.

Government is still awaiting  the  final  report  of  the  TRC,  which  will
further help with the process of healing the wounds inflicted on all  of  us
by colonialism and apartheid. The report should also strengthen our  efforts
of building a single South African nation.

I  was  very  pleased  two  days  ago  to  participate  in  a  ceremony   in
Bloemfontein of the renaming of Bloemfontein City Hall as  the  Bram  Fisher
Building. [Applause.]

The launch of Freedom Park, the unveiling the new national orders,  together
with the work of the TRC, should be seen as  important  building  blocks  of
our united but diverse nation.

In February this year, we  held  the  third  meeting  of  the  International
Investment Council. Apart from welcoming South Africa's achievements in  the
macroeconomy, council members expressed  satisfaction  with  regard  to  the
progress made in  starting  to  address  the  microeconomic  constraints  to
growth, which had been discussed at earlier meetings.

One of the critical issues raised by the council members was a  question  we
have mentioned in this House. This is the matter of negativity amongst  some
of us, and the negative image about our country being  communicated  to  the
rest of the world by a few of our compatriots. These  council  members,  who
are not South African, were deeply concerned and  puzzled  as  to  why  some
South Africans seem so keen to do great harm to their own country.

One of the challenges, therefore,  is  for  all  of  us  to  work  together,
irrespective of our political parties, to project the many  good  attributes
of our country and people, as well as the  positive  developments  that  are
taking place every day in South Africa. Therefore, we would  like  to  thank
the International Marketing Council, as well as those who lead  the  Proudly
South African campaign, for consistently working on  positive  messages  and
engaging  different  sectors  of  both  South  African   society   and   the
international community about the good things that  are,  indeed,  happening
in our country.
We have already briefed Parliament about the New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development. The Presidency, together with other departments,  has  provided
some  of  the  ideas,  support  systems,  personnel  as  well  as  financial
resources for the development of Nepad. My economic  advisor,  Prof  Wiseman
Nkuhlu, has  been  deployed  full-time  to  lead  the  continental  steering
committee of Nepad and its secretariat, which is now housed at the  premises
of the Development Bank of Southern Africa. Three  senior  posts  and  three
support staff for this programme are on the establishment of the  Presidency
as part of the contribution of our Government to Nepad.

I would like to thank Prof Nkuhlu and all those who have supported  him  for
their dedication, commitment and hard work to ensure that  Nepad  becomes  a
reality.  [Applause.]  Indeed,  Professor   Nkuhlu   has   made   us   proud
internationally by the manner  in  which  he  has  driven  this  vision  and
programme.

We are committing all these resources because  we  want  Nepad  to  succeed.
Furthermore, while the  relations  with  the  countries  of  the  north  are
important, this new partnership will succeed only if  there  is  strong  co-
operation amongst the African countries and  Africans  themselves  who  must
assume the  centre  stage  with  regard  to  strengthening  the  partnership
amongst themselves and  by  continuing  to  own  both  the  vision  and  the
programmes of Nepad.

In this regard we are, indeed, very pleased that  some  of  our  parastatals
and private companies are already torchbearers in initiating  projects  that
will ensure the regeneration of our continent.

About two weeks ago, we launched an undersea fibre-optic cable project  that
is spearheaded by Telkom as part of  our  efforts  to  promote  connectivity
between Africa and the rest of the  world.  This  project  will  link  Asia,
Africa and Europe, via South Africa, with landing points in 14 countries  in
West and Southern Africa, and will have the capacity to handle  5,8  million
simultaneous telephone calls between Africa  and  Europe,  and  6,2  million
calls between Africa and Asia. [Applause.] This will  bring  to  an  end  an
abnormal  situation  whereby,  for  Africans  to  phone  one  another,  even
connecting to neighbouring countries, the calls have to be  routed  via  one
of the former European colonial countries.

The project will provide West, Southern and Central African  countries  with
direct access to one another. It is hoped that  East  Africa  will  also  be
connected at a later stage. Currently, R3 billion flows annually out of  the
continent in revenues to Europe for calls made on the African continent.

The  new  cable  project  will  reduce  costs,  improve   connectivity   and
reliability and increase the capacity  -  all  of  which  are  necessary  to
achieve Nepad's telecommunication objectives in Africa.

In addition, the energy parastatal, Eskom, is also engaged in the  important
work of building an electricity grid between  the  West  African  states  of
Senegal, Mauritania, Mali  and  Niger,  as  well  as  power  generation  and
distribution in the east of the continent  in  Uganda  and  Tanzania,  which
will drastically improve the quality of lives of many Africans.

Sasol is also engaged in the important Mozambique-South Africa  gas  project
that will increase Mozambique's GDP by 20%. [Applause.] We  have  also  seen
leading  South  African  financial,  mining,  telecommunication  and   other
companies establishing businesses in a  number  of  African  countries.  All
these projects demonstrate that Africa can radically renew the lives of  its
people through partnerships between African countries, as  well  as  between
the public and private sectors.

Therefore, we are saying that, in this new  partnership,  the  collaboration
between and amongst the African countries and businesses is central  to  our
success. Of course, this does not mean we do not value our partnership  with
the developed world. The fact of the matter is  that  these  countries  have
large  volumes  of  capital  and  other  resources  that  we  need  for  the
renaissance of our continent. It is in this  context  that,  next  week,  we
will continue our engagement with the G-8 countries.  We  are  certain  that
this  engagement  will  produce  positive  results.  We  are  also   greatly
encouraged that the major international  NGOs  support  Nepad.  Arrangements
are being made to meet these NGOs during our visit to Canada.

At the beginning of July, we will transform the OAU into the African  Union.
South Africa will have the honour of hosting the first meeting  of  the  AU,
as well as chairing this important African organisation  for  a  year.  This
places a particular responsibility on all of us, because we have  to  ensure
that the African Union starts off on a sound and correct footing.

Parliament is already seized with this matter  with  its  special  committee
dealing with various elements provided for in the Constitutive  Act  of  the
African Union. We will need closer collaboration so that, as  South  African
public representatives, we move in the same direction that will  assist  all
of us to reach the required goal of enhanced  continental  co-operation  and
unity.

Again, in August and September this year, as the House  knows,  we  will  be
hosting the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Members will  be  aware
that  the  Ministerial  Preparatory  Conference  held  recently   in   Bali,
Indonesia, made significant progress  towards  reaching  consensus  on  what
should underpin sustainable development.

However, many issues remain outstanding. We have to find ways and  means  of
linking the decisions  taken  at  the  Monterey  Financing  for  Development
Conference in Mexico to the outcomes of the Johannesburg summit.

The matter of the circumstances under which  countries  should  have  common
but differentiated responsibilities also remains  outstanding.  The  failure
to find  consensus  in  Bali  on  some  of  these  issues  places  increased
responsibilities on ourselves as the chairperson of  the  World  Summit  for
Sustainable Development to ensure that a basis for  agreement  is  developed
between now and September. We will be starting  a  process  of  consultation
with the major groupings in the UN system  to  explore  the  possibility  of
finding that consensus.

We will shortly be visiting Brazil  to  attend  the  ceremony  to  mark  the
official handover of the World Summit for Sustainable Development  torch  to
South Africa. We have recently returned from the World Food Summit in  Rome,
where we sought to address the growing challenge of lack  of  food  security
in the world. Indeed, this is part of our struggle  against  global  poverty
and underdevelopment.

One of our objectives as a country is to make whatever contribution  we  can
to ensure peace and stability on our  continent.  As  the  hon  members  are
aware, we recently hosted the Inter-Congolese Dialogue at Sun  City  in  the
North West to assist the DRC to  achieve  lasting  peace.  The  Minister  of
Foreign Affairs has already reported on this matter.

We continue to engage different players in the Congolese conflict,  and  are
confident that, sooner rather  than  later,  the  people  of  the  DRC  will
achieve all  the  goals  they  set  themselves  during  the  Inter-Congolese
Dialogue. We will make a short visit to Kinshasa later this month to  pursue
these goals.

Last  month  we  visited  the  Comoros  to  attend  the  inauguration  of  a
democratically elected president. South Africa was asked by the OAU to  head
a regional initiative to assist that country to return to democracy after  a
military coup and the challenge of secession.

As an African collective we had to resolve the  situation  in  that  country
because, in reality, the problems that face the  Comoros  are  the  same  as
those afflicting some of the  countries  on  our  continent.  These  include
military coups, a struggle over scarce resources and fragmentation.

By addressing these problems and assisting in the  preparation  and  holding
of elections, Africa has demonstrated that it is possible to  overcome  what
may seem to be intractable obstacles  to  democracy  and  stability  on  our
continent. Obviously, this  experience  will  assist  us  as  we  deal  with
similar situations elsewhere.

The Deputy President  together  with  former  President  Mandela,  has  been
involved in efforts to stabilise the situation in  Burundi  and  assist  our
fellow Africans in that country to achieve democracy.  The  Government  will
continue to support these efforts.

We are honoured to have contributed whatever we could  to  the  efforts  our
neighbours in Lesotho made  to  return  to  democracy.  As  we  know,  this,
unfortunately, entailed the death of members of our National Defence  Force.
We hope and trust  that  the  instability  that  has  characterised  Lesotho
previously is now a thing of the past.

We are also encouraged by the prospect of a  lasting  peace  in  Angola.  We
hope that the people of that country, who have never  known  peace  in  more
than four decades, will, at last, be spared  the  indecencies  of  war  that
have defined their lives for such a long time. We stand ready to  assist  in
whatever ways possible so that  together  we  can  embark  on  an  important
course  of  economic  recovery  and  development.  At  the  request  of  the
government of Angola,  urgent  steps  are  also  being  taken  to  meet  the
humanitarian needs of people who are gathered at assembly points from  areas
previously controlled by Unita.

President Obasanjo of Nigeria and I have assigned  special  envoys  to  help
the people of Zimbabwe achieve unity and national reconciliation.  We  dealt
with this and other matters relating to Zimbabwe when we answered  questions
in this House last month. Suffice it to say that we  remain  convinced  that
the solutions to the problems  of  Zimbabwe  rest  with  the  leadership  of
Zimbabwe, with reference to both the ruling party  and  the  opposition.  We
hope that this leadership will live up to its responsibilities  to  its  own
people and the peoples of our region and the rest of Africa.

All these activities that we are engaged in  are  important  if  we  are  to
achieve the goal of the renaissance of our continent. We have no choice  but
to pursue them consistently and persistently until  we  create  a  continent
free of conflicts, of wars, of instability and of  poverty.  We  would  urge
all South Africans to join the historic partnership for the renewal  of  our
continent.

In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to this Parliament for the  role
it has played and is playing to contribute to the  common  effort.  Both  at
home and in other parts of the continent, we are engaged  in  all  of  these
processes as part of the effort to lend a hand to push  back  the  frontiers
of poverty and expand access to a better life.

Given the enormous challenges facing us when  we  attained  our  freedom  in
1994, many of us would not have imagined a  South  Africa  that  would  have
resolved the internecine conflicts and violence among her people by now -  a
country whose democracy matures with each passing day, a nation that  slowly
but surely overcomes a terrible past, and a people united  and  strengthened
by their diversity.

Some would have thought that we were mere dreamers two  years  ago  when  we
articulated not only the need for the renaissance of the sleeping  giant  of
a continent, but called on all of us to make this the African  century.  Few
would ever have imagined the reality of Africans, both on the continent  and
in the diaspora, forming a determined force that refuses to  be  conditioned
by circumstance any longer, no longer prisoners of history.

Yesterday we were privileged to spend some time with  an  eminent  group  of
African experts and academics in Pretoria, coming  from  all  parts  of  our
continent, full of ideas, energy and enthusiasm to see  the  new  revolution
represented by the African Union and Nepad, transforming our  continent  and
ensuring that Africans occupy their proper place among the  peoples  of  the
world. I am certain that these African patriots will add enormous  value  to
our forward march in  the  complex  struggle  for  the  renaissance  of  our
continent.

Next week we will address the G8 countries, not seeking  a  subservient  and
junior role, but creating  a  genuine  partnership  based  on  equality  and
respect for mutual benefit. We are pleased that we will participate in  this
meeting, coming from a country whose people have demonstrated  the  will  to
succeed, whatever the difficulties.

All our people deserve sincere thanks for all  their  efforts.  Through  our
hard work and through our commitment, I am certain that we will continue  to
amaze both ourselves and the rest of the world. [Applause.]

Finally,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  an  outstanding  South  African,
Mosibudi Mangena, for his re-election as  leader  of  his  political  party,
Azapo. [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, firstly, allow me to  wish  the
hon the President a very happy 60th birthday,  and  to  thank  him  for  his
generous shaving of eighteen years off my age. It is very  welcome  since  I
feel about a hundred years old these days! [Laughter.]

In a short time, the hon the President will go, as he indicated, to  the  G8
meeting in Canada to present the New Partnership for  Africa's  Development.
As we have made clear before, and I wish  to  do  so  again  today,  the  DA
strongly supports the ideas central to Nepad.

These, as I understand them, are as follows: that Africa must stand  on  its
own feet; take responsibility for itself and not blame others  and  not  beg
from others for its future; that it wants a relationship of  equality;  that
it wants Western investment and free trade with  the  developed  world  -  a
relationship, in other words, of equal partners.

For this reason, we also agree with the criticism which  the  President  has
expressed, very trenchantly and recently, of agricultural  protectionism  in
the developed world. Indeed, it is a curse and something that all  sides,  I
am sure, in this Parliament unite against.

Finally, we obviously support the strong and clear commitment  to  democracy
and good governance, with provision for  peer  review.  I  think  all  those
things are excellent, and I am sure they point us, as a  country  and  as  a
continent, in the right direction.

However, if we take a long, hard look at the  situation  in  Africa  and  at
home,  we  see  the  bad  things  such  as  poverty,  hunger,  disease   and
hopelessness which have an essential cause quite aside  from  the  extrinsic
factors that make them so, and that cause is  bad  government  -  government
that is often democratic in  theory,  but  authoritarian  in  practice,  and
government dominated by those who care  more  about  power  than  about  the
people they are meant to serve.

Nepad as a theory is excellent, but as T S Eliot reminds us:  ``Between  the
idea and the reality falls the shadow.''

I believe that the credibility issue of Nepad faced  and  failed  its  first
test in respect of Zimbabwe. For some reason, which we have not  dealt  with
properly in this House, the hon the  President  saw  fit  publicly  to  show
solidarity with Mr Robert Mugabe while  pursuing  what  was  called  ``quiet
diplomacy'', a factor that has been defended from  this  podium  many  times
before, even though the Chairperson of the ANC, the Minister of Defence,  Mr
Lekota, later described this policy as ``a failure.''

Then, faced with an election that was patently neither free  nor  fair,  the
ANC and the Government did their best to argue the opposite.

And finally, after massive pressure had been brought  to  bear  on  our  own
President by other Commonwealth governments, the  President  was  forced  to
back the Commonwealth verdict of  the  election.  What  does  this  mean  in
respect of the G-8, Nepad and the future?

The Japanese ambassador to South Africa put it recently, plainly,  but  with
characteristic politeness, and I wish to quote from his speech, that: It  is
truly said that one reality is stronger than a hundred  theories.''  And  he
went on to point out, and I quote: ``The G-8 feels very  uncomfortable  with
the conclusion of the South African election observation team report,  which
is so remote from the international majority view.''

I believe that is an abandonment of Nepad principles, long before  the  plan
has been launched.  And,  recently,  we  had  another  contribution  by  the
President which I also find myself - not just because  it  is  his  birthday
today - in respectful agreement with, when he  accused  the  governments  of
Western Europe and North America of, I quote: ``insufficient  concern  about
human life'', of not believing, and I quote: ``that the matter of hunger  in
the world is sufficiently important.''  Indeed,  it  perhaps  is  trite  but
necessary to observe that if hunger is  not  important,  then  nothing  else
really is. And in that respect, obviously, the President  is  correct.  But,
with respect,  he  is  only  half-right.  It  is  one  thing  to  blame  the
governments of the West for  not  turning  up  at  a  food  summit,  as  the
President did, but we also need to take a much harder look at ourselves.

Let us start with our own neighbour Malawi. Malawi  had  a  strategic  grain
reserve of 167 000 tonnes.  It  was  established  in  1999  after  a  bumper
harvest. Inexplicably, the entire grain reserve was sold  off  between  mid-
2000 and early 2001.  One  of  the  consequences  of  that  is  now  massive
starvation, a shortage and dramatically higher prices. It  gets  worse  than
that.

According to Malawian law, 60 000 metric tonnes  of  grain  must  always  be
kept in reserve, precisely for such times  of  crises.  But  this  too,  the
emergency reserve, has been sold off, apparently without reflection  in  the
public accounts of  that  country.  The  net  result  is  that  3,2  million
Malawians face starvation.

In  Zimbabwe,  perhaps  a  better-known  example,  cereal   production   has
collapsed by 67% since the 2000 harvest. Over the  same  period,  the  total
land area used for maize production by  large-scale  commercial  farmers  in
Zimbabwe has contracted by 62%. So two-thirds of the  previously  cultivated
maize lands have simply disappeared. The moral of the story is  simple:  one
cannot pursue a  policy  of  land  invasions,  harassment,  and  terrorising
commercial farmers  and  farm  workers,  and  still  expect  anything  of  a
harvest.

The Economist magazine put it plainly last week: ``Hunger is caused  by  bad
weather, but even more by  bad  government.  Well-governed  countries  never
suffer famine.'' And, therefore, I  think  it  is  absolutely  correct  that
Nepad puts good governance and democratic principles first and foremost.

The leading economist and Nobel prize winner Amartya  Sen  reminds  us  -  I
quote from his book, Development is Freedom:


  It is not surprising that no famine has ever taken place in a functioning
  democracy - be it economically rich or relatively poor.

Sen also reminds us that poor but  profoundly  undemocratic  China  had  the
largest recorded famine in history, when 30 million people perished  in  the
famines that followed the failure of the Great  Leap  Forward  in  1961.  In
contrast, poor, but fundamentally democratic India  has  not  had  a  single
famine since independence over 55 years ago.
I believe that  we  cannot  just  stop  at  countries  that  are  locked  in
starvation, hunger and famine. I think it is wrong that  our  President  has
made no criticism of the way President Nujoma of  Namibia  has  misused  his
party's majority to extend his stay in  power;  of  the  refusal  of  former
President Ratsiraka to respect the election result  in  Madagascar;  of  the
deeply flawed election which brought the President of Zambia  to  power;  or
of President Muluzi's unconstitutional attempt  to  have  a  third  term  in
Malawi.

The point is that Nepad will not get off the ground unless  all  governments
on our continent and in our region, in  our  terrain,  abide  by  acceptable
global standards of democratic behaviour.

With great respect, when the hon the  Deputy  President  took  issue  a  few
weeks  ago  with  people's  characterisation  of  the  Zimbabwean   election
results, and  complained  that  we  were  being  subject  to  some  kind  of
collective punishment, the  point  about  it  is  that  Nepad  itself  is  a
collective document, which has  collective  goals,  which  seeks  collective
sanctions.

If it is not that, then it is not anything at all and there  is,  therefore,
no meaning to the concept of peer review. What is peer  review  if  not,  in
fact, equals characterising and criticising other equals? So I found  myself
this afternoon on strangely familiar territory ... [Interjections.]

AN HON MEMBER: You are lost.

Mr A J LEON: No, no.  I  am  actually  found.  The  hon  member  is  in  the
parliamentary lost and found section. The  hon  member  has  given  us  five
minutes of his time today, and he has managed to tear himself away from  the
Middle East and come back to Southern Africa. That is wonderful.

However, let me say that this party, the DA, is, in fact, committed  to  the
vision and policy for Africa, often more so than the  ANC  is,  which  is  a
characteristically normal position for ourselves to find ourselves in  since
our party was always much more in favour  of  the  ANC's  last  grand  plan,
Gear, the Growth, Employment and Redistribution policy, than three  quarters
of the governing policy is or ever appeared to be.

I want to say that one of the  problems  with  Gear,  with  Nepad  and  with
democracy is that, very often, the attitudes at home -  the  President  drew
attention to them in one sense - undermine the principles of  Nepad  abroad.
The ANC's attitude towards democracy is not altogether  surprising  when  we
consider what happens here in our backyard. I think it is  time  that  South
Africa  woke  up  to  the  realities  of  the  ANC's   national   democratic
revolution.

I  have  never  understood  how  one  can  have  a  revolution  alongside  a
constitutional democracy, but I think that the ANC, and  we  owe  them,  ...
[Interjections.] ... well, I will be re-educated  at  the  camp,  no  doubt,
quite soon. We owe the ANC one thing which they do  not  get  enough  credit
for, and that is that the ANC is  very  candid  with  the  people  of  South
Africa. They actually spell it out in  all  their  documents  and  on  their
website. They have said they want hegemony. They want control  over  all  of
levers of power in society. ... [Interjections.] ... So at  least  they  are
frank about it. There is, of course,  a  difference  between  frankness  and
democracy.

Indeed, the effect of the national democratic Irish revolution is to  white-
ant our constitutional dispensation by transforming  independent  checks  on
the ANC's power into extensions of the party machine. Some will say this  is
being a negative alarmist, but those people  are  naive.  There  are  always
useful idiots who realise their mistake only when it is much too late.

Let us take a few examples of this. Firstly, cadre redeployment is  inimical
to the Nepad principle  of  good  government.  The  ANC's  policy  of  cadre
redeployment, adopted at its 1997 congress, is in full swing. It  is  now  a
commonplace of our politics that the ANC should treat the  state  and  parts
of civil society as mere extensions of itself.

I was intrigued  that  the  hon  President,  this  afternoon,  gave  us  the
interesting example of the Home Affairs  Director-General,  Billy  Masetlha.
What interested me about that was not so  much  his  redeployment,  but  the
extraordinary comment made by Mr Smuts Ngonyama in the Mail  &  Guardian  on
Friday. I will read it to the House.


  On speculation that Masetlha would be deployed to the ANC rather than  to
  the Government, ANC spokesman, Smuts Ngonyama, said this organisation had
  recommended that Masetlha be retained in the Public Service.

So it is the party, not the Public Service Commission and not  the  Minister
of Home  Affairs,  heaven  forbid,  who  dictates  what  happens  to  public
servants, and that is just one example. [Interjections.]

Secondly, transformation has been misused and abused as a  power  grab.  The
ANC has targeted the military, the police,  the  intelligence  service,  the
Public Service,  the  judiciary,  independent  bodies  and  the  opposition,
apparently, all of which are established in terms of the  Constitution.  All
these are levers of power that require subjugation  under  hegemony  of  the
ruling party. When the ANC refuses to accept that there is no such thing  as
democracy without centres of power completely independent from that  of  the
ruling party, we have a problem.

Characteristic of this approach, I  wish  to  put  it  to  the  President  -
because we do not often interact with each other in Parliament or  elsewhere
- is that the role of Parliament has been eroded and downgraded. If  Nepad's
principles are to take root and  flower  in  Africa,  then  surely  the  key
architect, South Africa,  has  to  lead  by  example.  [Interjections.]  One
cannot lead it  if  one  follows  the  worst  practice,  and  not  the  best
benchmarking, in regard to our own Parliament. I will tell members that  the
ANC does not have much regard for Parliament's autonomy  and  oversight  and
they will say: We expected that.

What happens when an ANC MP says that? Barbara Hogan put it recently, and  I
quote:


  At best, the way we are dealing with the budget is  perfunctory.  It  can
  almost be described as rubber-stamping.

[Interjections.] Then we  find  that  nothing  comes  to  Parliament  or  is
disposed of  with  any  consequence  from  Parliament  unless  it  has  been
approved by the ANC NEC or NWC. ... [Interjections.]

Ms N C DLAMINI-ZUMA: What is wrong with that?

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: What is wrong with it? The fact that  the  hon
Minister asks what is wrong with  it,  is  that  they  have  undermined  the
democracy of this  Parliament.  Question  time  is  a  joke.  Accountability
evaporates and the disdain of Government for Parliament is now apparent.

Another member of the governing orbit, the IFP, Dr Gavin Woods, put it  this
way when he gave up or was forced out  of  the  chairmanship  of  Scopa.  He
said:


  The executive has  become  increasingly  authoritarian  in  approach  and
  insists on getting its way, resisting scrutiny and oversight.

Hear! Hear! they shout. Shame! Shame for Nepad and for this country.

What happens here is reflected on the ground. If one goes  to  the  Northern
Cape, where I was over the  weekend,  one  is  told  in  municipality  after
municipality that one cannot get a  job  with  the  municipal  public  works
scheme unless one shows an ANC party card. [Interjections.] All I am  saying
is that we need a democratic practice abroad, on  the  continent  and  right
here at home. Every true democrat in South Africa,  no  matter  his  or  her
party orientation, has a duty to oppose that bid for total power. So let  us
be clear that democratising Africa and a democratic South Africa needs  more
opposition and less government. [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Modulasetilo, maloko a Ntlo  e  e  boitshegang  e,  borre  le

[Ms T R MODISE: Chairperson,  members  of  this  august  House,  ladies  and
gentlemen, best wishes to the President on his birthday. May  he  have  many
more days, and may he grow and live more.

Really, Mr Tony Leon does not want to grow up. He does not grow up,  because
when we arrived here he was  speaking  like  this.  Even  now  he  is  still
speaking like that, like a toddler.]

The fact that Barbara Hogan, a member of the ANC and the chairperson of  the
finance committee, stood up and said  that  oversight  must  be  emphasised,
does not mean that the ANC is autocratic. It actually  means  the  opposite.
It means that within these  ranks  we  are  free  to  talk  and  to  express
ourselves. If the hon Tony Leon had listened, if he had stayed  long  enough
in this House, he would have realised that some  of  the  chairpersons  take
their work in oversight as seriously as Ms  Hogan  does.  So  it  is  not  a
mistake that Barbara Hogan stood here and said that we must play  our  role.
[Applause.]

Some years ago, some of us defined democracy  as  simply  the  will  of  the
majority. This definition  has  broadened  with  the  realisation  that  the
enjoyment and exercise of rights and responsibility could  not  be  left  to
chance; that democracy is therefore the empowerment of  people  to  exercise
their political, economic and social rights and responsibilities to  realise
their destinies and that of the nation as a whole.

As matters stand now, we are  challenged.  We  are  challenged  because  our
children are raped; we are challenged because  domestic  violence  continues
despite the very good laws that this House has  passed;  we  are  challenged
because pornography invades  our  lives  and  the  lives  of  our  children,
attacks and erodes the  very  cornerstone  of  African  sentiment,  that  of
respect for the very young and the aged.

As we brace ourselves for the leap into the new Africa, the Africa  that  Mr
Leon is so sceptical about, the Africa that will  be  economically  vibrant,
that will  promote  human  rights  and  that  will  respect  its  women  and
children, we must make sure that not only our words but our  souls  continue
to praise and to strengthen ...

... tsona dithako tse temokerasi. Re e simolole mo gae mo. Re e simolole  re

democracy. We have to start it from home. We should start it and  instil  it
into the continent of Africa. [Applause.]]

We must choose the words of our songs and our poets. We must choose  not  to
die of hunger. We must choose not to listen to sceptics on my left. We  must
question the ills ... [Interjections.]

Mr A J LEON: [Inaudible.]

Ms T R MODISE: That shows how very illiterate the hon member  is  about  the
structures  of  the  ANC  and   the   democratic   processes   within   this
organisation. [Interjections.] We must choose not to listen  to  Tony  Leon.
We must choose to work and to  restore  the  values  and  standards  of  our
people. [Applause.]

father at home to remember and know that this television  is  his  or  hers,
and that he or she should rule it.

The regeneration of dignity that we are talking about means that  we  should
pull up our socks as a black nation.  We  should  pull  up  our  socks  and,
together with correctional services and the police, root out corruption.  We
should do away with nepotism and the  accepting  of  bribes.  We  should  go
back, like at the beginning of the year, when the Department for the  Public
Service and Administration conducted  seminars  where  decisions  were  made
that corrupt people who work in the Public Service would be  dismissed.  Let
us dismiss them. [Applause.] Let us dismiss those educators  who  get  drunk
and rape children. Let us dismiss those nurses who  steal  towels  and  ill-
treat the patients. Let us dismiss those  government  clerks  whom  we  move
from one department to the next ... [Applause.]]

... because when one starts talking about good governance in  the  abstract,
then one creates a problem, one creates a platform,  in  fact,  for  a  Tony
Leon to mess up. [Laughter.]

himself about Zimbabwe, forgetting what  they  have  done  to  Zimbabwe.  He
forgets the role that colonials have played in Africa when  he  claims  that
it likes to fight and to  starve  itself.  We  should  ensure  that  we  are
trustworthy. We should ensure that  we  raise  our  children  properly.  Our
children should not seek those  whom  they  can  look  up  to  when  we  are
available.]

Our children should not seek and hunt and read overseas magazines  for  role
models. They must find role models within the home.  Therefore  we  need  to
raise them in a way that ...

It is sometimes said that America obeys Coca Cola  and  McDonalds.  In  this
country we obey drinking. To bring back our dignity and that of  Africa,  we
should talk about reducing the rate of drinking because  many  ills  in  our
places happen because people are drunk. When  we  look  at  baby  Tshepang's
case, people were drunk. Events such as violence and the abuse of  women  in
our homes happen due to drinking.  These  children  who  have  succumbed  to
gangsters are getting drunk. Let us reduce drinking.

Let us unite as blacks.]

I am thankful, even if this thing scared me. We should  use  this  programme
that has often been spoken about, the one of building a new  nation  without
looking at building an educator, but one who is responsible. [Applause.]]

Mr E J LUCAS: Mr Chairman,  hon  President  and  hon  members,  I  begin  by
conveying the best from the IFP to the President  on  the  occasion  of  his
sixtieth birthday.

We are of the view that Nepad has translated the  President's  philosophical
vision  of  an  African  Renaissance  into  a  tangible  and   action-driven
programme which is broadly supported by the  majority  of  African  leaders.
However, we all know  that  Nepad's  success  or  failure  will  largely  be
determined  by  the  response  of  the  leaders  of  the  developed   world,
particularly the G8.

The financial and technical  skills  required  to  implement  the  plan  are
mainly located in the economies of the  developed  world.  These  resources,
principally  debt  relief  and  foreign  direct  investment,  will  only  be
unlocked if the leaders of the developed world are convinced that  doing  so
would be in  their  own  interests.  We,  as  Africans,  would  be  deluding
ourselves if we believe  that  assistance  from  the  developed  world  will
spring from an altruistic impulse to develop a veritable Marshall  Plan  for
Africa, or from a spirit of Pax Africana.

The bottom line is that leaders of the First World would  be  delighted  if,
by helping Nepad succeed, vast and new  untapped  markets  were  created  to
trade in goods and services. They would do so in the  knowledge  that  their
high levels of economic and technological competence would make them  highly
competitive. Policy-makers would argue that it is in the  developed  world's
long-term economic interests to assist Africa. We know that the First  World
will always consider their economic interests first. Huge subsidies such  as
the common agricultural policy and excessive  tariffs  are  imposed  to  bar
outside  competitors.  If  they  are  serious  about  assisting  Africa  and
alleviating poverty, subsidies and tariff protection must  be  rolled  back.
Otherwise, African  development  will  be  restricted  to  limited  internal
markets such as SADC, and we will not be able to enter  or  compete  in  the
most important and lucrative markets.

It is within  the  context  of  this  brief  sketch  that  the  much-vaunted
commitment by the G8 leaders to Nepad must be viewed. On the  one  hand,  it
would be in their interest to prise open  new  markets  but,  on  the  other
hand, it would serve their interests to limit access to their markets.  This
is no time for the President and his colleagues to go  wobbly.  Africa  must
take all it can from Nepad,  while  insisting  that  the  First  World  take
active steps to level the playing field. Failure to do so will render  Nepad
a stillborn initiative.

The President should also turn his attention to other core issues closer  to
home, if Nepad is to succeed. The South African economy is only  growing  at
half the speed necessary for a  developing  society  to  make  a  meaningful
impact upon poverty. The Government has still to  put  a  growth  policy  in
place, such as the growth policies that fuelled  the  phenomenal  growth  of
the dragon economies of  Southeast  Asia  after  the  war.  Faster  economic
growth is constrained by lagging fixed capital investments and shortages  of
skilled, entrepreneurial and competitive managerial personnel.

There is a need to clarify the role and status  of  traditional  leaders,  a
clarification which remains outstanding. The President's failure  to  fulfil
the promise to address this issue is clouding all  other  attempts  for  the
nation to move forward as one. This issue will not  disappear.  It  requires
bold leadership from the President, today.

There is a perception that Government is proceeding with  Nepad  as  an  ANC
initiative. It would be advisable to  include  other  political  parties  to
make this noble action one that is fully and truly supported by all.

Finally, a government can only succeed if state departments  are  adequately
funded. A government is only as good as the departments that  implement  its
programmes and objectives. The Government must provide the right  levels  of
funding for state departments to ensure high levels of service delivery  and
to fulfil the mandate that people gave it. I believe that,  with  the  right
policies in place and with the sure and certain  touch  of  leadership,  our
nation can be the very best. [Applause.]

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Hon Chairperson and hon  President,  this  year's  Budget
Vote of the Presidency takes place in  a  very  vibrant  atmosphere.  It  is
vibrant because the political horizon spells a realignment in  our  internal
political landscape. More and more South Africans are  starting  to  lend  a
hand in rebuilding the future of this country. Above  all,  because  of  the
decisive leadership of our President, Nepad is a  reality  which  will  push
back the frontiers of poverty on this continent of ours.
The time has come for many of our countrymen and women  to  make  a  choice.
The choice that they will have to make will be either to break out of  their
isolation or to stay in the fight-back kraal, and either  to  get  onto  the
playing field to join us in lending a hand and to create a better  life  for
all, or become martyrs of their self-inflicted paranoia.

Die politieke woede wat op die Anglo-Boereoorlog  gevolg  het,  is  verwoord
met die slagspreuk,  ``Gewond,  maar  onoorwonne''.  Dit  ten  spyt  is  die
Afrikaners met verskeie keuses gekonfronteer  die  afgelope  eeu.  Soos  Die
Burger dit onlangs gestel het: Soms het hulle  goed  gekies;  soms  het  die
omstandighede hulle in 'n slegte  keuse  ingedwing.  Ander  kere  het  hulle
opreg gemeen hulle maak die regte keuse,  maar  dit  het  duidelik  verkeerd
geblyk. Nog ander kere, en wat  die  tragiesste  is,  het  hulle  oopoë  die
verkeerde ding gaan staan en doen. Die aaneenlopende  politieke  keuses  wat
uiting gevind het op 2 Februarie 1990 was die regte keuse. Ek sê  dit,  want
apartheid was op die einde van die dag net die nierstene  van  kolonialisme.
Nou in 2002, met 'n politieke  herskikking  op  hande,  moet  die  Afrikaner
besluit hoe hy gaan reageer. Die Grondwet van 1993  sê  die  geleentheid  is
daar om dit nou reg te stel op die grondslag dat daar  'n  behoefte  bestaan
aan begrip en nie wraaksug nie; 'n behoefte aan herstel  en  nie  vergelding
nie; 'n behoefte aan medemenslikheid en nie viktimisering nie.

Die keuses aan alle kante van die politieke speelveld  wat  op  2  Februarie
1990 gevolg het, het vereis dat 'n mens met jou brein en nie met  jou  bloed
moet  dink  nie.  Dit  was  die  grootmoedigheid  van  swart  en  wit  Suid-
Afrikaners, maar veral swart Suid-Afrikaners, om die  pyn  van  die  verlede
opsy te skuif, ter wille van 'n nuwe gesamentlike toekoms, wat  sedert  1994
wêrelwye respek en bewondering vir ons besorg het. Nou in 2002 mag  ons  nie
hierdie bal laat val nie. Nou moet ons kies vir Suid-Afrika  en  Afrika.  'n
Nuwe speelveld in die politiek word nou betree.

Konfrontasiepolitiek  in  Suid-Afrika  het  teenproduktief  geword.  Ek  vra
vandag van die Afrikaners  om  nie  die  prooi  te  word  van  onrealistiese
beloftes van sommige die  opposisieleiers  wat  eintlik  net  die  mense  se
diepste rassevrese manipuleer  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die  DA  is  mos  in
sprekende   voorbeeld   van   beginsellose   leierskap    en    beginsellose
opportunisme. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die ander sogenaamde Afrikanerpartye is  die
een mislukking na die ander, en hulle sukkel nou nog met die  sooibrand  van
hul politieke verlede en hul onbeholpenheid om aan te pas  in  hierdie  nuwe
Suid-Afrika van ons. [Applous.]

Die eksklusief witoorheersde debat  om  'n  sterk  opposisie  tot  stand  te
bring, is maar net nog 'n hersenskim soos so baie  ander  onhaalbare  ideale
wat in hierdie land nagejaag is. Trouens, ek  voorspel  vandag  dat  hierdie
debat van 'n sterk wit opposisie maar net weer  gaan  lei  tot  'n  volgende
rondte van wit Afrikaners se ontnugtering.  Vermy  hierdie  slaggat,  is  my
versoek aan my Afrikanerbroers en  -susters,  want  as  Afrikaners  inwaarts
gaan migreer in hierdie land, sal hulle toeskouers en  vreemdelinge  in  hul
eie vaderland wees. [Applous.]

President Mbeki, Oudpresident Mandela en die  ANC-leierskap  het  die  deure
vir Afrikaanssprekendes na die ANC oopgemaak.  Ek  en  baie  ander  het  die
geleentheid benut, want  ons  hart  is  vas  aan  Afrika.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
Trouens, ons Afrikaners  wat  gebreek  het  met  die  uitgediende  politieke
denkpatrone en by die ANC aangesluit het,  is  bevryde  mense.  Ons  aanvaar
onsself as Afrikane en ook deel van Afrika. [Tussenwerpsels.][Applous.]  Ons
as  Afrikane  het  'n  gemeenskaplike  erfenis  en  deel  'n  gemeenskaplike
bestemming. Dit is nou wat die deur oop is vir 'n  fundamentele  herskikking
van die poltieke landskap waardeur ons demokrasie  net  verder  gekonstrueer
sal word. Die geleentheid vir 'n ruimte van  politieke  gees  doen  hom  nou
voor, agb Gibson. Die Afrikaner moet hom  nou  loswoel  en  losdink  van  'n
hartseer geskiedenis. Hy moet hom loswikkel uit die  hoek  waar  hy  sit  en
losbreek uit die Jerigomure waarbinne hy tans skuil. Die Jerigomure  is  mos
'n valse sekuriteit.

Gee eerder applous vir  'n  bestendige  ekonomiese  beleid,  vir  regverdige
wette wat almal oor een kam skeer en  gee  applous  vir  die  internasionale
respektabelheid en leierskap wat ons verdien het sedert 1994.  Kom  en  word
deel van die spelers op die speelveld en wend talente  en  vermoëns  aan  om
ander te help.

Dr C P MULDER: Voorsitter, is die agb lid wat  so  'n  groot  Afrikaner  is,
bereid om 'n vraag te antwoord?

Mnr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Voorsitter, aan die einde as ek  tyd  het,  vat  ek  hom
graag. Net nie nou nie.

Dr C P MULDER: Ek wag vir hom.

Mnr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Die Vryheidsmanifes van die ANC sê: Suid-Afrika  behoort
aan almal wat daarin woon - swart en wit. [Applous.] Hierdie  woorde  beduie
mos dat daar politieke ruimte en 'n tuiste vir die  Afrikaners  in  die  ANC
is. Gryp hierdie geleentheid aan en word 'n  bouer  en  'n  skepper  van  'n
beter toekoms in ons eie vaderland. Dit gaan verder as  mens  se  vaderland.
Dit gaan om die bevordering van belange wat oor grense op hierdie  kontinent
heen strek - belange soos die verligting van armoede,  om  geletterdheid  te
bevorder, om mense op te hef en, bowenal, om getrou  te  wees  aan  jouself.
Die Afrikaner moet heelhartig sy  kleim  in  hierdie  politieke  ruimte  kom
afsteek. Die uitwissing van armoede en  die  opheffing  van  die  mense  van
Afrika is mos in alle Afrikaners  se  belang.  Ons  moet  hierdie  brug  die
toekoms in, gebou kry.

Dit is nou die tyd  dat  die  gemeenskap  daar  buite,  gemeenskapleiers  en
minderheidsgroepe, die Jerigomure verlaat en hul  verantwoordelikheid,  soos
ons President Mbeki, wyer moet sien as net eiebelang. Mens kan  net  wen  as
iemand anders iets kan verloor. Afrika het  in  die  nabye  verlede  nie  'n
leier  gehad  met  'n  Afrikafokus,  internasionale  geloofwaardigheid,  die
kennis en vermoë om hierdie kontinent tot nuwe hoogtes te lei  nie.  Ons  is
geseënd in die President en om só 'n leier as  ons  staatspresident  te  hê.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek sluit af met 'n gedig deur H A Fagan,  wat  reeds  in  1963  oorlede  is,
``Nkosi sikelel' i-Afrika'':


  Uit duisende monde word die lied gedra.
  Ek sluit my oë, soos 'n serafskoor
  val daar duisende stemme strelend op my oor:
  ``Nkosi sikelel' i-Afrika''-
  ons vra u seën, o Heer, vir Afrika.
  Ek kyk, en sien die skare voor my staan:
  Zoeloe en Kosa, Soeto en Sjangaan,
  en ek, 'n Blanke - vele volkre, ja-
  almal verenigd om Gods seën te vra
  op net een tuiste, net een vaderland,
  want die Alwyse het ons saam geplant
  en saam laat wortel in Suid-Afrika.
  ``Nkosi sikelel' i-Afrika''-
  seën, Heer, die land wat vele volkre dra.

[Applous.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, op 'n punt van orde: Was die agb  lid  se
tyd verstreke?

Die VOORSITTER VAN KOMITEES: Ja,  sy  tyd  was  verstreke.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The political anger which followed the Anglo Boer War was expressed in  the
slogan:  ``Gewond,  maar   onoorwonne''   [Wounded,   but   not   overcome].
Nevertheless, the Afrikaners were confronted  with  various  choices  during
the past century. As Die Burger said recently, sometimes  they  chose  well;
sometimes they were forced by circumstances into making  a  bad  choice.  At
other times they were truly  convinced  that  they  were  making  the  right
choice, but it clearly proved to be the wrong one. At other times, and  this
is the most tragic thing of all, they were  completely  aware  of  the  fact
that they were doing the wrong  thing.  The  consecutive  political  choices
that found expression on 2 February 1990 were the right choice. I am  saying
this, because at the end of the day apartheid was merely  the  kidney  stone
of colonialism. Now, in 2002, with a  new  political  order,  the  Afrikaner
must decide how he is going to react. The Constitution of 1993  states  that
we now have the opportunity to rectify matters on the basis that there is  a
need for understanding and  not  for  a  thirst  for  revenge;  a  need  for
restoration and  not  retribution;  a  need  for  common  humanity  and  not
victimisation.

The choices on all sides of  the  political  playing  fields  that  followed
after 2 February 1990 required us to think  with  our  brains  and  not  our
blood. Black and white South Africans, but especially black South  Africans,
were noble-minded enough to put the pain of the past  behind  them  for  the
sake of a new  joint  future,  which  has  won  us  world-wide  respect  and
admiration since 1994. Now, in 2002, we may not drop this ball. Now we  must
choose for South Africa and Africa. We are  now  entering  a  new  political
playing field.

Confrontation politics in South  Africa  have  become  counterproductive.  I
want to ask the Afrikaners today not to fall prey  to  unrealistic  promises
by some of the opposition leaders, who are in  fact  only  manipulating  the
people's deepest racial fears. [Interjections.] Surely the DA is the  living
example   of   unprincipled   leadership   and   unprincipled   opportunism.
[Interjections.] The other  so-called  Afrikaner  parties  are  one  failure
after another, and they are still struggling with  the  heartburn  of  their
political past and their inability to adapt to  this  new  South  Africa  of
ours. [Applause.]

The  exclusively  white-dominated  debate  on  how  to  establish  a  strong
opposition is yet another pipe dream, like so many other impractical  ideals
pursued in this country. In fact, I want to predict today that  this  debate
of a strong white opposition will simply once  again  result  in  a  further
round of disillusionment  for  white  Afrikaners.  I  request  my  Afrikaner
brothers and sisters to avoid  this  pot-hole,  because  if  Afrikaners  are
going to migrate inland  in  this  country,  they  will  be  spectators  and
strangers in their own fatherland. [Applause.]

President Mbeki, former  President  Mandela  and  the  ANC  leadership  have
opened the doors of the ANC to Afrikaans-speaking people. Many others and  I
have availed ourselves of the opportunity, because we have Africa at  heart.
[Interjections.] In fact, we  Afrikaners  who  have  broken  away  from  the
obsolete political concepts and have joined the ANC  are  liberated  people.
We  accept  ourselves  as   Africans   and   also   as   part   of   Africa.
[Interjections.] [Applause.] We, as Africans, have  a  common  heritage  and
share a  common  destination.  The  door  is  now  open  for  a  fundamental
transformation of the political landscape, by means of which  our  democracy
will be built even further. The  opportunity  for  generosity  of  political
spirit is now presenting itself, hon Gibson. The Afrikaners must  now  break
away from a sad history. They must also emerge  from  the  corner  in  which
they are sitting and break away from the walls of Jericoh behind which  they
are at present hiding. The walls of Jericoh are surely a false security.

Instead applaud a stable economic policy, equitable  laws  which  treat  all
people equally, and applaud the international respectability and  leadership
that we have earned since 1994. Let us  join  the  players  on  the  playing
field and use our talents and abilities to help others.

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, is the hon member who is such a great  Afrikaner
prepared to take a question?

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Chairperson, if I have time at the end, I shall  take  it
with pleasure, but not at the moment.

Dr C P MULDER: I am waiting for him.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: The Freedom Charter of the ANC states that  South  Africa
belongs to all the people who live there  -  black  and  white.  [Applause.]
Surely these words mean that there is political space and  a  home  for  the
Afrikaners in the ANC. Take this opportunity and  become  a  builder  and  a
creator of a better future in our own fatherland.  This  entails  more  than
one's fatherland. It entails the promotion of interests that  extend  across
boundaries on  this  continent  -  interests  such  as  the  alleviation  of
poverty, the promotion of literacy, the  upliftment  of  people  and,  above
all, being true to oneself. The Afrikaner must come and stake his  claim  in
this political space whole-heartedly. The eradication  of  poverty  and  the
upliftment of the people of  Africa  is  surely  in  the  interests  of  all
Afrikaners. We must succeed in building this bridge into the future.

The time has come  for  the  community  out  there,  community  leaders  and
minority groups, to leave the walls of  Jericoh  behind  and  to  see  their
responsibility, such as that of  our  President  Mbeki,  against  a  broader
backdrop than just their own interests. One can only  win  if  someone  else
can lose something. In the  recent  past,  Africa  had  no  leader  with  an
African focus, international credibility, the knowledge and ability to  lead
this continent to new heights. We are blessed in having  the  President  and
such a leader as our State President. [Interjections.]

I conclude with a poem by H A Fagan, who died as long ago as  1963,  ``Nkosi
sikelel i-Afrika'':


  Uit duisende monde word die lied gedra.
  Ek sluit my oë, soos 'n serafskoor
  val daar duisende stemme strelend oor my oor:
  ``Nkosi sikelel' i-Afrika'' -
  ons vra u seën, o Heer, vir Afrika.
  Ek kyk, en sien die skare voor my staan:
  Zoeloe en Kosa, Soeto en Sjangaan,
  en ek, 'n Blanke - vele volkre, ja -
  almal verenigd om Gods seën te vra
  op net een tuiste, net een vaderland,
  want die Alwyse het ons saam geplant
  en saam laat wortel in Suid-Afrika.
  seën, Heer, die land wat vele volkre dra.

[Applause.]]

Mr M J C VAN SCHALKWYK:  Madam  Speaker,  yesterday  a  few  thousand  South
Africans decided to test the limits of their strength and endurance  in  the
Comrades Marathon. There was only one overall winner and there were only  20
gold medallists. Many people  who  started  the  race  did  not  finish  it.
President Mbeki is one of a few South Africans who, as a  young  man,  chose
to compete in the political equivalent of this race. As  he  celebrates  his
60th birthday, it must be  gratifying  to  know  that  he  has  reached  the
toughest points. He is not yet in the finishing  straights,  but  he  is  in
that part of the race where he has just encountered the steep hills, and  we
trust that he will continue to keep climbing at  pace.  We  wish  him  well.
[Applause.]

We are just passed the midterm point, and it  is  therefore  appropriate  to
reflect on the contribution of the Presidency to what we have achieved  over
the past three years. He has done  much  to  place  Africa  on  the  world's
agenda. In years to come, analysts will say that Nepad was  to  Africa  what
the New Deal was to the United States and the Marshall Plan was  to  Europe.
In some senses, Nepad is our continental GEAR.

There were two choices on how to react to the new reality  of  globalisation
and open economies. The one was to try to hide from these realities.  It  is
to the President's credit that he never chose the  soft  option  that  would
have done irreparable harm to our country over the long term.  Instead,  the
President has decided to be honest with the people of our country about  the
realities of the new world, hard as they may sometimes be. South Africa  has
ridden the wave of globalisation, taking in its stride the ups and downs  of
fluctuating currency values and inflow and outflow of  investment.  We  have
emerged on the other side stronger, more open  and  better  placed  to  take
advantage of the benefits of the new global world.

This initiative has led to the beginning of a fundamental transformation  of
the South Africa political  landscape,  that  is,  the  ever-growing  common
middle  ground  on  fundamental  questions  of  the   economy   and   social
priorities.

The new openness has also led to a situation  where  the  attention  of  the
world community is more closely focused on  events  in  South  and  Southern
Africa. If we do well, we will get credit. If  we  make  mistakes,  we  will
feel the brunt  of  international  disapproval  and  condemnation.  In  this
regard, we must be honest enough to admit that the handling of the Aids  and
the Zimbabwe issues has reflected poorly on our country and region. The  New
NP's views on these two issues  are  well  documented,  and  South  Africa's
standing in the international community  would  have  been  higher  had  our
positions on Zimbabwe and Aids not developed in the way they did.

It has become commonplace for South Africa and  South  Africans  to  astound
the world. Where other people lose  hope,  we  see  opportunity.  The  whole
world thought that the logical outcome of our  history  of  racial  conflict
would be a bloody revolution, but we  snatched  victory  from  the  jaws  of
defeat simply because we had enough leaders with the  generosity  of  spirit
and the ability to see the bigger picture. Instead of following the path  of
least  resistance,  and  exploiting  the  narrow  interests  of  people  and
communities, South African leaders in the  early  90s  took  the  road  less
travelled. We have again reached the crossroads  where  we  must  choose  to
either exploit the narrow interests of people and communities,  or  convince
people again to see the bigger picture.

There is an intense debate in the Afrikaans community - coloured  and  white
- which the previous speaker referred to, on their future role and place  in
South Africa. Let me for  moment  speak  as  a  member  of  that  community.
Afrikaans-speaking people are at a crossroads.  The  choice  is  simple  but
stark. It is a choice between a just existence or simple survival,  isolated
and insulated by old prejudices.  It  is  a  simple  choice  between  simple
survival or really living.

Dis 'n keuse om te oorleef, of werklik te leef.  [It  is  a  choice  between
survival and really living.]

It is about a mindset. It is about a  choice  between  a  so-called  ``fight
back'' approach or to contribute.  It  is  a  choice  between  isolation  or
participation, between talking South  Africa  down  or  believing  in  South
Africa. It is a choice between being partially  South  African  and  proudly
South African.

In a very interesting article in Die Burger newspaper last week, the  deputy
editor, Dr Scholtz, debated this very issue. He put it  as  follows,  and  I
quote from an English translation:
  Afrikaans-speaking people, like all other people, have no automatic right
  to exist as  a  distinct  group.  If  Afrikaans  speakers  do  not  offer
  something deeper, if the Afrikaans grouping does not  help  to  free  its
  people culturally and spiritually, and add meaning to the world  and  its
  citizens, then it loses the  moral  right  to  exist.  If  the  Afrikaans
  language and culture add something unique to the enrichment,  spiritually
  and materially, of the society, and if Afrikaans speakers choose to  live
  in justice rather than to just live in South  Africa,  their  experiences
  and life will be so much better.

[Applause.]

This challenge exists not just for the members of the  Afrikaans  community,
but for people from  all  communities  such  as  English,  Afrikaans,  Zulu,
Sotho, all South Africans. Therefore, the  future  of  coloured,  white  and
Indian, and Afrikaans-speaking  South  Africans  does  not  lie  in  placing
themselves apart and in a separate  geographic  Volkstaat,  like  some  here
propose. Equally, it does not lie in  a  psychological  Volkstaat,  isolated
from mainstream society, like some others here propose. It does not  lie  in
the arrogant superiority and aloofness of their cold version  of  liberalism
that will never understand hunger or poverty, nor  the  struggle  for  human
dignity that so many South Africans continue to experience. [Applause.]

The future lies in the contribution that we can all make to the  success  of
our country. The  future  lies  in  accepting  co-  responsibility  for  our
future. Something profound is  happening  on  the  South  African  political
landscape.

Let me take members back to what  happened  in  France  over  the  past  few
months.  The  underlying  cancer  of  superiority  and  prejudice   suddenly
culminated in a Jean-Marie Le Pen. Jean-Marie  Le  Pen  did  France  a  huge
favour because he gave arrogance and superiority a face. It is not  easy  to
understand the dangers of arrogance and prejudice in the abstract. They  can
too easily be disguised by clever soundbites and spin. But,  once  arrogance
and prejudice have a face,  people  understand  them  so  much  better,  and
rapidly turn away from that  brand  of  polarising  divisive  politics.  The
reaction to Jean-Marie Le Pen strengthened the middle ground in France.

South Africa has  produced  its  own  Jean-Marie  Le  Pen.[Laughter.]  South
Africans will turn their backs on extremism,  arrogance  and  prejudice.  It
may take some time, but it will happen. It has  already  started.  Over  the
next few weeks, it will  pick  up  further  momentum.  This  phenomenon  has
strengthened and will continue to strengthen the  stable  middle  ground  in
South African politics. [Applause.]

Although I will continue to be a member of Parliament as an NCOP member  and
be part of debates in Joint Sittings, this may be  my  last  speech  in  the
National Assembly for some time to  come.  [Applause.]  Therefore,  I  would
like to thank all my colleagues in my  own  party,  as  well  as  all  other
parliamentary colleagues for 12 years of robust political dialogue.  It  was
a wonderful time in my life.

I came here in 1990, a few months after F W De Klerk's  historic  speech.  I
was elected in a by-election after the NP - the DP withdrew, since they  did
not want to fight me then and they could not - fighting for the soul of  the
white community against extremist rightwing forces, had lost a string of by-
elections against the Conservative  Party  led  by  Dr  Treurnicht.  I  have
always felt proud to serve the people of this country in this  Chamber,  and
especially to walk in the corridors of our democratic Parliament.

Although  observers  of  Parliament  may  sometimes  be  very  critical,  my
experience has been that, most of the time, reason and common sense  prevail
here. I have been privileged to experience  history  in  this  Chamber.  The
swearing in of Mr Mandela as President was a moving occasion  which  happens
once in a lifetime, if it happens. The  adoption  of  our  new  Constitution
embodied, in law, the spirit of a new South Africa.

I have been privileged to see the best and worst of  human  nature  in  this
Chamber. Recently, much of the latter. I started out as a  young  member  of
Parliament right in the back corner. Because I was the  most  junior  member
of the then NP, I sat next to the official opposition of that time, the  CP.
Emotions were running high in the early 90s in this Chamber.  Every  time  I
took my seat, I would greet my CP colleague next to  me.  For  three  years,
his standard reply was ``I will only  greet  you  the  day  I  shoot  you''.
[Laughter.] That very same CP member of Parliament was  later  arrested  for
having planted a bomb at a school in Pretoria. Those  of  us  who  supported
change then, were shouted at in this  Chamber  as  traitors.  Unfortunately,
today we see echoes of this again.

Listening to the slur of traitor being levelled against some of us again,  I
get the feeling that we have been there  before.  But,  people  can  change.
That very same CP MP has now accepted the  new  South  Africa.  The  last  I
heard, he had started a business venture with a fellow black  South  African
and voted for a party that he fought tooth and nail all his life.

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: People can change. Even Mr Ellis can  change!  Maybe
not all of the members of the DP. [Laughter][Applause.]

Today, very few people even remember the CP.

Another morally expensive lesson that I learned in this Parliament  was  the
unceremonious suspension of then MP Jan van Eck, when he used  parliamentary
privilege to make  certain  allegations  with  regard  to  the  torture  and
disappearance of the late Stanza Bopape.
Mr A J LEON: You suspended him.

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: That's right. The reaction  of  the  majority  party
then was not to be  truthful  or  to  engage  in  debate,  but  to  use  its
parliamentary majority to silence and to suspend him for six months  without
a salary. Some of us younger members of Parliament were not  satisfied,  but
we kept silent, a decision I have often regretted.[Interjections.]

This experience taught me that  party  discipline  is  important,  and  that
parties exist because people make compromises. But, there comes  a  time  in
politics when one must stand up and let one's conscience  speak,  no  matter
what the price. Sometimes it is required of one in politics to stand up  for
what is right, even if  it  is  only  for  one  person.  The  real  test  of
leadership is whether  or  not  one  is  willing  to  apply  the  same  high
standards to oneself and to one's party that one so easily sets for others.

I accept the challenge to prove that the Western Cape  can  be  the  testing
ground for the new South Africa. In this province, we must and we  can  show
that the three largest communities residing here, coloured, white and  black
cannot only tolerate each other, but can  be  successful  together.  I  look
forward to that challenge.

I have appointed Dr Boy Geldenhuys to act as Leader of the  New  NP  in  the
National Assembly.  [Applause.]  Dr  Geldenhuys  is  a  true  South  African
patriot, and a gentleman with an iron fist who  commands  respect  from  all
corners of this Chamber.

In conclusion, in my role as national leader of the New NP, with  the  added
specific leadership responsibilities  in  the  Western  Cape,  I  will  work
tirelessly to keep our supporters part of the mainstream politics.  The  New
NP is determined and committed to help life  become  better  for  all  South
Africans. By moving forward into the future and  by  making  a  huge  effort
together, we can improve our common destiny.  Together  South  Africa  wins.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Mr Chairperson, the President  of  the  Republic,  hon
members, this debate is taking place during a celebratory  week  for  us  in
the Presidency. On behalf of the  nation,  I  wish  Comrade  President  many
happy returns. [Applause.]

Having recently turned 60 myself, I feel qualified to say:  Welcome  to  the
senior  citizens  club!  [Laughter.]  In  addition,  the  Minister  in   the
Presidency will be turning 63 on Friday, and  we  wish  him  all  the  best,
indeed. [Applause.]

It is in this buoyant mood that we participate in this  Budget  Vote  debate
today, in a spirit that says we have a lot to celebrate in what our  country
has achieved, while also acknowledging the challenges that still lie ahead.

What makes our collective load lighter in all the spheres of Government,  is
the knowledge that many South Africans are willing to play  their  part,  in
the spirit of Letsema and Vuk'uZenzele, to improve the quality of  life  for
all and, in particular, to push back the frontiers of poverty.

I would like to deal with a few matters relating to some of the  areas  that
the Deputy President is responsible for. Whilst there has been  considerable
improvement in the  process  of  introducing  Bills  to  Parliament  by  the
executive, an area that still requires more attention is the translation  of
Bills.

As hon members are aware, Bills have to be in two official languages  before
they can be debated in this House. Last year, 85  were  introduced,  all  of
them in English. Seventy-seven were translated into Afrikaans, and the  rest
into  other  official  languages.  This  does  not   assist   in   promoting
multilingualism, and is something that we need to give urgent attention  to.
[Applause.]

There has  been  an  improvement  with  regard  to  the  number  of  written
questions that are not answered at the end of the year. At the end  of  last
year, only 30 written questions out of  a  total  of  2  121  asked  in  the
National Assembly had not been replied to by the end of the  period  set  by
Parliament.

Obviously, we are aiming for a target of having no unanswered  questions  at
the end of each year, but,  we  must  acknowledge  that  this  figure  is  a
significant improvement from the statistics of the year 2000, which was  142
unanswered questions.

One of the events that captured the imagination of the South  Africans  this
year was the launch of the  Moral  Regeneration  Movement  on  18  April  in
Pretoria. This gathering of about 1  300  representatives  was  made  up  of
people from virtually all sectors of our society, right across the country.

Cabinet Ministers, Premiers, MECs,  councillors,  amakhosi,  representatives
from  business,  labour,  women,  youth   formations,   religious   sectors,
political parties, community-based organisations, NGOs  and  other  sectoral
representatives exchanged ideas  and  grappled  with  the  issues  that  are
affecting the moral fibre of the nation.

The launch of the MRM was indeed a unique South African  experience.  In  an
interactive programme, a former drug addict, a person living with  HIV/Aids,
a prison choir and a youth dance group expressed in different ways  a  sense
of hope in the midst of despair; of courage in the face of challenge and  of
commitment in the face of moral decay. They enabled us  to  see  that  moral
regeneration will come through affirming the dignity  and  goodness  of  the
human spirit.

I would like to thank all political parties in this House for their  support
of the launch, and  their  continued  participation  in  the  MRM.  The  co-
operation and collaboration on this nation-building project has reminded  us
of the importance of working together for the common good of our country.

It is important to emphasize that the launch was only  the  beginning  of  a
long process in which we all need to be ready to play a part.

A lot of work has been done since the launch. The emphasis  is  on  building
the movement, structurally and operationally. The MRM is  being  established
as a section 21 company, and staff will be appointed soon. If the MRM is  to
succeed, it has to exist in every province, town and village.  Towards  this
end, provincial moral regeneration committees  are  being  formed.  In  most
cases, these provincial committees are planning  similar  launch  events  at
provincial or regional levels.

Discussions are also continuing regarding the drafting of a Moral Charter  -
a suggestion that arose from the summit itself. The charter  will  certainly
be a statement of vision and commitment that will  capture  the  essence  of
what moral regeneration is all about.

We are pleased to notice that several moral renewal  activities  are  taking
place throughout the country. We visited the Northern  Cape  legislature  in
Kimberly recently for an interfaith religious parliament  called  to  search
for solutions to the problems of moral decay in that province. We will  also
return to the Eastern Cape legislature soon for their second interfaith  and
multiparty religious parliament.

We are arguably the only country in  the  world  which  has  confronted  the
issue of moral regeneration head-on, and in such  an  organised  and  united
manner. Once again, we are pointing the way forward on  issues  that  matter
most to humanity, and we need to acknowledge that.

The ANC's Election Manifesto of 1999 spelt out  clearly  to  the  electorate
our commitment to creating a better Africa and a better world.

We put the manifesto to the people and, on the basis of that, we received  a
resounding mandate to address, amongst others, the following matters in  the
current term: To promote  peace  on  the  continent;  to  foster  democratic
systems of government, respect for human rights and an  end  to  corruption;
to campaign for a  better  managed  global  economy  and  promote  equitable
economic relations for the Southern African  region;  to  advocate  strongly
for the relieving of the debt burden on the poorest countries of  the  world
- many of them within our own subregion.

In pursuing these goals, we said we  would  strengthen  our  ties  with  the
continent, build  stronger  relations  with  Latin  America  and  Asia,  and
consolidate our relations with the developed  countries.  That  is  why  our
country plays such an  active  role  in  international  affairs,  under  the
leadership of our President.

As Chief Albert Luthuli said in  1961  when  he  received  his  Nobel  Peace
Prize:


  Our goal is a united Africa in which the standards of  life  and  liberty
  are constantly expanding; in which the ancient legacy of  illiteracy  and
  disease is swept aside, in which the  dignity  of  man  is  rescued  from
  beneath the heels of colonialism, which has trampled on it.

Because there are some people who have been  unreasonably  critical  of  the
active role that this Government is  playing  in  the  international  arena,
particularly of our President, I thought it was  important  to  remind  them
that the President is carrying out the overwhelming  mandate  given  by  the
voters of this country.

I actually believe that these critics are trapped in  the  apartheid  laager
mentality, when the definition of international  relations  was  mainly  the
interaction   between   the   apartheid   regime   and   Transkei,   Ciskei,
Bophuthatswana and Venda.

It is this limited understanding of international  relations  that  provokes
such a response. In this era of globalisation, no country can look  inwardly
and think it can survive with no interaction with the rest of the world.

Part of our involvement is in the area of conflict resolution.  Through  the
New Partnership for Africa's Development, Nepad, and the pending  launch  of
the  African  Union,  a  concerted  effort  is  being  put  into  developing
mechanisms to rid the continent of conflicts.

We have been  attempting  to  play  our  role,  and  to  contribute  to  the
resolution of conflicts in some parts of the continent. South African  peace
initiatives in Burundi resulted in  the  installation  of  the  transitional
government in November 2001.

Negotiations  have  been  continuing  with  armed  groups  opposed  to  that
government with the objective of reaching a cease-fire agreement.

We have also continued with the strengthening of  bilateral  relations  with
other countries. The Deputy President co-chairs the bi-national  commissions
with Nigeria, Germany and Sweden. The enabling environment created by  these
commissions has contributed to increased engagement between  our  respective
countries. Nigeria-South Africa trade data indicate a  substantial  increase
between 1993 and 2000, with exports having  grown  by  more  than  200%  and
imports by 400%. Two-way German-South Africa trade grew by 20% in 2000,  and
more than 450 German companies in  the  country  employ  more  than  60  000
people. Swedish development co-operation has amounted  to  approximately  R1
billion since 1994. We value these relations a great deal  and  are  looking
forward to the meeting of the BNCs with Germany  and  Sweden  later  in  the
year.

Up until recently, South Africa has been described  as  having  one  of  the
fastest  growing  HIV/Aids  epidemics  in  the  world.  We   are   therefore
encouraged by the findings of the 2001 survey of  pregnant  women  attending
clinics  in  public  hospitals,  which  has  confirmed  that,  although  the
incidents of HIV are still high, it appears to have stabilised between  2000
and 2001.

We are continuing to intensify our response to the epidemic, as was  clearly
outlined in  the  17  April  Cabinet  statement.  We  are  intensifying  the
implementation  of  the  five-year   HIV/Aids   and   sexually   transmitted
infections strategy plan, and have increased resources in this  regard.  The
total budget, which was R350 million in 2001 to 2002, has been increased  to
R1 billion in this financial year, and will go up to R1,8  billion  in  2004
to 2005.

A critical element of our strategy  is  the  strengthening  of  partnerships
among all South  Africans  to  fight  this  epidemic.  This  partnership  is
embodied in the multisectoral South African National Aids Council.  We  have
also strengthened our own  structures  dealing  with  the  epidemic  at  the
highest level, with additional Ministers being  added  to  the  Presidential
Task Team on Aids, headed by the Deputy President.

Given the absence of a cure,  HIV/Aids  research  continues  to  be  another
strategic area of focus. We are very happy that the  recent  launch  of  the
African Aids Vaccine Programme in Cape Town emphasised the need for  greater
investment in this regard.

Allow me to use this opportunity to commend our doctors,  nurses  and  other
health workers for their sterling work  in  caring  for  HIV/Aids  patients.
Also worthy of mention  are  the  care-givers  in  communities  and  various
hospices  around  the  country,  most  of  whom  look  after  Aids  patients
voluntarily.

Some of the unsung heroes  and  heroines  of  the  HIV/Aids  battle  include
people such as Mr Patrick Titi of Guguletu whose  story,  published  in  the
Drum magazine recently touched my heart and, I am sure,  many  other  hearts
too. Mr Titi is caring for his friend, Mr Goodridge  Letsatsi  and  his  son
Itumeleng, who are both HIV-positive and ill.

It is through the actions of such people that we can  hold  our  heads  high
and say we are truly a caring nation. We also  gain  courage  when  we  meet
people living with the disease, such as  Musa  Njoko  from  KwaMashu,  whose
powerful testimony at the Moral Regeneration Summit brought the  reality  of
Aids to many  delegates.  Miss  Njoko  and  other  compatriots  living  with
HIV/Aids continue to be an inspiration to us, through the  manner  in  which
they challenge stereotypes about people living with HIV/Aids.

We were recently reminded of the evils of colonialism and the  human  misery
it brought through the story of Miss Sarah Baartman. This  daughter  of  the
Khoikhoi people was taken away from the land of  her  birth  and  became  an
object of display in Europe, in a most despicable and  obscene  manner.  The
return of her remains from France on 3 May was an occasion of  both  sadness
and joy, and her burial in the next few  months,  in  her  motherland,  will
restore our common dignity. In fact, Sarah Baartman will  be  laid  to  rest
for the first time since her death on 1 January 1816.

This simple yet powerful accession of the human  dignity  of  all  is  well-
captured in the Bill of Rights of our  Constitution.  The  return  of  Sarah
Baartman is a reminder of what freedom means to all of us,  particularly  to
those who were victims of colonialism and apartheid.

Promoting the dignity of South Africans is one  of  the  objectives  of  the
Commission for the Promotion and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities Bill, passed by  this  House  recently.
This is another important step to realise and celebrate our  diversity,  and
it will provide us with the means to further unite us despite our  different
backgrounds. It is a major step  towards  the  vision  encapsulated  in  the
words of Chief Luthuli in 1961, and I quote him again:


  Our vision has always been that of a non-racial democratic South  Africa,
  which upholds the rights of all who live in our country to  remain  there
  as full citizens with equal rights and responsibilities with all others.


  For the consummation of this idea  we  have  laboured  unflinchingly.  We
  shall continue to labour unflinchingly.

With these words in mind, let us strive to establish a caring  nation,  rich
in its diversity and outlook, and united in its commitment in the quest  for
a better life for all. [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Mr Chairperson, hon President  and  Deputy  President,  hon
Ministers and hon members of this House, firstly, allow me  to  congratulate
President Mbeki on his sixtieth birthday.  We  say  happy  birthday  to  the
President.

Ukhule ukhokhobe, mkhuluwa. [May you stay for ever young.]

Turning to the hon the Deputy President, I must say  that  I  was  impressed
with his singing at Peter Mokaba's funeral. In terms  of  our  culture,  the
hon the Deputy President  brightened  up  a  sad  occasion.  Peter  Mokaba's
funeral was well-attended and dignified. He deserved a proper  funeral  like
that.

This is especially as true  for  another  ANC  speaker  at  the  event,  the
President of the ANC Youth League, Malusi Gigaba, who attacked the Mail  and
Guardian for its reports on Mokaba's history.

It is perhaps worth remembering that the one-time  columnist  for  the  Mail
and Guardian's forerunner, The Weekly  Mail,  was  none  other  than  Jeremy
Cronin, who once described Peter Mokaba, Winnie Mandela,  Tony  Yengeni  and
myself as populists, and even suggested  that  some  of  us  were  apartheid
agents. It is, therefore, strange that now some  of  us  would  criticise  a
paper that we supported when the poisonous fountain pen of  the  hon  Cronin
graced its pages.

Indeed, it has become something of an instinctive preoccupation of  some  of
the so-called intellectuals in the ruling party to call  one  names  if  one
differs with them. One may even be  labelled  a  treacherous  serpent  whose
head must be smashed. However, we should all agree that the turnout  at  the
funeral indicated  that  people  recognised  Peter's  contribution,  despite
Cronin's assertion.

The Budget Vote before us reflects much more than the  nearly  R130  million
allocated to the Presidency itself.  It  is  in  the  Presidency  where  all
budgetary priorities are  ultimately  determined  and,  therefore,  we  must
today hold the President to account for the  priorities  of  the  Government
that he leads.

The number one priority in this country remains job  creation.  Government's
jobless economic growth policy, which is implemented at the  behest  of  the
Presidency, has left our children with a  dismal  inheritance.  The  economy
has shed millions of jobs. The so-called jobless growth  is,  in  fact,  not
growth but stagnation. It eats at the very heart of our  society,  replacing
hope with despair. It is unemployment that makes a mockery of  the  Bill  of
Rights. It is a massive problem that must be addressed urgently.

Frankly, a growing number of South  Africans  are  questioning  the  way  in
which resources in this country are being utilised and allocated.

The solution to the challenges facing  South  Africa  is  simply  to  commit
Government to investing in this country and its people. Instead,  Government
clings to an economic model  that  has  failed  dismally.  The  self-imposed
structural adjustment package  is  supposedly  practised  by  the  developed
world, and therefore Government insists that we follow suit.

The truth is that the  developed  world  continues  to  invest  billions  of
dollars in their own economies every single year. It is direct and  positive
intervention in their economies, because they will  not  allow  millions  of
jobs to be destroyed just to pander to the dictates of other countries.

The United States only recently passed legislation to  invest  trillions  of
rands in their agricultural  sector,  whilst  here  at  home  we  are  being
lectured on the effects of globalisation, yet Government spends billions  of
rands to procure weapons of war.

The pattern of the  uneven  distribution  of  resources  still  plagues  our
economy. Many rural people cannot understand how  they  became  second-class
citizens, as if the Bill of Rights only applies in urban areas. The poor  in
urban areas receive a housing subsidy while the same cannot be said  of  the
rural poor. It  is  not  unreasonable  for  rural  people  to  expect  equal
treatment under the Constitution. We should not forget that the rural  areas
are the breadbaskets of this country,  as  well  as  that  of  many  of  our
neighbours. Agriculture, along  with  ecotourism,  holds  the  potential  to
create thousands of sustainable jobs, and to  contribute  massively  to  the
economy of this country. The dams and power stations that urban people  rely
on are in the rural areas, but the rural communities have limited access  to
them.
We propose that resources should rather be pooled and  we  should  focus  on
assisting rural people to  become  viable  farmers.  Not  only  will  we  be
addressing the issue of hunger, but we will also be providing jobs.  In  the
process, ownership becomes an economic reality,  and  not  merely  political
entitlement or patronising charity.

The examples of how such strategies have successfully been  implemented  are
legend. One needs only to travel up  the  West  Coast  of  South  Africa  to
witness the irrigation schemes covering hundreds of  kilometres.  They  have
turned  a  barren  countryside  into  a  viable   agricultural   hub.   This
infrastructure  was  the  initiative  of  the  previous  regime  that   very
successfully addressed the so-called `poor  Afrikaner'  problem.  Government
should intervene by providing development incentives and  attract  investors
to the countryside. There are opportunities for agro-industries where  value
would be added to our agricultural produce.

At the turn of the 19th century, the rural communities in the  Eastern  Cape
and other provinces were the granaries of Southern  Africa.  We  can  revive
that culture by introducing innovative development initiatives in the  rural
areas. Rural development will reverse the flood from the  rural  areas  into
the cities, where there are  no  jobs  and  no  residential  or  educational
infrastructure. We have noted that the Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs has started to see the wisdom of such an approach, but she needs  to
be assisted with a bigger budget.

I further wish to address myself to the crucial challenge  of  education  in
this country. Education is crucial because the development  of  our  country
to meet the challenges of wealth and job creation hinges  on  the  provision
of quality and equitable education. Advancement of  education  in  order  to
enhance individual skills and the spiritual well-being of  our  citizens  is
predicated  on  academic  freedom  and  the  provision  of   an   empowering
educational environment with excellent research facilities,  an  environment
where there is an unhindered pursuit of the truth and development  of  human
potential.

At present, the national education policies of the  Ministry  of  Education,
which have been endorsed by Cabinet, are  at  variance  with  the  need  and
choices of the people of South Africa, the  disadvantaged  majority  on  the
fringes of society who have  been  the  butt  of  successive  discriminatory
policies of the previous regimes.

The  Education  Ministry's  document  entitled  ``The   transformation   and
reconstruction of the higher education system'' outlines the  objectives  of
the policy and, on the face of it, they are  captivating  and  there  is  no
apparent contradiction with the vision we have for  the  upliftment  of  our
disadvantaged communities.

Our point of divergence is the mode through which the Minister  proposes  to
advance his dream.  The  fatal  flaw  in  the  Minister's  strategy  is  his
preoccupation with cost, which is one of the key motivating factors  of  his
rationalisation plan. Consequently, there will be  a  radical  reduction  in
the number of  universities,  from  36  to  21.  The  merger  of  university
campuses and technikons gravitates around  the  existing  traditional  white
universities.

The black colleges are disqualified  because  of  their  apartheid  origins,
while the white institutions are preserved to  form  the  core  of  the  new
rationalised education policy. Only Fort Hare  and  the  University  of  the
Western Cape survived the  Minister's  onslaught  as  flagships,  presumably
because of their struggle credentials. The  University  of  Zululand  barely
survived by some inexplicable mercy. Our argument is  that  these  so-called
apartheid institutions happen to be located in key nodal points,  which  had
been neglected by the previous white government. The fact that they  emerged
out of an apartheid  rationale  does  not  divest  them  of  the  access  to
education  that  they  have  provided  to  the  periphery  or  disadvantaged
communities.

Mr J P CRONIN: [Inaudible.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: I would like to tell Mr Cronin  that  the  Ministry  should
have located these glowing transformation strategies at these  institutions,
transformed them into competent academic centres, developed  their  research
capacities so that they could be compared favourably with the University  of
Cape Town, where that hon member was perhaps taught, or with the  University
of  Pretoria,  the   University   of   Stellenbosch,   the   University   of
Witwatersrand, the University of  Natal  and  the  University  of  the  Free
State.

The technical education that the  Minister  plans  to  launch  would  be  an
additional element to meet  the  technical  skills  needs  of  predominantly
agricultural and rural technically  underserviced  communities.  I  wish  to
tell Mr Cronin that technical education should  not  displace  the  academic
content of these black institutions. What the  current  policy  does  is  to
create two  classes  of  people,  namely  the  urban,  predominantly  white,
intellectual aristocracy, and the all-black,  rural,  blue  collar  working-
class contingent. It is difficult to understand the reasoning that  the  new
policy caters for teacher training to meet the teaching needs when,  in  the
first place, it  was  the  Minister  himself  who  closed  down  historical,
credible teaching colleges in a  country  with  a  dearth  in  the  teaching
profession.

The  New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development  envisages  and  urges   a
partnership  between  Africa  and  the  G-8   specifically,   as   well   as
partnerships  within  Africa,  and  between  Africa  and  the  rest  of  the
developing south. Much emphasis and shuttle diplomacy have been  focused  on
the G-8. This northward-leaning leaves the  impression  of  another  begging
bowl scenario. We all have a responsibility to  allay  this  perception.  In
order  to  succeed,  we  must  demonstrate  a  clear  understanding  of  the
underlying economic power relations linking the  south  to  the  north.  The
transfer of political  instruments  to  African  governing  elites  has  not
resolved the unequal economic relationship inherited  from  colonialism.  We
ourselves have inherited an economic order which places our economy  at  the
periphery with an over-reliance in relation to the  core  economies  of  the
north.

Large South African businesses are  relocating  abroad,  and  there  are  no
guarantees that they will be balancing remittances in their home base.  This
pattern affirms that the old economic order is  still  alive  and  thriving.
Let us understand, therefore, that the engagement of Africa by the north  in
Nepad is driven by self-interest, not by  philanthropy.  It  is  imperative,
therefore, that we strengthen our internal African economies  and  establish
strong south-south trade links, which should  look  inwards  and  break  the
industrial imperial strangehold which carved us  into  parallel  spheres  of
influence. There is a  perception  that  the  authors  of  Nepad  are  being
prescribed to by the developed world to conform to their narrow  definitions
of what constitutes democracy and good governance.

We must be careful not to be prescriptive, and be  seen  to  be  brandishing
our constitutional model as the only  acceptable  political  formula.  Other
countries may well develop participatory political  institutions  which  are
perfectly harmonious and acceptable to their peoples.  That  does  not  mean
that we must be uncritical of latent abuse and corruption. [Time expired.]

The  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Mr  Chairperson,   hon
President, hon Deputy President, hon members and ladies  and  gentlemen,  it
is clear from the speech of the hon Holomisa that  he  does  not  understand
and appreciate what this  Government  has  done  with  regard  to  targeting
people in rural communities, and poor people in urban areas. If he  did,  he
would have understood the  Rural  Development  Strategy  and  Urban  Renewal
Programme and what their contents are, and what they seek to achieve.

Secondly, it is clear that he has not been  following  the  debates  on  the
land front to see that, indeed, we are starting to  address  the  issues  of
black farming, particularly in rural areas,  so  that  they  themselves  can
take part in the development of our society.

On the issue of Nepad, I hope that the hon Holomisa does not agree with  the
perception he says exists  among  other  people  that  those  who  were  the
initiators of Nepad are influenced by the north on what it is that we  want.
This is our plan. We have developed it and we shall implement it.

The present budget, in my view, is  an  expression  of  the  role  that  the
highest  office  in  the  land  plays  in  the  management  of   Government,
monitoring and overseeing the  implementation  of  government  policies.  In
this context, therefore, it is this office that epitomises  what  Government
is all about and what it does for its citizens.

In the state-of-the-nation address in February  this  year  in  this  august
House, the hon  President  gave  an  indication  of  what  the  Government's
programme will be  for  the  year  2002.  He  articulated  that  central  to
whatever we need to do  as  Government,  members  of  the  legislatures  and
citizens, is the fight against poverty and underdevelopment in our  country.
Today, therefore, our task is to look at how the allocation  of  the  budget
for the work of the Presidency will advance these objectives as outlined  in
February 2002.

Different ministries  and  departments  have  shared  with  this  House  the
achievements made in the implementation  of  programmes  in  the  past  year
during their budget debates.

Their reports have indicated that indeed we are, step by step,  moving  away
from poverty and that we are confronting the challenges  of  development  in
the many interventions we make in the  areas  of  macroeconomic  reforms  in
order to achieve economic growth by improving  the  levels  of  delivery  of
basic needs in a number of our municipalities by ensuring that  we  increase
access to social grants  to  those  who  are  poor  and  vulnerable  in  our
society,  by  ensuring  that  we  improve  the  human  resource  development
capacity of our people so that they can become creators  of  jobs,  and  not
become dependent and always remain those who need to be employed.

We have also ensured that our human settlements,  through  tenure  security,
continuously access the Government's housing  programme  and  land  delivery
programmes. Also, the fight against crime and corruption continues  to  give
all of us a sense of comfort that,  indeed,  we  are  creating  a  safe  and
stable environment for our people.

Collectively, we  have  also  noted  that,  indeed,  there  are  still  many
challenges that we have to address in order to  address  issues  of  poverty
and underdevelopment in our midst.  One  of  these  is  the  eradication  of
hunger in our society, the continent and the world. In an  ideal  world,  we
would all be food secure. However, our reality in this country,  Africa  and
the world as a whole, shows that we continue to have millions of people  who
go hungry and, in many instances, are effectively powerless to  resolve  the
problem alone.

It was, in part, due to the recognition of this complex  challenge  of  food
insecurity that the UN member states agreed to  include  targets  to  reduce
the number of people who are hungry  by  half  by  2015  in  the  Millennium
Declaration. The President has put the issue of food  security  and  poverty
eradication at the centre of the Government's  agenda.  He  has  done  this,
mindful of the politics of food  at  regional,  national  and  international
levels. The unequal power relations in society continue to  define  who  has
access to food and who does not.

The economic governance of  the  world  system,  to  a  large  extent,  also
determines who has  access  to  the  means  of  production  and,  therefore,
defines who can and who cannot have access to food.

The unfair trading arrangements and subsidies such as those of  the  EU  and
the US, which are skewed towards the interests  of  the  rich,  are  also  a
factor in defining what commodities can have access to  what  markets.  This
misuse of the world's resources is the fundamental obstacle to  development.
In my view, these are at the heart of the politics  of  food  in  our  world
today.

In South Africa we can say we have the wealth of  knowledge,  human  capital
and a favourable share of natural resources  to  attack  the  challenges  of
hunger. Through the President's own work in the Agricultural Working  Group,
we have been able to produce an agricultural sector plan where we  would  be
able to work as partners in reversing the challenge of  food  insecurity  in
our country. We also have a clear Government commitment,  expressed  in  our
policies  and  legislation,  as  well  as   institutional   frameworks,   to
progressively realise this basic need.

Our own  strategy  that  we  have  developed  and  articulated  is  that  of
empowering our society to have the capacity to do things on its own, and  to
change the situation for the better without becoming  perpetual  dependants.
It is for this reason that the Vuk'uZenzele campaign has  been  welcomed  by
many in this country, because it seeks to move away  from  the  notion  that
the poor cannot do things for themselves. It is this spirit of  Vuk'uZenzele
that has sustained many communities  in  our  country,  and  created  buffer
zones to starvation and famine in many rural areas. With  little  pieces  of
land and water, many homesteads have been able to make a living. It is  this
resilience that has led many amongst us to fight the notion that  we  should
continue to be baby-sat by those who  are,  in  part,  responsible  for  our
misery.

As the ANC, through the Constitution, we  asserted  that  the  socioeconomic
rights are as much a factor  as  fundamental  human  rights.  The  right  to
access  sufficient  food  is  one  such  right  that  is  enshrined  in  our
Constitution. It obliges the state to ensure that it  enables  its  citizens
to progressively realise their basic food needs. Through this intent in  our
Constitution, we have continued to improve our  capacity  to  implement  our
intervention strategies  to  deal  with  the  challenge  of  hunger  in  our
society.

Last  week  in  Rome,  heads  of  states  and  governments,  including   our
President, assessed how far we have gone in implementing the  1996  plan  of
action. All heads of states  and  governments  agreed  that  we  have  moved
positively towards dealing with the problem worldwide,  though  not  to  our
satisfaction. It became clear that we will have to have a shift in the  flow
of  resources  for  development  to  intervention  aimed  at  building   and
improving rural infrastructure.

In addition, we need a dramatic reduction in the  levels  of  direct  farmer
support in the developed countries in order to remove  the  trade-distorting
effects these resources have, whilst we at the same time create space for  a
self-supporting  growth  opportunity  for  agriculture  and  other   related
sectors in developing countries.

Finally, it needs to be clear that  the  responsibility  of  addressing  the
growing levels of poverty and disparity  in  income,  which  fuels  people's
vulnerability to hunger, needs to be explicit in the world's  programme  for
sustainable  development.  The   forthcoming   conference   on   sustainable
development will create an opportunity for us as a country to  again  assert
our belief that there is a link between the issues  of  environment,  social
development and economy if we are to talk about sustainable development.  We
need to move away from just acknowledging the importance of  food  security,
and indeed have concrete commitments from many  governments  in  the  world,
civil society and private sector, so that we can do something to change  the
situation.

There is no doubt that growth in agriculture has a higher multiplier  effect
on overall economic growth. It is in this context that we  ourselves,  as  a
people in South Africa, support the role that the President  has  played  in
the  development  of  the  New   Partnership   for   Africa's   Development.
[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson, the hon the  President  and  hon  members,  I
firstly want to say happy birthday to the President. May the Lord bless  and
keep him.

Many South Africans who have been following  discussions  and  news  on  the
African Union are aware that there are some  differences  between  what  our
President envisages for Africa and what the Libyan leader, Muammar  Gaddafi,
has in mind. In today's Citizen newspaper, it is reported  that  Mr  Gaddafi
has championed the vision of an ``Africa free of the shackles of  the  World
Bank, IMF and other institutions of international finance and  trade  as  an
attractive proposition''.

What we all want to know is whether our President and Mr Gaddafi managed  to
fuse their two concepts when they met last week, or what the  latest  is  on
this front? The President needs to have as many South Africans  as  possible
to endorse his concept and vision of Africa.  For  this  to  happen,  it  is
important that he does not leave ordinary voters behind. I agree with  those
who say Nepad and the concept of an African Union  have  not  been  properly
introduced to ordinary citizens on the ground. There needs to  be  a  proper
debate, not only amongst politicians and  intellectuals,  but  also  amongst
ordinary South  Africans  whose  lives  will  be  impacted  by  the  ensuing
relevant decisions.

During the past few days, there have been different reactions to  the  reply
that the Deputy President gave to our member,  hon  Cheryllyn  Dudley,  when
she read from a Love Life publication, Thetha nathi,  which,  amongst  other
things, advises young people to have oral sex. She further asked the  Deputy
President  whether  such  material  was  going  to  help  in  the   HIV/Aids
situation. His reply was, and I quote: ``I cannot  answer  on  wrong  things
that people do that are  unnatural''.  ``I  cannot  talk  about  that'',  he
continued to say.

This reply has left many people bemused, because of Government's support  of
Love Life. Why does Government support an organisation that  promotes  ideas
that undermine its values? Why should children be  expected  to  talk  about
what even the Deputy President does not want to talk  about?  The  President
must come out clearly on this issue. Does he agree with Love Life's CEO  who
is reported to have said, and I quote:  ``Oral  sex  is  emphasised  in  the
campaign as a safer alternative  to  unprotected,  penetrative  sex''.  What
about abstinence?  Why  is  our  Government  part  of  a  strategy  that  is
destroying the morals and future of our children? Why talk  about  the  need
for  a  moral  regeneration  when  leaders  in  Government  are   supporting
organisations that promote and defend moral degeneration?

The levels of rape of minors reported in our schools and  homes  have  never
been experienced to this degree before. In today's  Citizen  newspaper,  for
example, there is a report about three boys aged between seven and 11  years
who allegedly raped a six-year old girl at the back of her home in  Verulam,
north of Durban last week. One  hears  or  reads  about  babies  and  school
children who have been raped almost every day. When and how  is  this  going
to end? We need direction from the President.

I want to appeal to the President to love our  children  enough  to  protect
them from individuals and organisations that are destroying and  undermining
their  innocence,  especially  little  black  children.  Children  must   be
protected from  pornography  and  other  obscene  materials.  They  must  be
protected from  immorality  that  is  flooding  our  homes  via  television.
Displaying an age restriction on the screen does not help parents  who  have
lost the authority over the children to the state.  Some  parents  are  told
that it is a form of abuse  when  they  try  to  stop  their  children  from
watching such harmful  material  on  television.  Such  parents  are  caught
between a rock and hard place. What are they supposed to  do?  Such  parents
do require the help and intervention of our President.

I agree with the hon Thandi Modise who said that  research  has  shown  that
overexposure to violence tends to make children more violent.  I  must  also
add that exposing young children to immorality  and  promiscuity  will  make
them immoral and promiscuous. So, it is in the power  of  the  President  to
remove pornography from our television screens and stores. For the  sake  of
our children, we want to urge him to do it.

Established democracies such as America, the UK,  Canada  and  Australia  do
not have the kind of immoral filth that our  open  television  viewing  time
has in this country. So,  those  who  like  to  defend  such  filth  on  our
screens, cannot do it in the name of democracy. We love our children  enough
to say pornography hurts them, and it must therefore  be  removed  from  our
society.

In conclusion, sexual harassment within the corridors of  Parliament  should
not be tolerated either. One  of  our  members  was  recently  subjected  to
humiliating sexual harassment, and we  expect  Parliament  to  do  something
about it. There are many things that are said at the podium and in the  back
benches that we disagree with. Yet, we treat all members  with  the  respect
that they deserve.

I agree with the Speaker that it is worrying to  see  how  some  members  in
this House attack each other's person  instead  of  just  dealing  with  the
issues raised by the person. [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE  PRESIDENCY:  Chairperson,  Comrade  President,  Comrade
Deputy President and hon members, one of the  most  pressing  challenges  we
face in South Africa is to  root  out  discrimination.  The  battle  on  the
racial and gender fronts is being pursued with vigour,  although  there  are
serious setbacks from time to  time  and  some  people  in  the  public  and
private sectors could do far more in the cause. Yet,  there  is  ground  for
believing that, more  than  many  other  countries  in  the  world,  we  are
finally, though slowly, creating the reality of a  nonracial  and  nonsexist
democracy. For this we must, to a great extent, thank the leadership of  our
democratic statehood, visionaries such as O  R  Tambo,  Nelson  Mandela  and
Thabo Mbeki.

We  also  appreciate,  from  our  own  history,  the  futility  of  national
division, and this gives us inspiration to ensure that it will never  happen
again. However, we must  also  thank  the  ordinary  people  of  this  land,
particularly the youth, for finding  ways  to  get  closer  to  one  another
despite past divisions and the disruptive reality  of  unacceptable  poverty
amidst concentrated wealth. The unifying  experience  of  seeing  the  whole
nation enthuse over the soccer World Cup was stunning. We won as a nation.

Yet, race and gender are not the only discriminatory fields  where  we  must
focus our attention.

There is the question of people with disabilities.  They  have,  for  years,
suffered the indignity of being neglected and  excluded.  We  must  redouble
our efforts to put this right.

We have lived partway through the African Decade for Disabled Persons, 1999-
2009, as declared by the OAU. We seek African solutions to a world  problem.
And there are signs that disabilities are on  the  increase  in  Africa  and
that people with disabilities  continue  to  be  marginalised  as  countries
grapple with economic woes and civil strife.

Nepad offers the chance of real  growth  in  economies  and  improvement  in
social conditions and we, therefore, can see hope at the end of the  tunnel.
We are inspired to press on with Nepad with commitment and enthusiasm.

We have been actively engaging friends on the continent and  in  the  region
to ensure that the disability  movement  will  thrive.  The  Office  on  the
Status of Disabled People in  the  Presidency,  in  conjunction  with  like-
minded institutions, has been actively at work on this  in  the  past  year.
Not only were we one of the first countries to make known  our  support  for
the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of  People  with  Disabilities,
as reported on last year, but  we  have  also  been  engaging  international
friends and multinational fora on this important development to ensure  that
the fight for equality of people with disabilities  is  both  sustained  and
fully international. Discussions in this regard at United Nations level  are
at an advanced stage, and we are playing our role.

At the same time, Government encourages people  with  disabilities  to  make
their slogan: ``Nothing  about  us,  without  us'',  a  reality.  There  are
programmes to train city councillors in the new local government  structures
so that they would be willing and able to increase delivery of  services  to
people with disabilities. Councillors  with  disabilities  will  be  offered
training too. Disability desks are being  established  within  the  district
and metropolitan councils to achieve these objectives.
Apart from ongoing work to  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  Integrated
National Disability Strategy in all national departments and the  provinces,
a major challenge we  face  is  the  continuing  lack  of  awareness  around
disability in  general  and  the  rights  of  people  with  disabilities  in
particular. In this regard, the Office on  the  Status  of  Disabled  People
will, in the coming year, focus extensively on a broad  awareness  programme
to be implemented through partnerships with disability  organisations,  such
as the SA Federal Council and Disabled People SA.

The OSDP is engaged  in  similar  partnerships  to  ensure  that  the  broad
Government drive to register all people who qualify  for  social  grants  in
the coming year becomes a reality for people with  disabilities,  no  matter
where they make their daily living.

The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Quality of Life and Status  of  Youth,
Children and People with Disabilities has an important role to play, and  we
would appreciate all  the  support  and  assistance  that  resides  in  this
committee.

In terms of the lives and wellbeing of our  children,  we  remember  vividly
that children, many of them hardly in their teens, were instrumental in  the
fight against apartheid, and we salute those children, particularly in  view
of the heroism of young people in  Soweto  and  elsewhere,  commemorated  on
Sunday.

Today the  South  African  Constitution  strongly  promotes  the  rights  of
children, and their wellbeing is of paramount importance to the  nation.  We
have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the  Child  and  a  number  of
other  international  treaties,  such  as  the  Convention  Concerning   the
Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst  Forms  of
Child Labour.

We have also ratified the African Union Charter on the  Rights  and  Welfare
of Children. The African charter points the way to  important  regional  co-
operation. It is only when we work together as the  African  continent  that
we will be able  to  address  the  issues  that  plague  us,  such  as  war,
conflict, abject poverty and communicable diseases, including HIV and Aids.

We are poised to  bring  about  real  development  and  prosperity  for  our
country,  our  continent,  our  nation,  our  people,  and  especially   our
children. Nepad is  also  an  important  vehicle  for  the  advancement  and
sustainability of the rights of our children. We stand  convinced  that  the
only approach to ensuring the long-term protection of children's  rights  is
to integrally link political and economic progress with the  everyday  lives
of our children in a comprehensive and holistic manner.

Since South Africa's ratification of the Convention on  the  Rights  of  the
Child in June 1995, we have developed a national  programme  of  action  for
children. Our vision is simple: Put children first.

Our legislation and policies are in line with the Constitution, and some  of
the advances we have made relate to health care services provided  free  for
pregnant mothers, as well as for children under the age of six years.

I now come to primary health care. The Integrated  Management  of  Childhood
Diseases was  introduced  at  primary  health  care  facilities  to  address
principal causes of  childhood  illnesses  and  death.  There  is  also  the
expanded programme on immunisation, which has  succeeded  in  reducing  both
polio and measles close to elimination.

I apologise to Manto for taking all her things.

There is the  introduction  of  the  integrated  nutrition  programme  which
intends to improve the nutritional status of children ...

An HON MEMBER: What things?

The MINISTER: ... I meant her speech. [Laughter.]

... aged  nought  to  six  years  and  primary  school  children  from  poor
households, the aim being to provide them with a meal a day.

The Child Justice Bill, shortly to be considered by this House,  deals  with
children accused of crimes and it aims to, one, set a new  minimum  age  for
criminal capacity; two, ensure individual assessment of each  child;  three,
establish a special legal procedure and, four, provide for a creative  range
of sentencing options.

A comprehensive review of childcare legislation is underway,  including  the
important focal area of sexual offences against children.
The Moral Regeneration Movement, led by Deputy President Jacob  Zuma  -  and
he spoke about it earlier - includes reflection and planned  action  on  all
forms of abuse against children.

The public awareness campaign we have been engaging in to  ensure  that  all
people, notably children themselves, know what  their  rights  are,  is  now
well-established.

Similarly, on the first  Saturday  of  November  every  year,  we  celebrate
National  Children's  Day.  In  2001  we  moved  out  of   the   traditional
metropolitan centres to celebrate this important day on our calendar in  one
of the more rural and underdeveloped provinces. We  plan  to  continue  this
trend in 2002.

We are not only working at national level. The Office on the Rights  of  the
Child in the Presidency and the rest of the  role-players  in  the  National
Programme of Action  for  Children  will  further  engage  provinces,  local
councils and municipalities to establish local plans of action for  children
to ensure that implementation is real for  all  children,  no  matter  where
they find themselves.

The challenges we face remain, especially in the light of media  reports  in
the past 12 months on child and  related  abuse.  We  need  to  ensure  that
people are not only aware of  the  implications  of  our  Constitution  with
regard to the rights of children, but even more importantly, also  that  our
daily actions as Government, civil society and individuals  reflect  a  true
understanding and appreciation of the value of our children.

The Office on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  in  conjunction  with  the  NPA
secretariat will, in the coming year, engage role-players at all  levels  on
the possibility of  developing  a  comprehensive  South  African  Government
policy  document  to  chart  South  Africa's  specific  challenges  and  the
outcomes we envisage as we prepare to enter the second decade of democracy.

The Office on the Status of Women in the Presidency, as reported last  year,
continued with the training of gender focal points in  national  departments
and the staff members in provincial Offices on the  Status  of  Women.  This
work has  reaped  benefits  not  only  for  the  individuals  attending  the
workshops and training sessions, but  has  made  a  broader  impact  on  the
general strengthening of the gender machinery as envisaged in  the  National
Policy Framework for Gender Equality  and  Women's  Empowerment.  We  intend
continuing with this work until such time as all  stakeholders  have  gained
adequate competency levels for full implementation of Government  programmes
and activities in all three spheres.

A major focus of the work of the OSW in the  past  12  months  has  been  to
actively engage institutions and counterparts on the continent  and  in  the
region  to  establish  the  requisite  gender  focus  structures   for   the
implementation of Nepad programmes and the launch of the African Union.  One
of the challenges is the continued danger of the watering down of  important
advances made in Beijing.

Generally, our national and provincial institutions compare most  favourably
in world terms. Nine out of 27 Ministers, or 33,3%, are women. Eight out  of
14 Deputy Ministers, that is 57,1%, are women.  A  total  of  30,3%  of  the
National Assembly members are women  and  25,8%  of  provincial  legislature
members are women.

It is well-known that the ANC's record in  these  matters  is  enviable  and
there is warranted cause for pride. I  challenge  other  parties  to  follow
suit. [Applause.]  I  urge  MPs  generally,  and  the  portfolio  and  joint
monitoring  committees  in  particular,  to  see  that  all  parties   reach
acceptable levels in the defined time. If necessary,  let  us  look  at  the
question of whether or not we might not need  legislation  with  respect  to
this.

HON MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: When we march from the 2004  elections,  let
us be sure that our representivity will  be  the  envy  of  the  enlightened
world.  Precisely   the   same   goes   for   persons   with   disabilities.

In  the  next  two   years,   South   Africa   has   significant   reporting
responsibilities in terms  of  our  commitment  to  the  Convention  on  the
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the Commonwealth, the  OAU  and
SADC. [Interjections.]

The OSW, with the ongoing work in the policy unit in the Presidency, and  in
close co-operation with the rest of Government, the legislatures  and  civil
society, will this year put in place the necessary processes and systems  to
ensure that these reports truly reflect the advances made in the past  eight
years and the challenges we face to reach a real nonsexist and  gender-equal
society in South Africa.

Some of the early indications in terms of these advances  are  reflected  in
the recently released second edition of Women and Men in South  Africa  from
Statistics SA. Among  other  things,  it  indicates  that  we  have  seen  a
decrease in the numbers of women and the  distances  they  have  walked  for
access to fuel and water since  1995.  There  has  been  better  and  closer
access to clean water, as well  as  increased  numbers  of  women  accessing
work.

The challenges we face relate  to  ensuring  departmental  specific  gender-
policy documents and the  development  of  an  inclusive  and  comprehensive
national action plan to attain gender equity and women's empowerment on  the
basis of these policy documents. The OSW  will  do  more  work  and  consult
further in this regard during the coming year.

Last year, when we gathered here, it was reported that soon a framework  for
the sustainable development of young people would be adopted by  Government.
This year we are proud to report that Cabinet  accepted  a  national  policy
framework for youth development. It is a policy framework that  provides  us
with a clear indication of  the  areas  in  which  we  would  like  to  make
advances between now and 2007.

In this regard, the National Youth Commission has  been  playing  a  crucial
role, not only in popularising the framework among young people  themselves,
but also among all the other organisations and institutions focusing on  the
issues that affect the lives of our younger generation.

The NYC  has  established  strong  and  functional  relations  with  the  SA
National Youth Council and the Umsobomvu Fund to ensure that the  issues  of
youth unemployment, skills development, the involvement of young  people  in
agriculture and tourism,  as  outlined  in  policy  documents,  receive  the
attention needed to ensure implementation, and not only talk.

This year, inspired by the national call of Vuk'uZenzele, the South  African
youth, under the leadership of the NYC and  the  SAYC,  is  embarking  on  a
series of service  activities.  The  establishment  of  volunteer  corps  in
communities,  as  Comrade  President  himself  mentioned,  to  sustain   the
campaign on the practice of volunteerism beyond June  2002,  will  form  the
backbone of these activities.
We are continuing to engage national Government departments  and  all  other
role-players on the best possible ways in which to establish a  full-fledged
national youth service, one that will truly entrench the spirit  of  how  we
can lend a hand to build a better future.

Further to these activities, the NYC launched an updated version of a  youth
information guide, focusing on the  needs  and  types  of  information  that
young people do not readily find available, and which assist  them  to  take
full control and  charge  of  their  own  development  and  future,  through
accessing services and information that are already available.

The most serious challenges we face as Government with regard to these  four
specific  and  important  areas  of  transformation   -   gender   equality,
disability, the rights of children and  young  people  -  are  not  so  much
related to the policy and planning phases, but most importantly, to  how  we
can ensure that through the knowledge and experience we have developed  over
the past five years, the time  these  areas  have  been  receiving  specific
focus from the  Presidency,  is  truly  used  in  implementing  Government's
programmes across the board.
Indeed, how do we ensure that these focal areas become an integral  part  of
our  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  in  Government,  nationally,   in
provinces and at local level? The  Policy  and  Co-ordination  Unit  in  the
Presidency  will  work  closely  with  the  people  responsible  for   these
programmes and activities to ensure that whenever we look at  ourselves  and
establish how far we moved in preceding months and years, we  will  also  do
so through the lenses of people  living  with  the  reality  of  disability,
gender discrimination, the challenges of being young in South Africa  today,
and how well we have met our commitment to put children first.

Taking a broader look at South Africa and drawing on the research which  has
been done at Stellenbosch University in terms of real growth,  South  Africa
boomed after the Second World  War  up  to  the  mid-1970s  with  an  annual
average growth of 4,73% based on constant rand values  of  1995  and  taking
inflation out of the figures. In the period 1977  to  1994,  average  growth
fell to 1,56%.

However, from 1994 to 1999, the new  democracy's  economy  started  to  stir
with an average growth of 2,5% recorded annually.  Now,  in  the  two  years
from 2000 to 2001, the annual average growth percentage was 2,8%. This is  a
significant turnaround. Now let us take a longer  look  at  the  per  capita
income in constant rand terms. From 1975 to 1993, it declined by  11%.  Yet,
from January 1994 to 1999, it increased by 2,2%. Finally, in  the  following
two years, 2000  to  2001,  it  rose  by  another  1,6%.  That,  too,  is  a
significant bounceback.

So, in closing, let me  relate  to  the  hon  members  some  facts  about  a
remarkable country that I know of. Eight  of  its  universities  are  listed
amongst the top 200 research universities in the world.  Since  early  1999,
no fewer than four million people were given access to clean running  water,
and a total of seven million since 1994.

Electricity in the home is up from 58% of households in  1994  to  80%  now.
Rural electrification is up by 218% in  rural  areas  in  seven  years.  The
number of rural houses with electric stoves has  doubled  since  1994.  Home
ownership is up from 66% to 77% since 1994,  ie  1,5  million  family  homes
built and occupied. Seventy per cent of the people live in formal housing.

It  is  perceived  as  one  of  the  most  attractive  and  safest   tourist
destinations since 11 September. It has the  29th  largest  economy  in  the
world, the 27th largest population and  the  24th  largest  land  area.  ...

Mr D H M GIBSON: The most boring speech in the world!

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: It has one of the world's  most  progressive
democratic  constitutions.  It  is  the  sole  producer  internationally  of
Mercedes Benz Class C right-hand vehicles, and its BMW plant in  its  export
effort is ranked first among European plants for quality. It is the  world's
largest producer of gold and platinum, and it is the  second  largest  fruit
exporter in the world. Yes, I say to hon members and  those  negative-minded
members, that this is our very own  South  Africa,  our  very  own  country!
[Interjections.]

The above picture is an appropriate birthday present for  the  President.  I
say: Happy birthday, Comrade. To the President and the  Deputy  President  I
can only say: Welcome to the club of the veterans.

I  thank  the  GCIS  and  the  International  Marketing  Council  for   this
information. It remains for me to  offer  my  warm  thanks  to  all  in  the
Presidency who put dedicated shoulders to the wheel  in  the  cause  of  the
country, the Director-General, the Right Reverend Frank Chikane,  management
and all levels of staff and those  in  the  offices  that  fall  within  the
Presidency  dedicated  to  creating  a  better  life  for  those  who   have
disabilities, for women, children and the youth. [Time expired.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, today is President Mbeki's  60th  birthday.
My children  sometimes  ask  me  whether  one  becomes  more  optimistic  or
pessimistic as one grows older. Mark Twain said:  If  you  are  a  pessimist
before you turn 50 then you know too much, and if you are an optimist  after
you become 50 then you know too little. Well, I am 50 now, 10 years  younger
than the President, but I prefer the following definition of a pessimist:  A
pessimist is an optimist with experience.

My mother taught us to pay respect to older people. Anyone who is  10  years
older than you, you must call ``oom'' in Afrikaans. Therefore,

Geluk, oom Thabo. [Applous.] [Congratulations, ``oom'' Thabo.] [Applause.]]

Three times as many people, mostly whites, emigrate  from  South  Africa  as
immigrate to it. Since 1994, the  annual  emigration  of  professionals  has
been more than 50% higher than for 1989-1994 or 1994. Between 1/10, 1/8  and
1/5 of South Africans with a tertiary education now reside abroad. In  1998,
250 000 South African professionals were  working  in  the  US,  Canada  and
abroad. This is not only true for whites and only for South Africa. At  this
moment, more black academics and professionals from Africa are teaching  and
working in the US than in the whole of Africa.

I know that in certain ANC circles, the  reaction  is:  ``So  what?  We  are
better off without them!'' In the '80s the  reaction  in  Afrikaner  circles
was much the same. `People who run away to  countries  abroad  are  cowards,
unpatriotic, and traitors who cannot take the pressure. ``We are better  off
without them'', was the reaction in those days.

Unluckily, it is not that simple. If people in any  country  leave  in  such
large numbers, then something is seriously wrong. Whether it is the  80s  of
the old South Africa or the ANC  and  the  new  South  Africa,  there  is  a
problem. For the future success of South  Africa  and  for  the  success  of
Nepad, we must evaluate the reasons why people are leaving and  we  must  do
something about it. It is a very serious problem.

During a recent visit to the Netherlands and Belgium, I  was  often  invited
to come back home. With the  word  ``home''  the  people  meant  the  Dutch-
speaking countries. On my return,  I  wrote  an  article  for  an  Afrikaans
newspaper, Beeld, and I want to quote from it.


  The more I travelled abroad, the more I realised  that  my  heart  is  in
  Africa. What a strange longing for a  beautiful,  rough,  sad  and  often
  sorrowful country. Why is my heart in Africa? Is it  for  the  challenges
  Africa poses or is it only because of the beauty of our nature? I am fond
  of walking in summertime.


   I stayed in Britain for a couple of months. I visited China,  Australia,
  all the continents. I studied and stayed in the US for a whole year. They
  are wonderful countries, but none have a twilight and a sunset that could
  be compared to ours. Our blue, clear skies, the shades of  red  when  the
  sun sets and the shapes formed by the clouds ...

I am still quoting from my article.


  What can be compared to gazing at the stars in the Karoo while  pondering
  the wonder of God?


  Apart from nature, the challenges of Africa are also important to  me.  I
  like to watch the TV bulletins for the popular immigration  destinations,
  but they cannot hold my attention. The nature  of  their  challenges  are
  boring. They argue about questions - whether they have too  many  or  too
  few sheep, whether a cloned cow should be slaughtered or not, and that is
  the main news in those countries.


  My heart is attached to Africa but my mind sets conditions. I want to  be
  myself in Africa. Is that too much to  ask?  If  we  succeed  with  this,
  surely more people will stay. That is the big, brutal challenge as I  see
  it. If there is a place in the north of  Africa  for  Arabs,  with  their
  religion and different culture, then surely there is a place  for  me  in
  the south, even though black intolerants call me an Euro-African.

I heard from Azapo  that  we  can  now  become  members.  They  changed  the
white/black thing so maybe they have changed as well.


  You may say that I am arrogant but I do  feel  a  strange  responsibility
  towards  thousands  who  would  never  be  able  to  leave  South  Africa
  regardless of what may happen in the future, even if they want  to,  poor
  people and Afrikaners who experience discrimination at the moment.


  My father taught me one person at the right time at the right place makes
  a difference. I would like to believe that. I  grieve  for  every  person
  that emigrates because it is a loss  to  South  Africa.  But  people  who
  decide to stay and then only complain, moan and groan do not help at all.
  If you decide to stay, become involved. Do something yourself.

This is a quote from the article and  the  whole  article  can  be  read  in
Afrikaans in that newspaper.  Different  positive  letters  from  Afrikaners
abroad reading Beeld on the Internet followed my article. But,  last  Friday
there was a very sad one.  Cecil  Barnard  wrote  the  following  letter  in
Beeld, and I am going to read it in Afrikaans. He wrote:


  Ek het die Diaspora-artikels  gelees  en  met  vlam  en  energie  daaraan
  deelgeneem. Aan die intellektuele sy van  die  debat  was  dit  seker  Dr
  Pieter Mulder se artikel, ``Keer terug en doen  iets'',  wat  die  meeste
  harte diep geraak het.

Dan vertel hy hoe  positief  hulle  was  oor  Suid-Afrika  nadat  hulle  die
artikel gelees het en van sy kollega, Tienie Tolken en sy vrou Christa,  wat
entoesiasties beplan het om terug te keer na Suid-Afrika  en  'n  bydrae  te
maak. Met hul buitelandse geld het hulle 'n huis  gekoop  in  Kempton  Park.
Enkele aande  gelede  is  hulle  deur  vier  rowers  ingewag  en  Tienie  is
doodgeskiet - sommer so, boem, daar gaan jy! Die boewe is weg en  sal  seker
nooit gevang word nie.

Hy skryf verder:


  Vir my het die debat oor  immigrasie  emosioneel  in  die  harde  praktyk
  hiermee geëindig. Ek weet skielik, vol van woede, dat  ek  geen  begeerte
  meer het om terug te gaan en 'n  bydrae  te  lewer  nie,  behalwe  om  my
  huisraad in Suid-Afrika so gou moontlik te begin verkoop.

Dit is ons verantwoordelikheid as leiers om 'n klimaat te skep waarin  sulke
voorvalle nie plaasvind nie.  In  KwaZulu-Natal  is  Mnr  en  Mev  Dent  van
Wartburg die naweek vermoor. Hy  was  'n  bekende  boer  van  die  omgewing.
Ongeveer  dieselfde  tyd  het  'n  jeugverteenwoordiger  van   die   VF   'n
jeugparlement in Galeshewe  in  Kimberley  bygewoon.  Die  ANC-jeuglede  het
telkens ``Kill the  boer!  Kill  the  farmer!  gedreunsing'',  wat  die  VF-
jeuglid, wat oor samewerking en versoening wou gaan praat het, so  ontnugter
het dat sy toestemming gevra het om dit nie verder by te woon nie.  Ons  het
reeds 'n klagte daaroor gelê.

Dis die verantwoordelikheid van alle politieke leiers om hul  volgelinge  op
te voed en te dissiplineer. As hul gedrag rassisme en  haatspraak  bevorder,
is dit ons almal se verantwoordelikheid. Die VF het  reeds  in  die  verlede
verskeie  mediaverklarings  uitgereik  waarin  Afrikaners  oor  rassisme  en
haatspraak gekritiseer is.

Geen begrafnis van 'n boer is nog gepolitiseer nie. Tog bly die vraag  -  en
dit is 'n harde vraag - wat sal die  reaksie  van  die  ANC-leiers  wees  as
boere  tydens  die  begrafnis  van  die  Dent-egpaar  wat  hierdie  Saterdag
plaasvind, sal dreunsing,`` Kill the Xhosa! Kill the black  man''?  Kan  ons
oor die implikasie daarvan dink en wat die effek daarvan na  almal  se  kant
toe sal wees? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Then he said how positive they were about South Africa after they had  read
the article, and told about his colleague,  Tienie  Tolken,  and  his  wife,
Christa, who planned enthusiastically to return to South Africa and  make  a
contribution. With their foreign capital they  bought  a  house  in  Kempton
Park. A few nights ago four robbers laid in wait for  them  and  Tienie  was
shot dead - just like that, bang, and that is the end of you! The  criminals
disappeared and will probably never be apprehended.

He went on to write:


  Vir my het die debat oor  immigrasie  emosioneel  in  die  harde  praktyk
  hiermee geëindig. Ek weet skielik, vol van woede, dat  ek  geen  begeerte
  meer het om terug te gaan en 'n  bydrae  te  lewer  nie,  behalwe  om  my
  huisraad in Suid-Afrika so gou moontlik te begin verkoop.
It is  our  responsibility,  as  leaders,  to  create  a  climate  in  which
incidents like these do not take place. This weekend  Mr  and  Mrs  Dent  of
Wartburg in KwaZulu-Natal were murdered. He was a well-known farmer  in  the
area. At about the same time a youth representative of  the  FF  attended  a
youth parliament  in  Galeshewe.  Time  and  again  the  ANC  youth  members
chanted: ``Kill the boer! Kill the farmer!'', and this disillusioned the  FF
youth member, who wanted to speak about co-operation and reconciliation,  to
such an extent that she asked for permission not to attend the rest  of  the
proceedings. We have already laid a charge in this regard.

It is the responsibility of all political leaders to educate and  discipline
their followers. If their behaviour promotes racism and hate speech,  it  is
the responsibility of all of us. The FF has  already  issued  several  media
statements in the past in which Afrikaners were criticised about racism  and
hate speech.

No funeral of a farmer has  yet  been  politicised.  However,  the  question
remains - and this is a hard question - what would be the  reaction  of  the
ANC leaders if farmers were to chant:  ``Kill  the  Xhosa!  Kill  the  black
man!'' during the funeral of the Dents which will take  place  on  Saturday?
Can we consider the implication  of  that  and  the  effect  of  it  on  all
concerned?]

I must also be fair and compliment the President for what  he  said  in  his
speech at Mr Mokaba's funeral about students who took part in  burning  down
buildings at the University of the North. That was leadership. Difficult  as
it is for all of us as leaders, we have to do things that are right but  not
always popular.

After   11   September,   some   feared   that    Africa's    insignificance
internationally  would  wipe  it  off  the  radar   screen   of   mainstream
international affairs. Thanks to President Mbeki  and  Nepad  that  has  not
happened. What is important now is that we ask not what the West can do  for
us, but what Africa can do for itself.  Future  generations  would  have  to
blame us if this initiative does not succeed. The FF supports the  President
in his effort at the G-8 summit. [Time expired.]

Mr M G  J  MZONDEKI:  Mr  Chairperson,  Comrade  President,  Comrade  Deputy
President and hon members, when the ANC made a  commitment  to  improve  the
quality of life of all  and  to  ensure  that  all  have  access  to  social
justice, it also put  in  place  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  indeed  these
obligations are met.  The  Presidency  enables  the  President,  the  Deputy
President and the Minister in the Presidency to fulfil their  constitutional
responsibilities.

I would like to talk about some of the structures that  are  established  in
the Presidency. Because the ANC is committed to ensuring  that  not  only  a
few people enjoy constitutional  rights,  but  that  all  do,  it  found  it
appropriate and very strategic to have a  special  focus  on  children,  the
youth, women and people with disabilities by establishing  such  offices  in
the Presidency. The establishment of these offices  in  the  Presidency  was
therefore a fulfilment of that commitment.

An alternative would have been to have Ministries responsible  for  each  of
these sectors. For instance, we could have had a Ministry which  dealt  with
issues of women and a Ministry which  dealt  with  children's  affairs,  but
that approach would undermine the principle of  full  integration  into  all
spheres of  South  African  society  and  the  mainstreaming  of  issues  on
children, youth, women and disabled persons.

The establishment of these offices in the Presidency ensures that  there  is
sufficient access to all government departments and ensures  their  positive
impact on all government legislation, policies and programmes.  We  want  to
thank the President for taking a lead on this commitment.

As we debate this Budget Vote today, it becomes important  to  also  examine
some of the work that is done from these  offices  so  that  we  can  decide
whether we have allocated enough resources  to  enable  them,  to  do  their
work. I will not be able to deal with all of  them,  and  I  know  that  the
Minister in the Presidency has already dealt with some of these.

The overall objective of the Office on the Rights of the Child  is  to  work
towards the improvement, protection and promotion of children's  rights  and
children's issues.

Let us look at some of the work that has been done  between  2001  and  2002
from that office. Regarding the media code  workshops,  two  workshops  were
held which were attended by  editors,  journalists  and  representatives  of
print, radio, television and electronic media. They all contributed  to  the
groundwork that brought about the code of ethics which will govern  how  the
media will report on children. Members, I think,  will  share  with  me  the
view that that is very important. Many people have not  been  able  to  come
forward to report the abuse of their children because of the  way  in  which
the media reported these issues. I think that this  is  a  very  great  step
towards achieving our goal.

There has also been the Child's Rights Awareness  Campaign  which  has  been
conducted  through  documentaries  and  radio  talk   shows.   International
Children's Day was held here, in this Parliament, last year  and  its  theme
was: Hear our voices. Children were appealing to all  of  us  to  hear  what
they had to say. There were also the children's  rights  advocacy  campaigns
which were held in all the nine provinces between  January  and  April  this
year. Close to 100 workshops were held and reached  the  target  of  10  000
children. A workshop was held in Parliament from  May  to  June  2002  where
children represented their learner representative councils in Parliament  as
part of the Child Protection Week activities. A number of  other  activities
were planned for the year.

The Office on the Status of Disabled Persons monitors the  extent  to  which
departments implement  the  Integrated  National  Disability  Strategy.  For
those members who do not know, this is the  policy  framework  which  guides
departments as to how they can integrate  issues  around  disabilities  into
their  various  departmental  programmes.  The   following   projects   were
undertaken by that office. A situational  analysis  on  the  integration  of
disability into government departments was conducted. I will not  deal  with
the report which came out of that because it is quite extensive, but  it  is
going to play a very important role. It is going to  serve  as  a  means  to
monitor the extent to which government departments implement the  Integrated
National Disability Strategy. I must say that if one just  throws  a  glance
at that report, one finds that there is still a lot of work  that  needs  to
be done by a variety of departments.

A disability public education strategy was also developed in that office.  I
happened to attend one of the workshops which  did  the  groundwork  towards
the establishment of that strategy. There  was  a  full  commitment  by  the
media to begin to focus not only on the negative aspects of disability,  but
on the positive ones as well. The OSDP is also, as the  Minister  mentioned,
involved in co-ordinating the  establishment  of  disability  desks  in  the
provinces and at local government level where a lot of delivery is going  to
take place.

I would like to tell the hon the Minister that I think it  is  important  to
ensure that there is consistency. My experience informs me that we  need  to
look at how these offices are staffed. Various provinces are not  consistent
in terms of placing these offices where they need to be located,  where  the
people who are managing these offices have enough authority to  be  able  to
engage with senior  people  in  the  departments.  That,  I  think,  is  the
problem.

As I said, I will not be able to deal with all the issues. The Minister  has
dealt with some of them. It is important to mention that the interaction  of
the structures in the Presidency  with  civil  society  is  crucial,  hence,
their programmes are informed by the voices of the ordinary  people  in  the
communities. I believe that this approach is  very  empowering  and  goes  a
long way to enabling members of our society to  heed  our  President's  call
for Vuk'uZenzele and voluntarism.

I want to conclude by recognising the  positive  contribution  made  by  our
youth during this month. They did not only  volunteer  to  help  themselves,
but volunteered to  better  the  lives  of  all  of  us,  as  the  President
mentioned this afternoon. We are  challenged  to  ensure  that  we  allocate
enough resources to enable all young people  to  participate  in  the  youth
programmes. I strongly believe  that  the  Umsobomvu  Fund  will  assist  in
implementing  some  of  the  programmes  outlined  in  the  National   Youth
Commission policy framework.

I would like to express a special word of thanks  to  Minister  Essop  Pahad
and all other Ministers who continue to support all  those  sectors  that  I
have mentioned.

The ANC supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, I also wish the  hon  the  President  good
health on his sixtieth birthday.

We all know very well that people have different expectations as far as  the
Government is concerned, but there is collective consensus as to the  nature
of delivery expected from the Government. We are talking about  delivery  to
the poorest of the poor. Their daily experiences of poverty  bear  testimony
to these expectations. They often go to bed having  had  only  one  meal  or
nothing at all. These are people who do not have  the  privilege  of  eating
three meals a day. Surely, the yardstick with which to gauge the  Office  of
the Presidency's effectiveness can rest in specific areas of focus only?

The report which was tabled by the University  of  Stellenbosch  during  the
course of 2001, to which the  President  alluded  during  his  state-of-the-
nation address earlier this year, outlined the criteria on which his  office
or term of office is being assessed. The report stated  that  the  President
made 43 promises in his speech on 8 January 2001. Eleven  months  after  his
speech was made, 65% of those promises had  either  been  achieved  or  were
credibly in progress. The report revealed that 16% of  those  promises  have
not  been  achieved.  Surely,  these  magical  figures  or  statistics   are
impressive. We are not surprised as to why the President  chose  to  include
in  his  speech  this  assessment  from  academics,   especially   from   an
institution like Stellenbosch  University.  It  is  not  only  dangerous  to
quantify achievement in this  manner,  it  is  also  misleading,  especially
since we are witnessing job losses on a daily basis, the  deeply  entrenched
poverty in our communities, an economy that is not performing  as  predicted
in Gear and the falling value of our currency.

However, we need  to  acknowledge  that  there  are  positive  signs  and  a
willingness on the part of the President to  meet  public  expectations.  As
public representatives, we are not  only  expected  to  hold  Government  to
account, but to give praise when it  is  due.  There  are  areas  where  the
President should have  done  better.  The  President  has  achieved  notable
successes. For instance, in the area  of  foreign  affairs,  he  managed  to
place Africa's agenda  as  a  priority  issue  to  be  addressed  in  global
politics.

His shining example is the Nepad initiative. What makes  it  unique  is  the
fact that the programme is home-brewed for Africans by Africans  themselves,
and it currently enjoys support. He has to be credited for  setting  up  the
commission which investigated the causes that led to the  dramatic  fall  of
our currency value. He has also realised that privatisation of state  assets
should take root in an economic environment  that  is  stable  in  order  to
minimise job losses. His flexibility in dealing  with  public  issues,  even
though at times he appears to be stifled by party politics, is commendable.
We have cited some of his successes and failures. It is hoped that  he  will
learn and improve on them. If he fails, we will all fail as South  Africans.
Hence, it is imperative for all South Africans to be  critical  and  helpful
to ensure that we achieve national objectives  in  achieving  a  better  and
prosperous society for all. It is equally  important  that  this  office  be
capacitated to pursue national interests and nothing else. [Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, Mr Deputy President and hon members,  I
would like to say to Comrade President: Happy birthday.

I plan to address three issues during this important debate. I will  present
a brief report on  the  health  month  of  April  and  how  the  country  is
responding to the call of the Vuk'uZenzele campaign. I will share  with  the
House  some  highlights  of  our  international  work,  in  particular   the
implementation of Nepad. I will extract from the National HIV  and  Syphilis
Sero-Prevalence Survey in order to show achievements made  by  young  people
in the fight against HIV/Aids.

The Department of Health celebrated  its  first  National  Health  Month  in
April. This was in response to the  President's  announcement  in  February,
that April should be observed as  a  health  month  this  year.  The  annual
observation  of  World  Health  Day  on  7  April  made  that   particularly
appropriate. The theme for this  year's  World  Health  Day  was:  Move  for
health. It emphasised the important role of individuals and  communities  in
promoting good health and taking responsibility for  health.  Health  Action
also highlighted  the  important  role  of  communities  in  mobilising  for
health, providing support to those who  are  ill,  volunteering  to  improve
health services and advocating for community development as  the  foundation
for good health. The theme was supported by  various  focus  areas  such  as
nutrition,   food   security,   HIV/Aids,   health   workers'    excellence,
volunteerism, imbizo and moving for health.

As a build-up to the health month, we observed World TB Day on 24 March  and
launched  guidelines  on  contraception  in  KwaZulu-Natal  on  26  March  -
including guidelines for  young  and  adolescent  health.  Other  activities
included the following: the launch of a food gardens initiative in all  nine
provinces in order to promote food security and nutrition, which was led  by
Ministers and Deputy Ministers; the celebration of Cecilia  Makiwane  awards
at Unisa, which was also attended by the President; observing  World  Health
Day at Sol Tsotetsi sports complex in Sebokeng, which  focused  on  physical
activity and exercise; holding imbizos in all nine  provinces;  receiving  a
donation of 104 wheelchairs from the Republic of China,  and  launching  the
national and intercountry certification committee  for  the  eradication  of
polio. The intercountry  certification  committee  is  an  initiative  which
includes Lesotho, Swaziland and South Africa.

Ministers and  Deputy  Ministers  transversed  the  whole  country  to  give
clarity to the public Government's policy on HIV/Aids. Imbizo is a style  of
interactive governance. It reinforces Government's  commitment  to  keep  in
touch with people. Through the imbizos, people form a bond  with  Government
and are afforded a platform for dialogue. Vuk'uZenzele  is  about  each  and
every person taking an  active  part  in  the  building  of  our  nation  by
volunteering time, skills and expertise. Examples of  volunteerism  projects
in April included, among others, close to 20  000  people  giving  up  their
time to clean and repair health facilities in Gauteng  alone.  In  the  Free
State, 2 000 individuals regularly volunteer to support TB patients. In  the
Northern  Cape,  60  youth  volunteers  are  involved  in  health  awareness
campaigns among young people.

South Africa chairs  the  SADC  Health  Ministers'  forum.  We  are  already
implementing the health sector protocol which was adopted  in  August  2000.
On 4 June I hosted the minister of health of Senegal who was on an  official
visit to South Africa. We signed  a  declaration  of  intent  to  share  our
health technology, including referral of patients. Senegal is  an  important
partner because it chairs Ecowas. Last month, I visited  Angola  and  I  saw
how that country is recovering from a protracted  civil  war.  I  signed  an
agreement with Angola so that we can work together on postgraduate  training
of health personnel and on the referral of  their  patients  to  our  public
facilities, including  collaboration  on  laboratory  diagnosis  of  complex
diseases, polio in particular. During this year we will focus on similar co-
operation with central and East Africa.

In January this year, SADEC health ministers  and  representatives  from  90
countries adopted the Johannesburg Declaration  on  health  and  sustainable
development. South Africa was mandated to draft and table the resolution  at
the  World  Health  Assembly.  The  World  Health  Assembly   adopted   that
resolution in May 2000. This will, we trust, receive due  attention  at  the
upcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development.

The Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and malaria  is  an  innovative  and  very
important financial instrument for funding Aids, TB and  malaria  programmes
in developing countries, and especially in Africa where the burden of  these
diseases is the greatest.

At the last  board  meeting,  South  Africa  was  awarded  approximately  R1
billion. The fund needs, of  course,  greater  representation  by  countries
that  bear  the  greatest  burden  of  these  diseases.  It  should   affirm
governments' leadership and stewardship  role,  and  all  proposals  to  the
Global Fund must  go  through  a  country's  co-ordinating  mechanism  which
comprises government, business and civil society. It should be a  grant  and
a solidarity fund, and poor countries should not be forced to take out  huge
loans in order to provide basic health care services and infrastructure.

During the World Health Assembly, African  ministers  of  health  adopted  a
statement on the Global Fund which talks about all these  things.  Following
our presentation on Nepad, the ministers adopted  a  resolution  to  hold  a
more detailed discussion on Nepad and  to  elaborate  on  the  programme  of
action during the regional committee meeting of WHO Africa,  which  will  be
held in Brazzaville in August this year.

The health sector is pleased that the the World  Economic  Forum  in  Durban
last month prioritised issues of health and HIV/Aids. In essence, the  World
Economic  Forum  expressed  its  support  for  our  health  agenda  and  our
multisectoral response to Aids.

The 2001 National HIV and Syphilis Sero-Prevalence Survey report shows  that
HIV prevalence among teenagers has been declining in the past  three  years.
It was 16,5% in 1999 and now  it  is  15,4%.  The  decline  in  teenage  HIV
infection is supported by the decline in the syphilis trends in this  group.
The syphilis trend among the teenage and antenatal  clinic  attendees  under
20 years of age has, indeed, decreased from 5,4% in 1999 to 2,3% in 2001.

The decline, both in the HIV and syphilis  infection  rates,  is  associated
with a number of interventions, such  as  health  promotion  and  education,
antenatal routine syphilis identification and treatment, and especially  the
syndromic management and treatment of sexually transmitted infections.

Particular reference to the teenage group  is  made  because  the  declining
trends in these infections is considered a  good  indicator  of  behavioural
change aimed at  reducing  health  risks,  including  HIV  infection.  These
results are a cause for celebration especially during this  month  of  June,
the youth month. Our young people are taking our health  education  campaign
seriously, and are making efforts to stop the spread  of  HIV  and  sexually
transmitted infections.

On 3 June 2002, I opened a meeting of the African  Aids  Vaccine  Programme.
The establishment of the African Aids Vaccine Programme  was  a  significant
step because, in the past, African scientists worked in isolation from  each
other. This was a conscious effort for these scientists  to  co-operate  and
collaborate with each other in the search  for  a  vaccine  against  the  HI
virus.

The President repeatedly emphasises that we do  not  live  in  a  cocoon  as
South Africans in this region of the world. We live in a global village  and
community, especially when it  comes  to  disease  prevention  and  control,
because disease knows no physical  boundaries.  Health  is  a  public  good,
hence  the  need  to  intervene  in  trade-related  matters,  such  as   the
agreements reached in Doha  on  medicines.  We  appreciate  the  President's
leadership, which ensures that we do not  focus  on  the  narrow  biomedical
model of health, but that we focus  on  and  confront  developmental  issues
that impact on health,  especially  the  determinants  of  health,  such  as
water, sanitation, the environment and poverty. [Applause.]

Dr  M  S  MOGOBA:  Chairperson,   President,   Deputy   President,   I   say
congratulations to the President on his birthday.

Šatee! Šatee! Yoo a sa rego šatee o a duma! Gola o lekane le tlou,  tšhukudu
e be mošemanyana e be mfana. [Applause.] [Happy birthday  to  you.  May  you
see many more! [Applause.]]

Since our last debate on the Vote of the Presidency, there has  been  a  lot
of visible energy and activity on the part of the  Government  to  undertake
the momentous task of bringing about delivery  by  Government  in  order  to
address the groans of the  unemployed  and  the  poor.  The  Office  of  the
President must take credit for this administrative shake-up. The  legacy  of
poverty and underdevelopment comes from  previous  governments,  but  if  we
look at what the nationalist government  did  with  the  poor-white  problem
after 1948, we know that change is possible if  there  is  enough  political
will.

Many in this House who are my age and older,  personally  experienced  poor-
whitism in  communities  like  Eersterus,  Riverside,  Storlom,  Marabastad,
David Selborne, Duncan Village, etc, to mention but a few. And, we saw poor-
whitism evaporate  before  our  very  eyes.  It  is  the  inescapable  moral
responsibility  and  duty  of  this  Government  to   tackle   poverty   and
unemployment head-on.

Poverty knows no political or  ideological  grouping  or  colour.  It  is  a
cruel, devastating reality. There  is  a  perception  in  the  country  that
people who are not ANC members are denied jobs and opportunities.  They  are
poor and, shamefully, poverty is used as a tool to inflict more  poverty  on
them to gain political subservience and subjugation.  This,  I  said,  is  a
perception. If it is true,  let  me  hasten  to  warn  that  this  will  not
succeed. In fact, it is a vicious boomerang that will  surely  land  on  the
head of the thrower.

With the time  at  my  disposal,  I  want  to  be  very  cryptic.  One  word
characterises the Government today, and that word is crisis. Firstly,  there
is the crisis of poverty, as I have explained above. Secondly, there is  the
crisis of hope. Many people, particularly young  people,  have  very  little
hope of real change. Education, which usually opens doors  of  opportunities
for the young, is hopelessly crippled. Many poor  parents  take  their  last
money and vote with their feet, voting for  schools  which  were  previously
designated white schools and which are geographically far from their  homes.
Then we still have the  unusually  high  incidence  of  crime,  despite  the
valiant attempts by the Scorpions to bite the perpetrators  of  crime.  This
beautiful country is a gift from God;  the  only  thing  that  destroys  our
beautiful country is crime, which is man-made. It is  within  our  power  to
create peace and security. Many other countries like Malaysia have done  it.
Even our neighbouring African countries do not tolerate  crime  levels  like
ours. Our levels of crime are unacceptable and should  be  ruthlessly  dealt
with.
The dark cloud of Aids is hovering over our nation. One chief told  me  last
week that even in the rural  areas,  funerals  take  place  regularly,  even
weekly. When addressing young people last week, I said  to  them:  Everybody
is praying  and  working  very  hard  to  find  a  cure  for  Aids.  Present
indications are that the cure will  be  found  soon.  For  now,  look  after
yourselves, because when the cure is found  and  you  are  already  in  your
grave, how will the cure help you? I  repeat:  Look  after  yourselves.  God
will not allow this country and the world to be destroyed''.

What struck me was the sudden light that beamed on the faces of these  young
people. I wish that all the youth of our land would  change  their  mind-set
and develop a fighting spirit radiating with hope.  This  Government  should
stop the uncalled-for denial syndrome. Aids is a  killer,  and  it  destroys
hope. We should not allow despair and fear to reign in our  country.  It  is
dark, yes, but it is only the darkest hour before dawn. The  sun  will  rise
again soon.

Thirdly, there is a crisis of unity. The word  ``unity''  has  been  on  our
lips as the PAC since 1959, 43 years ago, and on my  lips  since  1996,  six
years ago. What seems very clear is that our  dictionary  and  that  of  the
Government's does not seem to be the same. Unity does not mean cohesion, co-
option or absorption; it means co-operation and common purpose.

Yesterday's commemoration of Soweto, like the commemoration  of  Sharpeville
and the  celebration  of  the  anniversary  of  our  national  independence,
emphasises that great national events which cost this nation  the  blood  of
its children, are events that divide this nation. They are being  celebrated
in ghetto political style  and  used  to  mobilise  party  strengths.  These
events, and others like them, do not belong  to  a  single  party;  and  the
original participant in these events and the victims  that  suffered  belong
to all of us. To trivialise these events is  a  political  insult  to  these
people and a deliberate widening of the gap between parties and the nation.

Against this background, we now have  the  African  Union  and  Nepad.  Pan-
Africanists  all  over  the  world  have  been  advocating   African   unity
development for more than 50 years. It would be a tragic  thing  for  Africa
if the new version of Pan-Africanism and the new version  of  the  OAU  take
off in a partisan way in our country, in SADEC and in Africa as a whole.
The moot question is: Why is it necessary to  divide  us  on  such  a  noble
ideal? Of course, we may have some differences of approach. We  may  express
caution  of  the  dominant  role  of  G-8  countries   and   the   fear   of
recolonisation of Africa, as is already happening in countries  like  Kenya.
These  would  be  legitimate  and  constructive  concerns  that  could  only
strengthen Nepad and support for it in this country and on the continent  of
Africa. These concerns, seriously evaluated, would  enhance  and  strengthen
Nepad policy in our country and on the continent. Avoiding  open  debate  on
Nepad can only harm it. We mean well and we want to play our  role  in  this
country and in Africa.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Dr M S MOGOBA: After all, we fought together in prisons and  in  exile,  and
appeared together at the OAU and the UN on many platforms. Why should we  be
at variance now when apartheid is dead, if it is dead at all?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Order!  Hon  member,  your  time  has
expired.

Dr M S MOGOBA: We support the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr M A MAPHALALA:  Sihlalo,  ngithi  sengathi  uMongameli  angaba  nezinwele
kodwa lezi ezimpunga zingandi kakhulu. Siyabonga kunkosikazi ngokuthi  wenze
uMongameli waba nale mpilo enhle. [Chairperson, I wish the  President  would
have hair, but not gray hair. We would like to  thank  the  first  lady  for
helping the President be in such good health.]

If it was not for the wife of the President, he would not  be  where  he  is
today. I say thank you very much. [Applause.]

Comrade President and Deputy President, I thought it would be necessary  for
one in debating this Budget Vote to remind people where we  come  from  with
this particular approach. However, before doing that, I just want  to  steal
a bit of the President's  responsibility  and  address  Dr  Mogoba.  Had  he
continued his role as a  bishop  in  the  church,  he  would  probably  have
retired a very dignified person,  rather  than  making  himself  a  laughing
stock in this situation. [Interjections.] He was speaking about a crisis  of
poverty.

The ANC was established in 1912. The reason for  the  establishment  of  the
ANC, amongst other things, was the harsh  conditions  in  which  our  people
found themselves. I will quote from Drum magazine of 1953 so  that  the  hon
members can hear properly.

An HON MEMBER: Where were you?

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Hawu, ngangiphila. Phela mina ngimdala. [Uhleko.] [Hey!  I
was already born. I am old, you know. [Laughter.]]

In those days the black man - I would like to  say  to  Mr  Seremane  -  was
treated as a beast of burden. [Interjections.] He  was  knocked  and  kicked
about with impunity. [Interjections.] In the magistrate's  court  his  voice
was hardly heard and his evidence hardly believed. [Interjections.]  He  was
stopped in streets and at street corners by policemen demanding  he  produce
a pass and a receipt for tax. He was not allowed to travel in  first  class,
second class or third class carriages on the train. [Interjections.]

He was  made  to  travel  in  the  same  truck  in  which  the  cattle  were
transported, the same truck in which the horses were transported.  That  was
how things were for the  black  person  in  South  Africa.  [Interjections.]
Economically, a black person had no  voice  in  the  administration  and  in
making the laws in the political sphere.

In the economic sphere, the black person was made to live in abject  poverty
and conditions of starvation. Those were the conditions that  made  the  ANC
come into being. And that is the background to that kind of a mandate  of  a
better life for all in  South  Africa.  [Interjections.]  That  mandate  was
repeated in 1955 - I would like to say to the Comrade  President.  In  1994,
the ANC came into power. South Africans gave the ANC the mandate once  again
that the President lead us in Parliament, and that he lead  us  in  changing
the laws to enable the building of a better life in South Africa.
South Africans and the ANC gave the President  a  mandate  to  lead  us.  In
1999, the South African people wanted change to be speeded up  in  terms  of
this mandate they gave the President. [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  We  say
that there can be no better life for all unless there  is  economic  growth,
employment and equitable distribution of income. He has  said  that,  and  I
confirm it. The President is saying that we must push back the frontiers  of
poverty, and let us increase the access to that income. I say yes to that.

But the President also says that unless all of us lend a  hand  in  building
that better life, unless  all  of  us  lend  a  hand  in  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty, that shall remain a dream. The question is:  How  many
of us in this House are lending a hand in building  that  better  life;  how
many of us in this House are pushing back the frontiers of poverty?

Ngithi kuQabane uMongameli abantu baseMsinga, okuyibona i-ANC  eyangithumela
ukuthi  ngizobakhulumela  futhi  ngizobalalelela  lapha,  bathi  sebemuzwile
ukuthi uthi asifake isandla, sibambe sonke futhi sivuke sizenzele.

Kukhona indawo enkulu kakhulu eyambiwa laphaya eMsinga. Bathi bakha  ithange
lokugcina amanzi. Kunemimfula emibili eMsinga engashi ubusika nehlobo.  Leyo
mifula uThukela neMpofana. Ayishi leyo mifula. Kugcwele  iziphethu  eziningi
laphaya  futhi   ezingashi   ebusika   nasehlobo.   Kodwa   bathi   abakwazi
ukuwasebenzisa lawa manzi ukuze  kusizakale  bonke  abantu  baseMsinga  bese
bephila  kangcono.  Bamba  umsele  ngezandla  zabo  ukuze   badonse   amanzi
bawalethe  lapho.  Bathi  into  asebeshoda  ngayo   nje   ukuthi   uHulumeni
abalekelele ngezinto  abazidingayo  ukuze  bakwazi  ukuwadonsa-ke  la  manzi
aphume ayoshona laphaya. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to say to Comrade President that the  people  of  Msinga  whom
the ANC sent me to speak and listen to, say they have  heard  the  President
saying we should contribute, and all of us should take part  and  we  should
wake up and do things ourselves.

There is a big hole that was dug  there  in  Msinga.  They  said  they  were
building a tank for storing water. There are two rivers in  Msinga  that  do
not dry up in winter and summer. Those rivers are the Thukela  and  Mpofana.
Those rivers do not dry up. There are  fountains  of  water  coming  to  the
surface of the river, and they do not dry up in winter and summer. But  they
say they are unable to use this water so that the people of Msinga could  be
helped and have a better life. They dug a ditch  with  their  own  hands  so
that they could divert water  to  that  place.  They  said  what  they  were
running short of, was for Government's help with things that  they  need  so
that they would be able to move the water to that place.]
That is lending a hand for a better life for all. [Applause.]

Isikhathi sami sesiphelile kodwa ngicela  kuSihlalo  angiphe  umzuzwana  nje
kuphela. Abantu kuthiwa bayalima kodwa isivuno abasikhipha  laphaya  sishona
eThekwini emakethe nasezimakethe zaseMgungundlovu.  Bathi-ke  abantu  bacela
ukuba uHulumeni abahlangabeze.  Noma  kunjalo-ke  bayazama  ukuzakhela  bona
ngokwabo  impilo  engcono.  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation   of   Zulu   paragraph
follows.)

[My time has expired, but I would like to ask the Chairperson to give  me  a
more few minutes. They say people are ploughing, but the harvest  that  they
get, is taken to the markets in  Durban  and  Pietermaritzburg.  People  are
asking the Government to meet them somewhere. However, they  are  trying  to
make a better life for themselves on their own.] [Applause.]]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Chairperson, the budget we have to  consider  is  intended
to empower the  Office  of  the  President  of  South  Africa.  The  present
incumbent had the advantage of following  in  the  footsteps  of  the  first
democratically elected President of this country, Mr Mandela, a  leader  who
inspired the nation to such an extent that, during 1994  to  1999,  he  drew
larger public support than the political party he belonged  to.  Mr  Mandela
led those South Africans who fought in  the  struggle  to  join  hands  with
those who caused the struggle and, through the TRC process,  he  guided  and
helped both sides to reconcile their differences.  He  laid  the  foundation
for what was supposed to be the ``rainbow nation''.

During Mr Mandela's term of office, every  major  statesman  or  stateswoman
who sought to advance his or her political career made sure he  or  she  was
seen meeting Mr Mandela in South Africa. It had prestige value for  them  to
be seen in this country where peace came about through a miracle  and  where
a  new  nation  was  built  through  peace  and  goodwill  by  a  role-model
president.

During those days, our currency was stronger, our people were  more  united,
investment levels were higher and our President  was  a  resident  of  South
Africa. He led by example. Since then,  however,  our  country  has  seen  a
group of foreign leaders who seek world  recognition  through  our  nation's
standing in the eyes of the world and not the status of political leaders.
The money we vote for the Presidency should not be  wasted  to  improve  the
profiles of the Mugabes,  the  Castros  and  the  Gaddafis  of  this  world.
[Interjections.] When we bury people who created  division  in  this  nation
because of the slogans they chanted, then we  expect  our  leaders  to  bury
those slogans with them. The ANC and  its  leaders  should  not  allow  hate
speech slogans or songs to remain alive in the new South Africa.

Dit dra net die haat van die vorige  geslag  oor  aan  die  volgende.  [This
simply carries the hatred of  the  previous  generation  over  to  the  next
generation.]

If our President pushes aside women who annoy him, he must also be  seen  to
deal with men who stand in the way of reconciliation. He must prove  to  the
nation that he is willing to fight racism  with  vigour  and  aversion,  and
that he will not tolerate its existence within the ranks of the  party  that
he leads. If the President is willing to brush aside a party member for  not
conforming and acting with dignity  at  a  presidential  function,  then  he
should also stop  those  who  sing  ``Kill  the  farmer,  kill  the  boer''.
[Interjections.]

If our President, through  his  Deputy,  is  calling  on  church  and  other
leaders to start a movement for moral regeneration in our society,  then  he
should not undo the work of the TRC by releasing a  murderer  whom  the  TRC
could not link to the struggle. If our President has taken a vow  to  uphold
the Constitution, then he should not allow his party to interfere  with  the
work of Scopa and allow his  caucus  to  force  out  hon  member  Feinstein.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Let me conclude by referring to the way our President  and
his Government allowed our currency to devalue. Were  it  not  for  ordinary
businessmen like Kevin  Wakeford,  one  wonders  where  Messrs  Mboweni  and
Manuel would be. [Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms S C VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, hon President,  hon  Deputy  President,
the Presidency in its restructured form has become  the  central  core,  the
apex, of the Government's system, as recommended by the Presidential  Review
Commission. Its job is to be the overall manager of Government; it must  co-
ordinate and streamline Government programmes into a cohesive force to  face
the country's challenges and to implement the programmes of Government.

We in Parliament must assess the  Presidency's  progress  each  year  as  we
conduct our oversight work. We must assess the  coherence  of  policies  and
programmes and how they impact on the lives  of  our  citizens  -  how  many
houses have been built, how many people have running water, and so  on.  How
far has this Government gone towards overcoming our biggest  challenge:  the
reduction and, ultimately, the elimination of poverty?

The President has challenged all of us in this House and in our  communities
across the country to make our own  contribution  to  defeating  our  mutual
enemy - poverty. He has  called  on  us  to  make  this  task  our  national
priority. To face this challenge, we must all answer the call  and  we  must
do so with a unity of purpose.

To what extent can we say that we recognise that the destiny  of  all  South
Africans depends on the success of this project? The task  is  not  for  the
Government alone. The task is for leaders in business and civil society.  It
is for each person in their own way to share the leadership role.  The  task
requires of us that we first understand what  makes  us  South  African  and
what makes this task so important to all of us, not only those who  live  in
poverty, but especially to those who do not. So we  must  ask  ourselves  in
this House: How far have  we  come  in  achieving  a  common  South  African
purpose?

When I began to think  about  this  debate  this  afternoon,  I  looked  for
references to nation-building. What are the elements of nationhood and  what
are the forces that make it happen? What are the things that  bind  us,  and
the things that divide us?

I discovered that our daily discourse is punctuated at every turn with  this
discussion.  We  discuss  our  nationhood  in  the  newspapers,  in  learned
articles, in conversations on the street. We are consumed with it, in  fact.
Everyone is talking about it. Saki Macozoma wrote about it in a  Steve  Biko
lecture series. His contribution was  entitled  ``  Build  a  South  African
Dream''. Ken Owen  talks  about  it  in  his  column  in  the  Business  Day
regularly. Zubeida Jaffer wrote about it -  about  putting  something  back.
These  are  just  a  few  examples.  Everywhere  people  are  talking  about
nationhood, certainly in this House today.
In fact, it is not only now that we are consumed  with  nationhood.  It  has
been  an  enigmatic  friend  that  has  infused  our  social  and  political
discourse for generations. The history books abound  with  examples  of  our
great leaders talking about the very subject that confronts  us  today:  How
do we build a nation from one that is divided and separate?

In 1962 Chief Albert Luthuli said:


  The task is not finished. South Africa is not yet a home for all her sons
  and daughtersÿ.ÿ.ÿ. There remains before us the building of a new land, a
  home for all who are black, white, brown,  from  the  ruins  of  the  old
  narrow groups, a synthesis of the rich cultural  strains  which  we  have
  inherited.

But, despite this discourse over so many years and at so many levels of  our
society, one of the features of  our  national  consciousness,  perhaps  not
surprisingly, remains an aptitude for pessimism and self-doubt.

I found a reference to this quality of  South  Africans  being  prophets  of
their own doom in the book South Africa: Civilisations in Conflict,  written
in 1972. The final paragraph of the book reads:


  For all its mighty flaws, however, South Africa retains mighty  potential
  for proving the prophets of doom wrong. It is a magnificent land that  is
  worth the unending struggle to master it. There is a vibrancy of life and
  therefore a demand for hope, for a coming to terms with the absurdity  of
  existence. The result is a strange attractive mixture of  exuberance  and
  melancholy in the people who live in this Elysian setting,  where  beauty
  and betrayal set off each other in dazzling contrast.

What does the home that Chief Luthuli talked about look like  and  where  is
the Elysian setting? How do we all come to terms with  our  differences  and
live as one nation in ``a synthesis of the rich cultural strains?''  How  do
we fight off the melancholy?

It is in the translation of what seems  to  be  a  commonly  held  wish  for
equality and freedom, the translation into the magnificent  land  described,
that we need to focus our actions. We must, each  of  us,  do  something  to
make our struggle to achieve a better  life  for  all  a  reality.  We  must
recognise that we share our country with  each  other  and  we  cannot  move
forward without each other. So we talk about it and we write about  it.  But
the question is: What do we do about it? The exciting  truth  is  that  many
thousands of South Africans are, in fact, doing something about it.

I found a story in the Sunday Times entitled ``Vuka'' in  April  this  year.
It goes like this:


  Andrew de la Harpe had had it with the FNB, and he had had it with  South
  Africa. Disgusted with a tide of uncertainty at the bank - the fact  that
  there was ``no way a pale male  was  going  to  make  sales  and  service
  director again'' - he decided to quit  his  job  as  manager  of  a  Port
  Elizabeth branch last year and applied to Saambou.

There is a bit of an irony there. [Laughter.]


  If he could raise the cash, he planned to emigrate.


  Then his boss dumped him and 20 other managers  in  a  township  for  the
  weekend with R25 and a broomstick.  This  month  De  la  Harpe,  30,  was
  overheard almost shouting the following to friends at a bar:  ``You  know
  what? I do not care that I'll be passed over. In fact, I am going to help
  build this country


  ... but I'm telling you, I  am  in.  I'm  even  learning  Xhosa.  Anyway,
  business is suddenly good again.''

This was a defining experience for Mr De la Harpe. He was the product  of  a
programme initiated by FNB, based on the idea  that  the  new  South  Africa
does not yet exist, that it had to be built from scratch.

They call it nation-building in the banking hall. The company realised  that
it had to change its organisational ethos when it discovered that  nine  out
of 10 of its staff members were looking for  work  elsewhere.  Staff  morale
was low and there was a consequential fall in the number of new accounts  in
the targeted emerging  black  market.  Ultimately,  in  order  to  make  the
company more competitive, things had to change.

Mr De la Harpe said of the programme: I do not know how much profit we  will
make from Vuka, but I know that it saved the  bank  from  dying.  Mr  De  la
Harpe and his co-workers  learned,  through  their  experience,  that  while
everyone in the organisation had completely  different  pasts,  they  shared
almost exactly the same values. They learned to  trust  one  another.  Trust
leads to human commitment, a commitment to wanting to build  a  life  and  a
future together. Can it be that it is as simple as that?

This programme is a response of one business to the question  of  forging  a
new national identity. There are thousands of other examples, some of  which
my colleagues have shared with us in the House today.

I believe that we in Parliament, as representatives of  the  people,  should
spearhead a campaign to organise  our  resourcefulness  and  to  use  it  to
achieve our national goals. We should create a database  of  skills  in  our
communities and provinces, and match these skills with people  and  projects
where they are needed. We can  use  our  constituency  offices  and  we  can
connect with each other like a thread throughout the country. We  can  build
on an already formidable base of volunteers that are working throughout  the
country.

The exuberance of our national spirit needs emphasis  now  rather  than  the
melancholy. In the end, Mr De la Harpe of First  National  Bank  said  after
his experience: ``Maybe I will get promoted, after all, to the job of  being
South African. Perhaps that is the greatest promotion a patriot  could  wish
for.'' [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, hon  President,  hon  Deputy  President  and
Ministers, from the MF's side we would like to wish the hon the President  a
very happy birthday. May he grow every day  to  be  more  powerful.  In  our
culture, they say: If you are younger than  me,  you  are  my  child.  Khula
ngamandla mntanami. [Grow up quickly, my child.] [Laughter.]

The MF notes that the key aim of the department is  to  provide  support  to
the President, Deputy President and hon Ministers so that  they  can  fulfil
their constitutional responsibilities in our  country.  The  management  and
support service given by the department  is  remarkable,  noting  the  broad
range of the duties upon persons of this division of Government.  Monitoring
and co-ordinating Government policies at the same time is certainly not  the
easiest of tasks. In order to do these tasks  adequately,  it  needs  to  be
funded properly so as to maintain a guarantee of delivery in this respect.

The MF notes the department's close eye on gender equality, as well  as  the
right of children and disabled persons. This is not seen  as  a  display  of
favourable concerns, but rather as keeping an eye on issues that  have  been
exploited and neglected for far too many years.

The MF is glad to note this display of concern made by the  department  over
these  matters.  The  five  programmes   of   the   department,   that   is,
administration, support service to the President and Deputy  President,  the
Cabinet office, policy, co-ordination and the national Youth Commission  are
supported by the  MF.  It  is  felt  that  the  budget  suggested  for  this
department is in order, and the  MF  takes  this  opportunity  to  wish  the
Presidency the very best for the forthcoming year with the  many  challenges
it has to face. The hon the President is doing extremely well regarding  the
transformation of  our  country  from  what  it  was.  Qhubeka  uzophela  lo
mzabalazo. [The fight must continue to the end.] [Applause.]

Mr B NAIR: Madam Speaker, I thought Mr Aucamp was before me.

The SPEAKER: Not on my speaker's list.

Mr B NAIR: Madam Speaker, hon President, Deputy President,  members  of  the
Cabinet and hon members, the members of the opposition  have  been  critical
of the President's absence in Parliament, about him not spending  more  time
answering questions,  neglecting  the  problems  at  home  and  paying  more
attention to Africa and international issues.

I challenge the mistaken, if not false, notion that the  President  and  the
Presidency as a whole is an exclusive club looking inward and  attending  to
our own affairs as in the good old days  of  South  Africa's  isolation  and
pariah status. Some may want the President to wag his finger, as P  W  Botha
did,  and  say:  ``To  hell  with  Africa  and  the  rest  of  the  world.''
[Interjections.]

It must be remembered that we are part of the world community and, as  such,
establish  cordial  relations  with  the  entire  globe.  Our  thanks   are,
therefore, due  to  the  President,  Deputy  President  and  their  team  of
Ministers. We are respected by everyone everywhere and, on crucial  matters,
our views are taken seriously.

The former President, Nelson Mandela, is playing no mean role to  this  end.
Recently, the President challenged the developed world to come  to  the  aid
of  the  poor,  underdeveloped  and  struggling  countries.  It  is   indeed
recognised that the problems  of  the  poor  countries  are  exacerbated  by
incessant wars, corruption, disease and abject poverty.

Do we simply close our eyes and ignore what is going on?  No.  We  shun  the
world at our peril. For instance,  we  cannot  ignore  global  warming,  the
horrors of wars, the ravages perpetrated by the  Sharon  government  against
the  Palestinians  or  the  conflict  in  the  Congo,  Rwanda,  Burundi   or
elsewhere. To this end, the Presidency, comprising six Cabinet committees  -
social,  economic,  investment  and  employment,  international   relations,
justice, crime prevention and security, governance and administration -  has
jointly handled the affairs at home and abroad.

The opposition is aware that questions  normally  meant  for  the  President
were dealt with superbly by the Deputy President,  so  have  all  the  other
Ministers who dealt with questions posed by members, week in and week out.

Without in any way detracting from the separation of powers, the  Presidency
envelopes  the  entire  nation,  carrying   out   policies   determined   by
Parliament. For instance, the President,  Deputy  President,  and  Ministers
Trevor Manuel and Alec Erwin have done battles with  the  IMF,  World  Bank,
the World Trade Organisation, the G-8 countries and the developed  world  to
move them from policies of protectionism, tariff wars and absolute greed  to
one of opening their vaults which have treasures looted  from  colonial  and
imperialist exploits. After all, who benefited from  the  wars  that  Shombe
and Mobutu waged against the Congolese? Where did the diamonds that  Savimbi
stole from Angola land?

Our foreign Ministry, together  with  the  Presidency,  has  provided  human
service to help weld greater unity in countries formerly at  war.  Recently,
Minister Ronnie Kasrils and his team won  accolades  and  medals  for  their
water project in Nigeria. The SA National Defence Force recently also  moved
to help Mozambique,  KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga  and  Polokwane  during  the
flood disasters. The rescue by members of the SA National Defence  Force  of
a mother and her baby born in a tree in Mozambique won worldwide acclaim.

Our outward-looking policy will hopefully rub off on the rest of the  world,
especially on the xenophobic developed world. We must  move  strenuously  to
firmly establish the African Union and  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development. It is time for Africa to  become  economically  self-sufficient
and independent. We require the help of the developed and rich, but we  must
pick ourselves up by our bootstraps and move  our  country  and  the  entire
continent to wage war against poverty through development.

This means that we develop agriculture, mining and other sectors,  not  only
for export, but to expand our industrial  base  through  beneficiation.  Why
not produce our own  jewellery  instead  of  only  exporting  our  gold  and
diamonds? Similarly, we can turn our  metal  and  aluminium  into  pots  and
pans, fridges and stoves, motor cars and planes, and  even  satellites.  Why
not? No, this is not a pipedream - one can  look  at  Denel,  Eskom  selling
electricity  to  Africa,  Telkom  and  our  cellular  networks   which   are
connecting  and  uniting  Africa,  not  to  talk  of  the  supermarkets  and
retailers, banks and financial institutions which are expanding into  Africa
and the Middle East.

Small-scale farming and agricultural co-operatives run on the lines  of  the
kibbutzim must be  encouraged  throughout  the  country.  Small  and  medium
enterprises, as envisaged by the Department of Trade and Industry,  are  the
answer to the empowerment of the millions of unemployed.

Let us take a leaf from the small handicraft, beadwork,  knitting,  weaving,
sculpturing and spaza shops. Small-scale agriculture is already  developing.
With a little training in business skills and organisation, the people  will
produce and market their products. They can also help  establish  their  own
peoples' banks to finance their future projects  and  help  others.  Greater
resources need to be allocated to  the  small  businessman  and  the  farmer
until  they  become  self-sufficient.  This  is  the   answer   to   poverty
eradication with the people  themselves  becoming  self-reliant  and  taking
control of their own lives.

It may be inferred that what I am suggesting is socialism through  the  back
door. No, what I am proffering is a way out of the poverty trap through  the
front door. [Applause.]
Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, hon President  Mbeki,  on  behalf  of  the  AEB,
myself and my wife personally, we congratulate the hon the  President  Mbeki
on his 60th birthday. It is indeed a milestone in any person's life.

On Friday afternoon, a journalist of an English Sunday paper phoned me  and,
amongst other things, asked the question: What would you  like  to  give  to
the President as a birthday present? My immediate response was:  ``A  return
flight ticket to South Africa''. [Laughter.]

I would like to call my little speech today: a Presidency  on  the  edge,  a
Presidency of conflicting impressions, a Presidency of which many people  of
my constituency often ask me: Where exactly do we stand  with  Thabo  Mbeki?
The question then arises: Is it a matter of  insufficient  communication  in
PR or is it a matter of trying to get the best of  two  worlds,  but,  alas,
two conflicting worlds?

On the one hand, there is outspoken dedication to real democracy  and  self-
government in Africa, which is a prerequisite for Nepad to succeed.  On  the
other hand, there  is  an  impression  that  only  the  historical  national
liberation movements can be agents for this. Only they have the  moral  high
ground and should stay  in  power  forever,  even  if  it  is  by  means  of
victimisation and manipulated elections like in  Zimbabwe.  After  all,  the
end justifies the means.

There is the discrepancy that the ANC, on the one hand,  has  discarded  the
economics of its socialist apprenticeship but, on the other  hand,  retained
the politics  thereof  -  in  economics,  a  free  marketeer;  in  politics,
centralism and social engineering. On the one  hand  they  uphold  the  good
principles of a real African Renaissance and the principles  of  charterism,
``South Africa belongs to all who live in it''; on the other hand there  are
echoes of plain Africanism, a renaissance of the  principles  as  formulated
by Anton Lembede in 1946, claiming Africa for black  Africans,  while  those
who have descended from Europe, the latecomers, should either  be  tolerated
or used.

On the one hand we have a vote for the suspension of  Zimbabwe's  membership
of the Commonwealth; on the very  same  day,  we  have  the  recognition  of
Mugabe's manipulated elections as legitimate. On the one  hand  there  is  a
call for reconciliation, on the other a dead silence, when even in the  year
2002 the refrain  ``Kill  the  Boer,  kill  the  farmer''  is  sung  in  the
President's very presence, on the same weekend that a husband and wife  were
brutally  murdered,  and  four  attempts  of  farm  murders  took  place  in
Mpumalanga alone.

On the one hand there is a reaching out for real  partnership,  but  on  the
other hand there is the result of co-optation as long as one stays  in  line
with ANC policy. There are talks and discussions with  role-players  in  the
Afrikaner community, but only with carefully selected, easy,  toeng-the-line
partners. On the one hand the emphasis is on the importance of the order  of
civil society, as stated again today in the President's speech, but  on  the
other hand  there  is  growing  disempowerment  of  NGOs,  school  governing
bodies, local institutions and traditional leaders.

On the one hand we have the national motto ``Unity in Diversity'',  and  the
emphasis on community rights, on  the  other  hand  the  marginalisation  of
Afrikaans  and  other  indigenous  languages  in  the  Public  Service,  the
tertiary landscape, and the  so-called  higher  functions  of  language,  in
favour of an English lingua franca. The AEB calls on the hon  the  President
to steer his Presidency, his party and the Government away  from  the  edge,
away from this conflicting image, to a clear and sound position in the  safe
and prosperous waters of  real  democracy,  real  reconciliation,  and  real
recognition of the diversity of this country.

Ek wil  graag  reageer  op  die  beroep  wat  die  agb  Gert  Oosthuizen  op
Afrikaners gedoen het. Sien, hy het kwaad gedoen en toe het hy padgegee.  Hy
is nie hier nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hy steek  in  sy  beoordeling  van  ander
Afrikaners nog vas in die verlede. Hy praat smalend van opgeskeep  wees  met
die sooibrand van die verlede. Daar  is  welmenende  patriotiese  Afrikaners
wat werk aan  daardie  sooibrand,  maar  hy  het  sommer  die  hele  pasiënt
weggegooi. Of hy wil hom sommer opneem in die dodehuis.  Hy  reken  dat  die
enigste manier waarop Afrikaners hul bydrae  aan  hierdie  land  kan  lewer,
alleen maar is om by die ANC aan te sluit of ten minste by hulle in die  bed
te spring.

Ontmoet dan vandag 'n nuwe geslag Afrikaner wat hy nie  ken  nie,  omdat  hy
die spot dryf met behulp van skimme uit die verlede. Dit is  Afrikaners  wat
sê: Ons wil nie in die wedstryd van Suid-Afrika  apaties  by  die  huis  bly
nie. Ons wil nie op die pawiljoen sit en skree nie. Ons wil ook nie  tienuur
die oggend ons eie wedstrydjie iewers op  die  C-veld  speel  nie.  Ons  wil
vieruur die middag op die hoofveld deelneem aan die  hoofwedstryd.  Ons  wil
dit egter doen in ons eie kleure, met die beskerming en handhawing  van  wat
vir ons kosbaar is, en op 'n wyse waarmee ons vertroud is. Ons wil  dit  nie
doen in isolasie nie, ook nie in koöptasie nie,  maar  in  vrye  assosiasie.
Ons wil dit doen in toewyding aan hierdie land, maar met  die  erkenning  en
die handhawing van ook ons kosbare erfenis,  ons  uniekheid,  ons  besondere
manier van deel van  Afrika  wees  -  ons  bydrae  tot  hierdie  mooi  land.
Daarvoor  sal  die  AEB  hom  steeds  bewywer.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to respond to the appeal made by the hon  Gert  Oosthuizen  to
Afrikaners. See,  he  has  erred  and  he  took  off.  He  is  not  present.
[Interjections.] He is bogged down in the past where his judgment  of  other
Afrikaners is concerned. He speaks scornfully  of  being  saddled  with  the
heartburn of the past. There are patriotic Afrikaners with  good  intentions
who have set about doing something about this heartburn,  but  he  wants  to
dispose of the entire patient. Or he wants to, without  further  ado,  admit
him to the morgue. He reckons that the only way  that  Afrikaners  can  make
their contributions to this country is solely if they join  the  ANC  or  at
least jump into bed with them.

Today then, meet the new breed of Afrikaner whom he does  not  know  because
he ridicules them with the aid of ghosts from the  past.  It  is  Afrikaners
who say: We do not, when it comes to the match  of  South  Africa,  want  to
stay at home in apathy. We do not want to sit on the  stand  and  cheer.  We
also do not want to play our own little match at ten o'clock in the  morning
somewhere on the C-field. We want to participate in the main  match  on  the
main field at four o'clock in the afternoon. We want, however,  to  do  this
in our own colours with the protection and preservation  of  that  which  is
precious to us, as well as in a manner which we are acquainted with.  We  do
not want to do this in isolation or co-option, but in free  association.  We
want  to  do  it  out  of  dedication  to  our   country,   but   with   the
acknowledgement  and  the  preservation  of  our  precious   heritage,   our
uniqueness, our particular way of being part of Africa  -  our  contribution
to this beautiful country. The AEB will continue to strive for this.]

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, Comrade President, Comrade  Deputy  President,
Minister in The Presidency Comrade  Essop  Pahad,  in  the  course  of  this
afternoon's debate we have heard one version  of  what  The  Presidency  has
conjured up, a fictitious version. The Presidency is supposedly on  the  one
hand away from Parliament, away from the country, needing  a  return  ticket
back to South Africa, and yet at the same time it is also supposed to  be  a
Presidency that tries to get its hands on every lever  in  the  country.  It
sounds like a contradiction and, of course, it is a contradiction.

In fact, it is a contradiction of a particular conservative-liberal  version
of the State, and of presidencies. The truth is that they want a  state  and
a presidency that is simultaneously far away  and  up  close  and  menacing.
They want it to be far  away  when  it  comes  to  historically  accumulated
wealth, power and privilege. When it comes to things such as mineral  rights
and the internet domain name, to take recent examples, then  it  is  laissez
faire, hands off. But they want The Presidency to be present when  it  comes
to disciplining the poor and the marginalised, and because  we  are  dealing
with a neocolonial version of liberalism, they want it  to  be  hyperpresent
when it  comes  to  dealing  with  black  heads  of  state  in  neighbouring
countries. This is why Nepad is  reduced  by  these  elements  to  a  single
obsession, the peer review mechanism, as if that was  all  that  was  Nepad.
``Where is the big stick?'' they want to know. ``How do they get  one  black
president to discipline another black president?'' No laissez faire when  it
comes to the natives.

But enough of this neocolonial liberalism. In voting for this  budget,  what
is it that the ANC expects from The Presidency? We are in  the  midst  of  a
massive national democratic transformation. The  state  and  The  Presidency
cannot and should not aspire to control or to do everything, obviously.  But
they have a crucial, active developmental role. We expect the state and  The
Presidency to be catalysts of transformation. We expect  The  Presidency  to
provide co-ordination, especially  within  and  across  Government,  and  to
provide  a  broad  strategic  coherence  to  a  complex  process   that   is
revolutionising our whole society.

In the first  years  after  the  1994  democratic  breakthrough,  the  three
cohesive strategic themes were, firstly, affirming  some  kind  of  national
identity, a rainbow nation we sometimes said, with reconciliation  being  an
important component; secondly, normalising our relations with  the  rest  of
the world; and thirdly, ensuring that Government would begin to  deliver  on
its basic promises. These remain important challenges,  important  strategic
themes. However, over the past few years, and particularly  under  this  new
Presidency, we have  tried  to  deepen  and  problematise  these  particular
themes.

Yes, we want to build a unified South African nation, but there is no  short
cut. The  gaping  chasms  of  poverty  and  inequality  -  and  they  remain
overwhelmingly  racialised  -  if  left  untransformed,  will  preclude  any
substantive and sustainable  nation-building,  let  alone  any  sense  of  a
shared national identity. Yes, we want to normalise our relations  with  the
world, but the world itself is not normal.  In  the  post-Cold  War  decade,
Africa, generally speaking, has become more  marginalised,  not  because  we
are not integrated into the world, but because the terms of our  integration
are completely unjust, which is why we must resist  the  attempt  to  reduce
Nepad, as some do, simply to a trade-off: ``We in Africa promise to be  good
in exchange for getting some of their investment from the North.''

There is certainly  poor  governance,  yes  indeed,  in  many  countries  in
Africa, including the south of Africa. But what about global  misgovernance?
What about unilateralism, the failure  to  ratify  basic  human  rights  and
environmental treaties, trade regulations and practices that are  absolutely
unjust, enforced liberalisation of the South, protectionism  in  the  North?
Africa's recovery requires that we address  both  misgovernance  within  our
midst, within our continent, and global misgovernance.  And  Africa  is  not
primarily responsible for global misgovernance.

Yes, the new democratic Government must deliver, but  Government  cannot  do
everything. We need the  co-operation  and  helping  hands  of  all.  So,  I
believe, overcoming poverty, Nepad and  African  renewal,  and  nurturing  a
spirit of volunteerism, Vuk'uZenzele, these have now become,  and  correctly
so, the core strategic themes around which  this  Presidency  has  tried  to
foster a sense of coherence.

As MPs  we  have  diverse  tasks:  to  pass  legislation,  to  work  in  our
constituencies, and to ensure that these coherent themes begin to  translate
in practice on the ground  in  our  constituencies.  But  we  also  have  an
important role in exercising oversight over Government, and that  is  not  a
role that belongs exclusively to, or is monopolised by, the  opposition.  Is
Government sufficiently focused on these core strategic challenges?  As  MPs
and certainly as ANC MPs, we can  help  to  foster  this  coherence  in  the
questions  that  we  pose,  and  in  the  expectations  that  we  place   on
departments and parastatals.

If I had more time, I would speak extensively about  the  transport  sector,
and how it is beginning to play an interesting role in  overcoming  poverty,
in lending a helping hand, and in African renewal.  The  hon  the  President
left out, by the way, the Transnet family, in  talking  about  the  role  of
parastatals. Portnet, for  instance,  is  involved  in  port  infrastructure
development right up the West and East coasts of our continent. Our  agency,
Air Traffic  and  Navigational  Services,  ATNS,  is  training  air  traffic
controllers from all over the continent.

What I want to deal with is one example, which is a little bit off the  main
stream when it comes to transport, but very important.  At  the  moment  the
Portfolio Committee on Transport is dealing  with  legislation  on  maritime
and aeronautical search and rescue. We have been engaging, of  course,  with
our department and the relevant state agencies. We thought we  should  also,
while  dealing  with  this  legislation,  invite  the  National  Sea  Rescue
Institute. This is the year of the volunteer, as we have  said.  We  thought
we should invite them to come and  tell  us  what  they  thought  about  the
legislation, the draft Bill that we have. The National Sea Rescue  Institute
is a non-governmental entity. It is entirely  voluntary,  and  it  has  been
going for some 40 years. There are now NSRI stations around  the  coastline,
from Saldanha right up to Sodwana. Something  like  650  volunteers  operate
around the clock as a stand-by service.

After we had discussed the detail of the Bill with the NSRI,  they  told  us
in passing, but with a measure of pride,  that  they  had  been  interacting
with counterparts in Uganda. There have been some terrible tragedies on  the
lake in  Uganda.  Like  South  Africa,  Uganda  cannot  afford  a  full-time
professional coast guard service. Ugandans, inspired  by  the  work  of  the
NSRI, had asked it to come and help them  set  up  a  National  Lake  Rescue
Institute. In  telling  us  about  Uganda,  the  NSRI  alluded  to  all  the
organising strategic themes that  we  have  been  mentioning:  poverty,  the
inequality of development, lending  a  helping  hand,  and  working  for  an
African recovery.

I think the NSRI finds that these  strategic  themes  are  empowering.  They
provide a map, a sense of coherence and belonging for their own  endeavours.
I am convinced that the great majority of South  Africans  are  gatvol  with
gatvol. [Interjections.] We want to  lend  our  passions,  our  skills,  our
concerns and our energies to a broad and  unifying  project.  The  ANC,  and
specifically the ANC Transport Study Group in the NA,  supports  the  budget
for The Presidency. [Applause.]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker, hon  President,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
Leader of the Opposition, it is the patriotic  duty  of  the  leadership  of
this country not to hide the truth and the realities that confront  us,  but
to expose and deal with every situation that affects our people  negatively.
Very little economic  transformation,  but  rather  crisis  management,  has
taken place over the past eight years.

Die publiek se indruk van die amp van president is dat dit strompel van  die
een krisis na die ander krisis. Dit  is  nie  wat  ek  sê  nie.  Dit  is  'n
aanhaling uit die toespraak van die agb Marthinus van Schalkwyk op 21  Junie
2001. Nou het  hy  egter  besluit  om  saam  te  strompel.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The public's impression of the office  of  the  President  is  that  it  is
limping from one crisis to another. It is not  I  who  say  so.  This  is  a
quotation from the speech of the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk made on the  21
June 2001. He has now, however, decided to limp along with them.]

Mr Van Schalkwyk also said that he understood the President to say that  the
ANC alliance was temporary, with  a  limited  lifespan.  He  said  that  the
President had lost the trust of the left wing in  his  alliance  because  of
his economic repositioning. Could this be the reason why the New  NP  leader
joined the ANC to lend a hand, and to make a difference?

Het die agb Gert  Oosthuizen  van  sy  witbeheptheid  met  die  Nuwe  NP  'n
strategie gemaak? [Has the hon Gert Oosthuizen made a strategy with the  New
NP of his obsession with white?]

I would like to tell the President that this House and the public out  there
need some explanation of his strange alliance with the New NP. How  can  the
blood of the New NP apartheid government and  that  of  the  ANC  Government
flow in the same artery? Let me rather focus the  President's  attention  on
what is happening in Cape  Town  right  now.  The  Argus  of  13  June  2002
reported: ``ANC left city books in a mess - Auditor-General  lifts  the  lid
on the missing millions in Cape Town''.  Is  the  President  aware  of  what
happened in Cape Town under the ANC Government, and did he  investigate  the
chaos?

A report by the Auditor-General has exposed the financial shambles  left  by
the ANC almost two years ago, when it lost the city  of  Cape  Town  to  the
Democratic Alliance. This report  paints  a  picture  of  mismanagement  and
bookkeeping errors, which means millions of rands  are  not  accounted  for,
let alone the billions of rands mismanaged and  not  accounted  for  in  the
rest of this country.

Indien die Nuwe NP-ANC-koalisie die Kaapstad Munisipaliteit sou oorneem,  is
dit nie die stad se boeke nie, maar die belastingbetalers  se  geld  wat  in
die slag gaan bly. Die Nuwe NP-ANC-regering wil 'n uitvoerende  burgemeester
in plaas van 'n uitvoerende komitee aanstel. Hulle wil subrade  van  16  tot
20 vermeerder, wat beteken  dat  daar  'n  addisionele  begroting  van  R3,5
miljoen gevind moet word om meer voorsitters, areakoördineerders,  personeel
en kantoorakkommodasie te betaal.
Die Nuwe NP-ANC-koalisie gaan belastingbetalers se geld gebruik om poste  te
skep om DA-raadslede om te koop. Raadslid  Mowzer  van  die  ANC  het  reeds
verwys na die moontlike afdanking van senior amptenare wat  op  kontrakbasis
aangestel is. Sulke afdankings sal verreikende  finansiële  implikasies  vir
die raad en vir belastingbetalers  inhou.  Ons  praat  van  R35  miljoen  se
afdankingspakkette en  die  aanstelling  van  comrades.  Verdere  en  groter
armoede  is  in  die  vooruitsig  vir   Kaapstad   met   so   'n   regering.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[If the New NP-ANC coalition should  take  over  the  Municipality  of  Cape
Town, it will not be the books of the city that will suffer, but  the  money
of the taxpayers that would be lost.  The  New  NP-ANC  coalition  wants  to
appoint an executive mayor instead of an executive committee. They  want  to
increase the sub-councils from 16 to 20, which implies  that  an  additional
budget of R35 million must be found to pay for the additional  chairpersons,
area co-ordinators, staff and office accommodation.

The New NP-ANC coalition will therefore utilise the money of  the  taxpayers
for the creation of posts in  order  to  bribe  DA  councillors.  Councillor
Mowzer of the ANC has already pointed out the possible dismissal  of  senior
officials who were appointed on a contractual basis.  Such  dismissals  will
have far-reaching financial implications for the council and  the  taxpayer.
We are speaking of R35 million in dismissal packages and the appointment  of
comrades. Further and greater poverty is in sight for Cape Town with such  a
government. [Interjections.]]

With respect, this Government must be big  enough  to  admit  its  mistakes,
smart enough to profit from them and strong  enough  to  correct  them.  The
single most important factor in determining the climate of a  government  is
its top executive. Everything rises and falls on leadership.

If the New NP-ANC Government does not know the harbour it  seeks,  then  any
wind will be the  right  wind  for  them;  just  like  the  three  different
speeches of  2000-01  and  today  of  the  leader  of  the  National  Party.
[Interjections.]  No  vision;  every  year  a  different  direction.   [Time
expired.][Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Madam Speaker, I dedicate this  speech  to  the  undying
spirit of Comrade Peter Mokaba and the many young lives that  were  lost  on
June 16 in the fight to free our country.

The statement delivered by the President at  the  90th  anniversary  of  the
formation of the ANC says:


  Cognisant of the fact that we are but an inseparable part  of  the  wider
  world, the Freedom Charter says: there shall be peace and friendship.


In this regard, the first call on us is to contribute everything we  can  to
ensure the success of the African Renaissance. We  have  to  work  with  our
African brothers and sisters to ensure that ours is  a  continent  of  peace
and friendship between and  among  all  its  peoples,  of  democracy,  human
rights, social progress and prosperity.

The January 8 statement goes on to urge us  to  work  towards  strengthening
our relations with both developing and developed  countries  of  the  world.
The ANC has always believed in tirelessly engaging fellow humans  on  common
positions, as well as on matters on which there might be disagreement.

The statement continues:


  From its birth, the ANC has been internationalist in character. This is a
  tradition we must sustain and deepen. This is  an  urgent  and  necessary
  response to the rapid integration of human society under  the  impact  of
  the process of globalisation. As a movement, we must advance and  respond
  to the call - peoples of the  world  unite,  for  peace,  prosperity  and
  friendship.

When the bodies of global governance were formed in the first  half  of  the
20th  century,  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  and  the   Universal
Declaration of Human Rights echoed the human values of peace, human  dignity
and mutual respect among all states and citizens of the world.

It has not come as a surprise that the ANC-led South African Government  has
been  called  upon  to  take  a  place  and  to  often  play  roles   hardly
commensurate with our reality of being the ``new  kids  on  the  block''  of
free countries. The world recognises that our commitment to peace,  freedom,
self-determination and the quest for prosperity is unshakeable.

It is in keeping  with  these  values,  based  on  the  conviction  that  as
humanity we dare not fail in the struggle for a better life for the  poorest
and most vulnerable in Africa and  the  Third  World,  that  the  Presidency
plays a leadership role internationally.

The challenge  is  to  create  the  necessary  global  political  will.  The
numerous  resolutions,  agreements,   treaties   and   other   international
instruments must be translated into actions on the ground to change  squalid
conditions of life for the masses who look up to their  leaders  to  improve
their lives. There is a challenge to restructure and change the  culture  of
international  bodies  of  governance  to  function  in  a  manner  that  is
responsive to the  needs  of  ordinary  people.  Our  Presidency  needs  the
support of Parliament through this Budget Vote to continue  in  its  efforts
internationally.

In addition to the many ongoing tasks of transformation listed in the  state
of the nation address, the Presidency also participates in heads  of  states
summit meetings of the OAU, in  Nepad,  SADC  and  the  African  Development
Forum. Finding solutions to problems in the DRC,  the  Comoros,  the  Middle
East,  East  Timor,  Lesotho,  Rwanda  and  Burundi  are  but  some  of  the
international tasks our Presidency has  been  involved  in.  South  Africa's
chairpersonship of the Nonaligned Movement  comes  to  an  end  in  February
2003. It, however,  continues  to  be  part  of  the  leadership  collective
together with the next chair.

Addressing  the  Nonaligned  Movement  ministerial  meeting  at   the   40th
anniversary of the organisation in April 2002,  the  President  reminded  us
that our people were represented in Bandung at  the  Asia-Africa  Conference
of 1955 by two members of the liberation movements. The  President  went  on
to say that, ``As Africans, we are proud of the advances we  are  making  to
give practical expression to the principles of the  Nonaligned  Movement  of
self-determination, self-reliance and solidarity. This has resulted  in  the
evolution towards  the  formation  of  the  African  Union,  which  will  be
launched in July, and the formulation of the new  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development, Nepad.

As all members know, from July this year South Africa will chair  the  OAU's
last meeting and the new African Union. Apart from it being  an  honour  for
our country, this chair goes with a lot of  responsibility,  especially  for
The Presidency and, indeed, for the Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs.  When  he
spoke to a joint sitting of the  AU  and  Nepad  on  31  October  2001,  the
President also challenged this Parliament to continue to contribute  towards
giving more content, form and direction  to  these  continental  bodies  and
programmes.

Through a working group on  the  African  Union  formed  by  this  House  in
November 2001, some work continues to be done. Four reports have since  been
tabled. Issues are being raised and  debates  continue.  Research  has  been
commissioned to take some of them further to give us a better  understanding
and expose us  to  other  human  experiences.  We  are  in  the  process  of
ratifying  the  protocol  on  the  Pan-African   Parliament   as   our   own
contribution to speeding up its convening, preferably while South Africa  is
in the chair.

We  are  aware  that  South  Africa's  chairpersonship  gives  us  a  unique
opportunity to make important inputs that will go  a  long  way  in  shaping
continental  affairs.  In  this  regard,  the  fundamental   principles   we
ourselves  enshrined  in  our  Constitution  are  important.  The   peaceful
resolution of disputes, good governance on the  basis  of  transparency  and
democratic practice, and public participation in the  management  of  public
affairs are just a few of these principles. If we all work together,  if  we
mobilise our communities and translate these continental  developments  into
sound success stories for people on the ground, nothing will defeat us.

The increase of this budget related to the  restructuring  and  addition  of
personnel to The Presidency must be supported. In order for this  office  to
do all the things it needs to do and oversee the implementation of  policies
nationally and internationally, it definitely needs more  capacity  than  it
has had. In fact, it is not clear to me  why,  in  this  context,  Nepad  is
attached  to  the  subprogrammes  of  Policy  Co-ordination.  I  would  have
expected Nepad to be a stand-alone programme,  given  its  own  volume,  but
perhaps there is a good explanation for this.

It is also unclear how The Presidency is being capacitated for  being  chair
of the AU, which is an immense responsibility needing both human  and  other
types of resources. Having listened to the cry of the  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs about inadequate resources - I draw the attention  of  the  Minister
of Finance here - I would not believe that the AU  should  be  put  at  that
door only. So where is it going to be for the purposes of  processing  South
Africa's  positions  and  boosting  our  ability  to  give   the   necessary
leadership?

At the dawn of the new millennium in September 2000, the  world's  heads  of
state and governments met and made commitments  to  peace,  development  and
the  eradication  of  poverty.  They  committed  themselves  to   an   open,
equitable,  rules-based,  predictable  and  nondiscriminatory   multilateral
trading and financial system.

As this  Parliament  supports  this  Vote,  it  gives  the  mandate  to  The
Presidency to go on leading and co-ordinating efforts, which  the  President
said when he addressed Nam, were  for  the  emergence  of  a  common  global
political will to confront the challenges of development in  the  spirit  of
true partnership between the rich and the poor.

The SPEAKER: Hon Deputy Speaker, your  time  has  expired.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: May The Presidency have all its needs,  the  good  luck,
the personnel and the budget  needed  to  achieve  all  the  programmes  ...
[Interjections.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Dr O S B BALOYI: Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,  hon  members,  I  believe
sincerely that the president of any country is the most  valuable  asset  of
the country. The Presidency needs to be the centre  point  where  confidence
of the country can be visible, and  where  the  internal,  as  well  as  the
external environment can be inspired by actions, words and  deeds  that  are
beyond reproach of that component of government.

I  accept  that  the  President  cannot  do  everything  himself,  but  that
committed, trustworthy and dedicated patriots  can  advise  and  assist  the
President to lead the country in its quest  to  become  an  important  role-
player within the region, on the continent and internationally.

South Africa has a very rich human resource pool to enrich  The  Presidency,
if only the majority party could accept that good ideas and  strategies  are
not only vested in the members of that party. The IFP has  remained  in  the
coalition Government, particularly because of our clear  understanding  that
we are able to contribute positively to governing South Africa.

We are concerned, however, about  the  manner  in  which  the  IFP  and  its
leader, Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, have been treated. Allow me to  touch  upon
one or two areas I believe The Presidency needs to review  and  refine.  The
Office of the President should  reflect  the  degrees  of  maturity  of  our
democracy. The Presidency must prove its commitment to the country  and  the
electorate by keeping the promises made at any  time  in  the  past.  Broken
promises create uncertainty, both locally and abroad.

Let me remind the House about some of the unkept promises  between  the  IFP
and the ANC, some dating as far back as the 1994  elections.  What  happened
to international mediation? What has come of  it?  What  happened  to  local
government agreements that were reached on 20 October 2000  and  which  were
not kept by Government? The list goes on.

It concerns us in the IFP that this Government has chosen to  ignore  issues
with the understanding that they will disappear. However, the issues I  have
mentioned here will not disappear and they will come back to  haunt  us  all
when our democracy falters, because we failed to  address  the  fundamentals
of our unique South African environment.

The President's Office houses very vital programmes. To mention just  a  few
- the Joint Monitoring Committee on  Improvement  of  Quality  of  Life  and
Status of Women, and the Joint Monitoring Committee on Children,  Youth  and
Persons  with  Disabilities.  The  programme   on   HIV/Aids   and   poverty
alleviation programmes are  also  spearheaded  from  this  office.  Although
reasonably good strategies have been emanating  from  these  structures,  it
has not been easy to implement them. Much work still needs to be done.

I can only endorse the concern the IFP has regarding the slow progress  that
has taken place around the issue of HIV/Aids.

Another area that requires urgent attention by the President  is  the  issue
of the slow progress by Government in resolving the powers and functions  of
traditional authorities. Huge budgets assigned  to  address  the  challenges
of, for example, the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development  Programme  in
the developmental node areas cannot be rolled out and used  smoothly,  owing
to the lack of clarity of roles between  local  government  and  traditional
authorities. The poor people living in these areas are suffering  immensely.
We refuse, as a party, to accept that traditional  leaders  are  responsible
for the failures to make progress in this area.

We feel further that,  in  the  spirit  of  Nepad  and  the  African  Union,
traditional authorities must now take centre stage on all  matters  relating
to the  culture  of  ubuntu.  Eurocentric  approaches  and  strategies  must
certainly inform our progress, but should not be the  foundation  stone  for
the initiatives envisaged  in  the  Nepad  strategy.  Traditional  authority
should be part of that foundation.
I firmly believe that the President of the country should  guide  our  newly
attained democracy by advocating coexistence and harmony  in  South  Africa.
We all dream of a better life and a better society. I  am  inspired  by  the
ideas that I gleaned from Brian Weiss's book Messages From The Masters  that
says, and I quote:


  It has become difficult to go through a  complete  day  without  becoming
  disillusioned, disappointed and  drained  by  the  mean-spirited  selfish
  people who surround us. So many people seem  to  be  interested  only  in
  their personal gain. They have become rude  and  arrogant,  critical  and
  insensitive. Not only do their actions drag us down, but most of us  feel
  that there is nothing that we can do to change this, that only  those  in
  power have the capacity to make a difference.


  Changing the world from  its  current  violent,  competitive  hate-filled
  nature will not happen through the efforts of  only  a  few  individuals,
  even if they are powerful world leaders. Rather, the day-to-day  acts  of
  kindness and compassion shared between people and within small groups can
  bring about the change to make a more loving  and  kinder  place.  People
  have to understand that we are equal, all the same, all  striving  for  a
  little peacefulness, happiness and security in everyday life.

The hon the President has the  power  to  create  the  environment  for  the
country. We are here for him to use us, all of us, from both  sides  of  the
floor.

In a lighter vein, let me share with the President and this  House  this:  I
have an eight-and-a-half-year-old  daughter,  Makha,  who  has  a  nose  for
birthdays. Every time it is somebody's birthday, she will  wake  up  in  the
morning and sing happy birthday. Indeed, today I was surprised  because  she
phoned me this morning and told me that she had forgotten to hand me a  card
that she wanted me to give to the hon the President. On behalf of Makha  and
all of us, I wish the hon the President a happy 60th  birthday.  We  support
the budget. [Applause.]

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Mev die Speaker, agb President  en  agb  Adjunkpresident,
die agb Oosthuizen is reg wanneer hy sê dat dit ons  almal  se  plig  is  om
Suid-Afrika te máák werk. Ek wil ongelukkig nie weer betrokke  raak  by  die
ou debat tussen hom en die agb Aucamp oor wie wel en wie  nie  'n  Afrikaner
is nie.

Die agb Cupido het hier met 'n tirade ter velde getrek  teen  die  Nuwe  NP.
Die eenvoudige waarheid is dat die Nuwe NP deel is van Suid-Afrika en  hulle
sal help om Suid-Afrika  'n  sukses  te  maak.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  In  plaas
daarvan om met die Nuwe NP te baklei, dink ek daardie agb lid het baie  meer
probleme om na om te sien as wat die Nuwe NP het.

Ek wil verwys na die artikel in die Sunday Times van 19 Mei, waar  Mnr  Carl
Werth sê dat hy in één jaar meer die ``K''-woord gehoor het as in tien  jaar
by die Konserwatiewe Party.[Tussenwerpsels.] Carl Werth lig die  sluier  oor
wie en wat die DP werklik is wanneer hy sê dit is 'n mengelmoes van  oud-AWB
lede, Herstigte NP lede en al wat regses is.

Verder sou ek, indien ek hulle was, my veel eerder bemoei  en  bekommer  het
oor die skerp daling in hul steun. Meer as  50%  van  hul  steun  het  hulle
verloor. Hulle sal hard moet werk om dit op 11% te  hou,  want  wanneer  die
oorloopklousule goedgekeur word, gaan die groter meerderheid mense  oorloop,
diegene wat onder die vaandel van die DA deur die Nuwe NP daar  geplaas  is,
en dán kan ons nog 'n verdere 50% daling in hul steun verwag.

Ek wil aan die agb  President  sê  dat  sy  inisiatief  aangaande  die  Nuwe
Vennootskap vir  Afrika  se  Ontwikkeling  'n  waardige  en  'n  edele  doel
nastreef. Ons moet egter 'n paar dinge reguit sê. Eerstens, baie  min  mense
in Afrika definieer armoede korrek,  want  die  helfte  praat  van  armoede-
verligting, ander praat  van  armoede-uitwissing,  terwyl  ander  praat  van
armoede-bekamping. Ons sal hierdie probleem moet aanspreek.

Armoede-verligting vind reeds plaas. Die Regering voorsien behuising,  asook
gratis onderwys en mediese dienste. Ons verskaf maatskaplike pensioene.  Dít
is armoede-verligting en ons is reeds daarmee  besig.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Jy
het nie vir my werk nie, en jy sal nooit werk kry nie! [Applous.] [Gelag.]

As ons egter praat van die uitwissing van armoede, wil ek die agb  President
die versekering gee dat dit 'n onbegonne taak is. Nêrens  in  die  land  het
die Regering daarin geslaag om armoede uit te wis nie, en  daarom  moet  ons
ons veel eerder toespits op armoede-bekamping, en  hier  moet  ons  ook  vir
mekaar reguit sê dat daar twee soorte ... [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ons hoor so baie van werkloosheid, maar dit het tyd geword dat ons  dit  reg
definieer,  want  daar   bestaan   in   Suid-Afrika   ook   so   iets   soos
werklusteloosheid. Ek haal my hoed af vir die vrouens wat in  die  townships
bly en elke oggend vroeg per bus vertrek om by twee verskillende  plekke  te
gaan werk as huishulpe.

AGB LEDE: Hoor! Hoor! [Applous.]

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Daardie mense verdien geld sodat hul elke  dag  kos  voor
hul kinders op die tafel kan sit, terwyl daar mans is wat by  die  huis  sit
en TV kyk en sê hulle kan nie werk kry nie. Ons sal  hierdie  probleem  moet
aanspreek, en ons sal hulle moet registreer sodat ons hulle kan dwing om  te
gaan werk.

Net soos Nostradamus die voorval van 11 September verlede  jaar  reeds  lank
gelede voorspel het, het ons ook 'n profeet hier  in  Suid-Afrika  wat  baie
dinge reg voorspel het. Hy het, onder meer,  die  vroeë  vrylating  van  Mnr
Nelson Mandela korrek voorspel. Alles wat hy tot  dusver  voorspel  het,  is
bewaarheid.

In 'n ope brief aan oud-president P W Botha het Credo Mutwa geskryf, ``  Let
not my country die''. Vandag is dit ook ons wekroep dat  ons  nie  ons  land
wil laat sterwe nie, en deur Nepad sal ons moet help toesien dat Afrika  nie
ten gronde gaan nie. 'n Baie goeie voorbeeld was die boere wat vanuit  Suid-
Afrika gegaan het om landerye in Mosambiek te help bewerk. Die  dag  wanneer
die geskiedenis herskryf word, sal daar nie van ons gesê kan  word  dat  ons
gefaal het net omdat ons nie probeer het  nie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C B Herandien: Madam Speaker, hon President and  hon  Deputy  President,
the hon Oosthuizen is correct when he says that all of us  have  a  duty  to
make South Africa work. Unfortunately I do not want to get involved  in  the
old debate between him  and  the  hon  Aucamp  again  about  who  should  be
regarded as an Afrikaner and who should not.

Right here the hon Cupido lashed out against the New NP  in  a  tirade.  The
plain truth of the matter is that the New NP is part  of  South  Africa  and
they will  help  to  contribute  towards  making  South  Africa  a  success.
[Interjections.] Instead of fighting with the New NP,  I  believe  that  the
hon member has more problems to deal with than the New NP.
I want to refer to an article in the Sunday Times of May 19, where  Mr  Carl
Werth states that in one year he heard the ``K"-word more often than in  his
10 years in the Conservative Party. [Interjections.] Carl Werth exposes  the
DP for who and what they really are when he refers to them as a  mixture  of
ex-AWB members, Herstigte NP members and other rightwingers.

Furthermore, if I were them, I would much rather  involve  myself  with  the
sharp decline in their support. They  have  lost  more  than  50%  of  their
support. They will have to work hard to keep it at 11%, because as  soon  as
the floor-crossing clause is approved, the greater majority  of  the  people
who, under the banner of the DA, was placed there by the New NP, will  cross
the floor and then we can expect another 50% decline in their support.

I would like to say to the hon President that  his  initiative  regarding  a
New Partnership for Africa's Development pursues a worthy and  noble  cause.
However, there are few things that  we  should  say  in  a  straight-forward
manner. Firstly, very few people in Africa define poverty correctly  because
some talk about poverty relief,  others  about  poverty  eradication,  while
others talk about combating poverty. We will have to address this problem.

Poverty relief is already happening. The Government provides  housing,  also
free education and medical services. We provide  social  pensions.  This  is
poverty relief and we are currently involved in it. [Interjections.] You  do
not have work for me, and you will never find work! [Applause.] [Laughter.]

However, when we talk about the eradication of poverty,  I  want  to  assure
the hon President that it is indeed an  impossible  task.  Nowhere  in  this
country did the Government manage to eradicate  poverty,  and  therefore  we
should much rather focus on combating poverty, and even here  we  should  be
candid about the two types ... [Interjections.]

We often hear about unemployment, but the time has come for us to define  it
correctly,  because  in  South  Africa  there  is  also   something   called
``werklusteloosheid'' [lethargy for work]. I take my hat off to those  women
who live in the townships, and travel by  bus  early  every  morning  to  do
domestic work in two different places.

HON MEMBERS: Hear! Hear! [Applause.]

Mr C B HERANDIEN: Those people are earning money which allows  them  to  put
food on the table for  their  children  every  day,  whilst  there  are  men
sitting at home watching TV, claiming that they are unable to find work.  We
will have to address this problem  by  registering  them  and  in  this  way
coerce them into finding employment.

In the same way that Nostradamus had already  predicted  the  events  of  11
September long ago, we have  our  own  prophet  here  in  South  Africa  who
accurately predicted many things. He has, amongst others  things,  correctly
predicted the early release of Mr Nelson Mandela. So far everything  he  has
predicted has come true.

In an open letter to ex-president P W Botha, Credo Mutwa  wrote:  ``Let  not
my country die.'' Today it is also our clarion call that we do not want  our
country to die, and through Nepad we will help to ensure  that  Africa  does
not die. A very good example of this is the farmers who  left  South  Africa
to  help  cultivate  the  farmlands  in  Mozambique.  The  day  history   is
rewritten, at least it could not be said that we failed because we  did  not
try. [Applause.]]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, the President, the Deputy  President  and  I
all share a birth year - 1942. If I may say so, it was a vintage  year.  The
difference between these hon gentlemen and I is that they both  seem  to  be
joining the ranks of senior  citizens,  whereas  I  regard  myself  as  only
approaching early middle-age. [Laughter.]

I was sent in to respond to the debate. The problem  is  that  there  is  so
little to respond to. The hon Essop Pahad is  usually  good-value-for-money,
but today he was, quite frankly, boring. [Interjections.] He gabbled  off  a
speech written for him by his  officials.  At  least  he  did  stay  out  of
trouble, and that is something.

Then we had the hon Jeremy Cronin. He holds a world record. He is  the  most
enthusiastic communist in  the  world.  [Interjections.]  And  he  gives  us
lectures on liberalism. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Dan was daar die agb Gert Oosthuizen wat 'n groot ophef gemaak  het  oor  sy
Afrikanerskap. Hy  het  ons  genooi  om  deel  te  word  van  die  politieke
herskikking. Wat beteken dit? Dit is presies dieselfde toespraak wat  hy  al
die  jare  onder  P  W  Botha  gemaak  het!   [Tussenwerpsels.]   [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Then there was the hon Gert Oosthuizen  who  made  much  of  his  Afrikaner
character. He invited us to become  part  of  the  political  restructuring.
What does that mean? That is exactly the same speech as the one he made  for
years under P W Botha! [interjections.] [Applause.]]

The same speech! [Interjections.] The problem with Gert Oosthuizen  is  that
he stays loyal to his leader  until  he  finds  a  new  leader.  [Laughter.]
Talking of which: Mr Martinus van Schalkwyk said goodbye. Now,  the  problem
with Mr Van Schalkwyk is that he has never forgiven Tony  Leon  for  beating
him in 1999. He was the leader of the opposition, and the voters  threw  him
out.  [Interjections.]  He  talked  about  arrogance  and  superiority.  The
problem is that he is inferior; the voters  told  him  that,  and  he  feels
inferior to Tony Leon and he cannot get over that. [Interjections.]

He referred to Jean Le Pen, the Neo-Nazi leader in France. I say to  Mr  Van
Schalkwyk that he should be ashamed of that.  [Interjections.]  But  he,  of
course, would know about Neo-Nazis. When he was a paid military spy  of  the
apartheid government, he must have had plenty of those  people  around  him.
[Interjections.] The difference between him and  them  is  that  he  is  not
right-wing and he is not left-wing. [Interjections.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, is it correct to refer to  an  hon  member  of
this House as a spy?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Gibson, I would like you  to  withdraw  that,
please.

Mr  D  H  M  GIBSON:  Madam  Speaker,  I  will  withdraw  it  if  you  like.
[Interjections.] That hon member is not right-wing or left-wing  or  a  Neo-
Nazi or a fascist or anything else. He is a gun  for  hire.  And  he  proves
that, depending on the size of the cheque, a leopard can change  its  spots.
I say goodbye to Mr Van Schalkwyk. [Interjections.]

I support a new electoral system for South Africa, which is  going  to  make
members of Parliament more responsive to the people, to the voters,  instead
of playing politicians' games. [Interjections.] We want a  system  which  is
going to ensure that people are responsive to the voters.

I want to be able to stand up in this House  and  plead  the  cause  of  the
voters in my area and ask why an area which voted so overwhelmingly for  the
ANC is so neglected by the ANC. [Interjections.] Why  are  there  no  street
lights? Why are there no street names? Why are the houses not numbered?  Why
are there no trees? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order!

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, will this  excited  member  take  a  question?
[Laughter.]
Mr D H M GIBSON: No, Madam Speaker.  [Interjections.]  [Laughter.]  Why  are
the streets and  pavements  neglected?  Why  are  there  so  few  parks  and
playgrounds?  Why  is  the   police   station   grossly   understaffed   and
underequipped? Why is crime so high? Why do 2 000 children, my  children  in
Ivory Park and Ebony Park have to attend unregistered  schools  because  the
state has failed them? [Interjections.] There are no  schools  for  them  to
attend.

It is the job of members of Parliament to bring this  to  the  attention  of
the President. [Interjections.] If we do not do it, who will?  I  hope  that
the President's ANC is not going to play games with Minister  Buthelezi  and
Dr Van Zyl Slabbert who was appointed by  Minister  Buthelezi.  I  hope  the
President is going to take seriously the calls for reform of  electoral  law
in South Africa  so  that  we  will  have  a  system  in  which  members  of
Parliament   represent   the   people    and    represent    constituencies.
[Interjections.] I appeal to the President. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, in his speech,  Mr  Gibson  referred  to  Mr  Van
Schalkwyk as `a gun for hire'.  I  believe  that  that  is  synonymous  with
mercenary, and I submit that that is  unparliamentary  and  that  Mr  Gibson
should withdraw that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Gibson, if you said that,  please  do  withdraw  it.
[Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, are you ruling that  `a  gun  for  hire'  is
unparliamentary?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes,  Mr  Gibson.  Hon  Gibson,  I  would  like  you  to
withdraw that.

Mr  D  H  M  GIBSON:  Oh,  well,  he  is  leaving  us,  so  I  withdraw  it.
[Interjections.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, I usually try to  respond  to  a  previous
speaker, but unfortunately there was nothing to respond to.  Suffice  it  to
say that the mere fact that the  hon  Douglas  Gibson  participated  in  the
debate is a clear indication that the DA  is  in  serious  trouble,  because
whenever the chips are down, they send the hon  Gibson  in  to  speak  in  a
debate. [Interjections.] But, having listened to him, the only conclusion  I
can  come  to  is  that  the  DA  is  still  in  trouble!   [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] [Applause.]
I welcome the President to the club of 60. According to an article in  Time,
the hon President revels in Socratic  philosophical  debate.  Now  this,  of
course, could be a dangerous exercise.

Socrates was unfairly sentenced to death because he did not believe  in  the
gods that the state of  Athens  believed  in.  We  all  know  that  the  hon
President also does not always believe in the gods that the  state  believes
in and hopefully, proverbially speaking,  the  fate  of  Socrates  will  not
befall the hon President. [Laughter.]

My wish for the hon President on his birthday is that  the  New  Partnership
for Africa's Development will be a  huge  success,  despite  the  fact  that
colonel Gaddafi referred to it as a project of the former  colonialists  and
racists. The mere fact that the hon President, nevertheless,  convinced  him
to pledge his support to Nepad, shows that  the  President  owns  the  title
``salesman of Nepad'', as attributed to him by Time magazine.

I do not have the time to elaborate on all the virtues of Nepad,  except  to
say that Nepad is Africa's way  of  accepting  responsibility  for  its  own
destiny. Nepad is the engine that will drive  economic  development  on  the
continent, with a view to eradicating poverty. [Applause.]

What clearly distinguishes Nepad from other recovery plans  so  far  is  the
fact that the envisaged peer  review  mechanism  will  allow  other  African
states to place  pressure  on  members  of  Nepad  to  adhere  to  objective
criteria pertaining to democracy, good governance and peace.

It would be appreciated if the hon  the  President  could  indicate  to  the
House what these  objective  criteria  would  entail.  I  believe  that  the
objective criteria will have to be approved at the G-8 summit in  Canada  by
the end of this month.

The success of Nepad depends entirely on the successful functioning  of  the
peer review mechanism but, ironically, the peer  review  mechanism  is  also
the Achilles heel of Nepad. Unfortunately, membership of the  African  Union
does not mean that states have an obligation to sign the  Nepad  declaration
on peer review. Signing the Nepad declaration will  be  entirely  voluntary.
States that choose not to sign the declaration will, in other words, not  be
subjected to peer review and need  not  adhere  to  criteria  such  as  good
governance, democracy and peace.

If Nepad is to succeed, if economic development  on  this  continent  is  to
become a reality and if the 21st century is, indeed, to  belong  to  Africa,
then I think the signing of the Nepad declaration should be made  compulsory
to all African Union members.

Vandag was die agb lid Marthinus van Schalkwyk  se  laaste  optrede  in  dié
Huis  in  sy  hoedanigheid  as  leier  van  die  Nuwe  NP,  voordat  hy  die
premierskap van die Weskaap aanvaar. [Applous.] Anders as te kenne gegee  is
deur  die  agb  Gibson,  is  die  agb  lid  Van  Schalkwyk  'n   formidabele
Parlementariër en sy toespraak hier vanmiddag het dit  bewys.  Die  Nuwe  NP
sal sy doelgerigte leiding in hierdie Huis mis. Ons  wil  hom  veral  bedank
vir die rol wat hy gespeel het en nog steeds speel  in  die  herrangskikking
van die Suid-Afrikaanse politieke landskap ten  einde  te  voldoen  aan  die
eise van 'n moderne en inheemse demokrasie; iets wat  my  vriende  hier  aan
die linkerkant nie altyd verstaan nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons wens hom  alles
van die beste toe as premier van die Weskaap. Stabiliteit in  die  Weskaapse
politiek kan nie langer uitgestel word nie. Die Nuwe NP ondersteun  die  pos
van die agb President en ons wens mnr Van Schalkwyk alles van die beste  toe
op  die  pad  vorentoe.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[Today was the hon member Marthinus van Schalkwyk's last appearance in  this
House in his capacity as leader  of  the  New  NP,  before  he  accepts  the
premiership of the Western  Cape.  [Applause.]  Contrary  to  what  the  hon
Gibson  implied,  the   hon   member   Van   Schalkwyk   is   a   formidable
parliamentarian and his speech here this afternoon has  been  the  proof  of
that. The New NP will miss his  purposeful  leadership  in  this  House.  We
especially want to thank him for the role that he has played  and  continues
to play in the rearrangement of the South  African  political  landscape  in
order to cope with  the  demands  of  a  modern  and  indigenous  democracy;
something which my  friends  here  on  the  left-hand  side  do  not  always
understand. [Interjections.] We wish him everything of the best  as  premier
of the Western Cape. Stability with regard to the politics  of  the  Western
Cape can no longer be delayed. The new NP supports the Vote of the  hon  the
President and we wish Mr van Schalkwyk everything of the best  on  the  road
ahead. [Applause.]]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Speaker, Comrade President, Comrade  Deputy  President,
hon members and comrades, the honoured place that South  Africa  has  earned
in international affairs is indicated by  the  number  of  conferences  that
this country will be hosting during the course of this year alone.

Our country's commitment to sustainable  development  reflects  the  lessons
that we have learned from our past and the obligations we have  collectively
accepted about the future we are trying to build as a nation.

We  have  learned  that  inequality  is  unsustainable,  that   tyranny   is
unsustainable and that social injustice  is  unsustainable.  Experience  has
taught us that democracy, equality, social  justice  and  participation  are
essential for any project to be sustainable over time.

In the preparations for the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  that
this country will be hosting in  September,  South  Africa  was  among  that
group  of  countries  which  sought  to  take  the   summit   beyond   pious
declarations. Instead, we have  insisted  on  an  action-oriented  programme
that stresses the eradication of poverty. Degrading  levels  of  poverty  in
many parts of the world remain the single greatest  obstacle  in  the  quest
for sustainable development.

While it is widely  accepted  that  unbridled  and  unregulated  pursuit  of
private profit has  led  to  environmental  degradation,  there  are  still,
regrettably, some heads of state who insist  that  the  standard  of  living
enjoyed by their countries comes first. The South Africa we  inherited  from
the previous government is living proof of the folly of such policies.

As a nation, we South Africans have resolved to embark on a different  path.
That resolve is expressed in our Constitution which recognises the right  of
every individual to a clean and healthy environment, and  also  ensures  the
protection and preservation of our natural heritage for future generations.

South Africa's approach to the summit has, therefore, been informed  by  the
need not only to raise the living standards and the quality of life  of  the
world's poor, but also to reposition the developing nations  in  the  global
economy so as  to  enhance  their  individual  and  collective  capacity  to
address the issue of poverty. Our Government demonstrated its commitment  to
those outcomes by the levels of representation we sent to Bali.

Poverty can impact on the environment in a  number  of  ways.  The  poor  in
developing countries hardly  have  the  opportunity  to  think  through  the
consequences of the overutilisation of resources, because their priority  is
survival. Governments in developing countries,  spurred  by  the  imperative
economic growth as the key to prosperity, may also  be  tempted  to  embrace
ecologically unsound development strategies.

The eradication of poverty must now be firmly established as a truly  cross-
sectoral issue  that  features  prominently  in  all  global,  regional  and
national policies as the key to sustainable  development.  That  requires  a
working partnership among the developed and developing countries,  aimed  at
meeting the basic needs of people and closing the yawning  disparities  that
divide the human family into the rich north and the impoverished south.

Such a partnership should  be  premised  on  the  universal  acknowledgement
that, unless we accept collective  responsibility  for  the  future  of  the
planet, there is no nation on earth whose future will not  be  in  jeopardy.
Put another way, we could say that we are all required to choose  between  a
fatherland and mother earth.

When posed in these terms, the unwillingness  of  leaders  of  many  of  the
developed countries to adopt a more responsible attitude  is  all  the  more
alarming. Poverty has degraded and can continue to degrade the  environment,
but it is nonetheless true that a child born in  a  developed  country  adds
more to the consumption and pollution  over  his  lifetime  than  30  to  50
children born in a developing country.

It is also true that since 1950, the developed countries, because  of  their
high incomes and consumption levels, have accounted for well over  half  the
increase in resource use. It is also true that 20%  of  the  world's  people
living in the highest  income  countries  account  for  53%  of  the  carbon
dioxide emissions, while the poorest 20% account for only 3%.

In this regard, let it also be noted that Brazil,  China,  India,  Indonesia
and Mexico,  who  are  among  the  developing  countries  with  the  highest
emissions, despite their high populations, their per  capita  emissions  are
still a tiny 3,9 metric tonne per year for Mexico and 2,7 metric  tonne  for
China.

When one compares that with the 20,5 metric tonne per capita for the  United
States and the 10,2 tonne for Germany, it is clear who needs to do  more  to
clean up their act.

The consequences  of  global  warming  will  be  devastating  to  many  poor
countries. It is estimated that with a rise in the  sea  level,  Bangladesh,
which is one of the poorest countries in the world, could see its land  area
shrink by 17%. Almost a billion  people  in  40  developing  countries  risk
losing access to their primary source of protein, as overfishing, driven  by
export, and a demand for animal feed and  oils  deplete  the  oceans's  fish
stock. Of the 44 billion people living in  developing  countries,  close  to
60% lack basic sanitation. Almost a third have no access to clean water.

These contrasts should not be read as a plea for equalising poverty  or  for
levelling downwards. What they do  indicate  is  that  while  promoting  and
expanding opportunities and a better  quality  of  life  for  all,  we  must
accept the need to regulate economic activity in the interest of our  future
survival. They underscore the urgency of operationalising the  principle  of
common but differentiated responsibilities.

The application of environmentally sound technology is an  important  factor
in  achieving  sustainable  development.  Enhancing  access  by   developing
countries to such technologies has correctly been identified as a  priority.
However, insufficient attention is given to technologies, developed,  tested
and successively applied, in developing countries. Often  such  technologies
are developed with the  capital  and  technical  assistance  from  developed
countries.

Urgent attention should therefore be given  to  determining  the  level  and
extent of such existing local technologies in developing countries,  and  to
facilitating the transfer of such relevant technologies on  a  regional  and
interregional basis. What we are suggesting is that the north-south flow  of
environmentally sound technology should be  complemented  by  a  south-south
flow of such technology.

The  United  Nations'  target  of  0,7%  of  GDP  for  official  development
assistance  has,  regrettably,  been  honoured  more  in  breach   than   in
observance. We require a swifter resolution of  the  debt  problems  of  the
highly indebted countries, building on the progress made  in  recent  years.
All these are matters that we hope will feature on the summit's agenda.

The experience of Africa teaches us that it is foolhardy, if not  dangerous,
to embark on development projects that disempower the very people  they  are
supposed to benefit.  This  emphasises  the  importance  of  democratic  and
accountable  government  as  inseparable  from  the  quest  for  sustainable
development.

The African Union and Nepad, in both of which the hon Comrade President  has
played a role, are premised on precisely such recognition. As Africans,  the
success of the World Summit on Sustainable  Development  will  be  one  more
factor  complementing  our  efforts  for  the  realisation  of  the  African
century.

Many happy returns to the hon the President. [Applause.]

Debate interrupted.

                  party as contemplated in section 61(2)(b), with  the  same
                  surplus in sequence of votes recorded, starting  with  the
                  party or merged party which recorded  the  highest  number
                  of votes, including  combined  votes  in  the  case  of  a
                  merged party, during the last election for the  provincial
                  legislature concerned, but if any of the parties with  the
                  same surplus-
                  (a)  came into existence on account of  changes  of  party
                       membership or  subdivision  of  parties  within  that
                       legislature as contemplated in section 61(2)(b); and
                  (b)  did not participate in  the  last  election  for  the
                       provincial legislature concerned,
                  the legislature must allocate the undistributed  delegates
                  in the delegation to the party or parties  with  the  same
                  surplus in a manner which is consistent with democracy.".

         The  Select  Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,
         having  considered  the  subject  of  the  Loss  or  Retention   of

         NEW CLAUSE
         1. That the following be a New Clause:


              Amendment of section 2 of Act 69 of 1998


                2.     Section 2 of the Determination of Delegates (National
              Council of Provinces) Act, 1998,  is  hereby  amended  by  the
              substitution for subsection (4) of the following subsection:
                  "(4)  (a)  If  the  total  number  of  special   delegates
                determined in terms  of  subsection  (3)  in  respect  of  a
                particular provincial legislature is  less  than  four,  the
                delegates of the parties  that  are  entitled  to  only  one
                delegate in the delegation of that  province  must,  despite
                subsection (1), become special  delegates  in  the  sequence
                from the lowest to the highest number  of  votes,  including
                combined votes in the case of a merged party as contemplated
                in section 61(2)(b) of  the  Constitution,  that  have  been
                recorded for those parties during the last election of  that
                provincial legislature, until four  special  delegates  have
                been allocated to  parties  in  the  provincial  delegation:
                Provided that if any of the parties  that  are  entitled  to
                only one delegate in the delegation of that province -
                (i)    came into existence on account of  changes  of  party
                       membership or  subdivision  of  parties  within  that
                       legislature as contemplated in  section  61(2)(b)  of
                       the Constitution; and
                (ii)   did not participate in  the  last  election  of  that
                       provincial legislature,
                the legislature must, in a manner which is  consistent  with
                democracy, elect so many delegates  from  the  delegates  of
                those  parties  to  become  special  delegates  as  may   be
                necessary to allocate four special delegates to  parties  in
                the provincial delegation.
                  (b)  If the total number of special  delegates  determined
                in terms of  subsection  (3)  in  respect  of  a  particular
                provincial legislature is  more  than  four,  those  special
                delegates must, despite  subsections  (2)  and  (3),  become
                permanent delegates in the sequence from the highest to  the
                lowest number of votes, including combined votes in the case
                of a merged party as contemplated in section 61(2)(b) of the
                Constitution,  that  have  been  recorded  for  the  parties
                concerned  during  the  last  election  of  that  provincial
                legislature,  until  four  special   delegates   have   been
                allocated to parties in the provincial delegation:  Provided
                that if any of those parties-
                (i)    came into existence on account of  changes  of  party
                       membership or  subdivision  of  parties  within  that
                       legislature as contemplated in  section  61(2)(b)  of
                       the Constitution; and
                (ii)   did not participate in  the  last  election  of  that
                       provincial legislature,
                that legislature must, despite subsections (2) and  (3)  and
                in a manner which is consistent  with  democracy,  elect  so
                many special delegates of those parties to become  permanent
                delegates as  may  be  required  to  allocate  four  special
                delegates to parties in the provincial delegation.".
