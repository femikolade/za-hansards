                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, on behalf of the DP I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) condemns  the  recent  series  of  terrorist  blasts  in  Soweto  and
       Bronkhorstspruit;


  (2) specifically condemns the attacks on religious sites as cowardly  and
       as an attack on the constitutionally guaranteed right of  freedom  to
       follow and worship in the faith of one's choice;


  (3) expresses the conviction that far from polarising South  Africans  on
       racial lines, such conduct will unite all South Africans in  a  quest
       to put an end to the evil of terrorism; and


  (4) expresses its solidarity and condolences to those affected  by  these
       cowardly acts of terrorism.

[Applause.]

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the percentage of the population  in  every  province  that  has
           either  restricted  or  no  access  to  sufficient,   safe   and
           nutritious food, namely the Eastern Cape 48%,  Free  State  48%,
           Gauteng 12%, KwaZulu-Natal 26%,  Limpopo  38%,  Mpumalanga  25%,
           Northern Cape 35%, North West 37% and the Western Cape 12%;


       (b)  that there was an increase in poverty and the number  of  people
           suffering a serious food shortage for the reasons  mentioned  on
           Wednesday,  30  October  2002,  by  the  hon  the  Minister  for
           Agriculture and Land Affairs in reply to a question I posed; and


       (c)  that a  number  of  initiatives  have  been  taken  in  all  the
           provinces in  order  to  find  solutions  to  this  unacceptable
           situation; and


  (2) requests all the premiers of the different provinces, at the earliest
       possible  suitable  date,  which  date  must  be  determined  by  the
       Chairperson of this Council, to report back to this Council either in
       person or through  the  responsible  provincial  minister  about  the
       reasons for the state of affairs with regard to  the  initiatives  in
       this connection in their respective provinces.]

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, I give notice that at the next sitting  of  this
House I will move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  there are 29 operational gambling casinos in South Africa  which
           generated some R439 million in tax for the financial year ending
           31 March 2002; and


       (b)  these 29 casinos are being  regulated  by  a  National  Gambling
           Board and nine regional boards  comprising  a  Chairman,  CEO's,
           board members and a total staff complement of 274 people with  a
           total budget of some R120 million, consuming about a quarter  of
           all tax paid;


  (2) given the fact that there are uniform norms and  standards,  applying
       generally throughout the  country  on  gambling,  and  uniformity  of
       legislation, calls upon the Government to -


       (a)  place a moratorium on all new gambling licences;


       (b)  disband the gambling boards in the nine provinces;


       (c)  require the highest degree of self regulation by  the  industry;
           and
       (d)  seek a more cost-effective way of regulating this industry; and


  (3) requests the Government, that is currently  studying  the  impact  of
       legalised gambling in South Africa since 1994, also to  consider  the
       huge social cost and moral damage caused by this industry.

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
this House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the final report of the UN panel on the Illegal Exploitation  of
           Natural Resources and other Forms of Wealth  of  the  DRC  found
           that ruling elites of the Governments of the DRC, Rwanda, Uganda
           and  Zimbabwe  are   involved   in   criminal   activities   and
           exploitation of natural and fiscal resources; and


       (b)  the Zimbabwean defence minister proposed that a company  be  set
           up in Mauritius to disguise the continuing economic interests of
           the Zimbabwe defence force in the DRC; and


  (2) calls on President Mbeki to give assurances that -


       (a)  ``silent diplomacy''  is  confronting  Zimbabwe's  new  resource
           colonialism in the DRC; and


       (b)  South Africans implicated in the report are under investigation.

                             DROWNING IN PRIESKA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness the drowning of four boys at the unused  municipal
       swimming pool in Prieska;


  (2) notes further that the bodies of  Ivan  Malgas  (10  years),  Brenden
       Beyers (10 years), Greshan Petoors (9 years) and  Goddfrey  Olyn  (11
       years) were found in water that was two  metres deep;


  (3) expresses concern that the water  level  in  the  swimming  pool  was
       allowed to rise to two metres, but that no effort was made to  secure
       the swimming pool except for a wooden fence around it;


  (4) calls on the relevant municipality to take appropriate and  immediate
       steps to make the swimming pool safe to prevent tragedies  like  this
       from happening in the future; and


  (5) expresses its sincere condolences to the parents and families of  the
       four boys.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     CONGRATULATIONS TO MARTHA MOSOAHLE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates Martha Mosoahle, a teacher from  Gauteng,  on  becoming
       the first African woman to captain the national senior netball  team,
       the Proteas, which left for New Zealand last Sunday to play in a  two
       test series against the Silver Ferns;


  (2)  congratulates  Netball  South  Africa  on  their  efforts  to  fully
       transform the sport and give it a truly  South  African  identity  as
       opposed to the unrepresentative complexion of some prominent national
       male teams;


  (3) notes that in a  society  bereft  of  female  sport  role-models,  Ms
       Mosoahle's achievement will engender enormous amounts  of  enthusiasm
       and interest in netball amongst young girls across South Africa; and


  (4)  believes  that  since  netball  is  now   leading   the   way   with
       transformation and representivity, corporate South Africa  and  Sport
       and Recreation South Africa will use  this  exciting  opportunity  to
       ensure that infrastructure and player development  is  given  further
       impetus.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         BUS ACCIDENT IN MPUMALANGA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) extends its heartfelt  condolences  to  the  diplomatic  missions  of
       Britain, Canada and Germany and the peoples of  these  countries  for
       the loss of life of their citizens in a bus accident in Mpumalanga;


  (2) lauds the co-ordinated emergency measures  taken  by  the  Mpumalanga
       health and traffic authorities to  ensure  that  those  injured  were
       swiftly airlifted to hospitals for specialised medical treatment;


  (3) notes that this accident  should  be  viewed  as  what  it  has  been
       reported to be until a full investigation by the relevant authorities
       into its causes has been completed;


  (4) expresses the hope that this accident  will  not  in  any  way  deter
       tourists from touring this province with  its  beautiful  people  and
       spectacular scenery; and


  (5) assures these countries and their  citizens  of  safe  and  memorable
       journeys through a province where the gods of nature have left  their
       indelible footprints.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            BOMB BLASTS IN SOWETO

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) strongly condemns the cowardly actions of those who were  responsible
       for the multiple bomb blasts that rocked Soweto and  Bronkhorstspruit
       on Wednesday, 30 October  2002,  leaving  one  person  dead  and  two
       injured;


  (2) commends the SA Police Service, especially the  Bomb  Disposal  Unit,
       for managing to avert further bomb damage by  defusing  an  explosive
       device left in a sports bag at a filling station, near a Soweto  taxi
       rank, late on Tuesday night;


  (3)  notes  with  concern  the  latest  reports  which  imply  that   the
       perpetrators of this crime want to  destroy  infrastructure  such  as
       dams and railway lines and other areas  of  strategic  importance  to
       disrupt the smooth running of our country;


  (4) calls on the  Minister  of  Safety  and  Security,  Charles  Nqakula,
       together with Police Commissioner  Jackie  Selebi,  to  redouble  all
       efforts to bring all terror groups to book, as they did earlier  this
       year when police uncovered a plot  by  right-wingers  to  topple  the
       Government and have since charged 15 people in  connection  with  the
       alleged plot; and


  (5) appeals  to  all  South  Africans  regardless  of  race,  colour,  or
       religious affiliation, to assist the police with any information they
       may have that can lead to the apprehension of those  involved  in  an
       attempt to destabilise a South Africa that we have fought  very  hard
       to liberate from all forms of oppression.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the sixth Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement -
       (a)  will promote greater certainty and predictability in our  budget
           process;


       (b)  outlines a bold programme of action for national and  provincial
           departments, municipalities and government agencies; and


       (c)   proposes  a  framework  that  provides  for  real   growth   in
           expenditure on public services, with particular  emphasis  given
           to social services provided by provincial departments;


  (2) welcomes the  increased  expenditure  on  social  infrastructure  and
       development, which is  commensurate  with  commitments  to  eradicate
       poverty;


  (3) therefore congratulates the National Treasury of South Africa on  the
       prompt release of its Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement; and


   (4)      further wishes the Joint  Budget  Committee,  which  will  bring
       together members of the National Assembly and this Council,  success
       as they go about deliberating the Statement.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:

       accident.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C NKUNA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) reaffirms the existence  of  an  intrinsic  link  between  peace  and
       development;


  (2) reiterates its support for the efforts of President Thabo  Mbeki  and
       Deputy President Jacob Zuma, who have worked earnestly to resolve the
       conflict in the DRC, by promoting a common  understanding  among  the
       conflicting parties that development in the  region  and  Africa  can

  (3)  welcomes  the  latest  initiatives  in  the  DRC,  particularly  the

       the ideals embodied in Nepad.

                 SUSTAINABLE USE OF MARINE LIVING RESOURCES

                             (Draft Resolution)

       the Ministry of Environmental Affairs and Tourism  to  elaborate  and
       implement policies and strategies to achieve sustainable use  of  our

       been shown by some people and companies towards  these  policies  and
       strategies by continuing to plunder our marine living resources;


  (3) welcomes the impounding of a fish trawler and its illegally harvested
       catch by the Scorpions and the Department  of  Environmental  Affairs
       and Tourism; and


  (4) believes  this  arrest  will  send  out  a  clear  message  that  the
       Government will not tolerate the  plundering  of  our  marine  living
       resources.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       FAREWELL TO DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I have been informed by the  other
House that the  presiding  officers  have  received  notification  that  the
President of South Africa has approved the recommendation  of  the  National
Assembly that Mr M L Mushwana be appointed  as  Public  Protector  of  South
Africa. [Applause.]

Given this rather unwelcome development, I would  like,  on  behalf  of  the
National Council of Provinces and myself, to  bid  farewell  to  our  Deputy
Chairperson, Mr Mabedle Mushwana. Mr Mushwana is a  long-serving  member  of
Parliament,  having  joined  the  institution  after  the  first  democratic
elections in 1994. He joined Parliament as a senator in the then Senate  and
was one of the members who participated in the  establishment  of  this  new
institution - the  National  Council  of  Provinces.  He  served,  when  the
Council was established, as its first  Chairperson  of  Committees.  He  was
elected as Deputy Chairperson in 1998, a position he  has  held  until  this
moment.

Mr Mushwana reflects  much  of  the  essential  character  of  the  National
Council  of  Provinces.  As  Deputy  Chairperson,  he   has   executed   his
responsibilities with dedication and integrity.  He  has  lived  up  to  the
expectations of all the members of the Council as both an  impartial  and  a
firm Deputy Chairperson. He has also earned  enormous  respect  as  the  co-
chair of the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests. We also  know
that Mr Mushwana has acquitted himself  well  as  a  representative  of  the
National Council of Provinces and Parliament in international fora  as  well
as  international  parliamentary  bodies.  Furthermore,  he  has  played  an
important role  in  important  institutions  in  our  country  such  as  the
Judicial Services Commission.

It is, therefore, as Shakespeare wrote, ``with sweet sorrow'', that we  take
our leave of him today. Sweet in that we rejoice in his  appointment  to  an
important office in our country; sorrow  in  that  we  are  sad  to  lose  a
colleague who has played such a vital role in this institution. I know  that
I am not, Deputy Chairperson, your Juliet, and neither are you my  Romeo.  I
am not sitting on a balcony proclaiming this message of  farewell.  However,
I am sitting in what we could class as a balcony while we have  you  on  the
floor. It is indeed sweet sorrow. We wish you well.

We believe that the opportunity you  have  been  given  will  be  a  further
advance in both your career and  our  overall  constitutional  prescript  of
ensuring that  we  achieve  representivity,  equality  and  justice  in  our
country. And we know that you will acquit yourself well in  advancing  these
objectives and principles. You have chosen to give life  to  the  intentions
of our world-class Constitution and it is our  view  that  you  will  indeed
carry out your mandate with resolve and in the  excellent  manner  in  which
you have played your role in the NCOP.

Famba kahle  tatana  Mushwana.  Ha  swi  tiva  leswaku  ntirho  lowu  wu  ku
fanerile. [Farewell, Mr Mushwana. We know you are the right person  for  the
job.]

Ka Setswana ra re, ke wena ntate. O tsamaye sentle. [Legofi.]  [In  Setswana
we say, you are the father. Farewell. [Applause.]]

Order! Hon members and particularly hon Minister Manuel, before  we  proceed
to the first Order I would like  to  give  members  from  the  provinces  an
opportunity briefly to bid farewell to the hon Mr Mushwana.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, you are quite  correct  in  that
we are not at all surprised at the nomination of Mr Mushwana as  the  Public
Protector, but at the same time extremely disappointed  that  his  departure
will leave a vacuum in this institution. I am not going to repeat  the  very
eloquent and comprehensive details of his contribution to  this  institution
other than to say that in addition to what you have raised, he  also  served
the Judicial Services Commission very ably in that particular  capacity  and
his legal background has held him in good stead. We also  believe  that  his
experience in this institution will hold him  in  good  stead  in  the  very
important public and constitutional function that he is going to perform.

I have known Mr Mushwana from the time that we started out here as  senators
in 1994 and our relationship was an absolutely wonderful one. I  would  like
to speak a little bit about his personal traits  -  his  ability  to  engage
with all members in a very friendly, amicable, respectful and dignified  way
irrespective of  the  party  affiliation  of  that  particular  member.  His
impartiality,  his  integrity,  his  honesty   and   his   commitment   have
contributed to enhancing the image of this  institution.  We  can  only  but
wish Mr Mushwana well and we are confident that he will perform  this  very,
very important role with the same excellence with which he has  served  this
particular institution.

On behalf of the NCOP and Parliament  as  a  whole  we  would  like  to  say
farewell, good friend. We believe that you are going  to  serve  the  nation
well. [Applause.]

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, as representatives from  the  Eastern  Cape  we
wish to say that we appreciate the fact that we have been with  Mr  Mushwana
in this Parliament ever since we came here. We were together  when  we  came
here, we were together when we were lost in the streets of Cape Town and  at
the airport, and up to today we are still together. Now we are  wishing  him
good luck and a good time where he is going to work.

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, I would like to say that Mr  Mushwana's  going
away to be the Public Protector is a credit to this House and when I say  it
is a credit to this House I mean that it is a credit to all 54 of us  seated
here and to me in particular in relation to the guidance you  gave  me  from
June 1999 and with particular regard to  your  words  when  you  said:  ``If
there is a budget people have to stick to the budget. You  do  not  have  to
buy a stamp and say `approved'  even  when  you  know  that  that  thing  is
outside the budget''. Throughout my career and even when  I  am  retired,  I
will always think of that and even use it within my own  household  to  say:
``If there is so much, my children, we cannot go beyond that''.  With  those
words, on behalf of all the people of the  Free  State,  in  particular  the
legislature, fare thee well. [Applause.]

Ms J L KGOALI: Madam Chairperson, on behalf of the Gauteng province we  want
to welcome the hon Public  Protector  into  our  province.  It  is  a  smart
province that will always take care of you as this House has done in  recent
years. We have enjoyed being with you in this House. It is sad to lose  you,
but we are happy that you are  now  going  to  lead  one  of  the  important
institutions that is going to enhance our democracy.

Re re ho wena, o bile mohale ka hare ho Ntlo ena  ya  rona  ya  Lebatowa  la

follows.)

[We say to you: You have been a hero in this National Council of  Provinces.
We say: Go well, may life be kind to you at all  times.  We  will  still  be
with you, and you with us, all the time.  We  wish  you  everything  of  the
best. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, Mr Mushwana  is  indeed  a  true  leader  who
possesses all the qualities of a good leader. He will be missed  by  all  of
us.

Egameni  lesifundazwe  saKwaZulu-Natali  nasegameni  leqembu   lami   i-IFP,
ngithi: Ndlela nhle! Lapho  eya  khona  angashintshi.  Uma  engashintshanga,
uyofundisa abaningi ukuthi ukuhola kuyinto enjani. Siyabonga  kakhulu  ngoba
usiphathe  kahle  sonke.  Akazange  athi  mhlawumbe  ngoba   lowaya   akekho
esibayeni wabe esemphatha ngokwehlukile, kepha usiphathe sonke  ngokufanayo.
(Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[On behalf of KwaZulu-Natal and my party, the IFP, I want to say:  Go  well!
He must not behave differently where he is going.  If  he  does  not  behave
differently, he will teach many people about the way that leadership  should
be. We are very grateful that he treated us  well.  He  never  discriminated
against people from different political parties. He treated all  of  us  the
same.]

He is a wonderful leader. He should keep it up. [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, as representatives of Mpumalanga we want  to  join
the rest of the provinces in congratulating the hon Mushwana  on  this  very
important  appointment.  We  are  speaking  on  behalf  of  the  people   of
Mpumalanga and we know that we are not  misrepresenting  them  when  we  say
that he has served the nation with distinction. We  have  no  doubt  in  our
minds that wherever he is going he has only one thing in  mind,  ie  service
to the people. We know that he will not disappoint us. He will serve  us  as
he did in this NCOP. [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I am short of words, but the little I have  to
say will carry a lot of weight. May I also join the rest  of  my  colleagues
in congratulating Mr  Mushwana  on  his  new  appointment.  We  have  worked
together since 1994 and he had become part of my family. Whenever I had  any
problems, I would go to him and he would listen.

I thank him for those qualities. I thank him for his  down-to-earth  nature.
I thank him for leading us. I thank him for being  with  somebody  like  Mrs
Pandor - they made a wonderful team. I am sorry that he is  leaving,  but  I
am also glad that he will be helping us on the other side. I must  tell  him
I already have a couple of cases for him. [Laughter.]

All I can say from  the  Northern  Cape  and  the  delegates:  We  wish  him
prosperity. We wish him the best of luck and we trust  that  he  will  treat
everybody the way he has treated us in this House.

Tsamaya ka kgotso, mahlohonolo ohle a be le wena. [Mahofi.]  [Go  well,  and
we wish you everything of the best. [Applause.]]

[Mrs C NKUNA: Thank  you,  Chairperson.  To  the  hon  Mr  Mushwana,  it  is
regarded as of very great significance and is appreciated when people  meet.
It is very sad to say farewell. You have heard what the Chairperson said  in
English, when she said: ``It is sweet sorrow.'' In the House as a  whole  Mr
Mushwana is one of the ANC members of whom we are very proud. We  are  proud
of him and even in the past we were very proud of him.

We appreciate his  presence  in  our  Government.  We  also  appreciate  his
presence  where  he  is  going.  We  are  very  grateful  for  his   various
activities. He is humble and not proud. He is always working,  serving  this
Government. On behalf of the Limpopo Province, we feel very sad, but on  the
other hand we feel gratified. We would like to  say  to  you,  brother,  our
son, our comrade, may prosperity be with you. [Applause.]]
Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I have the honour, on  behalf  of  my  provincial
delegation and my provincial  legislature  to  thank  Mr  Mushwana  for  the
positive role he has played in this House and also for his positive role  in
promoting this House, I must say. I on a personal level,  wish  Mr  Mushwana
nothing but the best and on a personal level every member of  my  delegation
and the provincial legislature wishes him all the best.  He  has  shown  the
ability to grow in the position he  holds  at  present  and  we  have  every
expectation he will grow further and serve his nation in his  new  position.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, it is my honour and pleasure on  behalf  of  our
delegation  to  thank  Mr  Mushwana  for  his   good   services,   kindness,
impartiality and friendship that he has displayed during the  time  that  he
has been here. The attributes he displayed here and the success of his  work
here, of course, played a great role in his elevation to this  high  office,
and so we congratulate him and wish him well.

Much has been said about his attributes, but I would like to  say  something
briefly about his qualities. The qualities of the  man  are  wonderful  -  I
mean his kindness, his gentleness, his firmness,  his  fairness.  These  are
qualities that we have all experienced and enjoyed. His  diplomacy  is  also
something which has been very much appreciated. We wish him  very  well.  We
wish Mrs Mushwana very well and we know that he will  go  on  to  perform  a
great service for our country. Very best wishes. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Mev die Voorsitter,  dit  is  vir  my  'n  vreugde  om  van
hierdie geleentheid gebruik te maak om mnr Mushwana van harte geluk te  wens
met sy aanstelling as Openbare Beskermer. Hy  is  sonder  twyfel  die  beste
persoon vir hierdie posisie. Ons het die geleentheid gehad om  mnr  Mushwana
oor  'n  lang  tydperk  baie  goed  te  leer  ken.  Hy  het  te   alle   tye
onbevooroordeeld en met regverdigheid opgetree in  al  die  menige  posisies
waarin hy gedien het.

Ons het hom leer ken as 'n persoon met onkreukbare  integriteit,  en  as  'n
baie bekwame regsgeleerde wat 'n fyn aanvoeling vir die reg het. Hy  het  'n
praktiese, oplossingsgerigte benadering tot alle probleme. Ons het  ook  die
mens Lawrence Mushwana goed geleer ken, ook in ander hoedanighede as net  in
die amptelike hoedanighede waarin hy gedien het. Ons het hom leer ken as  'n
goeie en 'n opregte vriend  met  'n  deernis  en  'n  groot  warmte  vir  sy
medemens en sy medekollegas.

Ons beste wense vergesel hom met die nuwe uitdagings en  verantwoordelikhede
wat vir hom wag in sy nuwe pos, wat sekerlik een van die  verantwoordelikste
posisies in ons land is. Ons weet hy is die regte  persoon.  Ons  het  volle
vertroue in hom, en ons sien ook uit daarna om in die toekoms weer  met  hom
saam te werk. Ons beste wense. [Applous.] (Translation of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Madam  Chair,  it  is  a  pleasure  for  me  to  take  this
opportunity to congratulate Mr Mushwana most sincerely  on  his  appointment
as Public Protector. He is undoubtedly the best person  for  this  position.
We have had the opportunity of getting to know Mr Mushwana very well over  a
long period of time. He was impartial at all times and acted fairly  in  all
the many positions in which he served.

We got to know him as a person with  impeccable  integrity  and  as  a  very
competent  lawyer  with  a  well-developed  legal  sensitivity.  He  has   a
practical, solution-based approach to all problems. We also got to know  the
person Lawrence Mushwana very well, including in capacities other  than  the
official one in which he served. We got to know him as a  good  and  sincere
friend with compassion and great warmth for his fellow human beings and  his
colleagues.

Our best wishes accompany him in the  new  challenges  and  responsibilities
that await him in his new  post,  which  is  undoubtedly  one  of  the  most
responsible positions in our country. We know he is  the  right  person.  We
have complete confidence in him and we also look  forward  to  working  with
him in future. Our best wishes. [Applause.]]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, the DP notes with regret that this is the  swansong
appearance of our Deputy Chair, Mr Lawrence  Mushwana,  in  this  House,  as
well as the end of his career as an MP. And I want to emphasise  today  that
he must realise that one of the few parties and one of the  most  vociferous
ones who voted to keep him here was the DP while all of the rest  voted  for
him to go. [Laughter.]

We have always found him to be a unifying force in this House, dealing  very
fairly with all disputes and I  hope  that  he  will  take  this  particular
quality and employ it to its fullest in his new office as Public  Protector,
and that he will do so in all the many languages which he is master  of.  We
wish him everything of the best. Go well! [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, it is quite difficult for me to talk  about  Mr
Mushwana because I have been living  with  him  and  working  with  him  for
almost 15 years in the public sector. Perhaps I  am  the  person  who  knows
Mushwana best. We have had  fun  together  and  we  have  worked  very  hard
together. It has always been the case with Mr Mushwana, especially  when  it
comes to the relationship between me and him,  that  he  gets  promoted  and
leaves us. I am not surprised today that he is leaving this House.

But, coming back to the UDM position, I went to him the day I heard that  he
would be leaving us, because he is my brother. I asked: `` Are  you  hearing
the call once more?'' He replied: ``We will see, but the President  has  not
approved it.'' He said to me: ``Ron, you know, I am blessed because I  heard
that Bantu Holomisa was very pleased about my achievement. I did not  expect
him really to be agreeable to this promotion.''  That  in  itself  underpins
the position of the UDM.

Furthermore, in our caucus we discussed this. We wanted to seek the  opinion
of the members there and there was unanimous jubilation and acceptance  that
Mr Mushwana would take over this position. I think we  also  registered  our
stance  in  the  National  Assembly  through  one  of  our  members   there.
Otherwise, all in all we are going to  miss  this  gentleman.  I  know  him.
However, at the same time we are not going to miss him, because he is  still
going to help South Africans, perhaps on a higher level. We  wish  him  good
luck in his new career. [Applause.]

Mr M L MUSHWANA: Chairperson, I am  even  losing  weight.  I  am  trying  to
rearrange my trousers. I did not believe that it would  come  to  the  stage
when I must bid you farewell.

One of my closest friends telephoned me one day after the National  Assembly
committee recommended in the National Assembly that I  be  appointed  Public
Protector. He woke up in the morning and switched  on  the  radio  and  what
came out of the radio was: ``Who is Laurence Mushwana?'' This  person  said:
``I was shocked, because that was the question''. The presenter went  on  to
say they would have to look for those who knew who Laurence Mushwana was  to
explain to them. So he said: ``I was shocked  because  this  thing  normally
happens when somebody has died. It took me a long time.  I  was  rigid  with
shock until this person began  to  speak  about  your  achievements''.  This
person was now telephoning me to make sure he was hearing the right thing.

I am saying this because having to respond to the  sentiments  expressed  by
hon members in this House is difficult for me. Listening  to  them  is  like
listening to one's own obituary, which  is  very  unusual.  One  listens  to
people talk about oneself and one wonders  whether  they  are  saying  these
good things because this time the obituary is being read in one's  presence.
They do  not  want  to  say  bad  things  because  one  sees  them.  I  must
immediately thank  you,  Chairperson,  for  allowing  this  opportunity  hon
members to express their views.

I know we have very limited time and I therefore stand up here to make  sure
that I shed all the powers of an  MP  because  after  this  speech  all  the
powers of an MP will be gone. I am also standing here to assume a new  title
and new powers which I have never had before and from now onwards and  maybe
for the next year or the next seven years I will  be  known  as  the  Public
Protector. At the same time I stand here to start another chapter  in  which
we will live by sentiments. I will, at times, have to think  about  you  and
the good old days, because we will no longer be meeting here  sharing  these
experiences.

When the hon member Nogumla  was  talking  about  us  getting  lost  at  the
airport it reminded me that when I was first sworn in in this House,  I  had
not washed. [Laughter.] We were sent to the airport and told the planes  had
been arranged, but when we got there there was no plane.  We  slept  at  the
airport. We came here the following day  and  when  we  were  taken  to  the
hotel, just as we entered the hotel, we were told it was time  to  be  sworn
in. And when we wanted to go and wash, Mrs Tambo  said  to  us:  ``Comrades,
you know how to wash. Why do you worry about washing? Leave  your  bags  and
go to the Chamber.'' And we just left our bags and came into  this  Chamber.
So I confirm that when  I  was  being  sworn  in  here  I  had  not  washed.
[Laughter.]

Let me also take this opportunity to thank the hon  members  for  their  co-
operation. I found them to be a  co-operative  team.  I  found  them  to  be
supporting one another and I trust that this spirit will continue. Maybe  if
they were not co-operative, I would not be where I  am,  because  I  do  not
believe I achieved this single-handedly, but instead it comes to me  because
of their support and assistance.

I have listened to the members' opinions and those opinions I got  from  hon
members helped to build me, and I am very proud to have this opportunity  of
telling hon members that I am leaving them with a happy smile. If,  for  any
reason whatsoever, I have crossed swords with  any  hon  member,  I  do  not
think it was personal, but for the good of what  brought  us  together  here
and therefore I am leaving hon members with a happy  smile.  It  is  painful
for me to part with hon members though, but we all knew that we  would  have
to part one day.

When I look at this Chamber, I think back to the time when we  started  out.
I think of Kobie Coetsee, the first President of the Senate, I think of  the
late Oom Gov, who was the Deputy President of the Senate,  I  think  of  the
late Sefora, who was a veteran  in  this  House,  and  I  think  of  Comrade
Mchunu, who was the Chairperson of Committees from whom I took over when  he
passed away, so I have very sad memories and  also  very  fond  memories  of
this Chamber. It is painful to part, but we must part.

In order to promote this democracy we need to occupy different  trenches.  I
am with hon members, fighting for the same cause. If  I  were  in  the  ANC,
which I will dearly miss from  now  onwards,  I  would  have  said  we  were
fighting together for the national democratic revolution!  In  other  words,
we are fighting that our people at grassroots level must also be served.

Therefore this task, as hon members have correctly stated, is a  challenging
one. It is daunting, but it must be done. Somebody must do  it.  Finally,  I
thank the National Assembly committee. I thank  the  National  Assembly  for
their decision that I be recommended. I also thank  the  President  of  this
country  for  the  confidence  he  has  shown  in  me   by   accepting   the
recommendation of the National Assembly and appointing me  in  the  position
of Public Protector. I am ready to face the challenge. Obviously I need  the
support of everybody. I know with hon members' support I will succeed.

In the end I would be wrong if I  did  not  thank  my  wife,  who  has  been
supportive throughout the difficult days. I know at times I was not at  home
during the struggle. She would not know where I was and then  I  would  just
appear. She has been supportive up to now and I think I must thank her  very
much for her support. Once again I thank hon members. [Applause.]

                 COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT SCHEMES CONTROL BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam  Chairperson,  hon  members,  the  Collective
Investment Schemes Control Bill, or the CIS Bill  as  it  is  known  in  the
industry, has been a long time in the making. It is a very  necessary  piece
of legislation, especially in an environment where, from time  to  time,  we
read  these  wretched  stories  of  pyramid  schemes  and  how   unprotected
investments go down the chute, leaving the poor often even so much poorer.

The legislation has been a long time in the making.  It  is  instructive  to
note that when  the  Select  Committee  on  Finance  was  dealing  with  the
legislation, there was not a single submission from the  industry.  That  is
because, we would like to believe, the  process  that  brought  us  to  this
point has actually involved all of the industry players - large  and  small,
black and white - in order to ensure that we can have the  legislation  that
effectively  offers  protection  to  the  2,5  million  unit  trust  account
holders. These mutual kinds of  funds  are  the  largest  single  source  of
investment for many working people in this country and it is important  that
this legislation provides the kind of protection that it seeks.

There are two broad areas of  protection.  The  first  relates  to  investor
protection that, firstly, will provide for a separation between manager  and
custodian, and secondly, will fulfil the need for much  stronger  disclosure
rules. The second  kind  of  protection  arises  in  respect  of  prudential
regulations, and three kinds of regulations are included in  the  Bill.  The
first regulation specifies the steps that need  to  be  taken  when  a  part
owner sells out of  the  scheme.  The  second  regulation  pertains  to  the
capital adequacy  ratios  of  those  listed  and  licensed  to  conduct  the
business of unit  trust  management,  and  the  third  regulation  places  a
limitation on the types of investment.

As I said earlier, this legislation has been a long time in the making,  and
I have much pleasure in placing the Bill before  this  House  for  adoption.
[Applause].

Dr E A CONROY: Mevrou die Voorsitter, minister Manuel en  kollegas,  hierdie
wetsontwerp maak voorsiening vir 'n omvattende wetgewende raamwerk  wat  die
kollektiewe beleggingsbedryf volgens internasionaal aanvaarde  beginsels  en
beste praktyk sal beheer en reguleer.

'n Kollektiewe beleggingskema is 'n  skema  wat  beleggers  wat  soortgelyke
beleggingsdoeleindes in gedagte het, in staat stel om hul fondse te  verpoel
in 'n enkele portefeulje van sekuriteite, eiendomme  of  deelnemingsverbande
wat deur professionele bestuurders geadministreer word. Aangesien  beleggers
in  die  skema  nie  die  onderliggende  bates  direk  aankoop   nie,   word
eienaarskap in kleiner eenhede van deelnemende belang verdeel.

Die wetsontwerp maak dus ook voorsiening vir moderne wetgewing  ten  opsigte
van eiendoms- en gewone eenheidstrusts, asook  deelnemingsverbande,  wat  'n
belangrike deel van besparingsmiddels in Suid-Afrika  uitmaak.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Madam Chair,  Minister  Manuel  and  colleagues,  this  Bill
provides  for  a  comprehensive  legal  framework  which  will  control  and
regulate   the   collective   investment   industry   in   accordance   with
internationally accepted principles and best practice.

A  collective  investment  scheme  is  a  scheme  that   enables   investors
contemplating similar investment objectives to pool their funds in a  single
portfolio  of  securities,  properties  or  participation   mortgage   bonds
administered by professional managers. Since investors in the scheme do  not
purchase the underlying assets directly, ownership is divided  into  smaller
units of participatory interest.

The Bill therefore also provides  for  modern  legislation  with  regard  to
property unit trusts and ordinary unit  trusts,  as  well  as  participation
mortgage bonds, which represent an important part  of  savings  vehicles  in
South Africa.]

Unit trusts had their origins in the United  Kingdom  in  the  19th  century
when funds had to be raised for the British  colonial  government.  Although
South  African  legislation  concerning  the   unit   trust   industry   was
promulgated as early as 1947,  the  first  unit  trusts  were  launched  and
actually took off almost a hundred years later than they did in Britain,  in
1965.
Stokvels, however, which we all know and which have a long  history  in  the
South African culture, can be identified as the first  forms  of  collective
investment in this country. Today the bulk of collective  investment  scheme
funds in South Africa are managed by three or  four  large  companies  which
are either insurance companies  or  banks,  the  total  assets  under  their
control being in the order of R176 billion.

It is therefore understandable that it  has  become  urgently  necessary  to
regulate all forms of collective investment schemes  by  one  Act  which  is
precisely what this Bill is all about. In a nutshell, it  provides  for  the
control, regulation  and  supervision  of  all  investment-based  collective
investment schemes, including unit  trust  schemes  and  foreign  collective
investment schemes which want to carry on business in South Africa.

The benefits of this legislation, as  proposed  by  the  Financial  Services
Board and the Association of Unit Trusts of South Africa,  are  obvious  and
include,  inter  alia,  the  preservation  of  our  industry's   competitive
position, the stemming and reversal of investment,  employment  and  revenue
losses,  and  the  enhancement  of  regulation,  supervision  and   investor
protection, as it sets the ground  rules  for  investment  managers  to  act
honestly and fairly with skill, care and diligence.

The introduction of the registrar's ability to declare certain practices  or
methods of administration to be undesirable,  and  sections  which  prohibit
false or misleading statements which may fraudulently  induce  a  person  to
invest, are outstanding aspects of this legislation which are long overdue.

The fact that this legislation is the end product of opinion surveys in  the
industry, the review of existing legislation and workshops on the  topic  by
the Association of Unit Trusts, which indicated a serious and urgent  desire
of the participants in the industry to present  an  honest  and  trustworthy
product and service to South Africa's investment community, is commendable.

The New NP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, the Bill has undergone a very long  consultative
process and we have learned that this department is  extremely  thorough  in
its preparation. We have experienced that all the time. We thank  them  also
for this good piece of legislation.

One of the major features of the Bill, of  course,  is  enhanced  disclosure
requirements for investors. I think that is vitally important. The heart  of
the Bill, as my colleague  has  just  pointed  out,  is  that  a  collective
investment  scheme  must  act  honestly,  fairly,  with  skill,   care   and
diligence. That is the heart of the Bill.

But the Bill is effectively not financial legislation. In  a  sense,  it  is
consumer legislation. We wonder  whether  the  provincial  consumer  courts,
like we now have in the Cape, could  perhaps  even  hear  cases  when  small
investors cost-effectively wish to enquire or feel that they have a  problem
with their investment. I think  if  one  looks  at  the  whole  question  of
investment, we want to encourage smaller investors also to accumulate  their
savings. As an added  protection  we  have  these  consumer  courts  in  our
provinces. Possibly,  since  this  is  consumer  legislation,  the  consumer
courts might play a role for the public.

The  public  is  also  protected  by  a  host  of  provisions,  constraints,
requirements,  punishment  of   contraventions   and   criminal   sanctions.
Personally, I like clause 94 which does away with the ``buy-sell''  pricing.
I like that the net asset value will be given and maximum  additional  costs
will be shown separately. I think this simplification will  make  it  easier
for investors.

There are many improvements, such as the ability to borrow  funds,  and  the
pooling provisions for participation  bonds,  which  will  spread  risk  and
reduce risk for investments using that kind  of  instrument.  That  is  very
good.

I also like  the  fact  that,  although  the  FSB  will  be  the  regulating
authority, after very long negotiation the Bill makes  ample  provision  for
self-regulation  through  recognition  of  industry  associations  as  self-
regulatory bodies. That is cost-effective and  in  line  with  international
best practice. I think it looks somewhat like a hybrid between what the  SCC
does and what the British do. But I think this probably  contains  the  best
of those two worlds. We have always been at the forefront of  this  kind  of
thing ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am afraid your time has expired.
Mr K D S DURR: Two minutes are a very short time, Chairperson. [Laughter.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, Minister and hon  members,  essentially  the  Bill
before  this  House  provides  a  comprehensive  legislative  framework   to
regulate and supervise the collective investment schemes industry  based  on
internationally accepted principles and best practice.

This begs the question: What is a collective investment  scheme?  Collective
investment schemes allow investors with similar  objectives  to  pool  their
funds for investment in a single  portfolio  of  securities,  properties  or
participation bonds that will  be  administered  by  professional  managers.
Ownership  of  the  assets  is  divided  into  units   of   entitlement   of
participatory interest. The return on the investment is usually in the  form
of dividends and capital  appreciation  derived  from  the  pool  of  assets
underlying the fund.

Originally collective  investment  schemes  were  popularly  known  as  unit
trusts. Unit trusts were  first  launched  in  South  Africa  in  1965.  The
industry grew in the late 1960s. Subsequently, the 1969 crash of  the  stock
exchange produced a decade of bear markets which only recovered in the  late
1970s.  Since  the  mid-nineties  the  unit   trust   industry   has   grown
substantially.

Collective investment schemes in South Africa, however, have a long  history
in our culture through the proliferation  of  stokvels.  Stokvels,  however,
are  not  within  the  ambit  of  this  Bill  because   they   are   private
arrangements. Stokvels, it must be borne in mind, have promoted the  concept
of collective savings for many years.

The Bill currently before this House  covers  four  types  of  institutional
schemes: First, schemes  in  securities;  second,  foreign  schemes;  third,
schemes  in  property;  and  fourth,  schemes  in  participation  bonds.  In
addition, clauses 62 to 64 of the Bill enable the  Minister  of  Finance  to
declare  certain  other  types  of  business  to  be  collective  investment
schemes, thereby bringing them into the  regulatory  net.  The  Minister  of
Finance may, by notice in the Gazette, declare a specific type  of  business
to be a collective investment scheme. This enables the  Minister  to  define
the activity and set regulations, and specify matters that must be  included
in the deed of the declared collective investment scheme.
Clause 22 of the Bill allows the registrar to exempt a scheme from the  Bill
when it is in the public interest to do so. The registrar  may  also  refuse
to register a scheme.

Revised legislation in respect of collective investment  has  been  prompted
for the following reasons. Firstly, rural industry  was  at  a  disadvantage
because of  foreign  competition.  Secondly,  the  policy  division  of  the
Financial Services Board is  of  the  view  that  all  forms  of  collective
investment schemes should be included in one piece of legislation.  Thirdly,
there is an urgent need to upgrade  disclosure  requirements  to  investors.
Fourthly, revised legislation gives the  registrar  greater  powers  to  act
against noncompliance.

Work on this Bill really commenced in  1997,  with  a  survey  by  the  firm
Deloitte and Touche. Hon members of this House must please  note  that  this
Bill is a product of extensive consultation, attendance of  conferences  and
workshops over a period of five years with affected stakeholders. When  this
Bill came before the parliamentary committee, much work  and  thinking  were
done.  Rethinking  and  redrafting  have  taken  place  among  the  affected
stakeholders. No member of the public made submissions  on  this  Bill,  and
our colleagues in the National Assembly made only a few amendments.

This Bill is a model example of consultation in our  robust  democracy,  and
it serves as an example of how Bills should  be  tabled  before  Parliament.
The ANC supports this section 75 Bill, and  congratulates  participants  and
stakeholders  for  executing  their   responsibilities   with   distinction.
[Applause.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, Minister and colleagues, because the  objectives
of  the  Bill  are  to  enhance   industry   competitiveness   and   attract
investments, it is recommended that the DP and the DA support the Bill.

The proverbial winds of change are clearly  blowing  through  the  financial
services sector. In this context of change and concomitant  uncertainty  the
DP calls on the Minister of Finance to ensure that  he  keeps  up  a  strong
dialogue process with all financial services stakeholders in  compiling  and
piloting any envisaged empowerment charter for this crucial  sector  of  our
economy.

The  CISC  Bill  seeks  to  regulate  and  control  the  establishment   and
administration  of  collective  investment  schemes,  or  unit  trusts,  and
provide for CISs to take the legal form of  either  a  trust  or  a  company
along the lines of similar provisions in the UK and the US. The  Association
of Property Unit Trusts and the Association  of  Unit  Trust  Companies  had
attended all committee deliberations  on  the  Bill  and  the  Bill  is  the
culmination of a long arduous  process  of  consultation  between  the  unit
trust industry and the Financial Services Board.

The Bill differentiates between four types of collective  schemes:  CISs  in
securities, CISs in property,  CISs  in  participation  mortgage  bonds  and
foreign CISs. In addition, the Bill allows the Minister of Finance to  bring
other types of collective investment schemes into the regulatory net by  way
of declaration. These will then become the so-called ``declared'' CISs.

The Registrar  of  the  Financial  Services  Board  obtains  new  powers  in
accordance with the Bill to regulate the  CISs.  New  regulatory  provisions
dealing with capital requirements, disclosure and  the  responsibilities  of
trustees or custodians of CISs should  ensure  greater  levels  of  investor
protection. While the Bill opens the door to hedge funds to operate  in  the
South African market, the Financial Services Board has given  the  Portfolio
Committee on Finance the  reassurance  that  hedge  funds  will  be  soundly
regulated.

One of the most important reasons for the existence of the new  Bill  is  to
enhance industry competitiveness and attract investment. As things stand  at
present, South African institutions are not  able  to  offer  the  range  of
collective investment schemes available in other countries,  simply  because
there is no existing legislation which governs their use. A  case  in  point
is the open-ended investment companies, OEIC, an alternative to unit  trusts
that have been highly successful in UK and other jurisdictions.

Our ability to attract investors - both foreign and  local  -  is  in  large
measure a function of the diversity or availability of  investment  options.
Familiarity  or,   at   least,   comparability   is   obviously   paramount,
particularly to investors from outside South Africa.

Amongst various benefits, the CISS Bill will allow for the  introduction  of
other investment products such as open-ended investment companies and  hedge
funds. The Bill,  therefore,  seeks  to  open  up  the  industry  to  global
competition with a broader  definition  of  collective  investment  schemes.
Hedge funds and other leveraged funds will have increased scope  to  operate
in South Africa subject to stringent  conditions  satisfying  the  Financial
Services Board that such funds can be  responsibly  marketed,  conveying  to
investors both the risks involved  and  the  strategies  used  in  order  to
enable the investor to make a sound choice based on his or her appetite  for
risk.

In addition, the Bill contains provisions for enhanced financial  disclosure
and improved protection clauses for investors.  Regulation  and  supervision
of the industry will also be improved, while the option and continued  scope
for creating a self-regulatory environment is retained in the Bill.

It is recommended that the DP and the DA support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues, the Bill before  this
House is unique because it introduces legislative measures  to  ensure  that
the industry of collective investment schemes remains financially sound.

Moreover, the Bill must be viewed against the  background  of  a  number  of
changes within the financial sector. The NCOP recently passed the  Financial
Advisory and Intermediary Services Bill.  The  symbolic  links  between  the
Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services  Bill,  now  an  Act,  and  the
Collective Investment Schemes Control Bill enhances  the  soundness  of  the
financial services sector. The Financial Advisory and Intermediary  Services
Act ensures greater protection for unit trusts, other collective  investment
schemes and investors who engage with intermediaries for financial  services
advice.

A major innovation of the Collective  Investment  Schemes  Control  Bill  is
that it advocates the promotion of  the  separation  of  the  manager  of  a
scheme from the trustee or custodian of a collective investment  scheme.  An
investment manager cannot unilaterally take control of investors'  funds  in
schemes. All transactions undertaken by a manager on behalf of investors  of
a collective  investment  scheme  must  be  authorised  by  a  trustee.  The
relationship between a custodian and a manager and the responsibilities  are
unambigiously set out in the Bill.

The investment manager or an investment company makes  investment  decisions
compatible with a trust deed which stipulates the kind of  investment  which
investors should invest in. The trust deed is drawn up jointly  between  the
board of trustees and the  management  company.  The  trustee  exercises  an
oversight function while an investment company invests money.

The Bill also hopes to make  collective  investment  schemes  accessible  to
ordinary citizens as a vehicle to boost levels of savings  in  the  country.
The Bill stimulates our new-found culture of encouraging  savings  in  South
Africa.

Clause 8 of the Bill creates an advisory committee on collective  investment
schemes. The advisory committee consists of the  chairperson  and  at  least
nine other members appointed by the Minister.

Part 11 of the Bill details the functions of  the  registrar  of  collective
investment schemes. The executive officer and a deputy executive officer  of
the Financial Services Board are  the  registrar  and  deputy  registrar  of
collective investment schemes, respectively.

The special provision concerning the role of  the  registrar  of  collective
investment  schemes  is   noteworthy.   The   registrar   may   conduct   an
investigation  into  the  business  of  a  person,  whether  registered   or
authorised  in  terms  of  this  Bill  or  not,  who  is  involved  in   the
administration of a  collective  investment  scheme  or  the  soliciting  of
investment in a collective investment scheme.

If the registrar, after an investigation or inspection, considers  that  the
interests of the investors of a collective investment scheme so require,  he
or she may apply to  the  court  for  the  winding-up  of  a  manager  or  a
collective investment scheme, for a judicial management order, and  for  the
appointment of a  curator.  He  or  she  may  also  cancel  or  suspend  the
registration of an investment manager, institute penalties  for  failure  or
inability to comply with requirements, and direct  a  manager  to  have  all
books of accounts and financial statements audited and submit the result  of
such an audit to the registrar.

The ANC supports this section 75 Bill. [Applause.]
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and  hon  members,  may  I  express  my
appreciation to all the parties for their support for this legislation,  but
permit me to comment on a few of the interventions made.

The first is that there are certain kinds of activities in which it is  best
that consumer protection is offered at national level. Schedule  4A  of  the
Constitution clearly  makes  provision  for  consumer  protection  to  be  a
concurrent function. But I think that we should recognise that the kinds  of
organisations that we are talking about here, would tend to be  national  in
character and therefore we would need strong supervision. In my view  it  is
not  possible  to  compartmentalise   supervision   to   within   provincial
boundaries.

Secondly, one hears the enthusiasm of members for issues of  self-regulation
and for some of what we have  seen  in  respect  of  investment  in  a  boom
market. But, if truth be told, part of what we need to do  is  realise  that
strong supervision is necessary in  the  interest  of  consumer  protection.
This is why the emphasis on consumer protection is as strong  as  it  is  in
this legislation.

We have to counter-balance this  human  quality  called  greed.  I  want  to
inform the hon Theron that some of what we have seen in the  US  and  UK  is
not in our interest. If one looks at some of the investment  practices  with
the 41Ks, too many people in  those  countries  are  left  with  no  pension
today. This happens in an environment in which we believe  that  the  market
is all-powerful and capable  of  regulating  itself,  yet  it  is  not!  Our
responsibility is to provide the buffer; to provide the consumer  protection
to ensure that people can make informed choices.

The interaction between this legislation  and  the  Financial  Advisory  and
Intermediary Services Act, is about this issue.  The  FAIS  Act  allows  the
small investor particularly to make an informed  choice  and  this  ups  the
scale of consumer protection. I believe that we regulate  and  legislate  on
these matters because we understand collectively, regardless of the  parties
we come from, that we need to counteract that bad human quality that  is  so
focused on amassing wealth at the expense of other people.

Lastly, let me just say that in respect of the empowerment charter,  what  I
know of the charter is what  I  have  read  in  the  newspapers.  It  is  an
initiative entirely driven  by  the  private  sector.  They  have  indicated
informally that they will discuss it from time to time with  the  Government
but it is not a Government initiative. I want to  thank  members  for  their
support for this legislation.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                SOUTH AFRICAN REVENUE SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson  and  hon  members,  on  1  October  we
celebrated the fifth anniversary of the  establishment  of  the  SA  Revenue
Service, and what we have in the amending Bill is the result of  five  years
of intensive learning about the  transformation  of  an  organisation.  Very
important in the  foundation  legislation  is  the  creation  of  an  entity
defined as being outside the Public Service but within the norms  of  public
administration. It is a kind of entity not known quite  in  those  terms  in
the public sector  previously.  So,  the  seven  amendments  sought  in  the
legislation serving before this House reflect  that  kind  of  learning  and
some of them are consequential, resulting from amendments  to  other  pieces
of legislation or, in some cases, the introduction of new legislation.

The first of the amendments deals with the extension to include the  customs
function which, I think, seeks to regularise a de  facto  position,  because
the Revenue Service deals  with  customs.  The  second  amendment  seeks  to
effect an alignment between the  SA  Revenue  Service  Act  and  the  Public
Finance Management Act because Sars, as members who have  studied  the  Bill
know, is listed in Schedule 3 of the Public Finance Management Act.

The  third  amendment  alters  the  norms  for  the   appointment   of   the
commissioner. The principal Act has the  Minister  making  the  appointment,
but because of the nature of the task of the  commissioner  and  because  of
the fact that the  commissioner  has  so  extensive  a  discretionary  power
vested in him or her, we saw fit to amend that provision to ensure that  the
President makes the appointment.

The fourth amendment seeks to terminate the life of  the  Sars  board  which
was a unique kind of board, created to help us along the way. The board  has
served a very useful purpose under the chairmanship of Justice  Corbett  and
we have now been able to take leave of the individuals  who  served  on  the
board.

The fifth amendment creates  or  permits  the  establishment  of  specialist
committees and the legislation deals with committees that  will  look  after
functions such as human resources  and  information  technology.  The  sixth
amendment is highly innovative. It allows for Sars  to  be  funded  by  ways
other than the competitive bidding process and one of the rules allowed  for
is that Sars is funded on a percentage of collections in the previous  year.
It is not a decision that will be lightly taken  and  not  a  decision  that
will be taken without specific and explict discussions  in  Parliament,  but
the provision is being made in the SA  Revenue  Service  Act  to  deal  with
this.

The last amendment  seeks  to  deal  with  or  regularise  the  position  of
employees of Sars who may be contracted employees but are permitted to  join
the Government Employees Pension Fund. Hitherto they have been  specifically
excluded from joining the pension fund. Because the amending Bill before  us
is, as I said earlier, the result of five years of intense learning in  this
new entity, I have  much  pleasure  in  placing  it  before  the  House  for
consideration [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, the Bill before the  House,  as  the  Minister
has said, is very technical in nature, so I will try and just highlight  the
specific things that were of critical importance to the committee.

Chairperson, Minister and hon members of this august House, as the  Minister
has indicated, the Bill before us seeks to effect  amendments  to  the  Sars
legislation which was passed in 1997,  which,  amongst  other  things,  gave
administrative autonomy to Sars. The Sars Act  of  1997  therefore  provided
that Sars would no longer be part of the Public  Service,  as  the  Minister
has indicated, but would be subjected to the  basic  values  and  principles
governing  the  public  administration  outlined  in  section  195  of   the
Constitution and I am sure hon members will be familiar with that.

But also, I think one of the  reasons  why  Sars  was  given  an  autonomous
administration was because Sars needed to attract professionals  and  people
with high skills when one would not ordinarily attract  if  one  remunerated
them at a rate equal to what one would pay people in the Public Service.  So
I think it is quite important that,  as  a  committee,  we  supported  these
recommendations and we think that these amendments are  quite  important.  I
will not delve much into the other things.

On the appointment of the commissioner, regarding which the  Bill  seeks  to
suggest that the President must make the appointment, the  committee  raised
the point that in other nominations, such as those of the Public  Protector,
the Auditor-General and many others, Parliament does play a role  in  making
a recommendation to the President and then he  makes  that  appointment.  In
the committee a concern was raised that in  some  instances,  just  to  give
Parliament some role in appointing  these  individuals  to  these  important
positions, it is important that Parliament should be  considered  and  given
the opportunity to play a role in one way or another.

The last point which I want to deal with - because the Bill,  as  Isaid,  is
very technical, so there is not much to add to  what  the  Minister  said  -
deals with the funding of Sars. Currently, Sars is funded  as  part  of  the
National Treasury Vote and what is proposed in the Bill  is  that  there  is
going be a discussion between  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  Revenue
Services about other ways in  which  Sars  can  be  given  funds.  But  that
process would then be given approval by Cabinet when the agreement has  been
reached by the Minister and the Revenue Services. I would,  therefore,  like
to recommend to this House that it should support the Bill. Thank  you  very
much. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  colleagues,  when  the  SA
Revenue Service Act, Act No 34, was adopted in 1997, the aim was  to  create
an efficient and effective administration  of  revenue  collection  systems.
This  required  substantive  organisational  structuring  of   the   Revenue
Service, including the establishment of an advisory  board  to  advise  both
the commissioner and the Minister of Finance.

The  positive  results  of  this  process  are  clear  to  see.   Sars   has
consistently exceeded and collected more than its targeted revenue over  the
past few years.  In  this  context  any  steps  aimed  at  improving  and/or
removing  ambiguities  and  inconsistencies  in  the   legal   institutional
framework within which we  expect  an  efficient  and  accountable  Sars  to
function must  be  supported.  With  the  adoption  of  the  Public  Finance
Management  Act  in  1999  the  need  arose  to  align  the   accountability
arrangement in the Sars Act with those contained in the PFMA.

The Sars Amendment Bill broadens the objectives and  functions  of  Sars  to
include customs and excise, which  was  insufficiently  dealt  with  in  the
principal Act pertaining to Sars, viz Act 34 of 1997; aligns the  duties  of
the accounting officer of Sars - the commissioner - with the PFMA;  provides
for the commissioner to be  appointed  by  the  President  and  not  by  the
Minister of Finance; disestablishes the Sars  advisory  boards  and  creates
specialist committees by statute; creates an additional method of funding  -
a specific provision about which the DA raised  reservations;  provides  for
Sars employees' membership of the Government  Employees  Pension  Fund;  and
deletes obsolete provisions - some fall away owing  to  the  alignment  with
the PFMA while some ministerial discretion to  issue  policy  directives  to
Sars is also being done away with.

The Bill before us broadens the objectives  and  functions  of  Sars,  apart
from revenue collection, to adequately cover the  exercise  of  customs  and
excise  functions.  This  would  provide   greater   legal   certainty   and
accountability to Sars for the exercise of these functions.

The amendment of section 25 of the  principal  Act  contained  in  the  Bill
creates an enabling provision to allow  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the
Commissioner of Sars to agree to another way, above and beyond  the  current
estimates of expenditure provisions in the PFMA, of funding to be  provided,
subject to the approval of Cabinet. This broad enabling provision opens  the
door to a number of policy options for alternative sources of funding.  Such
measures could include allowing  the  Revenue  Service  to  retain  a  fixed
percentage of revenue collected to fund its operations as  agreed  with  the
Minister of Finance and approved by Cabinet.

While this is only one alternative it is certainly one  that  is  attractive
to both the National Treasury and Sars. Although there can be no doubt  that
Sars' considerable organisational re-engineering under the Siyakha 1 and  II
projects is a costly exercise it must as far as possible be  funded  by  the
estimates process and not by alternative processes.  The  DA  believes  that
even if such a controversial route is  chosen  it  could  still  be  pursued
through the normal estimates process. The DP  and  DA  once  again  want  to
congratulate Sars on their effective and efficient operation. We trust  that
this new Bill will strengthen their operation. It is  recommended  that  the
DP and the DA support the Bill. I thank you. [Laughter.]

Dr E A CONROY: Agb Voorsitter, geagte Minister van  Finansies  en  kollegas,
'n aantal faktore het sedert die  afkondiging  van  die  Wet  op  die  Suid-
Afrikaanse Inkomstediens in 1997 daartoe gelei dat die wysiging  van  sekere
bepalings daarvan oorweeg moes word. Een van  dié  faktore  is  die  Wet  op
Openbare  Finansiële  Bestuur  wat  in  1999  afgekondig  is  en   wat   die
rekenpligtigheid en verantwoordelikhede van liggame soos die SAID reël.

'n Aantal geïdentifiseerde praktiese probleme in die huidige  bepalings  van
die bestaande SAID-wet het ook aanleiding gegee tot  die  wysiging  van  die
wet. Wysigings wat verband hou met die SAID  se  funksies  en  oogmerke  met
betrekking tot doeaneadministrasie en wat die SAID  se  advisering  van  die
Minister van Handel en Nywerheid oor aangeleenthede ten opsigte van die  in-
en uitvoer asook die beweging en opslag van goedere reflekteer,  word  onder
andere aangebring.

Ek verwys kortliks na enkele wysigings wat  in  hierdie  wetsontwerp  vervat
word. Tans  word  die  kommissaris  van  die  SAID  deur  die  Minister  van
Finansies, ná beraadslaging met die  Kabinet  en  die  betrokke  adviesraad,
aangestel.  Die  bepalings  in  hierdie  opsig  word   gewysig   sodat   die
kommissaris in die toekoms deur die President aangestel word. Die  nodigheid
dat die  SAID  aan  die  Minister  van  Finansies  verslag  moet  doen,  het
ingevolge die Wet op Openbare Finansiële Bestuur verval en daarom  word  die
spesifieke bevoegdhede  van  die  Minister  van  Finansies,  waar  dit  deur
laasgenoemde wet gereël word, geskrap.

Die SAID se adviesraad, wat hoofsaaklik 'n adviserende funksie  het  en  nie
werklik by beleid of besluitneming betrokke is nie, word ontbind en  vervang
met 'n aantal spesialiskomitees wat die  Minister  en  die  kommissaris  oor
tegniese aangeleenthede adviseer. Tans moet die  SAID  die  goedkeuring  van
die Minister van Finansies  verkry  alvorens  die  diensvoorwaardes  van  sy
werknemers  bepaal  word.  Hierdie  bepaling   word   verander   sodat   die
kommissaris in sy hoedanigheid as hoof- uitvoerende  beampte  dié  terme  en
voorwaardes kan goedkeur, hoewel voldoende verslagdoening oor hierdie  aspek
deur die kommissaris aan die Minister vereis word.

Die bepaling van die SAID wat tot gevolg kan hê dat  'n  werknemer  van  die
sogenaamde ``Government Employees Pension Fund'' uitgesluit kan  word,  word
gewysig. Laastens word 'n wysiging aangebring waarvolgens  die  Minister  en
die kommissaris kan ooreenkom oor 'n wyse  van  bepaling  van  die  SAID  se
fondse, onderhewig aan die  goedkeuring  van  die  Kabinet.  Soos  ek  reeds
genoem het, het hierdie wysigings uit praktiese oorwegings nodig  geword  en
het dit geen finansiële implikasies vir die staat nie.

Die Nuwe NP steun hierdie  wetsontwerp.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister  of  Finance  and  colleagues,
since the enactment of the South African  Revenue  Service  Act  in  1997  a
number of factors have necessitated the consideration of  the  amendment  of
certain provisions. One of those factors is the  Public  Finance  Management
Act, which was enacted in 1999 and which regulates  the  accountability  and
responsibilities of bodies such as Sars.

A number of identified practical problems in the current provisions  of  the
existing Sars Act also gave rise to the amendment of the Act. Amendments  in
connection with the functions  and  objectives  of  Sars  regarding  customs
administration and that reflect the advice given by Sars to the Minister  of
Trade and Industry about matters in respect of  the  import  and  export  as
well as  the  movement  and  storage  of  goods,  among  others,  are  being
introduced.

I shall refer briefly to a few amendments that are contained in  this  Bill.
At present the commissioner of Sars is appointed by the Minister of  Finance
after consultation with Cabinet  and  the  relevant  advisory  council.  The
provisions  in  this  regard  are  being  amended  so  that  in  future  the
commissioner will be appointed by  the  President.  The  need  for  Sars  to
report to the Minister of Finance has fallen away in  terms  of  the  Public
Finance Management Act and therefore the specific powers of the Minister  of
Finance, as governed by the said Act, are being scrapped.

The advisory board of Sars, which primarily has  an  advisory  function  and
which is  not  really  involved  in  policy  or  decision-making,  is  being
dissolved and replaced with a number of  specialist  committees  which  will
advise the Minister and the commissioner on  technical  issues.  At  present
Sars has to obtain permission  from  the  Minister  of  Finance  before  the
conditions of service of its employees can be determined. This provision  is
being changed so that  the  commissioner  can,  in  his  capacity  as  chief
executive officer, approve these  terms  and  conditions  although  adequate
reporting on this aspect by the commissioner to the Minister is required.

The provision in the Sars Act  which  could  result  in  an  employee  being
excluded from the so-called  Government  Employees  Pension  Fund  is  being
amended. Finally, an amendment is being  affected  in  terms  of  which  the
Minister and the commissioner can agree  on  a  means  of  determining  Sars
funds, subject  to  Cabinet's  approval.  As  I  have  already  said,  these
amendments have become necessary for practical considerations  and  have  no
financial implications for the state.

The New NP supports this Bill.]
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, again let me  express  my
appreciation to all the parties for supporting the Sars Amendment  Bill.  If
I may, I should like to counsel caution regarding one of the  points  raised
in the report of the committee, namely the appointment of the  commissioner.
It is in my view exceedingly important  that  we  are  able  to  distinguish
between the appointment of individuals who fulfil functions  as  defined  in
Chapter 9 of  the  Constitution,  namely  those  who  head  up  those  state
institutions designed  to  support  democracy  on  the  one  hand,  and  the
appointment of heads of organisational parts of  the  state  system  on  the
other.

I do not think we are at the point where every  director-general  should  be
appointed by Parliament. I think that we may be  crossing  the  divide  that
separates an executive from a legislative  function.  So  really,  we  would
like to caution against an  idea  contained  in  the  comments  by  the  hon
Mahlangu, that we should give  consideration  to  this.  I  think  that  the
grounds are very clear. We are saying it is  an  important  appointment  and
that we should take it from the  Minister  to  the  President.  Clearly  the
President would be in consultation with the Minister  of  Finance  on  these
issues, but I would rather leave it there than seek to change  it  to  bring
this into line with the norms for Chapter  9  institutions.  Once  again  my
sincere appreciation. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

              NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I have been given to  understand  that
the Deputy Minister has apologised and  the  chairperson  of  the  committee
will introduce the Bill on her behalf.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson and hon members - do not be naughty  -  allow  me
to read the notes for briefing  to  be  given  by  the  Deputy  Minister  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism to the National Council  of  Provinces  on
31 October 2002. As a humble, honest servant allow me to read the speech.
In 1992 the Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  published  a  series  of
documents entitled the Integrated Environmental  Management  Procedure.  The
publication of these documents was widely publicised and they marked  a  new
watershed in  environmental  management  in  South  Africa.  The  Integrated
Environmental Management Procedure, or IEM, is designed to ensure  that  the
environmental consequences  of  development  proposals  are  understood  and
adequately considered.

Development proposals likely to  have  a  significant  environmental  impact
necessitate the carrying out of an environmental impact assessment in  terms
of IEM. In order to give legal effect to the IEM procedure the  Minister  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism identified activities which might  have  a
substantially detrimental effect on the environment, in terms of section  22
of the Environmental Conservation Act, Act 73 of 1989. These activities  are
listed in Government Notice No.R1182, Schedule 1 which  appears  in  Gazette
No 18261 of 5 September 1997.  Government  Notice  No  R1183  sets  out  the
responsibilities of an applicant wishing to undertake any of the  identified
activities. These responsibilities include an application for  authorisation
to undertake the activity concerned, the  submission  of  a  scoping  report
and, subject to the findings of the scoping report, the carrying out  of  an
environmental impact assessment.

In 1998 the National Environmental Management Act,  Act  107  of  1998,  was
published. This Act, often referred to as Nema, repealed many provisions  of
the Environmental Conservation Act. These repealed provisions are listed  in
section 50 of Nema.  Section  50  also  states  that  the  sections  of  the
Environment Conservation  Act  which  deal  with  the  environmental  impact
assessment regulations will also be repealed on a date to  be  published  by
the Minister in the Gazette. It further states that these  regulations  will
then be issued in terms of section 24 of Nema.

The use of road vehicles for recreational purposes on South  Africa's  coast
increased dramatically during the course of the last two or  three  decades.
The absence of regulations which control  off-road  vehicle  use  and  apply
uniformly to the entire coast resulted in damage to  ecologically  sensitive
coastal areas. Off-road vehicle use also posed a threat  to  the  safety  of
people engaged in various recreational activities and  was  diminishing  the
enjoyment derived from such activities.

The Minister of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  therefore  promulgated
regulations in the Gazette on 21 December 2001 to control  vehicles  in  the
coastal zone. The so-called 4x4  regulations were promulgated  in  terms  of
section 44 of Nema. The Minister could have  promulgated  these  regulations
in terms of the Environmental Conservation Act, as was  the  case  with  the
environmental impact assessment regulations I referred to earlier.  The  4x4
regulations are similar to the environmental impact  assessment  regulations
in the sense that they also require applications for the use of vehicles  in
the coastal zone to  be  subject  to  the  environmental  impact  assessment
procedures. However, in  the  light  of  the  fact  that  the  Environmental
Conservation  Act  is  being  phased  out  it  was  deemed  appropriate   to
promulgate the 4x4 regulations in terms of Nema.

In April this year the Port Elizabeth High Court  ruled  in  favour  of  the
Minister and dismissed with costs an application brought  by  the  SA  Shore
Angling Association. This association requested the High Court to set  aside
the   regulations   on   several   grounds,   including   their    purported
unconstitutionality.  Although  the  High  Court  ruled  in  the  Minister's
favour, the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism  received  legal
opinions to the effect that the 4x4 regulations  could  possibly  be  struck
down by the court as being ultra vires.

The purpose of the proposed amendment is to make it clear that the scope  of
Nema includes the  promulgation  of  regulations  aimed  at  prohibiting  or
restricting activities which can harm the environment, such as  the  use  of
vehicles in the coastal  zone.  The  promulgation  of  such  regulations  is
presently sanctioned  by  the  Environmental  Conservation  Act.  When  Nema
repeals the remaining provisions of  this  Act  it  will  be  essential  for
Nema's  scope  to  include  the  promulgation  of   regulations   aimed   at
prohibiting or restricting activities which may harm the environment.

I therefore urge hon members on behalf of the  Deputy  Minister  to  approve
the proposed amendments. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Rev  Moatshe,  you  may  now  rise  in  your
capacity as chairperson of the select committee.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, thank you very much.  You  are  allowing  me  to
wear more than one hat. Allow me to quote  to  this  House  from  my  mobile
Bible. Genesis 1:26, in line with this very topic, says:


  Then God said: ``Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,  and  let
  them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of  the  air,  over  the
  livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along
  the ground.''

Which  means  that  the  Almighty  undergirds  this  topic  which   we   are
articulating to this House this afternoon that the  environment  has  to  be
preserved.

[Chairperson and honourable House, allow me to speak. It is with  great  joy
and pride that I say a few words concerning the Bill that  is  in  front  of
us. It will have a huge influence on the citizens of South Africa.

I am referring to our considering the environment that should be  protected.
A safe environment brings health and wellbeing. It brings life and a  secure
future. Every environment affects  the  lives  of  people  anywhere.  We  as
lawmakers make laws that will protect the environment  and  the  people.  We
make the lives of the people valuable, even the economy of our  country.  We
should be against the people who destroy our country's environment.

Changes that are brought into the Constitution are  valuable  and  important
to our country and democracy. They remove attempts by or  doubts  raised  by
those who disagree with the powers given to the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism to render the environment safe.

I take it that we are one in spirit and that we agree  that  the  protection
of the environment is important to all the people and  the  living.  We  can
have a safe future only if we protect the environment that God gave us.

An environment that is riddled with problems is  a  threat  to  our  nation.
This is a challenge to our country, even to the international  world.  These
threats face us and our country at large.

A Motswana says that preparations are made well before the time. Really,  as
lawmakers we should ensure that we make laws that  are  valuable  and  bring
security, success and improvement.]

(Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[... agrees with the steps that can be taken  to  protect  the  environment.
This Bill in front of us clarifies that.

Motor vehicles like 4X4s cannot be allowed to drive on our  beaches  because
they trample everything. There are birds that lay their  eggs  in  the  sand
and they are endangered by the motor vehicles that drive everywhere.

Yes, calves  will  cease  to  jump  around  on  our  beaches.  Indeed,  when
something that  one  has  relied  upon  disappears,  one  should  know  that
problems have arrived. [Applause.]]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, as  die  agb  ``waarnemende  Minister''  en
voorsitter van ons komitee eendag besluit om die Noord-Kaap te besoek en  hy
wil in my nederige huis gaan bly om die natuur daar te ervaar, gaan  hy  die
dag as hy daar weggaan uit my huis uit, sy bes doen om die huis  ten  minste
in dieselfde toestand te laat as wat  hy  hom  gekry  het.  Maar  sensitiewe
mense soos hy sal dit gewoonlik selfs in 'n beter toestand wil laat  as  wat
hy dit gekry het.

Ons omgewing is iets wat ons ook net leen. Ons leen dit van ons nageslag  en
ons het presies dieselfde verantwoordelikheid om dit  nie  net  na  te  laat
soos ons dit gekry het nie, maar om dit na te laat aan ons  nageslag  in  'n
beter toestand as wat ons dit gekry het. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek gaan nou praat oor my agb kollega se Colt 4x4. Die eerste 4x4 wat ons  by
hierdie Parlement in die parkeerarea hier anderkant gesien het, is  dié  van
die vorige Minister  van  Landbou,  mnr  Derek  Hanekom.  Hy  het  'n  goeie
verskoning gehad, want hy wou orals in die platteland uitkom.  Ek  weet  nie
hoeveel hy destyds saam met die agb Sulliman op die strande gery het nie.

So 'n rukkie gelede het ek saam met my gesin tussen Danabaai en  Boggomsbaai
op die strand gaan staan en terwyl ons daar op die strand staan, toe  gebeur
daar  'n  wonderlike  ding.  Tussen  ons  voete  het  witmossels   uitgekom;
lewendige witmossels. Ons het dit gevat en ek het my kinders gaan  leer  hoe
'n mens witmossels vars kan eet en die see en die  natuur  kan  ervaar.  Dit
hoef nie 'n 4x4 te wees wat oor daardie stukkie strand ry  om  die  ekologie
te versteur nie. Dit kan 'n perd, 'n donkiekar, 'n fiets en selfs  'n  klomp
mense wees. Ons verwelkom egter hierdie wetsontwerp en  die  feit  dat  daar
oordeel is, en dat die omgewing goed bestuur  word,  dat  daar  op  gereelde
basis  impakstudies  gedoen  word,  want  ons  moet   beheer,   bestuur   en
kontroleer.

Ons moet ook nie die plaaslike owerheid se jurisdiksie  onderskat  nie.  Dit
is onmoontlik om uit Pretoria of uit die Kaap uit toestemming te gee vir  'n
stukkie strand in die Suid-Kaap tussen Boggomsbaai en  Danabaai.  Die  mense
wat die beste weet van daardie witmossels wat ons daar geëet het - en ek  is
nie seker of ons dit mág of nié mag gedoen het  nie,  want  ek  het  nie  'n
kwota vir wit mossels gehad  nie  -  is  die  mense  van  daardie  omgewing.
Daardie jurisdiksie mag nie van hulle weggeneem word nie.

Ons moet, wat die natuur aanbetref, begin om ``go-givers'' te  word  en  nie
``go-getters'' nie. Daar is te veel mense in Suid-Afrika en  in  die  wêreld
wat kyk hoeveel hulle uit die natuur uit  kan  kry  en  hoe  min  hulle  kan
terugsit. Ons gesindheid moet wees dat ons géé en nie net vat  nie.  Ons  in
die New NP steun hierdie wetsontwerp en ek wil my  betoog  afsluit  met  die
aanhaling van 'n klomp kinders wat gesing het:  ``Don't  kill  the  world''.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  if  the  hon  ``acting  Minister''  and
chairperson of our committee were to decide to visit the Northern  Cape  and
wished to stay over in my modest home so as to experience nature  there,  he
would, when he left my home again, do his best at least to leave it  in  the
same condition as he found it. But sensitive people like him  would  usually
want to leave it in an even better condition than they found it.

Our environment is also  something  that  we  only  have  on  loan.  We  are
borrowing  it  from  our  descendants  and  we   have   exactly   the   same
responsibility not merely to leave it the way we found it, but to  leave  it
to posterity in a better condition than we found it. [Interjections.]

I am now going to talk about my hon colleague's Colt 4x4. The first  4x4  we
ever saw here at Parliament, in the parking area just below us, was that  of
the former Minister of Agriculture, Mr Derek Hanekom. He had a good  excuse,
because he wanted to get to all the rural areas. I do not know how often  he
used to drive on the beaches with the hon Sulliman back then.

A while back my family and I were standing on  the  beach  between  Danabaai
and Boggomsbaai, and while we stood there on the beach  something  wonderful
happened. Between our feet white  mussels  started  to  appear;  live  white
mussels. We took some and I taught my children  how  to  eat  mussels  fresh
from the sea and how to experience the sea and nature. One does not  need  a
4x4 to drive across that section of the beach to  disturb  the  ecology.  It
could be a horse, a donkey cart, a  bicycle  or  even  a  group  of  people.
However, we welcome this Bill and the fact that there is  discernment,  that
the environment is being managed properly,  and  that  impact  studies  take
place on a regular basis, because we must control, manage and inspect.

We also should not underestimate  local  authorities'  jurisdiction.  It  is
impossible to give permission  from  Pretoria  or  Cape  Town  concerning  a
section of the beach between Boggomsbaai and Danabaai. The people  who  will
know best regarding those white mussels that we ate there -  and  I  am  not
sure whether we were or were not allowed to eat  them,  because  I  did  not
have a quota for white mussels - are the people from that area. They  should
not be deprived of that jurisdiction.

As far as nature is concerned, we must start to become go-givers and not go-
getters. Too many people in South Africa and across the world are trying  to
see how much they can get out of nature and how little  they  can  put  back
into it. Our attitude should be that we give and do not  just  take.  We  in
the New NP support this Bill and I would like to end my  speech  by  quoting
what a group of children once sang: ``Don't kill the world''. [Applause.]]

Nkk  J  N  VILAKAZI:  Sihlalo,  kuyangithokozisa  kakhulu   ukuba   ngomunye
wezikhulumi kule nkulumompikiswano esezithebeni namhlanje.

Inkulumo yami izoba mfishane kodwa idle  ngokuletha  umyalezo  ovela  ekhaya
esiFundazweni  saKwaZulu-Natali.   Ingqikithi   yawo   iqukethe   ukuphatha,
ukondliwa nokunakekelwa kwemvelo, ikakhulu  umhlaba  esihlala  kuwo.  Indawo
esihlala kuyo ibukeka  kahle,  iyakhangisa  kangangokuthi  iheha  izivakashi
noma izihambeli.

Indawo enewozawoza ezivakashini ingenisa umnotho.  Umhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe
womNyango  wezeMvelo  kanye  nezokuVakasha  ubhekele  uHulumeni  izwe  lonke
laseNingizimu Afrika. Izindawo  esihlezi  kuzo  kufanele  siziphathe  kahle.
Ezisematheni kulezi zinsuku amabhishi ahlanzekile naphathwa kahle, abe  nazo
izidingo ezidingwa izivakashi uma zizophola kuwo.

Abanye  bebethola  imali  enhle  ngokuthwala  izivakashi  ngezimoto  ezidume
ngokuthi  ama-4x4  okuthe  uma  kubonakala  ukuhlukumezeka  kwemvelo   eduze
nolwandle, umNyango  wezeMvelo  kanye  nezokuVakasha  wawushaya  lo  mThetho
osuchitshiyelwa namhlanje. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)
[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, it makes me very happy  to  be  one  of  the
speakers in the debate on the Bill that is on the Table today.

My speech will be short, but it will bring a strong message from my home  in
the province  of  KwaZulu-Natal.  Its  theme  consists  of  the  management,
nurturing and caring for nature, particularly in the  environment  in  which
we live. The environment in which we live is beautiful, interesting in  such
a way that it attracts tourists.

A place that is attractive to tourists brings in  investment.  The  hon  the
Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism oversees the  whole  of  South
Africa for the Government. We must look after the places in which  we  live.
The most talked about news these days is clean beaches that  are  also  well
looked after. They must have resources that tourists  need  when  they  have
come to relax on them.

Some people have been getting good money by  transporting  tourists  in  4x4
vehicles. When it was realised that nature near the  sea  is  being  abused,
the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism passed this Act that  is
being amended today.]
Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order:  This  is  the  second
time in about a week that when isiZulu is spoken in this House, we  have  no
interpreting service being made available. The isiZulu is indicated  on  the
speakers' list. This is unacceptable. We cannot carry on.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Someone has gone out to attend  to  this.  It
is not because it is Zulu.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, can I suggest  that  we  adjourn  until  we
have the interpreting service. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, it is  stated  on  the  speakers'
list that both English and Zulu will be  used.  You  have  gone  halfway  in
Zulu.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: They know Zulu is  my  language.  They  should  have  made
arrangements. I am not going to translate.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: There  will  be  a  translation.  I  am  just
reminding you that it is stated on the speakers' list that you are going  to
speak both English and Zulu.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Yes, but I always choose the language I want to speak.  It
is written here. [Interjections.] I am sorry.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, there was  no  contempt  for  the
fact that you were  speaking  Zulu.  The  hon  members  were  just  keen  to
understand what you were saying. It is on that note that  we  were  pleading
with you just for these last two minutes, to speak English.  The  choice  is
yours.

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Sihlalo, isifundazwe  sami  saKwaZulu-Natali  sithe  ngize
ngibeke lo mlayezo wokuthi  kuyezwela  eduze  nolwandle  esihlabathini  noma
ezihlahleni nasotshanini uma  ama-4x4  ehamba  khona.  Kukhona  nezilwanyana
ezincane ezifayo kanti azikwazi ukwanda uma kugidagida ama-4x4 phezu  kwazo.
(Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, my province, KwaZulu-Natal, has asked me  to
pass on the message that the driving of 4x4s there has a detrimental  effect
near the sea, on the sand or on the trees and  the  grass.  There  are  also
tiny insects that are dying out, as they cannot  multiply  when  4x4s  drive
over them.]
I think anyone who has been listening to Rev Moatshe will realise  that  the
terms which we are using are as similar as if wrote them together. I do  not
think I should deviate from what I have written in Zulu. [Interjections.]

Sihlalo, njengoba bengishilo isifundazwe sami saKwaZulu-Natali  sithe  ngize
ngibeke lo mlayezo wokuthi  kuyezwela  eduze  nolwandle  esihlabathini  noma
ezihlahleni nasotshanini uma  ama-4x4  ehamba  khona.  Kukhona  nezilwanyana
ezincane ezifayo kanti azikwazi ukwanda uma kugidagida ama-4x4 phezu kwazo.

Umbiko-ke  owokuthi  isifundazwe  saKwaZulu-Natali   simsekela   ngokugcwele
uNgqongqoshe uma evikela imvelo nokonakala komhlaba ogudle ulwandle.  Impela
bayoxola laba ebebenza imali ngokutetemukisa  izivakashi  ogwini  ngama-4x4.
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, as I have said, my province, KwaZulu-Natal, has  asked  me  to
pass on the message that the driving of 4x4s there has a detrimental  effect
near the sea, on the sand or on the trees and  the  grass.  There  are  also
tiny insects that are dying out, as they cannot  multiply  when  4x4s  drive
over them.
So I wish to report that the province of KwaZulu-Natal  fully  supports  the
Minister when he protects nature and the  land  along  the  sea  from  being
spoilt. Well, those who made a profit by  transporting  tourists  along  the
sea in 4x4s will have to do without.]

This amending Bill is mainly to provide for the prohibition, restriction  or
control of activities which are likely to have a detrimental effect  on  the
environment, and to provide for matters connected therewith.

Ukuvikelwa  kogu  kuzokwenza  imvelo  ikhule  kahle  futhi  ikhangise  kahle
ezivakashini. Amabhishi aKwaZulu-Natali angamanye  adume  kakhulu  emhlabeni
wonke, ngisho phela o-St Lucia Bay, Kosy Bay, Sodwana  Bay,  angisaphathi-ke
oThekwini Beach noMargate, akubuhle lobu ubhema ukholwe uma uhambele khona.

Ubuhle obunje buyadinga ukunakekelwa ukuze bugcineke kahle isikhathi  eside.
Izivakashi ziyobhema zikholwe  ubuhle.  Egameni  le-IFP  kanye  nesifundazwe
saKwaZulu-Natali   siyawusekela   lo   mThethosivivinyo.   Sithi    phambili
kumhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe  kanye  nomnyango  wakhe  ngokulondoloza  imvelo,
phambili!
AMALUNGU AHLONIPHEKILE: Phambili! (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[The protection of the coast will enable nature to grow  well  and  also  be
attractive to  tourists.  The  beaches  of  KwaZulu-Natal  are  among  those
beaches that are very famous worldwide. I am talking about  St  Lucia,  Kosi
Bay, Sodwana Bay, not to mention Durban  beach  and  Margate.  They  are  so
beautiful you feel really satisfied visiting them.

That beauty needs to be cared for so that it remains for a very  long  time.
Visitors will be satisfied with this beauty. On behalf of the  IFP  and  the
province of KwaZulu-Natal, we accept this Bill. We say forward  to  the  hon
the Minister and his department in preserving nature, forward!

HON MEMBERS: Forward!]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  members,  I  think  I  must  apologise,
because the person responsible for the interpreting did not turn up.  It  is
not going to  end  there.  We  are  going  to  report  this  matter  to  the
divisional manager.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, it seems, if I listen to the hon member who  has
just spoken and my hon colleague the chairperson of  the  select  committee,
that I can say siyahambisana, that is, we are  going  together.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

This is a simple Bill in a certain sense, but the whole field  is  extremely
complex, partly because  it  is  the  nature  or  reality  of  dealing  with
environmental issues, which are multidisciplinary and cut  across  different
departments, tiers and levels of government. This  often  involves  multiple
jurisdiction  and  cascading  decision-making.  For  the  public,  this   is
confusing because it means multiple permit requirements.

I listened to the  excellent  speech  here  of  my  hon  colleague,  but  no
ordinary person going out on a Sunday  afternoon  for  a  drive  can  really
understand what he is  talking  about.  It  is  an  impossibility.  Multiple
jurisdiction remains a problem on the coast. May I  say,  just  to  give  an
example, that if one wishes to launch a boat, one had to do so from a  boat-
launching site, for which one needs a permit. Then one needs to have a boat-
launching manager, like a harbour master, who can actually launch the  boat.
So, one needs two permits in terms of the Seashore Act; one needs  a  permit
in terms of the Environmental Conservation Act; one  needs  two  permits  in
terms of off-road vehicle regulations. And these permits,  to  make  matters
worse,  are  issued   by   different   bodies   and   different   government
institutions. So, there are exemptions. But to get an  exemption,  one  will
often need an environmental impact statement for which one has to  pay,  and
at the end of it one is not sure whether one  is  going  to  get  permission
either. There is no guarantee that one will get permission.

I am pointing this out because for the public matters are unclear and  often
they simply give up under the weight of  administrative  paralysis  or  they
simply ignore the law. Let me say that with our coastline of about 7 000  km
it is almost impossible to administer the law  unless  one  has  public  co-
operation. The public must respect the law, and the law must  be  accessible
and understandable to the public.

Enforcibility of  environmental  provisions  remains  very  difficult.  Much
enforcing needs to  be  done,  as  my  hon  colleague  has  said,  by  local
authorities who know the position on the ground, and are there. But they  do
not  always  know  what  their  rights  are  and  where  their  rights   and
responsibilities begin or end - usually they end at the high-water mark  and
they have no jurisdiction over the area between the low-water mark  and  the
high-water mark.

There  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  intention  or  the  spirit   of   this
legislation, as my hon colleague has put it so very,  very  well.  The  fact
is, it simply endorses  the  current  status  quo  and  brings  clarity.  It
remains highly desirable and imperative to protect our fragile coastal  zone
with its often rare plants, animals and intertidal marine life.  It  is  the
interface where the sea and the shore meet, where  nature  and  marine  life
climax, and where mankind climaxes and is most prevalent and active.  It  is
interesting to note that 90% of the world population lives on the  coast  or
on rivers or waterways. So that is where one has  this  interface  and  this
clash.

Just as ski boats and diving technology have exposed previously  remote  and
protected reefs at sea, often causing major plundering - perlemoen being  an
example - so the advent of  the  four-wheel  drive  vehicle  has  opened  up
remote and fragile areas that were previously  inaccessible.  But  this  new
accessibility  has  heightened  the  assault,  not  only  upon  the  fragile
shoreline, but it has opened up a new front to assault  marine  life  in  an
unsustainable way, often illegally. We need to  act,  but  we  need  to  act
sensibly, in order to protect  whilst  simultaneously  attempting  to  cater
sustainably  for  the  legitimate  leisure  and   commercial   pursuits   of
reasonable people in an understandable way.

If the Minister did not bring this legislation, as my hon colleague  put  it
at the beginning, the current off-road  vehicle  regulations  would  be  set
aside. So we support it. A  problem  that  remains,  however,  is  that  the
coastal zone is incredibly inaccurately described. I do not  know  what  the
coastal zone means. It sometimes means 100 m or it can mean dunes which  are
several kilometres inland. The definition of what the coastal zone is, is  a
problem, just like the definition of what the admiralty area  is,  and  even
the definition of where the high- water mark  is  and  where  the  low-water
mark is.

However, coastal areas are not the only problem. Today  people  are  opening
4x4 trails in mountain catchment areas not covered by legislation. And  this
too may need attention, because very often these areas  are  also  extremely
fragile, and of course with a penchant for high rainfall and erosion.

We support these amendments  -  they  are  essential.  But  we  do  need  to
simplify the regulatory process for the public. The fact is that the  advent
of the 4x4 has opened up the country in a wonderful way and the leisure  and
hospitality industry is a very  important  one.  We  will  need  to  find  a
balance. We do not want to hamper this industry. The 4x4 has  often  been  a
lifeline  to  inaccessible  rural  areas.   It   has   opened   up   tourism
opportunities in areas which previously did not have any. So, they are  very
good things, but we do need to protect our fragile areas,  and  there  is  a
need to control and define vehicular access. My appeal is that this is  done
sensibly and simply; that good, clear signposting  makes  things  clear  for
the public, that the decision-making takes place on a one-stop basis at  the
lowest possible level and in a co-ordinated way.

We support the legislation. My hon colleague  said  that  God  gave  us  the
licence to use nature; He did not give  us  the  licence  to  abuse  nature.
[Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, at the outset may I just say that  I  am  reading
the hon Mrs Versfeld's speech on her behalf as she is ill. In that  sense  I
ask the House to acknowledge that I do not  have  the  different  hats  that
Moruti Moatshe has, but I have no objection  if  they  wish  to  imagine  me
wearing a blonde wig while I read Mrs Versfeld's speech.

I have doubts about  giving  the  Minister  all  this  power.  I  think  the
Minister should consult with local authorities, because in  many  instances,
by not allowing off-road vehicles in certain  areas,  the  tourism  in  many
towns will suffer, especially on the West Coast.

There is also the danger that people who are  involved  in  subsistence  net
fishing will not be able to get to the beach without a vehicle. So it has  a
lot to do with regulations and permit conditions. However, we  believe  this
will also be clarified under the definition of activities.

The amendments in this Bill are merely of a technical nature and remove  any
legal uncertainty about the Minister's power. The Bill  also  gives  a  more
precise definition of activities than was found in  the  principal  Act.  We
support this amendment to prevent further degradation of our environment.

Mr R N NYAKANE: Chairperson, the amendments that are effected  here  to  the
principal Act are aimed at ensuring that the intentions  and  objectives  of
the Constitution are realised. Section 24(a) and (b) enshrines the right  of
every person to a protected and healthy environment,  and  thus  imposes  an
obligation for the prevention of its pollution and ecological degradation.

The amendments that are being effected today have  been  occasioned  by  the
recreational activities that are carried out  in  4x4  vehicles  by  wealthy
people who place a high premium on their personal interests without  concern
for the negative impact that arises as a result of environmental  pollution.
Such a practice might lead to the discouragement of tourism, let  alone  the
culture that would be taught to  our  children  that  frequent  our  beaches
regularly. Recreational activities in 4X4 vehicles are  nothing  other  than
the wealthy man's gesture of indulging in a demonstration of wealth  and  in
conspicuous consumption practices.

Given that, a few kilometres outside coastline cities, we have  millions  of
historically disadvantaged South Africans who still grapple daily  with  the
scourge  of  abject  poverty,  unemployment,  water   shortages   and   poor
sanitation, in KZN we usually experience a high  incidence  of  cholera  and
other waterborne diseases.

Some time ago I used to enjoy  a  song  which  goes  as  follows:  ``It's  a
strange, strange world we live in,  Master  Jack''.  Yes,  it  is  indeed  a
strange world that we live  in,  because  instead  of  building  up  poverty
relief funds to assist their immediate neighbours, these wealthy  guys  tend
to be complacent as though everybody is self-sufficient.

We are indeed a strange society,  especially  in  South  Africa;  a  strange
society in the sense that we regard the  state  as  the  sole  provider.  We
insist that it is the Government's responsibility to fight  poverty,  crime,
unemployment, etc. We forget that individuals, the private sector, NGOs  and
the business sector have equal responsibility.

The labour that sustains affluent businesspeople who  are  operating  within
the coastline cities comes  from  the  neighbouring  poverty-stricken  black
communities who are  living  in  shacks.  It  is  inhumane  to  continuously
extract energy and mental acumen  from  the  poor  without  any  thought  of
ploughing anything back. I therefore wish to  put  it  on  record  that  the
money which is spent on 4x4s by wealthy people should rather  be  channelled
into the rural integrated development programme.

In conclusion, I would like to share with this House  the  following  words.
This time it is not a song, but these are the words  that  I  got  from  our
Daily Bread religious booklet:


  To ease the heartache in our world that causes us to cry, lets do what we
  can do to help that needy one close to us.

Before I resume my seat I would like once more to share with you  one  thing
I learned when we were in China recently. I did not  learn  this  particular
lesson from the Chinese, but from one of  our  colleaques.  I  am  proud  to
mention his name here, the hon Ralane. He taught us  this  song  almost  the
whole day: ``Inja one, inja ho!'' [Laughter.] He coined  it,  spiced  it  up
and said: ``Inja one, inja war!''  Otherwise  the  UDM  supports  this  Bill
wholeheartedly. [Laughter.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   65   of   the
Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:31.
