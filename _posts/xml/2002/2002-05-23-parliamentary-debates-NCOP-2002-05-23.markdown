                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I give  notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with alarm the gathering food crisis in Southern Africa and the
       plight of millions that are beginning to starve in the region;


  (2) accepts the strategic importance of agriculture in South  Africa  and
       the need for basic foodstuffs at affordable prices  to  be  available
       from South Africa to the other countries in the region;


  (3) takes note of the -


       (a)  recent increased subsidies to farmers in the USA to keep them in
           production; and


       (b)  continuing large-scale support that agriculture receives in  the
           European Union, Japan and elsewhere;


  (4) calls on the Government to take steps to ensure  the  continued  food
       safety of  South  Africa  as  well  as  the  physical  and  financial
       protection of those who live and work in our  countryside,  producing
       the food we need;
  (5) proudly acknowledges the role of agricultural development with regard
       to the growth and stability of our region, including the role of  the
       agri-industrial and foodprocessing sectors, as well  as  beneficiated
       agricultural and food exports; and


  (6) proudly notes that South Africa remains one of the  world's  few  net
       agricultural surplus food exporters and that we need to  nurture  and
       preserve this national asset.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the embarrassing failure of the DP leadership  to  account  for
       funding made to the party;


  (2) further notes that  this  failure  was  confirmed  before  the  Desai
       commission on Tuesday, 21 May 2002, when Mr Hennie Bester's testimony
       clearly contradicted what Mr Gerald Morkel had said in a statement on
       12 April this year about a donation of R500 000 allegedly made to the
       party by one Jürgen Harksen;


  (3) expresses  its  concern  about  these  unashamed  violations  of  the
       principles  of  accountability  and  transparency  and  about   their
       apartheid-style spy shenanigans in the Western Cape Legislature;


  (4) expresses  the  opinion  that  this  immoral  conduct  by  DP  public
       representatives confirms the widely held belief  that  the  DP  is  a
       party in decay and lacks moral leadership; and


  (5) expresses the firm belief that it goes against the grain of the Moral
       Regeneration Initiative spearheaded by the ANC-led Government and all
       other moral initiatives by civil society.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Minister for Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
       accused  Archbishop  Tutu  of  hypocrisy  and  used  the  shelter  of
       Parliament to do so;


  (2) further notes that he did so to avoid taking responsibility  for  the
       political favouritism displayed by the latest series of  presidential
       pardons;


  (3) recognises that -


       (a)  the TRC process was designed to expose, and  thereby  heal,  the
           wounds of our divided past; and


       (b)  it did so at great emotional and financial cost to  our  nation;
           and
  (4) therefore expresses regret at the fact that President Mbeki chose  to
       negate this healing process by ignoring the TRC and pardoning  brutal
       killers simply because of their political allegiances.

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the remarks by President Mbeki when  he  criticised  local  and
       provincial government  institutions  for  their  failure  to  deliver
       services;


  (2) further notes that the ANC regularly blames institutional  incapacity
       for their failures, but  appears  to  take  few  practical  steps  to
       address this need; and


  (3) reminds the ANC that in a democracy their majority should not  render
       them unfeeling about the needs of the voters.
                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

       compatriot, colleague and comrade, the hon Curnick Ndlovu, member  of
       the National Assembly;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  Comrade Ndlovu was a true revolutionary in  every  respect,  and

           people;


       (b)  his contribution was second to none; and


       (c)  he  was  freedom-loving,  a  unionist,  a  soldier  of  uMkhonto

       Ndlovu made in the struggle for liberation, both as an  activist  and
       as a member of Parliament; and

       bereavement.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Mkhanyakude district in KwaHlabisa on the North  Coast

       the Africa Centre, which is tasked with doing research on  a  vaccine
       for the disease;


  (3) believes that this centre will  provide  much-needed  research  which
       will assist in policies we make with regards to health and population

                              IMMIGRATION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome the hon the Minister of Home Affairs  and  call  upon
him to address this House.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: I thank the Chairperson and  hon  members  for
that welcome. I would like to say I  take  great  pride  this  afternoon  in
fulfilling a most rewarding task.

Today the National Council of Provinces  has  the  opportunity  to  close  a
chapter of policy formulation which has engaged public  debate  for  several
years. However, there is a sense that aspects of this debate  are  bound  to
continue. This is due both to the very nature of the subject matter  and  to
the outcome of the parliamentary process.

The Immigration Bill comes before  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  in
terms of the procedures laid down in section  75  of  the  Constitution,  in
terms of which only the concurrence of the National Council of Provinces  is
sought. The Bill before us is the same as approved by the National  Assembly
last Friday, as the select committee did not recommend any amendments.

The Bill, as approved by the National Assembly, was fundamentally  different
from the one introduced by Cabinet in many respects, not least of  which  is
that it replaced the central core of the migration policy which lies in  the
issuance of work permits. Now,  as  introduced,  the  Bill  provided  for  a
market-driven technique satisfying the needs  test  which  determines  which
foreigners are  needed  by  our  economy.  This  needs  test  centred  on  a
licensing fee, which was to be paid by the employer,  leaving  the  employer
to determine the needed foreigners, their job  descriptions,  qualifications
and length of temporary employment.

As I understood it, the needs test based on a licensing fee  was  considered
by the joint meetings of the select committee and  the  portfolio  committee
until 8 May. Only on the morning of 15 May was I  informally  informed  that
the market-related approach, espoused by Cabinet and set out in the Bill  as
introduced, was going to be substituted  by  the  committees  with  a  quota
system, reflecting the statist philosophy of a  command  economy.  This  was
the  product  of  extensive  redrafting  in  which  my  department  was  not
involved. The Bill was voted on during the afternoon  of  April  15  by  the
select committee, without having had the  time  to  consider  the  range  of
technical and administrative amendments and considerations submitted  by  my
department  to  highlight  real  difficulties  and  some  mistakes  in   the
redrafted Bill.

Now, during the  select  committee  stage,  my  department  resubmitted  the
considerations and proposed amendments which could not be considered by  the
select committee, inclusive of additional issues which arose out of how  the
text of the Bill was partially transformed as it moved  from  the  portfolio
committee to the National Assembly. I am given  to  understand  that  during
the committee stage the majority party tabled a proposal to scrap the  quota
system and replace it with a labour certification  process  similar  to  the
one currently employed in terms of the Aliens Control Act.

Unfortunately,  the  select  committee  decided  that  there  would  not  be
sufficient time to entertain any amendment  to  the  Bill,  but  sent  me  a
message inviting me to table amendments in Cabinet as soon  as  possible  to
change the Immigration  Act  once  it  is  adopted  and  its  implementation
begins. The message indirectly conveyed to  me  from  the  select  committee
highlights the need to formulate such amendments in  consultation  with  all
role-players and stakeholders.

One can only assume that the main object of this  request  from  the  select
committee relates to the issuance of work permits, since the  main  proposed
amendments before the committee, which the committee did not have  the  time
to entertain, were on this subject, except  for  the  many  technically  and
administratively  necessary  amendments   which   were   submitted   by   my
department. We are faced then with the unusual situation in which a Bill  is
substantially transformed in the  portfolio  committee  and  by  members  of
Parliament in about five days, without the  assistance  or  even  any  input
whatsoever from the responsible line-function department.

The majority party then tries to change the work product of the Bill  during
the select committee stage and runs out of time. The select committee  could
also not attend to objective technical and administrative problems and  look
into the possibility that certain clauses were deleted on account of a late-
night minuting error of the deliberations of the portfolio committee,  which
could not be caught before the National Assembly  stage,  as  the  Bill  was
distributed only minutes prior to our deliberations.

Against this background, I, as the Minister responsible,  am  requested  now
to introduce amendments to change Parliament's work product, which  in  turn
changed what  Cabinet  had  introduced  in  Parliament.  For  instance,  the
perception arises that Parliament is not satisfied with the command  economy
quota system introduced in this Bill, as much as I  am  not  satisfied  with
it. In fact, my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Industry, said as  much
to me yesterday.

However, I do not  have  a  clear  indication  of  why  Parliament  was  not
satisfied with the market-based licensing technique introduced  by  Cabinet,
which was, in fact, consonant with this age of  globalisation  in  which  we
are living. Therefore, I will be not in the position of merely producing  an
amendment the day after the enactment of this Bill, as much as I would  like
to do that, as one would need to interrogate many questions and will  do  so
in consultation with all those who participated in this process in the  past
six years. Without doubt and with the full measure I am capable of,  I  will
comply, of course, with the request of Parliament. I am a democrat and as  a
Minister of state, I will not move in a direction different from that  which
Parliament wishes to chart for immigration control in this country.

However, it must be made  abundantly  clear  that  no  amendment,  with  the
exception of technical amendments, can  be  made  overnight  in  respect  of
developing something which may replace the quota system, unless I  am  asked
to reintroduce in Parliament the scheme originally adopted  by  Cabinet  and
was based on a licensing fee. We negotiated  this  scheme  extensively,  and
studied  all  aspects   of   its   implications   and   prepared   for   its
implementation.

If we are to propose something different, which is not yet known to  us,  we
need to negotiate it with  all  stakeholders  and  role-players,  especially
those who have already registered their annoyance with the formulation of  a
quota system in a matter of days, for the first time ever in our debate  and
without their input. This will take time. In the meantime, we will be  duty-
bound to implement the Immigration Bill as adopted by this Parliament.

I want to assure Parliament that we will make the quota system work  for  as
long as it is the law of the country. In my opinion, it is by far the  worst
possible option, in terms of the difficulty of  implementation  and  because
of the procedures  it  requires  both  in  respect  of  the  formulation  of
categories and in respect of the processing of each single  application.  It
is going to be difficult, but we will leave no  stone  unturned  to  try  to
make it work to the best of our capacity. The  Department  of  Home  Affairs
has highly dedicated officials as we have just heard from the hon  member  a
few minutes ago. Our  training  programmes  on  the  Immigration  Bill  have
already  begun  and  we  will  now  need  to  readjust  them  to  meet   the
requirements.

The Department of Home Affairs will need to  be  provided  with  significant
assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry in the  formulation  of
quotas. Yesterday, my colleague the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry  was
quoted by the media as stating that the Immigration Bill had been  improved.
Reportedly he feels that it will be easy to implement it in a way that  will
not  hinder  the  immigration  of  foreigners  with  their  needed   skills.
Therefore  I  trust  that  he  will  be  forthcoming  with  the  information
necessary to  delineate  the  characterising  features  of  each  and  every
category of potentially needed foreign  workers,  together  with  a  numeric
evaluation which can withstand both public and judicial scrutiny. His  sense
of confidence does therefore give us great hope.

Parliament and the public must accept our commitment to implement the  quota
system as well as the fact that we are going to to  have  to  go  through  a
steep learning curve. We never focused on this possibility as it  was  ruled
out almost immediately at the outset,  at  the  Green  Paper  stage  of  the
process. In this respect, I must clarify a common  misperception,  that  the
Bill introduced by Cabinet contained a  quota  system.  This  is  absolutely
untrue. The only provision in the previous draft of the Bill was for  quotas
which my department could elect to determine in very  special  circumstances
as a fast track for a specified category of specially needed foreigners  who
would not need to pay the licensing fee and  could  receive  a  permit  even
without a job offer. We were not required to use that option, and if we  had
been, we would have used it in reaction to a  need  which  would  in  itself
have  identified  the  number  of  foreigners  and  the  features  of  their
category; for instance, if we were to  create  a  fast  track  for  100  000
computer programmers. This is obviously not a quota system.  Therefore,  our
efforts to develop a quota system will need to begin from scratch.

Our efforts to build a quota system have already begun and my officials  are
collecting and processing information right now. The quotas  for  this  year
will need to be of a more general nature to simplify  their  administration.
In fact, it must be appreciated  that  in  addition  to  the  difficulty  in
delineating categories, we need to establish complex internal procedures  to
verify that the available job  position  fits  the  category  and  that  the
qualifications and curriculum of the applicant do the same.

At times this will be extremely difficult, but  we  will  try  our  best  to
create techniques  that  reduce  administrative  discretion  and  avoid  the
interminable  delays  which  are  often  associated  with  our   having   to
supplement our lack of in-house  expertise  with  consultations  with  other
organs of state and a large number of institutions of civil  society.  There
is some reminiscent knowledge about quota systems in my department, as  they
experimented with this technique in 1987 before abandoning it.

The process ahead is going to be much  more  difficult  than  we  hoped  for
additional reasons.  Nevertheless,  we  will  endure  the  uphill  path  and
deliver to the country the  best  results  we  can  produce.  In  fact,  the
original Bill made provision for an expedited form  of  rationalisation  and
restructuring which would create a short cut through some  of  the  relevant
legislative provisions. This was necessary because the Immigration Act  will
bring  about  not  only  a  major  legislative  reform  but  also  a   major
administrative reform of the Department of  Home  Affairs  itself.  We  will
need to change what our officials do to meet the new requirements. All  this
will take time and it is likely that things may get worse  before  they  get
better. We must accept that we will need to go  from  the  old  to  the  new
through a difficult process of readjustment, retraining and restructuring.

However, I am confident that at the end of  this  process  we  will  all  be
satisfied that it was worth going through the difficulties of  this  reform.
Our country can now take pride in having a much better system  of  migration
control in spite of all the things that I have  said.  We  have  closed  the
final chapter in transforming the legal system and the policy  framework  we
inherited from  colonialism  and  apartheid.  The  Aliens  Control  Act  was
apartheid's last Act in 1991, and  today  the  NCOP  has  the  privilege  of
declaring that in terms of policies and legislation, the  new  South  Africa
is now fully fledged and grown.

The Immigration Bill places South Africa on a par with many other  countries
in respect of many of its provisions, especially in  respect  of  investors'
and intracompany transfer permits. In many respects the Bill  before  us  is
an excellent Bill. Its real final effect will depend on the  resources  that
Parliament will make available for its implementation, which  will  need  to
be increased from the  present  allocations  and  from  what  we  originally
estimated as the financial implications of the Bill. There is no doubt  that
many of  the  changes  call  for  increased  utilisation  of  administrative
capacity, especially in respect of the functions and  procedures  which  the
original Bill had delegated to chartered accountants  and  other  organs  of
civil society.

The Bill now requires the  department  to  maintain  a  parallel  system  of
capacity and functions even in respect of these matters. Our  intention  was
to diminish the administrative capacity we employed for the  processing  and
issuance of permits so as to increase the administrative capacity  available
to deter, detect and deport illegal foreigners. Unless we  deal  with  those
who are outside the system and continue to stay in  the  Republic  illegally
without fear of being detected  and  deported,  anything  we  place  in  our
immigration laws will be of little value. Many  members  will  have  watched
television last night and seen the big  demonstration  that  took  place  in
front of my office in  Pretoria  yesterday  and  the  pronouncement  by  one
luminary among the demonstrators who said that those who are in the  country
must be allowed to be here. I wish I knew one country on planet earth  which
did that.

Our promise was that we would open the  front  door  of  immigration  wider,
while we would close the back door to  illegal  immigration.  We  will  need
more resources and capacity to fulfil this promise. We are at the  beginning
of a process and Parliament has my pledge this afternoon that both I and  my
department will do our respective best to make it work in the  interests  of
the country. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, just to outline the process that I  am  going  to
be following, I will be speaking largely on the principle of  the  Bill  and
outlining the process that we have been following up  to  today.  Colleagues
speaking afterwards will focus on  some  of  the  details  of  some  of  the
clauses that we have dealt with.

It is once more my honour and privilege to rise to address this House  on  a
very important piece of legislation, namely  the  Immigration  Bill.  It  is
indeed also a relief to finally witness the passage  of  this  Bill  through
the two Houses of Parliament. I am sure the Minister will agree as  well.  I
think it is particularly so for the members of the select committee who  had
study groups not only in the joint committee,  but  also  in  their  various
political parties, which worked very hard to get us where we are today.  All
of them need to be commended for this.

I want to highlight a few points from the preamble of the  Bill,  and  these
are: ``Setting in place a new system of immigration  control  which  ensures
that - firstly, the needs and aspirations of the age  of  globalisation  are
respected; secondly, the South African economy may have access at all  times
to the full measure of needed contributions by  foreigners;  thirdly,  ports
of entry are efficiently administered  and  managed;  fourthly,  immigration
control is performed  within  the  highest  applicable  standards  of  human
rights protection; and, fifthly, xenophobia is prevented and countered  both
within Government and civil society.

These are some of the points, amongst others. Judging from  the  above,  the
aims and principles of the Bill are very clear.

To move on to the process, I want to start  with  the  public  participation
process. The  process  of  public  participation  and  consultation  by  the
committees was very extensive and lasted for one  whole  week.  It  is  also
just unfortunate that in that one week we could  not  accommodate  everybody
who wanted to make submissions, but we tried our level best.

Presentations ranged from Business  SA  to  the  UN  High  Commissioner  for
Refugees. We spent many hours listening to  and  interrogating  the  various
inputs from these stakeholders. Some even engaged us during tea  breaks  and
lunch, because they felt very strongly about the  views  they  were  putting
forward.

To go on to the parliamentary  process,  because  of  the  time  constraints
Parliament  faced  by  the  June  2  deadline  placed   upon   it   by   the
Constitutional  Court  ruling,  the  portfolio  committee  and  the   select
committee decided to embark on joint sittings to expedite the processing  of
the Bill. Even though the whole select committee was  not  present  all  the
time, dedicated members of all political parties were present at  all  times
and participated in all the proceedings of the joint committee.

I thought I should mention this because members of the public and even  some
of  our  colleagues  might  question  why  the  NCOP  only  spent  two  days
processing the Bill. When deliberations started,  there  were  approximately
eight areas of contention amongst political parties. But  I  must  say  that
through bilateral discussions and negotiations between parties,  these  were
eventually narrowed down to three.

The three areas are, largely, the work permit, which is the  current  clause
19 in the Bill; the restructuring of the department, which was  subsequently
removed;  and  the  section  on  offences,  clause  49.  These   were   also
subsequently the only areas that were voted on by the  portfolio  committee.
I am mentioning this  just  to  indicate  the  lengths  to  which  political
parties, all of us, tried to go to find each other  during  the  process  of
deliberating. On the three clauses I have just mentioned, we have agreed  to
disagree.

It is clear from the  debates  we  had  in  the  joint  committee  that  all
political parties would have loved to see a  better  product  than  we  have
before us today. The  amendments  put  forward  by  all  of  us  during  the
deliberations bear testimony to this.  What  made  deliberations  even  more
difficult was the unclear position on the status of  our  migration  policy,
or what is commonly referred to as the White Paper on migration.  I  hope  I
will have a later opportunity  to  actually  ask  the  Minister  to  clarify
exactly what the status of that White Paper is.

The state law adviser commented that there was no  way  in  which  we  could
have made wholesale amendments to the Bill without rewriting it.  Given  the
time limitations, we chose not to do that and not to go that route.

All Bills that pass through Parliament have their shortcomings and this  one
is no exception. There is the saying that the proof of  the  pudding  is  in
the eating. It is therefore only on implementation that we will be  able  to
identify these shortcomings and loopholes. It is then perfectly  within  the
mandate of the Minister to present  these  to  us  and  to  propose  further
amendments for consideration by Parliament. It is in that light that I  made
my comments yesterday and put the request to the Minister of  Home  Affairs.
We all agree that no law is cast in stone and is  subject  to  amendment  as
and when  the  conditions  on  the  ground  change.  I  think  there  is  no
disagreement among any of us that that is the case now.

To conclude, I would like to thank  the  Minister  and  his  department  for
their tireless efforts in assisting and guiding  us  through  the  long  and
difficult times of deliberations. Two of the people from his department  are
here today - Mr Lambinon, the deputy director-general, and Adv Malatji,  who
is the legal adviser in the department.  The  parliamentary  liaison  person
also sat with us throughout, sometimes for very long hours. A  special  word
of thanks also goes to the state law advisers, Adv Kellner  and  Adv  Tladi,
who slaved through many long hours with us.

Last, but not least, I would  like  to  thank  the  members  of  the  select
committee who, over the past month, worked very diligently and attended  our
meetings  almost  on  a  daily  basis,  sometimes   shifting   aside   other
responsibilities to facilitate the smooth passage of this Bill  through  the
NCOP. I therefore propose the  adoption  of  this  Bill  on  behalf  of  the
committee. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  colleagues,  friends,  the
Department of Home Affairs has spent five years working on this  Immigration
Bill. Business has been pressing for a  new  immigration  law  to  speed  up
recruitment of foreign professionals to fill vacancies and  posts  evacuated
by skilled workers who have left the country since the mid-1980s.

Business organisations estimate the skills deficit at approximately 500  000
people. Since 1995, 5 000 people  have  immigrated  to  South  Africa  every
year, but businesses complain about the cost and delays involved in  foreign
recruitment. We definitely need managed immigration that can  contribute  to
the stimulation of economic growth and the development of South Africa.

In the end we in the  NCOP  were  handed  the  Bill,  which  was  still,  as
business people say, an obstacle to economic growth. My  party  agrees  that
the Bill is an enormous improvement on the present  levels  of  uncertainty.
But we have our reservations on at least  three  clauses  of  the  Bill.  We
agree with the Minister, who said, ``The Bill represents a  monumental  step
ahead and sets our country on a much  stronger  footing  to  cope  with  the
issues of migration control that are bound  to  rise  exponentially  in  the
years to come.''

Ons het baie gehoor van waarom en waarvoor en hoekom die  wetsontwerp  nodig
is, hoekom dit van kardinale belang is. Ons het gehoor van ons verskille  en
van die verskillende klousules. Ek wil nou weer op 'n meer praktiese  manier
vir die agb Minister voorbeelde noem van  waar  daar  onduidelikhede  is  en
waarom hierdie wetgewing so broodnodig is.

Daar  is  onduidelikheid  of  die  korporatiewe  permitte   waarvolgens   'n
maatskappy toestemming kan kry om 'n aantal  buitelanders  na  die  land  te
bring deel is van die kwotabepalings. Kragtens laasgenoemde moet  die  staat
bepaal  watter  kundigheid  en  vaardighede  skaars   is   en   daarkragtens
werkpermitte aan buitelanders uitreik. Dit is ook waarom die sakesektor  die
kwotastelsel as tydrowend en burokraties afmaak.

Hoewel my party saamstem dat  ons  kundige  mense  broodnodig  het,  is  die
toestroming van onwettige immigrante na ons land nog 'n groot kopseer.  Baie
van hierdie mense het geen werkpermitte nie, of vervalste  permitte  is  aan
die orde van die dag. Dit lyk my dit is makliker om as  onwettige  immigrant
die land in te kom en 'n  las  vir  die  land  te  word  as  om  as  wettige
immigrant in te kom en 'n bate vir die land te wees.

Ons mense - en ek praat nou veral van die Oos-Kaap en in  die  besonder  van
Port Elizabeth - kla dat veral immigrante - en ek  gaan  die  land  se  naam
noem - van Senegal besig is om die lewe vir Suid-Afrikaners te bemoeilik  en
ook werkgeleenthede van hulle weg te neem. Hierdie  mense  is  onder  andere
ook veral straatventers en verkoop  minderwaardige  namaaksels  van  bekende
handelsnaamprodukte teen pryse wat mededingend is met die ware jakob.

Baie van hulle is ook werkloos en in die sentrale deel  van  Port  Elizabeth
het hulle al 'n deel afgebaken  wat  hulle  as  hul  land  beskou  waar  húl
landswette geld. Die polisie het my meegedeel dat hulle  as  SAPD  nie  daar
toegelaat word nie. Hulle mag nie daar inkom nie. Misdaad soos  dwelmhandel,
ens vier daar hoogty. Ons polisiebeamptes is al só gedemoraliseer dat  hulle
nie meer hul pligte toegewyd en met erns kan  uitvoer  nie.  Ek  sê  hierdie
dinge omdat die polisie van die Humewood-stasie in Port Elizabeth  my  gevra
het  om  dit  in  die  openbaar  te  sê.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Húlle!  Hierdie
onwettige immigrante van Senegal is volgens die polisie  ook  die  skuldiges
wat veral verbind word met die grootskaalse  selfoondiefstalle  wat  nou  in
die stad aan die orde van  die  dag  is.  Hierdie  mense  het  hierdie  tipe
diefstal tot 'n absolute kuns vervolmaak. Hiervan kan  ek  getuig,  want  ek
was ook al aan die verkeerde kant van hulle flinke steelvermoë. Die  polisie
het nie 'n oomblik gehuiwer nie om die diefstal toe te skryf aan  Senegalese
wat onwettig in die land is. Hulle opereer gewoonlik so in  pare  of  as  'n
drietal, en spits hulle veral toe op winkelsentrums en die strandgebiede.

Hoewel daar nou verskeie wysigings voorgestel is deur beide die ANC  en  die
IVP, het die gekose komitee van die Nasionale Raad  van  Provinsies  besluit
om die wetgewing  goed  te  keur  soos  dit  in  die  Nasionale  Vergadering
gedebatteer en goedgekeur is. Ons doen egter 'n beroep op  die  Minister  om
weer te dink. Daar is groot tekortkominge.
Daar moet geleentheid gegee word om voort te gaan om 'n  wet  daar  te  stel
wat tot die voordeel van die hele Suid-Afrika sal strek. Ons  het  reeds  in
die komitee aangedui watter klousules gewysig moet word.  Ek  gaan  dit  nie
nou herhaal nie. Ons het wetgewing nodig wat  die  ongewenstes  sal  uithou,
maar wat die nuttiges sal binnenooi. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[We have often heard why and for what reasons we need this Bill, why  it  is
necessary, and why  it  is  of  vital  importance.  We  have  heard  of  our
differences and of the different clauses. I would like to  now,  in  a  more
practical manner, cite examples to the hon the Minister of where  there  are
uncertainties and why this legislation is so essential.

There is a lack of clarity about whether the corporate  permits,  whereby  a
company gets permission to bring a number of foreigners  into  the  country,
are part of the quota provisions. In terms of the latter the  state  has  to
determine which expertise and skills are scarce and in accordance with  that
issue work permits to foreigners. This is why the corporate  sector  regards
the quota system as time-consuming and bureaucratic.

Although my party agrees that we badly need experts, the influx  of  illegal
immigrants to our country is a huge headache. Many of these  people  do  not
have work permits or forged permits are the order of the day.  It  seems  to
be easier to come into the country as an  illegal  immigrant  and  become  a
burden to the country than to come into the country  as  a  legal  immigrant
and be an asset to the country.

Our people - and I am now speaking especially of the  Eastern  Cape  and  in
particular of Port Elizabeth - complain that especially  immigrants,  and  I
am going to mention the country's name, from Senegal are  making  the  lives
of  South  Africans  difficult  and  are  also   taking   away   their   job
opportunities. These people, amongst other things, are also  street  vendors
and sell inferior imitations of known brand name products  at  prices  which
are competitive with the real McCoy.
Many of them are also unemployed and in the central part of  Port  Elizabeth
they have cordoned off a part which  they  regard  as  their  country  where
their country's laws apply. The police has informed  me  that  as  the  SAPS
they are not allowed there. They are not allowed to  enter.  Crime  such  as
drug trafficking and so forth reign supreme. Our police officers  have  been
so demoralised that they cannot execute their  duties  in  a  dedicated  and
serious manner any longer. I am saying these things because the police  from
the Humewood station in Port Elizabeth asked  me  to  say  this  in  public.
[Interjections.] Them!

These illegal immigrants from Senegal are also,  according  to  the  police,
the criminals who are connected with the large-scale cellphone thefts  which
are now the order of the day in the city. These people have  perfected  this
type of theft to an absolute artform.

I can attest to this, because I have also been on the wrong  side  of  their
clever stealing ability. The police did  not  hesitate  for  one  moment  to
blame the theft on the Senegalese who are in  the  country  illegally.  They
usually operate in pairs or as a threesome, and mainly target  the  shopping
centres and beaches.

Although many amendments have been proposed by both the  ANC  and  the  IFP,
the select committee  of  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  decided  to
approve the legislation as it was  debated  and  approved  in  the  National
Assembly. We are, however, appealing to the Minister to think  again.  There
are huge shortcomings.

There should be an opportunity to go ahead and draft an Act  which  will  be
to the benefit of the whole of South Africa. We have  already  indicated  in
the committee which clauses should be amended. I  am  not  going  to  repeat
this now. We need legislation which will keep out  the  undesirable  people,
and invite in those who are useful.]

We must get consensus and get the best for our  country.  We  have  a  great
country, that is  why  we  have  these  problems  with  illegal  foreigners.
Benjamin Franklin once said: ``Beware of little expenses, a small leak  will
sink a great ship.'' I would like to warn: One must beware of a few  clauses
in the Bill; they could sink the whole Immigration Bill.

My party supports the Bill. Let us put South Africa first. Come, let  us  do
it. Kom ons doen dit. Masenzeni njalo. Idani ri  ite-wozani  senzeni  njalo.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, hon Minister, Parliament is a  wonderful  place,
it is a consensus-seeking device. It is wonderful that we have  now  reached
consensus - that the Bill before  the  House  is  flawed  and  needs  to  be
improved. I have a feeling -  the  Minister  will  not  admit  it,  I  know,
because he is a man of integrity and a loyal man who will be  loyal  to  his
colleagues - that this Minister has been let down.

I think that the Minister  is  taking  the  rap  for  the  incompetence  and
inability of Parliament and the parties to find each other. As far as  I  am
concerned, I want to apologise to the Minister for that. I do not  think  he
deserves it. And I know that this hon Minister  knows  more  about  economic
development than most leaders in this country. There are thousands of  acres
of factories that he has bought. He understands the needs of the economy.  I
hope that in the next round hon  members  will  produce  a  Bill  which  the
Minister too will be able to be proud of.

South Africa's principal development challenge is to generate higher  levels
of productive employment for our people. In order to achieve this,  we  must
maintain a consistent level of economic growth.

South Africa is intrinsically  connected  to  the  global  process,  as  its
involvement in Africa and other parts of  the  world  indicates.  The  Nepad
initiative is all about bringing  Africa  into  a  global  society.  African
economic development and growth aim to reduce poverty  levels,  to  generate
employment opportunities and to improve democratic governance.  These  goals
are spearheaded by this country, signifying our global ambitions.
If we had managed to get the Immigration Bill right, it would have  enhanced
South Africa's position - hopefully, the future Bill will - as  a  strategic
global partner and stimulated growth, investment and job creation,  as  well
as created empowerment opportunities.

According to a study, and I quote as follows:


  ... emigration to the UK, US, New Zealand, Canada and  Australia  by  the
  Paris-based Institute for Development Research  estimated  that  233  609
  people left South Africa for these destinations between 1987 and  1997  -
  41 000 of them  professionals.  Skilled  workers  emigrating  from  South
  Africa are estimated to have cost the country R67,8 billion in lost human
  capital since 1997 and this has retarded economic growth.

According to a study done  in  mid-1997,  published  by  the  South  African
Migrant Project,  only  about  1%  of  respondents  to  that  project  cited
immigration as one of the most  important  issues  facing  this  country.  I
therefore also wish to commend Minister Alec Erwin for his  intervention  in
a  desperate  attempt  to  redress  the  quota  system  in  the  Bill.   His
intervention has failed regrettably, I suppose. But it is  regrettable  that
the majority party that brought these amendments at this late stage made  it
impossible to comply with the Constitutional Court order.

We must remember that South Africa's principal challenges are  economic  and
moral, and not of a political nature. Minister Erwin, therefore, is  correct
to call for a reassessment of the work permit, which  has  been  echoed,  of
course, by the Minister  here  today.  According  to  a  recent  article  in
Financial Mail, South Africa has a skills shortage of between  200  000  and
500 000 positions.

All around the world countries are competing  to  attract  and  recruit  the
best possible global brains and skilled workers. South Africa, on the  other
hand, seeks to restrict their influx, or, anyhow, it is the  consequence  of
our actions, even if we are not trying to do so.

There is a second fundamental reason that we in this party oppose the  Bill.
It is because of the extension of the definition of the word  ``spouse''  to
include a party to a  permanent  heterosexual  or  homosexual  relationship.
Here, once more,  the  Government  is  finessing  into  this  legislation  a
secular humanist agenda, which erodes and contradicts the basis  of  Judaeo-
Christian family values that we as Christian democrats wish  to  uphold  and
which we believe are fundamental to a healthy society.

We understand the dilemma of the Minister. He is bound by  a  Constitutional
Court decision. I know that. But he cannot be pleased to see  this  in  this
legislation. We predict that implementation of this aspect of the Bill  will
be a minefield for the Minister and will  be  fraudulently  used  to  obtain
permanent residence permits.

We are opposed to the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon Minister of Home Affairs, hon members in  this
House, one of the objectives of the Immigration Bill is to promote  a  human
rights-based culture, both in Government as well as  in  civil  society.  To
ensure that this is not only spoken, but  implemented  as  well,  this  Bill
provides for a  mechanism  in  the  form  of  permits  that  are  issued  to
foreigners.

The ANC's principal objection to  the  issuing  of  permits  was  that  this
authorised institutions in the private and public sectors to issue  permits.
By doing this, the Department of Home Affairs, we believe, was  giving  away
a fundamental Home Affairs competency to institutions that had  neither  the
capacity nor the competency to deal with the control of foreigners  entering
our country. We felt  very  strongly  that  our  country's  ports  of  entry
control would be compromised.

Allow me to talk briefly about the  different  types  of  permits  that  are
provided for in this Bill and which are issued by  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs. There are quite a number and  I  might  not  finish  talking  about
them.

I will start with work permits. The intention of  the  ANC  with  regard  to
work permits has always been twofold, namely to ensure  that  the  necessary
skills found lacking in our country  are  replaced  through  the  skills  of
foreign workers and, secondly, that the  workers  in  our  country  are  not
unfairly disadvantaged through indiscriminate issuing  of  work  permits  to
the detriment of South African workers. We believe that the manner in  which
the clause on work permits was originally constructed did not go far  enough
to accommodate these ideals.

We therefore reconstructed clause 19 in  such  a  way  that  we  would  give
impetus to these ideals. Unfortunately, time constraints  placed  on  us  by
way of the court order meant that we had to  proceed  with  this  Bill  and,
particularly, this clause at quite a rapid pace. We have already  placed  on
record that we would like to see this clause further  amended  and  we  look
forward to doing so as soon as the amending Bill is before us.
Regarding the visitor's permit,  this  type  of  permit  is  issued  by  the
department to a foreigner who holds a visa or is  a  citizen  of  a  foreign
state prescribed from time to time or providing other guarantees in  respect
of his or her departure.  Essentially,  visitors  can  come  in  even  on  a
multiple-entry permit.

Then we have the diplomatic permits. This is a delegated function  that  the
Department of Home Affairs gives  to  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs,
allowing the department to issue permits to the following: an ambassador,  a
minister of a foreign  state,  a  career  diplomat  or  councillor,  and  an
officer of a foreign government recognised by the South African Government.

Amongst the permits, the most interesting one, or the one that interests  me
most, is the retired person's permit. This clause provides for  people  from
foreign countries  to  retire  in  South  Africa.  But  this  retirement  is
conditional on the retiree's financial security for life. They  should  have
their own pensions from their country of origin payable until the  day  they
die. This means that they are not going to affect our social grants  and  so
on, which would mean that they are not a burden on  our  social  development
resources. We are encouraging them to  retire  in  our  country  while  they
contribute meaningfully to our economy.

Then we have the study permit. This  type  of  permit  is  provided  for  in
clause 13 of this Bill. Foreigners intending to study in  the  Republic  for
more than three months are issued study permits by  the  department  through
the Foreign Affairs office or a designated official  or  an  institution  of
learning where the foreigner intends to study. The institution has  to  work
with the department by providing information about the  foreign  learner  or
student. Should the institution of learning not comply  with  the  provision
of this clause, the institution will then  be  penalised,  rather  than  the
individual instructor or lecturer, for  allowing  an  illegal  foreigner  to
study at the institution.

We have the treaty permit. This is another type of permit  provided  for  by
clause 14 of this Bill. It is issued by the Department of  Home  Affairs  or
the Department of Foreign Affairs in situations  where,  for  instance,  the
foreigner conducts activities in the Republic in terms of  an  international
agreement to which the Republic is party.

We have another permit called a business permit. This allows  foreigners  to
invest finances or capital contribution in business  in  our  country.  This
clause provides for the services of a chartered accountant to  be  employed.
Those who participated in the committee  will  remember  that  we  had  some
queries about the employment of the  services  of  a  chartered  accountant.
Such a permit may be issued for more than  one  entry  to  a  foreigner,  or
multiple entry into the Republic when necessary for that person  to  conduct
business effectively.

In our discussions with  various  stakeholders,  it  became  clear  that  we
needed to adopt a fairly flexible  system  of  entry  into  our  country  to
encourage particular investors to boost our economy.
We have another permit, the  corporate  permit.  With  regard  to  corporate
permits, we were concerned that, in terms of the  original  construction  of
this Bill, corporations would  be  given  the  authority  to  issue  permits
whenever and to whomever they deemed necessary  to  employ,  in  an  ad  hoc
manner. Our concern was, firstly, that  the  potential  for  corruption  was
increased tenfold by allowing corporate entities to administer an  exclusive
Home Affairs competency.

Secondly, by giving carte blanche to large  corporations  to  issue  permits
not only would the function of Home Affairs in this regard  be  devolved  to
the private sector, but we also run the risk of the safety and  security  of
our country  being  compromised.  The  reconstruction  of  clause  21  would
essentially give corporations the right to  apply  for  a  corporate  permit
through the Department of Home Affairs, allowing large  numbers  of  workers
in at a time when our country needs those skills.

We recognise that with the brain drain a harsh reality and in  keeping  with
creating a climate that would encourage investment in our country,  we  need
to eliminate as much red tape as possible. We need to  investigate  this  in
our relation to foreigners.

There is the crew permit, the medical treatment permit -  unfortunately  one
cannot name them all.

Lastly, we have the relative permit.  Clause  18  provides  for  a  relative
permit to a foreigner who is a member of the immediate family of  a  citizen
or a resident, provided  that  such  a  citizen  or  resident  provides  the
prescribed financial assurances.

In conclusion, I would to congratulate all those who  worked  very  hard  on
this Bill. I know that in its current form it  is  not  perfect,  but  I  am
confident that it will be perfect in the near future. [Applause.]

Mnr J HORNE: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister en lede van die Huis,  dit  is
vir my 'n voorreg om deel te  neem  aan  die  bespreking  oor  die  omstrede
wetsontwerp oor immigrasie.
Hierdie wetsontwerp het  'n  lang  geskiedenis  van  bykans  agt  jaar,  wat
gekenmerk is deur misverstande, weglatings en byvoegings.  Die  belangrikste
beginsel wat in dié wetsontwerp vervat is, is soos volg:  om  die  koms  van
vreemdelinge na, hul verblyf in, en vertrek uit ons land te reguleer.

Daar is gepoog om sover moontlik aan hierdie verwagtings te voldoen. Tog  is
daar vele leemtes in die  wetsontwerp.  Alhoewel  geen  wetgewing  heeltemal
waterdig is nie, sal daar so spoedig moontlik in die  nabye  toekoms  aandag
aan hierdie gebreke geskenk moet word.

Die wetsontwerp maak ook voorsiening om geskoolde mense na die land te  lok,
wat kan meehelp om  die  baie  ongeskoolde  Suid-Afrikaners  op  te  lei  en
sodoende  entrepreneurskap  te  vestig  en  werkloosheid  te   verlig.   Die
uitreiking van sake- en werkpermitte sal beslis 'n voordelige uitwerking  op
ons ekonomie hê. Dit sal ook gepas wees om weer te kyk na  die  kwotastelsel
in die wetsontwerp.  Ook  sal  dit  wenslik  wees  dat,  wanneer  regulasies
uitgevaardig word, die openbare mening in ag  geneem  sal  word.  Daar  word
staatgemaak op die Minister se oop gemoed.

Of hierdie wetgewing tot sy reg sal kom, sal afhang van die mate waarin  die
departement daarin sal slaag om daaraan beslag te gee. Prakties beteken  dit
dat die departement sy personeel sal moet oplei  om  die  wetgewing  te  kan
toepas. Tesame daarmee sal die departement voorsiening  moet  maak  vir  die
nodige fondse vir die opleiding van personeel.

Ten slotte wil ek die vorige voorsitter van  die  portefeuljekomitee  bedank
vir sy bydrae. Hy het die ys gebreek. Aan die nuwe voorsitter kan ek  sê  hy
het die afrondingswerk gedoen. Ek rig ook 'n spesiale  woord  van  dank  aan
die voorsitter van die gekose komitee, me Jacobus.  Sy  het  'n  reusebydrae
gelewer in die totstandbrenging van die wetsontwerp. Laastens, maar nie  die
minste nie, 'n woord van dank aan die personeel van die  departement.  Hulle
was daagliks op hul pos  om  vrae  te  beantwoord.  Dit  het  nie  ongesiens
verbygegaan nie.
Ek rig ook 'n spesiale woord van dank aan die agb  Minister,  dr  Buthelezi.
Hy het groot staatsmanskap aan die  dag  gelê  deur  sy  erkenning  van  die
hoogste hof in die land  met  die  aanvaarding  van  die  wetgewing  met  sy
gebreke. Sy optrede herinner aan die  woorde  van  die  skrywer  Longfellow:
``Die leiers op die hoogste trap, het nie gestyg met enkele stap. Wyl  ander
slaap en droom, het hul gewerk tot oggendsoom.''

So is daar ook hier gewerk. Die Nuwe  NP  steun  die  wetgewing.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and members of the House, it is  a
privilege for me to participate in this debate on the controversial Bill  on
immigration.

This Bill has a long history of almost eight  years,  one  characterised  by
misunderstandings, omissions and additions.  The  most  important  principle
contained in this Bill is  the  following:  to  regulate  the  admission  of
foreigners to, their residence in, and departure from our country.

As far as possible, an attempt has been made  to  meet  these  expectations.
However, there are still many deficiencies in  this  Bill.  Even  though  no
legislation is completely watertight, we  will  have  to  pay  attention  to
these deficiencies as soon as possible, in the foreseeable future.

This Bill also makes provision for attracting skilled people to our  country
who can assist in training the many unskilled South  Africans  and  in  this
way establish entrepreneurship and alleviate unemployment.  The  issuing  of
business permits and work  permits  will  definitely  have  an  advantageous
effect on our economy. It would also be appropriate to take a fresh look  at
the quota system in the Bill. It would also be preferable, when  regulations
are promulgated, for public  opinion  to  be  taken  into  account.  We  are
relying on the Minister's open mind.

Whether this legislation will come into its own will depend  on  the  extent
to which the department will succeed in giving effect  to  it.  Practically,
this means that the department will have to train its  staff  to  apply  the
legislation. Coupled with this, the department will have to  make  provision
for the necessary funds for the training of staff.

In conclusion I  would  like  to  thank  the  previous  chairperson  of  the
portfolio committee for his contribution. He  broke  the  ice.  To  the  new
chairperson I would like to say that he made the finishing touches.  I  also
extend a special word of thanks to the chairperson of the select  committee,
Ms Jacobus. She made an enormous contribution to the  establishment  of  the
Bill. Last but not least, a word of thanks to the staff of  the  department.
They were at their  posts  daily  to  answer  questions.  This  did  not  go
unnoticed.

I also direct a  special  word  of  thanks  to  the  hon  the  Minister,  Dr
Buthelezi. He displayed great statesmanship  by  acknowledging  the  highest
court in the land through the acceptance of the  legislation  including  its
deficiencies. His actions remind one of the words of the writer  Longfellow:
``The heights by great men reached and kept  were  not  attained  by  sudden
flight. But they, while their companions slept, were toiling upward  in  the
night.''

That is how we also worked  here.  The  New  NP  supports  the  legislation.
[Applause.]]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  members  of  this  august
House, the Bill before this House has  been  a  subject  of  intense  debate
between political parties and the Department of Home Affairs.  In  my  three
years' experience as an MP, no other Bill has been interrogated as  much  as
this one. The true situation is that even on the  day  of  its  finalisation
there were still amendments lined up for tabling  in  an  attempt  to  reach
consensus, especially on clause 19, dealing with the quota system.  However,
the parties ultimately agreed to withdraw the proposed  new  amendments  and
rather to move towards meeting the constitutional deadline.

The select committee was confronted by  two  problems.  The  first  one  was
whether to deal with the proposed amendments  and  thus  fail  to  meet  the
constitutional deadline and, of course, to be  in  contempt  of  court.  The
consequences of such a failure would, in the opinion of  the  committee,  be
too enormous  to  contemplate.  On  the  other  hand,  the  committee  could
finalise and recommend the Bill for adoption as it  is,  and  be  castigated
and ridiculed by the press as having acted as a rubber stamp.  However,  the
latter option was, to us, the lesser of two evils,  hence  our  support  for
the adoption of the Bill with the full understanding that  a  request  would
be directed to the hon the Minister to forward an amending Bill as a  matter
of urgency.

One needs to comment that there is a huge gulf separating us, the  political
parties, from one another and that we have not yet learnt to  do  to  others
as we  would  like  them  to  do  to  us.  This  weakness  holds  disastrous
consequences for our fledgling democracy, unless it is nipped in the bud.

Coming back to the Bill, it is noted  that  clause  57  in  respect  of  the
monitoring of borders and law enforcement has been left out. However,  there
is no indication of any request by any political party for its  elimination.
It is assumed that it was left out in error. It is  some  of  these  clauses
that need urgent amendment by the department.

Furthermore, there are some other clauses, too many  to  mention  within  my
time allocation, that are viewed  by  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  as
making implementation of the proposed Act difficult. It is hoped  that  such
issues will also be taken up, as was suggested by  the  chairperson  of  the
select committee in her closing remarks yesterday.

The UCDP could  not  agree  more  with  her  ruling  on  this  matter,  and,
regardless of who says what, the ruling of the NCOP is the  best  under  the
circumstances, and we support the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon Minister of Home Affairs  and  hon  members,
from the very beginning of the committee process  on  the  Bill,  it  became
very clear that it would not  be  an  easy  and  pleasant  process  at  all,
considering the various inputs made during the public  hearing  phase.  Some
presentations were very strong on human rights issues  and  some  very  firm
and explicit on labour rights and protection, while some  expressed  serious
reservations on matters relating to business and economic growth.

All these matters raised by stakeholders were genuine and quite  legitimate.
It therefore required a committee process through which  the  Department  of
Home Affairs and members would fully  apply  their  minds  in  a  sense  and
manner so extraordinary that it would be beyond reproach  and  above  party-
political considerations. Such an approach would give room  for  discussions
and contributions that would all work towards what  would  be  in  the  best
interests of the  country,  taking  on  board,  as  much  as  possible,  the
recommendations  of  stakeholders,  a  give-and-take  situation  that  would
culminate in a workable and implementable piece of  legislation  that  would
serve a useful purpose for the department and the country.

I am not suggesting that the  committee  process  did  not  accommodate  the
sentiments that I have expressed above, but the negative  public  and  media
comments that keep flowing, as well as the concerns  expressed  by  the  hon
the Minister of Home Affairs and other speakers in the National Assembly  on
17 May 2002 and by hon members in this House today indicate  that  not  much
was achieved in the direction  of  reducing  any  differences  and  opposing
views.

It is the UDM's view,  therefore,  that  this  Bill,  which  is  notoriously
termed controversial  and  flawed,  required  enough  time  to  work  on  it
thoroughly,  at  least  to  the  greater  satisfaction  of   most   of   the
stakeholders. Well, of course, it is not always humanly possible to  satisfy
everybody and to reasonably satisfy the Department of  Home  Affairs,  which
is the ultimate and primary implementing agent of this law.

However, it could not be. On Tuesday 21 May 2002, the select  committee  had
to contend with a detailed 13-page submission  by  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs, in yet another  effort  to  put  its  case  for  the  committee  to
consider when voting on the Bill. Then the ANC and later the  IFP  submitted
further proposed amendments to the hotly contested clause 19  of  the  Bill,
which deals with the quota work permit.

Whereas the joint committee session took days to sort  out  the  amendments,
the select committee was expected to take one  day  only  to  do  this.  The
abovementioned situation, which the UDM considered awkward,  will  therefore
explain why the UDM supported, in the select committee  meeting  on  22  May
2002, the proposal that all the amendments that had been placed  before  the
committee be withdrawn and that the committee proceed to vote on  the  Bill,
subject to the committee's firm proposal  that  the  Home  Affairs  Ministry
should  immediately  restart  a  comprehensive  amendment  process  on   the
contested issues that would give all of us ample opportunity  to  reconsider
the Bill and thus be able to produce a  law  that  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs and the nation would be proud of.

The one in front of us is not a very good of  piece  of  legislation.  There
can be no claim that policy issues regarding this Bill were ironed out.  The
UDM raised its objections to a number of clauses  in  the  Bill  during  the
joint stage of discussions. There is no need for  me  to  detail  them  now,
because the UDM's  wish  is  that  this  law  should  be  referred  back  to
Parliament for the relevant and necessary changes, or  amendments,  as  soon
as it is possible for the department to do so.

On the above grounds, the UDM supports the passage of the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister of Home Affairs and  colleagues,
the  IFP  voted  against  clauses  in  the  Immigration  Bill   which   were
substantially  changed  in  the  National  Assembly  from  what   had   been
introduced by Cabinet. Some such clauses introduced a quota  system  as  the
framework to determine  which  foreigners  were  entitled  to  receive  work
permits.

The IFP has made a great investment in contributing to a process  of  policy
formulation in immigration law, which could secure something that works  for
South Africa. There is unanimous consensus that we need  a  new  and  better
system of migration control to correct the  bureaucratic  impairments  which
now prevent or deter needed foreigners from coming to South Africa. We  have
not yet opened up to the world and we still have a very insular mindset.  We
have this notion that we want to keep our  doors  closed,  while  the  world
around  us  is  changing  through  an  unprecedented  phenomenon  known   as
globalisation, which, for the first time in history, is bringing  the  whole
of mankind closer together  in  spite  of  national  boundaries.  We  wanted
something which could work for South Africa and in which South Africa  could
take pride.

We took pride in what  our  Minister  had  tabled  in  Parliament  with  the
concurrence of Cabinet. It was a modern Bill designed for the 21st  century.
At its core lay the proposal  that  one  would  rely  on  market  forces  to
determine which  foreigners  are  needed  in  South  Africa.  We  know  that
Minister Buthelezi had explained this system to many foreign  countries  and
at many international  conferences  and  received  worldwide  accolades  and
recognition for it.

We are very distressed that in a matter of a few days,  without  any  notice
or consultation with anyone, it was sprung on South Africa out of  the  blue
that we  need  to  have  a  quota  system.  In  the  many  years  of  policy
formulation there has never been any suggestion that we would end up with  a
quota system. After the adoption of  this  quota  system  by  the  portfolio
committee, there was unanimous consensus in the  media  and  public  opinion
that a quota system could not work. The department itself  came  to  us  and
told us that the quota system could not work.

The ANC proposed in the select committee to scrap the quota system, and  the
IFP supported its proposal, suggesting that we revert to  what  Cabinet  had
approved. The ANC and the IFP had the opportunity to fix what was wrong  and
go back to the original proposal. However, in the end, the ANC decided  that
no amendments would be made to the Bill.

There is also consensus that what was  approved  in  the  National  Assembly
contains many flaws, including a  number  of  technical  and  administrative
deficiencies, highlighted for us by the Department of Home Affairs. The  ANC
chose to ignore these problems, which we could have fixed just by  accepting
the good faith with which the department was bringing real problems  to  our
attention. We should have endorsed its proposals.

The NCOP has failed to capture the historic opportunity to assert  its  role
as a Chamber in which problems in legislation can  be  corrected  through  a
real and hard second look at what is adopted in the  National  Assembly.  We
are left with a feeling of being a rubber stamp. This feeling is  compounded
by the request made by the Minister to amend the Act after  it  is  adopted,
inviting the Minister to fix the mistakes that the ANC itself recognised  it
made when it introduced the quota system.

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, will the hon member take a  question  during  or
after her speech?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I am not prepared to take  any  questions.  I
am making a speech.

I feel that  parliamentary  democracy  has  proven  its  weakness.  The  ANC
amended the Bill merely because it could  not  accept  that  what  had  been
introduced by Minister Buthelezi was right. It created  confusion  with  its
amendments. It did not even feel the necessity  to  consult  the  department
and now it  ends  up  asking  Minister  Buthelezi  to  bring  in  additional
legislation to fix the problems it created. The department tabled before  us
many pages of real technical  and  administrative  concerns  raised  by  the
redrafted Bill, but we did not discuss them.

As a member of our Parliament I am very saddened by  all  this.  I  wish  to
thank  Minister  Buthelezi  and  the  department  for  their  patience   and
endurance and for their dedication and  availability  at  all  times.  As  a
nurse, I wish them strength in  determining  how  many  foreign  nurses  and
doctors  South  Africa  needs  and  the  quotas  for  each  of  their   many
specialisations and possible permutations in health facilities.

IFP supports the Bill on the Table. We have explained everything we  do  not
like in this Bill; we explained everything. Shenge's skills and wisdom  have
produced a good Bill for South Africa. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  call  upon
the hon B J Tolo to address the House. I hope  that  his  cellphone  is  off
this time, because otherwise we will confiscate it. [Laughter.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, I can assure you that it  is  off  and  that  what
happened the other time was a mistake.

Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, migration is  a  natural  phenomenon
that cannot be stopped by anyone. It is so  because  any  country  has  both
pull and push factors,  but  these  are  not  of  equal  strength,  as  some
countries may have stronger pull factors than others and vice versa.

The immigration laws that apartheid South Africa  passed  sought  to  negate
this objective phenomenon. That administration passed laws  which  made  our
country selectively permeable to people who wanted to immigrate. Only  those
they thought were on the same ideological plane  as  them  were  allowed  to
come in. The ruling party then said in no uncertain terms that  it  did  not
want the minds of South Africans to be contaminated or polluted  with  ideas
alien to and different from those that they themselves propagated.

That epoch-making event, the 1994 elections in South Africa, managed to  put
apartheid in its rightful place: the  museum  of  history,  along  side  the
spinning wheel. It meant that as South Africans we had to chart a  new  path
for ourselves - a path based on  democratic  principles  as  recognised  and
embraced by the whole of progressive mankind.

We had and we have no illusion that the struggle to build a new  society  is
adorned with roses. It is because we know that apartheid  not  only  survive
through the use of brutal force,  but  also  by  relying  on  a  network  of
administration, which administered all the reactionary laws which kept  them
in power for so many decades.

Transformation, therefore, not  only  means  changing  the  mindset  of  the
bureaucracy, but also overhauling in a fundamental way  all  the  oppressive
laws which were meant to exclude, and in their place to put those  that  are
progressive and inclusive. What we are engaged in today is  but  the  laying
of another brick in that arduous process of building a new  society  on  the
ruins of the old one.

We want to agree with  the  assertion  that  immigration  policy  is  a  key
component of social and economic development in our country  and  indeed  in
any country. It is a policy that is difficult to elaborate on and  it  needs
to be carefully considered, for if we falter we will get unintended  results
to the detriment of our country, and we will be  judged  harshly  by  future
generations.

The Bill before us, with all the inaccuracies, is a genuine attempt  by  the
Department of Home Affairs to address  and  establish  a  sound  immigration
policy for our country. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the  establishment
of an advisory board. We are happy with the composition of the board  as  it
is made up of representatives of both  civil  society  and  Government.  Its
functions are clearly stated, in  that  it  advises  the  Minister  and  the
department on matters relating to immigration alone.

The department needs  to  be  very  careful  that  this  board  resists  the
temptation of becoming a monster with tentacles like an octopus,  to  engulf
the entire department. We further  want  to  submit  that,  for  the  smooth
running of the board, one cannot have anyone other than the  chairperson  of
the board convening board meetings. But, of course, we  want  to  hasten  to
say that the  Minister  or  the  director-general  in  that  department  can
convene board meetings, in the sense that if  the  Minister  would  want  to
discuss something with the board or would want the board to  advise  him  on
something, the Minister can consult with the chairperson  and  instruct  him
or her to call a meeting, rather than the Minister himself or the  director-
general convening the board directly.

Departments do from time to time,  depending  on  prevailing  circumstances,
review their own organisational structures and adopt new ones, if  need  be.
This  is  regulated  by  the  Public  Service  Act  and   other   Government
procedures. This is to ensure  uniformity  in  Government  departments  with
regard to norms and standards.
It is our view, therefore, that  it  will  not  be  correct  to  squeeze  in
departmental restructuring in a law that deals with only one aspect  of  the
department's functions. One should bear in mind that so far there are  about
13 or 14 pieces of legislation, I  am  sure,  that  have  to  do  with  that
department, and of all those pieces of legislation that were passed,  not  a
single one of them included the restructuring  of  the  department.  We  are
therefore saying that this one must be the same as all other laws that  were
passed  in  respect  of  that  department  and  should   not   include   the
restructuring of the department. That can be done elsewhere.

Once Government allows one department not to comply with the  provisions  of
the Public Service Act and the Labour Relations  Act,  then  this  piece  of
legislation will not be worth the paper it is written on, and  may  just  as
well be thrown out the window. There will  be  no  norms  and  standards  in
Government, and I do not think this is what we want. We are, however,  happy
that the final  Bill  placed  before  this  House  does  not  entertain  the
departmental organogram.

Section 49 of  the  Bill  provides  for  different  offences  which  can  be
committed  by  illegal  foreigners  and  even  South  African  citizens   in
contravention of this law.

It further provides for upper ceilings of sentences that can  be  served  on
an offender. It avoids stipulating  monetary  equivalents  to  those  prison
sentences,  as  these  might  be  restrictive  to  magistrates,  given   the
fluctuating and rising inflation rate in this country. Over and above  this,
the Adjustment of Fines Act  of  1991  seeks  to  allow  the  Department  of
Justice to adjust fines, from time to time, in  accordance  with  inflation,
to allow for uniformity in fines. We therefore agree  fully  with  the  Bill
being silent on these fines.

We agree with the Bill in clause  33,  that  there  should  be  inspectorate
units rather than investigation units in the department. Our  view  is  that
if we talk of investigation units, one implies that one  has  a  network  of
informers and other auxiliary structures, such as intelligence units,  which
would support such investigations. Informers and intelligence  units  belong
elsewhere in Government, and not in Home Affairs.

In conclusion, we want  to  commend  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  for
placing this Bill  before  Parliament,  a  Bill  which,  unlike  the  Aliens
Control Act, which is outdated and unconstitutional,  is  humane  and  human
rights orientated.

Before I sit down, I just  want  to  say  something  with  regard  to  those
amendments that we as ANC actually withdrew. We want to  assure  this  House
that we withdrew those amendments not because we no longer believe in  them,
as other people have stated. We withdrew them because we felt that we  would
not be in time for this piece of legislation to be passed  and  assented  to
by the President. The hon the Minister said in the  National  Assembly  that
he agreed with this Bill, because if he were to withdraw it,  we  would  not
be able to meet the deadline.  So,  it  is  in  that  spirit  that  we  also
withdrew those amendments. It is not that we  are  throwing  them  away.  We
withdrew them temporarily, and, therefore, to harp on and lament  the  quota
system is but playing to the gallery. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson and hon members,  for  the  record
of this House, let me reiterate  something  that  I  said  in  the  National
Assembly. Just to remind people, and just for the record of the NCOP,  I  am
in  this  Government,  because,  first  of  all,  the  interim  Constitution
prescribed that any party that had more than 5%  could  have  representation
in Government. When Mr Mandela invited me, I agreed to do so.  Some  members
of the IFP and some of the ANC did not like it. But both of  us  thought  it
was in the interests of the country that I should accept it, after  the  war
that took place between the ANC and the IFP,  in  which  more  than  20  000
people were killed. Let me make this very clear to hon  members,  because  I
think some of them have forgotten that.

Now, this Government of National  Unity  then  expired  in  1999.  The  then
Deputy President Mbeki, who was the  president  of  the  ANC  at  the  time,
called me to his  office  in  that  capacity.  He  then  said  that  in  the
interests of reconciliation he thought we should continue to work  together,
even if it was no longer prescribed by the new Constitution. I agreed to  do
so. He said he was going to go even further and requested that,  if  he  was
elected, as it was taken for granted he would  be,  he  would  make  me  his
Deputy President, also to  consolidate  reconciliation.  I  agreed  in  that
spirit, not because I wanted to be Deputy President.

But, in fact, when there was a caveat or a condition  that,  if  I  accepted
it, I must hand over the premiership of KwaZulu-Natal to the ANC,  then,  of
course, I could not accept that. But still we agreed  with  President  Mbeki
that I should continue to work. So, I said:  I  agree  Mzizi,  give  me  any
portfolio. President Mbeki refused and said  to  me  that  I  was  a  senior
Minister and he could not just give me any position. I was the leader  of  a
minority party  in  the  Government  and,  therefore,  on  the  day  of  his
inauguration, I was waiting for the function in the  evening  when  a  phone
call came through to say that he was asking me to go back to Home Affairs.
Now, I made remarks, not to the same extent that I  am  doing  here,  but  I
think I should do so, because to many of  us  it  is  quite  admirable  that
there is Nepad today and it is led by our President, Mr Mbeki, and there  is
talk of an African Renaissance, and it is led by him.

Just recently there was a dialogue at Sun City concerning the DRC  in  which
our President participated. Now, I must say,  of  course,  people  must  not
forget that here at home we have managed to do  the  wonderful  things  that
our President is doing because I agreed, my party agreed, and the  ANC  felt
strongly that we should work together.

Now, this legislation has been worked on for years. It followed the  process
of the Green Paper, the White Paper - it has been going on for a long  time.
And also, when the matter came before  the  Cabinet  committee,  our  Deputy
President Zuma was presiding, and on that day  discussions  took  place  for
three hours. He said he had never seen, since he  came  from  KwaZulu-Natal,
where he had been Minister of Economic Affairs,  any  piece  of  legislation
discussed in committee for three hours.

Then, after that, it came before Cabinet and we spent more than an  hour  in
the Cabinet meeting. As if that was not sufficient, we also had  a  workshop
of Cabinet  for  several  hours,  including  the  President  and  Ministers,
discussing the Bill.

If these walls could speak! In this very Chamber,  I  had  a  conference  to
which all the stakeholders were  invited  to  discuss  this  Bill.  All  the
people - even Cosatu, in fact - helped me with some  money  to  finance  the
workshop. I am just illustrating that even the trade unions as well  as  all
the other stakeholders  were  greatly  involved.  We  had  discussions  with
Nedlac and with all stakeholders.

I think when people become so critical  they  should  not  forget  that  the
process has been very long and very thorough. Yesterday,  members  saw  that
one of the  newspapers  mentioned  that  this  was  Buthelezi's  Bill.  Yes,
because I am the line function Minister, maybe it is Buthelezi's  Bill,  but
once it goes  through  the  Cabinet  and  is  brought  to  members  here  in
Parliament, it is no longer Buthelezi's Bill.

But maybe this is the beginning of the problem, that when  it  was  seen  as
Buthelezi's Bill, Buthelezi was seen in it, and it was  like  waving  a  red
rag in front of a bull. For no rhyme or reason,  molehills  were  made  into
mountains in order to oppose as much as possible.

I would like to say that I am talking about a very  serious  thing  for  our
country. There has been peace in KwaZulu-Natal, which was a theatre  of  war
between the IFP and the ANC in the last eight  years.  But,  in  fact,  some
political killings are taking place in KwaZulu-Natal even  now.  Even  today
there is an  unnamed  place  where  ANC  and  IFP  leaders  are  engaged  in
discussions.

People must realise that simmering underneath will not  manage  to  put  out
all the fires that destroyed so many of our people. It may be good  to  slap
down a leader of a minority party in the sense that he is the  leader  of  a
minority party, but we may not have all the beautiful things  that  we  have
now for long. The investments that we want for our country, if  we  had  not
managed what we managed with Mr Mandela first of all and  are  now  managing
with President Mbeki, would not be hailed as an example  to  Africa  and  to
the world.

I would like to thank the chairperson of the Select Committee,  Ms  Jacobus,
for her remarks. I will not reiterate what the hon member said,  but  I  did
comment in my main presentation on the select committee's  suggestion,  that
I bring the necessary amendments so that this matter can be put right.

Judging by the remarks that were made by the hon member Mr Tolo,  one  would
never think that this Bill came before Cabinet  and  that  in  the  Cabinet,
each department has experts and legal  people.  In  fact,  our  Minister  of
Justice, Dr Maduna, has a doctorate in law. There were all those people  who
scrutinised this Bill, and in spite of that it took so long when it  was  in
front of them. These people were there.

This Bill has made history. Maybe some members need to be reminded that  the
Bill was not certified by the  state  but  by  Adv  Gauntlett.  I  saw  some
dragging of feet which was inexplicable to me. There was a  reluctance  even
to certify this Bill, which I could not understand. That is  why  I  had  to
ask an outside lawyer, Adv Gauntlett, to certify the Bill.  All  the  people
who have been pontificating about the Bill's  constitutionality  and  so  on
have amazed me, because everyone in this country knows who Jeremy  Gauntlett
is, and he is the one who certified the Bill.

As I said, even in the National  Assembly  there  is  a  separation  between
Cabinet and legislature, and it is hon members' prerogative and right to  do
whatever they think proper, as the legislature of  this  country,  regarding
whatever we, as Cabinet,  bring  down  to  the  legislature.  So  I  am  not
questioning that, but I am talking about the  process.  Why  should  someone
like me, who decided to work with my party as a minority  party  in  an  ANC
Government, be  doubted?  When  the  hon  member  Mr  Tolo  talks  about  an
investigating unit, there will be suspicions.
I must remind the hon member that the Director-General of Home Affairs is  a
former Director-General of the SA Secret Service. I must remind him that  my
former Deputy Minister of Home Affairs  is  Minister  Sisulu,  who  was  the
chairperson of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. I  must  remind
the hon Mr Tolo that my present Deputy Minister,  Ms  Mapisa-Nqakula,  is  a
former chairperson of  the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence.  I
therefore really do not understand  the  point  that  is  being  made  about
investigations when we  have  all  those  intelligence  heavyweights  in  my
department. I would like to thank the hon member Ms Gouws as  well  for  her
contribution. All I would add is that the main effort of  the  Bill  was  to
focus more resources on enforcement. The hon Mr  Tolo  made  a  point  about
restructuring merely to make it easier in the first place for people to  get
permits to break down the bureaucracy. But, above everything  else,  we  are
decentralising precisely in order to concentrate on  enforcement,  which  is
what we should be doing, considering the problems that we are now facing.

I would also like to thank the hon Mrs Nkuna and say that the  objective  of
the original version of the Bill was emphatically to add to economic  growth
and the creation of job opportunities. To a certain extent in  reverting  to
official discretion and widening discretion we  have,  in  my  humble  view,
lost ground. My aim was that the advisory board should rather be  executive,
because there are many entities like  that  in  all  departments  which  are
autonomous and so on, but my colleagues in the Cabinet felt that  it  should
merely be advisory, and I bowed to that and accepted it.  By  the  time  the
Bill came here it was also my view that it should be advisory.

Regarding the concern that was expressed by the hon member Mrs  Nkuna  about
the corporate permit, that never existed. It was merely  a  control  process
which simply relieved the department of unnecessary tasks.

I thank the hon member Mr Horne for what he said about me, and so on, and  I
think my preliminary remarks did answer what he said. In  the  same  vein  I
would like to thank the hon Ambassador Durr for what he said about the  fact
that we may differ in politics from party  to  party.  We  may  differ  even
within a party, as there are various viewpoints in any party, whether it  is
the ANC or the IFP, and there are various  formations  in  a  party.  Having
said all that, I do not think that there  is  anyone  who  should  doubt  my
sincerity and integrity.

I would like to thank also the hon member  Mr  Sogoni,  who  said,  rightly,
that it was clear from the outset that this would be a difficult process.  I
remember when I introduced  this  Bill  before  the  Cabinet.  I  said  that
immigration  in  any  country  was  a  controversial  matter.  I  said  that
immigration would be controversial until the second  coming  of  Christ.  My
colleagues laughed, but I meant that. If anyone doubts that, they must  look
at what happened in Holland now with the killing of Mr Fortuyn on this  very
issue. They must also look at what happened in Paris a few weeks  back  with
Le Pen, which is also based on this issue of immigration. There  is  nothing
exceptional about this.

In any country this is a very controversial thing. I can assure hon  members
that I had this Bill with me  when  I  went  to  Washington  and  talked  to
officials there. I had this Bill with me when  I  talked  to  colleagues  in
Rotterdam, Holland. It was hailed everywhere. Mr Ruddock,  the  Minister  of
immigration in Australia and my colleagues and  other  Ministers  in  Geneva
also hailed this Bill.

I am very grateful for the fact  that  in  the  interests  of  the  country,
therefore, we have all agreed, as members indicated in their  presentations,
that this Bill should be passed for  now,  in  the  same  vein  in  which  I
proposed this in the National Assembly, in order to meet the deadline. I  do
not want to pick a fight with any particular person,  but  there  were  some
contributions that, with due respect, were expressed  concerning  this  Bill
that surprised me, seeing what was published in the papers of yesterday  and
today. Even hon Minister  Erwin  personally  tried  to  intervene,  so  that
although a member was prepared to put on  the  backburner  the  issue  about
quotas, there was a member who, for the sake of debate, tried to defend  it,
which surprised me.

I have only just been assured by the chairperson  of  the  select  committee
that I need to bring amendments so that this thing  can  be  put  right.  It
boggles the mind. I cannot understand it.

I may be the leader of the IFP, a minority party  in  the  Government  which
works with the majority party, the ANC. I may be that.  Having  said  so,  I
have operated under either President Mandela  or  President  Mbeki,  not  so
much as the leader of the IFP, but as a Minister of state.  It  is  in  that
spirit that I have endured what I have endured so that  this  process  could
be finalised by hon members here today. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 15:47.
