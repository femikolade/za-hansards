                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 15 - Education:

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson,  hon  members,  it  is  tempting  to
repeat the speech I delivered in the National Assembly last week.  Similarly
it is tempting  to  identify  the  problems  and  pathologies  in  different
provinces and each school. But my  duty  today  is  to  concentrate  on  the
relationship between the national and provincial  departments  of  education
and to examine how the provinces carry  out  their  constitutional  mandate.
Also, rather than looking at  micro  specific  issues,  I  will  provide  an
overview of what has been achieved in the past year  and  identify  some  of
the  challenges  the  provinces  face   in   the   implementation   of   our
transformation agenda.

Let me start off, however, by drawing on the experience  of  a  country  far
way but relevant to us, Japan, in their efforts  to  spur  on  and,  indeed,
accelerate their own development, which I believe  is  instructive  for  our
context. In 1872, Japan issued its fundamental  code  of  education  through
which it sought to catch up with the West.  Their  central  strategy  as  an
underdeveloped country revolved around the commitment to ensure  that  there
would be ``no community with an illiterate  family  nor  a  family  with  an
illiterate person''. Their success is today regarded  as  one  of  the  most
spectacular in global history.

By 1910, although Japan  was  still  poorer  than  Britain  and  the  United
States, almost all its young  people  were  fully  literate  and  Japan  was
publishing more books than Britain and  more  than  twice  as  many  as  the
United States.  So  Japan's  phenomenal  economic  and  social  progress  is
largely ascribed to their success in education.

There are two important lessons to be drawn from  the  Japanese  experience.
First, it took Japan a little under 40 years to achieve  this  much  praised
level of success. We in South Africa have only  had  about  eight  years  to
build the system we have today. Our characteristically harsh  evaluation  of
our own achievements - often it is very noble to be  so  self-critical,  and
harshly so -  must  be  mediated  by  and  understood  in  relation  to  the
experience in other parts of the world.

Our achievements  in  the  last  eight  years,  from  the  abysmal  baseline
fashioned through years of apartheid, objectively  compare  very  well  with
some of the most important success stories in  global  history.  The  second
lesson to be drawn from the Japanese experience is that education is one  of
the most potent instruments for achieving sustainable national  development.
This is internationally recognised and also recognised  in  the  preparatory
work done at the Bali conference on sustainable development. So we now  have
the benefit of extensive empirical studies that provide compelling  evidence
of the critical role of education in  economic  and  social  development  in
developed and developing countries.

The Japanese experience was also important in another respect.  Although  it
was an authoritarian society then,  there  was  absolute  unity  of  purpose
across all the regions and provinces and  in  national  government.  It  was
centrally driven to ensure success.

This country's commitment to  education  is  reflected,  therefore,  in  the
proportion of national public expenditure devoted  to  education.  Following
the rapid increases in education spending  in  1996-97,  education  spending
declined between 1996-97 and 1999-2000. These  declines  were  necessary  to
stabilise education spending because there was a vast amount  of  profligacy
and inefficiency up to  then,  and  spending  which  was  unsustainable  and
limited in its impact on education quality and equity.

Last year I said in this House that the success  of  spending  stabilisation
was extremely commendable and I expressed my appreciation to  the  education
MECs for their role and achievement. I regret to see so few MECs  here  this
morning. I say today that the added significance  of  the  stabilisation  is
that it was achieved without a lowering of education quality.

During this time the education  system  achieved  greater  financial  equity
through a  number  of  measures,  including  the  improvement  of  financial
management capacity, the educator rationalisation and redeployment  process,
the  improvement  of  our  management  of  personnel  expenditure  and   the
implementation of the national norms and standards for school funding,  with
the poorer schools getting seven times as much  in  school  funding  as  the
richer schools. We managed also to achieve significant improvements  through
the introduction of new policies and laws, while maintaining  an  unstinting
focus on performance.

I am extremely pleased, therefore, that we are now  harvesting  the  benefit
of successful spending stabilisation. Education spending has been rising  in
real terms since 2000-01 when aggregate  spending  grew  in  real  terms  by
1,4%. Notably KwaZulu-Natal increased spending by  4,7%  in  real  terms  in
2000-01, although from a very  low  baseline,  with  the  Eastern  Cape  and
Northern Province also achieving strong growth at  1,5%  and  1,6%  in  real
terms respectively.

Therefore it is reassuring that this growth is being maintained in  the  new
MTEF period, 2001-02 to 2003-04, when education  spending  is  projected  to
rise by 1,7% in real terms. Real  growth  is  projected  for  KwaZulu-Natal,
Mpumalanga, the Eastern Cape and Gauteng,  while  the  North  West  and  the
Northern Cape are projected to grow at slightly lower than inflation.

After adjusting for  once-off  payments  such  as  severance  packages,  all
provinces  project  real  growth  higher  than  2,5%,   with   KwaZulu-Natal
projecting a growth of over 6% per year. This  is  a  phenomenal  change  in
orientation.

These impressive  growth  figures  are  accompanied  by  equally  impressive
improvements in spending patterns. The figures show a  significant  increase
in  capital  expenditure,  which  bears  testimony  to  the  commitment   of
provincial governments to tackle classroom  backlogs,  the  lack  of  water,
sanitation  and  electricity  and  the  shortage  of  furniture,  media  and
specialist teaching facilities at schools. Later I will  show  hon  members,
in my summing up, the extent of the  involvement  -  the  400%  increase  in
capital  expenditure  in  the  next  three  or  four  years.   Non-personnel
expenditure is set to rise by 10% per year in real terms. So we are  turning
the ship  in  the  right  direction,  allowing  for  improved  provision  of
textbooks and other learning support materials.

This overall picture is therefore very  promising.  However,  one  province,
that  of  the  Western  Cape,  under  the   previous   administration,   has
consistently stood out as  a  province  where  education  accounts  for  the
lowest percentage of  provincial  expenditure.  The  actual  expenditure  on
education as a percentage of  provincial  expenditure  for  2000-01  in  the
Western Cape was 34,9%,  compared  to  a  national  average  of  39,3%.  The
national average in provincial expenditure in  eight  provinces  was  39,3%.
The estimated education expenditure in the Western Cape  over  the  MTEF  is
34,7% for 2001-02, 34,5% for 2002-03 and 34,3% for 2003-04, compared to  the
national averages of 39% for 2001-02, 38,6% for 2002-03 and 38,3% for  2003-
04.

These  figures,  therefore,  and  particularly  the  lack  of  the  kind  of
commitment that we wanted from the previous administration, raise  questions
about the previous  administration's  commitment  to  education.  They  also
convey an even more damning indictment with respect  to  commitment  to  the
poor, to equity and to poverty eradication. It is  the  poor  who  bear  the
brunt of this lack of commitment. It is the poor who happen to be black  and
resident  in  the  Western  Cape  who  have  to  bear  the  burden  of  lost
opportunities and reduced education quality. I am  hopeful  that  under  the
new administration, this scenario will change for the next MTEF cycle.

A  country's  economic  competitiveness  is  now,  more  than  ever  before,
dependent on the existence of vibrant  institutions  to  promote  high-level
human resource development and engage in research and  development.  Without
these, some  countries  will  continue  to  operate  outside  the  knowledge
economy and therefore continue  to  occupy  unfavourable  and  uncompetitive
positions  in  the  global  economy.  The   defining   line   for   economic
competitiveness for nations today is drawn between those  nations  that  are
knowledge rich and those that are knowledge poor.

Furthermore, the context of knowledge production  is  extremely  significant
for reflecting and nurturing indigenous knowledge systems. It  is  something
that we have learned in a democracy: that we just cannot  continue  the  old
colonial system of education to provide the same kind of education  for  all
our children. The enormous contribution of, for example, African  indigenous
knowledge systems will be lost to the world, unless  we  have  credible  and
vibrant higher education institutions on the  continent  to  help  knowledge
production in context and to sustain the emergence and nurturing of a  cadre
of African intellectuals which would otherwise fail to reach critical mass.

My Ministry's efforts to transform higher  education  are  relevant  to  the
NCOP,  although  higher  education  is  a  national  function.  We  seek  to
establish a trajectory which will result in  a  system  that  can  optimally
contribute to the country's reconstruction and development. The new  system,
therefore, will comprise 21 higher education  institutions,  each  of  which
will contribute to national as well as regional development. In  addition  -
and I am very proud to announce this -  the  system  will  include  two  new
bodies, the National Institutes for Higher Education in  both  the  Northern
Cape and Mpumalanga. This exciting  innovation  will  extend  the  reach  of
higher education to provinces that do not currently have such  institutions.
I must pay special tribute to the MECs for education  and  the  premiers  of
the  Northern  Cape  and  Mpumalanga  for  their  total  support   for   the
development of the National Institutes for Higher Education.

As I mentioned  earlier,  education  is  critical  to  a  nation's  economic
development. In this regard, the further education and training  system  has
a central role to play. To this end, the Ministry  has  also  made  enormous
strides in transforming our further education and training system,  so  that
millions of our young people and adults  who  have  not  been  part  of  the
vocational stream of education will now  have  access  to  quality  learning
opportunities.

Towards the end of last year, I launched my programme for a new  institution
landscape for public further education and training colleges. In  the  short
time since then, with the enormous co-operation of the  provinces,  we  have
succeeded in reducing the  total  number  of  technical  colleges  from  152
racially  fragmented  and  largely  unresponsive  institutions  to  50.  All
further education and training colleges will now  operate  within  a  single
legal and policy  framework.  Through  new  systems  of  quality  assurance,
curriculum development, funding and governance - and I hope some of the  hon
members will play a part in the governance of these technical colleges -  we
hope to ensure that these colleges are better equipped to meet the needs  of
the community.

We will also ensure that each institution  has  the  required  capacity  for
management effectiveness and teaching  effectiveness,  and  real  curriculum
development that will take into account the needs of the local business  and
social communities and improve responsiveness to the world  of  work,  while
creating better citizens and a better life for all.  And  I  hope  that  the
older generation of people, who have been neglected up to now, will be  part
of this further education and training system.

Our programme to  transform  further  education  and  training  goes  beyond
colleges to include schools. My department is working on the development  of
a national curriculum statement for further education training Grades 10  to
12 in schools. This process will build on the principles and designs of  the
national curriculum statement for Grades R to 9 and  will  be  completed  by
March 2003. The incremental phasing  in  of  outcomes-based  education  into
Grade 10 will begin  in  2004,  heralding  the  final  phase  of  curriculum
transformation in the schooling system, which has taken nearly a decade.

In reforming the curriculum from Grade 10 to 12, we have drawn on  our  rich
experience of transforming the curriculum at lower levels of  the  schooling
system. We have now  standardised  the  content  of  education  through  the
laying down of a national curriculum statement for general  education.  This
has recently been revised to deal  with  some  of  the  problems  that  were
encountered in its earlier form, especially in regard to its complexity  and
difficulties. The new statement has been streamlined, and  there  are  clear
guidelines for teachers regarding the  development  of  learning  programmes
and the assessment of learner achievement. If the programmes are not in  the
library, I will make sure  next  week  that  they  are  put  there.  English
versions of the statement have been given to all members,  but  copies,  for
the first time, are available in all 11 languages as  well  as  in  Braille,
and members can be sent these on request.

Our successes in the schooling system go beyond education. I  am  sure  that
hon members will agree that without  doubt,  one  of  our  most  significant
achievements has been the matric results in 2001. From a starting  point  of
below 50%, only four years ago, we have improved the national pass  rate  to
above 60% for  the  first  time,  creating  a  sense  of  accomplishment  by
teachers, parents and students, all of whom play their part.

This success was not ours alone to claim. It  was  the  result  of  targeted
interventions in conjunction  with  the  provinces.  Some  provinces  showed
wonderful improvements, others less so, and we will all work  together  with
them to maintain the upward  trend.  I  am  especially  glad  that  we  have
managed to reduce the number of schools which recorded  a  0%  to  20%  pass
rate from 1 000 schools out of 7 000 to under  500,  in  the  space  of  one
year. This year, hopefully, we will have none, which  would  be  appropriate
since a school that gets 0 to 20% cannot  really  qualify  to  be  called  a
school. A school should signify pride and dignity. We cannot  educate  in  a
climate of shame and  worthlessness.  Of  course,  this  year,  we  have  an
enormous programme worth R15 million, simply to improve  maths  and  science
under the guidance of the Deputy Minister.

One of our greatest achievements, which I am particularly proud of,  is  the
extent  to  which  we  have  developed  and  advanced  those  areas  of  the
educational system which have traditionally existed  at  the  margins.  Most
significant is the provision of a preschool year for all children, which  is
being introduced in more than 2 800 community-based  sites  this  year,  all
located in areas identified by the President  for  urgent  intervention.  We
are therefore fulfilling  the  promise,  for  the  first  time  anywhere  in
history,  of  more  than  eight  years  of  a  universal  10-year  education
programme. We are fulfilling the promise that we made  more  than  10  years
ago. So much for  the  political  claims  that  we  do  not  carry  out  our
promises.

Another area is the inclusion of children with  special  educational  needs,
whether emotional, intellectual or physical. These children will  no  longer
be isolated in special schools, and  will  be  mainstreamed  into  specially
prepared schools.  We  have  rolled  out  the  programme  to  bring  in  the
thousands of young people who suffer some form of handicap  and  will  bring
them into the mainstream system.

We have also increased resources to  literacy  and  adult  education.  Adult
education centres have become institutionalised and their  programmes  focus
on relevant issues. So as to eliminate doubt, particularly on  the  part  of
those who ascribe an F plus to the department  and  Ministry,  let  me  give
them the figures. In 2000, the provinces spent R248 million  on  Abet.  Last
year it was R822 million and by 2004 it will be R1,2 billion.  In  addition,
the Government has allocated R110 million  to  the  Ikhwelo  Poverty  Relief
Project, over three years, for the establishment of 60 more adult  education
centres nationwide. We are on the way. We only  began  two  or  three  years
ago.

Chairperson, you will no doubt appreciate the budget that we are  voting  on
today.  It  is  insignificant  in  relation  to  the  national  spending  on
education, which I referred to earlier. The bulk  of  spending,  of  course,
occurs in the provinces. My own  budget,  outside  salaries,  is  only  R150
million. The provinces, of course, take the  vast  bulk  of  more  than  R50
billion  of  expenditure  on  education.  Furthermore,  given  the   complex
constitutional arrangements that we have agreed upon for the management  and
governance of education, much of our ability to turn  the  education  system
around is dependent on the provinces, which are responsible for  the  actual
implementation.
At a formal level, my primary level of intervention  in  regard  to  schools
and colleges is the development of norms and standards. I  cannot  implement
them until I get the consensus of  all  the  provincial  MECs.  One  of  the
criteria for approval is always that the new norms and standards should  not
cost more, so the possibilities are limited. But let  me  assure  the  House
that we do agree on most things, and we have taken a giant leap  forward  in
ensuring that we achieve our  mission  of  providing  high-quality  learning
opportunities to all South Africans.

I do not, however, consider myself to be a  eunuch  or,  as  described  this
morning in a journal, a tea lady. I  have  nothing  against  tea  ladies.  I
think that was very insulting, tea ladies  are  vitally  important  for  our
sustenance. On the contrary,  having  reached  an  agreement  on  particular
programmes and responsibilities, I am charged with  the  responsibility  for
monitoring  and  evaluating  the  provision  of  education  with  regard  to
constitutional and legislative requirements and  in  terms  of  agreed  upon
standards.

The Ministry has developed some  useful  instruments  for  discharging  this
mandate, including the School Register of  Needs,  whole  school  evaluation
and systemic evaluation, in which a large sample of learners  across  Grades
3, 6 and 9 will be assessed for  the  first  time.  My  monitoring  role  is
therefore critical in ensuring that our constitutional provisions  become  a
reality for all our people, and it is a role  that  I  therefore  take  very
seriously. To this end, together with  my  officials,  I  undertake  regular
visits to the provinces, and meetings  are  held  with  education  MECs  and
heads of department every six weeks.

Quarterly reports to the President on the  state  of  education,  which  are
available here, are also prepared in our efforts to monitor  the  extent  to
which the provinces are meeting  their  constitutional  obligations  in  the
implementation of national  policy.  These  reports  to  the  President  are
published  widely  and  include  information  about   selected   indicators,
including spending levels. This is not done in  a  finger-pointing  way,  or
with a view to shaming anyone. Rather they are compiled in  a  collaborative
and transparent way in order to identify the problems, like the  filling  of
posts, for example - headmasters', special teaching  and  advisors  posts  -
and to find mutual solutions to those.

The next report will be a  special  one,  timed  as  a  mid-term  review  of
progress by the national and provincial departments. Independent  evaluators
will prepare the report for me, so members can be assured  that  there  will
be no spin doctoring. For those who  have  not  become  regular  readers  of
these reports to the President, I urge them to at least to  get  a  copy  of
this report, which is due out in August.

I also reminded all provincial MECs at our meeting earlier  this  week  that
in terms of the National Education Policy Act they are  required  to  report
to me if at any stage they believe that they are not capable of meeting  the
socioeconomic requirements in  the  Constitution,  including  the  right  to
basic education. I can also remind members that if I am unable to deal  with
such a situation with the provinces, I am obliged under the  Act  to  report
this to Parliament, which will advise me on the matter. I  intend  to  carry
out my functions in this area.

Our intervention is therefore an indirect  one.  We  try  to  influence  the
provision and quality of education. We do so by  prescription  in  terms  of
access, funding, post provisioning and  so  on,  so  as  to  try  to  ensure
equitable access  to  education  across  the  country.  We  also  do  so  by
persuasion, by  encouraging  and  assisting  provinces  to  reflect  on  and
improve the quality of education.

While there are clearly a number of enormous challenges that confront us  in
our efforts to build a completely new education  system,  I  am  pleased  to
report to this House that we have made significant progress in  moving  from
apartheid education to a just and democratic order.  However,  much  of  our
success stems from the hard work performed by all those  who  work  hand  in
hand with us on this daunting but necessary journey.

In this regard I wish to pay special  tribute  to  the  MECs  and  heads  of
departments for education together with other  officials.  Our  achievements
are theirs. The Select Committee  on  Education,  under  the  leadership  of
Comrade Kgware, must also be singled out for the assistance and guidance  it
has provided and continues to provide. I  must  also  express  my  sincerest
gratitude to the Deputy Minister, Musibudi Mangena,  for  his  wise  counsel
and dedication and for the vital role that he plays in the Ministry.

I have no doubt that we will all build our education system  into  one  that
serves the needs of our society and  economy,  and  those  wonderful  little
children up there in the public gallery to whom I dedicate my  speech.  They
are our children. The future generations of South Africa  deserve  no  less.
[Applause.]

This is  a  monumental  task  which  requires  members'  support  and  their
painstaking and purposeful effort. We have experienced many  setbacks,  some
of which have  already  been  resolved  while  others  demand  more  of  our
attention. Overall we are winning for the  sake  of  the  children.  We  are
delivering on the charge to invoke education as the  key  driver  of  social
development. We will continue with our efforts,  with  members'  assistance,
until we have succeeded - one step at a  time  and  one  child  at  a  time.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Let me take the time to recognise  our
future leaders. They have come at an appropriate time in this  debate  about

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs,  hon  colleagues  from
the provinces and hon colleagues of the Council, let me start with a quote:
  Far better it is to dare mighty things to  win  glorious  triumphs,  even
  though chequered by failure, than to take rank with  those  poor  spirits
  who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they  live  in  the  grey
  twilight that knows not victory or defeat.

After 100 years of oppression and a mere three since our  second  democratic
elections we have managed to transform institutions, establish new ones  and
make them work. During our first term of  governance  in  developing  a  new
democratic society, we laid the framework for  the  future,  identified  the
possible limits and the undesirable and defined  the  values  and  ethos  by
which we seek to live and  grow.  As  a  result  we  have  done  two  things
simultaneously: maintained stability and order,  and  changed  and  promoted
the wellbeing of the least advantaged within a  rights-based  constitutional
framework.

Almost two decades ago our educational system  under  the  apartheid  regime
was in jeopardy. It was  when  our  very  own  people  started  to  mobilise
against the then Bantu education department, when they started to  introduce
Afrikaans on an equal basis with English  as  a  medium  of  instruction  in
secondary schools.
The issue, however, was not so much the introduction  of  Afrikaans  as  the
whole system  of  Bantu  education,  which  was  characterised  by  separate
schools  and  universities,  poor  facilities,  overcrowded  classrooms  and
inadequately trained teachers. Over this coming weekend we  are  celebrating
this remarkable struggle that was led by our own children and even  by  some
of us. We salute those who offered their lives to  the  liberation  struggle
in all spheres.

Today we can proudly account for the major shift which  has  unfolded  since
1994. One of the Department of Education's main  objectives  is  to  restore
values in our education system. Last year this department started a  process
of addressing the restoration  of  values,  education  and  democracy.  This
process was launched with a very  important  conference  which  our  members
attended.  Its  mandate  was  to  seek  solutions  and  strategies  for  the
promotion of equity, tolerance,  multilingualism,  openness,  accountability
and social honour in our schools. It suggested a  range  of  ways  in  which
schools could begin to promote these values.

Once we have  succeeded  in  restoring  the  moral  fibre  of  our  society,
beginning with our learners, we will be able to say with pride that  one  of
our country's milestones has been reached through our education system.

Restoring  values  in  our  schools  will  be  a  useless  exercise  if  the
department should fail to provide accessibility to institutions. I  want  to
commend the Department of Education on the strategy  that  it  has  adopted,
under the leadership of the Minister, in the restructuring  and  development
of a co-ordinated further education and training system.

Through this we will be able to provide high-quality,  accessible,  flexible
and responsive programmes and equitable  opportunities  for  learners  which
will  support  both  the  current  economic  activities  of  the   different
provinces and the new development initiatives planned.

This strategy will also assist the future  further  education  and  training
Colleges in  the  development  of  their  institutional  plans,  which  will
contribute to the growth of the further education and  training  sector  and
also  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  citizens   by   improving   their
employability.

The establishment of the further  education  and  training  institutions  in
provinces makes them accessible for our youth to improve  their  skills  for
entry into the employment market. The acquiring of skills should be  one  of
our society's major objectives. I want to motivate our  youth  to  grab  the
opportunities given to  them  and  qualify  themselves  with  the  necessary
skills. It is only through effective education that we can  build  a  better
South Africa.

Redressing the inequalities of the past during a transition period  is,  for
some of us, a painful yet very vital exercise in a new  democracy.  In  this
regard  Minister  Kader  Asmal's  department  has  correctly   handled   the
restructuring of higher education in South Africa.

In conclusion, I want to applaud the hon the Minister, the  director-general
and the rest of the department for the remarkable work  done  in  addressing
the imbalances and  the  overall  successful  transition  of  our  education
system.


  If  one  advances  confidently  in  the  direction  of  his  dreams,  and
  endeavours to live the life which he has imagined, he will  meet  with  a
  success unexpected in common hours.
[Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs and hon colleagues, no  one
should  dare  underestimate  the  gargantuan  task  of   transformation   in
education that the hon the Minister has undertaken.

It is in the terrain of education that meaningful  and  real  transformation
has to  occur.  Education  had  been  trapped  for  decades  in  a  divisive
anachronistic and ideological mode. It is therefore a tragic  commentary  to
note that when the hon  the  Minister  decided  to  merge  higher  education
institutions with specific goals  and  strategic  objectives,  he  met  with
intransigence and obstinate objections from certain elements who, let it  be
said quite bluntly from this  side,  are  placing  impediments  against  the
transformation, not on some  scholarly,  well-researched  grounds,  but  for
selfish reasons of institutional preservation.

When one is comfortably ensconced in a particular  position,  with  all  the
accoutrements of meretricious splendour, one is impervious  to  change.  The
nobler aspects of why change is necessary recede  into  insignificance.  But
we welcome the Cabinet support that the hon the Minister has  elicited  from
the executive. From our side, every strength  to  the  Minister's  elbow  in
this exercise.

In his fifth report to the President, the hon the Minister has  stated  that
the performance of provincial departments of education  in  the  utilisation
of conditional grants has not been  good.  In  my  province,  for  instance,
overcrowding in schools is still a big bugbear.

More than 29 000 schools are currently overcrowded. There is no  doubt  that
the infrastructure scenario is bleak. We ask the hon the Minister  to  wield
the big stick in ensuring that  provinces  play  their  parts  in  providing
additional classrooms, ablution facilities, electrification, potable  water,
etc. Schools that go  without  these  necessities  can  never  produce  good
results. So when  the  hon  the  Minister  tells  the  President  that  poor
performance and the use of conditional grants are unacceptable, we concur.

I wish to dwell for a moment on the parlous situation in  which  the  school
feeding schemes find themselves in KwaZulu-Natal.  In  the  Pietermaritzburg
region, some 365 schools are using the programme and 160  are  not.  In  the
Durban area those schools that  have  been  approved  are  still  not  being
attended to. In Empangeni feeding only started on 1 June  2002  -  that  is,
this month. In Newcastle only one-third of the schools  are  being  fed.  In
Ladysmith half the schools are being fed.

My information is that there is  no  proper  cohesive  arrangement  in  this
area. There is inconsistency as some schools are being paid at a rate of  R1
per child, others at 90 cents and yet others at 80  cents.  Do  we  see  the
seeds of corruption? I think we do.

I have just been faxed a  newspaper  article  that  appeared  in  The  Natal
Witness only yesterday.  It  says,  ``Parents  sack  school  head  in  fraud
case''. I am not going to read the article  in  full  but  in  substance  it
reports that a school principal has been diverting not  only  school  funds,
but also the funds for the feeding  schemes,  into  her  own  personal  bank
account. She had arranged for her brother to be one of the suppliers.

We say that this is just the tip of the iceberg, it would seem,  because  my
information is - and  recently  I  have  getting  a  lot  of  calls  on  the
nutrition programme - that there is  a  lot  of  dissatisfaction  about  the
payments and disparities between payments and about  people  who  are  being
collaborated with as far as the supplying is  concerned.  When  there  is  a
case brought to the attention of the authorities, it would  seem  that  they
are a bit slow to react. It says here, that pleas for official  action  were
allegedly ignored.

Another point that I want to comment upon is the issue of discipline in  our
schools and universities. It is with utter consternation  and  despair  that
one sees how reprehensible and thoroughly  offensive  is  the  behaviour  of
some students and learners who trash university  campuses,  defy  management
measures, flout authority and  engage  in  looting  and  theft.  Some  Cosas
members, I believe, are up in arms simply  because  some  schools  keep  the
gates locked. What is this new phenomenon that  learners  must  be  free  to
walk off school premises during school hours should they so fancy?

Surely anarchy and mayhem are  not  part  of  the  new  democracy?  In  that
respect, I will show hon members an article that an  eminent  South  African
journalist has written about this very subject. His  heading  is,  ``Student
anarchy a disgrace''. I would appeal to the Minister also  to  address  this
aspect, because all the noble efforts to  bring  quality  education  can  be
sabotaged by the very people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries.

I am not going to talk about the terrible impact of  Aids  on  our  schools,
but let me quickly read a paragraph from The Teacher magazine:


The 1999 Progress of Nations Report noted that South Africa is one of  seven
countries where the number of children orphaned  by  HIV/Aids  between  1994
and 1997 increased by more than 400%.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms Z P DLUNGWANA (Free State): Chairperson, hon Minister  and  hon  members,
it is a fact that whenever people discuss the ills  of  society  they  often
also suggest education as a solution. Even those stakeholders  who  fail  to
be actively involved in the affairs of their institutions  acknowledge  that
education is a key to a brighter future for our country.

We have, in the Free State, recently  seen  an  improvement  in  the  matric
results and overall culture of teaching and learning  in  our  institutions.
Where there are still problems, we are addressing  them  and  are  confident
that we will succeed. The Free State was able to realise an  improvement  of
6% in the matric  results  in  2001.  This  might  not  appear  much  of  an
improvement, but it is nevertheless an achievement.

We have started with a holistic intervention strategy to  help  turn  poorly
performing schools around. These are schools that have achieved a below  40%
pass rate over a period of  three  to  six  years.  This  strategy  involves
appointing people who will be called administrators, selected from our  best
schools, for a period of nine months. Their role  will  be  to  support  the
principals of these  nonperforming  schools  in  improving  their  work  and
turning the performance of their schools around.

The main intention of the whole school intervention programme is to  enhance
service delivery in schools in terms of Batho Pele principles. We will  need
sustainability of performance and capacity-building in order to turn  around
the situation in nonperforming schools and poorly managed  institutions  and
offices of the department.

Having said that, I would like to highlight a few  issues.  On  HIV/Aids,  I
would like to thank the Minister for calling the coalition  conference  that
was recently held in Midrand. The message sent out  at  the  conference  was
that there is an urgent need for us to work together in  the  fight  against
HIV/Aids and poverty.

A clear call was made to the Departments of Social Development  and  Health,
and other stakeholders,  to  assist  in  supporting  children  infected  and
affected by HIV/Aids, and in particular orphans of  this  dreadful  disease.
These children are really destitute. They leave home in the morning  without
breakfast and often do not  have  lunchboxes.  They  cannot  afford  to  buy
school uniforms or pay school fees and  are  therefore  often  ridiculed  by
their peers at school.

We hope that the joint committees that have  been  established  between  the
Departments of Education and Social Development to address the  problems  of
these children will be able to help in this regard  and  also  enable  these
children to access child support grants and foster care grants.

It is the responsibility of Government to protect  the  rights  of  children
and ensure  that  these  rights  are  upheld  by  all.  The  department  has
therefore committed itself to ensuring that children who  cannot  afford  to
pay for school fees or buy school uniforms are not excluded from  education.
We are also doing everything in our province  to  ensure  that  all  schools
adhere to this commitment.

Secondly, two years ago Minister Asmal launched the South  African  National
Literacy initiative. At that time statistics were bandied about to  showcase
the poor state of literacy in the country. Since then, there  have  been  no
updates in this regard. It needs to be made clear  where  we  are  today  in
relation to the resources allocated to this initiative. We need to know  the
extent to which this initiative has helped to improve the  quality  of  life
of our people so as to motivate those involved in the programme to carry  it
forward with even more commitment and determination.

Furthermore, the relationship between adult  basic  education  and  training
and the literacy initiative needs to be  clarified.  Otherwise  it  will  be
difficult for provinces to take this initiative forward convincingly and  to
monitor its impact.

Finally, we all agree  that  higher  education  in  our  country  should  be
restructured. Our main concern,  however,  is  that  only  previously  black
institutions seem to be expected to sacrifice their culture  and  everything
they hold dear while the previously white institutions get to lose nothing.

There is a  concern  in  this  regard  about  the  proposed  merger  of  the
University of the Free State  and  the  University  of  the  North's  Qwaqwa
campus in particular. It is believed that UFS is demanding that  some  staff
members of the Qwaqwa campus be retrenched while there is  no  similar  move
on the part of UFS. This gives  the  impression  that  there  is  no  merger
between the two institutions, but rather that the  Qwaqwa  campus  is  being
incorporated into or swallowed by UFS.

While we accept that  the  merging  of  institutions  is  essential  to  the
restructuring of higher education and that  nothing  should  be  allowed  to
stand in the way of this restructuring,  we  should,  however,  be  cautious
that we do not make black institutions feel that  they  are  the  only  ones
expected to make a sacrifice in this regard.

In this example of staff retrenchments, it would be proper and just for  the
two institutions to first merge and thereafter  for  an  assessment  of  the
collective  staff  of  the  two  institutions  to  be  made  in   terms   of
qualifications, capacity, skills,  experience  and  so  on.  Based  on  this
assessment, a selection could then be made of those staff members which  the
merged institution would wish to retain. In  that  way  no  one  would  feel
unfairly marginalised. Surely there will be people  from  both  institutions
that the new institution would wish to retain?

In the name of patriotism and loyalty to  our  country  and  its  democratic
values, all merging institutions have to compromise certain parts  of  their
culture, embrace some parts of their merging partners and  move  forward  as
true South African institutions of higher learning.

In conclusion, I have no doubts that our  education  system  has  taken  big
strides forward in comparison to the systems of the past. It is  now  up  to
all of us stakeholders in education to put our shoulders to  the  wheel  and
ensure that our education system keeps  improving  and  compares  favourably
with the best education systems internationally. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  special  delegates  and  hon
members of this House, education is one  of  the  most  important  long-term
investments a country can make in its  citizens.  When  one  considers  that
this Budget Vote is among the top five,  one  begins  to  realise  how  much
value is placed on this department.

Under Programme 3 - General Education it is  noted  with  appreciation  that
the conditional grants for HIV and Aids have increased from R64  million  in
2001-02 to R142 million in the  current  financial  year.  The  funding  for
early childhood development has also  increased  from  R21  million  in  the
previous financial year to R52 million in 2002-03.

It is hoped that the provinces will not only reciprocate this good  gesture,
but will, more importantly, see to it that  the  funds  are  spent  for  the
purposes for which they were allocated, and that there is  no  underspending
of the funds when the need for  delivery  of  services  is  so  acute.  This
applies particularly to my province, which is lagging behind in a number  of
issues.

It is noted that technical colleges  are  to  be  reduced  from  152  to  50
further education and training colleges by April 2003. However, it would  be
interesting to know which areas will be  affected  and  what  measures  have
been put in place to ensure that  access  to  tertiary  education  in  those
areas  is  not  hampered  by  the  arrangements.  The   issue   of   merging
universities and technikons with other universities was a hot issue which  I
did not expect the Minister to tackle unscathed, but the Minister stood  his
ground, to the satisfaction of all who love him.

'n Afrikaanse gedigskrywer sê in  so  'n  geval  [In  such  an  instance  an
Afrikaans poet says]:``Ek hou van 'n man wat sy man kan staan.''  [``I  like
a man who can stand his ground.'']

However, given the current problems with these mergers, how  much  does  the
department expect to spend on legal fees relating to them?

It is also noted with appreciation that the allocation for higher  education
has been increased from R7,5 billion in  2001-02  to  R7,9  billion  in  the
financial year ending March 2003. Since the National Student  Financial  Aid
Scheme  does  not  cover  the  registration  costs  of  students,  and  many
disadvantaged young people with  the  potential  to  further  their  studies
cannot afford to pay registration, has the department considered  a  way  of
assisting students to cover registration costs?

Notwithstanding these few issues that I have raised, the UCDP supports  this
Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members,  I  am  reading  this
speech on behalf of the MEC for education, Mr Padayachee, who is  unable  to
be here. I  should  commence  by  indicating  the  various  steps  that  the
Mpumalanga department of education is taking to improve access to books  and
services for our learners. The target has been reached for the reduction  of
the personnel: nonpersonnel expenditure  ratio  from  85:150.  This  implies
that 15% of R555 million of the budgeted R3,654 billion will be directed  to
service delivery, compared to 11% of R371 million  in  2001-02.  The  budget
for stationery and textbooks has increased by 100%,  that  is  R136  million
allocated for the 2003 school year  as  compared  to  R68  million  for  the
previous year.

Last year R83 million was spent on building 386  classrooms,  42  specialist
rooms,  32  administration  blocks,  873  toilets;  and  67   schools   were
renovated, 19 schools fenced, 17 schools provided with water and 13  schools
electrified. In addition, renovations and repairs to  flood-damaged  schools
were conducted at a cost of R3 million. From the conditional  grant  of  R24
million allocated to the  previous  year,  various  renovations  were  made;
fencing, water and electricity were provided; and toilets were built.

In 2003 the budget for school infrastructure increases by 48%, that is  from
R83 million to R123 million. This will enable us to build an additional  401
classrooms, 12 administration blocks, 28 specialist rooms and  722  toilets.
This allocation will also cater for the renovation of 184  schools  and  for
the provision of water and electricity to 83 schools.

With regard to easing the burden on learners from rural and farm  areas  who
have to contend with walking  long  distance  to  access  schools,  we  have
increased the scholar transport subsidy by 120%. This is  an  increase  from
R8 million to R18 million, with the number of routes increased  from  48  to
102 to the benefit of 11 299 learners.

Regarding the stable management  of  schools,  552  promotional  posts  have
already been filled. In addition, a landmark agreement was  reached  at  the
Education Labour Relations  Council  Chamber  to  translate  into  permanent
posts the temporary teachers with two or more years of service.

Through private-public partnerships and international assistance R6  million
was donated in the past financial year.  The  programmes  supported  by  the
donors included technology, inclusive education and OBE, as well as teacher-
training restructuring.

The Mpumalanga Education Development Trust donated R2,66  for  both  capital
and  education  development  projects.  The  Mpumalanga  Secondary   Science
Initiative,  MSSI,  a  joint  undertaking  by   the   Mpumalanga   education
department  and  Japan,  which  includes  various  other   initiatives,   is
contributing  significantly  to  improved  performance  in  mathematics  and
science education.

Through the assistance of the Japanese government, 20 fully fledged  schools
are in the process of being built. In addition, this collaboration  provides
administrative and management support to  school  principals  and  heads  of
departments, as well as providing of effective  school  governance  training
to school governing bodies. With regard to LSEN  learners  -  learners  with
special educational needs - the  principle  of  mainstreaming,  crystallised
through the inclusive education pilot programme, has  already  commenced  at
ten schools.

At this stage, I wish to say to Minister Asmal that  we  greatly  appreciate
his  announcement  on  higher  education  reconfiguration,  particularly  in
relation to Mpumalanga. This new development  will  certainly  optimise  and
enhance further career possibilities in diverse fields for the  majority  of
learners from the formerly marginalised sections of our society.

I take pride in the establishment  of  a  hotel  school  as  the  Mpumalanga
Tourism Academy. The full tourism potential of Mpumalanga  will  be  greatly
enhanced. Students at this  academy  will  receive  accredited  training  in
hospitality,  namely  in  accommodation,  front  desk,  food  and   beverage
services,  food   preparation   services,   hotel   management   and   hotel
maintenance.

This  will  also  include  the  training   of   tour   and   field   guides,
receptionists, travel agents and tour operators, and training in  ecotourism
and a whole range of other forms of expertise. At an initial  cost  of  R9,2
million, this holds immense and unlimited potential for the development  and
growth of our human resource base. I can assure the House that this will  be
the first tourism academy of its kind in the country.

Our commitment to combating the spread  of  the  HIV/Aids  pandemic  remains
unwavering. Awareness programmes are targeting both learners  and  educators
in lifeskills education at a cost of R10,3 million. [Applause.]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, the UDM  supports  the
Budget Vote. Today I want to confine myself  to  a  matter  which  is  quite
disturbing to me as a parent and  a  teacher,  a  matter  which  is  vitally
important for the department whose mandate it is to  provide  our  children,
regardless of race, colour or social background,  with  equal  opportunities
to quality education, while  guaranteeing  their  right  to  safe  learning,
freedom of the person and human dignity.

The Select Committee  on  Education,  in  partnership  with  the  provinces,
initiated public hearings in 2001  on  sexual  violence  in  schools.  Media
reports  and  feedback  from  our   constituencies   confirm   that   sexual
molestation of schoolchildren is still continuing, if not getting worse.

Recently reported incidents of two male teachers who sexually assaulted  two
schoolboys, of seven female teachers who forced a 15-year-old schoolgirl  to
use a banana to perform a sexual act, and of a  high  school  girl  who  was
found  raped  and  murdered,  allegedly  by  fellow  schoolboys,  are  clear
examples  of  such  deplorable  conduct  that  the  hon  Minister  correctly
described recently  as  a  kind  of  sickness  in  society  where  the  most
vulnerable of young people were in peril.

If this rot is not swiftly rooted out, history will judge us  harshly  as  a
nation that does not care and as a nation with no pride, because  our  young
people will carry into adulthood both the emotional and the  physical  scars
of humiliation and a permanently bitter feeling of dishonour.
We  seek  effective  remedies  to  this  scourge.  I  am  happy   that   the
recommendations  by  the  select  committee  are  partly  contained  in  the
initiative  by  the  department  to  address  the  matter.  The  pledge   by
educators, their unions and student bodies  is  an  important  step  in  the
right direction. But we would like to have the involvement  of  parents  and
school governing bodies clearly defined in the campaign, and have them  also
pledging a commitment that they will actively take the lead in the  struggle
and not just bury their heads in the sand while children suffer  irreparable
harm.

Undonakele omkhulu singawukhomba  apha  ebazalini  nakumaqumrhu  elilawulayo
ezikolweni. Ixhomisa amehlo imeko yokuxhatshazwa  kwabafundi.  Onke  amandla
olawulo  lwezikolo  namakhaya  lusezandleni  zabazali  nala  maqumrhu   koko
abawasebenzisi ngempumelelo. (Translation of a Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The problem is with parents and the school governing bodies.  The  rate  of
sexual abuse of  learners  at  schools  is  appalling.  Parents  and  school
governing bodies have power in their hands but they are  unable  to  use  it
successfully.]

As  in  the  case  of  HIV/Aids  awareness   programmes,   counselling   and
capacitating parents on how to tackle the challenges of sexual abuse  should
be vigorously embarked upon, alongside the intervention  strategies  already
contemplated by the department to help children protect  themselves  against
sexual harassment.

The select committee, in its recommendations, also emphasised the  need  for
co-ordinated efforts  within  departments,  such  as  Safety  and  Security,
Education,  Social  Development,  Health,  and  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development, with strong committee forums  all  participating  in  combating
sexual abuse of children.

Perhaps to illustrate how severe other nations are in  dealing  with  sexual
offenders, a school teacher in Hanoi, Vietnam, has been executed for  raping
six pupils, despite an appeal for clemency by parents of his victims.  While
taking the law into one's hands cannot be advocated,  may  I  indicate  that
the public hearings on sexual violence  revealed  that  certain  communities
are losing patience with sexual criminals.

However, as responsible leaders and citizens, we have  a  responsibility  to
save our children and to assure them of a bright future.  We  encourage  the
department, therefore, to champion the crusade against the  moral  decay  of
the nation. [Applause.]

Mrs L N JAJULA (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,
education is the cornerstone of any  nation.  We  believe,  as  the  Eastern
Cape, that in order to succeed in transforming, in  actually  achieving  the
objectives of and in realising what the Freedom Charter stands for, we  need
to make sure that in the budget process education gets the biggest slice.

That is why the amount  allocated  to  education  in  the  province  is  the
highest amount, namely R8,9 billion. In that sense, we are  looking  forward
to addressing the following issues. Firstly, the call by  the  President  of
the country that for the next three years no child should be taught under  a
tree must be addressed.

Therefore, 250 schools will be built within this financial  year.  The  next
point we have realised is that in order to succeed in  school  effectiveness
and education professionalism, the educators themselves  must  be  educators
with capacity and effectiveness.

Statistics have revealed that in the  Eastern  Cape  18  700  educators  are
underqualified. That reflects the  downfall  in  effectiveness  and  in  the
achievement of better results. The Eastern Cape has rendered a programme  to
upgrade teachers at the University  of  the  Transkei.  As  many  as  2  894
teachers have registered for higher education and diplomas to improve  their
level of education.

Besides that, we have engaged in a programme  for  training  principals  and
their deputies, heads of departments. The  training  programme  is  to  make
sure that the  principals  and  heads  of  departments  have  the  following
skills. They must have skills in financial management,  human  and  material
resource management, change management, communication and  time  management.
They must also have skill  in  aspects  of  conflict  resolution,  which  is
always a challenge at certain levels and particularly at certain schools  in
our province.

The scourge of HIV is being addressed by some hon members. We  address  this
with a clustered  approach  involving  the  Departments  of  Health,  Social
Development and Safety and  Security.  We  would  like  to  make  sure  that
whoever wants to fiddle and deliberately does  so  with  our  schoolchildren
knowing that he or she is HIV-positive must account to the  justice  system.
We believe that we need to move towards  having  legislation  to  get  these
people punished.

This cannot go on as if nothing is happening. We involve the NGOs  and  SGBs
in  the  programme  to  ensure  that  the  HIV/Aids  programme  is  actually
discussed at home. People must realise that it is not  a  school  programme,
but something that should be discussed around the table by every person  and
all their relatives because, most unfortunately, the  victims  are  affected
and victimised by their own relatives and friends, those they trust.

At the level of special schools and  special  needs  education,  we  realise
that there is policy shift, but we believe, as the  Eastern  Cape,  that  we
need to look at  the  different  disabilities  that  are  there  instead  of
shifting everyone towards the mainstream, because  some  of  them  will  not
succeed. Instead, we should look at a mechanism that  will  actually  assist
those who cannot go into the academic stream, but  who  can  use  their  own
physical hands to produce certain items and be qualified under  the  further
education and training programme. That is our wish as a province.

On adult basic education, or Abet, we realise that last year we  had  7  604
females and 2 222 males who registered in this programme, which  reflects  a
good number. In spite of the results that were not  pleasing  in  Grade  12,
the adult basic education results, as the  Minister  knows,  reflected  very
well. This year we have a total of 11 000 that  have  registered  for  adult
education, which we believe is a good move to improve the  quality  of  life
and reduce poverty in South Africa - and  not  only  in  the  Eastern  Cape,
because some of these people are actually from across  the  borders  of  our
province, as most of us know.

If we look at further education and training, the department in  its  report
has reflected a partnership with the private sector involving mechanics  for
the motor industry in the Eastern Cape, which we need to turn around. We  do
not need to produce academics as technocrats,  but  we  need  to  produce  a
motor mechanic that has practised  producing  a  car  before  receiving  the
qualification of a certificate. That partnership  has  been  forged  between
Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and further education and training  institutions
that are training these learners for technology as well as with  Telkom  for
telephones and communications. That is a success  which  the  department  is
achieving this year.

But we still have to train most of our people and managers at all levels  in
technology and we need to make sure that each manager  is  able  to  run  an
institution with a clear sense of effectiveness  and  efficiency  and  cost-
effectiveness regarding the amount  of  money  that  is  allocated  to  that
institution. We have secured a close relationship with  the  churches.  Most
of our people go out to the churches, and education is for us all.  What  is
it that the church is preaching towards the restoration of the morality  and
dignity of our society? We have got to turn it around and preach the  gospel
which says that one should go back to human dignity and realise  that  as  a
human one cannot destroy someone's else rights and be proud at  the  end  of
the day.

The shift to promote the level of Grade R is a  wonderful  one.  The  budget
for the Eastern Cape recognises that in order to get  the  best  results  in
life, Grade R must have a good foundation, and there is an increase  of  16%
in that budget. We believe that if Grade R  moves,  then  the  rest  of  the
classes will succeed, because that is where  we  have  the  career  guidance
that identifies where the child is going to move and guides the  child  from
Grade R onwards.

I do believe that the situation at the farm schools  will  improve.  We  are
trying to cluster those farm schools together with transport that will  give
access those schools, but it is  not  going  to  be  a  fast  programme.  It
started this year in partnership with the Department of  Transport,  because
the farms are far apart from each other but the school needs to be  central.
It need not be a round hut, but has to be a building that  is  conducive  to
learning and teaching.

We need to improve the science and mathematics awards. We need to make  sure
that those who achieve the best are recognised. We believe that at the  same
time we must go back to what we used to call winter schools. This  does  not
take anybody's time but  encourages  a  programme,  everybody  needs  to  be
scientific today. We need, in the future, to reach out there and compete  in
the world as scientists. But  unless  we  boost  and  award  those  who  are
achieving the best we will not succeed. The nation will prosper with  better
education. [Applause.]

Mr R STADTHOUER (Northern Cape): Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  MECs  and
hon members, we live in a world where  the  three  richest  individuals  own
more wealth than the 48 poorest countries, where a quarter  of  the  world's
population consumes three quarters of the world's energy  and  minerals  and
eats more than half of the world's food.  The  huge  gap  between  rich  and
poor, between weak and powerful, is growing bigger. Sustainable  development
is simply not possible while millions live in poverty.

This world reality is our South African reality and also our  Northern  Cape
reality. Our life and work in the Northern  Cape  are  therefore  shaped  by
this reality too. It is within the context of Nepad, with this  huge  divide
between the rich and the poor and these gross inequalities, that we  execute
our mandate of educating our children.

As we approach the end of our first decade of freedom, we pause  to  reflect
on whether the programmes that  we  as  Government  have  put  in  place  in
education have given hope to the poor. A review must be  made  to  establish
whether we have  succeeded  in  the  contributions  that  we  have  made  to
alleviate poverty, effect equity  and  reduce  illiteracy,  develop  skills,
deracialise our schools, combat HIV and Aids and fight  crime,  and  in  our
quest to provide a better life for all.

As we started our journey to transform  the  education  landscape  in  1994,
children were  in  need  of  decent  and  basic  school  accommodation.  The
education landscape revealed  no  coherent  programme  for  early  childhood
development and adult literacy. No idea  of  higher  education  institutions
existed and the challenges were enormous.

We are proud to report that we have, since 1994, amalgamated and  integrated
more than 24  previously  separated  schools  into  12  integrated  schools.
However, we could not conclude our work in  this  regard.  Racism  is  still
rife and many  schools  exist  without  justification  as  a  cost-efficient
entity. We now declare our resolve to  continue  with  the  amalgamation  of
schools with renewed verve.

We are not satisfied that staff and school governing bodies  are  reflecting
the interests and the aspirations of the broader learner population at  some
of our schools in the province. We are fully aware of schools still  abusing
legislation to maintain the vast disparities  in  learner  demographics  and
staff compositions. We therefore support  the  proposed  amendments  to  the
Employment of Educators Act that go some way in ensuring the realisation  of
more equitable employment practices at our schools and to  ensure  that  the
balance between staff and learner compositions are equalised.

We do not intend to stand idle and watch the misappropriation of  policy  by
those who refuse to recognise the legitimacy of our consensus.  We  wish  to
sound a stern warning to those who continue to undermine our  transformation
that we are adamant in our resolve to conclude the transformation process.

Our greatest challenge was the task of  radically  reducing  the  number  of
learners of compulsory schoolgoing age that were out of school  and  roaming
the streets or at the mercy of unscrupulous exploiters of child labour.  Our
current data analysis points to a radical improvement in this regard.  Every
child must be in school. The doors of learning must be open to every child.
Our focus for the next two years  is  to  accelerate  change,  to  speed  up
transformation in our schools, to eradicate the last vestiges of  racism  in
education and to fully realise the call of the Freedom Charter, and that  is
to open the doors of learning to our children. Our budget  in  the  Northern
Cape will  indicate  a  distinct  awareness  of  the  provision  of  quality
education as the first and foremost weapon in the arsenal  launched  against
poverty.

As part of our commitment to fulfilling  our  role  as  a  province  in  the
alleviation of poverty and redress of past  imbalances,  we  are  constantly
refining our resource allocation modules to narrow the gap between the  rich
and the poor schools towards achieving equity. Due to the high  turnover  in
the membership of school governing bodies, continuous  training  is  needed.
In our attempts  to  assist  schools,  the  department  is  embarking  on  a
comprehensive training and capacity-building  drive  to  assist  schools  to
improve financial management and to finalise the  development  of  financial
tracking systems in all our districts.

Our seriousness is amply displayed by the fact that we  have  increased  our
allocation for adult basic education and training by  40%  from  R5  million
last year to R9 million this  year.  We  are  confidently  targeting  a  10%
reduction in illiteracy through our National Literacy  Initiative  programme
and we will further increase our number of Abet centres by 10% as from  this
year. The enactment of the Adult  Basic  Education  Act  has  given  further
coherence to our adult literacy programmes.

One of our direct interventions specifically targeted to  alleviate  poverty
among the target groups is the primary school nutrition programme, which  is
led by the Department of Health. Well over 90 000 of our learners,  of  whom
73 800 are to be fed in rural areas, have  benefited  from  this  programme.
This resonates in the President's call to ``rise and to  do  it  yourself''.
That is why we intend to bring our communities on board to  assist  in  this
regard. The Letsema  campaign  has  given  momentum  to  this  programme  in
different towns in our province.

We are aware of the fact that basic  infrastructure  in  providing  learning
spaces should go hand in hand with the creation of  a  learning  environment
that is safe and secure and where quality education programmes are  offered.
Our province is committed  to  stamping  out  gangsterism,  drug  abuse  and
violence in our schools. To this end, the department is conducting  searches
and raids  in  our  schools,  and  these  have  resulted  in  a  significant
reduction in crime at our schools. These interventions have  enabled  us  to
contribute to the provincial efforts to combat crime and violence.

We further wish to reiterate our position that we are  implementing  a  zero
tolerance attitude towards educators who sexually abuse our learners.

Allow me also to make an input regarding the HIV and  Aids  programmes.  Our
programme  focuses  on  HIV/Aids  and  life-skills  education,  and  we  are
targeting the training of 1 500 educators during  this  financial  year.  We
believe that our messages of prevention and empowerment and the  raising  of
awareness are correct. We must, however, do more and more in this regard.

At this point, let me also refer to the establishment of  the  institute  of
higher education in our province. We would like to thank  the  Minister  and
to acknowledge his involvement in this. We  thank  the  national  department
under  the  leadership  of  our  Minister  for  the  establishment  of  this
institution in our province. We,  however,  as  a  province,  have  put  the
necessary mechanisms in place to proceed with the implementation thereof.

In conclusion, we are  constantly  reminded  that  we  have  to  fulfil  our
mandate  of  basic  education  within  an   environment   characterised   by
technological advances taking place at high speed.  On  this  note  I  would
like to thank the hon the Minister for  the  excellent  national  leadership
that he provides, and the  Select  Committee  on  Education  for  fulfilling
their team role in  providing  the  province  with  the  necessary  national
information, and the excellent relationship that can only go  from  strength
to strength. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank  you  very  much.  I  would  like  to
inform the hon the Minister that I have  just  returned  from  the  Northern
Cape, from Upington - that is why I was a bit  late,  and  I  apologise  for
that - where I addressed a group of businessmen last night.  They  asked  me
to convey to the hon the Minister their thanks  for  what  he  envisages  at
tertiary level for the Northern Cape. They also asked me to  tell  him  that
the community of Upington is ready to host the  tertiary  facility  for  the
Northern Cape in the heart of the natural growth area of that province.

The New NP in the Northern  Cape,  but  also  nationally,  is  committed  to
supporting all efforts to promote quality education for all  our  people  in
South Africa. But when we have concerns we need the Minister  to  listen  to
this and to hear our concerns. At this very moment the New  NP  still  needs
to decide on whether we are going to support  hon  Minister  Asmal's  Budget
Vote next week in the National Assembly.

To us it is a very serious matter, for we  understand  and  agree  with  the
importance of good education in the  development  of  our  beloved  country,
South Africa, and we also understand that the injustices of  the  past  must
be put right. We also understand the necessity of the leading role  we  have
to play in South Africa  in  this  regard  for  the  whole  of  Africa,  and
especially to assist with Nepad.

We want to support the hon the  Minister,  but  we  also  represent  a  fair
portion of the approximately 3 million white and just over 3  million  brown
members of  the  Afrikaans  community  in  South  Africa.  Coming  from  the
Northern Cape, where we are 85% Afrikaans-speaking, I am sure that  the  hon
the Minister can understand my passion for this specific  topic.  Especially
after the hon the Minister's announcement on the merger, he was labelled  on
the Internet, in the press, on the radio, on the streets,  as  enemy  number
one of Afrikaans. They even call him ``Lord Asmal'', who has take the  place
of the historical enemy of Afrikaans, Lord Milner.

This perception is a serious allegation, and this negativity does  not  bode
at all well for what we are busy with in education at  the  moment.  I  hope
the hon the Minister takes this opportunity to tell us whether he  is  enemy
number one or not.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Why am I enemy number one?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: I am telling the hon the Minister what the  people  say.
If he is not, let him please spell it out, so that we  can  be  strengthened
in getting rid of this negative perception. We  are  prepared  to  help  him
with that, and we are prepared to support the Budget Vote as well.

We only need an answer. Does the hon the Minister still agree with  what  he
said on the 27 February 2002 in the question time  in  the  other  House?  I
handed a copy of that Hansard to his officials a bit earlier  today,  and  I
would like him to respond to that. I also want to share  with  the  hon  the
Minister the sentiments of some Afrikaans academics and  opinion-formers  on
the hon the Minister's answers to the questions here earlier  this  week.  I
will have to read this in Afrikaans, so the hon the  Minister  must  prepare
himself. I hope you add some time to my allocation, Chairperson. They say:


  Ons is bekommerd daaroor dat die Minister se versekering dat hy teen geen
  taal diskrimineer nie, en dat sy departement  mettertyd  'n  bevredigende
  taalbeleid sal ontwikkel, nie gerealiseer kan, of gaan, word nie.


  Die tekens dat die Minister ander middels soos finansiering, diversiteit,
  arbeidsbeleid, ens, wil gebruik om inrigtings vir  hoër  onderwys  in  'n
  onomkeerbare taalbeleid in te dwing wat  eventuele  gelykberegtiging  van
  alle tale onmoontlik sal  maak,  blyk  uit  die  antwoorde  wat  die  agb
  Minister gegee het.

Hulle sê verder: [They go on to say:]


  Aan  Afrikaanse  inrigtings  geld  dieselfde  beginsel  as  aan   Engelse
  universiteite, en aan alle universiteite dwarsoor die wêreld, naamlik dat
  hulle daar is om bepaalde gemeenskappe te dien. Die feit dat  Suid-Afrika
  'n land van vele tale is, hef daar die beginsel nie op nie.  Enige  Suid-
  Afrikaner wat in Engeland, Nederland, Duitsland, of in enige  ander  land
  in die wêreld,  gaan  studeer,  moet  eers  'n  taalbevoegdheidstoets  in
  daardie tale slaag.


  Afrikaanse  universiteite  het  uit  hulle   pad   gegaan   om   sodanige
  taalkursusse in te stel. In die  buiteland  word  dit  selfs  vereis  van
  buitelandse studente alvorens hulle tot kursusse toegelaat word. Aan Suid-
  Afrikaanse universiteite word dit vir gespesialiseerde nagraadse onderrig
  nie  vereis  nie,  maar  word  dit  net   sterk   aanbeveel.   Afrikaanse
  universiteite is dus veel meer tegemoetkomend as wat  die  internasionale
  norm is.


  Taal aan universiteite dien nie bloot net 'n nuttigheidsfunksie nie. Taal
  druk  ook  identiteit  uit.  Enige  diskriminasie   teen   Afrikaans   as
  onderrigtaal is dus diskriminasie teen die Afrikaanse identiteit.
Die agb Minister het dit aangespreek in die vrae anderkant,  en  daarop  wil
ek nou ook die antwoorde hê.

Die Grondwet beklemtoon die erkenning  van  kulturele  diversiteit,  en  dit
moet ook in hoër onderwys tot uitdrukking kom. Dit is dus nie bloot  net  'n
kwessie van aangesien  Afrikaanse  studente  ook  Engels  ken,  daarom  teen
Afrikaans gediskrimineer mag word nie.

As die agb Minister praat van dubbelmediumonderwys verval  sy  argument  oor
studente wat oor geen taalvaardigheid in Afrikaans beskik nie.  Dubbelmedium
veronderstel dat die tale gelyktydig in die klas  gebruik  word,  en  vereis
dus meerdere taalvaardighede van die  studente.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The hon Minister addressed this in the questions on the other side,  and  I
would also like the answers to that now.

The Constitution emphasizes the recognition of cultural diversity, and  this
must also be realised in higher education. It  is  therefore  not  simply  a
question that, seeing as Afrikaans students  also  know  English,  Afrikaans
can therefore be discriminated against.
When the hon Minister talks about dual-medium education, his argument  about
students who have no language proficiency in Afrikaans  lapses.  Dual-medium
presumes that the languages are used simultaneously in  the  classroom,  and
therefore requires superior language skills of the students.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time is up.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: You are unfair, Chairperson, but I accept  your  ruling.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Madam Chair, hon Minister and hon members,  it  is  a  great
honour for me to debate this Budget Vote here today.  Some  of  the  answers
are going to come from the Minister, because the speaker before me  directed
those questions to him. The one that I can also try to shed light on is  the
question of identifying the enemy. It is worrying to me that at  this  stage
as a nation we do not know what our enemy is. In education we  do  not  know
that the ignorance and illiteracy in this country are our enemy. We  do  not
know that the poverty that is in this country is our enemy. It raises a  lot
of questions if we do not know that yet.
Let me come to my speech  now.  All  nations  by  now  should  realise  that
education is central and imperative to any country's development,  and  that
should be embraced by our nation too. Any nation should  understand  that  a
learning nation is a  winning  nation.  We  should  take  a  lesson  from  a
developing country like Cuba, for example, whose economy was devastated  and
also knocked by Cold War stereotypes. In the midst of those pressures,  this
particular country managed to produce many doctors, enough for  herself  and
also for the benefit of other developing countries, like ours.

There is no doubt that, in the times that we are living in, when  developing
nations are not exactly reaping the fruits of  globalisation,  education  is
of the  essence.  It  is  a  key  to  innovation,  mental  emancipation  and
liberation  from  ignorance,  poverty  and  underdevelopment.  It   is   the
essential key to making this century  an  African  century,  a  key  to  the
success of an African Union and a key for us as  a  continent  to  meet  the
objectives of Nepad.

In the hon the Minister's words, education is a vaccine that has  proven  to
work, and the one we should capitalise on and make work even better  by  the
content and type of education we offer and the way we manage it. It is  that
education that the youth of June 16 fought and died for. To our youth  today
we are saying that that education is available, so they  must  make  use  of
it. We have come a long way as a nation, hence at this  particular  point  I
would like to congratulate the  department  on  its  visible  commitment  to
reform in the education sector.

I would like to commend the department for its  dedication  to  the  success
and prosperity of this country and to an education  that  builds  democracy,
human dignity,  equality  and  social  justice,  an  education  system  that
responds to  the  enormous  economic  and  social  challenges  of  the  21st
century.  As  in  any  young  democracy,  change  does  not   come   without
challenges. In some of the provinces that  we  visited,  in  particular  the
rurally concentrated provinces, more  work  needs  to  be  done,  especially
where education is concerned. Progress is much  slower  in  those  provinces
compared to the powerhouses like Gauteng and the Western Cape.

What was more visible, particularly in my province, the  Eastern  Cape,  was
the low levels of infrastructure,  the  lack  of  libraries  and  computers,
irregularities in terms  of  delivering  books,  sanitation  and  access  to
toilets. I have met quite a number  of  students  who,  once  they  complete
matric, either stay at home or go and look  for  jobs  in  the  big  cities,
simply because they have no access to financial assistance or  do  not  even
know how to access it. The role of efficient teachers and resources to  make
sure that this information is available  becomes  more  crucial.  I  believe
that this is not an issue that should be taken lightly.

It is a reality  of  our  democracy  that  the  majority  of  our  youth  is
concentrated in the rural sector. We are talking about  the  youth  that  is
part and parcel of what will happen to the future of this country. If we  go
far enough as a nation in investing in the education of this youth,  out  of
them will come scientists, economists and the wisest leaders the  world  has
ever seen. If we do not, they might take another route that is  one  not  of
prosperity, but of survival, of  lost  innocence,  of  ignorance  and  moral
degeneration and of loss of hope.

I am positive that in our various walks of life  we  have  come  across  the
eyes of an innocent child in the streets of our cities, gazing  at  us  with
no sign of hope. We have seen innocent young girls turning  to  prostitution
because that is the only way they know how to survive. What kind  of  adults
will these children become?

Hence we are forever questioning the morality of the  times  we  are  living
in, and yet that immorality is a direct consequence of the realities of  the
challenges we face as a nation. Not so long ago, in his state of the  nation
speech,  the  hon  the  President   stressed   the   importance   of   moral
regeneration, which should be a responsibility that  all  of  us  take  upon
ourselves for life. This arises from the  understanding  that,  just  as  we
were our own liberators in our resistance to apartheid,  so  too  should  we
today act as our own liberators in dealing with this legacy.

We as a nation, regardless of which political parties we  represent,  should
embrace and support the betterment of the future and the restoration of  the
moral order of this country.

To conclude, I would like to stress the fact  that  education  is  a  cross-
cutting sector, it is where  all  departments  intersect.  Therefore  it  is
important that various departments join hands, like Trade and  Industry  and
Water Affairs and Forestry, and contribute to the  best  possible  education
for all. To quote Iran Booth in his paper South Africa: Reasons to stay:


  ... to the nation that won its place in history


  .... the nation with the brightest future


  ... the nation that fights and wins ...

Let us be that nation, and fight and win the battle for  the  prosperity  of
the future of our children and for access to the best education for all.  As
the ANC we support this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr S B NGIDI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, I come from a province which  has
allocated close to R10 billion to education,  which  makes  it  the  biggest
provincial department of education in the  country.  I  was  listening  with
interest to what the hon the Minister was saying  earlier,  and  I  actually
commend  the  contributions  made  by  the  hon  the  Minister  in  whatever
endeavours he has to go  through  to  realise  increased  funding,  in  real
terms, for education in the country.  We  actually  support  the  Minister's
efforts with regard to that.
I also listened with interest to the analogy he used of Japan and  the  fact
that we have some foundations in place also to be able to  move  along  with
Japan into the next 40 years. We have actually spent the first  eight  years
and the prognosis in terms of what the hon the Minister  said,  is  that  we
are actually doing the right things now. I sincerely hope that the  next  32
years will actually see us being on course rather  than  being  off  course,
for whatever reason.

May I also assure the hon the Minister right  up  front  that  we  from  the
province of KwaZulu-Natal do not regard him as an enemy, whether we  say  it
in jest or in all seriousness. We actually do  not  look  at  him  as  enemy
number one.

There are quite a number of things that we can actually  regard  as  enemies
of education as it progresses through its transformation process.  First  of
all I want to start with HIV/Aids as an enemy. The KwaZulu-Natal  department
of education recognises the gravity and enormity of the  HIV/Aids  pandemic.
It is, for us, the number one scourge that is threatening the very  survival
of the education function in the province. Therefore the province  has  made
HIV/Aids the number one priority, in keeping with Tirisano, as well as  with
our own provincial plans. The immediate response has been to  further  boost
the human and budget resource allocation for HIV/AIDS, so that the  province
has not only scaled up on current interventions which are already  in  place
but also prioritises and has indicated other delivery structures.

In the previous year, we grouped death among  educators,  for  instance,  in
terms of illness, accidents, violence and suicide. Out of  a  total  of  557
educators who died, 508 of  those  died  from  various  different  kinds  of
illnesses, and these 508 were between the ages of  25  and  49  years.  Even
though that there  is  no  direct  linkage  between  their  deaths  and  the
possibility that they might have died of HIV/Aids, we are aware that  almost
22% of the people in the province are actually affected by the pandemic.  It
is a real problem when it actually  begins  to  eat  away  at  the  educator
corps.

Somebody said once that one of the challenges  this  country  is  facing  is
that if HIV/Aids is not checked  it  is  going  to  eat  away  our  security
forces,  and  when  it  does  that  we  will  actually  begin  to  see   the
implications of how serious that particular pandemic is - when  it  actually
eats away at the people who are  supposed  to  protect  the  very  education
system which we are talking of.

There are a number of things which the province is trying to do in order  to
face this particular challenge. We know that the ECG  grant  allocation  for
HIV/Aids, which is a project on life-skills, increased to R31  million  from
the previous R18 million. I would  concur  with  and  support  the  hon  the
Minister when he says that it is  not  acceptable  if  provinces  get  these
conditional grants and do not use them to the full in the face of  the  dire
need and dire straits in which our people - the  children  as  well  as  the
educators and the communities in general - find themselves.

From 2000 to 2002 the province successfully  trained  the  required  40%  of
educators  from  Grade  6  to  9  in  life-skills  and  HIV/Aids  education.
Apparently some regions exceeded  this  40%  and  trained  up  to  70%,  and
consequently the province has trained more than 8  300  educators  in  life-
skills and HIV/Aids education, which is commendable. There have also been  a
number of advocacy workshops for school governing  bodies,  communities  and
parents, and these have had the desired positive outcomes. In  some  regions
parents have  formed  themselves  into  committees  which  are  involved  in
programme advocacy for life-skills and HIV education.

One of the most popular programmes in the province addressing HIV  and  Aids
and also providing edutainment is the extracurricular programme  for  youth,
sports, arts and culture, where the youth perform in  various  participatory
programmes which have HIV/Aids  themes.  These  are  quite  popular  in  the
province.

May I also say a little about the restructuring  of  the  further  education
and training colleges. The directorate for FET colleges in our  province  is
responsible for the implementation of FET in the  college  sector.  This  is
done in accordance with the Further Education and Training Act,  Act  98  of
1998. In terms of this Act, provinces, under the guidance  of  the  national
Department of Education, have developed policy frameworks for  the  changing
of the college landscape.  As  a  result  of  this  change  in  the  college
landscape we collated 24 different colleges in  the  province,  and  reduced
them into nine mega FET institutions to facilitate this, and it was done  in
terms of the Act.

We now have nine FET mega colleges which are spread throughout the  province
in the areas of Nongoma-Vryheid, Richards Bay-Eshowe, Newcastle,  Ladysmith,
Pinetown-KwaMashu, Durban South, Central Durban, Pietermaritzburg  and  Port
Shepstone.  This  was  done  in  line  with  guidance  from   the   national
department.

May I also state, with regard to school effectiveness, that there are a  few
things which we would like  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  hon  the
Minister. I know that there are policy guidelines in place  with  regard  to
the question of school fees and how school wish to  handle  this  particular
matter. But one thing which is becoming evident in the areas we stay  in  is
the fact that school fees are being used as a means of exclusion,  both  for
people who want to enter the institutions and for people who are already  in
the institutions. For those who are inside the institutions it is even  more
of an ordeal because children are told that they are not going  to  be  part
of any extracurricular programme. They cannot participate in sport  or  even
use the swimming pool, and they cannot go on tours like other  kids  because
their parents have not paid their school fees.

The schools know that this is not supposed to happen. It goes further. If  a
child has been admitted to a particular school,  a  sibling  of  that  child
cannot go to the same school if the parents have not paid the fees  for  the
first child in full. So one has these particular tensions developing.

They have also gone to the extent, because  they  want  to  move  away  from
that, of beginning to talk about the geographical areas that  children  come
from. In some places the geographical areas are set up in such  a  way  that
they favour some people as against others. This  is  being  used  now  as  a
means of exclusion.

Maybe our language policies, more especially with regard  to  promoting  the
indigenous languages, need to be  looked  into.  I  do  not  want  to  sound
sectorial by saying that my language needs to be promoted, but I  know  that
the Constitution provides for 11 different languages,  plus  sign  language,
that have equal status. What is gradually happening is the system  in  which
we find ourselves is providing more for the development  and  protection  of
English, and perhaps Afrikaans as well in some  areas,  and  is  not  really
allowing room for the development of other indigenous  languages.  This  has
to be looked into somehow. In areas like KwaZulu-Natal, for instance,  where
80% of the people speak Zulu ... [Time expired.]

Adv A H GAUM: Madam Chair, Prof Asmal is correct when he  stresses,  as  the
major theme of his budget speech in the NA, the need to ensure  both  access
to quality education and the success  of  learners  once  they  have  gained
access to our schools. The Western Cape government  is  fully  committed  to
ensuring both the access and the success of our  learners.  Our  vision  for
education in the Western Cape is effective education for  all.  Our  mission
is  to  create  vibrant,  self-reliant,  well-managed,  effective   learning
institutions. Our call is to put education first, so that more and  more  of
our learners can break through to a better future.

We are determined to remove all obstacles that prevent  access  of  learners
to our education system and to walk the extra  mile  to  actively  seek  new
ways to improve access. No child should be forced to settle for  second-rate
education.

There are many critical challenges we must address. They  include  effective
teaching and learning, good management  and  governance,  and  safe,  secure
school environments that are conducive to effective teaching  and  learning.
Many factors play a role in ensuring effective teaching  and  learning.  Key
factors  include  the  curriculum,  the  supply  of  textbooks  and  teacher
training and recruitment. Equally important are the  media  of  instruction,
the language  of  instruction  and  the  technology  used  in  teaching  and
learning. The human factor is vital. Education will not happen  without  the
commitment, motivation and discipline of all concerned.

The curriculum lies at the heart of  everything  we  do  in  education.  The
revised curriculum will play a massive role  in  improving  the  quality  of
education in this country, by providing clear objectives  on  what  we  must
achieve, for each learning area, grade by grade. While I  was  a  critic  of
the original Curriculum 2005, as  the  Minister  knows,  I  gladly  give  my
support to the much improved version.

The first draft of the  revised  curriculum  raised  concerns  when  it  was
released late last year,  especially  around  the  issues  of  religion  and
religious education and sexuality  education.  We  are  satisfied  that  the
national Department of Education has ensured that statements in  respect  of
sexuality and religious education which were interpreted as being  offensive
have been removed. Although I shall continue to engage  Prof  Asmal  on  our
view that a child's  awareness  of  other  religions  through  education  in
different religions is  best  developed  later  in  his  or  her  life,  the
national curriculum statement does not encourage religious indoctrination.

I also wish to allay parents' fears  that  learners  will  not  observe  and
practise their religion at schools. The  South  African  Schools  Act  gives
school governing bodies the right to provide for religious  observances  and
religious  practices  as  long  as  learner  choice  in  relation  to  these
practices is respected. Schools may  also  offer  extracurricular  religious
instruction, if this  is  approved  by  the  school  governing  body.  I  am
grateful for Prof Asmal's undertaking to us not to amend the  South  African
Schools Act in this regard.

We have to accept that religious practices are part and parcel of the  daily
activities  of  many  schools.  As  long  as  every  learner's  religion  is
respected, we should never attempt to  superficially  remove  religion  from
schools. That would be a social experiment that we could ill afford.

Teachers obviously play an  absolutely  fundamental  role  in  ensuring  the
success of education. This week I announced that my department would  launch
a major  research  programme  this  year,  to  determine  exactly  how  many
teachers we need, in what grades and for  what  learning  areas,  to  ensure
detailed forward planning on our teaching requirements in the Western  Cape.
We are concerned about the looming  imbalance  between  teacher  supply  and
demand.

We will focus on  the  following  areas  in  our  research:  the  number  of
unemployed teachers in the province and the country; the number and  profile
of trainee teachers currently engaged in  preservice  training;  the  number
and profile of teachers needed in the Western Cape for  particular  learning
areas and grades;  and  the  likely  impact  of  HIV/Aids  on  teaching.  In
addition to informing forward planning, this  research  will  enable  us  to
launch a well-informed recruitment campaign for teachers in this province.

A major initiative this year will be the launch of our new institute for in-
service teacher development based at the Western Cape College of  Education.
My department found that in-service training  involving  short  courses  and
workshops had not been as successful as we would have liked and  decided  to
launch the institute, which will  provide  intensive  training  over  longer
periods. The first course for 50 teachers will start in  August  this  year.
My department has budgeted for substitute teachers  to  enable  teachers  to
attend these part-time courses.

Terwyl ek by die onderwerp van opleiding is, wil ek  graag  byvoeg  dat  ons
die nasionale Kabinet se  goedkeuring  van  die  herstrukturering  van  hoër
onderwysinstellings  verwelkom.  Ons   is   bly   dat   universiteite,   die
Universiteite van die Wes-Kaap en Fort Hare, hulle  aparte  identiteite  sal
kan  behou.  Daar  moet  in  ons  hoër  onderwysomgewing  ruimte  wees   vir
universiteite met spesiale karaktereienskappe.

Die behoeftes en samestelling van elke provinsie  moet  'n  rol  speel,  net
soos daar aan die versugtinge van die Noord-Kaap  en  Limpopo  om  eie  hoër
onderwysinstellings te kry, gehoor gegee is. Ek stem saam dat  universiteite
vir almal toeganklik moet wees, en dat iets soos taal, of  enigiets  anders,
nie  as  buffer  gebruik  mag  word  teen  toeganklikheid  en   voortgesette
hervorming   nie.   Dit   blyk   egter   dat   bepaalde   Afrikaanssprekende
universiteite, in die jongste  voorstelle  vir  hoër  onderwys,  uitgesonder
word vir  spesiale  aandag  deurdat  vereis  word  dat  hulle  parallel-  en
dubbelmediumklasse  moet  aanbied  ten  einde  meer   nie-Afrikaanssprekende
studente te akkommodeer.

Suid-Afrika is nie 'n eentalige land nie. Ons het  verskeie  provinsies  met
verskeie  taalwerklikhede  wat  geakkommodeer   moet   word.   Die   jongste
voorstelle oor universiteite se voertale getuig nie van konsekwentheid  nie.
Ek glo dat universiteite soos Stellenbosch en Potchefstroom  toegelaat  moet
word om hul regmatige plek  in  die  hoër  onderwyslandskap  as  hoofsaaklik
Afrikaanssprekende universiteite te handhaaf.

Daar  behoort  nie  'n  vereiste  van  parallel-  en  dubbelmediumklasse  op
voorgraadse vlak te wees nie, anders moet dieselfde vereiste beslis  ook  in
die Wes-Kaap by universiteite soos UCT en UWK gestel  word.  Die  klem  moet
veel eerder daarop val om meer amptelike tale van ons  land  tot  akademiese
tale  te  verhef,  en  om  taaloorbruggingsprogramme   by   die   Afrikaanse
universiteite te versterk.

Prof Asmal behoort te sorg dat finansiering hiervoor verskaf word.  Dit  sal
'n absolute onding wees as  iemand  sou  probeer  om  al  ons  universiteite
volledig te verengels of by verstek te verengels. Dit sou 'n belediging  vir
alle ander tale wees, en 'n daad van taalimperialisme. Dit sal die  dood  in
die pot wees vir taalverskeidenheid. Dit kan nie toegelaat word nie. Ek  wil
graag verskerings van Minister Asmal in hierdie verband hê. (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Whilst on the subject of training, I would like to add that we welcome  the
approval by the national Cabinet of the  restructuring  of  institutions  of
higher education. We are pleased that universities, the universities of  the
Western Cape and  Fort  Hare,  will  be  able  to  retain  their  individual
identities. There must be scope in  our  higher  education  environment  for
universities with special characteristics.

The needs and composition of each province should play a role, just  as  the
wishes of the Northern Cape and Limpopo to have their  own  institutions  of
higher  education  were  granted.  I  agree  that  universities  should   be
accessible to all, and that something such as language,  or  anything  else,
may not be used as a barrier against  accessibility  and  continued  reform.
However, it  seems  that  certain  Afrikaans  universities,  in  the  latest
suggestions for higher education, are singled out for special  attention  in
that it is demanded that they must present parallel and dual-medium  classes
in order to accommodate more non-Afrikaans-speaking students.

South Africa is not a unilingual country. We  have  various  provinces  with
various  language  realities  which  should  be  accommodated.  The   latest
suggestions on the language of  instruction  of  universities  do  not  bear
witness to consistency. I believe that  universities  such  as  Stellenbosch
and Potchefstroom should be allowed to maintain their rightful place in  the
higher education landscape as predominantly Afrikaans universities.

There should not be a requirement of parallel  and  dual-medium  classes  at
undergraduate level, otherwise the same requirement should  be  set  in  the
Western Cape at universities such as UCT and UWC. The emphasis  should  much
rather be placed on elevating more official languages of our country to  the
status  of  academic  languages,  and  on  strengthening   language-bridging
programmes at the Afrikaans universities.

Prof Asmal should see to it that financing is provided for  this.  It  would
be an absolute absurdity if someone were to try to completely Anglicise  all
our universities or to Anglicise by default. It would be an  insult  to  all
the other languages, and an act of language imperialism. This would  be  the
end of language diversity. This cannot be allowed.  I  would  like  to  have
assurances from Minister Asmal in this regard.]

This brings me to the issue of languages  of  instruction  in  schools.  The
language of instruction plays a huge role  in  ensuring  effective  teaching
and learning. Research has shown that home  language  instruction  is  vital
for the cognitive development of young learners.  I  also  believe  that  we
will only develop healthy relationships among our various population  groups
if we can speak each other's languages.

For these reasons, I appointed a ministerial task  team  earlier  this  year
with the following brief: to develop a strategy and  plan  for  implementing
home language instruction in Grades 1 to 7 in all  primary  schools  in  the
Western Cape and to  develop  a  strategy  for  introducing  third  language
instruction in primary schools in the Western Cape. We will  shortly  launch
a  video  on  multilingualism  in  the  classroom  which   will   contribute
significantly to raising awareness on this issue.

Another medium of  instruction  is,  of  course,  the  technology  used  for
teaching and learning, which ranges from chalk and talk to the  very  latest
in information and communication technology.  We  are  implementing  massive
projects to bring ICT into schools.  These  include  the  telecommunications
project, which will complete an initiative this year to  link  almost  every
school in the Western Cape to the Internet. Our Khanya and  Dassie  projects
are forging ahead in their efforts to develop innovative ways of  using  ICT
to enhance curriculum delivery in our public schools and  further  education
and training institutions.

Since e-learning is clearly the most important development in  education  in
decades, we are  determined  to  take  the  introduction  of  technology  in
education to new levels. We hope that Microsoft's magnanimous donation  will
encourage other sponsors to become involved as well. I would like to pose  a
direct challenge to our huge multinational companies  to  jump  into  action
and to plough similar major investments into our future.
We have identified  good  management  and  governance  as  crucial  for  the
success  of  education.  Our  key  strategy  is  to  decentralise  education
management to education management and development centres in each of  seven
new  education  districts.  The  aim  of  the   education   management   and
development centres is to bring development support much closer  to  schools
and to assist them in their efforts to become vibrant, effective centres  of
teaching and learning.

Other new  initiatives  this  year  include  launching  a  Partnerships  for
Progress programme, to bring together clusters of schools to learn from  one
another, and the launch of a  Mentors  and  Curators  programme,  to  assist
principals and school management in their efforts to improve the quality  of
school management. I will soon make  more  detailed  announcements  in  this
regard. Our new institute for  in-service  training  development  will  also
play a key role in providing management training to principals and  aspiring
principals.

We should also recognise that evaluation forms  an  essential  part  of  any
management process, including education  management.  Our  evaluation  tools
include ongoing contact by EMDC staff and  my  department's  annual  schools
survey. The survey is a self-assessment by schools, using a wide variety  of
indicators, covering  all  aspects  of  school  management  and  governance,
including a whole school index.

We now plan  to  complement  these  measures  by  introducing  whole  school
evaluation as developed by the national Department of Education. Prof  Asmal
has my full support as he seeks to implement  the  whole  school  evaluation
policy approved by the  Council  of  Education  Ministers.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members we have heard a  lot  of
good points about education. I think what is left now, or for the  educators
and lecturers, is for them to engage in what  is  called  introspection  and
for each to ask himself or herself: Am I really adhering to the  educational
values that have been put in place? Am I being loyal? Am  I  advocating  the
principles of democracy? I will come to that as I continue with my speech.

One of the most crucial issues in our society is the effectivess of  schools
and institutions of higher learning. That effectiveness is  central  to  the
development and economic growth of any democracy. It is  this  effectiveness
that will enlighten  our  learners  about  the  scourge  and  deadliness  of
HIV/Aids, promote moral values and human rights,  discourage  discrimination
and racism and motivate learners to  study  and  realise  that  the  key  to
success is education and not demolishing and destroying  the  structures  of
these institutions.

Central to this are educators. They are an absolutely integral part  of  the
education system and play an important part in the lives  of  our  learners.
They are the ones who become parents to our  children  in  our  absence  and
therefore play a  critical  role  in  their  mental  development.  How  they
conduct themselves and treat  our  children  and  the  kind  of  image  they
portray are of the essence.

President Mandela said, and I quote:


  One of the most powerful ways of  children  and  young  adults  acquiring
  values is to see individuals they  admire  and  respect  exemplify  those
  values in their own  being  and  conduct.  The  question  of  leadership,
  generally, and in the educational sphere particularly,  is  therefore  of
  vital importance.
Hence the launch of the network on values in education  by  the  Minister  a
few days back.

It becomes rather disturbing when the educators themselves do  not  live  up
to their professions and do what their professions  require  of  them.  That
poses a challenge to us as a nation and, in  particular,  as  leaders.  What
can each and every one of us do to deal with this challenge, because  it  is
our problem? The President named this year Vukuzenzele.  In  the  spirit  of
Vukuzenzele we must rise, act in partnership across the  nation  and  ensure
proper teaching and learning in our schools.

We have to act in partnership to help  educators  conform  to  the  code  of
conduct. This code specifically commits educators to the  noble  calling  of
their profession to educate and train their learners. It  also  acknowledges
that  the  attitude,  dedication,  self-discipline,  ideals,  training   and
conduct of the teaching profession determine the quality of education.

What also raises concern  is  the  racial  condition  of  the  former  white
institutions. As we all know, racism is still very rife  in  some  of  these
institutions.  What  are  the   implications   of   this   situation?   What
consequences will that have in the future of  this  country?  Transformation
has to start with the educators themselves, or else they will contribute  to
the psychological, mental and emotional degeneration of  the  fibre  of  our
society.

Surely we do not want to cultivate young people who  are  resentful,  bitter
or racist? If one has to elaborate on  this  one,  let  me  talk  about  two
students. There is student A, who takes time to do her homework  and  submit
assignments on time, and student B, who  only  does  the  assignment  a  day
before the due date. Student B, in the end, obtains  80%  whilst  student  A
obtains 30%.

In the hon the Minister's own words, we need teachers who  model  democratic
teaching styles. It has been shown that young  people  are  more  likely  to
respect themselves and others if they grow up in an environment  of  support
and acknowledgement.

At this juncture, allow me to extend my congratulations  to  the  department
with its enormous contribution to the  transformation  of  this  country  in
ensuring that we have a very efficient education sector that  is  accessible
to all.
While I am still articulating this, allow  me  to  quote  a  writer  in  the
Sunday Times who once said, ``The fact that  birds  eat  together  does  not
mean that they mix''. The hon the Minister once mentioned  in  this  Chamber
that when one visits these institutions, one sees the  racial  groupings  in
different corners.

We are very much aware that this has been and remains  a  challenging  task.
It is through the establishment of programmes like the Values  in  Education
programme of action that our country will go forward. Again,  I  would  like
to say to the hon the Minister  that  time  is  going  to  be  part  of  the
solution. This programme addresses precisely  the  challenges  that  I  have
highlighted. The hon the Minister has  stated  that  the  department  cannot
transform education on its own  and  that  it  should  look  to  its  social
partners, the educated people and professionals, for help.

I would like to take this opportunity to make an appeal to the  NCOP,  whose
constitutional obligation it is to make our provinces  respond  to  the  hon
the Minister's call. I propose that, given all the mechanisms put in  place,
we visit the schools and tertiary  institutions  to  get  the  learners  and
students  talking,  and  in  that  way,  through  our   own   findings   and
understanding of the situation, formulate a way to assist the department  in
realising the objectives of this programme and possibly try to come up  with
mechanisms that can assist in its successful implementation.

To conclude, the culture of educating and learning  has  taken  its  course.
Though here and there there are some hurdles that we hope to  overcome,  let
us join hands and commit ourselves to the future of this country  by  making
our education sector a success. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, I am now resolved  that  next  year,
if I am still here, I will not speak to introduce the Vote. I will  say  two
sentences and devote all the time to summing up and replying to the points.

I tried to  say  that  today  we  must  look  at  the  relationship  between
education and the provinces - the policy implications and  implementation  -
which is a function of the NCOP. The vast majority of people here did  that.
I got very valuable reports  from  the  provinces:  the  Eastern  Cape,  the
Northern Cape and Mpumalanga in particular. We missed Gauteng for  some  odd
reason. What we got from them was the richness of what they  are  doing  and
the real problems that they face.

I  now  have  the  information,  which  I  cannot  give  hon  members,  that
implementation on HIV/Aids, contrary to what  is  said  by  the  newspapers,
which are not here today, has been implemented in a remarkable way.  I  have
the statistics here. In one province they spent  the  provisional  grant  to
the tune of 102%. They found their own money. I only have 15 minutes, so  we
cannot look at much of this. KwaZulu-Natal spent 89% of provisional aid  for
HIV/Aids and Mpumalanga spent 123%. In other words, they put  in  their  own
money. The Northern Cape spent  150%.  They  put  their  own  money  in.  Of
course, the Western Cape spent 27% of their conditional grant  on  HIV/Aids.
The Eastern Cape spent 62%. Now, I hope the press will take this  on  board.
In addition, as we learnt, nearly every  province  has  supplemented  it  by
between R10 million and R15 million. These are  conditional  grants  that  I
negotiate, or my department negotiates, with central Government.

Let  us  look  at  the  remarkable  change  this   year   in   relation   to
infrastructure development. I have answered many questions  about  providing
sanitation, water  and  additional  classrooms.  This  year,  by  31  March,
according to official Treasury figures, the Eastern Cape had  spent  78%  of
the infrastructure grant, the Free State  59%,  Gauteng  42%,  KwaZulu-Natal
99%, Limpopo -  or  the  Northern  Province  -  108%,  Mpumalanga  96%,  the
Northern Cape 73%, the North West 60% and the  Western  Cape  97%.  We  must
keep this momentum going. These are basic.  Let  me  announce  the  figures.
Unless there is implementation, the provinces will not  get  the  additional
money. This year, there is  R500  million  for  infrastructure;  in  2001-02
there will be R1,1 billion; in 2002-03, R1,8 billion; and in  2003-04,  R2,1
billion. That is a 400% increase for infrastructure.

I do not want to be distracted by those who, like the Bourbons, have  learnt
nothing and forgotten everything. I am not going to be distracted  by  them.
My enemy, our collective enemy, is poverty.  Our  collective  enemy  is  the
disparity in the expenditure between formerly white institutions  and  black
institutions. Our enemy is inequality in the education system. Our enemy  is
the refused rejection of the apartheid principle that blacks should not,  as
Verwoerd said, increase their capacity beyond  a  certain  kind  of  labour.
That is my enemy, because there was no mathematics and science in the  rural
schools and township schools. We had to do it in  eight  years,  to  correct
something that colonialism and racism took 150 years to perpetuate. That  is
our enemy.

Our enemy is maladministration. Our enemy is  corruption.  Two  hon  members
dressed up their own prejudices as other people's  perceptions.  That  is  a
classic way of doing it, by saying that this is how other people perceive  a
situation. The hon member from the Western Cape must learn a little  bit  of
modesty as to how he presents things, by the way. The time is past  for  him
to make demands on democratic Ministers. He has lost  the  capacity  to  say
that he wants an assurance from a democratic Minister. He is  not  going  to
get that assurance, because he refuses  to  learn  that  we  are  committed,
because we drafted the provisions  for  diversity  and  multiculturalism  in
this country, not those hon  members.  We  drafted  the  provisions  of  our
mother-tongue instruction. I am not going to give  any  assurances  to  that
hon member, because we are practising it.

As for those who ask why English is being  favoured,  it  is  the  governing
body and the principal, whom the hon member supports so much, that decide  -
I  address  this  to  my  friend  from  KwaZulu-Natal  -  the  language   of
instruction in schools. The governing body says, for  its  own  reasons,  as
they do in Gauteng very often, that the  school's  children  want  to  learn
English. We oppose that in the national department. In the foundation  year,
one to three - it is not one to seven; that is  wrong  -  there  should  and
must be mother-tongue instruction.  That  is  the  basic  development.  From
mother-tongue instruction and proficiency one can move on to other things.

I am not going to be distracted. I want to talk about HIV/Aids.  I  want  to
be doing about HIV/Aids nationally. How much money are we  devoting  to  it?
UNAids says that our social protection programme on  HIV/Aids,  the  vaccine
of education, is the most advanced in the world. We are going to develop  it
further. We hope that we will spend - that is,  Health,  Social  Development
and Education together -  R1  billion  in  two  years'  time  on  the  whole
prevention approach.

Secondly, about violence and sexual abuse, I want hon members to  take  into
account that the only way to deal  with  sexual  abuse  is  to  have  proper
sexual education programmes at our schools. It is not an ideological  thing.
I understand why some people and fundamentalists of some  degree  would  say
that we want to encourage sexual promiscuity. Some politicians do  not  know
what happens on the ground. They really do not know. I think being  strident
and dressing up  prejudices  as  other  people's  perceptions  is  not  good
enough. There is an enormous  amount  of  sexually  precocious  activity  in
schools. I believe, as a grandfather and former  parent  of  schoolchildren,
that children must develop in their own way, in their own time in their  age
groups. Precocity is harmful to them.  But  our  society,  of  course,  with
instant gratification largely demanded  by  adults  -  sexual  and  material
gratification - gives the wrong example to our children, and we do not  give
them  the  comfort  and  the  love  that  they  often  find  in  the  sexual
experiences that children have.

Our slogan is, ``Protect the right to innocence of our  children.''  We  are
doing an enormous amount of work on this, and that is the way to  deal  with
HIV/Aids too. It is the right of women to say no. That is fundamental.  Once
one understands that no culture or background allows one to exploit women  -
often men use this idea of culture and of the  right  of  first  refusal,  I
think it is called - then one can accept  this,  but  women  must  have  the
right to say no. That is what we are proposing  in  our  school  system,  as
part of the built-in learning areas of  the  national  curriculum  statement
about sexuality in education. I would rather not go into the  idea  that  we
will now be going into oral sex or masturbation, as  we  have  been  accused
of. I ask hon members to read our learning area  statements.  That  is  very
important.

About school effectiveness and school fees, it is a  disgraceful,  appalling
indictment of both formerly white schools and formerly black schools that  a
school can reject a child because  of  an  inability  to  pay  fees.  It  is
legally laid down that if one earns less than  10  times  the  school  fees,
then one does not have to pay any fees at all. Then, of course, there  is  a
graduation there for all parents, and there should be no punishment  of  any
kind.

As for uniforms, I have always believed - and I have got  into  trouble  for
saying  so  -  that  uniforms  are  part  of  the   colonial   heritage   of
subordination and militarisation of our schools. What happens when  children
are very poor? What happens to the Aids orphans that  we  spoke  to,  16  of
them in our conference, who stay  at  home  in  their  hovels  because  they
cannot afford uniforms? What  happens  to  them?  An  extraordinarily  noble
principle is invoked. It is wonderful to see all these  kids  at  a  funeral
with expensive lined, colourful jackets, but there, in a way,  is  the  real
enemy: the enemy of the exclusion of the Aids orphans in their hovels.

I, as a humanitarian democrat, would support the right of that person to  go
to school without a uniform, and I do not  want  any  action  taken  against
her. I would believe that the MECs and the heads of departments are  failing
in their function if they do not  take  action  against  the  headmaster  or
teachers there. This is vital.

Regarding the school feeding scheme, I compliment Mr Raju  and  ask  him  to
give me the information. I  know  that  there  are  defects  in  the  school
feeding scheme, but it is the biggest antipoverty thing  that  we  have.  We
must look at where things are breaking down and we  must  be  introspective,
as some of the provinces have been. But two of the  hon  members  who  spoke
here refused to be introspective  about  the  values  in  their  educational
system. We are trying to do this. Exclusion and racism are the real  enemies
in our schools and universities. I do not want to be strident about this.  I
want to stay very calm. But we must all join  together  to  create  a  South
African culture. I opposed  Lord  Milner.  I  called  him  a  troglodyte.  I
presume hon members know what a troglodyte is. We do not want to  have  that
language here.

On Monday morning, on my public holiday, I am speaking to the  FF.  I  think
the FF is more entitled  to  say  that  they  are  speaking  for  6  million
Afrikaners than the hon Mr Van Niekerk is. [Interjections.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Why are they more entitled?

The MINISTER: I am speaking to the FF because they want me  to  speak  about
education, language and all those  issues.  They  are  not  accusing  me  of
trying to rape Afrikaans. Let me start with this. No vice  chancellor  of  a
former Afrikaans university has said they want  Afrikaans  to  be  a  single
medium of instruction. No  one  said  that  when  they  met  the  President.
Politicians,  for  their  own  populist  and  irredentist  reasons,  inflame
opinion and make those extraordinary statements. I give  an  assurance  that
we will carry out the  language  policy,  which  is  consistent  with  South
Africa and our needs.

Secondly, it is a much more fluid situation, if  hon  members  were  in  the
House when I answered that question  about  language  in  higher  education.
There are in Stellenbosch undergraduate courses taught  in  English  because
they want  to  attract  foreign  students.  They  are  pragmatic  about  it.
Otherwise  they  would  not  get  any  students  in  forestry.  Let  us  not
exaggerate this idea. Then, of course, in other places like  Pretoria,  they
have chosen their own approach to keep numbers in order to get  the  subsidy
from the national Government.

Thirdly, having said that, no  vice  chancellor  says,  ``We  want  to  keep
exclusively Afrikaans.'' Let us not confuse the matter with English. We  say
in the White Paper on our national plan that we want to  develop  indigenous
languages and we will give money for chairs, for example,  in  the  national
institute, if we can, to develop African  languages,  indigenous  languages.
That is very important.

I say in the national plan, which nobody else said, that  we  will  get  the
textbooks and dictionaries. There is no  reason  why  there  should  not  be
instruction in one of the indigenous languages at different universities.  I
have said publicly here that very few people are  studying  Afrikaans  as  a
language. Very few people are studying our indigenous  languages.  So  where
are the teachers going to come from? Where are the professors going to  come
from if very few people are studying these languages? That is what  the  hon
member should be talking about. He should be giving leadership  rather  than
retrogressing to the Bourbons and to the time  before  1994.  I  care  about
Afrikaans, and that is why I care about  foreign  languages.  I  care  about
indigenous  languages.  I  want  more  of  them  in  our  universities   and
institutions instead of that hon member's twaddle about my being  the  enemy
of Afrikaans. Leaders must give leadership, not run behind a prejudiced  and
bigoted flock.

That is why it is very important that we should talk  about  values  in  our
higher education system. We should talk about things like those the  members
have spoken about. I must reassure my sister from the  Free  State  that  no
one wants to ensure that black institutions suffer. There is no question  of
a merger between Qwaqwa and Bloemfontein. This was announced 15  months  ago
by the Cabinet. It is the incorporation of a small college 500 km away  from
Turfloop. That is what the architects of apartheid did. We are now  bringing
it together. The natural home is Bloemfontein.

We say in our National Plan for Higher Education and Cabinet  decision  that
the transformation of higher education  must  affect  every  institution  in
South Africa. If the hon member wants the details,  we  will  provide  them.
Therefore it is not about black institutions. We  are  going  to  merge  RAU
with Wits Technikon. We are going to merge them. Natal University  is  going
to merge with Durban-Westville. We are going to have dentistry move  to  the
University of the Western Cape. We are going to  build  up  Fort  Hare,  the
Western Cape and Limpopo  as  three  centres  of  excellence  where  we  can
develop black intellectuals. Every institution has to change its values  and
attitudes.

Let me say very categorically that I will publish my policy on  language  in
higher education. I  have  two  documents.  We  are  talking  about  access.
Medicine and engineering are about the  most  expensive  subjects  in  South
Africa. Why should 40 students, at great cost, have to go to Cuba to  become
doctors? We are  saying,  therefore,  that  in  the  expensive  areas,  like
medicine and engineering, there must be either  parallel  language  or  dual
language. If an hon member wants that demand to be made of UCT, if there  is
an opportunity for that demand, I will agree to it, but  most  Africans  are
comfortable in English, or have learnt it for five or six or ten  years.  If
Afrikaans is used as an exclusive method of  teaching  medicine,  that  will
exclude Africans.

Again I refer to our  national  plan,  which  the  new  vice  chancellor  of
Stellenbosch, who is much more understanding of South Africa than those  who
have lived here all  their  lives,  agrees  with,  as  we  have  said.  Poor
Afrikaners from the Northern Cape,  whom  the  hon  member  tends  to  speak
about, are not attracted by Stellenbosch.  They  do  not  make  any  special
attempt to get the poor Afrikaners, who  are  coloured,  from  the  Northern
Cape. My view is also that nobody cares for the  poor  Afrikaners  from  the
southern  suburbs  of  Johannesburg,  so  I  have  instructed  the  National
Financial Aid Scheme to say  that  poor  Afrikaners  must  now  be  assisted
there. Of that money, 94% goes to Africans, and we have 232 000 African  and
4 000 or 5 000 Afrikaners. But now we must emphasise this, because  we  are,
in the end, trying to achieve one community approach.  The  poor  Afrikaners
from the southern suburbs of Johannesburg must now be incorporated,  and  we
must make a way to get them there.

For example, only 12% of coloureds in the  18-24  age  group,  like  12%  of
Africans, go on to higher education. We must attract coloureds to go  there.
The universities, particularly the Afrikaans-speaking or  former  Afrikaans-
speaking universities, must go out of their way  to  say,  ``There  are  the
catchment areas for universities,'' but  not  the  catchment  areas  of  the
vineyards and Gauteng and Zebediela; they must go for the poor.

I am sorry that I have been deflected. I will try to answer  all  the  other
questions later, particularly the  questions  on  FET  are  very  important.
There is real development in FET.  I  have  given  the  answers  about  Abet
development. I think these are the real areas.  The  provinces  are  working
very well, but they will have to get more money.

Also very important, of course,  are  some  issues  that  fall  between  the
cracks. My friend Comrade Nogumla, who spoke  about  integrating  education,
raised a very important matter. I want pressure from  the  public  and  from
Parliament to say that all Government departments must work  together  where
the functions are overarching. We are doing that now  with  Aids,  involving
Social Development, Health and ourselves.
Elsewhere we have to come together and particularly ensure -  I  am  someone
who is not strident about this - that the money given  to  education  should
be used effectively. The Treasury has  taken  rationally  into  account  the
need for more money for early childhood education and other areas. It is  my
officials who, in fact, negotiate these matters with them. They  have  taken
into account that we cannot transform higher education without  more  money.
We cannot get more money if students are destructive. But we  must  remember
that the overwhelming majority of kids at primary and secondary school  want
education, want to be integrated into the system and want to  develop  their
own capacities.

When we started off five or six years ago, there was  violence  and  trouble
at every university, including the Vaal Triangle  and  Potchefstroom.  There
is  no  trouble  now,  because  we  have  begun  to  deal  with  them.   The
overwhelming majority of young people in higher education want  to  succeed.
We want to push them also into science  and  technology  and  into  history,
because hardly anyone learns history any more in higher education.  By  that
method, in fact, we will ensure that we get our growth in  our  economy  and
in human resources.

So we must salute the overwhelming majority of young people and  schoolkids,
particularly the primary schoolkids, the kids we saw here. We could see  the
self-assurance when they came in. It was not there five or  six  years  ago.
Whether they are white or black kids, the great hope is the  primary  school
system, because that is where the first  postapartheid  cohorts  are  coming
out. In two or three years' time they will be the full  cohorts  going  into
the secondary schools. I promise hon members that what they  saw  here  this
morning is what I will see when I go to a Soweto primary school,  to  Hector
Petersen primary school on Youth Day on Sunday morning, where I will  see  1
500 kids, largely from the  informal  dwellings,  and  they  are  the  great
inspiration for what we are doing. I hope  that  all  hon  members  will  be
inspired to say that this is the kind of value system we want to  create  in
South Africa.

People like us have been ghosts outside - excluded. We want  to  be  in  the
house now, but not exclusively, as happened until  1994.  We  want  to  work
with others, but they must be sensitive to our needs and aspirations and  to
the  development  of  our  languages.  My  own  language  is  dead,  through
apartheid, so I speak one language only. Apartheid killed  my  language.  It
did not kill it for other people because they had the national  strength  to
keep it alive. But we want the members  over  there  to  join  with  us  and
understand, but please not to use out-of-date approaches because  they  feel
they are being excluded. They must not feel that the  Government,  which  in
fact undertook the rights in this constitutional order, is against  them.  I
represent the vast majority of people in South Africa who want to ask  those
members to make the adjustment, to reach us, to work with us, and hope  that
in that process, the kind of protection they need will be enhanced.

They believed in group rights in negotiations up  to  1994,  but  I  believe
that group rights are destructive, that communities  in  South  Africa  like
the blacks, the Jews and the Indians never had group rights protection,  but
they protected their cultures and their  languages  and  their  inheritance.
One does not need the protection of the law to keep those dear and  to  keep
them with oneself.

The legalistic approach could be the bane of our society. We want social co-
operation, whether in religion or anywhere else. Religion  should  never  be
the basis of  exclusion  in  our  schools  or  of  a  lack  of  comfort  and
development in our schools. Our test is that every  child  and  every  young
person at school or university should feel comfortable.  I  think  that  the
developments we are involved in will increase the comfort zone.  I  ask  hon
members to join me in increasing that comfort zone. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 12:13.
