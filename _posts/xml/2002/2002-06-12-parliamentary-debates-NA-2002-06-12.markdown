                          LATE START OF PROCEEDINGS

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I do not believe that I have  to  apologise
for the late start today. [Applause.] Unfortunately,  the  collective  force
of our efforts did not succeed. Nonetheless, I am sure that we all,  in  the
House, wish Bafana Bafana well and think that  they  played  a  great  game.
[Applause.]

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M A MAZIYA: Chairperson, I give notice that on the  next  sitting  day  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Thabo Mbeki has called on the  rich  nations  at
       the World Food Summit in Rome to allow developing countries  to  have
       access to their markets, which is a key element to fight  hunger  and
       poverty;


  (2) believes that access  to  these  markets  will  lead  to  much-needed
       investment in agriculture and rural development, and that the goal of
       food security will be achieved;


  (3) echoes the call made by the President; and


  (4) calls on the rich countries to work towards  sustainable  livelihoods
       in the  rural  areas  of  the  developing  countries  by  encouraging
       investment in the agricultural sector.

[Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with distaste the offers made by the ANC  in  KwaZulu-Natal  to
       two senior DA members in an effort to induce them to cross the  floor
       to the ANC;


  (2) further notes that the ANC provincial chairperson, S'bu  Ndebele,  is
       making use of public servants to do his dirty work  in  contravention
       of the Public Service Act of 1994; and


  (3) deplores the desperate actions of the ANC, which is corruptly selling
       government jobs in return for opposition members handing  over  their
       seats to the power-hungry ANC.

Mr V B NDLOVU: Chair, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of  the
House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with delight that 442 Medium B prisoners at Rooigrond Prison in
       Mafikeng donated their day's food rations to homeless children;

       encouraging them not to commit crime but  to  get  an  education  and
       jobs;

  (4) thanks the Ministry of Correctional Services for  looking  after  the

           Presidency launched a campaign to encourage  young  people  with
           disabilities to speak out about their lives; and


       (b)  the voice of the young people with disabilities campaign is part
           of  the  OSDP's  national  awareness   plan   to   support   the
           implementation   of   the   Government's   Integrated   National
           Disability Strategy;


  (2) believes that people with  disability  have  rights,  which  must  be
       protected and upheld by all; and


  (3) welcomes the launch of this campaign as it will contribute positively
       to sensitising our people and the country to the experience of  young
       people living with disabilities.

[Applause.]

Mnr J J DOWRY: Mnr die Voorsitter, namens die Nuwe NP gee ek hiermee  kennis
dat ek op die volgende sittingsdag van die Huis gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met genoeë verneem van die bevindinge van die  2002  Initial  Quality
       Study deur die gesaghebbende Amerikaanse groep JD Powers & Associates
       dat die Rosslyn-aanleg van  BMW  in  Pretoria  motors  van  'n  beter
       gehalte lewer as selfs die moederfabrieke in Duitsland;


  (2) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  Rosslyn 10% van sy lonerekening aan  opleiding,  maar  spesifiek
           ook aan opvoeding, bestee vergeleke met die tussen 1% en 3%  van
           die meeste ander motorvervaardigers; en


       (b)  sy hoogs opgeleide en goed besoldigde werkers  en  vakbonde  dit
           begryp, en dat dit bewys dat jy nie  'n  wêreldspeler  kan  wees
           sonder om werk van die hoogste gehalte te verrig nie;


  (3) hulle gelukwens met hierdie prestasie en hul  nog  verdere  volgehoue
       sukses toewens; en


  (4) onderneem om maatreëls in te  stel  in  die  Staatsdiens  om  volgens
       dieselfde gesonde beginsels produktief diens van wêreldgehalte in die
       openbare sektor te lewer.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J J DOWRY: Mr Chairman, on behalf of the New NP  I  hereby  give  notice
that on the next sitting day of the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with pleasure the findings of the 2002 Initial Quality Study by
       the authoritative American group JD Powers and  Associates  that  the
       Rosslyn plant of BMW in Pretoria produces motorcars of an even better
       quality than the mother factories in Germany;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  Rosslyn spends 10% of its  wage  bill  on  training,  but,  more
           specifically, also on education, compared to between 1%  and  3%
           of most other motor vehicle manufacturers; and


       (b)  its highly trained and well-paid workers and  unions  understand
           this and that this proves that one  cannot  be  a  world  player
           without delivering work of the highest quality;


  (3) congratulates them  on  this  achievement  and  wishes  them  further
       sustained success; and


  (4) undertakes to introduce measures in the Public Service  according  to
       the same sound principles to  deliver  productive  service  of  world
       quality in the public sector.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, I give notice that I will move  on  behalf  of
the UDM at the next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that hunger, malnutrition and the  resultant  vulnerability  to
       disease, especially in the rural areas of our country  where  poverty
       prevails, are serious problems which impact negatively on the ability
       of our people to become productive participants in our economy;


  (2) recognises  and  welcomes  the  efforts  of  graphic  design  student
       Jonathan Edwards of Buffalo City in  designing  a  project  aimed  at
       assisting the rural  poor  with  small-scale  agricultural  activity,
       promoting food security;


  (3) salutes Jonathan Edwards and all South Africans actively involved  in
       reaching out and empowering less fortunate South Africans; and


  (4) calls upon all South Africans to emulate this noble deed.

Mr A MLANGENI: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next  sitting  of  the
House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Mr Wally Muller, a former coach of the  Gauteng  Cricket  Board,
           passed away on Sunday, 9 June 2002; and


       (b)  Mr Muller played a pivotal role in the development of cricket in
           Gauteng in his capacity as Bakers Mini Cricket co-ordinator  for
           Gauteng province, liaison officer in the Under-19 World  Cricket
           Cup in 1998 for the SA team  and  as  assistant  coach  for  the
           Gauteng youth team that toured Kenya in 1999;


  (2) acknowledges the role Mr Wally Muller played in  the  development  of
       cricket; and


  (3) expresses its deepest condolences to his family, his friends and  his
       colleagues.

[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chair, I give notice that I will move on behalf  of  the  ACDP
at the next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe, has again been  at  the
           centre of global attention at  the  United  Nations  World  Food
           Summit in  Rome,  where  he  became  the  target  of  blistering
           criticism for his objectionable governance  and  land  policies;
           and


       (b)   he  also  came  under  fire  for  his  government's  food   aid
           distribution patterns, in which he is  accused  of  feeding  his
           supporters only and not giving aid to those people perceived  to
           be members of the opposition;


  (2) calls on the South African Government to take heed of these concerns,
       as well as those expressed by the Danish Doctors for Human Rights, to
       ensure that there is no discrimination regarding the distribution  of
       food aid in Zimbabwe; and


  (3) expresses its heartfelt concern regarding the  severe  hardships  and
       suffering experienced by Zimbabweans at his time.

[Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Chairman, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  I
shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its distaste at the hypocrisy of  President  Robert  Mugabe
       who, despite the EU travel ban, is attending the UN  Food  Summit  in
       Italy while he encourages his supporters at home to invade commercial
       farms and destroy Zimbabwe's ability to produce food;
  (2) notes that an estimated 5 million Zimbabweans are  on  the  verge  of
       starvation;


  (3) calls on President Mbeki and his Nepad partners to have  the  courage
       of their convictions and act against the Mugabe  government,  in  the
       interests of the survival of all Zimbabweans and  also  to  save  the
       Nepad initiative.

Mr L M KGWELE: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting  I  shall
move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the statement by the Minister of Education, the hon Prof  Kader
       Asmal, that teachers should not take up teaching posts overseas under
       the pretext of taking long leave or sick leave;


  (2) believes that this practice disrupts the entire schooling process and
       does not contribute positively to building an efficient public school
       system which responds to the developmental needs of the  country  and
       its people; and


  (3) calls on teachers to desist from this  behaviour  and  to  work  with
       Government  and  stakeholders  towards  a  nonracial,  nonsexist  and
       dynamic education system for all.

Mr B G BELL: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that at the  next  sitting  I
shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  some Mpumalanga MECs continue to be paid between R5 000  and  R8
           000 a month for staying in their own houses; and


       (b)  other legislature members live rent-free in flats  paid  for  by
           taxpayers;


  (2) expresses its shock that the provincial Cabinet has approved a scheme
       to build luxury accommodation  for  politicians  at  a  cost  of  R53
       million; and


  (3) calls on the ANC in Mpumalanga to stop milking the taxpayers for self-
       gain and commit themselves to serving the people who  are  really  in
       need.

[Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) takes delight in the co-operation the  community  of  Khayelitsha  is
       giving to the police when they investigate crimes;


  (2) notes that this co-operation has seen many criminals  being  arrested
       and taking responsibility for their crimes; and


  (3) believes and hopes that other communities in other areas will emulate
       this culture of rounding up the criminals strategically so that  they
       could be wiped out of society.

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next  sitting  I  shall
move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  inmates at the Rooigrond Prison in Mafikeng donated their  day's
           food rations to homeless children last Tuesday;


       (b)  the inmates staged a play for children,  showing  them  life  in
           prison; and


       (c)  the message of  the  play  was  ``don't  commit  crime,  get  an
           education and then a job''; and


  (2) commends the Department of Correctional Services  in  the  North-West
       and the inmates for embarking on this good cause.

[Applause.]

Mr F J VAN DEVENTER: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the strike action by Cosatu against violence on trains is to  go
           ahead on Thursday, with the inclusion of  the  SA  Clothing  and
           Textile Workers Union;


       (b)  violence on  trains  is  unacceptable  and  is  a  deterrent  to
           sustained economic growth if dealt with in the  manner  proposed
           by the labour movement;


       (c)  the intention by Cosatu is definitely not the solution,  as  the
           implementation of the safety regulator will provide the  impetus
           for greater safety on trains; and


       (d)  the intended  strike  may  have  enormous  implications  for  an
           already fragile economy within the Western Cape and will have  a
           negative effect on issues like unemployment, income distribution
           and poverty alleviation; and


  (2) calls upon Cosatu and the Government to go back to the table to enter
       into meaningful dialogue to resolve the issue of train safety in  the
       best interests of all the stakeholders.

Mrs N C NKABINDE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at  the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) is outraged at the decision  of  the  Minister  of  Health,  the  hon
       Tshabalala-Msimang, to stall  the  R800  million  international  Aids
       grant intended for KwaZulu-Natal on the  spurious  grounds  that  the
       provincial health authorities had not  followed  proper  channels  of
       communication;


  (2) views the Minister's preoccupation with bureaucratic procedures as  a
       callous disregard for life because the protocol she insists  on  will
       result in a costly delay in terms of health and life; and


  (3) calls on the Minister  to  regard  the  Aids  crisis  as  a  national
       emergency whose cost in lives amounts to a state of war  and  should,
       therefore, be addressed as such by withdrawing her stalling  measures
       and allowing the grant to reach the KwaZulu-Natal Aids victims.

[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, I give notice that on the  next  sitting  of  the
House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  President Bakil Muluzi of Malawi is  seeking  a  third  term  in
           office and that the  ruling  party  is  seeking  to  change  the
           constitution accordingly; and


       (b)  these attempts to change the constitution have attracted  large-
           scale protests in  the  streets,  as  well  as  from  local  and
           international  bodies  and  organisations,  namely,  the  Malawi
           Council of Churches,  the  Muslims  and  the  Council  for  Non-
           Governmental Organisations of Malawi, who are in agreement  that
           the constitutional change should not occur and have voiced their
           opposition; and


  (2) in view of the aforementioned, calls upon our Government to  use  its
       influence in the region and with the government of Malawi to  express
       its concern and opposition to the proposed constitutional changes.

                      CONGRATULATIONS TO BAFANA BAFANA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Bafana Bafana lost 3-2 in a match  against  Spain  in  the
       World Cup competition in Daejeon, South Korea;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  Bafana Bafana displayed excellent talent and  played  world  cup
           matches diligently in a competition where  the  world  champion,
           France, was eliminated; and


       (b)  Bafana Bafana have represented our country  admirably  and  have
           served as an inspiration to all our people, young and old; and


  (3) congratulates Bafana Bafana on their splendid performance in the 2002
       World Cup soccer competition in Daejeon, South Korea.

Ndizani Bafana Ndizani.

Agreed to.

   RATIFICATION OF DECISION OF JOINT PROGRAMME SUBCOMMITTEE TO FAST-TRACK
                            FLOOR-CROSSING BILLS

                             (Draft Resolution)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  draft
resolution in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House ratifies the decision the Joint Programme Subcommittee  on
  11 June 2002 took in accordance with Joint Rule 216(2), namely  that  the
  Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Bill [B 17B
  - 2002]  (National  Assembly  -  sec  74),  Local  Government:  Municipal
  Structures Amendment Bill [B 22B - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 75) and
  Loss or Retention of Membership of National and  Provincial  Legislatures
  Bill [B 25 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 76) be fast-tracked by, where
  necessary, shortening any period within which any step in the legislative
  process relating to the Bills must be completed,  in  order  to  make  it
  possible for the Bills to  be  passed  by  Tuesday,  18  June  2002  (see
  Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports, 11 June 2002, p 652).

Agreed to.
                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 2 - Parliament:

The SPEAKER: Mr Chairperson, I have just been asked if the hon  members  are
allowed to heckle. I cannot call members to order, so they should feel  free
to do so! [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

At the risk of spoiling the lovely time that  some  people  think  they  are
going to have, I want  to  begin  with  the  bad  news,  i.e  the  immediate
financial and  organisational  challenges  that  face  this  institution  in
arresting the deleterious impact of scarce  resources  on  our  capacity  to
function.

This year, Parliament had submitted  a  budget  which,  at  R498,5  million,
exceeded the MTEF guideline by R52 million. However, we were advised by  the
Treasury that the amount approved was  only  a  little  over  R469  million,
which, though R23 million above the MTEF guideline,  is  still  R28  million
less than the amount requested.
How do we now make further  cuts,  even  as  members  are  asking  for  more
resources? More importantly, in the years ahead, how do we move forward  and
acquire the resources that will enable the  transformation  and  development
of Parliament?

In January, the Presiding Officers submitted a report  to  the  Joint  Rules
Committee on the problems of  preparing  the  budget  submission,  and  drew
attention to the deficit. The presiding officers  invited  the  Joint  Rules
Committee to recommend remedies. Four and a half months later  we  have  not
received a single comment nor any recommendation from  any  political  party
or member of the committee. At the following  meeting  of  the  Joint  Rules
Committee, in this term, parties indicated that they had  not  had  time  to
consider our report and discuss the issues.

There have, however, been numerous  requests  to  authorise  additional  and
necessary expenditure for members' facilities and other matters.

I would like to quote from our report  to  the  JRC  on  the  views  of  the
Minister of  Finance,  expressed  during  his  meeting  with  the  presiding
officers:


  The Minister repeated his previous concern at the  absence  of  a  vision
  linked to a strategy and costs. He also indicated that he held  the  view
  that members required  improved  support  to  strengthen  their  work  in
  committees and to enhance their interaction with the  different  function
  areas.

The report continues:


  He stated that it was vital for Parliament to develop a plan  to  utilise
  as its strategic vision for the next few years. Such a plan could then be
  the basis for our next submission.

I am convinced that should Parliament put forward its  vision  and  strategy
with a budget, we would receive a favourable  response  within,  of  course,
the national resources available. This is the third occasion  on  which  the
Minister expressed this view. I have also previously  recommended  a  5-year
programme cycle, to accommodate the changes due to elections.

However, in the absence of any interest from members and political  parties,
who is going to engage in defining a strategic vision and when? And to  what
extent are we able to improve our budget process?

The democratic changes that we have brought to this institution  bring  both
responsibility and obligations. It is,  therefore,  incumbent  on  political
parties to so organise their members and political  responsibilities  as  to
allow time to carry out these traditional obligations.

Unless we are able to do this,  there  will  continue  to  be  a  vacuum  in
important areas, and the management  and  organisation  of  Parliament  will
inevitably leave much to be desired. The delays last year  in  dealing  with
Parliament's budget by ourselves is merely one example.

However, I said bad news came first. We have achieved a great  deal  and  no
one can deny that we have managed the transition to a democratic  Parliament
quite smoothly. In 1994 there was little time to redesign all  institutions,
least of all this one.

We expanded our representative base and quickly learnt how  to  operate  and
function within the existing institution.  We  also  democratised  decision-
making in the management of this institution, including the  budget.  In  an
ad hoc way, we did much more and we must take credit for  our  achievements.
In many cases we have  gone  further  with  transformation  than  the  long-
established democratic parliaments have been able to do.

But simply running an old institution more democratically and by new  people
is not enough. Nine years on, we need to consider the organisational  design
of Parliament and its operation, and assess these  in  the  context  of  the
founding principles of our Constitution.
We have successfully managed an incredible legislative workload  every  year
since 1994, averaging  over  100  Bills  a  year  and  180  since  the  1999
elections. However, we must  question  how  many  amendments  arose  because
legislation was poorly drafted, not properly conceived or  thought  through,
or implementation problems not properly  anticipated.  Initially,  this  was
understandable,  but  by  now  the  executive  and  Parliament  should  have
overcome the early problems.

Over 50% of the legislation presented to Parliament consists of  amendments,
though a more  thorough  analysis  is  necessary.  We  are  programming  our
workload  much  more  efficiently  than  before,  and  committees  and   the
executive are meeting deadlines.

The Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of Committees,  the  hon  Doidge  and
Cassim, are being provided with more conducive working space  and  staff  to
manage and assist the work of committees. There is  a  need  to  review  the
committee section, its organisation, and the number and capacity  of  staff.
The legal services of Parliament should have the capacity to advise  on  the
constitutionality of legislation and drafting.

Committee organisation and functions need examination. Committees should  be
able to plan and set programmes within priorities and mandates  set  by  the
National Assembly. We also need to  empower  them  through  subject-specific
training  for  members,  and  appropriate  research  support.  They   cannot
continue to function mainly on the basis of information that is supplied  by
the departments they are required to oversee.

It is iniquitous to give each committee the same funding, regardless of  its
workload. The same applies to allocation of time, and  the  assumption  that
all committees should sit simultaneously throughout the year.

The recommendations of the National Assembly Workshop on Committees need  to
be taken further and the Rules re-examined once policy is agreed.

Committees are also expected to exercise oversight. The ad hoc committee  on
this subject should be making  its  final  report  shortly,  and  this  will
provide an opportunity for the Rules Committee and  the  House  to  consider
changes.

A  proper   assessment   of   accountability   and   oversight   under   our
constitutional principles may help  us  to  shift  away  from  the  constant
confrontation and electoral politics that characterises our debates in  this
regard.

The problems of Scopa have, unfortunately, been  debated  primarily  in  the
media. The committee has been mired in controversies around the  arms  deal.
Is it not time this House looked  at  and  considered  the  functioning  and
workload of this committee, not in the interests of a particular party,  but
in relation to the constitutional obligations of this House?

Oversight  of  the  institutions  established  under  Chapter   9   of   the
Constitution and bodies  established  under  legislation  also  need  to  be
reviewed, for Parliament has no mechanisms for performing this function.

Further,  the  democratic  South  Africa  has  not   only   re-entered   the
international arena, but is now also playing  a  significant  role  in  many
organisations  and  has  made  numerous  commitments  and  agreements.  This
Parliament needs to consider and establish proper mechanisms for  monitoring
and oversight. There is a great deal of international  experience  on  which
we can draw. The Working Group on the African Union is examining  this,  and
will be  tabling  recommendations.  The  research  and  information  of  the
working group will have to  be  applied  to  all  areas  of  South  Africa's
international involvement.

One of our achievements is the way we have organised ourselves on the  basis
of inclusivity, from seating arrangements in  the  Chamber  to  the  fullest
participation in all our proceedings. In 1994 we had six parties,  today  we
have  thirteen.  After  yesterday's  adoption  of  legislation  facilitating
crossing the floor, I will not venture to comment on the number  of  parties
in the House in a month's time! [Interjections.] However, when  we  consider
the practices  elsewhere  which  limit  participation  by  parties  under  a
minimum threshold, we have been very democratic and impose no barriers.

Of course the smaller parties do complain, as on occasion does the  majority
party. But there is one issue of inclusiveness that  does  need  to  be  re-
examined. I am referring to the allocation  of  speaking  time  in  debates.
This is arranged by agreement among the parties,  and  is  proportionate  to
the number of elected representatives.

However, there are few, if any, amongst us in the House who can emulate  the
brevity or the poetry of  the  great  writer  who  encapsulated  the  entire
miracle of changing water into wine at a wedding  feast  into  a  mere  nine
words: ``The Lord looked upon the water and it blushed.''

Would anyone seriously suggest that the views of any political  party  on  a
major issue can be expressed in nine words  or  in  two  or  three  minutes?
[Applause.] Yet, this is the time we allow the smaller  parties.  Surely  if
we are serious about debating issues we must find a better way  of  managing
this. [Applause.] And I would look to  smaller  parties  to  make  proposals
that accommodate also the needs of the larger parties.

Let us be mindful that we are  setting  precedents  and  practices  for  the
future. Parties who assume  they  will  have  increasing  support  at  every
election do so at their  own  peril.  Support  can  rise  or  fall,  and  in
democracies majorities and minorities are transient. [Applause.]

It is, therefore, in the interest of all parties, and of democracy, that  we
build inclusivity and best democratic practice into our work,  even  at  the
possible cost of immediate party interests.

The establishment of a Pan-African Parliament, which  will  probably  happen
this  year,  will  impose  a  further  workload  on  members,  as  does  our
increasing  involvement  in  international  organisations.  We  do  have  to
rethink our international obligations to take on board our  greater  involve
in Africa and make adequate provision in our programmes.

While we have programmed our legislative workload  more  effectively,  there
is no common view among parties  on  the  activities  to  which  MPs  should
devote their time, and on the priorities.

We have agreed there should be provision for  committee  and  plenary  work,
family time and constituency work. We  try  to  accommodate  these  in  each
term. However, should we be functioning on the basis that  MPs  will  return
to their  constituencies  each  weekend  and  that  Parliament  should  make
provision for this in terms of tickets and working hours in Parliament?

Further, the constituency system that we  have  established  does  not  take
into account the  proportional  representation  system  and  the  fact  that
representative  legislatures  are  no  longer  the  domain   of   individual
representatives, but of political parties. It may well be that  we  formally
acknowledge this by allocating additional  resources  to  political  parties
which they can use to establish  offices  or  do  political  work  with,  of
course, with stringent accounting and auditing requirements. This  would  be
to replace the constituency allowances that are now being provided.

Parliament also needs to  expand  its  own  public  education  and  outreach
programmes, including the possible establishment of  parliamentary  offices.
Members of all parties would need to be involved in this  work  as  part  of
their parliamentary responsibilities. Matters such  as  this  would  clearly
best be considered after the Slabbert committee has reported  and  a  future
electoral system has been determined. We may need to come back  to  specific
proposals later this year.

I wish to return to the budget and the way in which  we  manage  Parliament.
There is a contradiction between the responsibilities  allocated  under  the
PMFA and our current Rules.  We  cannot  allocate  legal  responsibility  to
officials or to office bearers which,  in  terms  of  the  Rules,  they  are
unable  to  fulfil.  The  new  legislation  that  will  seek  to  apply  the
requirements of the PMFA to Parliament will  have  to  look  into  this  and
amend either the Rules or the  Bill.  The  same  would  apply  to  financial
provisions within the powers and privileges legislation.

Notwithstanding the severe limitations on staff arising  in  part  from  the
administration bearing the main burden of budgetary constraints -  and  they
have - generally there is pride in  this  institution  among  staff  at  all
levels and their unions. I want to thank them for their  efforts.  I  should
thank in particular the Secretary to the National Assembly,  the  Table  and
all those who contribute directly to the smooth running of the Assembly  and
the comfort of members.

Finally, to the Secretary and Deputy  Secretary  and  all  staff  for  their
efforts at improving the support services, our appreciation and good  wishes
for their efforts. My appreciation and thanks go to the Deputy Speaker,  and
I thank her particularly for her effort  throughout  the  year.  I  wish  to
advise members that she has not had one day's leave this year so far.

In this coming year we need to address the issues I  have  raised  and  many
others that I have not. They need to be integrated into a programme for  the
end of this second Parliament and the beginning of the next. I would  advise
members that elections are within the  next  two  years.  This  will  impose
additional burdens on members and staff at a time  when  we  will  not  have
adequate resources. I believe, however, it is the only way we would be  able
to empower this institution - if we make adequate provisions now.  That  way
we will also empower members to  fulfil  their  role  in  consolidating  and
entrenching democracy in South Africa. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, when our  people  elected
us into public office, they bestowed  upon  us  a  specific  responsibility.
That responsibility  is  to  create,  through  this  public  institution,  a
peaceful and prosperous South African nation.

It is for this reason that the  ANC  identified  Parliament  as  a  site  of
struggle. This institution has positioned itself on the one hand as  a  home
for the poor, ie people who die from curable  diseases,  and  on  the  other
hand as an institution that represents those who die from having  enough  to
eat. We dedicate this speech to the 1976 generation of youth  who  took  the
frontline in the struggle against apartheid and contributed to  bringing  an
end to white minority rule. It is also a dedication to  thousands  of  youth
volunteers  who  have  recently  taken  it  upon  themselves  to  work  with
Government in building a better life for our people,  to  ensure  that  this
century becomes an African century.

Lastly, this speech is a dedication  to  the  late  hon  Peter  Mokaba,  who
understood the essence of humanity.  For  this  reason  he,  throughout  his
life, remained steadfast and committed to building  a  nonracial,  nonsexist
South Africa.

We  are  now  in  the  eighth  year  of  assuming  the  leadership  of  this
institution. This Budget Vote gives us an opportunity to interrogate  as  to
whether we are meeting our mandate.  In  this  year  of  the  volunteer  for
reconstruction and development, we are charged with  the  responsibility  of
ensuring a tight link between Parliament and  our  people.  This  emphasises
ongoing sensitisation and consciousness  on  our  part  as  legislators,  in
passing pieces of legislation that have a positive impact  in  changing  the
lives of South Africans.

The manner in which we commit resources for the overall functioning of  this
institution must be reflective of our political objectives. In  this  regard
we must recognise and acknowledge the role that committees have to  play  in
exercising an oversight function of Parliament over the  executive.  Members
of Parliament have a political  mandate  to  execute,  therefore  resourcing
appropriately is necessary. Members of Parliament  must  be  resourced  from
secretarial and research support to members' facilities. [Interjections.]

Concerns have been expressed with regard to slow  progress  in  implementing
developing legislation on Parliament's role  in  the  budget.  However,  the
operations of the envisaged budget committee as  per  the  dictates  of  the
Constitution will collapse unless resourcing and empowerment  of  committees
is addressed. Resourcing committees  and  members  would  give  an  adequate
expression to this institution of being a people's Parliament.

On  the  other  hand,  resourcing  committees  and  members  of   Parliament
adequately will have to be met by the necessary  level  of  commitment  from
individual  members  and  committees  to  do  our  work   with   dedication,
commitment and a sense of duty. In this context, we have to  strengthen  the
committees' oversight function. We must ensure that  scheduled  meetings  do
take place. We must also improve the level of  debating  in  committees,  as
well as in this House.

I would also just like to comment on the question of  public  participation.
We do need to interact with this very same question quite seriously.  Public
participation cannot  be  for  those  who  have  money  to  come  to  public
hearings. It is an issue that we need to address. [Applause.] Otherwise,  it
will be the same as perpetuating the saying: ``He who pays the piper,  calls
the tune'' or something like that. [Interjections.]

This brings us to another  issue  with  regard  to  discipline.  If  we  are
serious enough about our work and understand our political  obligations,  we
will know that we cannot afford  to  be  ill-disciplined  in  executing  our
work. This is one area that, as parties  and  individuals,  members  do  not
have to tolerate at all. This should include the conduct of  members  during
debates and general behaviour in the House.

We are happy that Madam Speaker and the Joint Rules Committee moved  that  a
resolution be  taken  on  imposing  fines  on  those  who  think  that  this
Parliament deserves to be treated with disdain  and  contempt.  The  ANC  is
also considering a similar measure for its members in Parliament and,  as  a
matter of fact, the ANC caucus took an effective decision  in  this  regard.
The ANC will make further public announcements  regarding  this  matter.  We
want to make an appeal to all members to treat this House with  the  respect
it deserves. We must never lose sight of our political obligations.

We take pride in the role that  Parliament  is  beginning  to  play  in  the
Southern African region. It was encouraging in the forum of African  leaders
in Ghana, two months ago, to see  that  the  South  African  Parliament  and
Government  take  the  principle  of  accountability  seriously.  This   was
displayed by the fact that the  South  African  Parliament  appeared  to  be
ahead  on  issues  such  as  the  African  Union  and  Nepad,  whilst  other
parliaments  on  the  continent  appeared  to   have   heard   about   these
particularly important development initiatives  through  the  media  and  so
forth. We will be holding a meeting of African  parliaments  on  28  and  29
June 2002 in preparation of the launch of the African Union in July 2002.

This Parliament carries this responsibility guided by the need to develop  a
culture of human rights, promoting development  and  a  cultural  solidarity
between governments and peoples of the world. The critical precondition  for
the success of Nepad is the need to mobilise the masses  of  the  people  on
the continent to rally behind the  vision  of  Nepad.  Parliament  plays  an
important role in this regard.

Our predecessors in this theatre performed dutifully, from the  Luthulis  to
the Mandelas and the De Klerks. The  South  Africa  we  have  today  is  the
product and a reflection  of  our  people's  yearning  for  a  peaceful  and
prosperous nation. Our people  continue  to  redefine  themselves  as  human
beings, the emphasis being the need  to  reconcile  our  people  across  the
colour line and the need to eliminate poverty and  underdevelopment.  It  is
only in this context that the current reconfiguration of  political  parties
has to be understood. Our desire, and commitment to our  people,  to  foster
national unity has to be matched by how we conduct  ourselves  as  political
parties and individuals in this House.

Our history presents us with a huge challenge. All of us have  a  collective
duty in this Parliament to fight poverty, to  fight  social  prejudices  and
stereotypes among our people. We have  to  fight  economic  underdevelopment
and backwardness. We must defeat the scourge of diseases. The noble wish  of
the people is to have a South Africa that proudly takes its  rightful  place
in the family of nations. Therefore, our day to day conduct  and  commitment
has to reflex this sense of political obligation. Let us work in the  manner
that will give our future generation a sense of pride and joy. [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, the debate  on  this  Vote  has  traditionally
been an uncontroversial affair. The Whips say nice things about  each  other
and about the presiding officers and everybody feels a little  better.  This
year I intend being a little controversial.

Since 1999 the ANC seems to have watered down its commitment  to  Parliament
and to carrying out its constitutional role  of  holding  the  executive  to
account. In many subtle ways, Parliament has faded a little as the  ultimate
repository of power and the voice of the people. There seems to have been  a
movement towards a greater concentration  of  power  in  the  hands  of  the
executive, with a loss of power and authority by Parliament.

Many able parliamentarians have left the National Assembly and the  turnover
is quite startling. In the previous era it was  estimated  that  an  average
member of parliament served for about seven and a half  years.  The  average
an MP now seems to serve is four or five years before moving  on.  There  is
an inevitable loss of experience, expertise and institutional memory.

Some of the brightest and the best in the ANC came to the National  Assembly
in 1994. One can see that not everybody grew up wanting to be a  politician.
Many feel happier in business or elsewhere,  and  those  who  moved  to  the
private sector have often become  quite  rich,  in  some  cases  exceedingly
rich, in a very short space of time.

Many of the replacements seem a little out of their depth, and  the  overall
quality of members has not risen in the past few years. Some  of  those  who
have a reputation for independence  of  mind  seem  to  be  crushed  by  the
pressures to conform. They either conform or else they leave.

Joining a long line of able people who turned away from Parliament is  Pregs
Govender. She is an  independent  spirit  and  an  energetic  and  dedicated
worker, and ... [Interjections] ... I think it is very sad  that  Parliament
has lost the services of a member of this calibre. One might not agree,  but
is it coincidental that she came out in open opposition to  the  ANC's  Aids
policy? She will be remembered  for  the  role  she  played  in  helping  to
persuade the President to see sense.

Another indication of the marginalisation is the attitude of  the  President
himself to the National Assembly. He was elected by Parliament, not  by  the
people, but he feels no need to make regular appearances  here.  President's
question time has become a rare occasion, and this year we are going  to  be
lucky to have him  answer  questions  on  three  occasions.  This  is  quite
clearly inadequate in a parliamentary democracy.
And what about question time itself? This has deteriorated  alarmingly.  For
the Official Opposition it has been an exercise in coping  with  the  legacy
of Mr Tony Yengeni. It was his aim to ensure that the  DP  could  no  longer
dominate question time. The Rules were changed and  we  have  an  artificial
situation that question time, unlike in every other parliamentary  democracy
in the world, belongs more to the Government and the  governing  party  than
it does to anyone  else.  If  the  people  on  the  Government  benches  had
independent-minded people who would ask searching questions,  one  might  be
able to justify it. But, unfortunately, most  of  the  Government  questions
are what is known as ``sweetheart questions''.

The miserable debacle surrounding Scopa added to the marginalisation.  I  am
not going to reiterate my party's views about the poor handling of the  arms
deal issue, but I suspect that Scopa has suffered mortally. Whether it  will
recover its performance function remains to be seen. The  Government  did  a
shabby deal with Mr Van Schalkwyk, and appointed a young man  from  the  New
NP to be the so-called independent chairperson of Scopa. The jury is out  on
whether that chairperson, whom I like personally, has it  in  him  to  apply
the vigour and the rigour which the position demands.

Scopa is operating on  one  wing  only.  The  Government  and  the  Official
Opposition attend its meetings, and one or two other  parties.  All  of  the
rest seem  to  stay  away.  If  anything  underscores  the  emasculated  and
pathetic travesty of what a public  accounts  committee  should  be,  it  is
that.

Another illustration of this has been  the  unseemly  show  surrounding  the
Immigration Bill. The ANC played politics with this Bill  year  after  year.
The ANC was determined to pass its own Bill, not one which the  Minister  of
Home Affairs could claim credit for. We voted for the Bill, knowing that  it
was an improvement on the  past.  But,  nevertheless,  a  travesty  and  hon
members know that as well.

Minister Erwin interceded and tried  to  have  it  redrafted.  But,  despite
this, it was pushed through  the  National  Council  of  Provinces,  and  an
unworkable Bill had gone through both Houses and has to be amended in  order
to become workable. What sort of image does this convey to  the  world?  The
good name and reputation of our Parliament suffered.

There are many of us here, from all parties, who care about  Parliament.  It
is not only  my  party  that  cares  about  Parliament.  We  do  care  about
Parliament. [Interjections.] We want it strengthened. We want  it  to  be  a
successful expression of the  democratic  will  of  our  people  because  if
Parliament is damaged, we hurt our own people. We hurt the people  of  South
Africa if  this  Place  suffers.  There  is  a  duty  on  us  to  strengthen
Parliament and live up to the high promise of our Constitution.

I thank the Whips of all parties with whom I co-operate, and I  congratulate
the hon Nathi Nhleko on his election as Chief Whip. He is  the  fifth  Chief
Whip I have had to contend with. And while the rapidity of change  might  be
entertaining, I want to urge  the  ANC  not  to  change  again  too  quickly
because this is bad for Parliament. Mr Nhleko is a friendly and  intelligent
man, and I am sure that he and I will co-operate well. And I certainly  wish
him well. [Interjections.]

My thanks go to all of the Presiding  Officers  and  all  of  the  staff  of
Parliament, in management and at every level throughout,  from  the  highest
to the lowest, and back up again. I thank them  for  their  efforts  because
without them this place would not function and the people's  business  would
not be attended to. [Applause.]

Mr M J MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I wish, first of all, to  say  congratulations
to you in your new post. I did not have time to congratulate you and I  wish
you well in your new post. I think you will do very well.

Let me remind hon members, especially hon Gibson, that if the  ANC  did  not
care about Parliament, I do not think that  he  would  have  stood  at  this
podium today and argued his case. [Applause.] The ANC  has  been  very  able
and it takes Parliament very  seriously  in  whatever  it  does.  Parliament
would not have been transformed to the extent it has been  if  the  ANC  did
not care enough to take transformation forward. So the  ANC  does  care  and
the ANC knows what it is doing. [Applause.]

Secondly, I want to respond again to the  hon  Gibson.  We  should  be  very
proud of our President, who comes into this  House,  takes  the  podium  and
answers questions satisfactorily, and he does not just answer questions  and
then go. Our President does appear before this House.  How  many  Presidents
in the whole world take the  podium  and  are  accountable  to  the  public?
[Applause.]

How many Presidents in the whole world really go out to the public,  address
imbizos, talk to the people and listen to the problems of  the  people,  and
then come back to the House and urge all members of Parliament  to  do  some
work in their constituencies? [Applause.] How many such presidents does  one
get? One does not find them anywhere. Therefore, the ANC does  care  and  is
doing a very, very good job. And we are proud of the job we are doing.

I am sorry that I addressed these issues first, but let me come back to  the
Budget Vote itself.

Parliament is the highest law-making institution in the country. Members  of
Parliament  are  the  custodians  of  the  aspirations  of  voters  and  are
defenders of the democratic processes.

The aim of this Budget Vote is  to  provide  support  services  required  by
Parliament  to  fulfil  its  constitutional  function  to  assist  political
parties represented in Parliament to secure administrative support,  service
constituencies  and  provide  members  of  Parliament  with  the   necessary
facilities.

The strategic overview and key policy developments for the medium  term  put
strong emphasis on the development and training of  members  and  staff.  To
this  effect,  performance  contracts  between  staff   and   managers   are
introduced for the first time in  2002.  We  need  to  thank  the  Presiding
Officers for that.  We  can  see  that  we  are  taking  our  training  very
seriously.

The Office of the Secretary to Parliament will play a stronger role  in  co-
ordinating the activities of Parliament over the medium term. The  financial
allocation to the Office of the Secretary grows by 5% in the year 2002-03.

Since the inception of the democratic Parliament of South  Africa  in  1994,
parliamentary committees started to  play  a  vital  role  in  parliamentary
processes. The committees can be regarded as representing  the  House.  They
enjoy, to a large extent,  the  same  powers  as  the  House,  for  example,
freedom of speech.

The most important role of committees, on the  other  hand,  is  to  develop
expertise to gather information and  to  do  the  detailed  work  that  must
underpin properly informed decisions about  public  policy.  Committees  are
substructures of the House. They do not take decisions, but the House  does.
It is, therefore, important that  Parliament's  budget  should  continue  to
support committees in dealing with their  work  in  Parliament  and  outside
Parliament.

Public participation was mentioned by the hon Chief Whip, and  it  was  also
touched on by Madam Speaker, I think,  in  her  speech.  We  are  very  much
concerned about this. I think all of us, not just committees, should  invite
people to public hearings. But, as we  go  out  to  our  constituencies  out
there, we should make it a point that we  visit  those  small  villages  and
extend Parliament to our people in the constituencies.  We  should  talk  to
them about how they feel about our Government and give them feedback  as  to
how Parliament works, how the laws are made, the  programmes  of  Parliament
that are being implemented on  the  ground  and  the  rate  of  delivery  of
services. Let me quote the President. However, I will get to that later.

Public hearings are regarded as one way of gathering information.  They  are
a vital contact point with the public. This  is  how  committees  provide  a
forum  for  public  participation.  The  committees  of  Parliament  have  a
constitutional duty to facilitate public  participation  in  the  law-making
process. Our committees are open to the public,  promoting  transparency  in
this institution.

The oversight function of the  committees  is  one  of  the  most  important
aspects of the committees. Oversight by committees is a very important  tool
to  ensure  that  implementation  of  laws  and  policies  and  spending  by
departments and other organs of state  take  place.  It  serves  to  enhance
public confidence in Government and to ensure that Government is  close  and
responsive to the people it governs.

I now want to quote the President in terms of what I have just said:


  We are certain that if our elected representatives, in all the spheres of
  Government, maintain close contact with the people, they will  themselves
  contribute significantly to the achievement of the national objective  of
  accelerating the improvement  of  the  quality  of  life  of  people,  by
  properly  discharging  their  oversight  function  over   the   executive
  authorities in all spheres of Government.

Briefly, the President  was  reminding  us  that  it  is  not  the  duty  of
committees only, in terms of the hearings, but our own duty,  as  individual
members of Parliament, to go down to our  constituencies  and  talk  to  the
people.

Skills development in Parliament has improved tremendously, and  I  am  glad
to  congratulate  both  the  Presiding  Officers  and   the   Secretary   to
Parliament, for an amount of R496 000, which  has  been  allocated  for  the
training of managers and for training in computer literacy.

I now come to research. The Chief Whip also  did  mention  this.  I  am  not
going to spend a lot of time on it. Parliament has  improved  its  tally  of
researchers from eight in the  past  to  the  current  fourteen,  and  eight
contracted researchers in the NCOP, who are being funded by the EU.

Let us come back to the budget. The total allocation is  R469,3 million  for
the year 2002-03, R502,3 million for 2003-04 and R538,1  million  for  2004-
05. Parliament's Budget Vote is projected to increase by 4% in  the  current
financial year and 4% in the medium term. Surely,  hon  members  will  agree
with me that this is not enough.

If we want  to  achieve  a  proper  oversight  function  and  proper  public
participation, and if we want to deal with legislative processes in a  very,
very serious manner, the 4% growth over the MTEF  is  not  enough.  But,  we
need to be involved as  members  of  Parliament  and  assist  the  Presiding
Officers. We as members of Parliament should come out  and  say:  These  are
the things that we should do. The plan that Madam Speaker was talking  about
is quite important and quite essential.

In conclusion, training  and  development  is  recognised  as  an  important
strategic  intervention  in  capacity-building.  With  the  new  performance
management system in place,  training  will  become  key  to  improving  the
operations of Parliament.
The  importance  of  research  has  been  recognised.  The   Department   of
International Development of the British government has  provided  a  three-
year assistance  programme  on  research  to  the  Portfolio  Committees  on
Finance,  Public  Accounts  and  the  Public  Service  and   Administration.
Parliament's own research capacity is being enhanced  with  the  recruitment
of two new researchers, bringing the total number to 16.

The oversight function will, generally, evolve into emphasis on  more  value
for  money.  Substantial  training  is  required  in  the   techniques   and
methodology.

I wish to thank all the Presiding Officers, the Secretary to Parliament  and
the Secretary  to  the  National  Assembly  and  all  their  staff  for  the
wonderful and magnificent job that they have done in the past  year  and  in
the current period. [Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, the challenges which have been  put  by  the
Speaker are noted and we will definitely do something about it.

On behalf of the IFP I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  all  members  of
Parliament and all parliamentary staff and  officials  for  co-operating  so
wonderfully during the past years that  by  now  we  are  proud  to  have  a
Parliament that functions in  accordance  with  international  parliamentary
standards. In particular we want to thank the Speaker  and  other  Presiding
Officers for all their efforts to increase the effectiveness of  Parliament,
its members and its staff.

We, in the IFP, also wish to thank  the  Whips  of  all  other  parties  and
members of all parties for their co-operation. In particular,  we  refer  to
the Chief Whips'  Forum,  which  is  an  excellent  forum  where  we  debate
everything that is important in the life  of  parliamentarians.  This  forum
has in fact become a solution-seeking body and we wish to  place  on  record
that in this forum there is no room for party politics: when we  sit  there,
we do so as members of Parliament and not as members of individual  parties.
In this way, as Whips, we  have  succeeded  in  serving  our  members'  best
interests. The IFP will certainly support the Budget Vote. Our  members  are
appealing that the Speaker,  in  her  budget,  prioritises  the  issuing  of
tickets.

Due to limited time, I would  love  to  devote  time  to  one  of  the  very
important matters, namely the pensions of members of  Parliament.  This  is,
of course, not a party-political matter, but is something that  affects  the
lives of members of Parliament. When a person is elected to become a  member
of Parliament and he or she takes office, there is very little time left  to
pursue any private career. In the circumstances, if a member has  served  in
Parliament for a period  of,  say,  10  years,  that  member,  upon  leaving
Parliament, has very little to go back to. If the member was a  professional
person, his or her practice by then has ceased to exist. The member by  then
is also at least 10 years older and finds it difficult to  find  alternative
employment.

If one looks at the current pension system, a member who is over 60 and  has
served 10 years of  his  or  her  life  as  a  parliamentarian  would  leave
Parliament with a monthly pension, before tax, of around R6 800  per  month.
There is no way a person can exist  on  that  pension  and,  therefore,  the
Chief Whips have thought it  wise  to  investigate  the  whole  question  of
pension properly. Currently, there are some  negotiations  in  this  respect
and it appears that the Whips of all parties are seeking  consensus  on  new
pension schemes for members.

Prospective members of Parliament would certainly be deterred  from  running
for office if they knew that after many years of public life  they  go  back
to private life with a very  meagre  pension.  We  are,  therefore,  looking
forward to a pension system for members of Parliament which  would  just  be
comparable to that in private life and elsewhere in civil society.  One  has
to bear in mind that members of Parliament do not get a 13th  cheque  and  a
housing allowance. People think that members of  Parliament  get  a  pension
and a housing allowance. [Applause.] The  negotiation  around  pensions  for
members is a sensitive one and it is certainly not a  political  issue.  The
IFP supports the proposal that a just and equitable dispensation  should  be
found for retired members of Parliament.

In conclusion, I  take  this  opportunity  to  wish  the  Speaker,  all  the
members, staff and all  persons  who  are  involved  in  Parliament  a  very
prosperous New Year. [Applause.]

Mr L P M NZIMANDE: Mr Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the  Budget  Vote  of
Parliament is another opportunity for members to scrutinise and  subject  to
discussion the resources allocated to this august institution to  enable  it
to fulfil its  mandate  and  the  responsibilities  that  emanate  from  the
Constitution. The highlight of this mandate include, inter alia,  acting  on
the powerful imperative of rapid social  and  economic  transformation;  the
promotion  of  constitutionalism;  human  rights  and  democracy;  and   the
development of policy, as well as the implementation thereof, so  that  they
become  central  to   the   building   of   representative   democracy   and
participation  in  the  process  of  crafting  effective   and   appropriate
resources to end poverty through the national Budget.

Participation  in  this  budget  debate  should  not  be  premised  on   the
perception that allocations are adequate to deal with the enormous tasks  of
this institution.  However,  an  acknowledgement  needs  to  be  made  that,
despite the limitations on the resources allocated, progress is  being  made
in relation to the responsibilities placed upon its members. Therefore,  the
appropriateness of this debate is not only linked to debating  the  adequacy
of the figures allocated  to  it,  but  going  beyond  to  ensure  that  our
processes  of  engagement  as  members  give  value  to  the  mandates   and
responsibilities we are seeking to carry out.

Indeed, we cannot shun away from the fact that Parliament is  underresourced
and, therefore, as has  been  the  debate  among  members  over  the  years,
serious action needs to be taken towards ensuring  that  the  value  of  the
challenges and responsibilities placed upon  members  is  reflected  in  the
manner in which member support is resourced and structured. The  imperatives
of the allocation of resources to Parliament should indeed  take  cognisance
of the priorities and  obligations  of  the  state,  which  include  service
delivery, accessibility for all citizens,  processing  of  legislation  that
speeds up transformation, oversight and accountability.

Therefore, it is imperative for Parliament to breathe life into  its  budget
and develop the infrastructure that will make it an effective and  efficient
institution. It  needs  to  ensure  that  the  responsibility  of  releasing
resources  is  to  its  benefit,  by  placing  its  focus  on   continuously
capacitating and enhancing the ability and potential of members,  if  it  is
to achieve representativity, through the participation  of  the  electorate,
as  a  package  for  political  activity  of  members.  It  needs  to   have
inclusiveness  and  responsiveness  with  ever  increasing  access  to   its
precincts and constituency offices.

If we, as members, take it upon ourselves  to  deal  with  the  problems  of
underresourcing - which make our institution volatile - in response  to  our
needs, and openly deal with the issue  of  inadequate  staff,  for  example,
lack of reasonable administrative and secretarial support  for  meeting  our
information needs; the skills  of  available  staff  and  structure  of  the
administration; and  the  use  of  designated  funds  to  balance  political
processes with decisions taken either as  management  and  politicians,  the
gap between  the  real  needs  and  the  real  resources  available  can  be
balanced.

The budget before us shows a steady increase in the next  years,  which  may
not  be  adequate  to  deal  with  the  challenges  in  total.  However,  it
emphasises the point the ANC is making that the multiplicity  of  the  needs
of Parliament and its members need to be fine-tuned with  the  resources  at
our  disposal.  It  needs  to  ensure  that  infrastructure  development  of
Parliament continues at a speed which does not compromise  the  need  to  be
accessible to all constituencies, particularly those  with  specific  needs,
such as disabled people, the elderly and  the  illiterate,  enhancing  their
ability  to  participate  in  the  promotion  of  representative  democracy.
Services and members' facilities should add value to  their  work,  so  that
they can fulfil their role and responsibility effectively.

This can be done, amongst other things, by ensuring that  there  is  greater
access to training programmes to enhance the capacity  of  committee  clerks
to ensure their efficiency in running the committees.  Researchers  must  be
available  to  members  and  the  library  accessible  to  all  members  for
information. Secretarial assistance, administration and systems that  ensure
the  co-ordination  of  resources,  proper  distribution  of  materials  and
information technology support must be equal to the demand of  members.  All
of these depend upon the commitment we make and the action which follows  in
response to this budget. I cannot argue the need for us, as members of  this
House, to carry the pride of this institution, and raise it to  the  heights
at which it needs to be.

Finally, I am ending my speech by quoting from an address which was made  in
this House by the former President, Nelson Mandela,  when  he  suggested  to
the Assembly and I quote:


  Because the people of South Africa finally chose a profoundly legal  path
  to their revolution, those who frame and enact the Constitution  and  law
  are in the vanguard of the fight for changes. It is in  the  legislatures
  that the instruments have been fashioned to create a better life for all.
  It is here in this House  that  the  oversight  of  Government  has  been
  exercised. It is here that our society, with all its formations, has  had
  an opportunity to influence policy and its implementation.

[Applause.]

Mr C H F GREYLING: Mr Chairperson, unlike my colleague to my  left,  I  will
try not to be controversial. [Interjections.]

As we know, the aim of this Vote is to provide support services required  by
Parliament to fulfil its constitutional functions, assist political  parties
represented in Parliament  to  secure  administrative  support  and  service
constituencies, as well  as  to  provide  members  of  Parliament  with  the
necessary facilities they need to perform their core  functions  effectively
and efficiently.

As gevolg van vermelde oogmerke en doelwitte is die bespreking  van  hierdie
begrotingspos om verskeie redes belangrik. Eerstens, dat  die  funksionering
van die Parlement  tot  'n  groot  mate  die  uitstalvenster  van  ons  jong
demokrasie is. Ons optrede as verteenwoordigers van al die mense  van  Suid-
Afrika behoort dus te alle tye van  so  'n  aard  te  wees  dat  waardigheid
daardeur gekenmerk  word  -  ongeag  ons  partypolitieke  verskille.  Ek  is
bevrees dit is ongelukkig nie die prentjie wat die  publiek  altyd  van  ons
optrede aanskou nie. Ons doelwit moet egter  steeds  wees  om  by  almal  te
probeer   inskerp   dat   hulle    wel    ernstige    en    verantwoordelike
verteenwoordigers in die Parlement  het.  Die  belastingbetalers  van  Suid-
Afrika moet oortuig  wees  dat  hulle  swaarverdiende  belastinggeld  op  'n
kundige  en  deursigtige  wyse  bestee  word.  (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[As a result of the mentioned goals and objectives, the discussion  of  this
Vote  is  important  for  several  reasons.  Firstly,  the  functioning   of
Parliament, to a large extent, is  considered  the  display  window  of  our
young democracy. Our actions as representatives of all the people  of  South
Africa, therefore, should at all times be of such a  nature  that  they  are
characterised by dignity - irrespective of our party-political  differences.
I fear that this is unfortunately not always the impression of  our  actions
that the public witnesses. Our objective should  nevertheless  still  be  to
try to impress upon everyone that  they  do  have  serious  and  responsible
representatives in  Parliament.  The  taxpayers  of  South  Africa  must  be
convinced that their hard-earned tax money is being spent in a  capable  and
transparent manner.]

In this regard, the New NP will play a  positive  role.  However,  it  would
also  be  relevant  to  draw  attention  to  some  of  the  shortcomings  of
Parliament. I would like to mention only a few: committee meetings which  do
not start at the prescribed time; and late notices of meetings, or  meetings
that are cancelled  without  proper  notices  to  inform  members.  In  this
regard, we trust that the new  Chairperson  of  Committees,  the  hon  Geoff
Doidge, will manage the committee system and meetings with a  firm  hand  so
that these kinds of frustrations will not occur in future.

Other shortcomings, in my view, are management problems and  should  not  be
discussed at the Chief Whips' forum. Those are, for instance, the  departure
and the arrival time of buses, untidiness of the parliamentary  terrain  and
offices, ongoing problems with Hansard and access for members to  the  Marks
and Good Hope  buildings.  In  this  regard,  I  would  like  to  thank  the
Secretary to Parliament who, this morning,  assured  us  that  this  problem
will be dealt with effectively from now on.

Sover dit die begroting self aangaan, word dit waardeer dat die  bedrag  vir
lede se fasiliteite en politieke  partye  se  ondersteuningstoelaes  verhoog
is. Spesifiek ten opsigte van kiesafdelingstoelaes, glo ons dat  die  bedrag
per  verteenwoordiger  werklik  drasties  verhoog  behoort  te   word,   met
natuurlik die gepaardgaande ouditkontrole. Die  voortslepende  probleem  met
die opstel van die parlementêre  begroting,  asook  die  nou  reeds  berugte
omsendskrywe L19, behoort so spoedig moontlik opgelos te word.  Dit  is  nie
aanvaarbaar dat net sekere gedeeltes van L19 toegepas word nie  -  soos  dat
Wes-Kaapse lede van die  Parlement  wat  in  Kaapstad  gestasioneer  is,  se
vliegtuigkaartjies verminder word, terwyl die verhoging van  telefoontoelaes
nie tot uitvoer  gebring  word  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[As far as the budget itself  is  concerned,  it  is  appreciated  that  the
amount for members' facilities and  political  parties'  support  allowances
have been increased. Specifically with regard  to  constituency  allowances,
we believe that the amount per representative  really  should  be  increased
drastically - of course, with the concomitant audit controls. The  lingering
problem of the drafting of the parliamentary budget,  as  well  as  the  now
already notorious circular L19, should be resolved as soon as  possible.  It
is not acceptable that only certain parts of L19 are being  applied  -  such
as that Western Cape members of Parliament who are stationed  in  Cape  Town
are have had the number of their airtickets reduced, while the  increase  in
telephone allowances has not been implemented.]

Finally, I want to thank Madam Speaker for the way in which  she  leads  the
House. We also want to thank the Deputy Speaker for the role that she  plays
and the new Chairperson of Committees who has, in the  short  time,  already
shown the ability to be effective. It is also suitable to thank  the  former
Chairperson of Committees, Mr Mahlangu, for the work that he has done.

I would also like to thank the Deputy  Chairperson  of  Committees  for  his
role. Also, we would like to express our appreciation to the new Chief  Whip
and Deputy Chief Whip of the Majority Party for the way  they  have  handled
the Chief Whips' Forum and related meetings. A word of thanks  goes  to  all
the Chief Whips of the other parties for the way in which we  co-operate  in
the Chief Whips' Forum.

Aan die Sekretaris van die  Parlement,  die  Sekretaris  van  die  Nasionale
Vergadering, die Tafelpersoneel en alle ander personeel  van  die  Parlement
wat die wiele aan die rol hou, wil ek ons  waardering  uitspreek  dat  hulle
die funksionering van die Parlement moontlik maak.

Die  Nuwe  NP  steun  hierdie  begrotingspos.  [Applous.]  (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[To the Secretary to Parliament, the Secretary of the NA,  the  Table  staff
and all other staff members of Parliament who keep  the  wheels  turning,  I
would like to express our appreciation for  the  fact  that  they  make  the
functioning of Parliament possible.

The New NP supports this Vote. [Applause.]]

Ms  L  M  T  XINGWANA:  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  this
Parliament and the Presiding Officers for the major  strides  that  we  have
achieved, as women in this House,  since  1994.  First  of  all,  we  won  a
preschool after a long battle in Parliament so that our children could  have
a safe place whilst we are working here. Although it is now closed,  I  hope
that we will not have a huge battle when we need it again.

We have school holidays that coincide with parliamentary recesses.  We  have
a working day that is shorter than when we came here,  in  1994,  to  ensure
that members of Parliament  have  adequate  family  time.  We  also  have  a
presence of women here which is the  envy  of  most  parliaments,  including
those of the western countries and the whole of  Africa.  That  has  ensured
that we have passed legislation, in this Parliament, which has  impacted  on
the lives of ordinary women out there.

I would also like to mention certain pieces  of  legislation  that  we  have
passed in this House in order  to  empower  women.  For  instance,  we  have
passed the Domestic Violence Act, the Maintenance  Act  and  the  Choice  on
Termination of Pregnancy Act, to mention but a few.  We  have  also  ensured
that most of the legislation passed  in  the  House  is  sensitised  to  and
caters for the needs of our women.

Through these pieces of legislation we have  ensured  that  the  issues  and
concerns of women out there are taken up at  the  national  level.  We  have
ensured that each and every department budgets for  the  concerns  of  women
and ensures that they  address  gender  issues.  We  have  put  in  place  a
national machinery which monitors and ensures that these gender  issues  are
catered for, and also ensures that there is a budget that looks after  these
concerns.

There are also outstanding issues. We have outstanding legislation from  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. I  wish  the  Minister
of Justice and Constitutional Development was here so that he could tell  us
where is it that the customary law of succession  is  stuck.  We  have  been
waiting for this law to be tabled for a number of years now.  We  are  going
to make sure that, very soon, that law is tabled in Parliament. We are  also
waiting for the sexual offences Act. We know that rape, abuse  and  violence
against women are escalating all over the country. We  hope  that  this  Act
will be passed soon, in Parliament, in order to tighten  the  rape  laws  in
this country.

We have a number of roles and responsibilities. First of all,  we  have  the
responsibility of oversight,  as  members  of  Parliament,  which  has  been
mentioned. We also have constituencies. Our constituencies go  beyond  party
constituencies. Every woman in South Africa looks to women  parliamentarians
to be their voice in this House, and to raise their concerns and issues.  We
have tried, through the women's caucus, to visit some of the women who  have
faced violence and atrocities, and whose children have been  raped  in  this
country. We have tried to educate women  in  our  constituencies  about  the
laws that affect them which have been passed by  this  Parliament.  However,
we are unable to do all that we want to do.

There are issues that we need to take  to  women,  for  instance,  the  SADC
Declaration on Gender and Development. The women  of  this  country  do  not
know about it. Regarding the Beijing Platform for Action, the women of  this
country have to know what  the  Government  is  doing.  The  women  of  this
country have to be involved so that five years down the line, when we go  to
New York, they will know exactly what had happened. We have a report and  we
know that we have been involved in terms of the programme of  Government  in
that report. We also have the UN Cedaw, of  which  the  majority  of  women,
especially women in the rural areas, are not aware. They are are  not  aware
that our Government is a signatory to that convention.

We therefore need a number of workshops which should  start  with  women  in
the rural areas. Do women at local government levels, our councillors,  know
about these instruments  to  empower  women?  Do  women  in  the  provincial
legislatures know about these instruments  for  empowering  women?  We  know
that our Speakers have set up the women's empowerment unit, which  has  been
running a number of training programmes for women in  the  legislatures.  We
thank them for that project which has empowered our  women  at  that  level.
However, we feel that that is not enough. For us to be able to reach out  to
all the women of South Africa, we need more resources and more workshops.

We also want to raise the question of research and resources. Speakers  have
already mentioned the needs here.  We  meet  with  big  business,  different
structures and sectors,  and  professionals  when  we  deal  with  Bills  in
Parliament.  Unfortunately,  our  researchers  are  limited.  In  terms   of
expertise, they  are  not  any  match  for  the  people  who  come  to  this
Parliament to challenge the Bills  that  we  want  in  order  transform  the
country. Therefore, we need researchers that are well-skilled and  who  know
what they are about. [Applause.]

I would also like to look at the needs  of  women,  in  particular.  We  are
mothers. At the same time, we are leaders in our communities. We are  public
representatives. We have children. We do not really know  what  to  do  with
our children. We do not know whether we should  keep  them  here  in  Acacia
Park because for two weeks one has to go away to one's  constituency,  which
is at home. During most weekends one is away at one's constituency at  home.
Maybe one could leave one's children at home with a relative. But, they  can
be abused. They need the mother and their father. They  need  parental  love
and guidance. We do not have the time for our children.  Therefore,  I  want
to say to Madam Speaker that I support the hon Mbuyazi. Our air tickets  are
not enough. [Applause.]

There are no privileges for the children of parliamentarians.  Our  children
face a lot of stress. The media, when they cannot get at me, will go for  my
child. Some of our children come out in the media and state  that  they  are
HIV-positive. Some of our children are exposed to drugs. They  are  targeted
because we give them a lot of money in order to compensate for  the  neglect
since we are not there as parents. We give them money,  trusting  that  they
will not be hungry when were are not there. They take  that  money  and  buy
drugs and alcohol. Our children, of course, are targeted so that,  tomorrow,
people will say: It is the children of the Minister; it is the  children  of
the members of Parliament that are doing these things and  are  involved  in
crime. The point of the matter is that we are not there. We cannot take  our
children away. They stay in Acacia Park and have parties.  Sometimes  things
that are irresponsible happen. If that happens, tomorrow, in the  newspapers
it will be: It is the children of members of Parliament. [Applause.]

We  have  public  hearings  here  in  Parliament.  That  is  good.  The  ANC
Government said, in 1994,  that  we  should  take  this  Parliament  to  the
people. It also said that we  should  take  this  Parliament  and  bring  it
closer to our people. What happens here is  that  big  business  comes  with
their big lawyers from overseas. De Beers, the Chamber  of  Mines  and  even
companies from overseas come here and bring their lawyers to  stop  us  from
passing the Bills that will transform the economy of this country.

We have nothing. Our mothers cannot come here, whose husbands have  died  in
the mines and whose children have died in  the  mines.  They  get  R200  per
month from De Beers and the Chamber of Mines  to  bring  up  five  children.
[Applause.] They are the ones that cannot come here. We go and apply in  the
committee section. The big bureaucracy there frustrates  us.  Therefore,  at
the end of the day, our  people  cannot  cannot  come  here.  I  think  that
something must be done about that. [Applause.]

I want to talk about training in gender. Yes, we  have  a  lot  of  training
when we open Parliament and so on but we want gender to be  mainstreamed  in
that training.  Every  member  of  Parliament  must  participate  in  gender
training. Every member of Parliament must know  what  our  understanding  of
gender is. We must have a common understanding of gender so  that  we  could
be  able  to  move  forward  together  and  with  a  common   understanding.
[Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, Parliament  looks  forward  to
reports  on  performances  of  government  departments   and   other   state
functionaries. In the same way, it is necessary that Parliament reflects  on
itself, like we are doing this evening.
We should consider ourselves privileged to have  the  calibre  of  Presiding
Officers that we have. The  Speaker,  Deputy  Speaker  and  other  Presiding
Officers preside with dignity and impartiality.  The  Speaker  serves  as  a
real barometer. She knows when the pressure is high and when it is  low  and
is always quick to come forth with interventions when the  need  arises,  as
she did yesterday afternoon. We owe it to the hon Doidge,  the  Chairman  of
Committees, for diligently leading the task team that is  refining  the  new
Rules,  drafted  to  improve  on  the  use  and  control   of   constituency
allowances. We hope that, once  adopted,  parties  will  have  no  headaches
about what to do with public funds.

Whilst some parties, particularly the IFP,  emphasise  their  representation
in the House in resolving issues, the Speaker is  always  at  pains  to  say
even the least of parties has to be heard. It is hoped that all  outstanding
issues, such as the formula for international travel  for  smaller  parties,
will be addressed in the spirit of inclusivity.

We maintain that in the spirit of nation-building,  parties  should  not  be
like Shylock and insist on their pound of flesh. Our appreciation  goes  out
to Parliament for having made it  possible  for  parties  to  have  research
funds from the EU. We just wonder where the next help  will  come  from,  as
the well is about to run dry. We continue to  derive  pleasure  and  maximum
benefit from the research unit of Parliament.

Parliament had it tough last year. Some members ended up  as  casualties  of
problems surrounding the not-yet-concluded question of the arms  deal.  This
is a challenge to all parliamentarians to conduct themselves honourably.  We
hope that, at the right time, the portfolio committee will report on  issues
as recommended by the joint inspection team.

It remains  difficult  to  find  lasting  solutions  to  problems  faced  by
opposition parties in the Marks Building.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking  time
has expired.
Mr I S MFUNDISI: The UCDP supports the Budget Vote.

Mrs P DE LILLE: Chairperson, I am not going to address the ruling  party.  I
also want to address the opposition parties. It is a pity that  the  New  NP
is not here. I want to speak about the role of opposition.

Mr J J DOWRY: I am here.

Mrs P DE LILLE: You are going to disappear in any case, so I am sorry.

The  Constitution  places  obligations  and  responsibilities  not  just  on
Government, but equally on opposition parties to ensure that  our  democracy
succeeds. We cannot afford to adopt the attitude that it is not our  problem
if the Government fails, or it has nothing to do with us if  the  Government
messes up. The fact is that it has everything to do with us. We have a  duty
not to allow the ruling party to mess up  things.  We  have  a  duty  to  do
everything in our power to make our democracy a success, and to live  up  to
the very high standards we have set for  ourselves.  For  our  democracy  to
succeed, South Africa needs both the Government and the opposition.

We have  emerged  after  apartheid  with  a  new  democracy,  and  have  set
ourselves very high standards contained in our Constitution. We  have  vowed
never to go back. One of the most important roles of opposition  parties  is
to ensure that  we  live  up  to  those  standards.  An  important  role  of
opposition parties is to raise issues concerning constitutional  violations,
and we also need a strong, independent media to act as a watchdog.

While the opposition parties' task in  South  Africa  is  to  work  hard  to
change the voting patterns to ensure that people vote on issues rather  than
on party loyalty, the opposition must also  lobby  big  business  and  other
interested  organisations  in  our  country  and  bring   their   views   to
Parliament.

We also need a Government that will consult on national issues.  An  example
is the issue of Nepad. The opposition parties need to be  brought  on  board
and we all need to support this initiative. We need a  Government  that  can
tolerate opposition and criticism,  and  stop  using  the  race  card  as  a
defence, for example, that when one is white, one is a racist and  when  one
is black one is unpatriotic.

Finally, I want to  urge  Madam  Speaker  to  increase  speaking  times  and
resources for small parties. In applying affirmative action,  Madam  Speaker
has to support smaller parties and make them stronger, and reduce the  ANC's
speaking time, because it is mostly praise singing.

We also want to congratulate Comrade Nathi Nhleko  on  his  appointment.  We
will give him all our support. We support this Budget Vote.

Mr J F VAN WYK: Chairperson, the key objectives of the Budget  Vote  are  to
provide support services and facilities to Parliament  and  its  members  to
perform their core functions  effectively  and  efficiently.  In  trying  to
understand  to  what  extent  Parliament's  services   are   meeting   these
objectives, it is important to note that Parliament is an  institution  that
is going through a process of transformation.

Since the first democratic elections in 1994,  the  ANC-led  Government  has
been  faced  with  the  challenge  of  transforming   Parliament   from   an
unrepresentative,  and  largely  executive-dominated  institution,  into   a
centre of dialogue between the people of  South  Africa  and  their  elected
public representatives. Parliament is  a  product  of  the  Constitution,  a
Constitution that  makes  provision  for  the  promotion  of  the  different
cultures and languages of the people of this  country,  and  a  Constitution
with a Bill of Rights that spells out basic human rights on issues  such  as
equality and discrimination, something that has important  implications  for
an institution such as Parliament.

Transformation also  means  that  Parliament  must  develop  into  a  modern
institution  with  facilities  that  meet  the  challenges  of  the  era  of
information technology. Support services and facilities  must  also  reflect
the dignity and status of Parliament as the highest law-making body  in  the
country.
Opening the doors of Parliament means an increase in  public  participation.
Parliament must therefore improve its  capacity  to  accommodate  the  large
numbers of people. This does put a large burden on services such  as  access
control,  security,  household  services,  infrastructural  facilities  like
office space, committee rooms and parking, to name but a few. It means  that
Parliament must develop and introduce language policies and  practices  that
meet constitutional requirements.

Although the  interpretation  services  helps,  the  poor  quality  of  this
service does not help members to  participate  properly.  A  very  important
part of the tools of any politician must be the ability to listen. One  does
not always have to speak to participate, but one must listen  as  well.  But
with this quality of service, one  cannot  do  this.  Parliament  must  also
provide for those who were historically marginalised, such as black  people,
women and the disabled.

The colonial and apartheid parliaments were  male-dominated.  To  this  day,
there are still no proper toilet facilities for women  in  Parliament.  What
progress has been made in addressing  these  challenges?  The  parliamentary
services have taken a range of steps to improve general service delivery  to
Parliament and its members. The  organisational  structure  of  Parliament's
service has been revised to improve strategic planning,  administration  and
financial management. Other steps include improved training  for  staff  and
members, the introduction of a performance management system for  staff  and
the conclusion of performance contracts between managers and staff.

There has been an increase in the expenditure on the network  infrastructure
and computer equipment  for  members.  A  computerised  document  management
system is being installed to improve the flow of work and the management  of
correspondence. A curator and an  assistant  curator  have  been  appointed,
which should contribute to the proper  recording  and  storage  of  our  art
works. We hope that these appointments will also contribute to  the  display
of art works that are more representative of the  diverse  cultures  of  our
country against the walls of Parliament.

Specific attention has been given to  ensuring  the  safety  and  health  of
members,  staff  of  and  visitors  to   Parliament.   This   includes   the
installation of a new  security  system,  the  establishment  of  a  safety,
health and environment  function  and  the  opening  of  the  new  visitors'
centre.

Although these new developments are welcome, there are still some  areas  of
concern. Recently, Parliament experienced problems  with  accommodation  for
meetings and on several occasions was forced to rent outside  accommodation.
Parliament has more than 50 committees. Ad hoc committees that  emerge  from
time to time place a further  burden  on  the  requirement  for  facilities.
Parliament has 25 committee rooms on its premises,  of  which  only  18  are
readily available for bookings in the  committee  section.  Seven  of  these
venues are in 120 Plein Street and are under the control of  the  Department
of Public Works. If one looks at the capacity of  these  offices,  only  two
venues can accommodate more than 150 people; four can seat a maximum  of  65
people; two have capacity for 50 people; and others  accommodate  less  than
30 people. To make the picture worse, the facilities available  in  most  of
these venues are inadequate and outdated. In one report they  were  referred
to as ``pre-war''. I think the report was  referring  to  the  Second  World
War. This situation needs to be rectified.

Negative media reports, continued  complaints  from  members  and  a  recent
report tabled at  the  Joint  Rules  Committee  clearly  indicate  that  the
cleanliness and maintenance of  buildings  in  Parliament  is  not  what  it
should be. The Institutional Support Division of Parliament  is  responsible
for cleaning  and  other  household  services.  The  recent  appointment  of
additional staff to strengthen supervision and other measures has  not  gone
unnoticed, but there is still room for improvement.

The Public Works department is responsible for the  maintenance  of  certain
facilities and part of the  cleaning  of  the  parliamentary  premises.  The
problem  is  that  since  1994  Parliament  has  never  had  a   sustainable
maintenance  programme.  The  PWD  therefore   relies   on   requests   from
Parliament, instead of  having  a  sustainable  maintenance  programme.  The
recent recommendations adopted in the Joint Rules Committee in  this  regard
is a step in the right direction.

Programme 2 of the Budget Vote provides for  members'  facilities,  such  as
telephones,  travel  and  other  logistical  facilities   for   members   of
Parliament.  The  Joint  Subcommittee  on   Members'   Support   now   makes
recommendations to the Joint Rules Committee and the Presiding  Officers  on
these issues. They also advise on members' training needs. The  new  process
resulted in a fundamental revision of the facilities  of  members.  Members'
facilities will consume 27,1% of the total budget  expenditure  in  2002-03.
Expenditure will have increased by 11,2%  over  the  five-year  period  from
1998-99 to 2002-03, with a major increase of 30,9% between 2002-03,  largely
because of the increase in the cost of air travel.

We are thankful for these increases, but if the aim is to provide  resources
that are meant to enable members to function optimally,  this  is  far  from
satisfactory. We want to plead with the  management  of  Parliament  to  get
their act in order if resources are meant to make members more effective  in
their work.

This is not about getting more gravy on the gravy train.  The  idea  of  the
gravy train is actually a myth that some people have planted  in  the  minds
of our people. What is true  is  that  42%  of  members'  income  is  taxed.
Members also contribute to rather than only benefit from taxpayers' money.

There has been a significant increase in expenditure on  computer  equipment
for members, which is welcomed. The truth is  that  members  pay  for  these
computers: the money is deducted  through  monthly  instalments  from  their
salaries. Members also buy their own paper and ink.

I want to make it clear that my plea for more resources to  support  members
is not about getting more money into the pockets of members  of  Parliament.
It is not about comfort or a gravy  train.  Most  bars  in  Parliament  have
closed down, because they are underutilised.  This  is  a  clear  indication
that we do not have the time to relax in bars.  Maybe  the  many  bars  that
were here were the reason why the apartheid government made so  many  stupid
laws. We want to do our job effectively and efficiently, as  stated  in  the
Budget Vote. Members' support facilities need more  resources  in  order  to
serve the people of South Africa  properly  and  realise  the  vision  of  a
people's Parliament.

I want to thank the the Presiding Officers,  the  Secretary  to  Parliament,
his management team and  staff  for  their  efforts.  These  have  not  gone
unnoticed. I agree with Madam Speaker that we have made a smooth  transition
into a democratic Parliament, and the  role  of  management  and  staff  can
never be underestimated.

The ANC suports the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil die  Speaker  bedank  vir  dit
wat sy oor spreektyd gesê het. Ek sê dit reeds vir een en  half  jaar  lank,
maar noudat sy dit gesê het, sal daar moontlik iets gebeur.

Ons het vir 10 minute vanaand na 'n blinde lid geluister.  As  ons  die  tyd
van 'n siende lid tot een minuut beperk,  is  ons,  sy  gehoor,  blind,  dan
verstaan ons nie wat sy standpunt is nie en dan baat hierdie  Parlement  nie
by sy lidmaatskap nie.

Hierdie  begrotingspos  moet  voorsiening  maak  vir  die  uitbou   en   die
instandhou van veelpartydemokrasie in Suid-Afrika. My party, die FA, met  sy
twee lede, word deur  die  ANC  15  minute  toegeken  om  aan  hierdie  drie
maandelange begrotingsdebat deel te neem. Elke FA-lid kry net sewe  en  half
minute om ons menings oor 32 poste te kan lug. Daarteenoor gee die  ANC  vir
die AEB se een lid 46 minute en die MF se  lid  58  minute  om  aan  hierdie
debatte deel te neem.

Die FA is nie die enigste party  teen  wie  hier  gediskrimineer  word  nie.
Selfs die amptelike opposisie, naamlik die DP,  kry  slegs  agt  minute  per
lid; teenoor die PAC en die UCDP se 15 minute per lid. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Nêrens in Afrika, die Statebond of die  Verenigde  Nasies  -  waarvan  Suid-
Afrika lid is - bestaan 'n demokratiese parlement  waar  kritiese  opposisie
op hierdie manier die swye opgelê word en waar mbongi opposisie  op  hierdie
manier beloon word nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mr Chairperson, I would like to  thank  the  Speaker  for
what she said about speaking time. I have been saying this for the past  one
and a half years, but now that  she  has  said  it  perhaps  something  will
happen.

Tonight we listened to a blind  member  for  ten  minutes.  If  we  limit  a
sighted member to one minute then we, his audience, are blind,  then  we  do
not understand what his viewpoint is  and  then  this  Parliament  does  not
benefit by his membership.

This Budget Vote must make provision for the extension  and  maintenance  of
multi-party democracy in South Africa.  My  party,  the  FA,  with  its  two
members, is allocated 15 minutes by the ANC to  participate  in  this  three
month long budget debate.

Every FA member only receives seven and a half minutes to  offer  our  views
about the 32 posts. On the other hand, the ANC gives  the  one  member  from
the AEB 46 minutes and the MF member receives 58 minutes to  participate  in
this debate.

The FA is not the only party who is being discriminated against  here.  Even
the official opposition, namely the DP,  only  receives  eight  minutes  per
member; over and against that, the PAC and the UCDP receive 15  minutes  per
member. [Interjections.]

Nowhere in Africa, the Commonwealth or the United Nations - of  which  South
Africa is a member - does a democratic parliament  exist  where  a  critical
opposition is  silenced  in  this  manner  and  where  mbongi-opposition  is
rewarded in this manner.]
Speaking of  a  transparent  and  democratic  Parliament,  what  are  we  as
politicians  trying  to  achieve  with  the   motions   we   read   out   so
enthusiastically every day? Why do we mislead  the  public  by  making  them
believe that on the next sitting day  we  will  debate  these  motions?  For
about 30 hours per year we propose these one-minute  motions,  knowing  full
well that we will not debate them.  The  governing  party  established  this
parliamentary TV talk show in which parties try to  score  political  points
against their opponents in 60 seconds.

For as long as we restrict some members to one-minute  speeches,  we  cannot
do justice to democracy. Why do we not debate serious  issues  which  affect
the nation, and for what reason  are  the  ruling  parties  not  willing  to
debate their policies in this Chamber? We will destroy  Parliament's  status
if we do not  turn  to  the  rules  that  exist  in  democratic  parliaments
elsewhere in the world. In this  House  every  member  represents  an  equal
number of votes and should have equal status and equal speaking  time,  like
everywhere else in the world.
We must take  stock  of  where  we  are  going  with  this  budget  -  to  a
Westminster or a Moscovite parliamentary system. If I had more time I  would
elaborate on many other evils of Parliament, but I will conclude  by  saying
that the FA has reservations about this budget if the Rules are not  changed
to make Parliament more democratic. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, we welcome the Speaker's  comments  on  the
speaking times for smaller parties. I hope  the  Chair  has  heard  her  and
given me a few minutes more!

We base our system of governance on constitutional  supremacy,  whereby  the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of  1996  governs  as  supreme.
Within this Constitution is vested the establishment and recognition of  the
national sphere of Government and Parliament, which is based, under  section
43(a), in Cape Town and comprise of the National Assembly and  the  National
Council of Provinces, as set out under section 44(a) and (b). It is  further
stated that parliamentary activities must follow procedure  attentively  and
maintain openness and transparency towards the public at all times.

The MF is glad to note the adherence to these constitutional provisions.  We
need to realise that our sincere dedication and commitment to our  appointed
seats  are  more  than  important.  The  nation  is  depending  on  us.  Our
participation and attendance of all  parliamentary  activities  are  vitally
important.

The MF is glad to note the transparency and accessibility of  Parliament  to
the public. We also note the new security system and  we  are  assured  that
although  security  has  been  tightened  the  public  now  has  access   to
Parliament as right and not a privilege.

The funding to uphold Parliament's offices is adequate.  However,  with  the
scare of unhygienic circumstances  a  few  months  ago,  it  is  hoped  that
precautions are being taken to secure a healthy, clean environment in  which
parliamentary activities can be carried out.
As a smaller party, the MF hopes  that  calculations  to  fund  the  support
service would be stepped  up,  noting  the  need  to  ensure  effective  and
efficient  delivery  by  political  parties  in  Parliament.  Minimum  funds
minimise the parties' ability to perform to the best of  their  ability.  It
is hoped that the  budget  allocated  to  Parliament  will  service  smaller
parties a lot more  by  inculcating  a  criterium  of  equity  in  terms  of
proportional party representation.

Before I conclude, I would like to comment that it is evident  that  members
of Parliament make sacrifices by being away from their families and  keeping
two home fires burning. They have to sit and count vouchers to see how  many
are left for one to go home.  They  get  60  singles,  which  amount  to  30
returns and, of course, these include vouchers for one's  spouse,  children,
mother-in-law, father-in-law, etc. The 20% vouchers are for members only.

As for the gravy train, the train may be here but  the  gravy  has  dried  a
long time ago! [Applause.]

I would like at this point to thank the  Presiding  Officers  and  staff  of
Parliament for the close co-operation and working relationship we  have  had
during the past year.

The MF supports the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Mr Chairperson, Madam Speaker, it is  fitting  that  as  we
debate the budget of Parliament we pay tribute to  our  late  colleague  and
comrade, Peter Mokaba, whose  contribution  in  processing  the  Powers  and
Immunities Bill will serve as a  legacy  that  will  define  how  Parliament
functions.

We must also acknowledge the role played by the former Chief Whip,  the  hon
Mapisa-Nqakula, our newly appointed  Chief  Whip,  the  hon  Nhleko  and  my
successor as Deputy Chief Whip, the hon Nel, who  have  steered  this  House
through this hectic session with clear direction,  decisive  leadership  and
efficiency.

Every year at this time ... [Interjections.]
Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: I will get to you, Mr Ellis!

Every year at this time, we assess how far we have come and  whether  we  as
Parliament are rising to the challenges before us. Few would  disagree  with
the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces when she  says,  and  I
quote:


  Our achievements in transforming the legislative landscape  in  the  past
  seven years  are  profound  and  must  be  celebrated  and  acknowledged.
  Sustaining democracy and achieving change in the lives  of  all  citizens
  requires constant monitoring and review of progress.

We have much  to  celebrate.  But  as  responsible  representatives  of  the
people, it is the process of monitoring  and  review  that  must  constantly
seize our attention. And the ANC supports the Speaker's view that we  should
have and should develop a vision  and  strategy  for  Parliament.  By  doing
this, we will in fact afford ourselves  the  opportunity  to  influence  the
budget of Parliament more directly.

Our  committee  process  is  one  of  which  we  are   justly   proud.   The
understanding of the role of committees is  constantly  being  deepened  and
the challenges of having an efficient and effective  committee  system  need
no elaboration. We speak much of our role of oversight.  And  that  valuable
book which I recommend to all members, Building Representative Democracy  by
Christina Murray and Lia Nijzink says that in practice oversight  means  the
review of government actions and decisions. It  also  includes  scrutiny  of
the annual budget.

The size of modern government makes it difficult,  if  not  impossible,  for
legislatures to scrutinise  all  government  action  effectively.  For  this
reason part of the oversight function must  be  to  ensure  that  there  are
adequate alternate mechanisms in place, so that problems are recognised  and
brought to the attention of the legislature in a speedy manner.

The role that Parliament must play in overseeing the actions  of  Government
is one that requires more than simply providing a forum  for  reporting.  As
our Speaker herself has said, we are still developing our understanding  and
trying to  give  effect  to  the  constitutional  relationship  between  the
executive and the legislatures. But what we do know is  that  in  order  for
Parliament to fulfil its constitutional obligations, it needs resources.

The questions that we must constantly ask are, firstly,  whether  Parliament
is adequately resourced in order for it to fulfil  its  constitutional  role
and,  secondly,  whether  we  are  using  and   allocating   our   resources
effectively.

Our foremost resource is human resource. The book that I  have  recommended,
although not referring specifically to this legislature, clearly states:


  Although it is difficult to say what the ideal balance of staff component
  is, the component of staff dedicated to political processes is  sometimes
  small and often committee support is weak.

Whilst we have dedicated members of parliamentary staff working  long  hours
with dedication and under  difficult  conditions,  we  must  recognise  that
Parliament is all too often merely a stepping  stone  on  career  paths.  We
lose valuable talent, often because we do not  develop  the  skills  of  our
human resource component sufficiently so that those who work here  are  able
to execute their duties with confidence and  pride.  Those  of  talent  move
into the civil service where conditions of service are better and there  are
clear career paths.

Do we do sufficiently to nurture our talent? Do we  give  sufficient  status
to members of  our  team,  in  particular  those  who  are  engaged  in  the
legislative processes? These are issues that need to be  looked  at.  As  we
move from a Parliament the primary task  of  which  was  to  develop  a  new
legislative   framework   for   a   democratic   constitutional-rights-based
dispensation,  to  a  Parliament  that  is  charged  with   fulfilling   its
constitutional responsibility of oversight over the actions  of  Government,
we are in a long and laborious process of defining  the  role  of  oversight
and developing the mechanisms, structures and  systems  to  carry  out  that
often intangible task.

The budget process is one  of  the  primary  mechanisms  of  oversight.  But
oversight is not  simply  about  procedures:  it  requires  an  analysis  of
complex information; and it also requires verification and investigation  of
reports and conclusions. The ANC supports the Speaker's view that we  should
not be depending only  on  the  information  that  comes  from  departments.
Whilst we are subjected to a massive number of reports,  we  are  unable  to
verify and analyse them.

One of our greatest challenges is to ensure that the  invaluable  work  done
in  committees  -  the  oversight,  the  reports  and  the  conclusions   of
committees - do not simply gather dust in the archives  of  Parliament,  but
that they are debated in  this  House  and  that  this  House  pays  greater
attention to the wonderful work that is being done  in  the  committees.  We
need to engage far more actively with the work  of  committees.  Looking  at
the recommendations arising out of their  deliberations,  I  am  pleased  to
announce  that  in  the  meeting  of  the  chairperson  committees   several
committees have requested that they be given time to  debate  their  reports
in this House.

As we develop our Parliament and democracy, we must  also  be  ever  mindful
that  we  have  a  parallel  obligation  to  develop  our  relationship  and
communication with those whom we serve  -  that  is,  the  people  of  South
Africa.

The ANC supports this Budget Vote.

Mr Ellis said that last year I was very nasty during this particular  Budget
Vote debate. I want to remind him of what I said. He is an  opposition  that
shouts loudly from the fringes. One need only observe what happened in  this
House yesterday with the hon McIntosh and the hon Lee. I want to say  to  Mr
Ellis that I do not want to ruin the very nice day  we  have  had  with  the
success of Bafana Bafana, so I leave the rest to him. [Applause.]

Mr G H M GIBSON: I am left speechless.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon Ellis is  disappointed,
but ... [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairperson, my Chief Whip says that he is left  speechless
and I have to agree with him.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon McIntosh has  requested
an opportunity  to  make  a  personal  explanation.  I  now  give  him  that
opportunity.

                            PERSONAL EXPLANATION

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Mr Chairperson, I thank you for the opportunity.  I  wish
to explain something to the House and withdraw  some  remarks  that  I  made
yesterday. I do so in the spirit of, and in response to the plea of  Baba  A
Mlangeni, as our senior. He  appealed  with  us  during  the  Sports  debate
yesterday to debate issues seriously and in a dignified way.

I used the words ``they are racist'' in the context  of  ``they''  referring
to remarks and  sentiments  listed  by  the  hon  Donald  Lee,  and  not  to
individuals in the form of the Minister of  Sport  and  Recreation  and  the
President. In the exchange, I  also  denied  using  the  words:  ``They  are
racist'', but said that I used ``it'', not  ``they''  as  referring  to  the
remarks and sentiments as racist. In fact, the words which I used  were:  ``
They are racist.'' I wish to withdraw them, and I regret  that  they  caused
offence.

Further, I wish to make it clear to the House  that  my  use  of  the  words
``bizarre'' and ``quite wrong'' could be construed as a  reflection  on  the
Chair. I wish to assure the Chair and the House of my respect for that  high
office. [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 19:28.
