                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek  gee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem dat -


  (1)  die  DA  na  verwagting  meer  as  R250  000  sal  moet  opdok   aan
       skadevergoeding,  regskoste  en  rente  nadat  'n  stadsraadlid   van
       Bronkhorstspruit 'n lastereis oor 'n smeerveldtog teen die  DA  gewen
       het;


  (2) die eis spruit uit 'n pamflet met lasterlike bewerings oor  me  Caren
       de Jager, ondervoorsitter van die Inwonersforum (Citizens Forum), wat
       die DA voor die munisipale verkiesing versprei het;


  (3) regter Piet van der Walt in sy uitspraak gesê het die  agterkant  van
       die pamflet is ``nie net lasterlik nie, dit is erg lasterlik''; en


  (4) die Nuwe NP hom distansieer van dié soort smeerveldtogte deur die DA.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:
  That the Council notes that -


  (1) it is estimated that the DA will have to cough up more than  R250 000
       in compensation for damages, legal fees and interest after  a  member
       of the Bronkhortstspruit council won a  libel  case  against  the  DA
       after a smear campaign;


  (2)  the  claim  is  the  result  of  a  pamphlet  containing  defamatory
       allegations about Ms  Caren  de  Jager,  deputy  chairperson  of  the
       Citizens  Forum,  distributed  by  the  DA  prior  to  the  municipal
       elections;


  (3) Judge Piet van der Walt said in his judgment that the reverse side of
       the pamphlet ``is not only defamatory, but very defamatory"; and


  (4) the New NP distances itself from this type of smear campaign  by  the
       DA.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I give  notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes yesterday's election victory and the  landslide  swing  to  the
       Christian Democrats in the Netherlands where  they  on  15  May  2002
       achieved a decisive victory over the ruling Labour  Party  Coalition,
       winning 40 of 150 seats of the parliament of the Netherlands;


  (2) notes that this signifies,  inter  alia,  that  many  voters  in  the
       Netherlands are fed up with the excessive secular humanist agenda  of
       the left and wish to see a return to family and  traditional  values;
       and


  (3) congratulates the Christian Democrats and wishes  the  new  coalition
       government to be formed in the Netherlands well.

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek  by  die  volgende  sitting
sal voorstel:
  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat president Mbeki amnestie verleen het aan gewelddadige
       misdadigers aan wie die WVK nie amnestie verleen het nie;


  (2) die vraag opper of daar nou 'n ``agterdeur''-blanko algemene amnestie
       gaan wees; en


  (3) president Mbeki versoek om duidelikheid in dié verband te verskaf  en
       die vraag te beantwoord hoe 'n algemene amnestie kan voldoen aan  die
       beginsel van gelykheid voor die reg aangesien amnestie deur  die  WVK
       verleen aan streng maatstawwe moes voldoen.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that President Mbeki granted amnesty to  violent  criminals  to
       whom the TRC did not grant amnesty;


  (2) raises the question whether there will now be a ``back door'' blanket
       general amnesty; and


  (3) requests President Mbeki to give clarity in this regard and to answer
       the question how a general amnesty can meet the principle of equality
       before the law, as amnesty granted by the TRC had to  meet  stringent
       criteria.]

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by die volgende sitting  van
die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem van die krimpende steun wat die DA in  die  Wes-
  Kaap geniet, met spesifieke verwysing na die tussenverkiesing op  15  Mei
  in Hermanus Overstrand waar sy steun:


     (1)    in Wyk 2 met 70,9% van 1 832 stemme in 2000 tot 533  op  15  Mei
         verminder het; en

[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day I shall move:


  That the Council takes note of the diminishing support the DA  enjoys  in
  the Western Cape, with specific reference to the 15  May  by-election  in
  Hermanus Overstrand where its support -


  (1) decreased by 70,9% in Ward 2 from 1 832 votes in 2000 to 533 votes on
       15 May; and]

[Interjections.]]

  (2) in Wyk 4 met 45,4% van 1 384  stemme  in  2000  tot  756  op  15  Mei
       verminder het.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)


  [(2)     decreased by 45,4% in Ward 4 from 1 384 votes  in  2000  to  756
       votes on 15 May.]]

Me E C GOUWS: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by die volgende  sitting  van
die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die  feit  dat  gesondheidsdienste  in  die  Oos-Kaap
       sistematies besig is om in duie te stort, soos blyk uit -


       (a)  die herhaaldelike versuim om fondse aan  hospitale  en  klinieke
           oor te betaal, waardeur die personeel in  'n  onbenydenswaardige
           posisie geplaas en pasiënte in lewensgevaar gelaat word;


       (b)  die onderbesteding van verlede jaar se  begroting  vir  MIV/Vigs
           asook die versuim om vir dié doel gereeld fondse in die rekening
           van die Universiteit van Fort Hare oor te betaal;


       (c)  die versuim om vakante poste vir gesondheidswerkers te vul; en


       (d)  die onvermoë om gesondheidswerkers opnuut op te lei en  vir  die
           diens in die provinsie te behou; en


  (2) 'n beroep doen op die nasionale Minister van Gesondheid om  onverwyld
       in te gryp in die Oos-Kaap waar menselewens op die spel is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes  the  fact  that  health  services  in  the  Eastern  Cape  are
       collapsing systematically, as is evident from -


       (a)  the repeated failure to transfer funds to hospitals and clinics,
           thereby placing staff in  an  unenviable  position  and  leaving
           patients in danger of their lives;


       (b)  the underspending on last year's budget for HIV/Aids as well  as
           the failure regularly to transfer funds in this  regard  to  the
           account of Fort Hare University;


       (c)  the failure to fill vacant posts for health workers; and


       (d)  the inability to retrain health workers and retain them for  the
           service in the province; and


  (2) appeals to the national  Minister  of  Health  to  intervene  in  the
       Eastern Cape at once, because people's lives are at stake there.]

                  KILLING OF DIEPKLOOF POLICE COMMISSIONER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness and shock the killing of the Commissioner  of  the
       Diepkloof Police Station, Senior Superintendent Elias  Mashau,  by  a
       prisoner on Saturday, 11 May 2002;


  (2) strongly condemns this mindless attack on a police officer;


  (3)  expresses  condolences  to  his  family,  his  colleagues  and   the
       communities which are affected by his death; and
  (4) calls on the authorities to launch a thorough investigation into  the
       incident so as to bring the perpetrators to book.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             THEFT AT GOLD MINES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the scale of gold theft which was highlighted last
       week when police seized more than half a ton of gold  dust  during  a
       raid on a mineworkers' hostel in Thabong, Welkom, in the Free State;


  (2) further notes that thieves steal about 35 tons  of  pure  gold  at  a
       value of nearly R2 billion from South African mines every year;
  (3) also notes that a study by the Institute for Security Studies in Cape
       Town has highlighted that the total working profit for South Africa's
       gold mines in 1998 would  have  been  33,3%  higher  had  there  been
       watertight security;


  (4) believes that international crime syndicates should be dealt with  in
       co-operation with other international agencies; and


  (5) therefore resolves that the only way to root out this  crime  is  for
       governments across the world to attack the illegal gold market itself
       rather than to depend on the police to catch the criminals  at  lower
       levels of these syndicates.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   INCREASED DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL BETWEEN JOHANNESBURG AND RICHARD'S BAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) applauds the South African Airways for rendering a very good  service
       to the community;


  (2) notes  that  owing  to  the  fast-growing  industries  in  Empangeni,
       Richard's  Bay  and  the  surrounding   areas,   Flight   1607   from
       Johannesburg to Richard's Bay is always full;


  (3) further notes that frequent flyers are facing the  problem  of  being
       left behind now and again;


  (4) also notes that according to SAA the  runway  at  the  Richard's  Bay
       Airport is too small to accommodate bigger aircraft; and


  (5) therefore requests SAA,  as  a  priority  measure,  to  address  this
       problem encountered by  members  who  fly  frequently  to  serve  the
       communities in this area.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      ANC VICTORY IN HANTAM BY-ELECTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G A LUCAS: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes  the  overwhelming  victory  for  the  ANC  registered  in  the
       municipal by-election yesterday in the Hantam Municipality,  formerly
       known as Calvinia;


  (2) further notes the dismal performance of the DA  in  this  by-election
       ...
[Interjections.]


       ... which clearly demonstrates the outright rejection of  this  party
       by the people of the Northern Cape; and


  (3) also notes that the confidence our  people  have  in  the  ANC  is  a
       reflection of the correctness of our policies.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the motion? The motion is objected to.  In  the  light  of  the
objection, the motion may not be  proceeded  with  and  the  motion  without
notice will now become notice of a motion.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 17 - Housing:

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome the hon the Minister of Housing,  and  in  particular
also to welcome the various MECs and special delegates. I call upon the  hon
the Minister to address the House. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Chairperson, hon MECs from the  provinces,  special
delegates and members, the housing policy  has  evolved  from  a  crude  and
ready instrument to tackle the impending catastrophe of homelessness into  a
comprehensive  instrument  that  forges  meaningful   partnerships   between
communities and Government. We still have a long way to go  in  meeting  the
task of wiping  out  the  housing  backlog  and  creating  meaningful  human
settlements, but we believe  that  this  year's  budget  has  shifted  gears
towards the quality of programme we believe our people expect.

Housing subsidies are one of Government's main instruments  to  address  the
legacy of poverty and inequality. The  national  housing  subsidy  programme
has proved to be very effective  in  serving  as  an  instrument  of  social
upliftment.  On  the  other  hand,  it  has  become  a  demand-side   market
intervention to increase effective demand for housing goods and services.

The subsidy has provided an  equity  base  against  which  to  gear  private
resources in the form of sweat equity, savings and loans. There is no  doubt
that the aims of providing subsidy assistance  have,  within  the  available
resources,  largely  been  met.  The  national  housing  subsidy  programme,
introduced in 1994 on a project-linked subsidy basis only, has evolved  into
a comprehensive instrument providing a wide array of housing subsidies to  a
broad spectrum of eligible beneficiaries.

The programme has allowed for a range of tenure options on an individual  or
group basis in urban areas, and was later enhanced to  include  families  in
rural areas who have functional security of tenure in terms of  the  Interim
Protection of Informal Land Rights Act of 1996. Highlights  of  the  subsidy
programme, as at the end of the financial year 2001-2002, include,  firstly,
the approval of more than 1,4 million housing  subsidies,  the  construction
of more than 1,35 million houses and the  Government's  investment  of  more
than R18 billion since 1994.

Our change of focus from quantity to quality has managed to  produce  better
housing in many provinces, especially through the people's housing  process.
We have always thought that this change in delivery  strategy  could  affect
the pace of delivery in some provinces, but  it  has  not.  We  have  indeed
proved our capability to deliver adequate shelter to the poor. Our  delivery
rate of 322 000 dwelling units per annum, which was  achieved  during  1997,
could have been sustained or even accelerated if  physical  constraints  did
not limit the housing budget to around R3 billion per annum.

The increase in the budget this year and in the  next  two  financial  years
should help us improve on the quality of houses.  Owing  to  the  manner  in
which state functions are currently structured, funds that  support  housing
development  are  not  channelled  through  a   single   window,   but   are
appropriated under several Votes. For instance, financial  support  to  poor
communities is provided  under  the  Consolidated  Municipal  Infrastructure
Programme under the Department of Local Government Vote, whereas  the  water
and sanitation programme of the Department of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry
finances the capital cost of services for which provision is  also  included
under the National Housing Subsidy Programme.

I would be failing in my duties if I did not also  indicate  the  challenges
we face. A number of our policy instruments are still  relatively  new,  and
their full positive impact is still to be felt at grass-roots  levels.  This
is especially the case in rural areas where development has  sometimes  been
retarded on account of tenure uncertainty  and  capacity  constraints.  Then
there is the problem of the slow transfer of land  and  delays  in  township
establishment procedures, sometimes owing to capacity constraints  at  local
government level. The re-emergence of the problem of underspending  in  some
of the provinces indicates capacity difficulties  at  provincial  and  local
government levels.

Four provinces experienced  unacceptable  underspending  levels  during  the
past year. These provinces are the Eastern Cape,  the  Free  State,  Gauteng
and Mpumalanga. However, amounts  of  R80  million  for  Gauteng  and  R58,9
million for Mpumalanga can be attributed to  the  funds  earmarked  for  the
Jobs Summit project, whose negotiations at national  level  between  Housing
and Treasury were completed only towards the end  of  December  2001.  These
funds are expected to flow during the early parts of the  current  financial
year.

Key reasons for the underspending in the provinces can be given  as  follows
in the Eastern Cape the province received R508  million,  and  spent  R293,2
million, underspending by 42,3%. The initiative to  utilise  SMMEs  for  the
construction of houses worth about R80 million on 23 787 sites, serviced  in
the financial year  2001-02,  has  not  materialised  because  of  the  slow
process  of  transferring  the  serviced  sites  into  the  names   of   the
beneficiaries.
The late  approval  of  rapid  land-release  projects  and  adverse  weather
conditions also affected the timeous payment of approximately R100 million.

The Free State received R251,8 million and spent R146,3 million. That  means
underspending is at R105,5 million or 41,9%. There are a number  of  reasons
for this, such as the difficulty in obtaining title deed numbers to  process
progress payments four and five. A factor contributing  to  underexpenditure
is delays at the Deeds Office in registration of title deeds.  The  national
Department of Housing is in a process  with  other  government  departments,
such as Land Affairs, to improve interdepartmental communication in  respect
of matters  of  this  nature  which  might  have  an  influence  on  matters
inhibiting the execution of housing programmes.

Gauteng received R797,9 million and spent R576,2 million,  which  left  them
with  an  underexpenditure  of  R191,7  million.  The  underexpenditure   is
equivalent to 25%, the bulk of  which  was  money  allocated  for  the  Jobs
Summit  projects  which  have  been  slightly   delayed   because   of   the
negotiations between the Department of Housing and the Treasury.

Other  reasons  include  the  following.  A  number  of  new  projects  only
commenced during the  2001-02  financial  year  and  it  was  foreseen  that
expenditure thereon would materialise late in the financial  year.  Most  of
the newly established local authorities are experiencing  capacity  problems
in managing housing projects as a result  of  restructuring  processes.  The
requirements of the National Environmental  Management  Act  delay  all  new
projects by at least three months.

Mpumalanga has 19,1% underexpenditure,  the  bulk  of  which  is  the  money
allocated for the  Jobs  Summit  projects  which  have  also  been  slightly
delayed. The rest of the provinces manage to  spend  all  their  allocations
with  some  of  them  even  exceeding  their  budgets.  KwaZulu-Natal   only
underspent by 4,8%.

When  it  comes  to  human  settlement  redevelopment  grant   spending   by
provinces, the  late  approval  of  business  plans  of  projects  prevented
provinces from  commencing  with  the  implementation  as  anticipated  and,
consequently, provinces were prevented from starting the  implementation  of
the projects as anticipated in the business plans.

In view of the aforementioned, it is anticipated  that  capital  expenditure
will improve as from  April  this  year.  The  expenditure  pattern  of  the
provinces will be monitored closely and, if necessary, the  same  approaches
followed with the housing fund grant will have to be followed in respect  of
human settlement grants.

Conveyancers do not diligently ensure that transfers take place as  planned.
The subsidy implementation  guidelines  prescribe  that  top  structures  be
constructed  on  sites  which  have  been  registered  and  transferred   to
beneficiaries. The prescribed payments are consequently  delayed.  A  number
of provinces experience problems with  conveyancers  who  are  not  diligent
enough in processing transfers of ownership to beneficiaries.

Too often, the conduct of those in the conveyancing profession  has  been  a
major stumbling block in the housing delivery  process.  Also,  there  is  a
total lack  of  capacity  in  some  of  these  professionals  to  deal  with
intricate conveyancing processes within appropriate  legal  frameworks,  for
example applications approved in terms of the Development Facilitation  Act,
Act No 67 of 1995.

Provinces with such problems  should  establish  a  provincial  database  of
conveyancers with the demonstrated ability  to  deliver  within  the  strict
timeframes  described.  All  applicants  will   be   required   to   utilise
professionals listed on the database. Provincial housing departments  should
empower municipalities with regard  to  managing  their  relationships  with
conveyancers.

An amendment to the Act to alleviate this problem should be fast-tracked  as
a matter of urgency. This matter is being discussed  by  the  Department  of
Housing, the Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  and  Salga.
Approval of applications for deviations  from  policy  for  deserving  cases
affected by problems has been made for the  Eastern  Cape  and  approved  by
Cabinet.

While there have been genuine constraints during  implementation  processes,
it should also  be  acknowledged  that,  in  most  instances,  underspending
happens because of poor performance by developers. There could be  a  number
of reasons for this, namely poor management of  community  dynamic;  labour-
related  problems;  and  poor  planning  and  management  of  projects   and
availability and accessibility of bulk infrastructure.

One of the legal technical issues detrimentally affecting the  process  flow
in the housing delivery cycle  is  section  118  of  the  Local  Government:
Municipal Systems  Act.  It  relates  to  the  issuing  of  rates  clearance
certificates in terms of the Act by municipalities in  order  to  allow  for
transfer of ownership to  be  registered  by  the  Registrar  of  Deeds.  If
transfer of property cannot take place, progress payments four and five  are
delayed. Not only the  phrasing  of  the  relevant  section,  but  also  the
interpretation and implementation thereof have had serious delaying  effects
on housing delivery.

The Act requires that all outstanding  payments  due  to  municipalities  be
paid up before the clearance certificate  is  issued  for  the  transfer  of
property.  Most  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  housing   subsidy   grant,
especially  the  in  situ  upgrading,  have   outstanding   rates   due   to
municipalities. The  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  has
undertaken to amend this legislation during this current year.

Some of the requirements of the National Environmental Management  Act  have
also  affected  the  speed  of  delivery  in  housing   projects.   Approval
procedures  for  environmental  impact  assessments  have  been  very  slow.
Gauteng is one of the provinces greatly affected by this legislation. It  is
a matter that needs to be speedily addressed among  the  provinces  and  the
relevant departments.

A number of provinces have experienced  persistent  heavy  rainfalls,  which
originally were not factored into the planning process. While this led to  a
high demand for emergency shelter, it, however, also had a  negative  impact
on housing delivery. Closer co-operation between the  provincial  and  local
spheres of government is also critical  in  order  to  achieve  a  realistic
housing delivery process. Formalised interaction should occur on  a  regular
basis between municipal housing delivery  components  and  their  provincial
counterparts.

At provincial level, political oversight of the  delivery  processes  should
be strengthened.  The  integrated  development  plan,  co-ordinated  by  the
Department of Provincial and Local Government, should also focus on  housing
needs. Integrated Development Plans will go  a  long  way  towards  ensuring
that housing delivery happens within integrated planning processes.

Problems with bulk infrastructure and community issues  are  better  planned
for within integrated planning  processes.  Improved  co-ordination  between
Salga, the Departments of Provincial and Local Government, Land Affairs  and
Housing should be encouraged with respect to  development  of  policies  and
legislation working against  their  delivery.  An  example  is  section  118
mentioned above.

The national office intends visiting underperforming provinces twice  yearly
for close monitoring of expenditure. The main focus of  the  2002  and  2003
provincial capacity-building programmes is to ensure that they  are  aligned
to both provincial and  national  housing  priorities.  Training  should  be
focused on both strategic and operational interventions to  meet  the  needs
at each level. The main  emphasis  of  the  intervention  is  at  the  local
government level.

Each province has been  allocated  an  amount  of  R1,1  million,  with  the
exception of the Northern Cape, which has been allocated an amount  of  R1,2
million. The total amount allocated to all provinces for  housing  capacity-
building in  2002-03  is,  therefore,  R10  million.  This  money  has  been
allocated directly by national Treasury to the respective provinces.

The national Department of  Housing,  in  conjunction  with  all  provinces,
conducted the following activities. Firstly,  in  July  2001,  research  was
conducted to determine provincial capacity-building gaps. This was  followed
with workshops with  all  provincial  housing  departments  to  discuss  the
outcomes of the research.

Secondly, there is a need for an  ongoing  impact  assessment  of  capacity-
building  interventions  to  establish  their  effect  on  the  delivery  of
housing. It needs to  be  mentioned  in  this  regard  that  the  department
developed guidelines for provinces in respect of impact evaluation  and  all
provinces have included impact evaluations in their plans.

Thirdly, most of the issues raised above will be addressed in  a  medium  to
long-term plan. The department  is  at  present  finalising  a  strategy  on
housing capacity-building that  will  deal  with  the  medium  to  long-term
issues. This report will only  focus  on  the  programmes  that  are  to  be
implemented in the financial year 2002-03.

From a policy perspective, criticism indicates that too  much  emphasis  was
initially placed on ownership. This is understandable  when  viewed  against
the  background  of  past  deprivation  of  property  rights  affecting  the
majority of the population. However, a more balanced approach was  required,
hence recent initiatives to normalise the rental housing market and  promote
alternative tenure options.

The lack of a comprehensive rental housing policy has been recognised  as  a
shortcoming and a process has  been  initiated  to  fulfil  this  need.  The
Rental Housing Act  of  1999  has  been  adopted,  and  the  Social  Housing
Foundation has been statutorily  recognised  and  mandated  to  promote  the
concept of co-operative housing  and  to  assist  in  the  establishment  of
institutions to hold and manage housing stock on a sustainable basis.

The  national  Presidential  Jobs  Summit  will  inform   the   process   of
establishing rental housing policy.  Various  options  of  providing  rental
housing, based on a holistic, viable and sustainable process  of  integrated
community development, will be tested.  The  department  has  finalised  the
drafting of social housing policy, which will constitute  a  great  part  of
our drive in promoting rental housing.

The hostel redevelopment programme will  also  become  a  second  thrust  in
promoting rental housing.  The  problem  focuses  on  providing  choice  and
encouraging  the  development  of  family   units   for   affordable   rent.
Transformation and redevelopment of hostels is key  to  the  restoration  of
dignity to this  sector  of  our  society,  the  hostel  dwellers.  This  is
intended to reverse the worst kind of discrimination which  forced  many  of
our people to live in overcrowded single-sex hostels, denied  the  right  to
live with their families.

To add insult to injury, these hostels had the minimum of or  no  facilities
and were isolated from surrounding communities.  We  need  only  recall  the
bloodshed in the early nineties to know that never again should  our  people
be expected to live under such conditions, robbed  of  the  very  basics  of
their dignity.
A draft social housing Bill was developed last year. This Bill is  currently
being refined in line with the social  housing  policy  discussion  document
that has been developed. It aims to establish a sustainable  social  housing
process, provide for the establishment of the Office  of  the  Registrar  of
Social  Housing  Institutions,  and  it  affords  statutory  recognition  to
housing institutions.

This office will establish accreditation processes and criteria for  housing
institutions and generally regulate, inspect and do all things necessary  to
ensure good governance and sustainability of housing institutions.

Following the finalisation of the special integrated  presidential  projects
and urban renewal projects programme, a need was identified for a  programme
to  assist  municipalities  to  initiate  human   settlement   redevelopment
projects, which will focus on correcting imbalances  and  dysfunctionalities
of our human settlement patterns.

In the overall quest for more efficient and  productive  human  settlements,
and to move away from the apartheid structures of the past, the aim  of  the
programme is to improve the quality of the urban environment  by  addressing
the legacy of  dysfunctionality  in  human  settlement  by:  addressing  the
nature and underlying reasons for dysfunctionality; providing  a  source  of
funding to correct such dysfunctionality and acting as catalysts to gear  up
other resources; co-ordinating sources of  development  funding  to  promote
holistic, integrated development; and adding value to projects which can  be
funded through other processes and programmes.

The following broad categories of projects are  thus  considered  under  the
programme: infrastructure upgrading initiatives to facilitate  redevelopment
of  depressed  areas  or  to  improve  access  to  employment  and  business
opportunities; land intervention initiatives to counter  spatial  distortion
and  enhance  the  integration  of   human   settlements;   replanning   and
redevelopment  of  existing  human  settlements  which  could  entail   slum
clearance, acquisition of property, planning  of  redevelopment  initiatives
and  resettlement  of  people;  consolidation  initiatives  where   previous
housing or development initiatives  resulted  in  unsafe,  inappropriate  or
substandard developments that are in need of enhancement; the  provision  of
essential community  facilities  and  amenities;  and,  special  development
needs projects to satisfy  presidential  requests  that  may  entail  cross-
functional  co-operation  and  co-ordination   and   require   extraordinary
solutions outside of approved Government programmes.

The Human Settlement  Redevelopment  Programme  impacts  positively  on  the
lives of  people  and  communities  in  a  physical,  social,  economic  and
environmental context. The programme is judged to fill a major  gap  in  the
development needs of dysfunctional, disadvantaged communities  which  cannot
be addressed through existing alternative Government programmes, and  it  is
envisaged that this will be increasing.

In conclusion, I have worked today to give hon members a  clear  picture  of
where we are in housing. Some parts of that picture is not as bright  as  we
would all like it to be, but there is no reason for despair. As  I  said  in
the National Assembly two days ago, housing is not only on  track  in  South
Africa, it is meeting the needs of more and more people  all  the  time.  We
are facing and dealing with the challenges. We are  providing  more  choices
than ever before, and we are committed to better quality.

As hon members may know, we have raised the subsidy from 27% to the  current
57%, that is from 1997 to date. The subsidy has increased from 27%  to  57%.
This is progress we can all be proud of. I call  upon  hon  members  in  the
provinces to take this progress forward and to make sure that the  interests
of our people become our main priority. [Applause.]

uMphathiswa wezeZindlu umama uSankie Mthembi-Mahanyele,  izikhulu  eziphethe
amaSebe ezeZindlu  kumaphondo,  mandigqithise  umbulelo  ongazenzisiyo  weli
Bhunga laMaphondo leSizwe ngokuthabatha kwazo inxaxheba kolu hlahlo lwabiwo-
mali lwezeZindlu.

Mandigqithise umbuliso wam ekhaya eZulwini apho  izono  zam  ziya  kuxolelwa
khona ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  [Uwele-wele.]  Kwakhona  ndigqithise  umbulelo  nombuliso  wam
kongasekhoyo  okaThangane,  uTshonyane,  uAktham.  (Translation   of   Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, Minister of Housing, Mrs  Sankie  Mthembi-
Mahanyele,  and  respectable  people  who  govern  the  provincial   housing
departments, allow me to convey my sincere gratitude to  the  NCOP  for  the
opportunity to take part in this debate on the Housing Budget Vote.

Allow me to convey greetings to my home, Heaven, because that  is  where  my
sins will be forgiven  ...  [Applause.]  I  also  convey  greetings  to  the
deceased Thangane, Tshonyane, Aktham.]

Currently, there are several problems  with  regard  to  the  provision  and
handing over of houses to poor people at local level. In many  instances  in
which houses built by the national Department of Housing have to  be  handed
over to the poor people, there are conflicts with regard to  nonpayment  for
municipal services. These conflicts often lead to  owners  losing  ownership
of houses as a result of nonpayment.

Regarding the need for integrated and intergovernmental  co-ordination,  the
current provision of housing often lacks  co-ordination  between  government
departments. The national Department of  Housing  sets  the  standards  that
provincial governments and local governments have to implement.

In the provision of housing, the minimum standards are  often  not  followed
by the builders, owing to a lack of co-ordination between the  national  and
provincial housing departments. Poor-quality houses are built  and  builders
are not held accountable for poor services. The Department of Housing  lacks
land on which to build  houses,  but  the  Department  of  Public  Works  is
disposing of land. Surely that is not acceptable?

The present situation in the  provision  of  houses  shows  that  integrated
development planning  is  not  taken  into  account.  A  number  of  housing
projects are discarded, lack planning and ignore the needs  of  the  people.
What is the department doing in terms of policy to change the situation  and
ensure that housing is provided in a  manner  that  is  in  compliance  with
integrated development?

Mandingene apha esiNtwini. Ukuze  umntu  abenesidima,  isithozela,  kufuneka
azive ekhuselekile ngokuthi aphume endlwini, ekhayeni  elifudumeleyo.  Owona
ndoqo womkhombandlela  kweli  sebe  lakhe,  umama  uMphathiswa,  kukuncedisa
kwiphulo lokunciphisa ubuhlwempu nokuphucula  ubomi  babantu  abangena  nto,
iimpula zikalujaca.

Mandithi huntshu! kweli  sebe  ngoba  indima  yalo  iyabonakala,  icace  gca
okomva webhokhwe isenyuka  eqhineni.  Okanye  unokuthi  icace  gca  okwekati
esehlungwini.  Abantu   bakuthi   namhlanje   bayazingca   kuba   banezindlu
ezikhuselekileyo, ngakumbi amakhosikazi.

Simbonile, uMphathiswa, engena kwisithili nakwizithilana ebezingaziwa  mntu.
Maxa  wambi  engena  ngobambiswano  noorhulumente  bamanye  amazwe.  Izindlu
azakhileyo kumzana  omncinane  waseLady  Grey  zingummangaliso.  Ubani  uthi
akufika kuzo kushushu afike zipholile ngaphakathi, athi akuya  kuzo  kubanda
afike zifudumele ngenxa yomtha welanga.

Kuthabatha iintsuku  zibe  sixhenxe  ukuze  umbundlwana  uthungulule  ubone.
Kambe kukho abantu abathathabatha iminyaka esibhozo  besithi  ababoni  ukuba
lo Rhulumente wenza ntoni. Akanakuze abone ongekaboni ngeli xesha.

Mna ndimele  abantu  abangenanto,  abantu  basezilalini,  abantu  abazidlayo
ngobuntu babo. Ndiya kuba andibamelanga ngokwaneleyo  nangokugqibeleleyo  xa
ndingathethanga  ngeemfuno  zabo.  Uphuhliso  lwesebe  lakhe,   uMphathiswa,
luthule  luthe  tu,  wena  wakhe  wabona  umfi  ebhokisini,   xa   kuthethwa
ngobonelelo ngezindlu ezilalini. Ewe, thina  siqhele  ukuzakhela  ezilalini,
kodwa ngenxa yentlupheko ekhoyo  ngoku  elizweni,  abantu  abawakhileyo  loo
maqhenge abakwazi ukuwafulela.  Lithini  isebe  lakhe  ukuncedisana  nabantu
abasezilalini?

Thina  ezilalini,  ngesi  sibonelelo,  singakha  ipomakazi,  hayi  le  nqala
yakhiwa kwezi dolophu. Makasinike imali, uMphathiswa,  uyakubona  ezilalini.
Ndihlaba  ikhwelo  elithi,  abantu  basemakhaya   mabaxhamle   nabo   kubomi
obungcono. Ukuba kufuneka kundululwe uMthetho oYilwayo, nto  leyo  engumqobo
onqanda ukuba abantu  bangabinakho  ukuba  yinxalenye  yolu  xhamlo,  siyile
komiti sizimisele ukuza  nawo  ngokukhulu  ukukhawuleza.  Asithunywa  thina,
singayi. Usana olungakhaliyo ke lufela embelekweni.

Ayinyamezeleki into yokubona indlela amaqumrhwana  ezimali  abacalula  ngayo
abantu  bakuthi.  Masilamkele  ngezandla  ezishushu  iphulo   likaMphathiswa
lokuncedisana nabantu ngokuthi bazenzele  amaqumrhwana  okulondoloza  imali,
ukuze benze  igalelo  ekwakhiweni  kwezindlu.  Eli  liphulo  elibalulekileyo
likaVukuzenzele.

Kumbandela wezindlu zesibonelelo, mandenze  ikhwelo  kumaphondo  onke  ukuba
alungise   iziphene   zangaphambili,   apho   izindlu   zabantu   abantsundu
zasisakhiwa kude lee nedolophu. Ndibabona abaphathiswa belandela  kanye  loo
mgaqo  ngeli  xesha.  Masiqiniseke  kwinto   yokuba   sidibanisa   imihlambi
eyayisakwalana ngokuthi sizakhe izindlu  apho  zifuneka  khona,  apho  kukho
iinkonzo nalapho kukho iindlela nemisebenzi.

Imithetho yokwenza ngcono impilo yabantu esiyipasisileyo, kule  Ndlu,  mihle
kakhulu kodwa iphelela ephepheni, ayigunyaziswa.  Lowo  ke  ngumngeni  kuthi
sonke ngalo mzuzu kulo nyaka wobuvolontiya. Thina  bale  komiti  siza  kuthi
gqolo ukuqinisekisa ukuba iyenziwa into ngabo abasemagunyeni.  Siza  kubathi
chu, wena wakhe wabona  inkomo  ityiwa  sisibawu.  Abayijongela  phantsi  le
mithetho siyenzile kanzima kangaka, baza kuthi bevuka beve ngathi  bayatsha,
kanti sebetshe bangamadangatye.
Asinakuze ezweni sivumele nokuba ngubani na, nokuba usuka  phi  na,  ukususa
isidima  sabantu  bakowethu  abangamahlwempu,   abangakwaziyo   ukuhlawulela
iinkonzo zawo zikamasipala ngokuthi bathatyathelwe izindlu.  Ixabiso  lendlu
alilingani nexabiso leenkonzo. Ke sithi koomasipala mabayijonge into  yokuba
kukho abantu abangakwazi  kuzihlawula  iinkonzo,  kwaye  asinakuyivuma  into
yokuba   kunikezelwe   ngezo   zindlu.   Ukuba   kufuneka   senze   umthetho
wokuqhakamshelana naloo nto siza kuwenza ngokukhawuleza.

Ingumnqa into yokuba  kubekho  amaphondo  angayisebenzisanga  imali,  iMpuma
Koloni, iNtshona Koloni kunye neGauteng,  kanye  ngeli  xesha  abantu  bethu
behluphekile befuna izindlu. Kufuneka ke kube nguye uMphathiswa  obaphethele
apha okweentsana, ngoba kaloku  bafuna  ukwanyiswa,  abakwazi  ukuzihambela,
kuba basibuyisela emva. Kuliwe apha kweli lizwe lakowethu  ukuze  sibe  kule
ndawo,  kwaye  abantu  bafuna  imisebenzi  nendawo  yokuhlala.  La  maphondo
awakhankanyileyo uMphathiswa ahleli phezu kwemali.

Akukho nzwana ingenasiphako, kodwa olwakhe ugqatso ngathi  uMphathiswa,  uya
ekulufezekiseni. Izingqi zakhe ziyavakala. Ndixhasa olu hlahlo  lwabiwo-mali
lwanamhlanje,  ngakumbi   ngezongezelelo   athe   uMphathiswa,   wazipapasha
namhlanje. Amaqobokazana angalala endleleni yazini kunyembelekile.

Imo  yezulu  mayingabi  sisithintelo  kwakhiweni  kwezindlu.   Thina   phaya
emakhaya siqhele  ukwakha  ngeesoyi,  izitena  zodaka.  Siyalazi  ke  ixesha
lokwakha. Iba ngumnqa into yokuba ubawo uGugile  Nkwinti  athi:  ``Namhlanje
asakhanga eMpuma Koloni ngenxa yokuba bekusina iimvula zobusika'.

Mandithi huntshu! nakuMlawuli Jikelele  ngenxa  yokuba  ngexesha  ebengekho,
uMphathiswa, ebeyiphethe kakuhle kakhulu ikomiti.  Ndiyaluxhasa  ke  uhlahlo
lwabiwo-mali lwanamhlanje. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of  Xhosa  paragraphs
follows.)

[For a person to have dignity and to be dignified, one must  feel  protected
by possessing a warm house. The proper way for the Minister's department  is
to help with the mission to reduce poverty and to improve the lives of  poor
people.

I must congratulate this Minister's department  on  its  clear  and  visible
role, one that is as clear and visible as a goat's path, or grass  that  has
just been cut, now revealing the cat. Our people, mostly  women,  are  proud
today, because they are secured in their houses.

We have seen the Minister moving in and out of bigger and smaller  districts
that  were  unknown,  and  sometimes  doing  so  in  partnership  with   the
governments of other countries. The houses that the Minister  has  built  in
the small area of Lady Grey are amazing. When one enters them on a hot  day,
one finds them cool and in cold weather they are warmed by the rays  of  the
sun.

It takes only about seven days for a little  puppy  to  start  to  see,  but
there are people who are taking  about  eight  years,  while  they  complain
about the progress made by this Government. A person who does  not  want  to
see now will never see.
I am representing poor people, the people in the rural areas, who are  proud
of themselves. I will not be representing them well or doing so fully  if  I
do not speak about their needs. The Minister's department  is  as  quiet  as
the grave with regard to the issue of  development  when  it  comes  to  the
distribution of houses in the rural areas. Yes, in the rural  areas  we  are
used to building our own houses, but because of the existing poverty in  the
country, the people who have built those big houses cannot afford  to  cover
them with a roof. What is the Minister's  department  saying  about  helping
them?

With this housing subsidy in the rural areas we can build big and  beautiful
houses, unlike those that are built in the cities. The  Minister  must  give
us the money and she will see what happens in the rural  areas.  I  issue  a
challenge that, people in the rural areas should also have the benefit of  a
better life, and we  can  introduce  a  Bill  to  prevent  people  from  not
benefiting; we as this committee  are  prepared  to  draft  it  as  soon  as
possible. We are asked, therefore, we do. A child who  does  not  cry  often
enough dies of hunger.

The way that small financial institutions discriminate  against  our  people
is not acceptable. We must gratefully accept the Minister's efforts to  help
the people who are establishing small  businesses  for  themselves  to  save
money, which would help to contribute to the construction  of  houses.  This
is also one of the important aims of the Vukuzenzele campaign.

On the issue of a housing subsidy, I would like to  urge  all  provinces  to
rectify the mistakes of the past, through which the  houses  of  the  people
were built far away from the cities. I have observed that  the  Minister  is
trying to rectify precisely this. We should understand that by doing  so  we
are bringing together the flocks that used to be separate, moving them to  a
place where there are houses, services, roads and jobs.

The Bills  about  a  better  life  for  the  people  that  we  have  already
introduced and passed in this House sound wonderful and beautiful, but  they
are just on paper and are not being implemented. This is a challenge to  all
of us at this  minute  and  in  this  year  of  volunteerism.  As  committee
members, we will always monitor the progress of those in authority  on  this
matter. We will put them under pressure like a big spider  biting  a  beast.
Those who disapprove of the laws that we have struggled  to  institute  will
regret it when they start noticing the change.

We will never allow anyone, from anywhere, to take away the dignity  of  our
poor people by confiscating their houses because they cannot afford  to  pay
for services. House prices and services are not equal.  Therefore,  we  urge
the municipalities to take notice of people who cannot  afford  to  pay  for
their services because we could not allow confiscation of those  houses.  We
are prepared to introduce a Bill on that if there is a need to do so.

It is amazing to know that there are some provinces in this House, like  the
Eastern Cape, the Western Cape  and  Gauteng,  that  have  not  spent  their
budgets, especially in this time of desperation on the part  of  our  people
to  obtain  houses.  Since  the  Minister  has  noticed  this,  it  is   her
responsibility to ensure that  the  people  who  are  responsible  in  these
provinces perform their tasks, as they seem to enjoy  being  monitored  like
little children,  because  they  delay  progress.  People  have  fought  for
democracy in this country of ours in order to get  jobs  and  houses.  Those
provinces that the Minister  has  mentioned  are  sitting  on  the  people's
money.

There is no one without faults, but the Minister appears to be going in  the
right direction in performing her task. The sound of her footsteps is  being
heard. I support today's Budget Vote. We salute the hon the  Minister,  more
especially for the development that she  has  mentioned.  Forward  with  the
women's good efforts!

The weather should not be an excuse not to build houses.  We  in  the  rural
areas are used to building with sods and mud bricks and  therefore  we  know
when to build our houses. It will be a surprise if Mr Gugile  Nkwinti  says:
``Today we did not build in the Eastern Cape because it is winter and it  is
raining.''

Let me say congratulations also to the director-general,  because  when  the
Minister was away, the job was done very  well.  I,  therefore  support  the
Budget Vote. [Applause.]]

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek het nie alles verstaan wat die  vorige  spreker
gesê het nie, maar ek dink ek stem saam met die meeste van wat sy gesê het.

Die  voorreg  om  'n  huis  te  bekom,  hoe  klein  ook  al,  is  seker  die
belangrikste gebeurtenis wat mens op aarde kan beleef. Dit  is  dan  ook  my
party se visie dat elke Suid-Afrikaner  uiteindelik  moet  deel  in  hierdie
wonderlike voorreg. Dit is belangrik dat  die  staat  ook  toesien  dat  die
voorreg om 'n huis  te  besit,  nie  van  die  minderbevoorregte  gemeenskap
weerhou word, of die lewering daarvan vertraag word as gevolg van  korrupsie
of onkundige amptenare nie.

Dis skokkend om vanuit die ouditeur-generaal se verslag  oor  sy  bevindinge
en die prestasie-oudit van verlede jaar wat gedoen is op  provinsiale  vlak,
te verneem dat erge ongerymdhede steeds plaasvind in  dié  verband  in  alle
provinsies. In die genoemde verslag word onder  andere  ook  melding  gemaak
van verskillende faktore wat die lewering van behuising negatief beïnvloed.

In die Vrystaat waar daar 'n geweldige agterstand  in  die  verskaffing  van
behuising is, is daar volgens 'n antwoord op die vraag wat ek  aan  die  agb
Minister gerig het, alleen maar in totaal 990 nuwe subsidies  goedgekeur  en
maar net  2  350  huiseenhede  in  die  Vrystaat  voltooi  in  die  afgelope
finansiële jaar.

Dié stadige beskikbaarstelling van grond vir behuisingsdoeleindes word  deur
die agb LUR as hoofoorsaak genoem vir hierdie  ontstellende  statistiek.  In
dié verband haal ek graag aan uit die begrotingstoespraak van die agb LUR:


  We would like to see  an  increased  pace  of  land  development  in  the
  province. In the past year, we only developed 3 039  erven.  Acceleration
  of this programme is our joint responsibility with municipalities.


  The interim integrated development plans suggest that we have a  197  000
  housing backlog. This makes  the  need  for  rapid  land  release  rather
  urgent.

Ek  is  bewus  daarvan  dat  die  provinsies  te  doen  het  met  verouderde
wetgewing, wat dit vir hulle baie moeilik maak om staatsgrond te  bekom  vir
behuisingsdoeleindes en word dan ook geforseer om addisionele grond  aan  te
koop teen ekstra koste. In dié verband haal ek graag aan uit die  kommentaar
van die Direkteur-generaal vir Behuising in die genoemde ouditeursverslag:


  State, local government or public land is  used  in  many  provinces  for
  housing development. However, such land is  seldom  purchased  at  market
  value due to the respective provincial departments of  land  affairs  not
  having a policy in this regard.

Dit is duidelik dat daar sonder verwyl gekyk moet word  na  die  opstel  van
nuwe wetgewing en beleidsrigtings, wat  provinsies  in  staat  sal  stel  om
staatsgrond betyds te bekom vir hulle behuisingsdoeleindes.

Volgens genoemde ouditeursverslag blyk dit ook dat daar in baie  gevalle  'n
vertraging in die lewering van huisbouprojekte is weens swak beplanning  met
die verskaffing van  aansluitingsdienste.  In  dié  verband  haal  ek  graag
kortliks ook uit dié verslag aan:


  This impacted negatively on  the  completion  of  housing  projects.  For
  example, 20 projects in the Northern Province -

Limpopo


  ... to the value of R166 million were put in  abeyance  due  to  lack  of
  funds.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I did not  understand  everything  the  previous
speaker said, but I think that I agree with most of what she said.

The privilege of acquiring a house, no matter how  small,  is  probably  the
most important event on earth that one can experience. It is accordingly  my
party's vision that every South African  should  eventually  share  in  this
wonderful privilege. It is important that the state also  sees  to  it  that
the privilege  of  owning  a  house  is  not  denied  to  the  disadvantaged
community, or that  its  delivery  is  not  delayed  due  to  corruption  or
ignorant officials.

It is shocking to learn from the auditor-general's report on  his  findings,
as well as the performance  audit  of  last  year  which  was  done  at  the
provincial level, of severe anomalies  that  are  still  occurring  in  this
regard in all provinces. In the above-mentioned report various factors  that
are influencing the delivery of housing negatively  are,  inter  alia,  also
mentioned.

In the Free State, where there is an enormous backlog in  the  provision  of
housing, the position, according to an answer to a question  I  put  to  the
hon the Minister, is that a total of only 990 new subsidies  were  approved,
and only 2 350 housing units were completed in the Free State  in  the  past
financial year.

This slow release of land for housing purposes has  been  mentioned  by  the
hon MEC as the main cause of these disturbing statistics. In this  regard  I
would like to quote from the budget speech of the hon MEC:


  We would like to see  an  increased  pace  of  land  development  in  the
  province. In the past year, we only developed 3 039  erven.  Acceleration
  of this programme is our joint responsibility with municipalities.


  The interim integrated development plans suggest that we have a  197  000
  housing backlog. This makes  the  need  for  rapid  land  release  rather
  urgent.
I am aware of the fact  that  the  provinces  are  dealing  with  antiquated
legislation which makes it very difficult for them  to  acquire  state  land
for housing purposes, and then they are also forced to  purchase  additional
land at extra  cost.  In  this  regard  I  would  like  to  quote  from  the
commentary of  the  Director-General  for  Housing  in  the  above-mentioned
auditor's report:


  State, local government or public land is  used  in  many  provinces  for
  housing development. However, such land is  seldom  purchased  at  market
  value due to the respective provincial departments of  land  affairs  not
  having a policy in this regard.

It is clear that we have to look at the  drafting  of  new  legislation  and
policies without delay, which will enable provinces to  acquire  state  land
timeously for their housing purposes.

According to the above-mentioned auditor's report it would seem  that  there
are also  many  instances  of  delays  in  the  delivery  of  house-building
projects due to poor planning with regard to  the  provision  of  connection
services. In this regard I would once again like to quote briefly from  this
report:


  This impacted negatively on  the  completion  of  housing  projects.  For
  example, 20 projects in the Northern Province -

Limpompo -


  ... to the value of R166 million were put in  abeyance  due  to  lack  of
  funds.]

Better  interdepartmental  co-ordination  is  necessary  to   resolve   this
problem. It was very encouraging to hear from the  hon  the  Minister  today
that the department has shifted emphasis to the more qualitative aspects  of
delivery at this stage. My party is convinced  that  medium-density  housing
will definitely contribute in adding quality to housing projects.

We also agree with the hon the Minister that social  housing  projects  will
be one of the most effective strategies of implementing medium  density,  in
that the beneficiaries are also involved in the  management  of  the  houses
and will hopefully keep them in good condition.

The beneficiary contribution of R2 479 that will now be a  prerequisite  for
getting the Government housing subsidy will also facilitate the  improvement
of the quality of houses. I am also convinced  that  self-building  projects
will also play a major role in producing quality housing.  The  increase  in
the subsidy grants to beneficiaries will also contribute to the building  of
better-quality and more houses.

In conclusion, my party appreciate the fact that the Government has  already
approved an HIV/Aids policy to  provide  cluster  housing  for  orphans  and
housing communities that will be  able  to  sustain  families  infected  and
affected by Aids. I appeal again today to  the  hon  the  Minister  to  make
these  projects  a  very  high  priority.  My  party  supports   the   Vote.
[Applause.]

Mr S L TSENOLI (Free State): Chairperson, may  I  rise  in  support  of  the
Budget on housing? I would also like to extend my  thanks  to  the  Minister
for having come to the province twice in a very short space of time. For  us
and the beneficiaries on the ground, such visibility is very  important.  It
demonstrates that our leadership cares and that we are working together,  as
government, at a national, provincial and local  level.  We  appreciate  the
hon the Minister's responsiveness.

The housing process is a very political one. We have  an  obligation  to  do
it, in order to satisfy  the  human  rights  of  people  out  there.  It  is
particularly important that this month we are celebrating the sixth year  of
the adoption of our new Constitution. That Constitution laid the  foundation
for the work that we are doing. The progressive steps  that  we  take  every
day are in line with the satisfaction of  the  people's  deepest  aspiration
for housing. Deepening democracy and accountability is also a process  which
we are involved in, because,  as  the  hon  the  Minister  said,  there  are
aspects of housing delivery that involve beneficiaries in the  construction,
financing and building of their own homes, so that participatory  democracy,
complementing  representative  democracy,  is  a  very  important  political
programme that we are involved  in  in  this  country.  Housing  is  a  very
important part of that process.

It is also an important stimulant in the local economy. Every house that  we
build produces jobs and creates opportunities. It keeps jobs that  exist  in
the firms that supply materials and so on. So it is a very  important  local
economic stimulant. It is also very critical  in  the  social  life  of  our
people and in the provision of health. With every house  that  is  provided,
the impact on the health of the people is  huge.  The  electrification  that
goes with it is critical.

In our province and, I guess, in the country  as  a  whole,  the  integrated
development plans will, for the first time, formally inform the  budgets  of
municipalities. One of the responsibilities that we have, as departments  of
local governments in the provinces, is to manage these  relationships,  with
the  effective  involvement  of  provincial  and  national  departments,  in
providing detailed information about  money  and  resource  plans  for  each
municipality, so that they  can  plan  the  work  of  services  effectively.
Housing is one of the  critical  components  of  that  process.  So  we  are
involved not only in the management  of  the  relationship  of  the  various
spheres of government for the effective support  of  local  government,  but
also  in  the  management  of  developers  and  contractors   and   of   the
beneficiaries themselves.

It is on the management of these relationships  that  I  want  to  come  in,
because, in speaking about underexpenditure, we  must  recognise  that,  for
example, as we speak, the underexpenditure that we are talking about in  the
provinces relates to the fact that we have contractual obligations. We  have
allocated housing to  areas.  What  is  happening  there  is  the  effective
project management of these relationships, so  that  housing  gets  off  the
ground.

The various parts of our work partly  to  undo  the  apartheid  spatial  and
legislative obstacles is what is  at  the  heart  of  the  problems  we  are
confronting. For example, in Mangaung in the area of Botshabelo, which  used
to be an R293 town, the land  is  still  separately  owned.  We  must  still
effectively change the ordinances and the legislation, so  that  people  can
begin to construct there. Some of the projects are delayed for that  reason.
We have a major programme of reviewing outdated  ordinances  and  pieces  of
legislation that must be removed from the  Statute  Book,  so  that  we  can
effectively manage projects and have housing hitting the  ground  and  being
built. We have to raise these issues because they often obscure what  is  in
the way of the construction of housing.

The other important thing is that we must  not  underestimate  the  capacity
that we are also  concerned  with  at  municipal  level.  One  of  the  most
important parts of the refocusing orientation that is  beginning  to  emerge
overall is that  local  government  must  increasingly  participate  in  the
development of housing. All along, they have not. This  work  has,  in  most
instances, been done  by  developers  without  effective  and  comprehensive
involvement of local government. Now  we  are  talking  about  working  with
municipalities  to  build  their  capacity,  to  work  with  us  in  project
management of the construction of housing. It is for that  reason  that  the
IDPs are so important, in  that  it  is  on  the  basis  of  the  integrated
development plans that municipalities will decide the  location  of  housing
and other services, so that when we provide allocations  to  municipalities,
housing will be built on the  basis  of  those  plans  and  they  will  have
resources to provide other services that go with the housing development.

We have done very important  work  in  the  Free  State.  We  have  examined
intensively the reasons for the delay in  the  completion  of  projects.  We
have identified more  than  seven  key  areas.  But  when  we  look  at  the
implementation that comes out of that  examination,  we  can  identify  four
critical areas in which we have already started  implementation.  The  first
one is the departmental  capacity  to  expand  our  numbers  of  people  who
inspect  housing  as  it  is  built,  so  that  as  various  phases  of  the
construction are completed, developers are paid and, in  fact,  the  housing
is examined for appropriate quality workmanship.

Secondly, we are  talking  about  staffing  at  appropriate  levels  in  the
department and the capacity of developers and  contractors.  Some  of  these
are black contractors and  developers  who  are  new  in  the  industry  and
awaiting capacity-building and so forth, unable to manage  a  project  in  a
sustainable manner because they are new. In collaboration with the  national
Department of Public Works, we have programmes that are  aimed  at  building
the capacity of these fields, including giving them access to  finance,  but
also enabling them to grow and providing subsidies on a  sustainable  basis,
so that there are no stops along the way in the construction process.

Thirdly, there is beneficiary empowerment. One of  the  greatest  powers  we
have given beneficiaries is the right to sign a  happy  letter.  That  happy
letter says that the beneficiary is going  into  that  home  because  it  is
properly  constructed,  of  good  quality  workpersonship.  But  there   are
problems when beneficiaries are not  able  to  do  so  and  they  are  taken
advantage of, owing to their illiteracy  and  because  others  are  able  to
manipulate the system. They  therefore  often  occupy  homes  that  are  not
properly built and so forth.

It is  one  of  the  critical  components  of  our  beneficiary  empowerment
programmes.  I  have  spoken  about   building   the   capacity   of   local
municipalities. In the Free State we have  produced  a  Free  State  Housing
Charter.  It  spells  out  in  very  specific  terms  what  we  expect   the
municipalities to  do,  but  we  have  also  summed  up  various  pieces  of
legislation that spell out what municipalities' responsibilities are.

We must remember, the system of local government in  this  country  is  new.
All the role-players, councillors and officials,  have  to  internalise  the
system. Nobody is a veteran of the system. Many of the  people  involved  in
this are new, as are the legislation and the systems in place.  We  have  to
play a big role in assisting them, firstly, to understand by reminding  them
of their responsibilities. We also have to assist them critically  to  build
capacity for internalising their ability to play an  active  role,  so  that
ultimately we accredit those who build  capacity  in  time,  but  also  help
those  who  will  play  a  role  in  developmental  facilitation  with   the
appropriate capacity.

These are the four areas which we think will play a  critical  role  in  the
implementation programmes that we are talking  about.  Three  weeks  ago  we
allocated 10 000 subsidies to 20 municipalities in the Free State.  We  were
doing that quite consciously. Those that  we  have  contractual  obligations
with, which we have stalled, will be started again, and we will be  able  to
spend the money that has been allocated to us.

We are very grateful for the increases that have being made, and we  support
the budget. [Time expired.]

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, we support the budget before us.
I wish to raise the matter of the  Western  Cape  Rental  Housing  Tribunal,
which was approved in August 2001, in terms of the Rental Housing Act 50  of
1999, with the Minister. The purpose of the tribunal is to resolve  disputes
between landlords and tenants, including the government sector. So far,  the
tribunal in the Western Cape, which is only one of two which exist in  South
Africa - the other is in  Gauteng  -  has  had  much  success.  Some  2  851
complaints have been received by the unit, including  telephonic  enquiries,
visits by the public and formal case  files.  There  have  already  been  10
hearings, and 20 cases were dealt with.

The tribunal is working wonderfully well, and most enquiries have  not  been
dealt with by the tribunal, but have been dealt with by the unit,  and  have
been satisfactorily resolved, interestingly enough, half in  favour  of  the
tenants and half in favour of the landlords. So they are even-handed in  the
way they go about their work. Most cases have been  resolved  by  mediation.
The findings of  the  tribunal  have  the  same  status  as  orders  of  the
magistrates' court.

There is, however, room for improvement in  the  light  of  experience.  The
process at the moment is a  finding,  usually  adhered  to  by  the  parties
concerned. However, if they do not abide by the finding,  the  tribunal  and
the complainant have to go to the police  together  to  lay  a  charge.  The
police then have to investigate. This can take weeks,  and  the  complainant
may suffer eviction and be out on the street. Then the case is taken to  the
magistrates' court.

The procedure I want to suggest, which is for the Minister to  consider,  is
that if a finding of the tribunal is not abided by, the tribunal  should  be
able to take the matter directly to the  magistrates'  court  to  be  heard,
without first  laying  charges  with  the  police.  We  need  to  give  this
essential consumer service in housing the teeth that it  deserves  and  that
it requires. It has gone exceptionally well, but as we go  forward,  and  as
landlords and tenants realise what  their  rights  are,  they  may  well  be
abused.  So  we  ask  the  Minister  to  consider  this.  Gauteng  has  also
established such a tribunal. We  recommend  to  other  provinces  that  they
follow suit. It works well.

The House congratulates Mr Theron, the first chairman of  the  Western  Cape
Rental Housing Tribunal, and his small staff on their excellent work.

This is the first appearance in this House of my colleague the MEC from  the
Western Cape government. We welcome her and  wish  her  very  well  for  the
future. She should also listen to what I have to say  regarding  a  consumer
court being contemplated by the Western Cape. May  I  suggest  to  the  MECs
here that as such a court and rental  tribunal  would  both  need  premises,
perhaps they could cut costs and  share  premises,  because  their  premises
would be very similar. One would then provide a focus for  consumer  affairs
where the public could go.

The Minister may be aware of section 21 companies that deliver quite  a  lot
of houses in South Africa: Garden Cities is one, Community Care is  another.
Now, Sars has come up with a section 30, in which  they  say  a  section  21
company has to prove that it is acting for the indigent before they will  be
able to get tax rebates. [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time is up.

Mr K D S DURR: We support the legislation. [Applause.]

Mr M S GININDZA (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, Minister,  hon  members  of  this
House, it is obvious that I rise to support this vote. We declared long  ago
that there shall be houses, security and comfort.

It is on the basis of this  commitment  that  we  want  to  share  with  hon
members  some  ideas  about  the  strengthened  focus  of   the   Mpumalanga
department of housing and land administration. By ``strengthened focus''  we
imply that the department  has  embarked  upon  strengthened  strategies  of
addressing the question of the size and  quality  of  the  RDP  houses.  The
guiding principle adopted is one of an integrated  approach  to  sustainable
housing delivery and development.

There is always room for improvement. It is  again  on  the  basis  of  this
principle that we have considered the question of the size and  the  quality
of the RDP houses. Added to this is the critical issue of the  size  of  the
stands on which RDP houses are erected. The strengthened  strategy  embodied
in the focus seeks to roll out  a  process  of  RDP  housing  delivery  that
ensures an improvement in equality and a reduction of vulnerability.

The poorest of the poor must benefit in the whole  process  of  RDP  housing
delivery. It is therefore envisaged that efforts  should  be  made  to  have
bigger and better quality houses which also benefit the  poor,  economically
and in terms of skills. One may contend that there is  no  logic  that  says
that a poor person deserves an inferior quality house. On  the  contrary,  a
poor person remains a person with  human  dignity,  and  therefore  deserves
everything that a person, as a human being, deserves.

Housing  delivery  has  a  sociocultural  and  economic   impact.   In   the
sociocultural milieu, the size  of  a  house  is  critical.  Coming  from  a
historically  disadvantaged,  poor  community,  it  is  not   difficult   to
appreciate that the present norm of 32 square metres is  grossly  inadequate
for a poor family.

It must be noted that housing delivery  implies  that  the  provision  of  a
home, and not merely houses, is important. By that understanding it  is  not
require a stretch of the imagination to clearly recognise  the  need  for  a
bigger house for families known to be  characterised  by  extended  families
and family members.

Building a  bigger  house  is  possible  through  some  of  the  instruments
available and through the Vukuzenzele principle. While it is impractical  to
provide bigger and better houses because of obvious  financial  constraints,
a moderately bigger house can serve the needs of an extended family  better.
Besides, a relatively bigger  stand  provides  an  opportunity  for  such  a
family to extend the house in future when a member can afford to do so.
The strengthened strategies must address this critical  issue  of  the  size
and quality of houses. In this regard, local developers and contractors  are
being invited to come and  inspect  some  new  RDP  plans  prepared  by  the
department. Such plans are to be taken away by contractors to  discuss  with
their principals and make changes and suggestions. This process must  be  of
some benefit to the people both in monetary terms and skills development.

Contractors and developers from historically disadvantaged communities  must
be accorded the  opportunity  to  actualise  themselves.  The  potential  is
there, and we all know that. In the economic milieu, poverty alleviation  is
crucial to attaining meaningful democracy. Political theorists agree on  the
need to balance political and economic powers. Political independence  needs
be to correlated with economic independence.

In a humble way, the process of housing delivery  must  offer  job  creation
opportunities. When an emerging contractor is skilled  the  doors  of  self-
employment are open. Disposable income  is  appreciably  increased,  coupled
with higher purchasing power. Housing delivery impacts  on  the  economy  as
self-employable   people   replace   job-seekers.   This   is    sustainable
development.

Land delivery must also benefit the  poor.  It  has  been  observed  that  a
bigger house on a bigger stand has the potential of developing into a  home.
This  is  also  a  poverty-alleviating  goal  to  which  the  department  is
committed. A bigger stand for a historically  disadvantaged  beneficiary  is
not ground for luxury. On the contrary, it is an opportunity  to  supplement
household income by way of  backyard  gardening,  peasant  poultry  farming,
etc.

In our vision, we envisage a department determined to travel the extra  mile
to provide housing and  effective  land  management  services  to  create  a
better life for all. In  conclusion,  we  want  to  thank  the  Minister  of
Housing for the manner in which she steers the boat in the right  direction.
Make, siyakubonga, umuhle. [We thank you, you are wonderful.] [Applause.]
Mr  T  RALANE:  Chairperson,  Minister,  MECs,  special  delegates  and  hon
members, the ANC places  a  very  high  premium  on  the  social  and  human
development of our  people.  Great  focus  is  therefore  placed  on  public
expenditure in areas that are crucial to the social  and  human  development
of people, particularly housing, education and health.

Given the high premium which our Government places on the wellbeing  of  our
people, it is no surprise that expenditure on  housing  for  this  year  has
significantly  increased.  This  increase  is  in  line  with   Government's
objectives of economic growth, job creation and poverty alleviation.

Housing is one of the key deliverables in generating growth, employment  and
wealth.  The  billions  Government  spends  annually  on  housing  sudsidies
sustains more than 80 000 direct and indirect  employment  opportunities  in
the building industry and the building materials and component markets.

The struggle against homelessness in our country  is  a  massive  challenge.
This is largely as a result  of  the  enormous  housing  backlog  which  was
caused by the racist housing policy framework inherited from  the  apartheid
era.

One of the first things the ANC did was  to  put  in  place  a  new  housing
policy framework based on the principles of  equity  and  nondiscrimination.
The new approach to housing was based on partnership between  various  tiers
of government, not only to address the massive backlog,  but  also  to  give
meaning to the notion of people-centred development.

Under the new policy framework, the Minister of Housing and  her  department
has  performed  remarkably  well  in  a  very  difficult   and   challenging
environment. Much of this success has been made possible  by  the  effective
co-operation between national, provincial and local  government.  Provincial
government has, through the regular policy dialogue in  Minmec,  been  fully
engaged, while the successful transformation  of  local  government  ensured
its involvement and commitment to the delivery of housing.

In all of this the National Council  of  Provinces  has  played  a  critical
role. It provided the platform through which the three levels of  government
were able to develop a coherent and integrated approach towards meeting  the
housing needs of our people.

The ANC, under the capable leadership of the hon the  Minister  of  Housing,
has completely transformed the old housing environment  from  one  based  on
racism and discrimination to one that seeks  to  fulfil  the  needs  of  all
South Africans. In terms of the new policy framework, all  existing  housing
support institutions were overhauled and made  sensitive  to  the  needs  of
poor South Africans. New mechanisms, such as  the  housing  subsidy  scheme,
were created to facilitate the acquisition of finance for  those  who  could
not previously afford  to  build  their  own  houses.  New  legislation  was
enacted to protect new  owners  against  unscrupulous  builders,  landlords,
inferior workmanship and discriminatory practices by  lending  institutions,
and to curb the abuse of syndicates who buy  houses  built  with  government
subsidies for next to nothing.

In addition, the ANC has also initiated a People's Housing Process  focusing
mainly  on  the  efforts  of  poor  communities  to  improve  their   living
conditions. The People's Housing Process is based on the  fact  that  people
have  always  built  their  own  houses  by  applying  the  vast  wealth  of
traditional know-how. This process is aimed at building the capacity of  and
supporting  poor  communities  to  improve  their   living   conditions   by
developing technical skills, by facilitating and promoting  housing  support
centres and by recognising the role of organised community-based  structures
and nongovernmental organisations as key movers in the process.

The more than one million houses  that  have  been  built  since  1994  bear
testimony to the success of ANC's new housing policies  and  strategies.  If
one takes into consideration  the  vast  number  of  electricity  and  water
connections that have been established since 1994,  it  is  clear  that  the
ANC's delivery programme has contributed dramatically towards improving  the
quality of life of millions of South Africans.

Despite these successes there are still serious challenges ahead. While  our
country has harnessed community resources in an effort to  meet  and  exceed
housing targets, some financial institutions are  still  reluctant  to  give
loans to the poor, which they identify as a high-risk undertaking.

While some inroads have been made in changing  such  perceptions,  the  poor
still face difficulties in accessing the  desired  levels  of  credit.  Such
attitudes are a result of South Africa's painful history  and  are  directly
linked to discrimination and subtle racism.

Over the last couple of months we have  also  seen  a  number  of  cases  of
people being evicted from their houses because  they  could  not  repay  the
loans with which they built their houses or were unable to pay  their  rates
and services.

This is a serious problem that threatens to destroy the  hard-won  gains  we
have made in terms of delivering houses to the poor, who  are  the  majority
and who in most cases do not have  regular  incomes.  Whilst  I  agree  that
those who can pay should in fact be compelled to pay for services  delivered
to them, those who do not earn regular incomes and cannot pay even  if  they
want to are the poorest of the poor, and, if we do not create some  sort  of
mechanism to protect them, they will descend into even greater  poverty  and
despair.

What is more disturbing is the fact that many of  those  who  face  eviction
only know about their fate when officials come knocking at  their  doors  to
evict  them  and  the  bulldozers  rattle  into  action.  Such   undignified
treatment must have no place in our democracy. If people  know  about  plans
to evict them well in advance, I am sure they will  take  steps  to  prevent
their possible eviction. What is needed, therefore, is  information.  People
should be informed as soon as eviction proceedings are executed.  This  will
enable them to seek counselling on legal aspects  of  evictions  and  obtain
information on available financial support. The ANC  supports  this  budget.
[Applause.]

[Mr B MABASO: Hon Chairperson, Minister of Housing,  Mrs  Mthembi-Mahanyele,
all MECs and hon Chairpersons of all Houses present, hon members  and  South
African  citizens,  I  greet  and  respect   you.   The   Gauteng   province
congratulates you, hon Minister, on the good  work  under  your  leadership.
The success of your work brings peace to South African citizens.]

I want to speak of the adjustment of the  quantum  of  the  housing  subsidy
first. The original subsidy amounts have been adjusted  for  inflation  over
the past three years, bringing the new subsidy amount up to R20 300.

It is significant that this increase of the subsidy quantum  coincides  with
the implementation of the warranty scheme  of  the  National  Home  Builders
Registration Council. This warranty scheme relates to the ``housing  subsidy
only'' market, and seeks to provide these houses with a five-year  warranty.
With the exception of the aged and disabled, everyone will  be  required  to
contribute an amount of R2 499 for the warranty.  Those  who  are  destitute
and unable to contribute money upfront will be required  to  participate  in
the People's Housing Process to build their own houses.

My next topic  is  the  savings-linked  subsidy  scheme.  Hi  tlhela  hi  mi
hoyozela! [We congratulate you again!] This is a very important scheme.  The
scheme attempts to maximise the gearing of state  funding,  while  providing
incentives  for  the  target  community  to  save.  The  Gauteng  provincial
government supports this programme since it  encourages  people  to  make  a
contribution of their own to  supplement  Government  resources.  This  will
instill a sense of pride and ownership and discourage the illegal  sales  of
Government-provided houses, which have been so rife to date.

N'wana a nga velekeriwi. Mutswari loyi a nga twaku vava hi  ku  tisa  n'wana
laha emisaveni a nge pfuki a n'wi xavisile. Similary. Yindlu  layi  munhu  a

cannot bear a child for someone else. A biological parent who felt the  pain
when bringing a child into this world will never sell  her  child.  A  house
which one obtained through hard work and sweat one will never sell.]

With regard to policy and legislation, I wish to applaud  the  Minister  for
strengthening the social housing approach through  the  development  of  two
key pieces of legislation, namely the Social Housing Bill and the  Community
Reinvestment (Housing) Bill.

With regard to the Social Housing Bill, this Bill  is  designed  to  promote
and  establish  a  sustainable  social  housing   process,   while   guiding
Government  in  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  the  delivery  and
development of social housing. The Bill creates an avenue for gearing  state
and private sector resources and funding in order to provide quality  houses
and services to our people.

The Bill goes further to recognise that social housing contributes to  urban
regeneration  and  development  initiatives.  Its  objectives  also  include
giving statutory recognition to  housing  institutions  as  important  role-
players in the housing delivery process. Given  that  social  housing  is  a
stated priority of Gauteng's housing strategy, the new policy will serve  to
strengthen our efforts.

The  Community  Reinvestment  (Housing)  Bill  is  meant  to   provide   the
specification of minimum targets  and  standards  for  lending  at  low  and
medium-income levels. The Bill  will  enable  us  to  move  a  step  further
towards ensuring that low and  medium-income  people  have  access  to  home
loans from the banks. The Bill will effectively  outlaw  practices  such  as
redlining and compel banks to invest in the previously neglected areas.

Our initiatives in Gauteng to draw financial institutions into the  low-cost
housing market are beginning  to  bear  fruit.  This  Bill  should  help  to
further our efforts to  have  a  meaningful  partnership  with  the  banking
sector to contribute to a better life for our poor citizens.

Let me immediately mention that in Gauteng we had  a  major  gathering  last
week, led by our MEC the hon Paul  Mashatile.  He  called  all  stakeholders
together and there was a day-long workshop, but it was remarkable that  most
of the stakeholders stayed from the beginning to the  end.  Each  and  every
stakeholder articulated his or her problems and together  we  would  go  and
find solutions.

In  conclusion,  Gauteng  acknowledges  the  provincial  allocation  to  the
housing fund for this financial year. We assure the  Minister  of  effective
use of this fund in accordance  with  the  national  housing  programme.  We
support this Budget Vote and I apologise on behalf of  our  MEC,  who  could
not be here owing to other  commitments.  He  sends  his  humble  apologies.
[Applause.]

Cllr M RAVHUANZWO (Salga):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  MECs  present
here, hon members and special delegates, the housing programme to  date  has
clearly demonstrated the will of the  Government  to  address  some  of  the
worst legacies of the past. In essence, it allows  over  a  million  people,
1,325 million in fact, to be a functional part of their  communities,  towns
and cities, and it allows millions more  the  hope  that  their  dreams  are
realisable in the foreseeable future.

The value placed in people by this Government, rendering  meaning  to  their
lives and giving them a place to  build  and  contribute  to  our  villages,
towns  and  cities  and  therefore  to  our  country  and  its  economy,  is
immeasurable. The making of meaningful citizens,  ready  to  participate  in
public  life  through  institutions  at  local  level,   and   creating   an
environment for good governance become  the  building  blocks  for  economic
growth and wealth creation.

As organised  local  government,  we  are  aware  of  the  centrality  of  a
successful housing programme and place great value on the  manner  in  which
the Minister has steered  the  programme  to  date.  The  evolution  of  the
housing programme, under her guidance, into  an  instrument  for  developing
sustainable human settlements, is much more clearly articulated.

The paradigm shift in which housing is used as a  developmental  instrument,
from the one that used to address one  of  the  most  horrific  legacies  of
apartheid, the exclusion from the dignity of being  housed  properly,  to  a
multifaceted  instrument  of  economic   empowerment   for   the   poor   is
significant.

The critical issues highlighted in this shift are  welcomed  as  significant
contributions to the construction of better living  environments,  and  make
valued interventions for local government. Starting with an emphasis on  the
centrality of the contribution the  beneficiary  has  to  make  to  housing,
enriches us as a country.  Making  savings  or  sweat  equity  an  essential
requirement  reinforces  the  greater  principles   of   self-reliance   and
partnership, and hence shared risk and joint  benefits.  It  contributes  to
building citizenship,  and  people  taking  responsibility  for  themselves,
while Government creates the  enabling  mechanism  to  realise  the  housing
opportunity. This amounts to a real contribution  of  approximately  10%  of
the subsidy from Government, a very fair and reasonable contribution  to  be
requested.

The increase in the actual subsidy amount of between 28,87%  and  57,64%  to
date, is more than just inflation-related. It will continue to  provide  the
formula that has produced real  housing,  not  just  minimal  shelter.  When
coupled to own contributions, it will begin to provide the  kinds  of  dream
homes that people have talked about and planned for years.

The significant structuring of the subsidy to emphasise quality goes a  long
way to building  viable  and  meaningful  communities,  and  functional  and
vibrant towns and cities. The emphasis on rental housing as a  direct  means
of facilitating medium-density development, so as to create  more  efficient
towns and cities, is a significant contribution for effective management  of
cities and the commitments to sustainable built environments.

Coupling the  quality  emphasis  with  people  taking  more  responsibility,
through their  own  contributions  and  structuring  at  a  resourced  NHBRC
programme  to  oversee  quality  of  homes  constructed,  adds  strength  to
building better  cities.  This  contributes  to  confident  communities  and
assists with the notion of effective governance.

The drive  towards  building  strong  institutions  that  enhance  citizens'
participation in housing is to be commended. The  development  of  a  strong
social  housing  institution,  the  Social  Housing  Foundation,  with   its
enabling instruments, the upcoming Social Housing Bill  and  the  Office  of
the Registrar of  Social  Housing  Institutions,  will  provide  much-needed
support to the emerging housing associations.

This institutionalised form of housing management for the poor provides  the
building blocks for ensuring access to decent housing and  provides  support
to  the  housing  market.  These  are  the  fundamentals  for  growing   and
competitive cities, the very cities which we are  likely  to  depend  on  to
grow us out of  poverty  into  prosperity.  This  is  one  of  the  critical
building blocks of the Urban Renewal Programme, a programme to  which  local
government is unwaveringly committed.

It is this shift to creating the conditions for better  risk  management  in
the  housing  market  that  we  feel  provides  the   stepping   stones   to
economically vibrant towns  and  cities.  To  date,  the  housing  financing
policies  of  the  financial  institutions  have  served  to  entrench   the
apartheid inequities by redlining predominantly black areas. We feel  it  is
timely for the move towards engaging the  financial  institutions  on  their
role in the housing programme.

The Government has demonstrated its resolve in aspects where the  market  is
unable to function effectively. In turn, the  draft  Community  Reinvestment
(Housing) Bill is a step in the right direction.  The  Government  resolving
to set in place a programme dedicated to  quality  improvements  in  housing
delivery  needs  an   equal   demonstration   by   the   housing   financial
institutions.

In trying to conclude, it needs to be said that more still has  to  be  done
with regard to alignment of  policy,  programmes,  structures,  systems  and
procedures across spheres of government. The need to do so is predicated  on
the  fact  that  strong  local  government  is  at  the  heart  of  building
democracy. With strong democratic local government,  the  task  of  aligning
resources will begin to address what has been a long-standing  complaint  of
new housing residents, the absence of integrated  services,  which  will  be
better addressed by the integrated development plan.

This lack of co-ordination,  linked  to  delays  because  of  administrative
lapses in systems and  procedures,  continue  to  plague  our  newly  housed
communities. The strong administrative hand of the housing  programme  needs
to be extended much more aggressively with local government, to give  effect
to the task of building  effective  and  sustainable  human  settlements.  A
concerted effort in co-operative programmes for housing needs to be  focused
on. It is not merely capacity-building, but a dedicated effort  at  managing
integration that is needed. This in turn will  see  a  much  more  effective
housing delivery programme, but more significantly,  much  more  viable  and
functional communities being built.

As Salga we support the Budget Vote and we wish the  Minister  well  in  her
programmes and activities for the year. [Applause.]

Mnu  T   M   SHABALALA   (KwaZulu-Natal):   Mphathisihlalo,   neNdlu   yakho
nabakungqongile, mhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe wethu esimthanda kakhulu  nomnyango
wakhe,  bafowethu  nodadewethu  abavela  ezifundazweni   ezahlukene,   kwaze
kwamnandi, ngizoke ngishaye  isiZulu  sakithi  lapha.  Udadewethu  uMajodina
ushaye  ngolimi  lwakubo  wangigeza  ngaphakathi.   (Translation   of   Zulu
paragraph follows.)

[Mr T M SHABALALA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson and  the  House  before  you,
our hon Minister, who we admire, together with her department, brothers  and
sisters from different provinces, it is very  good,  I  am  going  to  speak
Zulu, my home language. My sister  Majodina  spoke  her  language  and  that
pleased me very much.]

First of all, I must start by  congratulating  our  hon  Minister,  and  her
department, for the hard work she has done for our communities. We are  very
pleased about the budget speech that was  delivered  nationally,  which  was
prepared and delivered with strong confidence in our entire society.

Hhayi njengomuntu wesimame noma wesifazane, njengomama nje wethu. [Not as  a
woman or a female, but like our mother.]

In the past they used to say that behind a successful man there is a  woman.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.] Now we are saying, next to a  successful  woman
there is a man. [Laughter.] We received the budget speech  in  KwaZulu-Natal
and it was discussed by the portfolio committee, the hon  the  Minister  and
his department, as well as the KwaZulu-Natal parliament.

We came to a positive conclusion, that we support it. Although  we  do  have
those elements who  always  disagree  with  everything  done  by  us  or  by
somebody else, the majority agreed.

The increase in the housing subsidy  was  well  applauded  by  many  of  our
people and this will change the people's perception  in  that  they  have  a
Government that is really  committed  to  providing  everybody  with  proper
housing. We know where we come from,  and  we  can  see  now  where  we  are
heading.
NgesiZulu sithi: Sekuyakhanya ezansi. [In Zulu we say: Darkness is  starting
to disappear.]

Due to time constraints I will not elaborate much on  all  the  points  that
were mentioned in the budget speech, because I respect my sister  behind  me
who also comes from KwaZulu-Natal. We respect ladies. She will do a  lot  of
the speaking and I will be short, because for a tall man like  me  to  speak
for four minutes only ... [Laughter.]

Ngithi kumhlonishwa uNgqonqgoshe laphaya, KwaZulu-Natali,  imisebenzi  yakhe
siyayibona. Sithi makangesabi, makaziqhenye ngoba wenza izimanga.  Sizohlale
sinaye ngisho ngabe esefake i-overall  ebovu,  eshaya  ngomshini.  Sizohlale
sinaye  udadewethu  futhi  imisebenzi  yakhe  siyayesekela.  Siyazi   ukuthi
kunzima phambili futhi siyazi ukuthi siphuma kuphi -  lapho  abantu  bakithi
bebakhelwa  khona  lezi  zindlu  esithukwa  ngazo  kodwa  zibe  kade  zisuke
ezimalini  zethu,  ebesingacatshangelwa  ngazo  ukuthi  zibuyiselwe  kithina
bantu abamnyama.

Thina sinoNgqongqoshe  ngisho  noma  ngabe  singahlukana  ngokwezinhlangano,
nanganoma yini enye, kodwa sizohlala sinaye emsebenzini  wakhe.  Uma  umuntu
esebenza kahle siye sithi KwaZulu usebenza kahle. Ngithi makabhasobhe  ngoba
ngizomvotela okhethweni olulandelayo. [Ihlombe.]

Ngithi kudadewethu kuzo zonke izifundazwe kufanele kubanjiswane.  Le  nkinga
yezindlu kusafuneka siyibambe lapho ikhona. (Translation of Zulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[I would like to say to the hon Minister that at home  in  KwaZulu-Natal  we
see the fruits of her work. We say she should not fear  anything,  she  must
be proud, because she is performing miracles. We will  always  be  with  her
even though she wears a red overall, and is operating the machine.  We  will
always be with her, and we support her work. We know it is tough  where  she
is heading, and we know the history  -  where  houses  were  built  for  our
people, the houses that we were abused for even though they were built  with
our money, and which we did not get, as they  were  not  given  back  to  us
black people.

Although the Minister and we  belong  to  different  political  parties,  or
differ, whatever the case may be, we will always be with her  in  her  work.
In KwaZulu-Natal when a person works well we say that person is doing  well.
I say she must watch out, because I am going to vote for  her  in  the  next
elections. [Applause.]

I would like to say to my sister that there should be  co-operation  in  all
provinces.]

We will never cover the backlog if we do not look at what we must  do  about
repossessed houses, and that is what the banks  are  doing  to  our  people.
Some of them do not even follow the procedures  for  repossessing  a  house.
[Interjections.] They just come with a very big business. I started this  in
1995, so I know what I am talking about.

Kukhona  izinto  ezimangalisayo  okudingeka  zibhekisiswe   uma   kungukuthi
izindlu  zabantu  bakithi  zithathwa  zidayiswe  nge-R100   bese   zithengwa
yizikhulu  ezinkulu  zezinye  izinhlanga,  abantu  bakithi  balale  emnyango
ngalolo  suku  ngoba  bekhishiwe  futhi  kube  kungalandelwanga   nazindlela
zokwenza izinto ngokufanele.

Ngithi-ke kumhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe makaqhubeke nomsebenzi  wakhe.  Ngibonga
bonke abalapha eNdlini ngendlela abakhulume  ngayo.  Bengizokhuluma  kakhulu
kodwa izwi lami lincane futhi alilihle.  [Ihlombe.]   (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[There is something that needs to be looked at carefully if  the  houses  of
our people are going to be sold to big people of other races for  R100,  and
our people have to sleep outside that day because they  have  been  evicted,
and that while the proper channels were not followed.

I would like to say that the hon  the  Minister  should  continue  with  her
work. I would like to thank everyone in this House for the way  they  spoke.
I would have spoken loudly, but my voice  is  faint  and  it  is  not  good.
[Applause.]]
Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Chairperson, this House will ...

An HON MEMBER: Is this your maiden speech?

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: ... agree with the Minister when she  said  in  her  speech
two days  ago  that  thousands  of  stokvels  and  societies  exist  in  our
communities which are proof that our people are saving in an  organised  and
disciplined fashion. The Minister is also correct when  she  refers  to  the
willingness of people ... if the hon member spent more  time  in  the  House
she would know that this is not my  maiden  speech.  The  Minister  is  also
correct when she refers to the willingness of  people  to  contribute  their
own labour towards improving their housing.

In my own  province  of  Mpumalanga  I  was  struck  by  the  fortitude  and
determination of people to take charge of their own lives and rebuild  their
houses after the devastation caused by floods just over two years ago.

The DA believes that the R2 479 contribution from each and every  recipient,
as a condition to receiving a subsidy,  will  promote  a  greater  sense  of
ownership in every home owner and also combat dependency.

Careful regulations will need to be drawn up to  ensure  that  the  benefits
associated with the home  owners'  own  contributions  are  not  negated  by
issues such as substandard  building,  unnecessary  bureaucracy  and  timing
differences that may arise.

The DA also welcomes the increase in the housing  subsidy,  particularly  at
the lowest level, for those earning less  than  R1  500  income  per  month.
However, taking  into  account  both  inflation  and  the  weakness  of  our
currency, it does not appear that this increase is a material  one  in  real
terms.

Another question to be asked is whether the new  subsidy  is  sufficient  to
attract quality  builders  back  into  the  low-cost  housing  market.  Many
builders, and particularly suppliers, do not even bother to  submit  tenders
for low-cost housing contracts, because ``you get what you  paid  for''  and
their quality work and materials make them uncompetitive.

Recently I spoke to a major irrigation company who told me that  they  never
bother to  submit  tenders  for  low-cost  housing  as  competing  suppliers
included in their bill of materials much  cheaper,  substandard  pipes  that
would burst within four to five  years.  Instead  of  losing  out  on  every
tender, this company has now simply geared its  business  towards  replacing
this substandard piping on a regular basis.

I would like to take a closer look at some  aspects  of  the  National  Home
Builders Registration  Council  which  warrant  further  attention.  Perhaps
understandably, the NHBRC has always been a controversial institution and  a
great deal of intense debate took place before the NHBRC became a  statutory
body. Statistics supplied by the NHBRC to the KwaZulu-Natal Master  Builders
Association some four years ago indicated that  0,46%  -  or  one  house  in
every 217 - had genuine building problems that needed to be  addressed.  The
question that was asked at  the  time  was  whether  such  a  low  level  of
building faults justified the setting up  of  a  massive  bureaucratic  body
such as the NHBRC.

The KwaZulu-Natal Master Builders Association argued at the  time  that  the
1,3% NHBRC enrolment fee added significantly to the cost of an  average  20-
year bond and that the scheme, in effect, amounted to a transfer  of  wealth
from home owners to the banking industry.

The NHBRC financial statements for the  last  two  years  indicate  that  an
amount in excess of R263 million has been collected  by  the  NHBRC,  almost
all of it in the form of enrolment and registration fees.  Of  this  amount,
R170 million has been absorbed by operating expenses - 64,6%  of  the  funds
collected. In 2002 alone,  total  operating  expenses  were  just  over  R63
million. Of this amount, only R1,134 million was spent  on  repairing  homes
with  building  problems.  The  equivalent  figures  for  2001  were  R1,506
million, out of total expenses of R75,990 million. In other words, out of  a
total of more than R229 million collected in the last  two  years,  just  R2
600 040 was needed to  effect  repairs  to  housing  -  1,1%  of  the  total
collected.

Figures  supplied  by  the  NHBRC  this  morning  indicate  that  there  are
currently approximately 166 000 houses enrolled under the NHBRC  scheme.  In
effect, this means that in the financial year  ending  31  March  2002,  the
total repairs effected by the NHBRC amounted to R6,83 per house enrolled.

In conclusion, I sincerely want to ask the Minister whether she is  prepared
to consider cheaper alternatives to the  NHBRC  or,  alternatively,  whether
the Minister considers it  justified  that  the  scheme  revert  back  to  a
voluntary basis.

Mr G E NKWINTI (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, we welcome  the  opportunity  to
explain some things in addition to those that the  hon  Minister  has  done.
Because she has actually explained the situation concerning our province  so
well, I simply have to focus on a couple of things in order to add  to  what
she has said.

Firstly, to put this into  context,  in  the  2000-01  financial  year,  the
Eastern Cape spent 94% of their  budget.  Of  that  94%,  R114  million  was
invested in 23 787 serviced land sites.

The top structure cost of this is R291 million. Building the top  structures
on these 23 787 serviced land sites,  will  take  us  two  to  three  years,
starting from the previous financial year. We cannot, on this  earth,  build
23 787 houses in one year. That underspending  is  therefore  an  accounting
function because all of this money has been projectised.

Why is the Minister correct when she says some of  the  problems  relate  to
legal technicalities, conveyancing, weaknesses in municipalities and in  the
Deeds Office.  Firstly,  most  municipalities  did  not  have  institutional
mechanisms to undertake housing development on a massive scale. We  are  now
aggressively addressing this with municipalities.

Secondly, the Eastern Cape is serviced by the Deeds  Office  in  Cape  Town.
The Western Cape government took a  political  decision,  somewhere  in  the
middle 1990s, to use only Act 112 and Act 113 of 1991, not  the  Development
Facilitation Act. The result is that the Deeds Office in Cape Town does  not
prioritise Development Facilitation Act applications - that  is  from  them,
not from me - and these are the applications  that  come  from  the  Eastern
Cape. To process subsidy applications at  the  Deeds  Office  in  Cape  Town
takes six to eight weeks. With regard  to  conveyancing,  which  is  another
factor mentioned by the Minister, a conveyancer in  the  Eastern  Cape  must
have a correspondent in Cape Town who must handle his or  her  applications.
Anything done incorrectly will have to be  returned  to  the  Eastern  Cape.
Sadly, some  conveyancers  either  do  not  have  the  capacity  -  we  have
experienced this - or do not prioritise these applications because they  are
not paying. They share between the Eastern Cape and Cape Town.

With regard to the fourth point which the Minister mentioned, the impact  of
section 118 of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, I can  only  say
that about 70% of the land stock of 23 787 serviced  sites  in  the  Eastern
Cape  are  in  the  Bhofolo  city  municipality  and  the   Nelson   Mandela
metropolitan municipality. Both these municipalities refused,  particularly,
to  facilitate  transfer  of  ownership  registration  in  line   with   the
explanations given by the Minister.

With the assistance of the  Minister  once  more,  the  situation  has  been
turned around. Suddenly these municipalities are back on board and  actually
leading the pack in terms of converting the serviced  land  stock  into  top
structures.

What does this mean for the rapid construction of houses? It means  that  in
every financial year, at least three months are  wasted  between  Bisho  and
Cape Town. What is the flip side of that? It takes only one or two  days  to
resolve any problem that we have with the Deeds Offices in Umtata  and  King
William's Town. Sadly, these two Deeds Offices do not handle even a  quarter
of our applications. The bulk of our applications are handled in Cape  Town.
But we are doing something about it.

We are aggressively building capacity in municipalities so  that  they  have
institutional capacity to  handle  housing  development.  We  are  literally
mentoring some of the conveyancers in the province. I am not  trying  to  be
insulting to lawyers, but this is  the  case.  We  have  engaged  the  Deeds
Office in Cape Town. We met with them. We were  surprised  when  they  said:
``When was this law passed, by the way? We do not even understand what  this
law is for. There are other instruments.'' This is not a joke. It  was  said
at a meeting that we held with them after we made a complaint. The  Minister
for Agriculture and Land Affairs drew their attention to it  and  sent  them
to us to discuss this matter. We made an offer and agreed with them that  we
would send our own staff to Cape Town, if needs be, to assist in  processing
these applications based on the Development Facilitation Act. They  promised
to create a dedicated unit in the Deeds Office in Cape  Town  to  deal  with
DFA applications from the Eastern Cape.

We are, nevertheless, rapidly converting the 23 787 serviced sites into  top
structures.  We  are  saying,  therefore  that  we  are  on  course  towards
overcoming these obstacles. We are steadily on course as well  as  providing
our people with the kind of house that the Minister referred to as decent.

There is  already  strong  evidence  on  the  ground  in  the  province.  We
therefore support the budget of the Minister. [Applause.]

Ms I L GCABASHE (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, I must assure you that I am  a
real  ``she''  although  referred  to  on  the  speakers'  list  as  ``Mr''.
[Laughter.]

Today's budget presented by the Minister bears a  call  for  our  people  to
play a meaningful role in housing themselves. Guiding us in  our  effort  to
fulfil our constitutional mandate of  providing  adequate  shelter  for  our
people are the vision and mission of our provincial department.

The mission states, among other things, that our task is to effectively  and
efficiently manage the implementation of  national  and  provincial  housing
programmes in partnership with the  relevant  role-players  and  to  provide
adequate, affordable and sustainable  shelter  for  qualifying  citizens  in
KwaZulu-Natal.  In  line  with  our  mission,  our  province   has   adopted
programmes as  the  key  priorities  of  the  department.  These  are  slums
clearance, the finalisation of existing projects, hostel redevelopment,  the
development of new urban housing, special projects, the finalisation of  old
businesses,  the  implementation  of  capacity-building  programmes,   rural
housing and the creation of rental housing stock.

Judging our priority programmes for the 2003-03 financial year, it is  clear
that we are still in line  with  our  promise  to  provide  housing  to  the
poorest of the poor. However, we believe that  our  people  cannot  sit  and
wait for hand-outs from Government. That is why we say: ``Phezu  komkhono''.
[Now is the time to work.]

With regard to rental stock, for the current financial  year,  we  have  put
the emphasis on the creation of rental stock. This  is  the  area  where  we
feel that  we  have  been  lagging  behind.  The  starter-housing  programme
benefits mostly the low-income group. This means that middle-income  earners
have been somewhat overlooked. They are not good enough  for  the  banks  to
extend credit to  build  houses,  and  they  earn  slightly  more  than  the
criteria for qualifying for a housing subsidy. They have become  victims  of
their circumstances. This form of accommodation has proven a  hit  with  our
middle-income earners in a project called Shayamoya Cato Manor in Durban.

The other reason we are pursuing this line is the fact  that  we  understand
that not everybody wants a free-standing house. Some people, mainly  because
of work commitments and marital status, cannot  afford  to  put  up  at  one
place for their rest of their lives. While  they  are  searching  for  their
roots or working, we believe that they should also be housed. This is a  new
concept, and, as such, we understand  that  it  will  not  be  an  overnight
success but a process. We will need to buy in municipalities  who  will  run
with projects after construction.
Esikhathini   esiphambili    izindawo    zasemakhya    bezisalele    ngemuva
ekuthuthukisweni kwezezindlu. Yilesi sizathu-ke esethu isifunda senze  ukuba
uhlelo lokwakhiwa kwezezindlu  emakhaya  lube  ngolubalulekile  ezinhlelweni
zethu.

Yize  zikhona  izinkinga  ngobunikazi  bomhlaba  kodwa  impumelelo   ikhona.
Ingxenye  yamakhosi  anelungelo  lokuphathwa  kwemihlaba   ezindaweni   zawo
ikujabulela  kakhulu   ukuza   kwentuthuko   yezezindlu   ezindaweni   zayo.
Ngingayibalula  eyodwa  lapho  uhlelo  seluqalile  khona.  INkosi   uKubheka
endaweni yakwaKhathide eNyukhasela ithole  izigidi  ezingu-R36,8  okuzophuma
kuwo izindlu eziyizinkulungwane ezimbili. (Translation  of  Zulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[In the past rural areas were left behind as far as housing development  was
concerned. It is  for  this  reason  that  our  province  has  regarded  the
programme for the building  of  houses  in  the  rural  areas  as  the  most
important of all our programmes.

Although there  are  problems  with  regard  to  land  ownership,  there  is
success. Some amakhosi who have land ownership rights in  their  areas  have
applauded the coming of housing development programmes  to  their  areas.  I
can mention one inkosi in an area where this  programme  has  been  started.
Inkosi Kubheka in the Khathide area, Newcastle, has received R36,8  million,
with which 2 000 houses will be built.]

As a province, we welcome the increase in the subsidy as  it  will  keep  up
with the rate of inflation. We encourage our  people  to  house  themselves,
and we have decided that those who earn R1 500 per month and below  and  are
not participating in the building  of  their  houses  through  the  People's
Housing Process will be required to contribute  R2  479  upfront  to  obtain
access to the subsidy of R20 300.

Lastly, we appreciate  the  allocation  to  our  province  for  the  current
financial year and we support the budget. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam Chair, hon Minister and hon members  of  this  House,
of all the material things that a person needs for his or for her  survival,
a house of whatever nature is the most important necessity. It is  not  only
necessary  for  him  or  herself,  but  most  importantly  for  his  or  her
offspring.

Although my intention is not to scrape the healing wounds  of  the  past,  I
only need  to  say  that  the  provision  of  housing  is  being  vigorously
addressed, more than ever before. It is also gratifying to note  that  there
is a vigorous focus on quality, rather than on  the  former  quantity-driven
focus.

The quality of the product is of inestimable value. It enhances the  dignity
and self-respect of the owner. It is my firm belief that as more  houses  of
quality standard are built for our people who  are,  in  fact,  our  support
base, their dignity and self-respect will be restored.

The latest surveys indicate that houses built by the people  themselves  are
of better quality and are more spacious than  those  built  by  contractors,
who often aim at amassing as much money as possible  and  doing  so  at  the
expense of our countrymen. However, it is noted  with  appreciation  that  a
special investigative unit has been set up  to  investigate  allegations  of
maladministration,  irregularities,  fraud  and   theft   related   to   the
implementation of the housing scheme.

I am not at this stage aware  of  whether  or  not  the  unit  is  achieving
success in solving the  fraud  and  irregularities  and  also  of  what  has
happened to the contractors and individuals who have defrauded the scheme.

As I speak, there are media reports of cases  of  fraud  and  irregularities
related to the RDP houses in Vryburg. However, I  cannot  elaborate  further
as I have not been able to verify the extent of the damage  done  there.  It
is noted that within the housing budget itself, housing development  funding
consumes the largest slice at approximately  88,8%  of  the  overall  budget
expenditure of the department. The UCDP supports the Vote.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr J MASWANGANYI (Northern Province): Chairperson, Minister,  MECs,  members
of the House, I want to take this opportunity to  commend  the  Minister  on
his budget speech. Since 1994 the Limpopo  province  has  been  implementing
various housing programmes in line with our  Constitution  and  the  overall
housing policy framework. In doing so, we have  managed  to  date  to  build
more than 115 500 houses for the needy, amounting to R1,3 billion.

By 1 March 2002 the budget of R334 million was utilised for 25  000  houses,
built without any roll-overs. By 31 March we recorded  100%  expenditure  in
the Limpopo province, and we have  blacklisted  developers  who  constructed
poor quality houses, in terms of the Minmec decision.

These programmes had a multiplier effect in terms  of  employment.  We  have
managed to create two permanent jobs within each housing project,  and  more
than 15 project-based jobs for skilled and unskilled labour.

We have also contributed significantly towards promoting women,  the  youth,
the disabled, developers and contractors. For the  financial  year  2002-03,
the department has allocated 1 708 units to the  disabled  developers  at  a
cost of R34,672 million. We have allocated 2 844 units to  women  developers
in terms of the Minmec decision, which is that 10% of the budget  should  be
allocated to women  developers,  the  majority  of  whom  are  blacks.  This
amounts to R57,7 million. To the youth developers we have  allocated  4  344
units or houses, amounting to R88,1 million.

It is  a  fallacy  that  previously  disadvantaged  developers  or  emerging
developers  cannot  deliver.  As  the  province  we  have  capacity-building
programmes for emerging developers. We have also  increased  the  number  of
staff, in particular inspectors. They prefer to be called project managers.

Beyond empowering the designated groups,  this  allocation  is  directed  at
completing outstanding projects  and  addressing  the  historical  backlogs.
Good news for the beneficiaries in the province is that this  year  we  have
increased the housing size from 40 square metres to 45 square  metres,  with
a foundation deeper than 300 cm.

One of our policy imperatives for this financial year is to  complete  flood
disaster housing under the rural housing  subsidy  scheme.  This  will  also
assist in the provision and upgrading of rural infrastructure. In line  with
our rural development strategy, we are building houses on existing sites  in
R188 villages, that is, in rural areas.

We fully support the new policy directives, which require  beneficiaries  to
make a contribution of R2 400 towards the building of their houses. We  also
fully embrace the policy directive that beneficiaries who  cannot  afford  a
specific amount must contribute sweat equity, that  is,  beneficiaries  must
contribute towards labour in the construction of their houses.

In line with the Department of Housing, the Public  Service  Commission  and
monitoring evaluation practices, to ensure  policy  adherence  and  quality,
the department has taken a decision to launch a detailed investigation  into
the implementation of the housing subsidy scheme.

The HIV/Aids impact and policy provision, particularly for  orphans,  gender
equity, land availability, and rising land costs and contested  land  rights
are amongst other key policy questions which require our  collective  wisdom
in our endeavour to improve the lives of the poor. Let  me  convey  to  this
House that the rural poor appreciates the Government's delivery of houses.

We want to thank the hon the  Minister  for  providing  decisive  leadership
and,  as  the  Limpopo  province,  we  support  the  Housing  Budget   Vote.
[Applause.]

Mnu P P DYONASE (IPhondo lasemNtla-Ntshona): Mhlalingaphambili,  mandixolise
kuqala ngenxa yokuba ilungu elihloniphekileyo uQabane Daki  akaphumelelanga,
nguye obemele kukuba lapha. Nangona kunjalo, liza  kuqhubela  phambili  lona
iphondo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)
[Mr P P DYONASE (North  West):  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  render  an
apology for the hon Daki who could not attend, although he is  the  one  who
is supposed to be making the presentation here. The province, however,  will
proceed.]

The input of the province is going to be based upon what we have been  given
by your House, Chairperson, on 10 points. What  we  have  done  is  only  to
record the challenges that are facing our province, and I am sure  that  all
the provinces face these challenges.

In the North West, historic population growth rates  indicate  that  20  222
additional  families  enter  the  North  West  housing  market  each   year.
Approximately 16 000 of these households are eligible for housing  subsidies
and reside in structures that do not meet  the  minimum  housing  norms  and
standards.

It is evident from the needs and challenges of  housing  and  infrastructure
delivery that much remains to be done to ensure equitable,  sustainable  and
integrated human settlement development throughout  the  province  of  North
West. Housing delivery figures show that more than 16 000 houses  were,  for
the first time, delivered in North West during 2001-02.

Mhlalingaphambili,   siyayixhasa   intetho    yolwabiwo-mali    yoMphathiswa
wezeZindlu. [Chairperson, we support the Budget  Vote  of  the  Minister  of
Housing.]

I would like to go through these points that I have  already  spoken  about.
The first one is  national  housing  policy  and  strategy.  These  are  the
challenges that the  province  is  facing.  To  communicate  effectively,  a
strategy is needed to disseminate new housing policies to  communities.  All
the policies that are coming must not only just stay there  in  the  office,
but must go the people. That is the challenge that is  facing  us  in  North
West. We have those ward committees and ward councillors who  need  training
to understand all these processes.

Secondly, as far as  human  settlement  policy  is  concerned,  one  of  the
challenges that we are experiencing is that some project proposals  are  not
forthcoming from municipalities, and then  they  need  to  be  aligned  with
integrated development plans. The critical one is that the  broad  programme
should be integrated with the Department of Water Affairs and  Forestry,  to
assist the municipalities in addressing  the  bucket  system.  That  is  the
problem that we have. We tried to obtain the  funds  in  the  province,  but
nobody puts anything there for us. We are saying that  this  is  a  critical
issue that needs to  be  dealt  with,  particularly  in  the  so-called  old
townships.

With regard to the housing subsidy scheme, the challenge is that so  far  no
mechanism  is  in  place  for  municipalities  to  collect  the  beneficiary
contributions of R2 479. These are the things that we  are  grappling  with.
The issue of selling the RDP houses remains a problem in my province.  There
are criminals who say that they are going to put  people  in  those  houses.
Instead of putting the beneficiaries in there, they put  in  people  who  do
not even belong in those houses. Those are  the  criminals  we  are  dealing
with. They need to be arrested and we must make sure that the law takes  its
course.

As far as the issue of capacity-building is concerned, so far we  are  being
assisted by Wits University regarding some of the courses that we think  are
good for municipal staff members and officials. We also  have  an  agreement
with  Potchefstroom  University.  Another  area  with  regard  to  capacity-
building is that there is no targeted capacity-building.  Municipalities  do
not necessarily send housing practitioners to do courses. Sometimes  sending
a person who does not really deal with  issues  of  housing  itself  becomes
another problem.

With regard to the People's Housing Process projects, I  will  only  mention
three, although I have a lot on my  list.  There  is  a  need  to  establish
support  centres  in  each  municipality.  Training  is  needed  for  people
completing application forms  as  they  are  always  incorrectly  completed.
Forms which are not completed cannot be considered  by  the  department.  We
need somebody who is well trained to do all these  things.  The  release  of
the establishment grant is always delayed  by  the  bureaucratic  processes.
These are the challenges that we are facing.

As far as sustainable integrated development is  concerned,  we  are  saying
that  the  challenge  that  we  face  is  the  poor  response   from   other
departments, for example, clinics, schools and sportsfields not being  built
when houses are built. Along the roads one will see  all  these  small  kids
hitch-hiking to get to school some kilometres  away.  We  have  built  these
houses, but there are no schools, sportsgrounds and clinics. These  are  the
challenges  that  we  are  facing  in  the  province.  In  relation  to  the
integration of housing and  other  developments  with  municipal  integrated
development planning processes.

Regarding the rural housing strategy, the challenge that we  are  facing  is
to find an equitable balance between rural  and  urban  housing  development
needs. We are also experiencing a land  availability  problem  and  lack  of
support for some traditional authorities. There is a  need  to  explore  the
possibilities of individual subsidies in rural areas to address the  request
by employers who are willing to assist their  employees  to  get  houses  in
those rural areas. There are employers who want to assist those workers.

Regarding hostel redevelopment, the challenge we are facing is that  of  the
illegal occupation which is taking place, the nonpayment  of  rent  and  for
services, and the provision of basic services. For instance, sanitation  and
water are neglected by some of the municipalities,  but  not  all  of  them.
There is  the  high  unemployment  rate  that  influences  the  payment  for
services.

As far as urban renewal is concerned, there  is  a  need  to  promote  high-
density social housing options and the ideal of  compact  cities  and  towns
vis-à-vis the urban sprawl.  There  is  the  problem  of  bridging  the  gap
between the apartheid city or town  and  the  townships  on  the  periphery.
Integrated development plans should address this  gap  through  the  spatial
development framework.

The last challenge is the problem of redlining  by  banks.  This  remains  a
problem where beneficiaries were also excluded from  the  Servcon-Thubelisha
rightsizing programme. I think that there is a cut-off date  that  is  still
hanging over us, in that those who were retrenched or could  not  pay  by  a
particular date could not be assisted. Only those who  were  affected  after
that date could be assisted. I think that is the  biggest  problem  that  we
are facing, particularly next to the mining industry.

These are some of the challenges that we thought that,  as  North  West,  we
must share with our colleagues  here.  We  are  addressing  them.  There  is
progress in the platinum province, and I would like  to  tell  the  hon  the
Minister that ...

Into oyenzayo siyayibona phaya, kwaye  siyiqhwabela  izandla.  Siya  hambili
njengamany'amaphondo. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [We can see what the hon  the  Minister
of Housing is doing out there and we applaud  it.  We  are  proceeding  just
like other provinces.] [Applause.]]

Ms N E HANGANA (Western Cape): Chairperson, Comrade  Minister,  hon  members
of the Council, today marks my maiden speech in the NCOP, but I  can  assure
the Council that it will be hearing a lot from me. From  the  second  debate
and in future there will be vibrant debate coming from this side.

I rise in support of this Budget Vote. When I move around the areas of  Cape
Town, I see people exclaiming that this Government  has  given  them  houses
for the very first time in their lives. In the same areas of Cape  Town  one
finds people crying and screaming because of their homelessness.

Yesterday, for the first time in my term as MEC, there was a  big  march  to
the National Assembly, with my name on some of the  placards.  I  was  saved
from a difficult situation by Mandla in the Minister's office.  He  assisted
me. Those things are part of our struggles. [Interjections.]
It was a hot reception, but it is part  of  our  ongoing  struggle  to  give
shelter to our people. We do not shy away from that  struggle.  Hon  members
will see housing developments taking place all over the  Western  Cape,  but
they will also find that there are a lot of  informal  settlements  if  they
drive along the N2, especially where the poorest of the poor live.

This contradictory situation seeks to convey a  particular  message  to  all
those involved in housing. That message is  that  our  progressive  policies
have positively impacted on our people's lives, but  also  that  it  is  not
enough. There are still many challenges ahead of us.

May I share with hon members some of the achievements of my  department,  as
well as the challenges that it is facing. I would firstly like to deal  with
what hon member Majodina said about the underspending in the  Western  Cape.
It was disclosed to me at my first Minmec meeting as MEC  that  the  Western
Cape in fact had underspent. I went back, frog-marched my department  and  I
said we needed to spend that  money.  I  told  them  we  did  not  want  any
applications lying there with dust on them. We  had  to  spend  that  money.
That money has been spent fully within  its  budget  year,  so  we  have  no
underspending at all. [Applause.]

Between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2002, a total of 22 307 housing  subsidies
were screened and approved. I want to believe that the pace at which we  are
moving is very fast. This is done in the spirit  and  context  of  complying
with the presidential call of speeding up delivery.

With the subsidy having  been  increased  to  R22  300,  we  are  even  more
optimistic that we will have the  capital  muscle  to  better  our  people's
lives. This means that we will have more money for the top structure,  which
will result in a bigger end product. I  once  again  humbly  appeal  to  the
construction  industry   to   adhere   to   the   building   standards   and
specifications outlined in the national housing code.

A total of 28 People's Housing Process projects, with  a  subsidy  value  of
over R74 million, have been approved. From this we are  looking  forward  to
building 7 861 houses. I personally consider this  process  to  be  the  one
that puts democracy in practice, because it makes sure that  the  government
policies are people and needs-driven. As such my  department  will  continue
to support the PHP projects.

I am, however, concerned that there are  elements  that  are  hijacking  the
People's Housing Process for the benefit of their own  pockets.  This  is  a
people-driven process, and no one should be allowed to interfere with it.  I
will personally see to it that the PHP operates as smoothly as  intended  by
the department. I have already instructed my directorates to  come  up  with
preventative measures in respect of these concerns.

To show my undying commitment  to  the  People's  Housing  Process,  I  have
instructed the head of department to increase the  staff  component  on  the
PHP sections so that it meets the demand. The head of department has  issued
permission for contract appointments in the interim.

Among the successful projects that we have is the, Integrated Serviced  Land
Project or  ISLP.  This  is  the  most  outstanding  integrated  development
project in the entire country ever. In  the  Western  Cape  it  operates  in
areas like Langa, Delft, the N2 highway and Vanguard Drive.  It  has  helped
build over 22 500 houses, it has serviced  sites,  upgraded  schools,  built
community  halls,  helped  with  capacity-building,  as  well  as   promoted
economic development initiatives.

I am happy also to report that the  Western  Cape  government  has  extended
this programme of the ISLP's operational lifespan by  another  three  years,
as from 1 April this year. As a result of this project, more and more  women
are  beginning  to  infiltrate,  with  excellence,  the  domain   that   was
incorrectly perceived to be male-dominated. But, in  general,  the  majority
of our beneficiaries are women.

In order to cope with a natural disaster, an amount  of  R2,79  million  has
been granted for the Flood Relief Programme. I am also pleased  to  announce
to hon members that the unicity has already made some tremendous strides  in
this regard. At Mfuleni about 4  236  sites  are  being  serviced  by  civil
contractors.  [Interjections.]  Of  those  sites,  about  2  713  have  been
approved  by  the  Housing  Board  as  managed  land  settlements.  The  top
structure is soon to follow.

The municipalities have already received a provisional  budget,  which  will
be utilised as soon as they come with their business plans, outlining  their
priorities. We would  appreciate  it  if  municipalities  could  assist  the
department in prioritising housing needs in their respective areas,  because
we do not want municipalities to come back to the department  and  say  that
it is the provincial housing department that has  approved  these  projects.
We want municipalities themselves to say what their priorities are, so  that
we as a province can follow those priorities.

Spending my entire housing budget is all I  intend  to  do  to  improve  the
quality of homes for the poor. [Interjections.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: [Inaudible.]

Ms N E HANGANA: In my second round I am coming for you. [Laughter.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: I am not scared of you.

Ms N E HANGANA: My department has done a lot to improve the quality  of  the
information dissemination  process.  [Interjections.]  A  housing  desk  was
established to  assist  with  the  answering  of  all  matters  relating  to
housing. A month ago a provincial housing conference  was  held  between  25
and 27 March. It was an outstanding conference and  the  first  one  of  its
kind in the country. It was attended by high-ranking delegated speakers.

A series of workshops preceded  the  conference  to  inform  all  the  role-
players in housing of the provincial housing  plan,  rental  tribunal,  land
management and policy amendments. To enhance the housing  delivery  process,
the capacity-building programme has been operating for the past four  years.
During the past year, about 160 candidates,  consisting  of  provincial  and
local government housing officials and councillors, attended  these  courses
in George.

The upgrading of the informal settlements is deemed the  viable  option,  as
opposed to resettling families, and  thus  destroying  the  social  networks
they have already forged over the years. In situ upgrading must,  therefore,
be vigorously pursued. In compliance with the Rental Housing Act of 1999,  a
provincial rental housing tribunal was established in July 2001,  which  was
articulated here by the member of the ACDP. [Interjections.] Can you  please
protect me from this speaker who is out of order? [Interjections.]

I am pleased to announce that the tribunal has already dealt with  a  number
of formal hearings. [Interjections.] The Western  Cape  rental  tribunal  is
the only tribunal in the entire country that has so far dealt with  disputes
through formal hearings. [Interjections.] The tribunal's  operation  is  not
only confined to the metropole, but it also  deals  with  complaints  within
and outside the boundaries of the Western Cape.

In response to both national and humanitarian calls  against  HIV/Aids,  the
Chief Directorate of Housing has already acknowledged  the  plight  of  Aids
sufferers, who are in most cases reduced to  being  street  dwellers,  after
having been excommunicated by their families and friends. For  this  reason,
we have already sold two hectares of land in Philippi for  only  R10  to  an
organisation that will build an Aids care centre. [Interjections.]

The centre will be run  by  Beautiful  Gate  Ministries,  and  will  provide
service to Aids orphans and those suffering from the virus.  In  partnership
with our sister department and the private sector, the chief directorate  is
in the process  of  investigating  alternative  ways  of  accommodating  the
people rendered homeless by HIV/Aids. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Mr V V  Z  WINDVOëL:  Sihlalo,  uMhlon,  nani  bekunene,  [Chairperson,  hon
Minister, hon members,] the national Minister  has  spoken,  six  MECs  have
spoken, and the  chairperson  has  eloquently  put  our  position  and  more
importantly, she has done so in her mother tongue. [Interjections.]

As I sat here, I ticked off  some  of  the  other  points  which  they  were
speaking about. I was left with about 18% that had  not  been  mentioned.  I
consciously asked myself whether it would be wise to continue  with  my  10-
page speech merely to give another version of what has  been  said  already.
[Laughter.] The MECs who spoke were from the ANC. The  Minister,  who  spoke
in a very informative and educative way, is also from the ANC,  and  we  are
left with  nothing  else  but  to  conclude  that  the  ANC  is  taking  the
absolutely correct direction in regard to housing people. [Applause.]

Housing remains one of our key post-apartheid challenges.  If  Mrs  Versfeld
listened attentively, she would  have  agreed  with  me  that  the  previous
regime, with which her party also shared seats in that parliament, left  our
people homeless and destitute. [Interjections.] I was very taken by what  Mr
Tlhagale was saying. He stopped  just  short  of  saying  that  his  leader,
Mangope, had not done anything in this regard.  [Laughter.]  The  same  goes
for Mr Nyakane, who was so very positive.  [Laughter.]  His  leader  in  the
Transkei could also have done much more, but missed the opportunity.

I will therefore not proceed with my speech, save to say that we  thank  the
department very much. What the Minister said  really  did  show  vision  and
indicated where South Africa  is  going  in  terms  of  housing  people  and
restoring their dignity.

We must also thank the director-general  of  the  department  for  the  very
informative briefing which we were given at our  select  committee  meeting.
It shows that she knows her story and has everything at her fingertips.

I will leave it to the Minister to respond to some of the noises which  were
supposed  to  be  a  maiden  speech  by  the   hon   Krumbock.   [Laughter.]
[Interjections.] In my analysis I could not detect any  political  substance
and I was only left with the conclusion that he was just representing  those
monopolies,  the  building   and   construction   companies,   rather   than
representing the interests of the homeless and destitute people. However,  I
will not blame the member much because it is his party that has deployed  an
administrator to be a politician. That person will become  bored,  and  that
is why the member was speaking about R6,83 and other things, and maybe  that
is also why he does not spend much time sitting in this House. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Chairperson, I would like to  thank  the  MECs  who
are present here today and the special delegates for  making  time  to  come
and share whatever they have with us. A special welcome to our new  MEC,  Ms
Hangana, who was the chairperson of our portfolio committee in the  National
Assembly. The member is welcome and  will  fight  the  battle  from  another
angle.

I also want to thank my team, which has always  been  available  to  do  the
work that is required of all of  us  and  also  to  give  me  the  necessary
support. There is a member of the team here, Mr Frik Barnard, for whom I  am
told, this is possibly the last meeting and contact with  this  environment,
because he is going on pension. [Applause.] But he tells  me  that  he  will
continue somewhere else to do the professional and technical  work  that  he
has been doing. We wish him well.

Let me respond first to the issue of integration,  which  has  emerged  from
most of the speakers from all sides. It is an issue that I think  Government
is seized with. I think we are making progress in that  direction.  We  also
have to be aware of the fact that integrated  development  also  requires  a
high degree of co-ordination and co-operation at all  levels,  transversally
and horizontally. There is no point in national government having  the  kind
of integration we have if, when one goes to  the  provinces  and  the  local
authorities, one finds that they do not  have  it.  It  means  that  we  are
failing because there is a chain that has to be linked to the grass roots.

But we also have to realise that we have inherited a fragmented system,  and
we are still trying to unlock it and improve where we  can,  which  is  near
impossible because what has been left on  the  ground  spatially  cannot  be
gotten rid of. All we can do, through our policy, is  to  have  a  different
kind of approach that is integrated and  will  facilitate  the  building  of
communities and bridge the gap between those who were  divided  by  railway,
school, street or open space. It is all we can do for now  with  the  little
available land that we can lay our hands on.

It is obvious that we have inherited a dysfunctional  system,  but  we  also
have to make sure that when we apply our IDPs, our planning at  all  levels,
it should also incorporate investment in  housing,  so  that  we  create  an
asset on the ground that, at the same time, changes the environment for  the
better for our beneficiaries. We should  not  just  put  that  little  house
there. It must transform into something else  and  our  policy  has  started
doing that.

We have provided  secure  tenure.  We  have  provided  basic  services  with
integrated  budgeting  from  the  different   departments.   I   am   saying
``integrated''  despite  the  fact  that  we  still  deliver   as   separate
departments, but our work and budgets meet on the  ground,  particularly  in
housing.

We have the bulk infrastructure invested through  the  Department  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry, the Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government
through the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme  and  sanitation
through the Department of Water Affairs.  At  the  same  time,  through  our
housing policy we also internally,  within  the  parameters  of  the  house,
provide electricity, the connection of the internal  water  system  and  the
piping and sanitation, so we just need to integrate those  budgets.  I  also
think that what Government is doing at national level hopefully is going  to
transmit and transfer to  the  other  structures.  We  are  now  working  as
clusters. We are already attending to some of the problems  that  have  been
referred to in this House as cluster members.

I  received  the  letter  from  the  delegate  from  the  Eastern  Cape  and
transferred  it  to  the  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  to
facilitate the application  for  land  to  be  transferred  for  development
purposes, since that power lies with Land Affairs. We have tried to  do  the
same in  some  cases  with  applications  from  the  Northern  Province  and
Mpumalanga working as team. Actually  it  does  speed  up  the  process  and
accelerate delivery, so we will continue doing that, but we also have to  be
aware of the fact that some cases have  already  been  approached  from  the
integrated position of trying to see what is going to happen if  governments
begin to work together. We have Tsutsumani in Alexandra. That  involved  the
Department of Housing, the Department of Provincial  and  Local  Government,
the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and   Forestry,   the   Department   of
Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  and  the  Department  of   Sport   and
Recreation.

When we deliver our greening programme, namely ``one house, one  tree'',  we
have linked that effort between Housing,  Environmental  Affairs  and  Water
Affairs. Even if it is minimal, it is beginning to work. Whilst  looking  at
the lack of integration, we  need  to  keep  in  mind  that  Government  has
already had an impact in terms of trying to find a way of making  sure  that
we work in an integrated manner.

Last week in our housing awards, what we were trying to  promote  there  was
to emulate  those  municipalities  that  have  attempted  also  to  have  an
integrated approach to their development. The Bester project in  Durban  was
awarded the trophy for making sure that they had an integrated approach.  It
is houses, a clinic, roads and a school and that is the road  that  we  want
to travel.

The social housing projects in Gauteng and especially the Newtown  precinct,
when we look at  that  whole  precinct,  represent  an  integrated  kind  of
approach. The Housing Association of East London has tried to come  up  with
that approach. They have instituted the initial investment into that  and  I
am told that the rest of the development will follow. The Vanderley  project
in East London well reflects an integrated approach.

The Jobs Summit projects that we are  funding  through  the  Poverty  Relief
Fund and some of our subsidies  are  integrated  approaches.  We  should  be
confident that Government is really making a huge attempt to make sure  that
we have our integrated approach worked into our system and then absorbed  by
those who have been given the task and the mandate to do exactly that.

Our urban renewal projects are  tackled  not  at  sectoral  departments  and
units. We are working together as clusters. We have  the  rural  development
cluster convened by the Minister for Provincial  and  Local  Government.  We
are going into  this  rural  node,  for  example,  to  look  at  aspects  of
development and to agree on how we are going  to  co-ordinate  our  work  in
those provinces. Let me take, for example, the Kgalagadi in the North  West.
We moved in there as this cluster but our first  project  as  a  cluster  is
going to be to promote economic activity in  that  area.  We  are  going  to
promote a project there. As Minister of Housing I am involved  in  nurturing
goats, because at the end of the day we  have  people  in  houses  who  need
employment. That is just an example of what we are trying to do.

With regard to urban renewal  programmes  such  as  Alexandra  we  spent  R3
million and there have been  two  other  successive  budget  allocations  to
reviving the area. The Departments of Provincial and Local Government,  Land
Affairs and Health have all come in and we are looking at  our  budgets  and
making sure there is money where there are  these  gaps.  We  need  to  fill
those gaps. I would like to encourage our  provincial  authorities  to  make
sure that these projects are supported on the ground.

We also have to acknowledge the fact that there is  now  better  interaction
between the national department and the  provinces.  I  think  our  work  is
being integrated for the mere fact that there is  better  co-ordination.  We
talk more regularly than we  used  to  do.  We  are  making  sure  that  the
problems being experienced  on  the  ground  are  transferred,  even  it  is
technically to the department. Our department has a team that  goes  out  to
make sure that we bridge the gap between the national and the provincial.

In the case of underexpenditure, our team has been in the province for  some
time to try and find out why the monthly reports that were  coming  in  were
indicating,  even  very  early   in   the   year,   that   we   might   have
underexpenditure. We started dealing with those problems. It does  not  come
as a surprise, because the linkages are there and the systems are  beginning
to work. I would like to confirm what the MECs have said here. We are  going
to solve the problem of underexpenditure. We can do very little  about  most
of the reasons that  have  been  stated  here  with  regard  to  floods  and
emergencies. We can only act afterwards. We can only build when there is  no
rain. It is not an excuse. It is reality.

There are also other problems that  are  not  of  our  own  making.  We  are
spending our capacity-building item in the budget.  We  have  been  spending
since as early as 1996, when we started capacity-building. What  happens  is
that when people acquire experience, they go away to the private sector.  We
have given them the knowledge. Once they  have  that  knowledge  base,  they
benefit from the private sector. There is very little we can do. All we  can
do is to continue to ask our people to think again about the money  we  used
for empowering them and building their  knowledge  bases.  We  would  really
appreciate it if they would give a few of their years to the  Department  of
Housing. In that respect we will be announcing very soon the steps taken  to
try and make sure that we get that money back in some way.

I do not want to offend the hon Krumbock, so let me make sure  that  I  have
the correct name here. The National Home Builders  Registration  Council  is
an outcome which emerged out of the Housing  Consumers  Protection  Measures
Act, as a statutory  body  that  was  going  to  assist  to  administer  the
warranty scheme and the registration of home  builders.  We  predicted  that
there was going to be a 0,4% defect ratio and we calculated  that  based  on
what we were doing in terms of our budget and in terms of what was  emerging
on the ground.

We were also aware of  the  fact  that  we  needed  a  fund  that  would  be
sustainable, but at the same time we had to ensure that it would be  viable.
In drafting the legislation we considered that there  might  be  more  money
available than was projected,  the  1,3%  requested  from  developers  as  a
registration fee. We did project that we might have  some  surplus  in  this
investment. We were also quite aware of the fact that we still  had  a  very
huge backlog and we needed to make sure that we  monitored  each  and  every
product that we put on the ground.

If we go back to what the registration council has been doing, we have  been
concentrating on the higher output group, from R1 501 up to the lowermiddle-
income group. We looked at that scale to see what kinds of products we  were
getting and also to give the registration council an opportunity to  set  up
institutional  capacity  on  the  ground.  We  are  going  to  extend   that
responsibility to cover RDP products. The  reasons  are  the  following:  We
want  to  introduce  into  the  environment  good-quality   developers   and
contractors. We want to give dignity to the industry. Secondly, we  want  to
make sure that Government gets value for its money. We must make  sure  that
we monitor the very products, the so-called RDP products. We  want  to  make
sure that we are not  getting  shoddy  stuff,  just  because  they  are  RDP
houses.

We are also aware of the fact that we are going to have a very great  impact
on the actuarial data necessary to determine either a deficit or  a  surplus
in the warranty fund. We can also only confirm that the status of the  fund,
after the subsidy market, will also allow us an opportunity  at  some  stage
to review. What is being commented on is a  temporary  affair.  We  are  not
covering the whole spectrum of the one million units. We are  covering  just
less than 14% and we need to cover the entire industry.

I just wanted to say that  the  comments  of  the  hon  Krumbock  should  be
subjected to the minimal amount  that  the  registration  council  has  been
monitoring.

As to the cost and size of  the  house,  I  thought  we  needed  to  give  a
breakdown of how we are going to spend this money that  we  have,  from  R16
000 to R20 300. What we have in mind is that we have estimated the  cost  of
land at about R332, which means that 1,6% of the  subsidy  will  go  to  the
land acquisition cost.

We are looking at the  direct  provision  of  services,  roads,  sanitation,
water reticulation, storm water, street piping, etc. That will  take  38,2%.
Professional fees will be 6,5%. In total  the  land  costs  will  amount  to
about R9 400 including all of these activities. The rest, which will be  R10
900, will go to the top structure.

I want to say that this is just a reflection, because if  we  encourage  our
people to go out and seek competitive prices we might be  able  to  maximise
the utilisation of the subsidy, as people have done in the People's  Housing
Process. When one goes to the People's Housing Process and looks at the  way
they have costed their expenditure it is  quite  obvious  that  people  have
gone out of their way to go to different  building  materials  suppliers  to
ask how much, for instance, a pipe a certain number of centimetres  long  to
connect the water supply will cost. They compare this among  suppliers,  and
because of those price comparisons, they have really  been  able  to  extend
the size of their houses because they make sure that they go  for  the  best
price.

I was told that in KwaZulu-Natal - I do not know if it still applies -  some
of the People's Housing Process entities have some  kind  of  contract  with
Corobrik that lets them buy bricks at a discount. That  is  another  element
which we need to build into the People's Housing Process, to  try  and  make
sure that our people begin to get into this construction in  a  businesslike
manner, so that we are not exploited by  building  materials  suppliers  who
might think that because we have increased the subsidy, they can push  their
prices up to unaffordable levels. We will  not  accept  that.  What  we  are
trying to explain here is that our subsidy does  not  just  go  to  the  top
structure; it also assists us to buy some of the other stuff that  we  need.
When we look at it, we should look at it in that way.

There has also been the issue of corruption. We  are  quite  aware  that  we
have miscreants in our communities, people who disregard  the  law  and  the
rules and dishonour the effort to reduce the  levels  of  poverty.  We  have
taken steps to address those kinds of issues. We have received reports  from
all provinces, even the Vryburg case that the hon member talked  about,  for
example, and we have submitted those complaints to the  task  team  that  we
have put into place, composed of auditors, investigators and  lawyers.  Very
soon arrests are going to be made. We did not just want  to  rush  into  the
issue, not knowing whether the complaints were administrative or  management
issues.  We  have  to  separate  administrative  shortfalls  and  management
weaknesses  from  outright  corruption  and  deal   with   the   individuals
accordingly.

They are going to be  doing  some  work  and  we  will  be  getting  reports
formally. We are supported in this instance by the  SAPS,  the  prosecutor's
office, that is Mr Ngcuka's office and the Scorpions and  we  are  going  to
have the special investigation team making sure  that  whoever  is  involved
gets the relevant information, including the  Office  for  Serious  Economic
Offences.

We are on track in terms of the work. We are doing the job and  we  will  be
able to expose the culprits. Of course, we do  have  the  consumer  measures
that are going to assist us to deal with the fly-by-nights, I  do  not  have
to go into those details.

Regarding the issues that have been raised by Mr Dyonase we are going to  be
talking to him about some of these issues. Some of them  are  already  being
taken care of. As for the savings that we have talked  about  and  requested
people to work towards, we have tried to find  a  formula  which  will  link
those savings to the national subsidy. We have also done a bit  of  work  by
looking at what other countries have done, particularly Chile, to see if  we
cannot link all of the available resources to the bank, the  department  and
the saver. If that does not work, we  will  still  be  able  to  proceed  as
partners, Government and the communities, because  we  also  have  to  build
into our approach the issue of disappointment as has happened in  the  past.
Whatever happens, it is going to be linked up.

At the same time we think when we are trying to  enforce  these  savings  we
should not be thinking about how on earth poor people are going  to  do  it.
Poor people have have actually taught  us  a  few  things.  Even  before  we
pronounced on this issue, they were saving  on  their  own.  The  federation
here in the Western Cape was doing so as early as  1996,  when  we  provided
the R10 million support to  the  People's  Housing  Process  that  had  been
identified by my predecessor. Already the federation  has  saved  more  than
R234 000. Those are  people  in  the  informal  sector,  some  of  whom  are
unemployed and contributed sweat equity.

So we should not patronise them. Our people are ready  to  work.  They  have
delivered more than 15 000 units without anybody pushing them. We  have  got
to respect them, otherwise we are going to be  taking  away  their  dignity.
They do not want to be fed like children.

On the issue of the eradication of informal settlements,  our  policies  are
already addressing that issue. We are engaged in in situ upgrading  and  the
relocation of people who  are  settled  on  land  that  is  not  necessarily
acceptable for human habitation. At the same time we are  beginning  to  say
we might not have available land next to  areas  of  economic  activity  and
that is why we are building upwards. Our rental policy  and  social  housing
are going to give us information on how we are going to  manage  this  phase
and the resources that we have, including management of  the  response  from
our beneficiaries. That is a subject outside of this debate because we  have
our social housing policy and Bill already on their way to  Cabinet,  so  we
will have an opportunity to have a detailed discussion on that matter.

Let me end by saying that we have  achieved  what  we  have  achieved  as  a
department because hon  members  have  co-operated.  Let  us  see  that  co-
operation continue and let us continue to  have  the  support  that  we  are
enjoying now. On our part, wherever possible, even if we do not have  enough
staff,  we  will  be  able  to  provide  hon  members  with  that   support.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.
