                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D C MABENA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the SAPS has reported a 36,3% decline in farm  attacks  in
       the Free State province;


  (2) recognises that this  Government  has  made  a  concerted  effort  to
       develop  and  implement  the  Rural  Safety  Plan  that  co-ordinates
       proactive and reactive measures to curb and address farm attacks;


  (3) welcomes this positive trend; and


  (4) commends the efforts  of  all  stakeholders  including  the  farmers,
       farmworkers and the Police Service for their efforts to eliminate the
       scourge of farm killings.

[Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  I  shall  move  as
follows:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was reported to the
       parliamentary Ethics Committee nine months ago, but despite  repeated
       requests she has still failed to appear before it;


  (2) notes further that she is scheduled to account to the  Committee  for
       her failure to declare the R50 000 per  month  which  she  claims  to
       spend over and above her parliamentary salary;


  (3) enquires  whether  any  other  member  would  be  accorded  the  same
       leniency; and


  (4) calls on the ANC to discipline her or risk  being  complicit  in  her
       demonstration of contempt for Parliament.

[Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Madam Speaker, I shall move on the  next  sitting  day  of  this
House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the current  administration  of  the  dot-za  domain  name
       space, Mr Mike Lawrie, shows some faith in  the  Government  and  the
       people of South Africa and their capacity to  efficiently  administer
       the dot-za domain in the best interest of all South Africans;


  (2) recognises the work he and other academics  have  done  in  virtually
       founding the Internet in South Africa and  understand  their  passion
       and commitment to their achievements and work to date;


  (3) requests all concerned in efforts to stop any Government  involvement
       in this technical  matter,  which  is  underpinned  with  social  and
       economic considerations to acknowledge that South Africa is only  one
       of several countries who have decided to  enter  into  public/private
       partnerships to administer and/or control  their  country's  Internet
       name space, including Canada, Japan and France; and
  (4) asks that henceforth Mr Lawrie and the  name  space  acknowledge  the
       need for them to work constructively with this Government, so  as  to
       avert the very fears they are expressing over the now highly  emotive
       dot-za domain name issue.

[Applause.]
Mrs B M NTULI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that President Thabo Mbeki charged leaders of the rich countries
           of not caring about human life as  they  failed  to  attend  the
           World Food Summit in Rome; and


       (b)  the absence of these leaders from this summit undermines efforts
           to fight hunger and poverty;


  (2) believes that the  eradication  of  poverty  and  hunger  requires  a
       collective effort of all leaders and stakeholders;


  (3) supports the statement of the President; and


  (4) calls on the  leaders  of  the  rich  countries  to  join  developing
       countries in fighting poverty and hunger.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move  on
the next sitting day of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern that it has become extremely dangerous for  African
           diplomats to serve in  Moscow  due  to  an  increase  in  racial
           motivated violent incidents; and


       (b)  that the situation has  deteriorated  to  such  an  extent  that
           according to press reports the South African Minister of Foreign
           Affairs was even advised to use white bodyguards  when  visiting
           Moscow next month;


  (2) conveys its concern in this regard to the Russian ambassador in South
       Africa; and


  (3) urges the  South  African  Government  to  engage  with  the  Russian
       government on this issue with  a  view  to  securing  the  safety  of
       African diplomats in Moscow at all times.

[Applause.]

Mrs N C NKABINDE: Deputy Speaker, I will move on behalf of the  UDM  at  the
next sitting of the House, that the House -


  (1) notes the case concerning the rights  of  HIV  positive  children  to
       attend nursery school, which was postponed in the  Johannesburg  High
       Court on Wednesday, 12 June 2002;


  (2) further notes the stigmatism that still exists in our  society  which
       is a part of the daily lives of these young children;


  (3) condemns the actions by these adults in setting  such  an  intolerant
       example for our future generation; and


  (4) calls on the Government to implement a national  plan  of  action  to
       address these issues at all levels of our society  including  health,
       social services and education.

[Applause.]

Mrs T P SHILUBANA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that World Day Against Child Labour began on Wednesday, 12 June
       2002, with a series of appeals to reverse conditions that  force  246
       million children to work;


  (2) further notes that although the  ANC-led  democratic  Government  has
       introduced stringent laws which ban child labour,  this  practice  is
       still occurring, especially on farms;


  (3) calls on all who employ children to desist from this deplorable  act;
       and


  (4) calls on all workers and communities to report cases of child labour.

[Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next sitting of  this
House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  an Elsies River primary school choir is in urgent need of  funds
           to go to a Beijing festival in China;


       (b)  this choir is recognised as the  best  in  the  country  in  its
           category; and


       (c)  the choir needs R80 000 to be able to undertake the visit to the
           Chinese festival; and


  (2) calls upon the Ministry of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology  and
       the business community of Cape Town to urgently come to the rescue of
       this wonderful school.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, ek gee hiermee  kennis  namens  die  VF
dat ek op die volgende sitting van die Huis sal voorstel:

  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Minister van Onderwys, mnr Kader  Asmal,  Afrikaanse  instellings
       uitgesonder het tydens sy uitlatings verlede week, ingevolge  waarvan
       hy nie  sal  toelaat  dat  taal  'n  hindernis  is  wanneer  studente
       toegelaat word tot universiteite nie;


  (2) mnr Asmal egter geen woord gerep het oor die hindernis wat Engels vir
       studente is by onder andere die Universiteit van Kaapstad  wat  geleë
       is in 'n provinsie waar 60% van die bevolking Afrikaans praat nie;


  (3) met hierdie optrede van die Minister dit nou  duidelik  word  dat  sy
       uitstel van die aankondiging van die  aanbevelings  van  die  Gerwel-
       verslag, berekend gedoen word omdat hulle nie inpas by  die  Minister
       se transformasie-agenda nie; en


  (4) die VF nie sal huiwer om wanneer nodig, hom grondwetlik  en  juridies
       te beroep op artikel 6 van die  Grondwet  van  Suid-Afrika,  wat  die
       regering verplig om te verseker dat die status van  al  11  amptelike
       landstale in stand gehou, beskerm en bevorder word nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House, I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House takes note that -


  (1) The Minister of Education, Mr Kader Asmal, during his statements last
       week singled out Afrikaans institutions in terms of which he will not
       allow language  to  be  a  barrier  when  students  are  admitted  to
       universities;


  (2) Mr Asmal, however, made no mention of the fact that English is also a
       barrier for students at, inter alia,  The  University  of  Cape  Town
       which is situated in a province where 60% of  the  population  speaks
       Afrikaans;


  (3) with this action from the Minister it  is  becoming  clear  that  his
       postponement of the recommendations of the  Gerwel  report  is  being
       done  deliberately  because  they   do   not   fit   the   Minister's
       transformation agenda; and


  (4) if necessary  the  FF  will  not  hesitate  to  constitutionally  and
       judicially appeal to section 6 of the Constitution of  South  Africa,
       which compels the government to ensure that  the  status  of  all  11
       official languages are maintained, protected and promoted.]

Mr B MTHEMBU: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Mr Ernest Kekana, a 25 year old youth, qualified as  South
       African Airways' first black officer;


  (2) believes that Mr Ernest Kekana serves  as  an  inspiration  to  South
       Africa's black youth by making inroads into a profession  from  which
       black youth have historically been excluded;


  (3) further believes that the ANC-led democratic Government has  provided
       ample opportunities for youth to explore various career paths;


  (4) congratulates Mr Ernest Kekana on his important achievement; and


  (5) calls on all youth to emulate Mr Kekana and  work  towards  realising
       their goals in life.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that the Scorpions  are  being  used  to  pay  off
       political scores;


  (2) believes that  instead  of  acting  as  an  impartial  instrument  of
       justice, this unit is being abused by politicians to smear the DA;
  (3) further notes that by using selective leaks from the Scorpions to try
       to damage the DA, the ANC is turning  this  important  crime-fighting
       organ into a political tool; and


  (4) agrees that if the Scorpions  really  want  to  beat  corruption  and
       restore justice, they should  focus  on  removing  the  cataracts  of
       corruption blinding the ANC, instead of trying to remove the  alleged
       splinter from the eye of the opposition which has nothing to hide.

[Interjections.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I  shall  move  on
behalf of the IFP ...

[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members! Hon members, could you  please  have
some order,  so  that  the  hon  member  can  move  the  notice  of  motion.
[Interjections.]
Continue, hon member.

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Thank you, Madam Speaker.

I hereby give notice that I shall move on behalf of the IFP:

  That this House -


  (1) notes with concern that -


       (a)  HIV/Aids is having  a  decimating  impact  on  the  economically
           active workforce;


       (b)  this tends to have a disparate impact on different  sections  of
           the economy; and


       (c)  165 000 public servants  do  not  have  access  to  any  medical
           assistance; and


  (2) therefore calls on the Minister of Labour and the  Minister  for  the
       Public Service and Administration to ensure that -


       (a)  every department has an HIV/Aids  policy  in  keeping  with  the
           Employment Equity Act;


       (b)  the Code of Good Practice for HIV/Aids is done  in  consultation
           with trade unions, occupational health staff, and human resource
           departments; and


       (c)  all strategies that are  used,  acknowledge  the  centrality  of
           human rights in dealing with the pandemic.

Mr M R SIKAKANE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa has agreed to co-operate with Russia to build
       a 4 200 million space telescope;


  (2) further notes that this instrument will be used to study phenomena in
       the universe that cannot be studied from the ground due to effects of
       the earth's atmosphere;


  (3) believes that -


       (a)  this initiative will provide a better understanding of how space
           science  and  technology   can   be   harnessed   for   economic
           development; and


       (b)  that space technology  can  be  used  in  agriculture,  disaster
           management, urban  planning,  coastal  resource  management  and
           communications; and


  (4) welcomes the co-operation between South Africa  and  Russia  on  this
       historic project.

[Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall
move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes in the light of Youth Day on Sunday, the tragic portrayal of an
       Aids orphan in a nursery rhyme, written by Child Welfare in Pretoria,
       to raise awareness of the plight  of  South  Africa's  450  000  Aids
       orphans, which reads as follows:


         Little Jack Horner
         Sits in the corner,
         Alone with his HIV,
         His mother is dead,
         His father has fled,
         Now he needs love and AZT;


  (2) further notes that this will be the reality for 2,5 million  children
       by 2010 if all South Africans do not accept their  responsibility  to
       provide the needed support in the fight against  HIV/Aids,  which  is
       one of the biggest threats facing South Africa's children; and


  (3) the New NP would like to add its voice to this welfare organisation's
       call for support because we have to do everything  in  our  power  to
       prevent this from becoming  their reality.

[Applause.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the UDM at the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the nation will be celebrating Youth Day on 16 June;


  (2) further notes that the youth today  is  facing  major  challenges  as
       reflected in new reports that incidents of HIV/Aids  in  the  Western
       Cape among teenagers is on the increase, as well as the  findings  of
       Unicef that one in six children in the world are forced to work;


  (3) calls on society to unite around these issues that affect the  youth;
       and
  (4) urges the Government to take the lead in this vital task.

              TWENTY-SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF 1976 STUDENT UPRISING

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  that  Sunday,  16  June  2002,  will  mark  the  twenty  sixth
       anniversary of the  student  uprising  that  occurred  all  over  the
       country in 1976;


  (2) further notes that high school students engaged in  peaceful  protest
       against inferior Bantu Education and called for an  end  to  minority

       important role in the achievement of peace, democracy  and  unity  of
       all people of South Africa, irrespective of race, colour or creed;

  (5) resolves to work  towards  strengthening  non-racial  and  non-sexist
       democracy which they have helped to achieve.

Agreed to.

  That the House –


  (1) notes that the Comrades Marathon, once referred to  as  the  Ultimate

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 23 - Justice and Constitutional Development:

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker,  may
I take this opportunity to salute the spirit and fond memory of my  comrade,
friend and colleague, Steve  Vukile  Tshwete,  who,  were  it  not  for  his
untimely departure from this world,  would  have  been  here  with  us  this
morning.

I wish to assure this House that we are building on the foundations we  laid
together with him when he served as the leader of our cluster of  Ministries
and departments. We are furthermore reducing  the  parameters  of  crime  in
this country and nothing will be allowed to prevent us  from  achieving  the
goals we have set ourselves in this regard.

Like my colleague, Charles Nqakula, I dedicate my input this morning to  the
memory  of  Comrade  Tshwete,  who,  till  his   death,   was   a   gallant,
indefatigable and indomitable fighter for fundamental change  and  a  better
life for all!
My department wholeheartedly embraces our President's  New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development  initiative,  aimed  at  Africa's  renaissance  through
fostering  closer  co-operation  and  partnership  of  the  developing   and
industrialised parts of  the  world.  To  us,  Nepad  is  not  merely  about
economic integration and governance, market access and debt  reduction,  but
is also about good governance, the  promotion  of  peace,  democracy,  human
rights and access to justice.

Neither is Nepad driven by a power elite on a fund-raising campaign.  It  is
about ensuring that through an African  Renaissance,  our  continent,  which
has  for  centuries  been  ravaged   by   colonialism,   mismanagement   and
internecine wars, will take its rightful place in the world  and  shape  its
own destiny.

We, as a department, will popularise this initiative and make  it  real  for
the communities of this  country,  ensuring  that  the  rights  of  all  our
people, particularly women and children are promoted and fully protected.

Part of what we undertake to do in this context is to promote  a  collective
commitment to democracy, the entrenchment of fundamental  human  rights  and
freedoms, good governance and the rule of law underpinned  by  an  array  of
adequately resourced enforcement mechanisms, so that our country  becomes  a
positively infectious prototype, a beacon of hope and a shining example  for
the rest of the world.

To be able to play this role, we need adequate  and  appropriate  resources,
human  and  material.  A  budget  of  R3,8  billion  was   voted   for   the
administration of justice. Of this figure and amount  of  R726  million  was
allocated to the National Prosecuting Authority and a sum  of  R814  million
was allocated for transfer payments.

In real terms, therefore, my department had a total of R1,3  billion,  after
deducting a salary bill of R1,8 billion, for  its  core  mandate.  A  recent
costing exercise of unfunded  activities  has  proven  that  we  require  an
additional R2 billion in order to deliver quality services.

We, however, are not here to whinge  about  the  paucity  of  resources.  We
fully appreciate the fact that there are numerous  legitimate  demands  that
are made on our country's scarce resources.  We  accept  the  need  to  seek
innovative and creative ways  of  doing  things  within  existing  budgetary
constraints. We unreservedly accept the need to  ensure  greater  value  for
every rand placed at our disposal by the taxpayer.

Last year, I reported that we had forged  a  partnership  with  business  in
order to advance good governance in our department. I am pleased  to  report
that as a result our internal audit is functioning  effectively;  the  audit
committee is in place, adding value  to  our  control  processes;  financial
management training is taking place  -  we  recently  trained  2  109  staff
member in this  regard  in  380  venues  countrywide;  sound  administrative
processes and procedure are being put into place; and we are in the  process
of appointing 54 financial  operations  managers  countrywide  who  will  be
clustered  under  the  chief  financial  officer  to  monitor  and   support
financial processes at court level.

The biggest  challenge  facing  my  department  is  the  antiquated  deposit
account  that  cannot  be  audited.  We  are  currently  exploring  possible
solutions to this heavy burden.

During this past year, I visited several courts throughout the  country.  In
certain areas  I  found  the  prevailing  conditions  unacceptable  and  not
conducive to service. Consequently, my department reprioritised  the  budget
allocation to allow for the upgrading of infrastructure and the  procurement
of  basic  provisioning  such  as  telephones,  photocopiers  and  recording
equipment, to the considerable sum of R40 million in the  current  financial
year.

In addition, I am pleased to report on major achievements in  the  field  of
the provision of court accommodation. Nine new magistrate courts  are  ready
to  be  inaugurated;  39  major   works   services   are   presently   under
construction; 51 courts  in  mostly  rural  areas  are  on  our  repair  and
maintenance programme for  the  current  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework
period; and 31 justice centres have already been launched by the  Legal  Aid
Board and seven more are scheduled to be launched this year as part  of  the
major roll-out plan.

This hefty shift from judicare, it should be noted, has already  halved  the
cost of the provision of professional legal assistance to  the  indigent  in
both  civil  and  criminal  matters.  Nine  community  safety  centres  have
benefited or will be benefiting from our national  Community  Safety  Centre
Programme.   Thembalethu,    eNsimbini,    Leboeng,    Khutsong,    Centane,
Tshidilamolomo, Galeshewe, Thabong and Augrabies are  all  in  the  planning
phases.

The construction of six new court buildings will commence this  year,  funds
permitting. Our emphasis is on the provision of facilities in areas of  most
need. The construction of new court buildings at  Khayelitsha,  Blue  Downs,
Botshabelo, Atteridgeville, Bothithong, Atamelang and  Middelsdrift  clearly
demonstrates my and the department's determination in this regard.

In addition, a contract for a new building  at  Tembisa  should  be  awarded
within the next four months. The  estimated  amount  for  all  this  is  R45
million. Sod-turning ceremonies have already  taken  place  at  Tembisa  and
Pretoria North, with one such event scheduled for Port Elizabeth later  this
month.

I am also pleased to inform this House that the sod-turning ceremony of  the
new building for the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg,  which  is  going
to form part of the Constitutional Hill Legacy Project,  took  place  on  18
October  last  year.  This  is  our  single  most  significant  project   in
execution, as it will not only provide the  highest  court  of  our  country
with appropriate accommodation, but will also  be  the  first  major  public
building of the new era of constitutionalism and democracy.
We have experienced  various  security  problems  at  some  of  our  courts.
Numerous security measures have been implemented at various offices  of  the
department, including  the  erection  of  fences  and  the  installation  of
lighting and access-control systems.

Reducing  the  critical  case  backlogs  and  the  population  of  prisoners
awaiting trial is one of  our  major  challenges.  To  be  successful  as  a
cluster,  we  must  implement  an  integrated  package  of  solutions.   The
modernisation of our  criminal  justice  system,  known  as  the  Integrated
Justice System, must serve as the backbone of our partnership.

The overall approach and the system's design address the global  problem  of
integrating  justice  activities  in  an  innovative  way,  to  ensure  that
offenders are properly  and  effectively  managed  through  the  process  of
investigation, prosecution and incarceration.

We have  made  great  strides  in  developing  a  criminal  and  civil  case
management  system  called  the  Court  Process  Project.  At   the   Durban
Magistrate's Court a pilot project has already been established  to  develop
one  of  the  world's  first  integrated  methods  of  managing  courts  and
caseloads. The overall objective is to reduce the average case cycle time.

The project has already yielded the following  results:  4  500  cases  have
been electronically managed in seven courts since the beginning  of  October
last year; 718 juvenile cases were attended to in  the  same  period;  since
February this year, lost dockets  have  become  a  thing  of  the  past;  no
postponements have been experienced as a result of lost  charge  sheets  and
awaiting trial prisoners have all been correctly identified by  the  system;
and no cases of wrong identification of accused persons have  been  reported
since the beginning of the implementation of the project.

We are currently rolling the project out  to  Johannesburg.  The  integrated
case  management  system   will   be   a   world   first   when   completed,
notwithstanding an extremely limited budget.

The development of the civil solution that will initially be used in  simple
civil cases has been completed. This solution, which will eliminate the  use
of hard copies  as  all  case  documents  from  beginning  to  end  will  be
available online, will be implemented on a pilot basis at  the  Johannesburg
magistrate's court within the next month. Meanwhile, we will be  working  on
the necessary amendment to the rules of courts so as to facilitate  a  roll-
out of the solution.

Other initiatives that will impact on service delivery include  the  digital
nervous  system.  All  courts  will   be   provided   with   an   electronic
infrastructure by the end of October next year. The implementation  of  this
project is already underway.

The establishment of  the  intranet  -  with  easy  access  to  departmental
policies, standards, procedures and circulars - will be fully functional  by
March  next  year.  The  court  managers'  programme,  in  line   with   the
constitutional principle of the separation of powers,  will  be  implemented
on an incremental basis within budgetary constraints, in order to  free  the
judiciary from administrative functions. The introduction of ADR  mechanisms
will reduce the awaiting-trial prisoner population, largely  constituted  by
petty offenders.

During the financial year 2000-01  a  total  of  2  794  judicial  officers,
prosecutors and interpreters were trained at Justice  College.  This  figure
will increase this year.

I am pleased to announce that the restructuring and  the  restructuring  and
the rationalisation of our courts  have  been  receiving  focused  attention
this past year, and during the course of this year and the next we  hope  to
complete major initiatives in this regard.

Let me just highlight a few of our endeavours  in  this  regard.  Under  the
leadership of the Chief Justice, who  has  now  become  the  leader  of  the
judiciary in its entirety, we are considering consolidated legislation  that
will deal with the whole court hierarchy. This includes the  rationalisation
of High Courts and lower courts.

As a result of consultations, we are ready to  implement  several  important
recommendations relating to the interim rationalisation of the  jurisdiction
of some of the seats of the High Court under the High  Court  Act  of  2001.
This will impact positively on access to justice in five provinces.

The redemarcation of magisterial boundaries has also largely been  finalised
and I am awaiting a report in  this  regard.  Once  this  process  has  been
finalised,  the  regional  court  jurisdictional  boundaries  will  also  be
defined.

We are furthermore on the verge of introducing  a  new  local  decentralised
court-support-services model based  on  locating  the  delivery  of  support
services at the closest points to customers -  that  is,  at  our  courts  -
whilst still retaining the ability to exploit economies of scale by using  a
clustering arrangements for courts. In  essence,  this  means  a  number  of
courts around a hub court.

In practice, it also means dealing with justice issues comprehensively at  a
local level. This goes hand in hand with the appointment of court  managers.
It is a feature of this model that support services are not  delivered  from
a regional level. I will, therefore, be phasing out regional offices.

This system is intended to co-ordinate the efforts of those who  manage  the
entirety of the system from  the  police,  the  prosecution  authority,  the
judiciary, to correctional services in a goal-oriented manner. The  intended
functions of the court managers  would  include  the  co-ordination  of  the
transportation of prisoners  to  and  from  court,  the  management  of  the
services of the court orderlies and the interpretation services, as well  as
the management of the court calendar.

The roles of the clerks of the court and registrars are being realigned  and
in future will focus more on how to  support  the  case  processes.  In  the
interim,  in  order  to  improve  the  co-ordination  and   integration   of
activities at court and to provide a single nodal  point  within  the  court
from where the entire process is  managed,  the  Integrated  Justice  System
Court Centre project is presently being implemented on a pilot basis  at  23
courts  throughout  the  country,  particularly  where  case  backlogs   are
unacceptably  high.  The  establishment  of  a  court   performance   review
committee to oversee performance and service delivery at courts has  led  to
the establishment of emergency teams to assist in this regard.

With regard to dealing with  court  cases,  the  following  statistics  will
indicate  the  fact  that  the  Criminal   Justice   System   is   improving
progressively in its objective to help make South Africa  a  safer  country.
Sentenced prisoners increased from 115 267 in April last year to 123 498  in
March this year. Unsentenced prisoners awaiting trial decreased from 56  151
in April last year to 55 500 in March this year. District  courts  finalised
313 822 cases last year, an increase from the 219 416 cases in 1999.

Regional courts, where the more serious cases are heard, also dealt with  44
301 cases in 2001 as compared to the 28 579 cases they dealt with  in  1999.
We have also managed to reduce the outstanding cases in the regional  courts
from 45 473 in 2001 to 42 877 in 2002.

Notwithstanding the high number of new cases coming in on  a  monthly  basis
as a result of a clamping down on criminal actions, the courts still  manage
to maintain and improve on their conviction rates.  During  2001,  the  High
Courts achieved a 77% conviction rate,  the  regional  courts  66%  and  the
district courts 83%. Our aim is to increase these rates to 85%, 70% and  85%
respectively this year.

Partly, responsible for these  achievements  was  the  continuation  of  our
Saturday and additional court projects. This  very  successful  project  was
broadened in March this year to an average of 104 Saturday  courts.  Thirty-
one more courts are currently participating in  the  project.  The  Saturday
courts sat on average of five hours 15 minutes per Saturday  in  March,  and
finalised 1 630 cases, each with a verdict.

Eighty-four additional courts, which finalised 1 972 cases, participated  in
the project in March this year, compared to the 37  additional  courts  that
sat in March last  year.  The  conviction  rate  of  all  the  Saturday  and
additional courts in March this year was thus 75%. Up to March 2002, 21  924
cases had been finalised on the basis of this project  since  its  inception
in February last year. In other words, we have exceeded  the  target  of  15
000 cases already.

I want to express my appreciation for the assistance  we  receive  from  the
legal profession, the most prominent aspect of which  is  the  service  they
render as acting presiding  officers  in  the  small  claims  courts,  lower
courts and High Courts, free of charge in most instances. Over the past  few
days, for example, I again appointed members of  the  advocates'  profession
to act as judges on the Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal  Benches  on  a  pro  bono
publico basis,  to  reduce  the  backlogs  in  criminal  appeals  that  have
developed in those courts.  The  Government  welcomes  this  initiative  and
appreciates the spirit of letsema/ilima in which  the  relevant  lawyers  do
their work. And we would like to thank the  professional  bodies  and  their
individual members who readily make themselves available for this purpose.

In passing, I want to join  with  my  colleagues  in  the  criminal  justice
system and call upon members of  this  House  and  leaders  of  the  various
parties represented here to exercise caution when  criticising  the  various
components of the system. Scurrilous and magniloquent attacks  -  which  are
devoid of any basis, in fact - and irresponsible utterances  are  unhelpful,
as we handle the sensitive task of building a new system from the rubble  of
the apartheid society that we inherited eight years ago. They  are,  on  the
contrary destructive.

While we should not tolerate or shield  rotten  apples  in  the  system,  we
should acknowledge that this country is served by some of the finest of  our
people, who deal with some of the fiercest elements in our society  and  are
prepared to lay down their own precious lives for you  and  I  while  asking
for nothing more than the packages we give them  for  their  arduous  tasks.
They surely deserve, at the very least, gratitude and support  from  leaders
like us. It behoves all of us, all responsible leaders to  cultivate  public
confidence in, and respect for the system  if  we  are  to  succeed  and  be
exemplary as a democracy.

While it may be tempting in certain circles to suggest  that  the  judiciary
is not transforming, the figures tell a different story.  Whereas  in  1994,
for example, there were only two women judges and  one  black  judge,  today
there are 23 women and 76 black judges out of a  total  of  204.  Out  of  a
total of 1 662 magistrates, 794 are black and 428 are women.

This has been achieved, notwithstanding the fact that there is a paucity  of
appropriately qualified candidates among blacks and women  as  a  result  of
our past.  Many  of  our  judgments  are  being  quoted  favourably  in  the
development of the jurisprudence of many countries, including,  may  I  say,
the USA and the UK.

As the Government of the Republic of South Africa, we can  say  without  any
fear of contradiction, that we have not in the past eight years,  since  the
people democratically entrusted us with the  responsibility  to  govern  our
country, used any of the components of the system to undermine  and  destroy
the opposition. We have, instead, supported them in  all  their  efforts  to
deal with many  seemingly  intractable  problems  of  crime,  wherever  such
problems may have been located. Our nascent  democracy  will  never  benefit
from any attempt at destroying the opposition.  Nor  will  it  benefit  from
elements criminally masquerading as or hiding within the opposition.

My department has prioritised the protection of  children  in  the  criminal
justice system. The Child Justice Bill, which deals  with  children  accused
of crimes,  will  be  introduced  into  Parliament.  This  Bill  provides  a
balanced approach to the issue of children who commit crimes.

As a society we need to deal aggressively with the scourge of  child  abuse.
The full might of the law needs to be used against child abusers, no  matter
who  they  are,  religious  leaders  included.  The  most   vulnerable   and
defenceless people in our  midst,  children,  deserve  protection  from  all
forms of abuse. Societies and institutions that took rather long to  grapple
with cases of child abuse, as the current  US  Catholic  Bishops  Conference
meeting that is being held in Dallas, Texas illustrates, are paying now.

Relating to the progress on the implementation of  the  Maintenance  Act  of
1998, I  would  like  to  highlight  the  following  aspects.  The  National
Prosecuting Authority is in the process of finalising the appointment of  80
maintenance officers and 10 senior maintenance prosecutors.  The  department
is very conscious of the need to ensure the progressive realisation  of  the
appointment of maintenance investigators. Funds have thus been set aside  to
kick-start the implementation of the law in this regard. The department  has
further prioritised maintenance within a project called the ``Footprint  for
Justice in South Africa''. In this regard, financial  transactions  will  be
diverted through automation, via banks, the SA Post Office and/or ATMs.

Our interdepartmental management team requires R20 million for our  antirape
research and strategy focus. As agreed at a Cabinet meeting in March, it  is
crucial to understand the behaviour of victims and offenders if  we  are  to
reduce the incidence of rape in our communities. The research  process  aims
to look into the  prevention  of  rape,  ie  how  effectively  the  criminal
justice system responds to rape, and  to  evaluate  the  support  structures
that exist for victims and offenders.

Simultaneously, the team will embark on processes to deal  with  the  crises
where appropriate,  while  placing  emphasis  on  building  the  new.  At  a
briefing to the IMSC, a decision was taken to  house  the  team  within  the
Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,  and  specifically
within the Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Unit.

I, publicly, launched the Anticorruption and Fraud Strategy on 25  September
2001. The department has put into place an anticorruption policy and a  code
of ethics for zero tolerance for corruption. All irregular  activities  will
be fully investigated and followed up by the  application  of  all  remedies
available within the  full  extent  of  the  law,  and  the  application  of
appropriate prevention and  detection  controls.  Staff  members  are  being
trained and sensitised to the policy on an ongoing basis. A  national  toll-
free number has been put in place. In support of these initiatives, we  have
commissioned the Auditor-General to do a countrywide forensic audit  of  the
possible impact on our courts.

In addition, the Master's  Business  Unit  of  the  department  initiated  a
forensic audit  of  the  various  guardian's  funds.  The  report  has  been
finalised and appropriate action to address issues raised in the  report  is
being taken. Preliminary findings may mean that we may not get our  targeted
unqualified audit report on the vote account. Moreover, we have  launched  a
compliance unit to fast-track financial  misconduct  disciplinary  hearings,
with the support of the magistracy.

The impact of commercial crime  has  necessitated  a  collective  effort  by
Government and business. As a result  two  focused  commercial  court  pilot
projects have been established in Gauteng and  are  operational  to  provide
the much-needed specialisation in complex commercial crime  cases.  More  of
these courts will become operative in the near future.

A trust involving Business Against Crime, the Arbitration Federation  of  SA
and the National Prosecuting Authority has  been  created  to  fund  private
sector prosecutions. It is now possible to engage the  best  senior  counsel
to manage the prosecution in complex commercial cases. And  as  hon  members
surely should know, we have in place legislation on proceeds  of  crime  and
asset forfeiture that affords commercial crime  units  extensive  powers  to
deal with criminality.

Our Legal Advisory Services  Unit  plays  a  major  role  in  promoting  the
interests of our country, negotiating international agreements,  conventions
and protocols and, amongst other things, providing legal  representation  to
the state and advice to the  President.  It  played  a  major  role  in  the
negotiation which led to the ratification of the Rome Statute, in  terms  of
which the International Criminal Court will come into existence on  1  July.
It is also responsible for all all extradition and mutual  legal  assistance
cases.

As the biggest law firm on the Africa continent,  it  currently  handles  in
excess of 100 000 litigation matters involving the state.  During  the  past
year 322 638 hours were spent on such matters. Significantly,  R72  478  566
was recovered on behalf of client departments and R4,4 million in cost  were
recovered. Matters dealt with internationally  include  the  southafrica.com
domain name case, an arbitration matter in London  involving  R100  million,
and a matter in Washington involving $100  million.  The  division  recently
reached an understanding with the Road Accident Fund in terms  of  which  it
will represent that fund in litigation matters from time to time.

Significant success has  been  achieved  in  the  creation  of  a  dedicated
legislative  drafting  unit.  Future  plans  include  the  formation  of   a
translation  unit  which  will  translate  legislation  into  all   official
languages, and a constitutional litigation unit  which  will  represent  the
state in all constitutional matters.

Essentially, the legal  task  of  implementing  our  Constitution  and  thus
creating a human rights-based order is the  responsibility  of  my  Ministry
and department.

The Department of Justice has had 85 key pieces of legislation  passed  over
the  past  seven  years,  including  the  Administrative  Justice  Act,  the
Promotion of Access  to  Information  Act,  and  equality  legislation.  The
impact of these new pieces of legislation is astronomical. They have  to  be
administered, financed and monitored, needless to say.

As things stand, the focus of attention of my  relatively  small  department
is  scattered  over  a  very  wide  range  of  far-reaching   transformation
processes. Nevertheless, if I were to call for a focus on seven  priorities,
these would be: filling most of the existing vacancies, particularly in  the
National Prosecuting Authority and the magistracy,  to  improve  on  service
delivery; reducing critical case  backlogs  and  the  numbers  of  prisoners
awaiting  trial;  introducing  a  new  court  management  system;   improved
budgeting  and  financial  management  systems;  more  courts  and  improved
service delivery in places of most acute need; an effective maintenance  and
child support system; and the restructuring of the Master's Offices.
With these few words, I wish to thank a whole range of people, ranging  from
the  Portfolio   Committee   on   Justice,   under   the   stewardship   and
chairpersonship of Adv  Johnny  de  Lange,  to  the  department,  under  the
leadership of the director-general; the judiciary under  the  leadership  of
the Chief Justice; the National Prosecuting Authority, under the  leadership
of Mr Bulelani Ngcuka, the National Director  of  Public  Prosecutions;  and
all  others  without  whose  keen  and  dedicated   participation   in   the
performance of this arduous task we could not be recounting these  successes
at all. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, hon members,  I  rise
once again on behalf of the ANC in unconditional support of Budget Vote  23:
Justice and Constitutional Development.

I wish to start, like the Minister, by paying  special  tribute  to  a  good
friend of the Justice family, the late Comrade Steve Tshwete.  History  will
show the role that he played and his contribution to  solving  the  problems
within our criminal justice system.
I also wish to pay tribute to a friend and comrade,  Comrade  Peter  Mokaba.
Hamba kahle, comrades. We will miss you in the years to come.

I once again want to dedicate my speech today  to  a  rather  difficult  and
technical issue, and  that  is  the  financial  management  systems  of  the
Department of Justice, or should I rather say, the  lack  of  effective  and
appropriate financial management systems in the Department of Justice.  Much
of what I want to say should be credited to  the  seconded  chief  financial
officer from Business  Against  Crime,  Mr  Allen  McKenzie,  who  has  done
sterling work over the past years. Whatever successes there are should to  a
great extent be credited to his efforts and energy.

Our department has over the past year reached a deeper understanding of  the
gravity of the findings of the Auditor-General. A thorough analysis  of  the
shortcomings has been made with a view to promoting solutions  aligned  with
the redesigning of financial systems  and  procedures.  The  department  has
been working on corrective measures to address audit concerns for  a  number
of years. These measures were in the past based on the assumption  that  the
requisite fundamentals were in place.  Unfortunately,  this  assumption  was
not validated by the actual state of  the  department's  financial  affairs.
Errors and irregularities persisted and were reaffirmed  by  reports  tabled
by the  Auditor-General,  the  internal  audit,  the  inspectorate  and  the
external donor fund auditors.

How does the department then envisage to turn this serious state of  affairs
around in respect of its financial management system? Any  solution  has  to
commence with a thorough  and  honest  investigation  and  analysis  of  the
environmental design of the department.  The  department's  environment  has
shaped its past, as it will its future. Key to  the  transformation  of  the
department's environmental design is an understanding of the  challenges  it
faces, comprising at least four pillars,  namely  the  people,  the  culture
within the department, systems and processes, and funding.  I  will  briefly
deal with these pillars.

Pillar one comprises the Justice people. While across the board  pockets  of
excellence exist, fundamental problems still remain. Steps taken  in  recent
years had been  necessary  but  not  sufficient,  and  a  comprehensive  re-
engineering  exercise  is  currently  in  progress  to  build  and   enhance
capacity.  Hidden  behind  the  harsh  reality  of  recent  audit   evidence
presented lies some cold comfort in that while there is little to reflect  a
year-on-year  improvement  in  form,  evidence  presented  proves  that  the
department is succeeding in its quest to write up the books and to root  out
fraud and corruption.

Quantifying  the  extent  of  training  needed  to  ensure   competence   is
debatable. However, the department has made a good  start  during  the  past
year. Some 2 109 staff  at  court  level  have  been  trained  in  cash-haul
transaction processing procedures  and  more  than  100  senior  staff  have
received budget training.

Finding solutions to staffing concerns cannot be, and indeed has  not  been,
underestimated. The short-term appointment,  as  the  Minister  has  pointed
out, of sufficiently competent staff at approved rates  of  remuneration  to
fill  numerous  vacancies  is  undoubtedly  a  significant  prerequisite  to
delivery. The average time of six to seven months, but  more  likely  twelve
months, to fill a vacancy is a sign of a system  that  is  overregulated  in
the wrong areas. Work studies, job evaluations  and  the  seemingly  endless
procession of committees and analyses that is not unique to this  department
not only delay appointments, but also ensure  that  critically  needed  jobs
are  not  being  done.  The  Minister   has   elaborated   on   this   quite
significantly.

In addition, we continue often to appoint at rates of pay that prohibit  the
appointment of people competent to do the job required  and  thus  capacity-
building is needed. Major obstacles to delivery thus include  inefficiencies
in employment and procurement practices, and backlog mountains. Without  the
prospect of more funding, better systems, significant training  grants,  and
improved  remuneration  packages  to  attract   more   competent   financial
administrators at court level, the strategy  is  to  divert  workloads  away
from Justice offices by way of the Trust Account Diversion Project, which  I
will speak  about  later,  and  to  standardise  procedures,  the  so-called
Governor Brown Project, of the work that remains.

The second pillar is that of the culture within the department. Starting  at
Justice office level, financial officials do not seem to do their  work.  It
is not that they do it incorrectly, but that they do not do it at all.  This
is attested to  by  audit  findings  of  90%  noncompliance  with  laid-down
systems  and  processes.  Noncompliance  enables  corruption.   To   counter
noncompliance, we must change existing mindsets. Multiple checking  confuses
accountability  and   ownership   of   the   problem.   Responsibility   and
accountability must  be  clearly  pegged.  Investigation,  prosecution  and,
where warranted, conviction must demonstrate zero tolerance  in  respect  of
corruption. As success requires service delivery by all,  incompetence  must
be weeded out where and when  it  is  apparent.  This  was  also  of  course
clearly reflected by our President on one of the most  recent  occasions  he
spoke.

In support of this drive, a full-time compliance unit has  been  established
in the office of the chief financial officer. The purpose of  this  unit  is
to expedite disciplinary action outstanding  in  the  office  of  the  chief
executive officer. Some 2000 financial disciplinary  cases  are  outstanding
in the department. The problem is that this is  still  only  one  unit,  and
even if they were to work 365 days a year, 24 hours a day,  they  would  not
even start denting that backlog.  We  have  therefore  asked  our  director-
general to put further interim procedures in place to make  sure  that  next
year we can report substantive and substantial progress in this regard.

Further funding will  be  required  to  continue  with  widespread  forensic
auditing, training, testing of competency levels, and communication, if  the
problem is to be addressed both  effectively  and  holistically.  Efficiency
savings should enable the sustainability  of  these  measures  in  the  long
term; however, without seed funding these benefits  will  not  be  unlocked.
And at this stage we do not have the seed funding.

An antifraud and anticorruption hotline was established  last  year  and  is
working effectively. A risk management committee has  been  established  and
senior management has been trained in the requirements  for  good  corporate
governance. Culture changes are a process; the process, at least,  is  under
way.

The third pillar  refers  to  systems  and  processes.  Legacy  systems  and
processes are not coping, and in the case of the deposit  account,  that  is
moneys in trust administered on behalf of the  public,  the  contingent  has
been acknowledged as nonquantifiable. The chief  financial  officer  remains
of the opinion that, taken  as  a  whole,  the  management  of  the  deposit
account has collapsed.  Furthermore,  enormous  backlogs  existed  in  voter
counting transaction processing. At this stage these backlogs  have  largely
been cleared.

Given inherent complexities, an  off-the-shelf  solution  is  unlikely,  and
piloting an outsourcing possibility has commenced. I think  I  should  spend
some time dealing with this outsourcing of cash  handling,  otherwise  known
as the Trust Account Diversion Project, to try to explain the extent of  the
problem and how the department is trying to deal with it.

As I have said, the internal audit findings on  noncompliance  by  financial
officials in the Justice offices indicate that  some  90%  of  the  work  in
these offices is not done correctly. Forensic audit findings  are  that  the
risk  of  thefts  and  losses  as  a  result  of  fraud  and  corruption  is
unacceptably high. This is  due  in  part  to  a  lack  of  supervision  and
management, which is not likely to  be  replaced,  since  the  magistry  has
ceased to perform this administrative  function.  The  backlog  that  exists
nationwide, read together with the fact that when backlog  teams  leave  the
Justice office  the  transaction  processing  commences  to  slip  backwards
immediately, indicates that we cannot do the job with  the  resources,  both
people and systems, that we have.

The MTEF requests that we lodged in respect  of  these  needs  received  due
consideration,  but  we  were  awarded   no   financial   backing   in   the
supplementary or MTEF allocations. The current  financial  systems  are,  in
more than 90% of the Justice offices, still manual systems. The  modernising
of these systems cannot be expected in the short to medium term, due to  the
lack of funding.

Thus  given  the  prospect  of  no  improvement  in  resources,   the   only
alternative is less work. Given the possibility of the outsourcing  of  cash
handling, which is in the process of taking place, more  than  half  of  the
workload in courts will be removed. This will enable many  staff  in  larger
courts to be redeployed to activities  such  as  maintenance  investigation,
and in smaller courts it will enhance the  likelihood  that  the  books  and
records will be kept up to date and that court administration  will  receive
more  attention.  In  short,  the  envisaged  solution  seeks  to  put  cash
management under  the  control  of  the  banking  sector,  with  value-added
services attached. Just as we use ATM cards for banks, we  want  to  have  a
similar system as far  as  bail,  maintenance  and  all  those  matters  are
concerned.

The office  of  the  chief  financial  officer  is  convinced  that  without
securing the above goal, the management of the deposit of trust  account  in
compliance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act is  at
this stage not likely. The project is a priority unfunded initiative of  the
office of the chief financial officer, application has been  made  to  USaid
for assistance, and the chances of us getting R4,5 million as  seed  funding
to start this project is good. Hopefully we will have this  project  up  and
running by April next year.

Given that the department does not have the  resources  during  the  current
year to get the deposit of trust account books written  up,  the  office  of
the chief financial officer has concentrated,  where  possible,  on  getting
the vote account books written up, which is more than 90% done.

During the year ahead an attempt will be made to reduce the backlogs in  the
deposit of trust account books. In  certain  areas  these  books  were  last
reconciled in the early 1980s and in other areas they were  last  reconciled
in 1960. That was when the queen was the still  the  supreme  head  of  this
country. [Interjections.] The cost benefit of  getting  these  books  up  to
date across the country is diluted by the fact that due to  missing  records
it is expected that  in  many  instances  the  job  will  be  impossible  to
achieve. With this in mind, given the scarcity  of  funding,  it  is  likely
that available funds will be directed towards creating a future rather  than
to packaging history.

If charged in the short term with the administration of  all  black  estates
in line with legislative imperatives  and  the  Moseneke  judgment,  without
further physical and human resources the Master's Office too will  not  cope
with this additional financial administrative burden. We  may  also  mention
that tremendous strides have been made in the Master's Office,  where  there
is a guardian's fund, in  which  is  deposited  at  least  R1 billion.  Many
strides have been made to sort out the problems there and at least  that  is
on track.

The office of the chief financial officer needs to be entrenched  along  the
lines of a virtual  service  centre,  providing  financial  service  to  the
various business units. This has now been agreed to  by  all  and  lays  the
foundation for the re-engineering of  the  financial  support  service  that
will see the control function being split from the service function.

Control is exercised by the accounting officer, who delegates  authority  in
part to various business unit managing directors.  The  office  of  the  CEO
will consequently and primarily concentrate on transactional processing  and
advisory services, while the business units will  drive  budget-performance-
delegated control responsibilities from the accounting  officers  and  where
deemed appropriate, special financial operations.
At the macro level, the department faces  a  significant  risk  relating  to
sustainability  of  the  ISM  project.  This  project,  in  the  last   MTEF
allocation, asked for R482 million and this was not provided.  Yet,  certain
contractual obligations were undergone. At the year  end,  the  ISM  project
had prioritised some R200 million towards contracting  expenditure  in  line
with the MTEF request. This delays the risk, but does not  dilute  the  fact
that we  have  contracted  for  goods  and  services  for  which  no  budget
allocation has been awarded and hence the continued  development  and  roll-
out of a technology platform is not sustainable without further funding.

Intervention at the highest level is needed. We need to really balance  what
we are getting from those technology needs from what  we  are  putting  into
it, and we have asked the department to engage  with  this  project  and  to
bring a report back to us, to show us how they  feel  that  would  be  done.
There is a further R800 million needed to get this project off  the  ground,
there is just no funding at this stage.
The CFO is encouraged that the department is getting closer to knowing  what
it does not know. If the devil is in the detail, we now know  that  it  lies
in the deposit account. Apart from this, the snapshot  of  our  capacity  in
one year's time will again reflect substantial change and improvements  that
will notably enhance our capacity to deliver.

The fourth pillar of funding I dealt with quite extensively last year and  I
am not going to deal with it in any detail today. I just want  to  say  that
we have most of the best practices in place, the MTEF and the PFMA, as  well
as our base project model. I leave that for another occasion.

In summary, we can say that the four pillars that I have spoken  about  that
form this matrix of the environmental design of the department can  probably
be summarised as  follows:  Building  the  capacity  of  our  department  to
deliver requisite services by investing in  its  development  would  produce
long term benefits and build public  confidence  in  the  administration  of
state institution. We can only achieve this by developing our  capacity  for
service delivery by balancing the competence  of  our  people,  technologies
and processes. In other words, we need to address matters such  as  internal
communication, change management  and  conflict  resolution,  the  level  of
technology used, human resource development, client orientation  and  levels
of corruption and fraud.

Equity and empowerment are well-entrenched as policies and it  is  suggested
that this be underpinned by the acknowledgement that  these  policies  carry
an obligation to invest in the education and training  of  state  officials.
The organisational culture of the department must  change.  Emphasis  should
be given to people, so that they are challenged,  encouraged  and  developed
through systems  that  promote  innovation  while  decentralising  decision-
making, with monitoring and feedback controls.

In conclusion, the chief executive officer has consistently stated that  the
department cannot be micromanaged. There is  a  bigger  picture.  The  facts
presented by the Auditor-General are symptoms of the problem. No  amount  of
fine-tuning will resolve the situation. The department requires  a  cohesive
leadership team - which I can say we have found in our  committee  over  the
past year that it definitely starting to take  shape  and  pay  dividends  -
that possesses the enthusiasm to ensure success and determine a clear  focus
for the department. The current state of affairs  will  continue  to  worsen
before it improves, largely because backlog processing will,  as  previously
projected, enable quantification of contingent losses.

Furthermore, and lastly, a comprehensive performance  enhancement  programme
has  been  launched  to  address  this  whole  vision  of  the   department,
comprising 28 projects, each dealing with  a  specific  problem.  They  have
exotic names such as Governor Brown, Rolling Stone, Justice  Footprint,  etc
I will not deal with them in any detail.

I need to thank everyone in the Ministry, in particular  our  Minister,  who
guides us, leads us and gives us the vision and space to  do  what  we  have
to. I also wish to thank  the  departmental  officials  and  all  the  other
people in the justice family - the thousands and thousands  who  work  every
day of their lives unstintingly to  make  our  courts  work.  They  work  to
different degrees, but the fact of the matter is that they work.  We  should
be proud of it, build on it, thank them and pay homage to them. [Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister, ek  gaan  nie  vandag  oor
die aktiwiteite van die Departement van Justisie kommentaar lewer  nie.  Ons
het 'n besonder aktiewe portefeuljekomitee. [Mr Chairperson,  hon  Minister,
I am not going to comment on the activities of  the  Department  of  Justice
today. We have an exceptionally active portfolio committee.]

We interact with the department. I am at liberty, as an  opposition  member,
to interact and make contributions and  I  thank  the  chairperson,  Adv  De
Lange, for just that. What I am going to do is to point  at  something  that
is becoming a great concern in our broader community.

I  have  here  the  well-known  pocket  edition  of  our  Constitution,  The
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.  This  booklet  contains
one of the best constitutions produced in  the  20th  century.  It  sets  an
example for the 21st century. From the point of view of the citizen, it  has
some distinct features. I wish to mention  two  of  them.  It  converts  the
important, legitimate aspirations and expectations of  the  citizen  of  his
Government into constitutionally protected rights. Secondly, it creates  the
instruments to ensure the actual realisation of those rights.

Most citizens have a dream of being governed justly and  fairly.  They  long
for good governance. They have the expectation that  their  Government  will
deliver and create an environment in which they can work, prosper  and  live
in peace.

Our Constitution does not merely protect its citizens from the bad. It  also
ordains that the citizen shall be entitled to the good. Let us look at  some
of the main features of what he can expect: Everyone has the right  to  have
access to adequate  housing,  health  care  services  and  basic  education.
Government is charged with the duty to achieve this. Section 41(1)  requires
of the Government to ``secure the wellbeing of the people of the  Republic''
and to  provide  ``effective  government  for  the  Republic''.  Our  public
administration must be development-orientated and  people's  needs  must  be
responded to.

I wish to deal with something that I call the  silent  collapse.  I  have  a
friend in the Eastern Cape. During the apartheid years she fought  the  then
government over the lack of or  bad  medical  services,  especially  in  the
rural areas. She served with me  in  the  first  executive  council  in  the
Eastern Cape after 1994, as the MEC  for  health.  Her  name  is  Dr  Trudie
Thomas. She has resigned from the ANC  in  protest.  She  says  that  health
services in the Eastern Cape were better  under  the  apartheid  government.
She talks of the silent collapse. Listen to Dr Pierre du Toit, who  recently
resigned as superintendent of the provincial hospital in Port Elizabeth.  He
cannot take the incompetence and  cannot-care-less  attitude  of  the  Bisho
officials any longer.

It is a common phenomenon that MECs are taken to court to compel them to  do
their job. Yesterday's newspapers report on the  Auditor-General's  findings
on the city of Cape Town in 1998.  I  can  go  on  and  on  and  on  quoting
examples of bad  administration.  Bad  and  ineffective  administration  has
become the scourge of governance in South Africa.

Years ago I told Oom Ray Mhlaba, the then Premier of the Eastern Cape,  that
a good government, a good  constitution  and  good  policies  will  come  to
nought through bad administration. Yet, on the other hand, a bad  government
can be kept afloat by a good administration.

It is time that we focus on bad governance through its  bad  administration.
We have good policies in place. We have  a  good  budget  and  it  comes  to
nought through bad administration.

Ons moet in gedagte bly hou dat dit is net so sleg vir 'n persoon om  beroof
te word van geld, as wat hy beroof word van 'n  huis,  'n  pensioen  of  wat
ookal, as gevolg van swak administrasie. [We must keep in mind  that  it  is
just as bad for a person to be robbed of his money, as it is for him  to  be
robbed of a house, a pension or whatever through bad administration.]

It is as bad to be crippled intellectually  and  educationally  through  the
lack of school books, as it is to be maimed by a knife wound or a gunshot.

Wat kan ons hieromtrent doen? Hier is die antwoorde  in  die  Grondwet.  Wat
kan die gewone publiek doen? Hoftoe gaan, ja. Dit is tog nie  prakties  nie.
Ons het instellings in hoofstuk 9 wat juis daarop  ingestel  is  om  hierdie
dinge  reg  te  stel.  Ek  verwys  eerstens  na  die   Openbare   Beskermer.
(Translation of Arikaans paragraph follows.)

[What can we do about this? We have the answers here  in  the  Constitution.
What can the  general  public  do?  Go  to  court,  yes,  but  that  is  not
practical. We have institutions in chapter 9 which are  particularly  geared
to rectify these matters. I refer firstly to the Public Protector.]

The Public Protector is tasked with the job, inter alia, of investigating.


  ... any conduct in state affairs or in the public administration  in  any
  sphere of government, that is alleged or suspected to be improper.

I propose that the Government request the Office of the Public Protector  to
investigate, as a start, provincial  administrations  and  local  government
administrations, wherever there are complaints of maladministration.

Ek praat nie van bedrog en korrupsie nie. Ek praat van  swak  administrasie.
Ek praat nie van speurders wat moet ingaan nie. Ek  praat  van  kenners  van
administrasie wat vir ons advies  kan  gee  en  die  Regering  kan  help  om
behoorlike  administrasie  in  plek  te  kry.  Ek  wil  ook  verwys  na  die
Menseregtekommissie. [I am not talking about  fraud  and  corruption.  I  am
talking about poor administration. I am not  talking  about  detectives  who
have to go in. I am talking about experts in administration who  can  advise
us and help the Government to establish sound administration.  I  also  want
to refer to the Human Rights Commission.]

Transformation is a problem because it has been pointed out more  than  once
that the way in  which  transformation  was  executed  caused  the  lack  of
knowledge and defaults in administration.

Dit is tyd dat ons presies uitspel: Wat verstaan ons  onder  gelykheid?  Wat
is die Suid-Afrikaanse konsep van gelykheid, gegewe dat  ons  die  beginsels
van regstellende aksie moet implementeer? Hoe implementeer ons  dit,  terwyl
ons die beginsels  van  gelykheid,  doeltreffendheid  en  die  beginsel  van
dienslewering handhaaf? Dit is tyd dat ons weet of dit maar goed is dat  ons
diskrimineer, terwyl ons eintlik net wil regstel. (Translation  of  Arikaans
paragraph follows.)

[It is time for us to spell out exactly: What do we mean by  equality?  What
is the South African concept of equality, given that we  have  to  implement
the principles of affirmative action?  How  do  we  implement  these,  while
maintaining the principles of equality and effectiveness and  the  principle
of service delivery? It is time for us to know if it is in order for  us  to
discriminate, while we actually just want to put things right.]

The Minister has come a long way in  rectifying  a  lot  of  things  in  the
department. We are on our way. The Minister really needs to make  a  further
contribution to the wellbeing of our future, by tackling these  two  issues,
ie the concept of transformation - and we have the institutions to do  so  -
and how it is going to be implemented, as well as the whole problem  of  bad
administration. The Minister should do it for the  future  of  our  country.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms N MAHLAWE: Mr Chairperson, hon members of this House,  given  the  legacy
of the past, the Department of Justice has taken great strides to  transform
the judiciary. If we have to compare with  last  year's  budget  report,  we
have to congratulate the department, the DG and his officials,  as  well  as
the National Director of Public Prosecutions and his  team  on  a  job  well
done. We as the committee have observed a number  of  inclusive,  innovative
and creative approaches to  the  transformation,  very  different  from  the
usual the stagnating and bureaucratic approaches that have been used in  the
past.

Of course, we as the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development also have to congratulate  ourselves,  because  we  have  had  a
profound effect on the operation of the Justice department as  a  result  of
our pragmatic approach to oversight.

My mandate today is to examine Soca. By this I do not  mean  the  World  Cup
Soccer, of course, but the Sexual Offences and Community Affairs unit.  This
includes maintenance, domestic violence,  child  justice,  sexual  offences,
such as rape and child abuse.
Regarding maintenance, it has been and still is a sore point for  women  and
children in this country, especially black women. The  following  statistics
demonstrate the magnitude of this problem. Out of a total of 372  429  cases
in the nine provinces, 273 240 have been dealt with.  This  is  commendable,
although we are not saying that the rest should not be  dealt  with  because
if those cases  are  not  dealt  with,  it  means  that  some  children  are
starving.

Gauteng, I must mention this, has the highest number of cases, that  is  158
551. This clearly shows that men from Gauteng are refusing to support  their
children. I want to commend men from the Eastern Cape because  out  of  this
total,  only  1  155  cases  have  been  reported  in  that  province.   ...
[Interjections.] ...

We fully support these measures and also wish to send  a  stern  warning  to
the people out there that the long arm of the law will catch up  with  them.
We  are  aware  that  there  have  been   some   delays   because   of   the
nonavailability of prosecutors. However, the department has addressed this.
We have noted that the department has trained about 80  prosecutors,  10  of
whom are senior prosecutors. Each province will be getting between  six  and
11 prosecutors and, at least, one senior prosecutor. I  am  sure  that  this
will facilitate the processing of claims. We should clap our hands  for  the
strides taken in this regard.

Coming to domestic violence, in his address on the state of  the  nation  in
February 2002, the President stated that there should be  justice  for  all,
and that this should receive national  priority.  He  also  said  that  this
should be the case particularly with the vulnerable  groups  such  as  women
and children.

To cite an example, just recently two women were killed  by  their  husbands
and a stepmother was allegedly killed by her stepson. There  are  a  lot  of
other cases that I can cite, but I do not have time  for  that.  This  calls
for urgent attention by the department and the justice system.

The  Domestic  Violence  Act  was  promulgated  in  1998,  and  this  is  an
instrument that is available to both the department and victims of  domestic
violence. What is needed  is  for  the  department  to  ensure  that  public
awareness is promoted at all costs, as a matter of urgency.

The proposed  multidisciplinary  centres,  trauma  centres  and  the  victim
assistance programme that is being planned are measures that should  not  be
delayed any longer. Reducing the incidence of domestic  violence  will  have
an effect on the reduction of crime in this country.

Regarding child justice, I would like to say that the department  is  guided
by the national protocol that was launched in this  Parliament  in  2001  by
Minister Pahad. There are about 10 principles that underline this  protocol,
but I will just mention the three most important,  namely,  children  first,
care  for  every  child,  listening   to   children   and   ensuring   their
participation.

There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of children  in  prisons,
but we would like to see prisons that are free of children. Initiatives  are
being taken to address  this,  and  the  hon  the  Minister  has  gone  into
extensive details in this regard.

Coming to sexual offences, we know that rape and child abuse are  common  in
this country. However, I want to say that  the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, together with other departments such as  Health,
Safety and Security, are devising an antirape  strategy  that  is  going  to
deal with all these cases. Soca, on its own, has a number of  partners  that
it is working with in order to address  the  incidence  of  rape  and  child
abuse.

We have here the Gender issues directorate  as  one  of  the  partners,  the
Magistrates' Commission, the Justice  College,  SAPS,  the  National  Gender
Desk,  the  Department  of  Social  Development,  the  National  Network  on
Violence Against Women, Men for Change - I hope that this  organisation  has
an impact on  rape  and  child  abuse  -  as  well  as  Justice  for  Health
Development.

The list that I have just read  actually  shows  the  inclusiveness  of  the
department. [Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, Ministers, colleagues, at  a  glance  the  Budget
Vote before us does not convince me that the  requirements  of  the  justice
system would be met. However, I believe that there is no budget that can  be
described as a good budget.

The problem is that one reads a huge sum of money, in this case R4  billion,
without having the opportunity to really unpack  items,  such  as  salaries,
services and other forms of structural expenditure.

To my mind the most  crucial  area  is  the  salaries  of  the  magistrates,
prosecutors, interpreters and the general staff of the department. We  would
also like not to lose sight of the salaries at Chapter 9 institutions  such,
as the Legal Aid Board and  many  specialised  courts  such  as  the  Labour
Court.

It is, therefore, very  disappointing  that  the  problem  relating  to  the
remuneration   of   judicial   officers,   prosecutors,   magistrates    and
interpreters has as yet not been resolved. The IFP would like  to  see  this
matter being given the highest priority by the Minister and  the  department
so that it could be speedily resolved.

The IFP would also like to see  the  creation  of  a  mechanism  that  would
enable the system, when determining the  salaries  of  judges,  magistrates,
prosecutors  and  interpreters,  to  do  so  in  such  a  manner  that  when
increments come into effect there is no time lag  that  allows  unfavourable
comparisons,  for  instance,  a  senior  magistrate  complaining  about  the
increase given to the National Director of Prosecutions.

Backlogs in court cases are another area that must be given  a  serious  and
speedy  attention.  The  IFP  would  recommend  that  experienced,   retired
magistrates, who are still fit for services on the Bench be contracted on  a
short-term basis in order to alleviate the backlog  problem  without  delay.
The reason for  our  suggestion  is  that  it  has  become  clear  that  the
remuneration offered to magistrates and other judicial  officers  is  simply
not attractive enough to bring new blood into the  system.  Other  forms  of
recruitment must, therefore, be explored.

For instance,  at  the  end  of  January  2002  there  were  only  20  Chief
Magistrates in the country, 17 males  and  three  females,  and  only  seven
Regional Court Presidents, of whom six are male. These figures are  a  clear
indication that something must be urgently done  to  rescue  the  situation.
Ways and means must be found to attract  more  and  better  public  judicial
officers  by  offering  them  competitive  remuneration  packages  and  good
working conditions. If this is not done,  they  will  look  to  the  private
sector to provide them with the  necessary  security  and  amenable  working
conditions.

There are other justice-related concerns that I would  like  to  raise.  The
first deals  with  the  new  financial  and  administration  system  in  the
Master's Office. The department previously indicated  that  the  new  system
would be in place by April this year. Perhaps the Minister could give us  an
indication as to whether this target date for implementation  has  been  met
and, if that is the case, whether the Master's Office is now operating  more
effectively and efficiently.

The second concern relates to e-justice. The introduction of  e-justice  was
announced with much fanfare, but things have gone a bit  quiet  lately.  The
IFP is  fully  supportive  of  using  computer  technology  to  improve  the
efficiency of our judicial system,  but  the  improvement  must  be  clearly
demonstrable.

That raises the question as to how far has the implementation  of  e-justice
gone and how much time and  other  resources  was  it  saving  the  judicial
process? In addition, a very important question  is  whether  e-justice  has
assisted the department with one of its most serious problems, that  of  the
backlog? The budget by no means answers these important questions.

Since the 1998-99 financial year the department has provided in  its  budget
for transfers to the President's Fund to pay reparations to the  victims  of
apartheid. For this financial year the transfer amounts to  a  sum  of  R300
million, which brings the total allocation since 1998 to R800 million.  But,
how much of this large amount has actually reached the victims?  Again,  the
budget does not provide us with the necessary answer?

Over the past few years Parliament's Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts
has been very critical of the financial management and  expenditure  control
at the department. The IFP is, therefore, glad to see that the  department's
internal audit division will be strengthened  by  means  of  an  arrangement
with the private sector in terms of which the latter will provide the  staff
with the necessary audit skills. We  will,  of  course,  have  to  wait  for
Scopa's verdict next  year  to  see  if  this  arrangement  has  led  to  an
improvement in the situation. However, in principle we support the  idea  of
public/private partnership.

The department plans  to  establish  a  constitutional  litigation  unit  to
represent the state in  all  constitutional  issues.  On  the  surface,  one
cannot criticise such a move, but there is one potential concern. Among  the
functions of the unit  would  be  to  advise  Parliament  on  constitutional
matters.

Ordinarily, one would be able to support this, but what is going  to  happen
when the parties to a constitutional dispute are  the  executive  branch  on
the one hand and the legislative branch on  the  other?  Surely,  Parliament
should not have to accept the advice of  a  unit  that  forms  part  of  the
executive in such an event? Until we have more information  on  the  mission
and practical operations  of  this  unit,  we  will  desist  from  making  a
judgment. But the IFP would call on the Minister and department to keep  the
constitutionally guaranteed separation of powers in mind when formulating  a
modus operandi for this unit.

Notwithstanding  our  concern,  the  IFP  will  support  the   justice   and
constitutional Budget Vote. Allow me to  convey  my  gratitude  and  sincere
thanks to the chairperson, Adv De Lange.

UDe  Lange  unesipho  esimqoka  uNkulunkulu  amuphe  sona   sokuthi   akwazi
ukuchazela   wonke   umuntu   emihlanganweni    esiba    nayo,    ngaphandle
kokuthandabuza,  noma  ngabe  lowo  muntu  usuke  eqhamuka  kuliphi  iqembu.
Akesabi futhi ukuxolisa uma ngabe enze  iphutha.  Ngithi  kuye:  UNkulunkulu
ukuphe  isipho,  mfanakithi,   okufuneka   usigcine,   uhambe   naso   futhi
ungasijivazi.

NakuNgqongqoshe  ngithi  siyathokoza  ngoba  uma   simbiza   uyeza   kithina
ngaphandle kokuzenyeza. UNgqongqoshe akasho ukuthi: Bangisaphi abafana?  Uye
eze kithina azosichazela ngakho konke. Siyawubonga nomNyango ngoba nawo  uma
siwubiza uza  ngaphandle  kokuthandabuza,  ufike  usichazele  usinike  lokho
esikufunayo. Sengathi singabambisana njalo.

Uma singabambisana kanjalo, kusho ukuthi kuyakhanya emgwaqweni  wethu  lapho
siya  khona.  Ngakho,   sizokwazi   ukwelekelela   izimantshi,   okungabantu
abazinikele ngempilo yabo lapho besatshiswa khona  nalapho  bebulawa  khona.
Kodwa, bazimisele nokubhekana nezigebengu. Sithi kubo:  phambili!  Singemuva
kwabo futhi  sizobelekelela.  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  Zulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[De Lange has an important God-given gift of being able  to  explain  things
to  everyone  in  the  meetings  that  we  hold.  He  explains  without  any
misgivings, no matter which party one belongs to. He is also not  afraid  to
apologise if he has made a mistake. I would like to say to  him:  ``Brother,
God has given you a gift that you have to keep and not look down upon''.

I would like to express our appreciation to the Minister because he  is  not
shy to come to us when we summon him. The Minister  does  not  say:  ``Where
are these people taking me to?'' He comes to us to  explain  everything.  We
would also like to thank the department because  it  comes  to  us  promptly
when we invite it. It explains and gives us what we want. We wish  this  co-
operation could be a lasting one.

If we can co-operate like that, it means that the road on  which  we  travel
is well lit. We will  therefore  be  able  to  help  magistrates,  who  have
dedicated their lives,  when  they  face  intimidation  and  when  they  get
killed. However, they are prepared to face criminals. We would like  to  say
to them: ``Forward!'' We are right  behind  them  and  we  will  help  them.
[Applause.]]

Mr G SOLOMON: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and members  of  the  House,  the
Department  of  Justice  and   Constitutional   Development   is   basically
responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  courts  and   constitutional
development.

The courts in South Africa are the seats of  the  judicial  authority.  They
are independent and subject only to the Constitution and the law.  An  order
or decision of a court binds all organs of state  and  persons  to  whom  it
applies, and none whatsoever may interfere with the  judicial  functions  of
the courts.

The Constitution or Act 108 of 1996, is the supreme  law  of  the  land  and
binds  all  executive  and  judicial  organs  of  state  at  all  levels  of
Government. It is via the Constitution and the law that a  citizens  of  the
Republic of South Africa expects to live in peace, security and dignity.  It
is via the Constitution and the law that  all  who  live  in  South  Africa,
including those who visit our  beautiful  country,  can  stake  a  claim  to
certain rights.

This is  the  milieu  in  which  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and
Constitutional Development perform its legislative and oversight  functions.
It is clear from this that the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development has a key role to play not only  in  the  domain  of  peace  and
security, but also in the development of South Africa and its  people  as  a
whole. It is for this reason that one of the biggest challenges  facing  the
new democratic Government was, and still is, the  successful  transformation
of the justice system. It is important that we  strive  together  to  tackle
this challenge, and that includes the opposition.
It is clear from our oversight visits to various provinces that the  justice
system  in  South  Africa  is  not  what  it  ought  to  be  in   terms   of
infrastructure,  administration,  auxiliary  resources,   human   resources,
productivity, efficiency and service delivery,  particularly  in  the  rural
areas. This, to a large extent, is due to  the  traumatic  history  of  this
country, particularly the role that justice played in that history.

However, let us ask the following question: Is the justice system  in  South
Africa today  what  it  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  be,  taking  into
consideration  where  we  come  from?  Much  has  been  done  in  terms   of
unification and transformation in order to bring the justice system in  line
with the ethos, requirements, principles and spirit of  the  new  democratic
Constitution.

Indeed,  we  have  succeeded  in  establishing  way   beyond   international
standards an impressive institution of democracy such as the  Constitutional
Court, the office of the Public Protector, the  Gender  Equality  Commission
and the Human Rights Commission. We have managed to put the Legal Aid  Board
on  a  sound  management  and  financial   footing   consistent   with   our
Constitution and the ANC's position on the broad principle of  the  rule  of
law, is that everyone has a right to a  fair  trial.  We  had  the  pleasant
experience of finding that the head of the Legal Aid Board was only a  phone
call away when we encountered problems in the Northern Province.

The sheriffs' profession, which is crucial to our civil justice system,  has
been considerably transformed with the  representative  board  for  sheriffs
becoming more and more aware of human rights  and  working  under  a  strict
code of conduct. We know that many of our  poorest  of  the  poor  have  and
still are suffering abuse from some sheriffs of the  courts.  We  have  also
established a unified national prosecutorial system with a single policy  of
public prosecution and none of the complications  from  provincial  politics
which we experienced in the past.  Our  special  units  dealing  with  urban
terror, organised crime, gangsterism and  asset  forfeiture  have  acquitted
themselves in an impressive way. We are seriously  disrupting  the  capacity
of organised crime, particularly money laundering in this country.

I have to  mention,  however,  that  these  points  of  excellence  in  this
holistic  justice  footprint  in  terms   of   transformation,   efficiency,
productivity and  service  delivery  came  about  with  the  appointment  of
persons who were committed cadres who came through the ranks of the  ANC.  I
mention this, not to praise the ANC or  these  cadres,  but  to  remind  the
opposition of the ferocious attacks  levelled  against  the  ANC  and  these
appointees  when  these  appointments  were  made,  for  its  own  political
propaganda. Today we can see that they have done their jobs without fear  or
favour, with the excellent results which are there for all to see.

In the same breath, I would like to emphasise that this does not in any  way
derogate from the work done and contributions made by persons who  had  been
in the old dispensation, but have come to realise and accept the wisdom  and
benefits of the policies of the ANC. We have met a number  of  them  in  our
oversight visits to the provinces and we commend  them  for  applying  their
experience, indeed, they have a  lot  of  experience  -  in  line  with  the
policies of the ANC for the benefit of all the people whom they serve.

Having said all this, my own understanding of this challenge to  justice  is
that, despite this impressive record with pockets of  excellence,  the  vast
majority of the population  remains  isolated  in  many  respects  from  the
benefits  and  opportunities  that   these   institutions   represent   and,
therefore, from historical renewal of the justice system.

Our oversight  visits  to  the  provinces  have  also  revealed  a  haunting
contradiction in the administration of justice  in  some  areas.  Whilst  we
have a formative break with old order, there is, in some areas, a degree  of
continuity with it. The  chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee  has  on
several occasions strongly told the business units set up to fast track  the
transformation of the justice system, to make provision for  human  resource
training not only to enhance tactical skills, but also to develop a  mindset
ideologically  directed  towards  productivity,   efficiency   and   service
delivery to people in this country.

We are aware that the administration of justice is under strain  for  causes
which we are slowly but clearly beginning to  eliminate.  However,  that  in
itself does not absolve the department from failing to  make  provision  for
the implementation of very important  pieces  of  legislation  with  serious
social implications, particularly to disadvantaged communities.

We are really delighted to know that steps are being taken to implement  the
maintenance and domestic violence legislation. The Minister  of  Safety  and
Security also indicated in his  Budget  Vote  yesterday  that  the  SAPS  is
getting ready for this. Therefore, we can see that  the  integrated  justice
system is falling firmly into place.

We are, however, seriously concerned about the  Act  on  the  prevention  of
unfair discrimination act. The President assented to this legislation  on  9
February 2000, but has not  been  implemented.  The  preamble  to  this  Act
provides that the consolidation of democracy  requires  the  eradication  of
social and economic inequalities, especially  those  that  are  systemic  in
nature.

What does this nonimplementation mean to the daily lives of South  Africans?
Of course, inequality persists  and  racists  and  right-wingers  will  take
their chances to abuse black  people  and  we  will  not  have  the  law  to
prosecute them. If  the  equality  legislation  is  too  cumbersome  or  too
ambitious, let us amend them. But we cannot take  the  risk  of  living  our
largely disadvantaged society split  by  this  fault  line  where  race  and
wealth persists side by side in stark contradiction. It can be dangerous.

In conclusion, I wish to quote our Minister of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development:


  Justice is a virtue. Performance excellence must guide  every  action  of
  those tasked with the administration of justice.
Since I have a couple of seconds left, I would just like addressed  the  hon
Dr Delport. Dr Delport has pointed out various  inequalities  which  persist
in our country. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, it  is  very  good
indeed in this Parliament  to  see  how  hon  members,  in  spite  of  their
political divide, actually have good personal relationships. The  manner  in
which the hon De Lange acknowledged the comments  of  the  hon  Delport  and
Mzizi is very heartening, indeed. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson,  the  2002-03  budget  of  the  Department  of
Justice and Constitutional Development,  on  the  face  of  it,  bears  many
characteristics of last year's budget. As a whole,  it  is  still  seriously
underresourced. As the Minister acknowledged here this  morning,  it  is  R2
billion short if his wish list, which he gave at the end of his speech,  was
to be fulfilled. Its core function, particularly the courts,  which  get  an
allocation of a mere R1,39 billion out of a total budget of  R4,24  billion,
is short-changed.
There is still a lack of balance of this budget. For example,  the  National
Prosecuting Authority, which had R0,94 billion, gets more  than  two  thirds
of the entire allocation for the whole of South Africa's  court  system.  It
is, by comparison, the fat cat of this budget, although, indeed,  the  claim
by the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Bulelani  Ngcuka,  is  that
they are still 40% underfunded.

Then there is  the  perennial  problem  referred  to  by  many  speakers  of
financial mismanagement, the low conviction rate turned in  by  the  courts,
delays and overloaded court rolls, inadequate security at  courts,  unfilled
posts, delays in rationalisation, etc. The list  goes  on  and  on  and  the
problems do not go away.

However, in spite of these problems and disappointments, this year  the  New
NP is going to support this Budget Vote. Why? Because  this  year,  for  the
first time, the briefings by the Justice department seem to  indicate  light
at the end of the tunnel.
There  is  hope;  there  is  improvement  in  certain  areas  including  the
conviction rate. There is an impressive attempt to get to grips  with  years
of financial mismanagement and turn it around, thanks, for  the  most  part,
to Mr Allan MacKenzie. They are  supported  by  the  department,  naturally.
There  are  some  impressive  centres  of  excellence   such   as   National
Prosecuting Authority, which bears testimony  to  what  adequate  resourcing
can do for the inherent talent that resides in  the  Department  of  Justice
and Constitutional Development.

However, what really swings it for  me  this  time  is  the  fact  that  the
director-general has used R20 million from his own  special  policy  reserve
to, at last, appoint maintenance investigators in terms of  the  maintenance
Act.

Year after year, since the Act was passed  in  1998,  I  have  complained  -
together with my colleagues in the portfolio  committee  -  that  there  has
been no allocation of  the  estimated  R35  million  needed  to  make  these
appointments. Now, at last, something is being done about this  vital  piece
of legislation  that  could,  if  implemented  properly,  make  such  a  big
difference to the lives of so many women.

Besides the above, the National Director of  Public  Prosecutions  has  also
come to the party and made a U-turn on his  previously  dismissive  approach
to maintenance courts. As has been mentioned here, he is in the  process  of
appointing 80 prosecutors - 10 senior and 70 ordinary, as I understand it  -
to act as maintenance officers in  the  maintenance  courts  throughout  the
country. I would like to say to the Minister that this is more like  it.  If
one  compares  the  under-resourced  courts  to  the  well-funded   National
Prosecuting Authority, with  its  various  elite  operations,  such  as  the
Scorpions and the Asset Forfeiture Unit,  the  positive  results  of  proper
resourcing are there for all to see. They are neatly summed up in  a  recent
survey that was commissioned  by  the  National  Prosecuting  Authority  and
conducted by the Institute  for  Security  Studies.  The  findings  of  that
survey were published last week.

The above survey found that almost 90% of the victims of violent crime  were
satisfied with the prosecution service at our courts, whereas  the  majority
of those interviewed for the survey did not believe that the Government  has
done a good job in fighting crime and that  sentences  handed  down  by  the
courts are far too lenient. The negative perceptions  that  the  public  has
about the criminal justice system is fuelled, according to this  survey,  by
frequent postponement of cases, numerous delays in  the  court  process  and
lack of information. It makes one speculate what a difference could be  made
to the public's perception of the Government's ability  to  bring  criminals
to book if the courts were proportionately as well-funded  as  the  National
Prosecuting Authority.

There is no doubt that the condition of our courts  gives  rise  to  serious
concern from the top down. I would like to quote the Chief  Justice,  Arthur
Chaskalson, when he briefed the portfolio committee a couple  of  days  ago.
He said:


  The condition of our court buildings and the lack  of  maintenance  is  a
  huge  problem.  Some  are  in  a  deplorable  condition  and   completely
  nonfunctional. Morale is deeply affected.

The Chief Justice pointed out that he was speaking mainly  about  the  lower
courts and particularly about the  lower  courts  in  the  rural  areas.  He
suggested that the situation was so serious that it might require a  special
budgetary allocation. I would like to say to the Minister that it is  always
nice to line up in company with the Chief Justice,  and  this  is  precisely
what the New NP has been saying during the past three Budget  Vote  debates.
To its credit, though, the  department  has  also  embarked  on  a  thorough
survey of the situation in our lower courts  and  the  department's  offices
around the country.

The findings of the department's  court  services  survey,  published  early
this year, do indeed corroborate  the  Chief  Justice's  view.  This  survey
categorised courts and offices by province, in terms of their condition.  In
four provinces, over 30% of the Justice  department's  offices  were  in  an
unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory condition, namely: North  West,  where
30,5% of the offices were found  in  that  condition;  KwaZulu-Natal,  where
40,48% of the offices were unsatisfactory; the Eastern  Cape,  where  nearly
49% of the offices were unsatisfactory; and the Northern  Province  where  a
whopping 63,4% of the offices were unsatisfactory. Something  must  be  done
about this situation!

The Minister referred, in his speech, to the fact that 51 courts  would  now
be upgraded, in terms of their condition. But, that is  less  than  half  of
the very unsatisfactory courts listed in those four  provinces.  Independent
surveys that have been done by university faculties and NGOs  have  come  up
with similar findings. Visits by groups  from  our  portfolio  committee  to
rural courts and offices of the department have also made similar  findings.
Marion Sparg,  head  of  corporate  services  of  the  National  Prosecuting
Authority told the portfolio committee  last  week  that  the  entire  lower
court function in the Department of Justice and  Constitutional  Development
is severely underfunded. She estimated this to be  at  a  R100  million  for
prosecutors alone, and they are the best off of all.

My question to the Minister is: How long can this go  on?  The  evidence  is
overwhelming that the state of the courts is letting South  Africa  down.  I
join the Chief Justice in requesting a special budgetary allocation  to  set
them to rights. In connection with that,  I  would  like  to  say  something
about the Constitutional Court. It is truly one of the great assets  of  our
constitutional democracy. Anyone who has any doubts about South  Africa,  as
a successfully  functioning  democracy,  should  have  attended  the  recent
hearings of the Treatment Action Campaign's case on nevirapine  therapy  for
HIV-positive pregnant mothers and their newborns, as I was privileged to  do
as a member of the portfolio committee delegation.

Although the main protagonists were the  Government  and  the  Tac,  at  the
hearing any party that had any case  to  put  was  represented  by  counsel.
Anyone who wished to observe could be there. Anyone who  wished  to  protest
could do so outside. There were  11  judges,  representing  the  best  legal
brains across the full rainbow spectrum of our nation, actively  engaged  in
counsel. It was certainly no joke to represent a case to those  judges  that
they had a problem with. It was like  withstanding  a  maelstrom  of  cross-
examination by 11 top  counsel  at  the  same  time.  It  was  a  marvellous
experience. However, the frightening thing about all of this was that  there
was no security at all.

Anyone could just walk in. Up to 4:30 pm, in the afternoon, one had to  sign
a book to gain access, but no one checked one's bags.  There  was  no  X-ray
machine. After 4:30, one did not even have to sign in. Surely,  not  finding
resources in order to provide proper security for such an  important  symbol
of our new freedom is false economy. I would like to urge  the  Minister  to
make sure that something is done about that as soon as possible.

Judge  Chaskalson,  this  week,  in  his  presentation  to  the   committee,
generously mentioned the lack of security at night at courts other than  his
own. He pointed out that most thefts of documents  and  equipment  from  the
courts occur at night, exactly when  the  security  is  not  available.  The
department's briefing document deals with security in a mere half  page.  It
says that the Director-General, Mr Vusi Pikoli, had given a  directive  that
all the offices of the department were to be secured. He is certainly to  be
congratulated for that. However, only R40 million  was  made  available  for
this purpose, and this covered some projects  like  the  purchase  of  X-ray
machines for 42 offices, clearly not  including  the  Constitutional  Court,
and securing cash in transit that is clearly  a  good  thing.  Nevertheless,
this amount is hopelessly inadequate. I would  appeal  to  the  Minister  to
make security a priority for the next budget.

Another area which needs some attention is the high rate  of  withdrawal  of
charges. On behalf of the New NP, I would like to congratulate the  National
Prosecuting Authority for its  excellent  and  reassuring  briefing  to  the
portfolio committee. In that  briefing,  much  was  made  of  the  increased
conviction rates in the courts, namely: 83% in district courts; 66%  in  the
regional courts; and 77% in the high courts. However,  the  conviction  rate
does not take into account the huge number of withdrawals. It  applies  only
to cases that were actually proceeded with. If one includes the  withdrawals
a very different picture emerges that must, in some  way,  help  to  explain
the public's negative perception of the criminal justice system.

Of the total number of cases finalised by the district and  regional  courts
in 2001, namely 782 000, more than half, ie 390 577, were withdrawn. If  one
works that out in that way, it makes for a conviction rate of  only  35%  in
those courts. The high withdrawal rate is not only negative.  It  does  show
that prosecutors go through the dockets  carefully  and  do  not  waste  the
court's time on inadequately prepared cases. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I wish to  address
the New NP members. Hon members of the New NP, I do not think  it  is  quite
right for you to have been engaged in conversations with people in the  back
benches, while a member of your own party was speaking.

Mnr J J DOWRY: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek het nie hier geselskap gehou  met  die
mense nie. Ons het gepraat oor die program wat vanmiddag hanteer moet  word,
die volgende debat en die spreker wat daaraan moet deelneem. Dit was nie  'n
onnodige bespreking nie, en ek dink nie dit is reg om ons tot orde  te  roep
nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr J J DOWRY: Mr Chairman, I did not have a conversation  with  the  people
here. We spoke about the programme that must be dealt with  this  afternoon,
the next debate and the speaker who must participate in it. It  was  not  an
unnecessary discussion, and I do not think that it is right that you  should
call us to order.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Dowry, let  me  explain  to
you that the Rules of this House permit you to  sit  side  by  side  and  to
engage in quiet conversation in order to deal with  business.  That  is  not
denied. The fact  that  so  many  of  the  members  were  busy,  engaged  in
conversations with people behind their backs, and turned their backs to  the
Chair, could not be right.

I am requesting that members should come to good order and keep the  decorum
of the House.

Mr M T MASUTHA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, fellow  comrades,  colleagues
and friends, the focus of  my  input  into  this  debate  today  is  on  the
National Prosecuting Authority's allocation. Before I proceed, allow  me  to
express my own disenchantment at my  hon  colleague  for  referring  to  the
prosecuting  authority  as  ``the  fat  cats  within  the  criminal  justice
system''. I do not share that sentiment and I think that  she,  in  her  own
words, has highlighted the shortfall in the allocations that  are  currently
being made to that very vital component of the system.

Since the establishment of the National Prosecuting Authority as a  separate
and  independent  entity  within  the  criminal  justice  system,   it   has
experienced progressive growth beyond traditional prosecuting  services.  It
now includes the Directorate of Special Operations, the  Witness  Protection
Programme, the Asset Forfeiture Unit  and  specialised  units  such  as  the
sexual offences and community affairs unit, and the  specialised  commercial
crimes unit.

The prosecuting authority plays a pivotal  role  as  litis  dominus  in  the
successful prosecution  of  crime.  It  is  therefore  most  encouraging  to
observe the robust contribution made by  the  National  Director  of  Public
Prosecutions, Mr Bulelani Ngcuka, since his appointment  in  that  position.
This, in turn,  has  contributed  significantly  towards  the  reduction  of
crime, as it has come to  the  full  attention  of  all  criminals  in  this
country that the crime profession is not sustainable  and  that  crime  just
does not pay.

One of the key aspects of the turnaround strategy that  was  implemented  by
the prosecuting authority is human resource  development.  The  introduction
of a policy of compulsory training for  aspirant  prosecutors,  before  they
are appointed, and in-service training of up to six months  by  the  Justice
College, are significantly contributing to the  human  resource  development
within the prosecuting authority.

Currently, the prosecuting  authority  runs,  amongst  other  programmes,  a
programme on aspirant prosecutors' training which entails two intakes of in-
service components consisting of some 160  candidates  in  total.  Regarding
ongoing training, some 400 prosecutors were trained by the Justice  College.
Fifty prosecutors attended an advanced prosecutors' course and  28  attended
a trial advocacy course. Twelve decentralised courses for all officers  were
offered between February and September 2001. Further, a  seminar  for  state
advocates was attended by  42  delegates  in  October  2001.  Finally,  five
additional courses were presented on  special  requests  through  which  181
candidates received training in various areas.

For the current year, the trial advocacy courses will be increased to  four.
State advocacy courses and prosecutors' training will be decentralised,  and
managerial and other specialised skills training will be offered.

This hopefully will further capacitate the dedicated men and  women  in  our
prosecuting authority and criminal  justice  system  who  are  committed  to
fighting crime.

In addition, a prosecutors' bible, the Vodemecum, compiled  as  a  reference
for prosecutors and launched on 27 November 2001 in Mamelodi, assists  as  a
handy hints manual for prosecutors.  A  national  statistics  programme  was
launched in 1999 for both the lower courts and the  High  Court  to  monitor
the performance of prosecutors,  thereby  devolving  performance  management
down to provinces, which are now responsible for setting  local  targets  in
respect of court hours, outstanding court rolls,  the  finalising  of  court
cases and the reduction of district court decision and inquest dockets.

The setting up of this monitoring system brought to light the enormous  case
load that was outstanding and in response to this  challenge,  Saturday  and
additional courts were introduced. These  courts  have  made  a  significant
impact in increasing court hours and reducing backlogs, thus  enhancing  the
quality of service to the people. Over 12 000 matters  were  dealt  with  by
these courts between January and September 2001 alone.

Whilst the endeavours of the prosecuting authority  to  improve  quality  of
service through the introduction, amongst  other  things,  of  the  decisive
measures I have just outlined - which have, without doubt,  paid  off  quite
handsomely - there are more challenges ahead. In our provincial visits  over
the past two years, we have come across a  positive  picture  that  confirms
this achievement, but have at the same time  identified  courts  which  were
almost non-functional. Here court rolls were burgeoning by  the  day,  files
gathering dust because of a lack  of  commitment  on  the  part  of  certain
officials, as well as indolence,  incompetence  and  lack  of  co-ordination
between various role-players in the criminal justice system.

In some instances, having officials from the department with us  enabled  us
to assist in  unblocking  some  of  the  hiccups,  ensuring  that  effective
service delivery resumed. It is pleasing to note from the estimates  of  the
national  expenditure  2002  that  expenditure  trends  showed   that   this
programme, ie the prosecuting authority, has grown by an average of 17%  per
year over the seven years under review. This is from 1998-99 financial  year
to the projected 2004-05 financial years.

Its share of the vote will have risen from 18% in 1998-99 to 25% in  2004-05
within  the  broader  justice  budget,  accounted  for  primarily   by   the
establishment of the Scorpions and the  growth  of  the  special  operations
budget by 81,4% per annum. These figures  reflect  the  very  high  priority
accorded by the ANC-led Government to the investigation and  prosecution  of
criminals.

At this juncture, let  me  congratulate  the  Scorpions  on  their  work  in
amongst other things, closing down on  unscrupulous  attorneys  who  defraud
poor, disabled claimants under the Road Accident Fund to sponsor  their  own
lavish  lifestyle.  It  is  most  grotesque  that  members  of  a  dignified
profession such as the legal profession should stoop so low  as  to  exploit
their clients who are in a weaker  position  in  this  power  relation  that
attorneys share with their clients. We hope that  more  investigations  will
be conducted and more such rotten potatoes eliminated from  this  honourable
profession. [Applause.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson, Minister and  hon  members,  the  Department  of
Justice and Constitutional Development plays an important role in our  legal
system. Its function is to uphold and protect the Constitution and the  rule
of law. Justice should be effective and accessible to all.  This  department
should  be  budgeted  for  adequately  in  order  to  meet   its   mandatory
obligations.

Infrastructure is one of the problematic  areas  in  this  department.  Some
court buildings are dilapidated as a result of poor maintenance and need  to
be rebuilt. Their condition do not boost the morale of staff and the  public
in general. This problem of the maintenance of court buildings is  of  major
concern and needs to  be  attended  to  immediately  by  the  Department  of
Justice and Constitutional Development and the Department of  Public  Works.
Shortage of buildings is one of the major problems facing  this  department.
There  are  not  enough  court  rooms  and  this  results  in  cases   being
unneccessarily remanded, causing a backlog of cases. On the other hand,  the
number of awaiting-trial prisoners is increasing in prisons.

This shortage of court buildings  makes  it  difficult  for  justice  to  be
accessible to members of the public. At some  places,  court  buildings  are
very far and public transport is used to get to  these  courts.  More  money
should  be  used  to  build  court  buildings  and  equip   such   buildings
adequately. Some courts have no proper equipment such as photocopy  machines
and computerised systems of paying maintenance. At one  point  I  was  at  a
Soshanguve court and  there  they  still  use  a  manual  system  of  paying
maintenance. There is also a lack of trained staff in some courts.  One  may
find a young and inexperienced prosecutor having to prosecute a crime he  or
she has no experience on.  This  is  especially  serious  where  an  accused
person is represented by a well-experienced attorney or advocate.

Sufficient prosecutors should be employed, because the  number  of  criminal
cases  that  are  handled  by  each  prosecutor  is  huge.  Prosecutors  are
overworked and it is sometimes difficult for one to  consult  properly  with
witnesses and prepare adequately for trial. This also leads to  cases  being
unnecessarily postponed. This budget does not  meet  all  the  requirements,
but should be used to serve the most deserving projects  of  the  department
and not be misused by corruptible officials  for  corruption  purposes.  Any
corruption should be dealt with accordingly and corrupt officials should  be
kicked out of the department.

In conclusion, I would like  to  thank  the  chairperson  of  the  portfolio
committee for the manner in  which  he  conducts  the  proceedings  of  this
committee.  Furthermore,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Minister  and  his
department for their efforts in trying to help the public with  the  limited
resources that are at their disposal. [Time expired.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson and hon Minister, the  purpose  of  government  is
primarily  to  protect  life,  liberty  and  all  individuals  by  punishing
evildoers and protecting law abiding citizens.  The  Department  of  Justice
clearly has a significant role to play in this regard. The  ACDP  wishes  to
commend the DG and his team on a vastly improved financial report.

Whilst the department has not yet arrived, it has  made  tremendous  strides
in  stabilising  and  controlling  its  expenditure.  Having  completed  two
provincial tours to various courts, including the Constitutional Court,  and
visiting various Chapter 9 institutions, it is clear to  me  that  dedicated
justice staff, prosecutors and judicial officers are committed to serve  the
public, often under very trying conditions.

The problems in the various links in the criminal justice system,  from  the
arresting  and  investigating  officer  to  the   prosecutor,   correctional
services officer, interpreter,  judicial  officer  and  the  defence  lawyer
remain a challenge. A delay in any one of these links severely  affects  the
whole chain and adds to the backlog of cases, with a knock-on effect on  the
number of awaiting-trial prisoners.

The ACDP supports the recommendation that the various  portfolio  committees
involved  in  the  justice  cluster  meet  jointly   to   discuss   problems
experienced  in  rendering  an  official  and  effective  criminal   justice
service. The commitment by the  department,  judiciary  and  prosecutors  to
address court backlogs by  means  of  Saturday  and  additional  courts,  is
laudable. Without these courts the backlog would be much more  severe.  What
is even more significant is that the number of awaiting-trial  prisoners  in
custody is decreasing. The application of  section  63(a)  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Act should further reduce the number of awaiting-trial prisoners.
As of January this year, 20 692 accused persons were  found  by  magistrates
to pose no threat to the community, but are  costing  the  state  almost  R2
million per day to keep them behind bars  because  they  cannot  afford  the
bail. The social cost of locking  up  these  persons  -  who  are,  in  law,
presumed to be innocent until proven  guilty  -  in  these  universities  of
crime is inestimable.

My main complaint today relates to the delay  in  the  introduction  of  the
Child Justice Bill. I posed the question during last year's budget  vote  as
to when the Bill would be introduced. I was hoping that this  Child  Justice
Bill would have been processed earlier this year. However, as  the  Minister
has indicated earlier this morning, it is yet to  be  introduced.  It  is  a
shame that a substantial time has  been  spent  processing  the  politically
expedient crossing-the-floor legislation, whilst this  very  necessary  Bill
is delayed. I must, however, commend the National Prosecuting Authority  for
applying restorative justice principles  and  for  aiming  to  increase  the
diversion of child offenders away from the formal justice process.
In conclusion, the ACDP will support this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr J H JEFFERY: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, I rise on  behalf  of
the ANC  in  full  support  of  this  budget.  Budget  debates  give  us  an
opportunity, whilst looking at the proposed expenditure  and  programmes  of
the department for the coming financial year, to look back  and  assess  how
things have gone. In assessing the work of the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, we need to look at how far we have come.

The Freedom Charter, adopted  just  nearly  27  years  ago  to  reflect  the
aspirations and concerns that people faced in 1955, stated  that  all  shall
be equal before the law. It went on to state under that section that no  one
shall be imprisoned, deported or restricted without a  fair  trial;  no  one
shall be condemned by any order  of  any  government  official;  the  courts
shall be representative of  the  people;  imprisonment  shall  only  be  for
serious crimes against the people; and all laws which  discriminate  on  the
grounds of race, colour or belief shall be repealed.

We know that from 1955 until the advent of democracy  in  1994,  justice  in
South Africa deteriorated sharply. In evaluating  the  achievements  of  the
Justice Ministry and the department, we need to look  at  how  far  we  have
come. It is clear that considerable progress has been made.  Bar  the  issue
of representivity, which needs further work - and I will come back  to  this
point - the other aspirations of the Freedom  Charter  relating  to  justice
have been met.

We  have  seen  the  considerable  progress  in  the  restructuring  of  the
judiciary, the establishment of  the  National  Prosecuting  Authority,  the
development of a human rights culture and the rule of  law.  In  particular,
in this past financial year there  has  been  considerable  improvement,  as
other speakers have referred to, in the efficiency of the  courts  in  terms
of the number of hours of sittings and  the  conviction  rate.  It  is  only
rarely, as far as the Freedom Charter is concerned,  that  the  question  of
representivity requires further work.

One of the reasons why representivity is important is that  the  courts  and
the justice system needs to reflect the people of the  country.  One  cannot
expect support for the justice system if it is  effectively  a  white  man's
court.

As far as the figures that we were given for the bench are concerned -  they
are up to the 30 June 2001 - 70% of  the  judges  are  white  and  only  19%
African. Of all these judges only 11% are women.  As  for  the  magistrates,
the figures that we were given, which are as of  the  end  of  January  this
year, show that roughly one quarter of the magistrates are  women  and  just
over a third, African. Obviously those figures need to change. They are  not
reflective of the population of our country.

I know that one of the  key  issues  that  is  raised  with  regard  to  the
appointment of judges is the limited number of suitable  candidates  because
of the insufficient pay that judges are given.  In  the  past  there  was  a
fairly lengthy path to becoming a judge. Judges were  drawn  from  advocates
who started off as junior counsel. One took  silk  and  after  a  number  of
years of service in which one had a lot of  time  to  accumulate  fees,  one
finally got appointed as a judge. As a result  of  historical  restrictions,
we do not have a large pool of  African  advocates  or  attorneys.  Suitable
candidates for the judiciary are younger and have  not  had  the  chance  to
accumulate experience as their white counterparts have done.

The  Judicial  Officers  Amendment  Bill,  which  is  currently  before  the
portfolio  committee,  proposes  the  incorporation  of  judges  under   the
Commission for the Remuneration of Public Representatives -  the  commission
which determines or makes recommendations on the salaries of MPs  and  other
public representatives - make recommendations on the  salaries  of  judicial
officers. It may be that this is a solution, but  this  needs  to  be  fully
debated and may not solve the problem of insufficient funds. So this  is  an
issue that really needs more attention, and we need  to  collectively  apply
our minds to it.

The transformation of the judiciary and the magistracy  is  not  just  about
representivity, but also about attitudes. It does not matter that one is  an
old appointee or a new appointee, it is important  that  those  people  that
are judicial officers are in touch with the feelings of the people  of  this
country. In the era of the old white judges in particular, they  represented
a tiny section of the population, while statistically  most  of  the  people
coming through the courts as accused, complainants  or  witnesses  were  not
from their race group and they had little  knowledge  of  how  these  people
viewed life. I remember a former  Attorney-General  of  Natal  with  whom  I
argued a concern that the judges in his province were  not  sufficiently  in
touch with the people, and he told me that they were because they  read  the
local newspaper, the Natal Witness.

I think if the judges are going to reflect the  concerns  of  South  African
society as whole in the way they dispensed justice, and  in  particular  how
they sentence people, they need to be more in touch.  They  need  to  be  in
touch with the concerns, the aspirations and the conditions that people  are
facing. Only  then  can  they  confidently  speak  about  the  interests  of
society.

I just want to briefly touch, in the remaining time, on  three  issues  that
one came across in the provincial visits of the portfolio committee  to  the
provinces. The first is the issue of rationalisation of the High Courts.  We
have had a report in  the  portfolio  committee  -  and  the  Minister  also
referred to it in his speech  -  that  although  the  so-called  independent
states of Transkei, Ciskei, Venda and  Bophuthatswana  ceased  to  exist  in
1994, in 2002 their High courts or former Supreme Courts are still with  us.
The North West province  in  particular  has  three  jurisdictions,  ie  the
Northern Cape High Court, the TPD and a  bit  of  the  Free  State/ThabaNchu
falling under it. Steps have been taken to transfer ThabaNchu  to  the  Free
State, but I would urge the Minister to ensure that speedy action is  taken,
particularly in resolving the North West and the Eastern Cape issues,  where
one has effectively three divisions of the High Court.

A further issue I want to touch on is the issue of languages in the  courts.
In many parts of this country all participants in  a  criminal  trial  speak
the same language, yet the trial is interpreted and conducted in English  or
Afrikaans. The issue of the language of record was raised at the  Ministers'
colloquium at the end of 2000, but this issue still has  not  been  resolved
and I would urge that it be given attention. A language  of  record  may  be
necessary for an appeal. But in a situation where everybody speaks the  same
language there is  nothing  stopping  the  trial  being  conducted  in  that
language. Somebody can then translate the record if there is going to be  an
appeal.

The last issue I wanted to highlight was the question  of  court  buildings.
Firstly,  there  appears  to  be  a  lack  of  co-ordination  between  court
officials  and  officials  from  the  Department  of  Public  Works.   Court
officials complain that  they  do  not  know  what  is  happening  with  the
repairing of their buildings. A further aspect is also the  former  homeland
courts  being  considerably  underresourced  or  in  a  bad  condition,  and
seemingly not getting sufficient attention in that regard.

I would like to end with an observation from our provincial  visits.  I  was
particularly impressed by the large number of people in the courts  who  are
committed to the vision of the Minister in taking steps in their own  places
to do what they can to improve the experiences that our  people  are  facing
with the justice system. That was very encouraging and I think those  people
need to be promoted and given further encouragement.

We also found that in those courts where there  was  structural  interaction
between  the  different  divisions  -  i.e  between  the  magistrates,   the
prosecutors and the other court officials - the problems which those  courts
were facing tended to be resolved  or  dealt  with  more  favourably.  Those
kinds of steps need to be encouraged as well. [Applause.]
Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, hon Minister, the  core  function  of  the
department is to give effect to the constitutional  requirement  that  South
Africa have  a  fair,  equitable  and  accessible  system  of  justice.  For
instance maintaining, improving  and  streamlining  the  system  of  courts,
investigating crimes, prosecuting all criminal  offenders,  providing  legal
services to government, researching, drafting and promoting legislation  and
facilitating  the  delivery   of   additional   services   linked   to   the
administration of justice.

The budget allocation of R3,8 billion to this department is inadequate  when
one takes into account the fact that part  of  this  amount  is  from  roll-
overs. From this budget, provision must be made  for  institutions  such  as
the Commission for Gender Equality,  the  Public  Protector  and  the  Human
Rights Commission. Consideration must also be made  for  the  implementation
of legislation, increasing the capacity of the  courts  and  increasing  the
remuneration of judicial officers.

It is important to acknowledge the fact that this department has  structured
organised programmes such as administration, state legal  services  and  the
National Prosecuting Authority. All these programmes are very important  and
none can be sacrificed for the other,  lest  the  objectives  are  lost.  We
appreciate the department's close co-operation  with  its  partners  in  the
integrated justice system to develop solutions to weaknesses in the  justice
system. This has led to projects aimed at modernising the administration  of
justice to transform both  the  nature  and  delivery  of  the  department's
services, such as the re-engineering of the budget management processes,  as
well as promoting and maintaining an anticorruption and fraud strategy.

Although good and reasonable motivation has been advanced to  justify  roll-
overs, this practice should be discouraged and avoided because it is not  in
keeping with the Public Finance Management Act. We in  the  UCDP  appreciate
the efforts of the department in its approach  to  transformation,  both  in
character and human resources. This is  a  clear  demonstration  of  service
delivery and is people orientated. We are mindful of the fact that Rome  was
not built in one day. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairman, the  PAC  supports  this  budget.  We  find  it
adequate  to  improve  services   in   the   Department   of   Justice   and
Constitutional Development. In  view  of  the  serious  crime  rate  in  our
country and accumulated court cases, it is important that there  be  massive
training and employment of  competent  magistrates,  prosecutors  and  court
interpreters,  as  well  as   rapid   Africanisation   of   this   important
institution. The numerical superiority of the African population  demands  a
visible reflection of this majority in our courts.

It  is  puzzling  that,  despite  the  need  for  the  high  employment   of
magistrates and  prosecutors,  there  are  many  African  persons  with  LLB
degrees who find it difficult to obtain jobs in  the  Ministry  of  Justice.
There are reports that there continues  to  be  appointment  of  incompetent
contract  prosecutors  at  sky-high  salaries.  This  is   especially   with
reference to Court 25 in the Port  Elizabeth  Magistrates  court.  Temporary
and contract magistrates are appointed without the  Magistrates  Commission.
This is also the case in the  regional  magistrates  courts.  These  reports
need investigation to establish their authenticity.

The PAC is disturbed that despite the R800 million for the reparations  fund
voted for the 2001 budget, many victims who, according to  the  TRC,  should
have long received their reparations, have not received  a  cent  thus  far.
The Government must break its silence on the R800  million  for  reparations
and tell the survivors of apartheid and the nation how this money  has  been
spent and why many victims have not been paid.

Something else is puzzling.  When  is  a  crime  against  humanity  a  crime
against humanity? For instance, South Africa has recognised  crimes  against
humanity in Yugoslavia and Burundi. Judge  Richard  Goldstone  was  sent  to
these countries for crimes against humanity there, while the  TRC  turned  a
blind eye to the crime against humanity committed against Africans  in  this
country. That is why, for  example,  Kenny  Motsamai  is  serving  two  life
prison sentences, plus 19 years in Mangaung prison;  Kwanele  Masizi,  three
life  prison  sentences,  plus  24  years;  and  a  former  Apla  chief   of
operations, Letlapa Mphahlele, is on bail of R30 000 - he has  been  charged
for his past armed anti-apartheid activities. [Time expired.]

Miss  S  RAJBALLY:  Chair,  Minister,  our  strong  South  Africa  has  been
subjected  to  racial  policies  for  centuries  -  slavery,  indenture  and
inequitable  laws,  culminating  in  the  horrific  division  laws  of   the
apartheid regime. We stand today correcting and undoing that past. In  order
to achieve results, we need a diverse strategy, intentions, definitions  and
aims to  our  course.  The  MF  proudly  notes  the  manner  in  which  this
department carries itself. Its mission is to -


  ... uphold and protect the Constitution and the rule of the  law;  to  be
  accountable to public and the state in rendering accessible, fair, speedy
  and cost-effective administration of justice in the interest of  a  safer
  and more secure South Africa.

This is a clear depiction of the  interests  of  all  South  Africans  being
protected in a  just  and  equitable  manner.  Just  as  pleasing  is  their
strategy to promote constitutional democracy,  providing  appropriate  legal
service, sound management  of  courts  and  alternative  dispute  resolution
mechanisms. We find the skeleton well constructed to  make  this  department
as effective and efficient as possible, yet the tools to  make  it  possible
are minimal.

Cases still drag on for months on end and our prisons are still full to  the
brim. Also, with the  changes  to  legislation  being  rather  gradual,  the
validity of past and present laws is often  contested,  placing  persons  in
the legal field at a very difficult crossroads.

The MF notes the seriousness of the situation in the  department  and  hopes
that the budget for the forthcoming year shall be adequate  to  indulge  the
department's mission and activate its strategy  to  a  much  greater  extent
than in the past year. The  need  to  inculcate  justice  earnestly  and  to
construct  a  society  with  moral   values   depends   upon   justice   and
constitutional democracy. Upliftment is crucial.

Programmes and projects are in place to involve business and communities  in
the big chase against illegalities present in our communities.  It  is  felt
that the department should join hands with  the  Department  of  Safety  and
Security to exhibit to society the price paid for crimes,  a  strategy  used
by many countries to inculcate prevention.

While the MF supports this Budget Vote, let  me  take  this  opportunity  to
congratulate the chairperson of the portfolio committee  on  the  manner  in
which he handles it. I always think that he would make good judge  or  jury.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Chairperson, hon members, I rise on behalf of the ANC  to
support this budget. A reggae singer by the  name  of  Peter  Tosh,  in  his
album  entitled  Equal  Rights,  made   important   observations   when   he
said:``Everybody is talking about crime, but who are  the  criminals?  Every
body is heading for the top, but how far is it from  the  bottom?  Everybody
wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.'' [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Everybody is talking about crime, but who are the criminals?  I  think  this
is an important question for us in South Africa, because  there  are  people
who believe that when a suspect is arrested, he is already  a  criminal.  In
terms of our law a person is not a criminal until found guilty by the  court
of law.

As a nation, we must help the police and  the  prosecutors  to  answer  this
question. Most of us know the people who commit crimes in  our  communities,
but we are sitting with that information.

At our homes, some of us behave in ways that suggests to our  children  that
violence is the answer to solving problems. The violence that  we  sometimes
expose our children to when we beat their  mothers,  is  the  same  violence
they will use to hijacked and kill.

The problem of crime is an indication of a moral degeneration that has  been
there in our country  for  a  very  long  time.  The  system  used  to  give
promotions and accolades to murderers who killed our people, like Eugene  de
Kock.

In certain instances, people were forced to pay bribes  to  the  then  bantu
local councillors to get houses. In a case where the  father  of  the  house
died, brothers  were  forced  to  enter  into  false  marriages  with  their
sisters, even with their mothers, so that their houses could  not  be  taken
away by the local authorities on the grounds that there was no father.

The people who murdered 700 young people in 1976 were never brought to  book
by the then government of apartheid, but they were congratulated  on  a  job
well done and encouraged to do more. I  am  saying  this  because  in  years
after that, more people were killed by the SA Police Force.

It hurts, because some of the people who are  responsible  for  those  acts,
who benefited from such actions and whom we have tried to forgive,  are  the
same people who are saying that the ANC-led Government is  failing  to  deal
with crime. We do not  need  to  be  simplistic  when  we  deal  with  these
matters. However, we acknowledge, as the ANC, that the issue of crime is  an
important and very sensitive one.

It must never be an issue that is  used  for  party-political  gain.  People
have lost their loved ones because of crime, and children are without  their
parents. People steal from the poor. Sometimes old, sick  and  the  disabled
people do not get grants because of some greedy corrupt person or persons.

Our approach, as the ANC, is that crime  needs  to  be  tackled  nationally.
That is why, through the  Moral  Regeneration  Movement  we,  have  included
organs of civil society. Through our policy of Letsema/Ilima,  as  the  ANC,
we are trying to inculcate a  spirit  of  giving  amongst  our  people,  not
always receiving, because those who always receive have got  a  tendency  to
develop a  culture  of  entitlement.  That  culture  may  lead  to  criminal
activity.

We still believe that the National Youth Service Programme will be  able  to
instil that culture of giving amongst young people. In the long term,  these
are some of the programmes that will change mindsets which is necessary  for
moral regeneration.

Through our policy of a better life for all, we  are  trying  to  give  each
person a reasonably good quality of  life,  because  we  know  that  without
that, a fertile ground for crime becomes stronger. We  are  avoiding  taking
the easy ways out, because those are not sustainable.  There  is  one  thing
that one is always taught and reminded of in the ANC, ``Tell no lies,  claim
no easy victories.'' We will continue to uphold that  principle.  These  are
not going to be achieved overnight.

Let me highlight some of the successes of  the  prosecutorial  authority  to
show that a lot  is  being  done.  The  conviction  rate  in  our  court  is
continuously increasing. The National Prosecuting Authority is committed  to
improve this conviction rate to be even more better.

With regard to the Asset Forfeiture Unit, so far 55 of the  85  applications
involving R22 million have been finalised, with a success rate of 88%.  Most
of the assets frozen by the Asset Forfeiture Unit will be  returned  to  the
victims of crime.

Regarding the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit, the unit has  been  dealing
with commercial crimes, especially in big cities. By the end of March  2002,
it had enrolled 321 cases, 253 of which were brought to court. Of those  253
cases, 171 cases resulted in convictions.

With regard to the witness protection unit, there are  still  some  problems
of inefficiencies in the way it has been run. Some cases of corruption  were
also discovered and have been referred to the  special  investigating  unit.
Some work is being done to revamp the  system,  so  that  witnesses  can  be
treated with the dignity they deserve.  The  war  against  crime  continues.
[Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, I want to devote my  contribution
to this debate to only one crucial  issue,  that  of  extended  amnesty  for
political prisoners and other persons who may still  be  prosecuted  accused
for politically motivated crimes prior to 1994.

Let me state it very clearly, right from the start,  that  this  is  serious
business and not a place for  cheap  politics.  The  very  fate  of  several
persons and their families is at stake, and even more so,  the  whole  issue
of real reconciliation in South Africa. Furthermore, as this is a  sensitive
national issue, it is important that all political parties play  their  part
in this process.

As a matter of fact, the hon the Minister has  opened  new  doors  for  this
debate in his budget  speech  in  June  last  year,  when  he  said  that  a
political  process  should  be  considered  to  address  this   issue.   The
presidential pardon granted by  President  Mbeki  to  33  prisoners  in  the
Eastern Cape has also brought the whole issue on the agenda again.  If  this
was only a one-sided, once-off deal for  former  ANC  and  Apla  cadres,  it
would be regretted.

If, however, this presidential pardon will be  extended  also  to  political
prisoners from the ranks of  the  IFP  and  the  Afrikaaner  community,  for
instance, it could be seen as an attempt by the President to  set  the  ball
on a move and use his privilege in accordance to  section  84(2)(j)  of  the
Constitution to help close the books  of  the  past.  However,  presidential
pardon can only partially address the problem.  It  is  only  applicable  to
persons already convicted and sentenced.

The TRC has finally closed its doors as  of  31  March.  Different  opinions
exist regarding the whole TRC process. However, the most crucial  matter  is
how to address the unfinished business of the  TRC,  regarding  amnesty  for
alleged offenders who either did not apply for  amnesty  or  did  apply  but
could not get  it  through  the  TRC  process.  This  includes  high-ranking
officials of the ANC, including 37  persons,  most  of  whom  are  presently
serving in Cabinet or other executive positions. It also  includes  generals
from the formers security service.

However, it is not only the  big  brass,  but  also  several  persons  whose
actions were politically motivated, some of  them  presently  in  jail,  but
who, for technical reasons, did not qualify for  amnesty.  It  is  important
that these matters be addressed by way of  a  political  process  that  will
serve both justice and reconciliation in a nondiscriminatory way.

The AEB proposes a form  of  collective  amnesty,  through  which  political
parties can apply for amnesty for persons who, although not specifically  by
order of the relevant party, acted  in  the  belief  that  they  served  the
purposes  of  their  party.  This  may  include  persons  presently  serving
sentence in jail and persons outside. A judge could  be  appointed  in  each
province to hear these cases.

This is not a plea for  unqualified  general  amnesty.  Specific  benchmarks
should be laid down by legislation. A political  and  not  a  mere  criminal
motive must be determined. The conduct and attitude of the  prisoner  should
be taken into consideration.  Also  important,  although  a  very  emotional
issue, the profile of the victim may  never  be  the  decisive  factor.  For
instance, the two men  convicted  of  the  murder  of  Chris  Hani  and  the
prisoner serving a sentence for  the  murder  of  a  footsoldier  should  be
treated alike.

Furthermore, an extensive process like this will have much more  credibility
than a selective trade-off between big brass from  the  one  side  and  VIPs
from the other. Unlike the plea that was heard from  certain  quarters,  the
side on which a perpetrator fought may not be the  determining  factor.  All
of them executed their deeds under  the  impression  that  their  cause  was
just, more often than not charged up by politicians and agitators who  never
had to stand trial.

The argument may be raised that further amnesty will make a mockery  of  the
TRC process. However, the view of the AEB is that the TRC must  be  regarded
as a specific tool for  a  specific  time,  ie  the  turbulent  transitional
times. Clearly, an orderly, controlled political  process  may  still  serve
justice in times of calmer waters.

The AEB admits that such a process should be addressed through  legislation,
preferably supported by all political parties. The AEB  calls  on  different
role-players to embark on a process that will finally  close  the  doors  of
the conflict of the past and prove that real reconciliation also extends  to
those who, although foolishly, acted through  their  own  genuine  political
convictions.

Yes, this may be a process that can stir up emotions here and there, but  if
treated fairly and within the parameters of generally accepted  legislation,
a  sound  and  thorough  process  of  collective  amnesty  can  be  a   most
significant indicator of and  contributor  to  real  reconciliation  in  our
country.

Who could ever have imagined that victims would ask for  the  release  of  a
high-profile prisoner  like  Eugene  de  Kock?  When  I  read  that  in  the
newspaper it really struck me that maybe our nation  is  finally  coming  to
terms with the process of healing and reconciliation.

The AEB calls on the Minister to embark on this process without  unnecessary
delay. We also call on all political parties,  even  those  who  might  have
been neither part of the struggle nor the system, to put themselves  in  the
position of those who are still behind bars for what they  have  done  in  a
war that ended nearly 10 years ago.

Let us treat this sensitive  matter  not  from  our  own  political  vantage
point, but as a nation coming to terms with its past. Maybe this can be  the
real test for our commitment to real reconciliation. [Interjections.]
Adv H C SCHMIDT: Chairperson, the Business Day of 28 May 2002 reported  that
a study conducted by the Institute for Security Studies-


  ... had found a surprisingly  positive  attitude  towards  a  prosecuting
  authority amongst those with experience within South African courts.

However, it states  that  while  there  were  negative  perceptions  of  the
criminal justice system in South Africa, 56% of those polled  believed  that
Government had not done a good job in fighting crime, and only  28%  thought
that the Government had rendered a good service.

Although the contents of this report favour the prosecutorial  services,  it
clearly states the bad state of affairs, which is to be found  in  the  rest
of the departments. In fact, Government has failed the people  by  a  margin
of at least 56% in not providing a proper criminal justice system.

Whilst I would wish to  compliment  the  prosecutorial  services  for  their
commitment and hard work in bringing about his much-needed change, a  crisis
seems to be looming within other parts of the department. The  rendering  of
maintenance service, an important issue, especially for women and  children,
still seemed to be plagued with major problems, despite  steps  having  been
taken, albeit small. Saturday  courts  and  additional  courts  have,  to  a
limited extend, alleviated the  backlog  of  awaiting-trial  prisoners,  but
only in so far as regional courts are concerned. In  fact,  an  increase  in
awaiting-trials prisoners in the High Courts and district  courts  has  been
reported.

Lack of experience amongst prosecutors and administrative staff seems to  be
an ever continuing problem. The high conviction rates in  the  High  courts,
as well as the regional and district courts, do  not  reflect  the  lack  of
trust which the general public has in  the  department.  The  amendments  to
section 63 of the Criminal Procedure Act, implemented during December  2001,
have not yet witnessed enough prisoners being released  from  prison.  There
are instances where minor crimes justify this.
We in the DP believe that criminals should serve their term of  imprisonment
when sentenced by courts of law. However, we also  believe  that  those  who
are awaiting trial should, where possible, be afforded  the  opportunity  to
await  trial  within  the  community  from  which  they  are  held,  pending
finalisation of their trials. This  is  merely  called  the  presumption  of
innocence under the application of the rule of law.

It has been noted in committee meetings that ``the criminal  justice  system
is like a chain - the strength is only as good as  its  weakest  links''.  I
venture to say that this chain has more weak links than it  has  links  that
enable the justice system  to  function  effectively  and  expediently.  The
witness protection programme might be heading for an  improvement.  So  too,
does the Asset forfeiture unit appear to be  operating  with  a  measure  of
success. However, these successes appear  to  be  exceptions  to  the  rule,
rather than the rule itself.

Furthermore, we appear to be on the dangerous brink of a possible  abuse  of
the judicial system and certain offices for  political  gains.  Never  again
should a legal system and any of  its  official  investigating  agencies  be
used to intimidate, harass  and  pester  the  proper  working  of  political
parties and the  democratic  system,  as  happened  under  the  previous  NP
government. As members are acutely aware, the then  SAP,  legal  system  and
correctional services were abused to enforce apartheid. We  do  not  need  a
repeat of history. We should jealously guard against this.

Currently the Department for Justice and Constitutional  Development  blames
the Department of Safety and Security  for  its  problems.  The  Safety  and
Security department blames correctional services for  its  woes,  whilst  in
turn - and to complete the full circle - correctional  services  places  the
blame on both the Departments of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,
and  Safety  and  Security.  This  is  the  most  ideal  way   of   avoiding
responsibility.

When can we expect action to be taken on at  least  some  of  these  issues?
[Applause.]
Mr L T LANDERS:  Chairperson,  for  many  years  the  Legal  Aid  Board  had
operated in the red. Despite numerous efforts by the Department  of  Justice
and Constitutional Development to address this problem in the past,  it  was
only the recent appointment of Judge Mahommed Nafsa that led  to  the  Legal
Aid Board's finances being turned around. Simultaneously,  Judge  Nafsa  and
his board have put in place structures and programmes that have resulted  in
increased efficiency and effectiveness. Most importantly, these  initiatives
have resulted in justice being made accessible to the poorest  of  the  poor
and the indigent.

One of these initiatives,  supported  by  the  ANC-led  Government,  is  the
justice centre, which is a one-stop centre located within  or  as  close  to
our townships as possible, where our poorest citizens can  enjoy  access  to
justice by visiting such centres and obtaining even  the  most  basic  legal
advice and assistance.

During  the  Justice  portfolio  committee's  visit   to   the   Chapter   9
institutions recently, we had the privilege to visit the justice  centre  in
Alexandra  township.  What  members  of  the  Justice  portfolio   committee
witnessed at this centre should serve  as  an  inspiration  to  all  of  us.
Whilst  accommodation  at  this  justice  centre  cannot  be  compared  with
anything found in Sandton  or  Bishop's  Court,  for  example,  it  was  the
quality of work emanating from these  humble  premises  that  serves  as  an
inspiration.

We were introduced to young man who, in providing legal  assistance  to  the
indigent, handled in the region of 50 cases per month. Any good lawyer  will
tell you that this comprises an astonishing workload. Yet,  this  young  man
did so uncomplainingly and, indeed, with good humour.  This  young  attorney
has been so  successful  in  his  work  that  magistrates  at  the  Randburg
Magistrates' Court insist on allocating legal aid work to him, even when  he
does not or cannot do it. We cannot commend enough the work done by  Justice
Nafsa, members of the Legal Aid Board, and  officials  in  all  our  justice
centres.

Sithi halala, Legal Aid Board, halala! [Ihlombe.] [We  say  congratulations,
Legal Aid Board, congratulations! [Applause.]]

We note the announcement by  the  hon  the  Minister  that  31  new  justice
centres are due to be launched this year. We welcome  this  announcement  by
the  Minister,  which  serves  as  a  manifestation  of  the  ANC's   stated
commitment to making justice accessible to the people.

This brings me to the Stein judgment and its implication for the  Legal  Aid
Board and its work. Financially, this judgment requires that  an  additional
R150 million per year has to be found by the legal  aid  board  -  money  it
does not have. Moreover, this judgment will  have  a  multiple  or  knock-on
effect on the backlog of cases before our courts.

One of the institutions falling under the  umbrella  or  the  aegis  of  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development is  the  Scorpions.  We
have heard hon members today heaping praises on the work being done  by  the
national prosecuting authority, including the Scorpions. We had  hoped  that
activities of the Scorpions would never be politicised. Regrettably, in  the
recent past, and again this morning, we heard efforts  at  politicising  the
activities of the Scorpions. Now, I think we need to  address  this  matter,
particularly the complaints emanating from  the  DP.  It  is  a  fact  that,
according to evidence provided by  an  official  of  the  DP,  DM99 000  was
handed to him and per the instructions of another  senior  official  of  the
DP, this money was deposited into a bank account.

My understanding of the law  is  that  this  was  a  violation  of  exchange
control regulations and Reserve  Bank  rules  making  these  transactions  a
criminal offence. [Interjections.] Why should the hon Mr McIntosh  determine
who does the  investigation?  When  did  the  hon  Mr  McIntosh  become  the
National Director of Public Prosecutions?

An HON MEMBER: Are you the National Director of Public Prosecutions?
Mr L T LANDERS: We  are  not.  We  never  said  we  were.  The  decision  to
investigate is taken by the relevant  investigating  body,  which,  in  this
case, happens to be the Scorpions. [Interjections.] Yes, we have  heard  all
that. [Interjections.]

The evidence emanates from an official of the DP.  An  official  of  the  DP
then proceeded to  launder  this  DM99 000,  again  in  violation  of  South
African law. Now, the DP is saying that, in  the  face  of  all  this  prima
facie evidence,  ie  violation  of  exchange  control  regulations  and  the
laundering of  money,  the  Scorpions  must  not  investigate  this  matter.
[Interjections.]

Surely if  the  DP  stands  by  the  principle  that  they  themselves  have
enunciated, they should laud the investigation of this matter?

An HON MEMBER: We welcomed it!

Mr L T LANDERS: No, the DP did not welcome  it.  They  are  criticising  the
fact that the Scorpions are investigating this matter. [Interjections.]  But
a while back the hon the leader of the DP ...

Dr J T DELPORT: Chairperson, is the hon member prepared to take a question?

Mr L T LANDERS: No! A while  ago  the  hon  the  leader  of  the  DP,  Lance
Corporal Leon, went on record in a television interview, saying  ``If  there
is evidence  of  the  DP  breaking  the  law,  why  are  the  Scorpions  not
investigating it?'' Those were his own words. Today the Scorpions are  doing
precisely what Tony Leon requested, and the DP is now  raising  a  complaint
about it. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

There is a stink in the state of the DP. The DP sets  one  standard,  ie  it
demands a high standard for everyone else, but a  completely  different  one
for itself.

Let us leave aside the Morkel and Marais soap opera  that  is  taking  place
here in Cape Town. Something that chilled me to the base  of  my  spine  was
when I opened the Mail & Guardian of May 24 to May  30  2002.  The  headline
read: ``DA government hired torcher cop.'' It read as follows, and I quote:


  The man whose company bug-proofed offices for  the  DA-led  Western  Cape
  government is the same apartheid security policeman  who  led  a  62-hour
  interrogation of activist Neil Agget before his death in detention. Agget
  committed suicide 20 years ago after 70 days in detention, torcher and  a
  marathon interrogation session presided over by Stefaan Pieter Whitehead,
  then a security  police  lieutenant.  Whitehead  is  now  the  boss  TSCM
  Services, a Pretoria-based private  security  company  embroiled  in  the
  bugging and spying scandal in the Western Cape. During the latter part of
  Agget's  detention  at  Johannesburg's  notorious  John  Voster   Square,
  Whitehead, dubbed ``the controller'',  was  directly  in  charge  of  the
  interrogation.
  [Interjections.]

I repeat, there is something rotten in the state of DP. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,  I  am
rising essentially to commend the hon members for what I broadly  regard  as
a very positive discussion on my Budget Vote. I hope that the way  in  which
we have conducted this debate is, indeed, indicative of the  desire  of  all
of us to work together, to grapple with the problems that we are facing.

Hon members have quite correctly made a  number  of  observations  regarding
the system. I want to say to all of the hon members who  spoke  here  -  and
even those who did not speak - that we take seriously the observations  that
have been made. As a Government, and certainly as a people, we do not  stand
to benefit from incompetence and sloppy work at  all.  We  never  make  good
policies if only to fail after that. We never make good  laws,  if  only  to
undermine ourselves.

But there are problems which, as the hon Johnny  de  Lange  quite  correctly
pointed out, are traceable,  interesting  enough,  to  the  days  when  this
country was the responsibility of Her Majesty's government. Some of us  only
saw what the ballot box and the voting  station  looked  like  on  27  April
1994. Before then, for all manner of reasons,  we  were  never  regarded  as
qualified to participate in that.

Yet, of course, having inherited the stinking socks and boots of  our  past,
we are having to make do with the resources, unfortunately, that  come  from
the past.

The hon Delport talks about affirmative action. Firstly,  there  is  nothing
wrong with affirmative action. The Constitution deliberately says  that  all
measures that are necessary to correct the wrongs of our past  ought  to  be
taken under the law. There is nothing wrong  with  it.  But  then  again,  I
would fight anybody who says that affirmative action is equivalent to  being
black. That is not necessarily correct.  Affirmative  action  is  not  about
blacks, because they are black or  women,  because  in  gender  terms,  they
happen to  be  women.  Affirmative  action  is  about  people  who,  without
deliberate and conscious intervention, will never make it  in  life.  It  is
about the shack dweller,  the  child  who  has  no  home,  etc.  It  is  not
necessarily about blacks, that I want to  say  as  a  proud  achiever  among
blacks: I would walk into any job, once the ceiling that the white  minority
placed above us is removed. I certainly believe so. [Applause.]

I do not think, for instance, that judges  of  the  order  of  Deputy  Chief
Justice  Pius  Langa  made  it  to  the  Constitutional  Court,  because  of
affirmative action. Dikgang Moseneke and many others are not  there  because
of affirmative action. They are there, because eventually this  country  has
recognised that they belong exactly where they are now. [Applause.]

When there are blacks with the necessary skills,  experience,  etc  who  can
compete for jobs, it would be erroneous  for  anybody,  especially  for  any
leader, to suggest  that  blacks  got  it  because  of  affirmative  action,
otherwise they would never have gotten it. What they  are  then  saying  is:
Despite the many changes that have happened in this country, blacks  do  not
belong there, except if they are allowed to walk into jobs on the  basis  of
the crutches of affirmative action. I refuse that.  There  are  many  blacks
who have walked into jobs purely on merit. [Applause.]

Let me come to the next subject. The hon Camerer talks about the  high  rate
of withdrawals. In  fact,  she  would  be  making  a  mistake  to  base  her
conclusions on cases reported, for many reasons. There  are  many  instances
where  people  walk  into  police  stations  and  report  cases,  but   when
investigations are mounted, we find  that  we  do  not  have  the  necessary
evidence. Withdrawing a case is never  taken  lightly  by  the  police,  the
Scorpions or the prosecutors. Eventually, it is taken solely  because  there
is insufficient evidence on the basis of which we can succeed in a court  of
law.

It is useful to remember that we are required  to  prove  the  case  against
anybody we bring before our courts  on  a  very  simple  and  yet  difficult
standard: proof beyond reasonable doubt. If we have  doubts  ourselves,  why
waste the court's time? Why waste the public resources? Why waste money?  We
should look at those cases where we are convinced that we have  a  case,  ie
we have the evidence. The figures then begin to show that the  success  rate
is indeed impressive. But more than that, when one looks  at  it  that  way,
one will  realise  that  we  compare  favourably  with  other  jurisdictions
similarly situated.

She says, of course, that the National  Prosecuting  Authority  consists  of
fat cats. I dispute that. It consists of a series of real  cats,  lions  who
are very hungry and who do indeed fight crime. Halala to them. [Applause.]

I have deliberately chosen not to respond to any TRC-related  issue  because
as it is known, the TRC is going to file its report with the head  of  state
pretty soon. We will have time to debate that report  here  and  maybe  also
look carefully at a whole range of suggestions,  including  the  suggestions
made by the hon Aucamp this morning.

There was a suggestion that somebody somewhere in Government is  abusing  or
manipulating some  element  of  the  criminal  justice  system.  I  want  to
challenge anybody who has the evidence regarding who is doing this, to  take
appropriate action. If somebody has evidence that I, Penuell M  Maduna,  son
of Thokozile  Maduna,  am  doing  it,  produce  evidence.  If  somebody  has
evidence that Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi manipulates the system  for  political
reasons, produce the evidence. If somebody has evidence that Ben Skosana  is
doing it, produce the necessary  evidence.  Again  I  want  to  say:  It  is
grossly inappropriate for  anyone  of  us  to  dare  to  suggest  that,  for
political reasons, these agents and agencies of law enforcement must not  do
their work. Nobody in the Republic of South Africa, including  the  head  of
state, is above the law. We live in a  constitutional  state.  If  there  is
evidence of the commission of crime or, for that matter, if there is a  need
for a person to be investigated, I want to say on behalf of the ANC and  our
Government: We shall not protect anyone.

They were clapping hands when,  indeed,  the  Scorpions  were  investigating
Toni  Yengeni.  They  were  clapping   hands   when   the   Scorpions   were
investigating Winnie Mandela. Yet now, we are supposed to mourn because  the
Scorpions have  actually  turned  the  light  of  scrutiny  in  a  different
direction. [Applause.] The hon members must remember  their  own  words  and
utterances. Not  so  long  ago  they  were  screaming  blue  murder  at  the
suggestion that things were not going right in the  country  next  door,  as
far  as  the  relations  between  the  government  and  the  judiciary   are
concerned. They were saying all manner of  things  as  certain  things  were
allegedly happening in Zimbabwe.

Now, they are the first ones to say that  a  judge  of  the  High  Court  is
actually not supposed to handle particular work because he  has  a  past  of
fighting against apartheid under the auspices of the ANC. [Applause.]  Their
own statements said that he was a chairperson of an ANC branch. Again,  that
is factually not incorrect. It is correct.  But  then  again,  we  are  able
ourselves to point to evidence regarding the participation of  other  people
in similar activities on the  other  side  of  the  then  apartheid  defined
political divide.

We as the ANC, say that it serves absolutely no useful  purpose  for  us  to
indulge in that if we want  to  inculcate  a  culture  of  respect  for  our
judiciary, and to cultivate a culture of confidence in the criminal  justice
system. If that is our aim, it serves no useful purpose to  say,  each  time
when a judge is presiding over on a matter, that he is the  brother  of  so-
and-so Hartzenberg. He is an aunt of so-and-so, who he was an NP leader.  We
do that deliberately as the ANC, because we  want  to  build.   We  want  to
invite them to change  their  ways  and  join  us  in  this  very  important
national project. They would enjoy working with us. But they  should  please
not attack any judge, knowing that he is  defenceless  ...  [Interjections.]
... and then complain when it is allegedly happening elsewhere.

With those few words, I want to commend all members -  including  those  who
do not deserve a commendation - for what  I  think  has  been  a  very  good
debate. It was a very good and very helpful debate. Indeed,  we  have  taken
quite seriously the observations made by the two speakers on behalf  of  the
DP, and we want to say to them: We do not want to fail. We do not  want  the
good policies that have been made by all of us here and the good  laws  made
in this institution, to be undermined by incompetent  and  sloppy  hands  in
the Public Service. All the questions they raised - quite legitimately so  -
on behalf of our people are going to be investigated by all of  us,  with  a
view to ensuring that the  system  gets  stronger;  that  we  succeed  as  a
democracy and that we stand out as a shining  example  of  what  this  whole
world of which we are a part, can achieve. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

             LETSEMA: YOUTH SERVICE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Chairperson, hon members, once again I wish to  thank  the
youth for giving me the opportunity to share  this  particular  period  with
them, which is very close to my heart.

Let me, from the onset, proclaim to all the world to know that South  Africa
cherishes, is proud of and loves its youth. It is therefore  not  a  mistake
that since the advent of the new  democracy  in  our  country,  the  highest
office in the land, that of the President, plays host to the National  Youth
Commission. As the Freedom Charter says, South Africa belongs to  all  those
who  live  in  it,  both  black  and  white.  So  does  the  National  Youth
Commission, which is formed of a colour of  spectrum  of  youth  across  our
land.

The importance attached to the youth affairs by  this  Office  in  order  to
unite and improve the social, educational and  economic  conditions  of  the
youth in general,  is  a  sharp  contrast  compared  to  how  the  apartheid
government conducted itself in the face of students' hunger for education.

In addition to other relevant Government  departments,  the  Office  of  the
Youth in the Presidency must ensure that we never, ever  again  subject  our
youth to the brutality and slaughter experienced on 16 June 1976. It  should
play a pivotal role in engaging and harnessing the energy of the  youth  and
intervene timeously in certain situations to calm down volatile situations.

Very recently we saw students taking to the streets,  both  in  schools  and
tertiary institutions. The demand of the school students in Soweto was  that
school gates should not be locked during school break or  lunchtime  because
there are students who go home for lunch. They argue that there are  parents
who are not able to give their children money to buy food  at  the  schools'
tuck shops. Their other demand is  that  there  should  be  a  scrapping  of
school fees. They insist that education is free and compulsory.  [Applause.]


So the circular issued by the MEC for Education in Gauteng restrains  pupils
from leaving the school premises during lunch time. Comrade Ignatius  Jacobs
states that when students leave the school yard during break, very few  come
back  for  the  next  session  of  lessons.  While  some  would  come   back
intoxicated, others would not come back at all. This, as a  result,  affects
those learners who come back to continue with their class work and  disrupts
proper learning.

Furthermore, those who do not come back lose out if lessons go  on  at  all,
and this has a direct bearing on the performance of students and the end-of-
the-year results.

To overcome the problem of their needy students, Mokgome High School in  the
Meadowlands, in Soweto, devised a plan. Out of a total of 600  students  the
school identified 120 who require assistance. The teachers  and  the  school
governing body, led by the principal, began a  fund  raising  campaign  that
continues to gain momentum in order to feed the 120 students  identified  as
from destitute families.

The question we are asking is: Where is  Cosas  when  such  initiatives  are
spearheaded by teachers?

An HON MEMBER: Ask Dennis Bloem!

Regarding the issue of the scrapping of  school  fees,  let  us,  again,  be
vocal in saying that we support the stance adopted by the  Gauteng  MEC  for
Education when he stated that the  struggle  for  the  demand  of  free  and
compulsory education has been fought and won. Payment of school fees is  not
compulsory in all public schools.

The South African Schools Act passed  in  1996  protects  any  student  from
expulsion from any public school system. What one  has  is  a  situation  in
which the school governing body, which is constituted of students,  parents,
teachers and other interested parties, evaluates the finances of the  school
and comes to an amicable agreement on the amount of money  to  paid  towards
school in order to contribute to the general administration of the school.

Such fees are not compulsory. Any family that  is  able  to  prove  lack  of
income can be exempted, and pupils are able  to  go  to  school.  Since  the
governing body has  a  fundraising  committee,  which  is  tasked  with  the
responsibility to raise funds for the wellbeing of  the  school,  one  would
like to know the role of our own student organisation at this stage.
Having said that, let us make  this  one  emphatic  statement:  We  wish  to
pronounce that we love the militancy of the youth, their  daring  nature  in
the face of danger and the energy  and  zeal  in  undertaking  projects.  We
should continue to cherish their  stamina  and  harness  their  talents  and
energies, while steering them in the right direction.

It would be sad, indeed, if, in the history of our struggle for  liberation,
we ourselves could be found responsible for  undermining  the  very  pillars
which underpin our freedom. We should, collectively,  take  one  giant  step
and march in defence of the revolution.  Against  revolution,  nothing,  but
for revolution, everything.

Suppose that I was to address students together  with  the  late  hon  Peter
Mokaba. Comrade Peter Mokaba would start by saying  to  the  youth  and  the
students in general: ``Roar young lions, roar!''

HON MEMBERS: Roar!

Mr S D MONTSITSI: I am happy that the lions can still roar. [Laughter.]

The road to freedom is steep as the struggle continues. It presents us  with
challenges, which we have to overcome, particularly  challenges  facing  our
present generation of youth.

On  the  agenda  of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  is  a
discussion of the manner in which humanity at present  utilises  the  meagre
natural resources to ensure that survival of the  future  generations  shall
not be  threatened,  nor  compromised.  In  Education  they  are  discussing
development of skills for personnel in Africa,  particularly  the  education
of the girl child.

The democratic Government has put  the  world  stage  and  platform  at  the
doorstep of our present generation of youth. The onus, then, is on  them  to
act, that is to learn and shape their future.

We have been informed that Anglo Plus and De Beers continue to  control  90%
of the diamond mines in South Africa, and that a  marginal  10%  is  in  the
hands of the emerging Mvelaphanda, which is largely African-owned.

The challenge of HIV/Aids faces all  of  us,  particularly  the  youth.  The
youth should harness all their energies and fight against the disease.  They
should preach safe sex and talk openly about the disease.

Alcohol and drug abuse is a challenge not to be taken  lightly.  During  the
trial of Basson, the former apartheid scientist, we heard  how  drugs  began
to flood the townships during the years 1996 and 1997,  after  the  unrests.
Apparently, this was meant to disorientate the youth and shift  their  focus
from the struggle. We insist to this day that there is no such  a  thing  as
``a lost generation''. If it does exist, it should do so in the  dreams  and
minds of its architects.

We would go on to say to the young people of South Africa that the  type  of
student leader that should emerge is one who would be able  to  embrace  the
culture of learning and teaching and be disciplined,  both  politically  and
otherwise. He or she should excel academically and be  able  to  uphold  and
respect the code of conduct of a particular school. He  or  she  should  set
the example and arrive early at school, put  on  the  uniform  and  take  up
issues that affect fellow students. He  or  she  should  be  informed  about
political trends, both nationally and internationally. He or she  should  be
a real patriot at heart.

We are saying to the young  people  that  the  picture  of  Hector  Peterson
should be associated with the struggle, which was won with sweat and blood.

Again, we are saying to the students and the  youth  of  South  Africa  that
there is one particular student leader, Siphiwe Mtimkulu, who  was  poisoned
with lithium in prison and eventually disappeared. His  remains  were  found
near the border with Lesotho. We are  saying  that  the  students  of  today
should not forget people such as Siphiwe Mtimkulu.

We are saying, again, that we do not want students to be  martyrs.  All  the
dying, the going to prison, the struggle,  etc.,  has  been  done  on  their
behalf. What we require is the type of youth who will be able to live up  to
the new challenges.

One of the lessons we have learnt as young people is that youth should  also
not fight over positions. They should respect those who lead  them.  I  want
to mention one example of the lessons  we  learnt  in  the  history  of  our
struggle.

I remember that in July 1991, during the conference of  the  ANC  in  Natal,
there were two candidates contesting the position of deputy  president.  The
president's position was not contested, and went to Comrade Nelson  Mandela.
As I have said, there  were  two  candidates  for  the  position  of  deputy
president, Comrade Thabo Mbeki and the late Comrade Chris Hani.

At a later stage Comrade Walter Sisulu came forward and stood  for  election
to the position of deputy president of the organisation. As soon as  Comrade
Thabo Mbeki heard that Comrade Sisulu was contesting the said  position,  he
called Shell House ...

An HON MEMBER: What is your point?

Mr S D MONTSITSI: ... and stated that he was stepping down  as  a  candidate
for the position of deputy president, and did not  contest  it.  When  Chris
Hani heard that  Comrade  Sisulu  was  contesting  the  position  of  deputy
president of the organisation, he also stepped down. Neither  of  them  knew
that the other was going to step down.  They  did  so  out  to  respect  for
Comrade Sisulu, who was regarded as the engine of the  liberation  movement.
[Applause.]

The moral of the story is: Do not  fight  over  positions.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Madam Speaker, ours  is  a  nation  blessed  with  strong,
bright and talented young people. The fact that we  as  a  nation  celebrate
Youth Day is testament to the importance we have attached to the  historical
and future contributions of the young people of our young democracy.

Fundamental and central to the core values of the DA is the enduring  belief
in  the  potential  of  our  nation  and,  indeed,  of  our  continent.  The
cornerstone of this belief is the enormous faith that we have as a party  in
the abilities and aspirations of South Africa's youth.  The  pride  that  we
have in the vitality and the spirit demonstrated by the overwhelming  number
of young people is not diminished  by  the  ill-disciplined  and  scandalous
behaviour of a  tiny  minority,  such  as  the  rampaging  students  of  the
University of the North.

But, inasmuch as we accept that there are unimagined prospects  we  have  in
the abilities of our young South Africans, we need to question the  attitude
shown towards young people by the nation's leadership.  Regrettably,  it  is
not an attitude of confidence, support or conviction.

Too often we hear leading figures bemoan the choices that young people  make
when they exercise their rights as free citizens. All that seems to  emanate
is dissatisfaction with groups such as Bongo Muffin for wanting  to  perform
a kwaito version of the National Anthem. Then there are  those  who  suggest
that talented young people should be silenced because Yizo Yizo brings  home
some truths that they do not want to hear.

These are the voices who arrogantly believe that they have the  monopoly  on
history and morality. In the words of our federal chairperson, the  hon  Joe
Seremane:


  Development should never be used to domesticate  or  indoctrinate  people
  into ideological party conformity, especially in a  fledgling  multiparty
  democracy. Letsema should unify and be based on voluntary participation.

Indeed, we should be listening very carefully to our young people.

We should be  attentive  to  their  needs  and  backing  up  the  platitudes
directed towards them with concrete policies and programmes which  echo  our
faith in them and which go directly with what they say they need.

I have therefore chosen to quote extensively from a survey of  more  than  2
300 South Africans that has just completed. This survey  touches  on  issues
of how young people really feel about their circumstances, about what  their
aspirations really are and about their  vision  of  their  own  future.  But
before doing so, we need to reflect on the  seriousness  we  attach  to  the
issues confronting the youth. I mean we really need to go beyond the  normal
rhetoric and talk. We need to look at what steps and policies we have  taken
as a nation to support the potential of our young  people.  Regrettably,  it
must be said that there is little to show, by way of support, which  we  can
claim when it comes to helping young people. For  this  the  blame  must  ie
squarely at the doorstep of this Government.

By their own measure, young  say  their  Government  has  failed  them.  The
survey shows that 79% of  our  youth  feel  that  their  opportunities  have
worsened since 1994. This Government has even failed in the most modest  and
unambiguous undertakings it has made to address the issues  affecting  young
people. We need only to look at  what  young  people  say  is  the  greatest
challenge that they face, i e unemployment. Sixty percent  of  young  people
feel that Government should be addressing unemployment as  a  top  priority.
This is hardly surprising, considering the 73%  of  those  with  matric  and
post matric who have not been  employed.  What  is  this  Government's  limp
response? The creation of a development fund which, for the last six  years,
remains untapped and unused, as well as the creation of an  inept  resource-
guzzling commission that scarcely touches the lives of the youth.

Both these institutions spend or  plan  to  spend  large  amounts  of  money
supplying youth with information  via  the  Internet.  If  they  would  only
bother to find out. Only 8% of young people have access to the Internet.  It
is, therefore, not surprising that only  15%  of  young  people  know  about
training opportunities that do exist from the private sector, and of  these,
only 2% got the information via Government agencies  such  as  the  National
Youth Commission. In fact,  of  the  150  information  sources  for  support
mentioned in  the  survey,  no  mention  was  made  of  the  National  Youth
Commission or the Umsobomvu Fund.

When asked about their views on crime, the overwhelming  majority  of  those
surveyed rejected crime, but pointed  out  that  there  seemed  to  be  more
opportunities in crime than there are in the job market. It seems that  even
crime syndicate bosses have more faith  in  young  people's  abilities  than
their own Government does. [Interjections.]

Eighty seven percent of the young people surveyed indicated that they  would
be very interested in a Government-sponsored  work  and  skills  development
scheme. They also indicated that they are primarily interested in ones  that
would be market related. Well, the DA once  again  proposes  a  policy  that
will  combine  the  two.  Our  opportunity  vouch  a  policy  rests  on  the
presumption that the youth have the talent and the ability to reach for  the
stars. This is a true measure of faith in the ability of young people.  Only
the DA is willing to back the faith up with at least  R7  billion  over  the
next five years. To  create  4,7  million  career  opportunities  for  young
people is the greatest article of faith any government can  make,  and  ours
is not doing it. We will work tirelessly to find that money  to  fund  this,
because it is an investment we dare not fail to  make.  One  needs  to  make
that investment.

Directly after the issue of unemployment comes the concerns about  security,
especially the crime of rape against young women in our communities.  It  is
distressing to note that 87% of young people feel that  the  crime  of  rape
and child abuse have increased  in  their  communities.  When  asked,  young
women say their communities do not see domestic rape as a  crime,  and  this
needs to be addressed and challenged. It is the duty  of  the  state  to  at
least defend those who depend on them.

On the issue  of  Aids,  it  is  heartening  to  hear  from  another  survey
released, just this week,  that  young  people  are  beginning  to  get  the
message  on  HIV/Aids.  Here,  I  would  like  to   express   my   heartfelt
appreciation to those who have made the Lovelife campaign a success or  made
it work, without whom this would not be possible. Lovelife has achieved  far
more than the state has. Unemployment, violence against our youth  and  Aids
are the greatest obstacles to the realisation of  a  great  future  for  our
country.  This  Government  has  a  responsibility  to  face  up  to   these
challenges honestly, and they do not.

I would like to conclude by once again quoting the hon Seremane:


  Development should begin to eradicating the dependency mentality and  the
  unhealthy culture of entitlement.

By adopting a policy like the opportunity  vouch,  we  are  doing  precisely
that. Only when we express our faith and confidence in our youth  by  giving
them the opportunities they deserve will we be saying  to  them:  ``You  are
our greatest asset and we will do everything in our power to support  you''.

It is very telling that the Minister in the Presidency  who  is  responsible
for youth development has not even bothered to come to this debate. It  just
shows what kind of commitment this  Government  has  to  our  young  people.
[Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Madam Speaker and hon members, there  would  be  no  Letsema
sustainable development debate today if the tree that bore the  fruits  that
we are enjoying today was not nourished by youthful blood on  Wednesday,  16
June 1976. [Applause.]

When I speak about 1976, I am not speaking about what I read or  about  what
I studied: I was there in 1976. I lived in Noordgesig. I went together  with
other youth marching up the hill. When the hippo stopped us  there  on  top,
we were trying to cross to the other side,  marching  on  our  way  to  John
Vorster Square. Some of my friends were killed. I  had  my  friend's  brains
all over me. Therefore, today I can speak of what I know  and  what  I  have
experienced as I stand here today, 26 years later. [Applause.]

When we talk about sustainable development, we are talking about  sustaining
and developing. My friend, Scooter, was lying there, shot to pieces when  we
crossed over to Marabe garage opposite Vukaphantsi. When  they  opened  fire
on all of us and I could not sustain Bonga's breathing, nor could I  develop
him. He has developed no more. He has expired.

However, we still have colleagues like Mr  Aucamp  here  in  Parliament  who
even as late as last year - I have the Hansard of  last  year  here  -  were
still saying, and I quote:


  We cannot join in celebration after the victory at Majuba on 27 February

He went further to say:


  The AEB cannot get frantically excited about 16 June.

Well,  I  do  get  frantically  excited  about  16  June,  because  such   a
politically  mundane  and  intellectually  pedestrian  comment  is   totally
unbefitting for a man of the cross or someone who professes to be a  man  of
the cross.

I am frantic, because such attitudes  fuel  more  Babeiles  at  Vryburg.  It
instructs more rugby players to  brutalise  black  people  and  throw  their
bodies in dams.  Such  attitudes  encourage  more  people  to  paint  others
silver. It motivates more bakkie owners to  drag  black  people  across  tar
roads. Yes, it might just influence some  people  not  only  to  sing  about
`amaIndiya' today, but about ``amabhulu''  tomorrow  and  ``amaboesman''  or
``amabholoman'' on Sunday. [Applause.]

We must innoculate our youth against polarisation, intolerance  and  racism.
We must  vaccinate  them  with  Letsema,  Vukuzenzele  and  Ubuntu  and  the
revolution of goodwill. We have to rejuvenate, regenerate and imbue  African
values, virtues and pride, as well as a common South African patriotism.  We
have to instil respect for our African institutions.

What we find so amazing is that many of our people - and I do  not  mean  to
offend anybody's delicate sensibilities in Europe or  England  -  or  youths
are quick to respectfully refer to ``Prince Charles''  and  ``King  George''
as if their first names are Prince and their surnames,  Charles  or  George.
But they refer to our own kings by their first names  as  Hintsa  or  Shaka.
Our leaders' names are even given to their dogs, and some of  us  even  call
our nkosis ``chiefs'', a colonial expression.  I  do  not  think  we  should
allow it. We should really go back and tell our youth how to behave.

History has delivered unto us a new generation  of  young  people  who  have
emerged from the decades of shadows and naked  state  power,  to  experience
the majestic dignity  of  liberation.  History  has  trusted  upon  them  an
indescribably important destiny to complete a process  of  democractisation,
which is our most powerful weapon for world respect and  emulation.  But  lo
and behold, beware the ides of Aids, beware the ides of poverty, beware  the
ides of unemployment, beware the ides of gangsterism and crime.

We as parliamentarians have a duty entrusted upon us to  be  the  lighthouse
of our youth. We have to take cognisance of what we say to one  another  and
how we say it. We have to ventilate and illuminate pluralism and  diversity,
and yet  prioritise  our  commonness  as  South  Africans,  irrespective  of
idealogical adherences. We as statesmen have to be honest in our  quest  for
a better life for all, and not just certain sections,  certain  friends  and
so forth. We must be flagships of reconciliation and tolerance right here.

It is important for us to graduate to  political  maturity  and  objectively
examine how the laws we make impact on the  youth,  because  some  of  these
freedoms are misinterpreted by  the  young  as  carte  blanche  tickets  for
immorality and resistance. Some parents complain and  say,  ``We  are  being
overgoverned right in our own houses. We have no governance  in  our  houses
anymore, because as soon as I want to reprimand my child ...

... die kind sê vir my ... [... the child says to me ...]
... ``You touch me and I will have you arrested for child abuse''. They  are
misinterpreting it and at the end of the day this  whole  degradation  takes
place right inside our houses.

We should be clear about messages that  we  send  out  about  our  coalition
Government here - I am talking about the ANC and the IFP. Our  youth  should
know about our commitments and undertakings. They should know about the ten-
a-side or fifteen-a-side meetings and what they intend to achieve for  their
futures. Not for our parties' sake, not for  our  purposes,  but  for  their
futures, their dreams and their ambitions. We  should  be  lighthouses  that
guide our  children's  ships  of  aspirations  and  opportunities  to  safer
harbours.

We dare not have double agendas. We dare not  shock  their  expectations  or
disappoint them, otherwise history shall condemn us to what Arden once  said
to Chamberlain. They will be justified if they say the following to  us  for
shocking those expectations, and I quote:


  You have sat too long in this parliament when it was  no  longer  fit  to
  conduct the affairs of the nation. You have sat so long for any good  you
  have been doing. In the name of God, go.

[Applause.]

Please allow me to devote some time to the effects  of  gangsterism  on  the
youth in the Western Cape. We have youths from all over in the Western  Cape
in the gallery, and they are affected by gangsterism  and  crime.  They  are
right here with us today. [Applause.]  They  are  refugees,  physically  and
psychologically wounded or maimed. If one looks at the newspaper  clippings,
one reads: ``Gangs turns school into war zone''; ``Gang this,  gang  that'';
and ``Velencia Farmer this and that'', one can go  on  and  on.  ``Plea  for
peace'', another one says. Why should we plead for peace  when  there  is  a
Government which has to look after our people? [Applause.]

The approach that we as Government should have should not only be a law  and
order  one.  We  are  talking  about  ``Operation   Slasher'';   ``Operation
Gangbust'' and operation this and operation that, yet the problem  prevails.
Our people are dying. The youth do not even reach 21 years of  age,  because
they are dying in the townships. They get shot. Do  hon  members  know  that
there are people who hire guns as members hire cars?  They  hire  guns,  pay
the money, go and shoot the people and then take  the  gun  back.   That  is
taking place in the township, right under our  noses  here  in  the  Western
Cape. [Interjections.]

A further perception - especially amongst the  coloured  community  -  which
plays a major role as a  motivational  and  causal  factor  to  keep  people
involved in gang activities, ie the need for protection and defence  by  the
majority of residents due to poor policing, should not be underestimated.

South Africa is remarkably equipped  to  deal  with  many  of  the  problems
resulting  from  gang  activities.  It  possesses  the  best   intelligence-
gathering agencies in sub-saharan Africa. Unfortunately,  legislation  alone
will not be able to deal with the problem of gangs.  What  is  needed  is  a
holistic approach, socioeconomic development, community  development  and  a
crime  prevention  plan.  History  has  shown  that   the   battle   against
gangsterism is also a battle of ideas and resources.

If the hearts and minds of the Western Cape communities cannot  be  diverted
from a selective criminal morality to a more inclusive and caring one,  then
gangs will succeed in winning  the  marginalised  communities.  We  have  to
create a synergy between the commmunities, between  all  of  us,  to  get  a
chemistry that will become a prognosis for victory for  all  of  us  in  the
end. [Applause.]

Ms H M MPAKA: Madam Speaker, hon members, the  youth  of  South  Africa  has
historically been at the centre of the struggle for democracy.  It  was  the
youth, under the leadership of,  amongst  others,  Comrades  Anton  Lembede,
Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela and many others,  who  pioneered
the  role  of  youth  in  the  South  African  struggle  for  democracy  and
transformation.
It was almost 26 years ago when the youth of  this  country  embarked  on  a
struggle to demand freedom, and a just and qualitative education system.  In
this way, they  acted  in  a  manner  that  demonstrated  that  the  youth's
interests were inseparable from those of their people as a  whole.  In  what
was supposed to be a peaceful march in  solidarity  with  the  Orlando  West
Form 2 class, the racist apartheid regime responded with live ammunition  to
unarmed and  defenceless  youth.  Many  lives  were  lost.  This  month,  we
commemorate the lives of those who passed away and further  celebrate  their
contribution  in  the  struggle  for  nonracism,  nonsexism,  democracy  and
prosperity for all.

I am standing here today on behalf of the ANC  to  encourage  the  youth  of
this country who participated in the struggle. Today, we disclaim the  label
of ``a lost generation''. Today, we want to tell the country that we  are  a
generation that brought about freedom to our country; made it  possible  for
the new South Africa  to  re-enter  the  community  of  the  world  nations;
through our blood, paved the way for South African  business  to  enter  the
African continent; and made it possible for the South  African  business  to
enter global markets,  not  as  thieves  in  the  night  but  as  honourable
businessmen and women.

Therefore, June 16, to us,  is  a  continuous  reminder  that  there  is  no
collective freedom without the combined action of the  collective.  June  16
is  a  reminder  about  self-sacrifice  which  was  the   prerequisite   for
participation in freeing our country from oppression,  hunger  and  poverty.
In hindsight, June 16 informs us that such sacrifice cannot be  in  vain  if
it involves the combined efforts of a nation,  as  the  events  of  June  16
themselves contributed to the 1994 democratic breakthrough.

As it will be Youth Day on Sunday, we must take this time to  emphasize  the
need to integrate the youth into the mainstream economic activities  of  our
country. I would like to commend the ANC Youth League for leading the  march
to Safcoc not to demand hand-outs but the right to earn our living, and  not
as enemies of business but as partners. We, as the ANC in government,  fully
understand and urge our partners in business to embrace the  fact  that  the
economy can only thrive in a thriving youth, and the youth can  only  thrive
in a thriving economy; and that both of us, as partners,  should  take  full
responsibility for economic stability and growth in our country.

The late Comrade O R Tambo, said and I quote:


  A nation that does not value its youth does not deserve a future.

I must remind this House that we  are  not  a  lost  generation.  We  are  a
generation which is destined to build a firm foundation for  a  better  life
for all.  Together,  we  should  find  creative  ways  to  create  more  job
opportunities, on a sustainable basis.

We support the work  that  the  Government  has  done  in  establishing  the
Umsobomvu Youth Fund as a vehicle for youth economic  development.  However,
Government needs to further enhance  this  initiative  through  legislation,
policies and programmes in order to ensure the  realisation  of  its  goals.
We, South Africans, need to urgently  demolish  the  walls  of  the  digital
divide between the North and South and between black and white. That, is  in
the best interest of the South African youth.

Let us invest in our youth. We want the youth to contribute to  our  economy
and to be conscious actors in the economy. That, is in the best interest  of
South Africa. Wealth  should  not  be  synonymous  with  a  particular  skin
colour. The Government is correct in taking special measures to ensure  that
the South African economy is completely deracialised.

The ANC Youth League continues to lead  the  youth  on  volunteer  work  and
shall  ensure  that  the  youth  participates  in  the  World   Summit   for
Sustainable Development. The national youth service has  the  potential  not
only of accommodating the youth of our country, but also of contributing  to
the infrastructure  development  of  our  country,  thus  further  enhancing
grounds for investment. As we have insisted, Government must further  ensure
that the ground is made fertile for  the  mushrooming  of  the  business  of
youth. Support for local entrepreneurial activities should  be  effected  by
Government departments.

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the ANC Youth  League,  together
with various Government departments, for having  been  able  to  launch  the
South African youth volunteer movement which  aims  at  encouraging  people,
particularly  the  youth,  to  avail  their  voluntary  services   for   the
reconstruction of the country and the  entire  African  continent,  and  for
rebuilding our societies.

As we celebrate the noble struggle of the youth of South Africa,  we  should
also  note  our  support  for  the  youth  of  Western  Sahara,   Swaziland,
Palestine, Sudan and other areas who are fighting for freedom,  justice  and
democracy. We continue to firmly  uphold  the  belief  that  peace  for  the
people of Israel depends upon peace for the people of Palestine.

As we pay tribute to the valiant youth of  1976,  we  must  also  lower  our
banners in solemn homage to the great African titans and  illuminators,  Oom
Govan Mbeki, Joe Modise, Steve Tshwete, Curnick Ndlovu and many others.  The
injunction of their lives is that we should,  ourselves,  never  betray  the
cause of freedom and that once freedom is attained, we should never take  it
for granted. It is precisely because of this profound  respect  for  freedom
that President Mbeki today launched the Freedom Park as fitting  tribute  to
the youth of South Africa who fought so much and  paid  so  dearly  for  our
freedom.

The struggle to deepen  our  revolution  shall  produce  more  heroines  and
heroes and we,  the  current  generation,  shall  not  let  down  those  who
sacrificed their lives for freedom. Aluta, continua! [Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Speaker, my speech begins  with  a  salutation  to  the
members of Cabinet and colleagues, but I do not see any members  of  Cabinet
here today. I suppose that that could be indicative of the seriousness  with
which the topic is taken by certain members of this House - if one looks  at
the attendance level.

True to  biblical  and  other  prophecies,  the  key  organisations  of  the
international community have come to believe that  the  greatest  threat  to
world security will arise out of the poverty-stricken people.  The  struggle
for the socioeconomic freedom of the world's poorest  will  undoubtedly,  as
history has proven, be led  by  the  youth,  especially  the  youth  of  the
southern developing nations. I am sure that  the  youth  delegates  who  are
attending the SADC youth parliament, which is being held in  Kimberley  this
week, would agree that our region's youth are some of the most  marginalised
and disempowered in the developing world, especially the youth of  Zimbabwe,
Angola and the DRC.

There seems to be little ubuntu. The call to  us  to  adopt  the  spirit  of
vuk'uzenzele and engage in action through letsema, would be a shout  in  the
dark unless we,  all  of  us  amongst  both  the  governing  and  opposition
parties, deliver more tangibles more rapidly, especially to  our  youth  and
through  our  youth.  The  national  youth  service  initiative   has   that
potential. We  must  do  everything  in  our  power  to  embrace  its  sound
objectives and make it work.

Last week, the National Youth Commission took a couple of young people on  a
nationwide road show to  promote  the  national  youth  service  initiative.
Could this event mark the start of a process that  enlists  this  generation
of the youth to struggle nonviolently for their socioeconomic  freedom  with
as much passion as the  previous  generation  was  forced  to  volunteer  to
violently struggle for our political  freedom?  Whilst  this  generation  of
youth are at that, will they see and eat the fruit of the struggle in  their
lifetime? Will they have reason to vote for any of us in the next  election?
Only we have the answers to these questions. Only we  have  the  ability  to
ensure that the youth of our various constituencies actively participate  in
the national youth service initiative.

Participating youth will be given the opportunity to have hands-on  training
and the practical experience that they acquire will  be  accredited  through
the national qualifications authority. This would position them to  be  more
employable, if and when jobs become more available. But,  more  importantly,
the national youth service will give them a greater  sense  of  purpose  and
self-esteem which will go beyond the hero  worship  of  gangsters  and  even
certain pop idols who promote the moral degeneration of our youth.

Some great opportunities for national  service  have  presented  themselves,
recently. These include the registration of people who qualify for  the  new
social welfare grant scheme; volunteers in the prevention and  treatment  of
victims of HIV/Aids;  the  maintenance  and  repair  of  schools  and  other
community facilities; participation in community police forums  through  the
youth liaison against crime campaign; and the volunteers who are  now  being
trained for the World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  amongst  other
things.

Yet, there have also been some wasted opportunities where some  youth  have,
of their own volition, not acted in the  best  interests  of  their  future.
Certain  learners  at  certain  schools  and  campuses  are   allowing   the
perpetrators of gangsterism,  drug  trafficking,  sexual  abuse,  arson  and
vandalism to get away with the destruction of their futures. The Task  Group
on Sexual Abuse of Children heard during  the  public  hearings  about  many
more opportunities where the youth can and must  volunteer  their  services.
We will debate that in more detail later on this month.

However, let me not sound like a prophet of doom, since we have a lot to  be
positive about. We should be positive beyond hope, though. It has taken  the
deaths of the youthful Hansie Cronje and Peter Mokaba for us to  reflect  on
what they had struggled for and what they had achieved in their  short  time
with us - warts and all. We must be big enough  to  genuinely  salute  these
two sons of our nation, forgive them for any  of  their  transgressions  and
celebrate their voluntary  contributions  to  the  successes  that  we  have
achieved thus far as a nation.

It has taken Mark Shuttleworth's self-funded first African in space  project
to prove to many young people of our nation, once again, that they can  rise
above their station in life and achieve their  dreams.  But,  only  if  they
plan, persevere and maintain those dreams. Only now do we realise that  this
journey was not simply an exercise in  self-gratification  but  a  voluntary
opportunity taken with considerably less means than Government  has  at  its
disposal to propel the youth of our nation in  pursuit  of  educational  and
business excellence. The momentum of this project needs  to  be  boosted  by
the  considerable  funds  still  locked  in  the  national   youth   service
initiative and Umsobomvu Youth Fund.

The sporting  excellence  and  successes  of  our  national  sports  heroes,
including the victories and  losses,  would  not  be  possible  without  the
sports volunteers who are the driving force behind our sports  at  club  and
school levels. We take this opportunity to salute them  too.  To  all  those
volunteers, young and old, we are ask them to lay down their tools on  Youth
Day, this Sunday, and enjoy the celebrations as it will not be our age  that
we will be celebrating but the youthful spirit of our nation. [Applause.]

Ms  ANNELIZÉ  VAN  WYK:  Madam  Speaker,  this  debate  forms  part  of  our
commemoration of national Youth Day which falls on Sunday  16  June.  As  we
honour the many contributions made by young people  through  many  years  of
struggle, one thing  becomes  very  clear:  Young  people,  then,  played  a
leading role and they continue to do so today through  taking  on  the  many
challenges that face our country. Hector Peterson paid  the  ultimate  price
for freedom. Till today, he remains an inspiration to  many.  Nkosi  Johnson
paid that same price in the fight against Aids and, in  years  to  come,  he
will remain an inspiration to many.

Letsema is not a new innovation by President Mbeki or the ANC. It  has  been
inherent in our people since the dawn  of  time.  It  is  that  spirit  that
carried our people through difficult times in our history. It is present  in
all our communities and amongst all our people. The UDM  believes  that  all
South Africans carry the shared responsibility and collective commitment  to
improve our country, her people and society as  a  whole.  It  is  for  that
reason that we went into the 1999 elections  asking  South  Africans  to  do
what is best for South Africa.

This is our approach in our participation in this House as well. We  support
what we believe is in the best interest of our country and our people  as  a
collective. Members might learn something today if they could just take  the
trouble to listen.

The UDM believes that our youth is our future. It is them who will  take  up
the position of leadership tomorrow. The question that  we  should  ask  is,
what kind of tomorrow are we creating for our youth? Is it a tomorrow  where
children are raped, are hungry and cold because of high umemployment? Is  it
a  tomorrow  where,  despite  our  hard-fought  freedom,  they  will  become
prisoners of their circumstances?  I  believe  that  the  answer  is  no.  I
believe that our young people have the spirit, the ability and the  will  to
rise to the top and become the best.

What do we need to do? What can we do? We need to  equip  our  young  people
with  the  necessary  skills  required  in  order  for  them  to  enter  the
competitive technological arena. We must  equip  our  youth  with  a  strong
educational basis and good health services. We must  also  encourage  skills
development in every sector of our society.

Last year, in the debate on the June 16  commemorations,  I  asked  Minister
Asmal to look at the possibility of introducing into our  schools  curricula
a citizenry programme. Our young people need to be actively made  aware  not
only of  their  rights  as  citizens,  but  also  the  responsibilities  and
obligations that come with this privilege. This programme  should  not  only
inform, but should establish loyalty, pride and commitment  to  our  country
and to fellow citizens.

We talk about moral regeneration. The greatest possibility for  the  success
of moral regeneration is to establish it in today's youth, to make it a  way
of living for them. They are tomorrow adults. Government  has  the  ultimate
responsibility  to  create  an  environment  that  will  be   conducive   to
sustainable development. If the Government is serious about the  sustainable
development of our youth, they should urgently address those  issues  facing
our youth. These are crime, unemployment and Aids. Special emphasis need  to
be placed on youth crime education. We need to encourage  the  youth  to  be
more safety conscious. Faced  with  large-scale  poverty  and  unemployment,
many of our young people the sad and  ultimately  destructive  choice  of  a
life in crime.

The UDM's call to the Government is to abandon its segregated  approach  and
address urgently and holistically the issue of sustainable  development  for
our youth. I urge our youth to take on the  challenge.  They  should  become
the best they can be, seize every opportunity and show their commitment  for
South Africa and its people, their people, through the  choices  they  make,
the deeds they do and the words they speak.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker and hon members, I wish to  dedicate  my  speech
to the members of Sasvo, the SA Students Volunteers. About four  weeks  ago,
I was privileged to attend a regional conference in  Pretoria  organised  by
Volunteer Vision and there  I  met  the  representatives  of  Sasco.  I  was
intrigued  by  this  student  organisation  because  of   their   consistent
contribution to sustainable development. As  members  can  see,  I  actually
managed to get some pamphlets from this  organisation.  Unlike  the  student
organisations that are often promoted by  the  media,  where  we  often  see
violence, marches and so on, this organisation does not  do  this.  On  this
pamphlet one can  see  hard  working  students  busy  digging  trenches  and
helping to build houses.

Sasvo was established in 1993 to involve students in  volunteer  development
work  in  the  region.  Society  at  large  benefits  greatly  through  this
organisation, because it promotes  the  concept  of  volunteerism.  It  also
fosters self-reliance, pride, the  values  of  hard  work,  care  for  one's
community, the love for Africa and  links  between  people  which  transcend
national borders. The good work done by Sasvo is seldom  recognised  by  the
media,  because  it  is  not  sensational  enough.  The  quiet   unassuming,
constructive voluntary work done by students in Sasvo is in  sharp  contrast
to the recent destruction of the University of the  North  and  the  violent
march of Cosa.

The youth will lose its sense of unworthiness if it is engaged in  works  of
value. Sustainable development can achieve this goal if it  rids  itself  of
obscure policy objectives. We need  to  involve  our  youth  in  sustainable
projects that are measurable and achievable, such as what  is  happening  in
Sasvo.

Mr  Z  KOTWAL:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members  of  the  House,  the  African
Renaissance  project  -  which  should  allow  our  country  and  continent,
plundered for centuries, to take its rightful place in the world  -  depends
on the building of a strong and  competitive  economy  as  the  world  moves
towards greater liberalisation and competition.

The New Partnership for Africa's  Development,  Nepad,  will  be  successful
only if it is owned by  the  African  people,  united  in  their  diversity.
Africa, impoverished by slavery, corruption and economic  mismanagement,  is
taking off in a difficult situation. However, if her  enormous  natural  and
human resources are properly  harnessed  and  utilised,  it  could  lead  to
equitable and sustainable growth of the continent.  It  could  also  enhance
its rapid integration into the world economy.

What South Africa and all developing countries  need  is  real  development.
This development should finally eradicate poverty and  illiteracy,  as  well
as put an end to hunger and poverty-related diseases. This  is  the  message
of the ANC in our RDP. Our commitment to these goals is stronger than  ever,
We do not confine our commitment to our country: we are  part  of  a  larger
continent and are determined to fight against underdevelopment and  poverty,
wherever it occurs.

Of course, we do not want this development to be  of  a  short-term  nature.
Development is not about temporary poverty relief or short term  programmes.
Our development strategies  and  approaches  must  be  designed  to  achieve
sustainable development. This implies that  our  planet's  scarce  resources
are respected  and  cared  for.  Our  strategies  must  include  sustainable
resource use. What mother  nature  offers  us  must  be  respected  and  the
benefits must extend to al,l not just a privileged few.

The quest for development can therefore not be separate  from  the  struggle
for equality. Sustainable development should be relevant to  the  agenda  of
the developing countries. We should focus on  poverty  eradication  and  put
the interests of future generations at the forefront of  development.  As  a
prerequisite, we need to aggressively mobilise the heads  of  government  in
Africa and other senior leaders on the continent in  profiling  huge  issues
within the sustainable development context.

There is a need for greater youth involvement at a  national,  regional  and
local level. There is a need to continue lobbying  high-level  support  from
Government. We need to ensure that huge issues are always at the  centre  of
the development agenda. There is a need for a greater  involvement  in  mass
media, continuous briefing, radio, TV and Youth competitions.  This  is  why
our youth, in spite of  present  difficulties,  must  regain  confidence  in
their genius and their capacity to face obstacles and  be  involved  in  the
building of our new dispensation.

But the struggle they will be waging will be successful if and only  if  our
youth are the masters of  their  own  destiny.  Our  youth  are  our  future
leaders. They have to be prepared, enlightened, educated  and  ambitious  to
be able to build a sound and resilient economy  and  a  democratic  society.
Above all, they must be patriotic and have a love for their country.

UHulumeni  kaKhongolse  oholwa  nguMongameli  uThabo  Mbeki  uveza  amathuba
kubantu basemakhaya okuthi bangene emabhizinisini.  Lo  Hulumeni  wethu  uze

[The ANC Government,  which  is  led  by  President  Mbeki,  is  opening  up
business opportunities for rural people. This Government of  ours  has  come
up  with  programmes  such  as  affirmative  action   and   black   economic
empowerment. To those who do not have money the Government's answer  is  the
Khula scheme. All banks are working together with  the  Government  in  this
Khula scheme. Regarding rural people, the Government has tried to  introduce
changes to the Land Bank in order to  enable  our  people  to  borrow  money
easily in order to buy farms,  plant  crops,  breed  livestock  and  make  a
living. Those things will make their life better. Amandla!

HON MEMBERS: Awethu! [Applause.]

Mr Z KOTWAL: In accordance with the  Vukuzenzele  spirit,  as  the  ANC,  we
would like to urge our youth to use these  opportunities.  We  would  really
like to appeal to the youth to wake up. If we want to develop  our  country,
we should have the means of ensuring that the youth help  us  develop  South
Africa and Africa as a whole. When I say that they should help  us,  I  mean
that the youth should assist by checking whether hospitals and clinics  work
properly. They should represent the community through health committees.

Another area in which they can lend  a  hand  is  in  helping  police  catch
criminals, killers and rapists because the criminals live  with  us  and  we
know who they are. That is why it is  necessary  for  us  to  become  police
informers so that we can defeat the criminals. These  criminals  steal  from
us and are troublesome. The police cannot protect us if we  do  not  protect
ourselves. Those criminals taint the reputation  of  this  Government.  Away
with criminality, away!

HON MEMBERS: Away!

Mr Z KOTWAL: Wake up, youth, wake up!

HON MEMBERS: Wake up!
Mr Z KOTWAL: I urge the youth to wake up, join CPFs and  help  defend  their
Government. Our grandmothers and great-grandmothers suffer a lot  when  they
are old. We appeal to the youth to assist them when they go to register  for
pension grants. We also appeal to members to protect them when they  are  on
their way to collect grants. Because criminals confront them along the  way,
it is therefore necessary that members should accompany them.

Under the Letsema programme the Driefontein youth,  in  Mpumalanga,  removed
refuse from the streets, cut grass at clinics and assisted the elderly  when
they went to  collect  their  pension  grants.  I  challenge  others  to  do
likewise.]

Minder as tien jaar gelede was dit vir ons jongmense 'n vreemde ervaring  om
as swart, wit en bruin langs mekaar op die skoolbanke te sit. Vandag is  dit
eerder die norm as die uitsondering. Dit is wonderlik om te sien hoe wit  en
swart saam op die sportveld meeding. Miskien is daar nog 'n meerderheid  wit
spelers  op  die  rugbyvelde  en  'n  meerderheid  swart  spelers   op   die
sokkervelde. Dit sal ook met tyd  regkom.  Daar  is  sekerlik  nie  een  wat
verlede week tydens Hansie Cronjé se begrafnis geraak is toe  die  orkes  en
koor bestaande uit wit en swart skoliere, 'n treffende  bydrae  gelewer  het
nie. Met die ongelukkige uitsonderings, sien die meerderheid  jongmense  nie
meer kleur nie. Hulle sien mekaar as medemense wat saam  bou  aan  die  nuwe
Suid-Afrika. Met so 'n gesindheid  sal  ons  'n  wennasie  bou.  Viva  Suid-
Afrika!  Viva!  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[Less than 10 years ago it was, to us young people, a strange experience  as
black, white and brown to sit next to one another  on  the  school  benches.
Today it is more the norm then the exception. It is  wonderful  to  see  how
white and black compete together on the  sports  field.  There  may  perhaps
still be a majority white players on the rugby fields and a  majority  black
players on the soccer fields. This will also be rectified in time. There  is
certainly no one who was not affected last week at Hansie  Cronje's  funeral
when the orchestra and choir consisting of white and black scholars  made  a
touching contribution. With the unfortunate exceptions the majority  of  the
youth no longer see colour. They see one  another  as  fellow  human  beings
building together on the new South Africa. With such an  attitude  we  shall
build a winning nation. Viva, South Africa! Viva! [Interjections.]]

In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the youth of  our
country for the struggle they endured to ensure that today in this House  we
are able to debate across the colour line. I also want  to  thank  them  for
what they did, so that our children can be safe today, able to go to  school
and to eat well, looking forward to a better South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, the youth put a  gallant  fight  against
an unjust system and sacrificed their  education,  in  quest  for  a  better
education for the next generation. There is no doubt that they have  laid  a
solid foundation for today's youth.  Therefore,  it  is  not  by  chance  or
mistake that June is a month that is dedicated to our youth,  especially  16
June, which has become a special day on our  calendar.  To  our  heroes  and
heroines, we say that we are proud of them and it shall forever remain  like
that!

However, the biggest challenge facing today's youth is to  carry  forward  a
different type of struggle, compared to  the  pre-democracy  youth  of  1976
generation, because then  their  enemy  was  clearly  defined.  Hence  their
struggle was not based on pursuing a particular  political  party  ideology,
but simply defeating the system as united South Africans.

The current reality  is  that  the  country's  political  and  socioeconomic
environment has completely changed. We  have  all  realised  that  democracy
alone cannot bring about  meaningful  freedom.  Our  youth,  similarly,  are
facing a multitude of powerful  enemies  ranging  from  HIV/Aids  to  rising
unemployment, poverty, homelessness and lack of education.

Do we have robust political institutions that  are  geared  towards  meeting
our youth's needs, such as youth business and  employment  centres?  In  the
same breath, we need to acknowledge that positive  initiatives  directed  at
our youth are undertaken. What is important is that such  projects  need  to
be speeded up.

What the youths are asking is not handouts from Government and  the  private
sector,  but  a  workable  partnership  that  would  enable  us  to  achieve
sustainable  development.  It  is  a  relationship  that   appreciates   the
weaknesses and strengths of each partner, resulting in the complementing  of
each other to form a winning team.

The Government can initiate  long-  and  short-term,  value-adding  projects
aimed at giving our youth a kick-start in life. Their active involvement  in
the economy will, no doubt, lead  to  the  sustainable  development  of  our
country. The economy will grow, meaning more  revenue  for  the  Government,
and better social services for all. [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, we commemorate 16 June 1976. We  remember  the
youth, because of their sacrifice - the blood that they shed.

A nation that does not remember its dead is not alive -  it  is  dead.  This
weekend we shall be seeing 16 June commemorated in ghetto style,  with  each
political formation actually commemorating the day. I believe that  this  is
a shame. Young people must unite this nation. With the old  people  divided,
it is the duty of young people to unite this nation.

I want to recall Peter Mokaba, who will be buried this weekend. I met  Peter
one day at the airport. He had a very heavy  heart.  He  had  just  returned
from Kenya. He said: ``I am very  sad'',  and  I  said,  ``Why?''  He  said:
``Kenya is being recolonised. There are international  NGO  that  have  come
back to buy the land, and they own whole suburbs in Kenya.''  He  said  that
unless we united, it would happen here as well. I want to  bring  his  words
back to this House, because I believe we should remember them.

Soweto 1976 must be remembered, because the lesson  we  learnt  from  it  is
that freedom does not come easy. If we need freedom, we must work  hard.  We
must remember education, because it was because  of  education  that  Soweto
1976 happened. We must also remember unemployment  and  HIV/Aids,  the  main
problems that we have today.

I believe that as we commemorate Soweto 1976, we must think  of  the  heroes
of  that  era.  I  remember  Hector  Petersen,  Tsietsi  Mashinini,   Sydney
Maphalala,  Magauta  Molefe,  George  Wauchope,  Hlako  Rachidi,  Thandaziwe
Mazibuko, Thomas Manthata, etc - real leaders who have led this nation.

I want to say: Forward, Soweto 1976!  May  we  be  united!  May  that  never
happen again! [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, even though they say  that  life  begins  at
40, if one thinks like youths, one will always be a youth. [Laughter.]

President Thabo Mbeki, in his state of the nation address in February  2001,
admirably said, and I quote:


  As we strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity with  our  fellow
  Africans, we have an obligation to help ensure that in  our  country  and
  everywhere else on our continent, no African child should ever again walk
  in fear of guns, tyrants and abuse; that no  African  child  should  ever
  again experience hunger, avoidable disease and ignorance; that no African
  child should ever again feel ashamed to be an African.

These words were spoken in  the  true  spirit  of  dedication,  and  the  MF
salutes the hon the President. As the future  leaders  of  our  nation,  our
youth should be socialised into the values and morals of  African  societies
that make us the harmonious rainbow nation that we so proudly boast of.

The MF is encouraged by the many  projects  and  initiatives  taken  by  the
Government, the public and many other role-players out of  concern  for  the
children of our nation. I  think  we  as  MPs  should  all  be  doing  that.
Protection from harm, freedom to be a child and enhanced growth to become  a
strong nation with good leaders and good people should be our central  focus
in the interest of our young ones.

It has been said that the best way to see the world is through the  eyes  of
a child. It is important for us to respect the vision  of  our  young  under
aspects  like  civil  society,  human  rights,  labour,   development,   the
environment, gender, health and education. These  are  aspects  that  affect
their lives  whereby  our  input  could  prevent  their  abuse.  The  MF  is
confident that together we can make a difference for the future.

While keeping in mind our youths, let us not  forget  the  fathers.  Let  me
take this opportunity to wish all fathers a happy Fathers Day  on  16  June.
[Applause.] Fathers are fortunate in that 16 June and Fathers  Day  fall  on
the same day. Fathers should give their children love and affection on  that
day.

Fathers Day and Youth Day are celebrated on the same  day,  so  the  fathers
should make this day a day  to  remember,  for  it  might  not  come  again.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I must say that I am not quite certain of why there  was
no loud applause from the males on this side! [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Ms M C LOBE: Madam Speaker, 26 years ago young people took  to  the  streets
in protest against Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in  public  schools.
I think the hon member has  forgotten  that  point.  This  protest  was,  in
essence, a challenge to authorities to scrap apartheid. The response of  the
NP government at the time was to issue shoot-to-kill orders to the  security
forces. This resulted in  the  brutal  death  of  peaceful  protesters,  and
hundreds were injured. Thirteen-year-old Hector Petersen  became  the  first
victim of that gruesome response.
As we salute these extraordinary volunteers, who understood that  the  price
for freedom and justice was life itself, I would like to join the nation  in
paying tribute to the  fallen  hero  of  South  Africa  and  the  continent,
Comrade Peter Mokaba, who was a comrade, a brother and a mentor  to  me.  No
doubt, the youth of this country suffered most with the  untimely  departure
of this tiger of our revolution. In the same breath, we are shocked  by  the
loss of Comrade Sibusiso Zuma, a member of the  ANC  Youth  League  National
Executive Committee and its National Working Committee.

Ke rata ho fetisa matshediso le kutlwelobohloko ho ba  leloko  le  metswalle
ya bahlabani bana. Ke re phephi, feela leqeba  la  lona  ke  leqeba  la  ka.
Tsebang hoba lefu ke ngwetsi ya malapa oohle. [I would  like  to  convey  my
condolences to the family and friends of these fallen  soldiers.  I  say  be
strong, your pain is mine. Remember that death happens to everybody.]

As we celebrate  the  lives  of  these  young  fighters,  we  recognise  the
enormous role played by the youth in the struggle  for  liberation.  It  was
the youth, amongst  others  Anton  Lembede,  Walter  Sisulu,  Oliver  Tambo,
Nelson Mandela and many more, who pioneered the dynamic role  of  the  youth
in the national democratic revolution. Consequently,  these  radical  youths
led, through their militant actions, the defiance  campaign  of  the  1950s.
Decades later, the students of the  1970s  -  the  likes  of  Comrade  Peter
Mokaba - further demonstrated that  self-sacrifice  was  necessary  for  the
liberation of the oppressed masses.

The date of 16 June therefore represents  for  us  an  intervention  by  the
South African youth to reclaim their birthright,  the  birthright  of  their
people. The day represents a  sacrosanct  and  noble  revolutionary  act  to
renounce colonialism and reassert our humanity. This that we commemorate  is
therefore more than a pilgrimage to the shrine. It is a celebration  of  the
colossal voluntary sacrifice  of  our  people  as  they  struggled  to  free
themselves from the bondages of oppression  and  get  onto  the  pathway  to
emancipation.

The 16 June therefore inspires us as young people to volunteer ourselves  to
contribute immensely to the reconstruction and development  of  our  country
and continent.  In  doing  so,  we  seek  to  launch  an  offensive  on  all
stereotypes about youths. We are interested  in  addressing,  in  words  and
deeds,  some  of  the  negligent  statements  we  have  heard  here   today:
statements such as ``the youth are apathetic, disinterested,  disaffected'',
and so forth. We seek to highlight, for  all  to  acknowledge,  the  immense
innovation and creativity of the South African youth in the fields of  sport
- let me take this  opportunity  to  congratulate  Bafana  Bafana  on  their
unbelievable performance in the World Cup 2002  -  business,  arts,  culture
and politics.

Ours being the last generation of youth  to  be  involved  in  the  struggle
against apartheid, we are burdened with the responsibility  to  link  future
generations with their nation's past. This is so that they understand  fully
the task we had  to  embark  upon  to  free  their  country  and  provide  a
foundation upon which to build a new society. The 16  June  is  therefore  a
reminder to the South African youth today to emulate  examples  set  by  the
generation of Lembede, Mandela, Sisulu and Tambo, as well as the  generation
of 1976 and others, that self-sacrifice is a prerequisite for  participation
in freeing our country from oppression, poverty and hunger.

The first call made by the first President of  a  free  Tanganyika,  Comrade
Rashidi Kawawa,  to  his  people,  was  directed  at  the  youth  to  assume
responsibility and  engage  rural  communities  in  respect  of  illiteracy,
agriculture, health, etc. He urged the youth to serve  the  deprived  people
of Tanganyika, as that was the only way to  defend  their  revolution.  This
was, amongst other  things,  what  led  Julius  Nyerere,  the  President  of
Tanganyika - later renamed Tanzania - to introduce a concept of  ``ujamaa'',
which meant the reconstruction and revival  of  the  African  spirit  for  a
better life for all.

Hon members will, therefore, realise that a better life for  all  is  not  a
new concept: it was there  even  in  those  difficult  times.  Just  as  the
enemies  of  freedom  in  South  Africa  described  the  struggle  as  being
communist, so did the enemies of ujamaa.

The ANC Youth League, in its basic policy document  of  1948,  aimed,  among
other things, to study  the  political,  economic  and  social  problems  of
Africa and the world. Fully conscious of all the problems that  still  beset
our continent, we firmly believe  that  these  are  African  problems  which
should be solved by the Africans themselves.

Central to the current conjuncture's development  is  Nepad,  which  is  our
historic blueprint to consolidate the African  Renaissance.  Nepad  holds  a
lot of developmental and  economic  potential  for  all  countries  in  this
continent.  Obviously,  the  youth  will  play  an  important  role  in  the
realisation of this important  project.  Re  re  Afrika,  ke  nako  [We  say
Africa, now is the time]!

As a country, we have no option but to move from a premise  that  the  youth
are a major human resource which should be developed and  utilised  for  the
future prospects of this country in  the  fundamental  social  and  economic
transformation agenda. For a country like South Africa, which  has  provided
a space for the youth in its democratic processes  through  legislative  and
other measures, this should be a logical starting point.

The previous and current  financial  year's  Budget  prioritised  integrated
development, with a conscious attention to the rural  and  vulnerable  urban
areas. The Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme and the  Urban
Renewal  Programme  are  projected  to  top  the  developmental  agenda   of
Government over the MTEF period.

On its 21st National  Congress  in  2001,  the  ANCYL  resolved  to  network
closely with  NGOs  and  CBOs  to  get  involved  with  units  that  support
Integrated Rural Development initiatives, to explore the establishment of  a
youth or village bank as an initiative for financing rural  development.  In
my view, this was a very  significant  and  responsible  resolution  by  the
youth that needs to be taken forward to be realised. This resolution  is  in
line with the objectives of the Letsema/Ilima campaign.  The  youth  already
had concrete plans to lend a hand in pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

The involvement and participation of the youth  is  vital  and  critical  at
municipal level, because of the complex and  technical  nature  of  the  new
legislative framework that seeks to implement the concept  of  developmental
local government. The idea to explore legislative processes with  regard  to
establishing local youth units in the new municipalities was also mooted  by
this dynamic youth movement, the ANCYL.

We need to appreciate this demonstration of commitment on the  side  of  the
youth. It is our duty  as  Government  to  encourage  these  initiatives  by
facilitating a conducive environment for such  initiatives  to  develop  and
expand.

The  National  Youth  Service  Programme  will  be  one  of  the   important
mechanisms with which the initiatives of the youth to get involved in  local
socioeconomic development can be accommodated.
This 16 June we salute the memory of Comrade Steve Biko,  who  died  at  the
hands of the security  police.  We  also  salute  the  memories  of  Solomon
Mahlangu, who was executed at a  tender  age,  Ahmed  Timol,  Lenny  Naidoo,
Richard Turner, Braam Fischer  and  others,  all  of  whom  are  a  constant
reminder that the price of freedom and justice is life itself.

Today we mourn the death of Comrades Peter Mokaba  and  Zibusiso  Zuma,  the
young lions of our revolution. The injunction of  their  lives  is  that  we
should never betray the revolution that,  once  attained,  should  never  be
taken for granted. The only way in which we can celebrate  their  lives,  to
my mind, is to take forward the struggle  to  fight  poverty,  homelessness,
disease and illiteracy. This will make them proud,  and  there  will  be  no
need for us to ever bid them farewell.

of Sesotho paragraphs follows.)

[Yesterday I called the hon Borman to order for speaking on  behalf  of  the
poor, because he does not understand the pain of going to bed  without  food
or walking barefoot in winter. Today I realise that it is a matter of  pride
to be young. That is why the hon Da Camara, (whatever),  can  still  bravely
stand up and talk about problems facing youth. I want to say  that  where  I
come from, in the Free State  province,  the  Umsobomvu  Trust  has  already
started helping the youth with the training that will give them  skills  and
experience, which is what will prevent them from being  beggars,  but  cause
them to be job creators in this country.

This programme will help to eradicate crime and it will remove young  people
from the streets. I really do not know why I bother  myself  with  this  hon
member. In Sesotho we believe that ``a guilty conscience has  no  accuser''.
He has shown that he  is  responsible  for  the  problems  of  unemployment.
Moreover, one who knows the road has  once  travelled  on  it.   With  these
words I would like to end my speech, as we  cannot  say  everything  in  one
sitting.]
Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 13:37.

         Preamble
         We, the members of the Parliamentary Task Group on Sexual Abuse  of
         Children,
         Taking note with the greatest concern of the repeated instances  of
         sexual abuse of ever-younger children in our country,
         Considering that to protect our  children  from  all  instances  of
         such heinous crimes is not only a moral obligation of  the  highest
         priority but a legal obligation as well,


         Taking into account the rights of the child  and  values  contained
         in international instruments such as the  African  Charter  on  the
         Rights and Welfare of the  Child  and  the  UN  Convention  on  the
         Rights of the Child, which are legally binding  upon  the  Republic
         of South Africa,
         Recalling section 28 of  the  Constitution  of  South  Africa  that
         enshrines the rights of the child and  must  underpin  and  inspire
         all legislation of the Republic,
         Having been convened by a decision of the Speaker of  the  National
         Assembly of 11 February 2002, and in order  to  give  effect  to  a
         motion of the National Assembly of 14 November 2001
         Having held public hearings on the issue,
         Condemn once again strongly all forms of sexual abuse and  violence
         against children  of  all  ages,  irrespective  of  motivation  and
         person of the perpetrator,  and  issue  the  following  report  for
         consideration by the National Assembly.

         1. Introduction


         1.1     Composition of the Task Group on Sexual Abuse of Children


         The Task Group includes representatives  from  different  political
         parties present in Parliament and comprises the following members:


         Mr S Dithebe (ANC), Mr C Morkel (NNP) - Joint Monitoring  Committee
         on Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status  of  Children,  Youth
         and Disabled Persons;
         Ms P Cupido (DP), Prof S Mayatula (ANC) -  Portfolio  Committee  on
         Education;

         Social Development;
         Ms P Govender (ANC), Ms  R  Southgate  (ACDP)  -  Joint  Monitoring
         Committee on the Improvement of  Quality  of  Life  and  Status  of
         Women.
         The hearings were also attended by a number  of  other  Members  of
         Parliament who were not officially members of the Task  Group,  but
         whose  contributions  over  the  four  days  enriched  the  process
         significantly.


         1.2     Public Hearings
         1.2.1   Aims
         The aims of the hearings  as  defined  by  the  resolution  of  the
         National Assembly of 14 November 2001 were to  analyse  the  causes
         of child rape and abuse,  and  inform  the  parliamentary  counter-
         strategies appropriately. The  Task  Group  saw  the  aims  of  the
         hearings more specifically as
         *  Understanding the nature of sexual violence;
         *  Developing a comprehensive picture of the causes of  this  crime
           and the conditions that exacerbate it; the political, social and
           economic values that underpin this violence;
         *  Highlighting shortcomings in existing  legislation  that  should
           protect children,  such  as  the  Child  Care  Act,  the  Sexual
           Offences Act, the Criminal Procedure Act;
         *  Understanding  the  shortcomings  in  Government's  response  to
           violence  against  children,  such  as  services  to   families,
           especially  rape  survivors;  effective  police  casework;   the
           criminal justice system, the rehabilitation of offenders;
         *  Identifying short, medium as well as long  term  solutions,  and
           what action is needed from Parliament and Government;
         Establishing what is needed to change behaviour in respect  of  the
         sexual abuse of children.
         1.2.2   Process
         At the first meeting of the Task Group on 6  February  2002,  Mr  E
         Saloojee was unanimously elected as chairperson and it  was  agreed
         that he would take the responsibility of setting up  the  hearings.
         It was  decided  at  this  meeting  that  the  hearings  should  be
         publicised as widely as possible and that the  relevant  government
         departments should be invited to brief  the  Task  Group  on  their
         programmes aimed at combating the sexual abuse of children as  well
         as  the  legislative  framework  within  which   these   programmes
         operate.
         Advertisements were placed in the Sunday Times and  City  Press  on
         10 and 17 February 2002 indicating a cut-off date  for  submissions
         of 3 March 2002. In addition, in the week of  11-15  February  2002
         approximately 150 letters were faxed and  emailed  to  a  range  of
         organisations and individuals throughout the country who  would  be
         interested in the issue of rape and abuse  of  children.  The  five
         relevant Ministers and Departments were invited to make very  brief
         submissions on the first day of  the  hearings.  In  addition,  the
         South African Law Commission was invited to talk about  their  work
         on the Review of the Child Care Act and the Sexual Offences Act.
         Each Member of Parliament was given a batch of ten  copies  of  the
         print advert with a covering letter asking them  to  publicise  the
         hearings in their constituencies. The Task Group made every  effort
         to ensure that it would benefit form as wide a range of  inputs  as
         possible. The  Chairperson  engaged  the  services  of  the  Public
         Education  Department  at  Parliament,   which   organised   public
         information radio spots about the issue on  14  radio  stations  in
         all the official languages during the week of 23 February  2002  to
         3 March 2002. The Public Education Department also facilitated  the
         placement of extensive coverage of the hearings in the  Independent
         Newspaper Group, which includes the Star and the Cape  Argus.  This
         was done using the resources of the Public Education Department.
         Notwithstanding the time constraints within which the  process  had
         to be completed in order for  the  Task  Group  to  report  to  the
         National Assembly by 15  March  2002,  51  responses  in  terms  of
         applications to make oral  submissions  were  received.  Through  a
         process of careful selection,  the  Chairperson's  office  and  the
         Committee section decided on which  organisations  and  individuals
         would be accorded a time slot. This decision was taken with a  view
         to ensure the participation of the  broadest  spectrum  of  society
         possible,  and  included  members  of  the  academic  sphere,  non-
         governmental organisations, representatives of the  Executive,  and
         concerned  or  directly  affected  people  from  rural  and   urban
         environments. Those persons and  organisations  who  could  not  be
         accommodated in  the  programme  were  invited  to  submit  written
         submissions.
         The Task Group agreed to fund eight individuals who were  not  able
         to afford to travel to Cape Town so that people  are  not  excluded
         due to economic reasons. In  all  about  76  submissions  had  been
         received. The Task Group agreed to accept  written  submissions  in
         any of the official  languages,  and  in  cases  where  people  are
         unable to write, to accept recorded submissions  so  that  as  many
         voices were heard as possible.
         The Task Group was supported in the extensive preparations  of  the
         hearings by the Parliamentary Research Unit.
         The hearings were held from Monday, 11 March 2002 until  Wednesday,
         13 March 2002 from 09:00 to 17:00 each day, and  from  14:00  until
         18:00 on Thursday, 14 March 2002. Although there were serious  time
         constraints, the Task Group  is  satisfied  that  it  was  able  to
         extract from the hearings the relevant information to  achieve  the
         aims of the hearings. The meeting on 14 March 2002,  at  which  the
         Task Group heard submissions from a  group  of  children,  was  not
         open to  the  public.  This  was  done  in  order  to  protect  the
         identities of the children, some of who  were  survivors  of  abuse
         including sexual abuse. The Afrika Cultural Trust  facilitated  the
         children's participation.

         A summary of all submissions received by the Task Group  listed  in
         alphabetical order follows in section 2 of this Report.


         2. Summary of submissions
         2.1     ACCESS
         2.1.1   Problems
         *  The nature of data collection regarding women  and  children  is
           problematic.   For   example   the   SAPS   will   not   provide
           disaggregated data for age on the various crimes.  Children  are
           defined as under the age of 15 years and women as 16  years  and
           over. This underestimated the number  of  children  affected  by
           crimes.
         *  There is an assumption in the ABC  strategy  that  young  people
           consent to sex. Children often lack the power to abstain  or  to
           use condoms.
         *  Fear of HIV/Aids is driving some men  to  have  sex  with  young
           children.
         *  Poverty is a  key  structural  factor  that  results  in  abuse.
           Children are affected the most by poverty.
         *  Environmental poverty such as leaving children in  the  care  of
           unsuitable care-givers, overcrowded conditions  exacerbated  the
           vulnerability of children.
         *  The lack of comprehensive social security means that  a  limited
           number of children receive  grants.  The  allocated  grants  are
           limited and have not increased  significantly  over  the  years.
           This means that in fact there  is  an  actual  decrease  in  the
           number of children reached by these grants.
         2.1.2   Recommendations
         *  Introduce a comprehensive social security system for  all  South
           Africans. A basic income grant is supported.
         *  Improve access to the Child Support Grant.
         *  Revisit the care dependency  grant  criteria  to  include  those
           that are HIV positive.
         *  Improve healthcare delivery for sexual abuse survivors.
         *  Increase  and  improve  the  quality  of  care  and  support  to
           survivors of violence.
         *  Restructure the budgetary allocation and commitments  to  social
           service spending to address child poverty.
         *  Adopt the United Nations 20/20 initiative,  which  is  aimed  at
           encouraging donor government and  institutions  to  direct  more
           than  20%  of  their  resources  to  social  spending.  It  also
           encourages governments of developing countries to  do  the  same
           with their domestic expenditure.
         2.2     Aids Orphans Community Programme
                 This submission pointed out that there has been  a  notable
                 increase in the incidence of child rape, with girls younger
                 than eight years increasingly being  targets.   It  further
                 maintains that in many cases, the rights and protection  of
                 children  are  ignored  by  government  officials,  police,
                 teachers, nurses,  justice  officials  and  University  Law
                 Clinics.
         The submission outlines the conditions that lead  to  the  increase
         in sexual abuse of children in South Africa as being:
         *  A culture of violence and victimisation;
         *  A breakdown of the family unit;
         *  Lack of respect for children's rights and priorities;
         *  Disrespect of girls and women by men;
         *  Myths about curing HIV;
         *  Shocking neglect of cases by police and the justice system;
         *  A culture of impunity towards the law.
         2.2.1   Recommendations
         *  Police and protection services,  and  the  justice  system,  are
           held accountable for  cases  that  they  are  investigating  and
           prosecuting. They must ensure that their work is done thoroughly
           and timeously;
         *  Children are provided with support, protection  and  counselling
           services;
         *  Child protection units should be  strengthened  and  capacitated
           with experienced and dedicated professionals;
         *  Special  courts  should  be  provided  for  efficient  and  fast
           prosecutions and added protection  for  children  through  child
           friendly services in court;
         *  The government to act immediately  against  police  and  justice
           officials who aid  and  abet  the  work  of  child  rapists  and
           abusers, by allowing cases to be  badly  investigated,  delayed,
           ignored and even mislaid.
         *  The establishment of an Ombudsman  to  deal  with  follow-up  on
           cases which are reported, but continually delayed or reneged  on
           by the police and justice system;
         *  Immediate testing for HIV of all sexual offenders;
         *  Justice officials to oppose bail  and  heed  minimum  sentencing
           criteria for crimes against children.
         2.3     Anonymous
         The anonymous writer of a letter to the Task  Group  mentions  that
         his or her grandchild was raped, allegedly by a preacher, but  that
         despite numerous attempts to bring the matter to the  attention  of
         the Police, there has been no movement  on  the  case.  The  writer
         suggests that there may have been  collusion  between  the  accused
         and the corrupt police officials.
         The submission does not make any recommendations.
         2.4     Baby Rape and Child Abuse Investigation Task Team
         The submission focused on the role that society plays  in  creating
         the environment for  such  abuse.  It  argued  that  South  African
         society is "sick" since it views children as disposable, views  sex
         as casual, tolerates degrading depiction of women and  to  a  large
         extent tolerates rape. The submission calls  for  the  introduction
         of stricter sentences but acknowledges that it will not  solve  the
         problem. The problem lies in the religious  faith  of  our  society
         that has weakened, thereby negatively affecting the moral fibre.
         2.4.1   Proposals
         *  The  1997  Choice  on  Termination  of  Pregnancy  Act  must  be
           abolished;
         *  The Government must not fund LoveLife and other programmes  that
           promote immoral behaviour.
         *  Government must support abstinence until marriage;
         *  The SABC must not be allowed to promote immoral values;
         *  The sale and possession of pornography must be made illegal;
         *  The  death  penalty  for  rapists  and  child  abusers  must  be
           introduced.
           The  presentation  concludes  by  showing  the   links   between
           pornography and the abuse of children. A  number  of  local  and
           international case studies are used.
         2.5     Cape Town Child Welfare Society
         The submission was based  on  the  need  for  developing  effective
         capacity building programmes at community level.  These  programmes
         have to be cost effective and integrated within the  broader  legal
         and justice areas in terms of the protection  agencies  and  courts
         of law. The Society manages a number of programmes, the  latest  of
         which is the Isolobantwana (The Eye  on  the  Children)  Programme.
         This is an innovative, cost effective community  capacity  building
         programme aimed at preventing and eradicating child  abuse  in  the
         communities that the Society serves.  The  Society  impressed  upon
         members of  the  Task  Group  the  critical  importance  of  social
         workers and volunteers to ensure successful outreach and  programme
         operations.
         2.5.1   The Isolobantwana approach
         The  programme  is  structured  in  such  a  way  that  communities
         identify selected volunteers. These volunteers are trained  by  the
         social workers to enable them to deal with cases  of  child  abuse,
         neglect and family care. The training focuses  on  topics  such  as
         the  signs  and  symptoms  of  child   abuse,   parenting   skills,
         legislation  and   conflict   management.   After   training,   the
         volunteers' knowledge is tested before they are authorised  by  the
         Commissioner of Child Welfare to legally remove a  child  from  the
         primary caregiver in the case of a threat to  the  child's  safety.
         This is a major breakthrough  for  the  programme,  as  previously,
         legislation allowed only police  officers  and  social  workers  to
         perform this function. Trained  volunteers  fulfil  specific  roles
         among which would be to:
         *  Serve on the Management Committee, which manages  the  programme
           and assumes responsibility for sustaining it.
         *  Assist to investigate cases that are referred to  them,  counsel
           vulnerable families or  monitor  problematic  cases  for  social
           workers.
         *  Provide  places  of  safety.  Volunteers  open  their  homes  to
           provide care to abused, neglected and abandoned children for  up
           to a maximum of 48 hours, until the matter can be followed up by
           social workers.
         *  Fulfil  a  preventative  role  by  facilitating  regular  public
           awareness meetings about pertinent issues in their communities.
         2.5.2   Problems previously experienced
         *   Many  abused  and  neglected  children  did  not  receive   the
           necessary assistance, as cases were not reported to the  welfare
           society.
         *   Most  of  the  communities  face  similar  problems   such   as
           unemployment, illiteracy, broken families, substance abuse etc.
         *  Social  workers  often  felt  overloaded  with  high  caseloads,
           limited human and  other  resources  to  deal  effectively  with
           cases.
         2.5.3   Attempts to address the concerns
         *  Empowering the community by training selected community  members
           to be available to children at risk.
         *   Building  capacity  within  communities  by  increasing   their
           knowledge about resources and responsibility.
         *  Enhancing networking  among  communities  and  harnessing  their
           resources  in  order  to  render  an  effective  24-hour   child
           protection service.
         2.5.4   Benefits of the Programme
         *  It is very cost-effective and  services  are  localised  at  the
           community level.
         *  It has increased the productivity of social workers.
         *  It has provided a  24-hour  child  protection  service  for  the
           target communities.
         *  It has effectively empowered communities to take  responsibility
           for their lives and the safety of their children.
         2.6     Child Abuse Action Group
         The  submission  provides  a  perspective  of  gaps   in   existing
         legislation/service  providers  in  protecting  children  in  South
         Africa.
         2.6.1   Problems -Social Services
         *  Too understaffed to deliver necessary assistance to  the  abused
           child and their family;
         *  The  Department  of  Social  Development  "appears  to  only  do
           traffic control" - child and or family are just routed from  one
           home to other;
         *  No trauma therapy or very little ongoing therapy  takes  places,
           especially  where  the  family  is  unable  to  afford   private
           therapists;
         *  False hope about a positive outcome is  created  in  the  abused
           and traumatised child that if he/she reports the abuse;
         *  Sniggered by the  police,  peace  officers  when  they  try  and
           report their ordeal;
         *  Victims have to travel far and  wait  for  hours  amongst  other
           patients to have a medical attendant examine them;
         *  Medical attendants are often untrained and  insensitive  to  the
           emotional state of the child;
         *  Inadequate training of medical personnel to recognise abuse  and
           insufficient information is recorded and this often  impacts  on
           the evidence in court proceedings;
         *  Some medical practitioners are foreigners and  when  they  leave
           the country, there is a reluctance or  unwillingness  to  return
           for the trial or the state cannot afford to  pay  the  bill  for
           their return to the trial.
         2.6.2   Problems - Education
         Although the Department of  Education  has  embarked  on  the  Life
         Skills Programme to highlight the aspects of  child  abuse,  it  is
         also important that communities understand that it  is  also  their
         duty to protect the children. However, many communities are  unable
         to recognise abuse, as it is a way of life.
         2.6.3   Problems - Judicial System
         *  The time it takes to obtain and to see any form  of  justice  is
           traumatic;
        *  The impact of this slow process has had negative effects on  the
           child in terms of emotional, educational and social outcomes;
         *  While there are options for  communities  to  provide  input  at
           parole hearings, most often family members are not notified when
           these hearings take place to lodge their input.
         *  Conviction rates are low.
         2.6.4   Recommendations
         *  The tendency is to place the child back with the  abuser  -  why
           not remove the perpetrator.
         *  The judicial system has to be speeded up;
         *  As there  are  perpetrators  at  all  the  different  levels  of
           society,  it  is  imperative  to  have  private  and   impartial
           evaluators of a child who reports abuse;
         *  The child must receive appropriate  therapy  to  deal  with  the
           abuse and society's ability inability to prosecute;
         *   The  child  should  not  be  sent  to  industrial  schools   or
           institutions as it appears that their  disclosure  has  punished
           them while to them it appears  that  the  perpetrators  are  the
           heroes;
         *   It  is  crucial  that  communities  be  encouraged  to   attend
           workshops where communities are conscientised around the issue;
         *  The  infrastructure  of  the  various  departments  need  to  be
           established to provide ongoing workshops for communities;
         *  Officials need to be sensitised  to  the  emotional  and  mental
           make-up of the abused child so that the process of interrogation
           and investigation is conducted in  a  sensitive  manner  without
           inflicting more damage;
         *  Correctional services officials need to compile  and  understand
           the profiles of child abusers and their impact on society.
         2.7     Child and Family Welfare Society of Pietermaritzburg
         This submission makes recommendations  and  suggestions  about  the
         adoption of a model of better management of child abuse cases.  The
         paper outlines  the  problems  encountered  in  South  Africa  when
         dealing with the issue of sexual abuse of children  and  thereafter
         provides a model  of  managing  child  abuse  based  on  the  Child
         Advocacy Centre (CAC) Concept. Research has been conducted  on  the
         way in which the system currently operates in the United States  of
         America. The Child and Family Welfare Society  of  Pietermaritzburg
         is currently engaged in a  national  project  co-ordinated  by  the
         South African  Society  for  the  Prevention  of  Child  Abuse  and
         Neglect  (SASPCAN),  which  is  looking  at   the   viability   and
         establishment of such centres. The paper  argues  that  because  of
         the problems encountered with the present  system,  the  Children's
         Advocacy Centres (CACs) model provides a useful tool  to  replicate
         in the South African context.
         The model argues for a comprehensive,  multi-disciplinary  response
         to child abuse, ranging from  interviews,  case  tracking,  medical
         services etc. The envisaged model is based on the  concept  of  the
         one-stop centres but  this  model's  primarily  focus  will  be  on
         strengthening children who are sexually abused.


         2.8     Child Protection Programme, University of the Western Cape


         2.8.1   Problems


         *  Child abuse is not confined to a social class.
         *  Poverty places children at risk.
         *  Child protection  workers  are  struggling  to  find  a  balance
           between protection and poverty eradication.


         2.8.2   Recommendations


         *   The  Department  of  Social  Development  should  complete  the
           National Strategy on Child Abuse, Neglect and  Exploitation  and
           provide a completed draft to Cabinet.
         *  An inter-ministerial committee should be established to  oversee
           the  implementation  of  the  strategy.  The  main  aim  of  the
           committee should be to establish inter-sectoral co-operation  at
           national and provincial level.
         *  Cabinet should allocate grants to fast-track the  implementation
           of the strategy and should mandate all national  departments  to
           prioritise implementation of the strategy.
         *  Provision should be made for implementation in  the  medium-term
           expenditure framework.
         *  There is a focus on community based interventions and  therefore
           a consultative approach on policy is important as  is  the  need
           for all relevant departments to form  partnerships  with  NGO's,
           the business sector,  research  and  training  institutions  and
           community based organisations to impact both on the  development
           and implementation of a strategy.
         *   Social  services  should  be  a  desk   in   local   government
           structures.
         *  Neighbourhood childhood intervention is important but links  are
           needed to support these services.


         2.9     Childline-South Africa


         2.9.1   Childline's services
         The Organisation represents six regional Childline structures  that
         provide 24-hour toll-free crisis telephone counselling services  to
         children and their families or caretakers, throughout the  country.
         A total of 50 000 calls are received each month.
         Other services offered include:
         *  Treatment of abused children and their families.
         *  Court preparation for the child survivor.
         *  Abuse education and prevention programmes.
         *  Training of lay counsellors, both  for  the  crisis  counselling
           lines as well as for remote rural  and  semi-rural  areas  where
           there are no formal resources providing services in the field of
           management and prevention of child abuse.
         *  Training of professionals who work with abused children.
         *  Some Childline centres  provide  for  the  treatment  of  child,
           adolescent and adult sexual offenders.
           Sexual abuse is the single largest category  of  child  problems
           that Childline deals with. Their services tend to be used by the
           poorer sections of our communities as  services  are  free.  Any
           child or caregiver, who has access to a telephone, has access to
           Childline.


         2.9.2   Childline's experiences
         After conducting an overview of statistics of reported child  abuse
         over the last 10 years Childline has noted:
         *  A massive increase in the number  of  reported  cases  of  child
           sexual abuse of up to 400%.
         *  A decrease in the average age of the sexual assault  victim.  In
           1991 the average age of the sexually assaulted child was between
           10 and 12 years. Presently, 50% of all children attending  KZN'S
           therapy services after sexual abuse are under the age  of  seven
           years.
        *  A decrease in the average age of the sexual offender.
         *  An escalation in the use of brute force.


           2.9.3 Causal factors


        *  The socio-political history of the country has eroded family and
           community life.
         *  Broken family lives.  Particularly  the  family  life  (or  lack
           thereof)  of  child  offenders  is   characterised   by   severe
           emotional, relationship and/or physical deprivation.
         *  The traditional methods of  teaching  young  people  responsible
           sexual behaviour have been lost and acceptable alternatives have
           not yet been integrated into family life.
         *  The HIV/Aids pandemic and the myths that accompany it have  also
           contributed to the vulnerability of children.
         *  The pandemic of domestic violence.
         *  Poverty.
         *  There is lack of financial  support  for  the  NGO  Sector  that
           works in the field of child sexual assault.
         *  The lack of service  delivery,  free  schooling  and  employment
           opportunities for youth, especially those living in poverty.
         *  The Government has failed to accept, develop and  implement  the
           National Child Protection Strategy.


         2.9.4   Solutions to the problems


         *  Law Reform. The presenter supported the  review  of  the  Sexual
           Offences Act &  Child  Care  Act  that  is  currently  underway.
           However, she argues unless  resources  and  political  will  are
           committed to the implementation of law, these acts  will  remain
           "paper tigers". Although some progressive legislation is already
           in place, it is simply not implemented.
         *   The  development  and  implementation  of  a   National   Child
           Protection Strategy.
         *  Role-players in the criminal justice system who  fail  in  their
           responsibility   to   protect   children   through   corruption,
           disinterest and carelessness must be held accountable for  their
           failure and disciplined appropriately.
         *   Resources  must  be  committed  to  projects  that  effectively
           protect children from abuse and manage children after they  have
           been abused.
         *  Role-players who work within the child  protection  system  must
           be  appropriately  selected  for  their   roles,   appropriately
           trained, and appropriately debriefed on a regular basis.
         *  The Department of Education should be encouraged to  include  in
           its life skills education the teaching of human rights,  impulse
           management and responsible sexual behaviour. These skills should
           be taught to all learners, both male and female at  every  level
           of the education process.
         *  The introduction of social security for  all  children  who  are
           destitute and easier access for those who are deserving of  this
           assistance.
         *  Attention must be paid to  the  child  sexual  offender.  It  is
           essential to develop programmes and  services  for  these  young
           people who are usually the victims  of  abuse  themselves.  They
           should  whenever  appropriate  be  diverted  from  the  criminal
           justice system.
         *   Punishment  of  the  child  sex  offender  has   to   be   more
           appropriate.
         *  Attention must  be  given  to  child  victims  of  child  sexual
           assault especially male victims. Research at Childline indicates
           that the male victim of childhood  abuse  and  neglect  is  more
           likely to  develop  abusive  behaviour  during  both  child  and
           adulthood.


         2.10    Children's Institute, University of Cape Town


         Professor Andy  Dawes  represented  the  University  of  Cape  Town
         Children's  Institute.  The  Institute  is   a   multi-disciplinary
         research institute established within the Health  Sciences  Faculty
         of UCT. Its primary  mission  is  to  conduct  research  to  inform
         policies  and  programmatic   interventions   that   will   enhance
         children's  well-being  and  rights.  The  Institute  focuses,   in
         particular,  on  children  rendered  vulnerable  by   poverty   and
         difficult circumstances.


         2.10.1  Underlying causes of sexual abuse of children


         *  Poverty. The presenter argued that  while  poverty  is  not  the
           sole cause of sexual abuse, it does  amplify  the  factors  that
           place children at risk. In other words, people  with  low  self-
           esteem, a low sense of personal control over their lives, and  a
           tendency to depressed moods, struggle  more  to  cope  with  the
           strain of poverty. Fundamentally, people who are  struggling  to
           cope with the strains of poverty may feel over burdened  to  the
           point  at  which  childcare  becomes  yet  another  strain.  The
           presenter also distinguished  between  structural  and  personal
           features that raise  the  risk  of  abuse.  Structural  features
           include overcrowded housing in which there is little possibility
           of  separation  between  sexualised  adults  or  teenagers   and
           children and poor recreational and related resources for  youth.
           Personal features include high levels of  alcohol  abuse,  large
           numbers  of  unemployed  men  and  youth  and  the  struggle  of
           individual parents to cope with the strains of poverty.
         *  The attitudes and behaviour of men towards women  and  children.
           According to the presenter the common denominator in  all  cases
           of sexual abuse is that the abusers are men  or  boys  and  nine
           times out of ten  the  victims  are  girls.  He  identified  the
           following cultural and attitudinal factors that  are  associated
           with the risk of  sexual  abuse,  regardless  of  socio-economic
           status or ethnicity:
         *  Male presumptions regarding their rights and powers in  relation
           to women and children.
         *   A  cultural  background  that  promotes  male   dominance   and
           aggression towards women and children.
         *  An ideology that sexualises  young  girls  through  a  range  of
           practices. These include media  and  local  community  practices
           such as talent contest in  which  young  girls  are  lauded  for
           imitating the sexualised performances of pop stars.


         2.10.2  Recommendations


        *   Ensuring  that  children's   immediate   human   and   physical
           environments do  not  pose  a  risk  for  abuse.  This  involves
           community level development and support strategies that  can  be
           implemented in the short to medium term.
         *   Attempting  to  address  some  of  the  underlying  attitudinal
           factors that lay the ground  for  child  abuse  in  its  various
           manifestations. This involves the much more difficult and  long-
           term process of changing attitude and behaviour. This is  likely
           to occur over several generations rather than in the short term.


         *  Strengthening social cohesion and making neighbourhoods safe.
         *  Supporting vulnerable families at risk of abuse.
         *   Developing  programmes  aimed  at  re-orienting  attitudes  and
           practices.
         *  Funding research into the problem and into solutions.


         2.11    Children's Rights Centre


         The Children's Rights Centre presented a submission supporting  the
         reform proposals made by the  South  African  Law  Commission.  The
         Centre  mentioned  the  various  agencies  or   service   providers
         responsible for dealing with the victims and  offenders  of  sexual
         offences   and   the   procedure   for    disclosure,    reporting,
         investigating  and  the  court  hearings,  rules  of  evidence  and
         sentencing of the sexual offender. They particularly supported  the
         call for a multi disciplinary approach and for child sensitive one-
         stop centres. The Centre supported the broader definition of  rape,
         handing of victims, treatment against HIV infection and  long  term
         monitoring of sex offenders.


         2.12    CIET Africa


         Dr. Neil Anderson made presentations on behalf of CIET Africa.   He
         provided a summary of a national pilot  study  on  sexual  violence
         and HIV risk in school going youth aged 12-21 years.
         The study dealt with various themes including:
         *  The frequency of sexual violence.
         *  Social implications of sexual violence.
         *  The effect of HIV/Aids on children.


         2.12.1  Findings


         *  6% of both sexes endured from forced sex.
         *  Rural areas were considerably more affected than urban areas.
         *  The age at which sex was forced upon children  was  increasingly
           young.
         *  With a strong bias to the rural areas.
         *  Rape cases are not evenly spread over the country.
         *  Greater significance of simply any abuse.
         *  One third of the sample group were sexually active.
         *  90% of the older youth were sexually active.
         *  Touching and beating was more common than forced sex.
         *  20% of that males were forced to have sex.
         *  19% of the girls were forced to have sex.
         *  17% of the boys said that had raped before.
         *  9% of the girls agreed to raping before.
           He looked at the question whether victims would become villains,
           and stated that on average victims were three times more  likely
           to commit the crime. He noted that all the findings  were  based
           on self-reports  and  admissions,  thereby  making  the  results
           fairly reliable.


         2.12.2  Social implications


         *  Culture of sexual violence important because 40% to 50%  of  the
           children thought that rape did not happen if it was someone that
           they knew.
         *  Boys said that girls meant yes when they said no. A ratio of  1:
           5 girls agreed.
         *  Boys said  that  girls  preferred  violent  guys.  1:  20  girls
           agreed.
         *  Boys said that girls asked for rape
         *  In general, boys said that girls had no right  to  say  'no'  to
           sex with their boyfriends. Some females agreed.
         *  Over half of the youth said that sexual violence was  caused  by
           girls, or by both sexes.


         2.12.3  Responses


         *  The teams were welcomed by all but one teacher.
         *  There was a low non-response rate by the youth.
         *  There was a high level of participation.
         *  All schools requested that they return in the future.
         He stated that the results pointed to the fact  that  children  did
         not have anyone to talk to about  the  problems.  This  called  for
         guidance counsellors.


         2.12.4  Additional findings


         *  Many youth said that they would/do not use condoms
         *  20 -30% of them stated that the use of condoms would not  reduce
           the chance of become HIV infected.
         *  Many believed that sex with a virgin does cure HIV.
         *  Many children stated that they believed that they  were  already
           infected with HIV.
         *  Many of the children said that they would have sex, even  if  in
           the knowledge that they were HIV positive.
         *  Between 10% and 15% of the youth were willing to spread HIV.


         2.13    Clemenshaw, Dot


         The submission highlights the following causes  for  the  abuse  of
         children:
         *  The gender and resultant power imbalances in our society;
         *  Uncontrolled sexual urges of men;
         *  Effects of migrant labour system on tribal and family life.
         *  Poverty and overcrowding;
         *  Inadequate childcare facilities for poor families;
         *  Judgmental sexual  education  for  the  youth  and  health  care
           professionals.
         *  Biased reporting by the media.

         This submission details a proposal made to the  Gauteng  Provincial
         Government  for  a  multi-disciplinary  approach  to   caring   for
         survivors of child abuse. The  programme  aims  to  provide  abused
         children   and   rape   victims   a   complete,   specialised   and
         compassionate service under one roof.
         The problems related to child abuse and rape victims identified  in
         the submission include:
         *   Rape  victims  from  poor  communities  are  often  not   taken
           seriously, with the result that  they  feel  threatened  by  the
           system and find it difficult to benefit  from  formal  treatment
           and care structures
         *   When  a  victim  is  very  poor,  having  to  travel  from  one
           department to another is costly and places an  extra  burden  on
           the already traumatised victim. The length of time it  takes  to
           finalise cases adds to this difficulty.
         *   The  protective  system  and  services  are  often  not  child-
           friendly, with the result that the  child  sees  social  service
           officials, police and the court as threatening and intimidating.
         *  The system of gathering  evidence  does  not  always  take  into
           account the needs of very young victims,  and  the  evidence  is
           then insufficient to ensure  a  conviction  -  this  causes  the
           victim's family and friends to distrust the system.
         *   The  disappearance  of  case  dockets  and  other   delays   in
           completing cases represents  secondary  abuse.  It  also  causes
           communities to distrust the abilities of the police.
         *  There is no effective combined investigation and  rehabilitation
           programme offering  victims  of  abuse  a  caring  and  complete
           service.
         *  Communities are not informed and educated about the impact  that
           child abuse  has  on  the  child;  there  is  also  insufficient
           information about how to identify early stages of child abuse.
         *   The  media  attention   given   to   perpetrators   fuels   the
           perpetrator's  sense  of  power  over  the  victim.  This  makes
           rehabilitation of such a perpetrator much more difficult.
           It is therefore recommended that
         *  Government must  accept  that  it  cannot  address  the  problem
           alone, and that it has to make use of the full cooperation  from
           communities, the private sector, churches etc.
         *  Society as a whole must accept  co-responsibility  for  fighting
           child abuse and rape.


         2.15    Community Law Centre, University of the Western Cape
         Ms.  Jackie  Gallinetti,  co-ordinator  of  the  Children's  Rights
         Project at the University of the Western Cape, concentrated on  the
         judicial aspects to combat sexual abuse of children.


         2.15.1  Problems


         *  Lack of co-ordination and co-operation in  dealing  with  sexual
           abuse cases.
         *  Problems regarding child testimony include:
         *  Competency of the child to  give  evidence.  Presiding  officers
           often do not have the expertise to decide  whether  a  child  is
           competent.
         *  Cautionary rules. General practice is to  treat  child  evidence
           with caution especially in the case of a single witness.
         *  Cross-examination of child witnesses. These guidelines  are  too
           loose and encourage aggressive practices. .
         *  Evaluation of child evidence. Too many people  are  involved  in
           the interviewing of child victims, which lead to problems around
           credibility of evidence.
         *  Corporal punishment.  Chastisement  is  used  as  a  defence  by
           parents in abuse cases.
         *  Media. The media has been identifying child victims contrary  to
           provisions in the law.




         2.15.2  Recommendations


         *  A  multi-disciplinary  approach  should  be  adopted  to  ensure
           better co-ordination and co-operation between role players.
         *  Inter-sectoral agreements and protocols should  be  incorporated
           in legislation to increase accountability of departments.
         *  Presiding officers should be trained  in  child  development  in
           order to assist them to  make  decisions  regarding  competency.
           When in doubt, experts should be called in to make decisions.
         *  The presenter supports the SALC recommendation  to  abolish  the
           cautionary  rules  but  because  of  time  calls  for  immediate
           amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act.
         *  The SALC recommendation  to  control  the  cross-examination  of
           witnesses in sexual cases should be  broadened  to  include  all
           cases involving children, not only those of sexual abuse.
         *  It is important to ensure proper training of interviewers and  a
           consistent approach in  interviewing  children.  Pilot  projects
           should be rolled out throughout the country. Pilot projects  use
           a single interviewer and videotapes for evidence.
         *  Support is given to  the  SALC  recommendation  that  reasonable
           chastisement is removed as  a  defence,  but  states  that  they
           should remove the right to corporal punishment even at home.  An
           awareness campaign should be initiated on alternative  means  of
           disciplining children.
         *  The National Director of Public Prosecutions must  instruct  its
           regional offices to enforce sections of the law  protecting  the
           identity of children.
         *  A code of conduct in the media should be established which  will
           protect children from identification.


         2.16    Concerned Citizens Against Pornography (CCAP)


         The submission raises the following concerns:
         *  Non-Governmental Organisations and the  Government  co-ordinated
           and facilitated a number of events which are aimed at addressing
           the  problem  of  child  and   sexual   abuse.   To   date   the
           recommendations of those stakeholders  have  not  been  factored
           into policy and the practices of the justice system;
         *  The justice system is not sensitive  and  equipped  be  able  to
           deal effectively with child sexual abuse issues;
         *  The rate of abuse of children's  rights  is  high.  Child  abuse
           occurs in many instances where people make profit from it;
         *  The operation of "adult  shops'  in  residential  and  community
           shopping areas creates a problem that  needs  to  be  addressed.
           Where communities oppose such shops in their vicinity,  this  is
           often ignored. The rights of individuals seem to be  allowed  to
           prevail at the expense of community. As a  result  the  rate  of
           prostitution in those vicinities increases;
         *  There are a number of child and sexual abuse events  that  occur
           in the name of "tradition" while it violates law. There needs to
           be clarity about these because children are often  abused  as  a
           result.


         2.17    Department of Education


         2.17.1  Policies
         A range of strategies and polices have been put into place  by  the
         Department, shortly after receipt of the Gender  Equity  Task  team
         Report in 1997. In 2000, a module  on  Managing  Sexual  Harassment
         and Gender-based Violence was developed  for  schools.  The  module
         has been piloted in Gauteng, the  Free  State  and  Mpumalanga  and
         will be taken to the rest of the provinces  in  2002.  It  provides
         schools with the knowledge and  skills  needed  to  deal  with  the
         different facets of sexual harassment and violence.
         The Department, together with the  South  African  Police  Service,
         completed a workbook on Signposts to Safe  Schools  in  2001.   The
         workbook serves as a reference for action to be  taken  by  schools
         on a range of school safety matters, including  sexual  abuse.  All
         schools should receive a copy by the end of May 2002.  A  teacher's
         manual on gender equity in education has been developed  to  ensure
         that schools become friendly to girl learners.
         The Department will work to ensure a common understanding  of  what
         constitutes  sexual  harassment  through  the  development   of   a
         national sexual harassment policy.


         2.17.2  Programmes


         *  The Safe Schools project  was  launched  in  1999  in  order  to
           create safe and disciplined learning environments that celebrate
           innocence and  value  human  dignity.  The  Project,  which  was
           launched as  part  of  the  Tirisano  Implementation  Plan,  has
           focused on, amongst others:
         *  Improving physical safety at schools
         *  Mobilising communities to take ownership of schools
         *  Developing policies on school safety
         *  The focus of the  Life  Orientation/Life  Skills  learning  Area
           within Curriculum  2005  is  intended  to  develop  the  skills,
           knowledge,  values  and  attitudes  that   are   essential   for
           participating in a democratic society.
         *  Due to the image of the teaching  profession  being  damaged  by
           the recent Medical Research Council report on the Rape of  Girls
           in South Africa, the Department has to embark on a  campaign  to
           restore confidence in the profession.
         *  In the next  few  weeks  the  Minster  will  be  announcing  the
           establishment of a special task team. This task team  will  work
           closely with various stakeholders to  continuously  monitor  the
           implementation of  the  legal  and  policy  instruments  in  the
           education system.
         *  The Department launched a programme in 2002 to empower girls  to
           extricate themselves from difficult  situations.  The  programme
           aims to create awareness in  girl-children  that  they  are  not
           defenceless and therefore do not have to be victims.


         2.17.3  Legislation


         An amendment to  the  Employment  of  Educators  Act  of  1998  was
         introduced  in  November  2000.  The  amendment  provides  for  the
         dismissal of a teacher who has been found guilty of engaging  in  a
         sexual relationship with a learner, with or without the consent  of
         such learner. The South African Council for Educators Act  of  2000
         ensures that when a teacher is found guilty of the sexual abuse  of
         a learner, s/he is deregistered as  a  teacher  and  may  never  be
         appointed as a teacher.


         2.17.4  Inter-Departmental Initiatives


         The Safe  Schools  Project  focuses  on  establishing  partnerships
         between  the  Department  of   Education   and   other   government
         departments as well as civil society organisations.
         The Department proposes collaborating  with  other  Departments  in
         order to monitor how survivors  experience  processes  relating  to
         the report of sexual abuse outside schools.
         2.18    Department of Health


         2.18.1  Problems


         *  Sexual abuse  and  rape  cases  often  result  in  psychological
           trauma to health workers.
         *  Sexual abuse of children can result in:
         *  Physical trauma to children.
         *  Emotional trauma.
         *  Physiological trauma.
         *  Infections.
         *  Risk of exposure to HIV and Aids.
         *   The  Department  of  Health  faces  a  number   of   challenges
           including:
         *  Increased number of cases.
         *  Increased complexity of injuries requiring  specialized  medical
           skills.
         *  The need for prolonged and sustained  psychological  support  to
           the child and the family.
         *  Lack of human resources and capacity in certain areas.
         2.18.2  Programmes
         In  addressing  the  above,  the  Department  has  implemented  the
         following:
         *  Gender Focal Points assist in sensitising health workers to  the
           issues. This will lead to increased investigation of  suspicious
           cases.
         *  Training of  health  workers  in  skills  to  deal  with  abused
           children.
         *  Forensic nurse training to increase  the  pool  of  health  care
           workers in dealing with abuse cases.
         *  Gender Focal Points together with the Medical  Research  Council
           is assessing medico-legal services.
        *  The department participates in inter-departmental initiatives on
           violence.
         *  Family intervention and the promotion of  the  role  of  men  in
           child care.
           Attention will be given to the reduction of abuse of alcohol and
           other substances which impact on the sexual abuse of children.


         2.19    Department of Home Affairs
         2.19.1  Defining Child Pornography


         Child pornography is defined  as  any  image,  real  or  simulated,
         however created, depicting a person who  is  or  who  is  shown  as
         being under the age of 18 years engaged  in  sexual  conduct  or  a
         display of genitals which amounts to sexual conduct.


         2.19.2  Effects of Child Pornography
         Once a pornographic image is in the public domain, it is likely  to
         be distributed and reproduced, regardless  of  the  fact  that  the
         perpetrator has already been caught. These  images  will  therefore
         inevitably follow the child up to  and  through  adulthood  causing
         immense humiliation  and  pain.  Most  children  who  are  sexually
         abused suffer physical harm including various  infections,  genital
         sensitivity and soreness, as well as  anal  irritation.  The  child
         may also be infected  with  HIV/Aids.  The  abuse  has  a  negative
         effect on a child's intellectual and emotional well-being.
         2.19.3  Legislation and Conventions Dealing with Child Pornography


         *  Articles 19 and 34 of the UN Convention on  the  Rights  of  the
           Child (CRC)
         *  The Agenda for  Action  adopted  at  the  First  World  Congress
           Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in 1996.
         *  Convention 182 adopted by the International Labour  Organisation
           in June 1999.
         *  Article 9 of the Convention  on  Cyber-Crime  published  by  the
           Council of Europe in June 2001.


         2.19.4  Findings


         *   There  is  a  strong  link  between  the  possession  of  child
           pornography and sexual abuse.
         *  The incidence of child pornography is increasing.
         *   There  is  a  need  for  an  effective,  unified  international
           response to child pornography.
         *  Specialist police units dealing with child pornography  need  to
           be established.
         *  Hotlines or triplines should be set up to allow individuals  who
           have found what they think are illegal material on the  Internet
           to report it.


         2.19.5  Recommendations
         *  There is a need for proper and effective co-ordination  at  both
           government and civil society levels.
         *  The expertise and  resources  of  the  entire  criminal  justice
           system, including the Child Protection Unit, must be developed.
         *  It is  vital  that  members  of  the  judiciary  gain  a  proper
           understanding of the new developments  in  the  distribution  of
           child pornography. Their sentencing policy should  also  reflect
           society's abhorrence of the sexual abuse of children.
         *  Internet service  providers  must  be  brought  into  the  fight
           against the use of the Internet for the sexual  exploitation  of
           children and child pornography.
         *  Public education on the dangers of unsupervised  access  to  the
           Internet must be prioritised.
         *  Government must give effect to the plan of action of  the  World
           Congress Against the Sexual Exploitation of Children.
         *  The Office of the President must be provided with the  necessary
           resources to become more involved in  protecting  children  from
           child pornography.
         *  The setting up of the "24/7" network, which is required  of  all
           countries that have signed the Budapest  Cybercrime  Convention,
           must be given some priority.


         2.20    Department of Justice and Constitutional Development


         2.20.1  Policies and Legislation
         The Department views  the  protection  of  the  victims  of  sexual
         offences as a matter of the great importance. It  has  thus  tasked
         the South African Law Commission to conduct  urgent  investigations
         with the view to improve the legal framework  relevant  to  dealing
         with sexual  offences.  The  Commission  subsequently  published  a
         discussion Paper on Sexual Offences. The Discussion paper  contains
         a  draft  Sexual  Offences  Bill  that  embodies  some  progressive
         recommendations on  the  reform  of  the  law  relating  to  sexual
         offences.
         The Bill includes revised substantive law provisions such as:
         *  A revised definition  of  the  offence  of  rape.  The  proposed
           definition extends the definition  of  'sexual  penetration'  to
           include any act which causes penetration by the  genital  organs
           of one person into the anus, mouth or genital organs of  another
           person. It will also include penetration by means of any object,
           including any part of the body of an animal, or part of the body
           of one person into the anus or genital organs of another person,
           in a manner, which simulates sexual intercourse.
         *  A view that non-disclosure by a person infected with a  sexually
           transmissible disease prior to  sexual  relations  with  another
           person constitutes rape.
         *  Affording vulnerable witnesses,  such  as  children,  additional
           protection measures during a sexual offence trial.
         *  Provision for the prohibition of the organisation  or  promotion
           of child 'sex tours'.
           *     Child prostitution now  constitutes  what  was  previously
           referred to as Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children due to
           the fact that the divergent role players, for example pimps  and
           clients, targeted in the original provisions, are  all  in  some
           way involved in child prostitution.
           In addition, the Department has tasked  the  South  African  Law
           Commission (SALC) to develop a comprehensive new law relating to
           children accused of crimes (Child Justice Bill). The new  system
           emphasises individual assessment of each child and tries to find
           alternative ways to deal with children. The idea is to keep them
           within their families and communities and to protect  them  from
           the damaging effects of courts and prison as  far  as  possible.
           Diversion options  and  programmes  embody  restorative  justice
           principles, which focus on reconciliation and restitution rather
           than on retribution and punishment.


         2.20.2  Minimum sentences
         The Criminal Law Amendment  Act  provides  for  the  imposition  of
         minimum sentences in respect of certain serious  offences.  Section
         51 of the Act states that  persons  convicted  of  certain  serious
         offences listed in Schedule 2 of the Act must be given a  mandatory
         minimum  sentence,  unless  the  judicial  officer   imposing   the
         sentence   is   'satisfied   that   substantial   and    compelling
         circumstances exist  which  justify  the  imposition  of  a  lesser
         sentence'. Rape is one of the offences  listed  in  this  Schedule.
         However, an empirical study by the  South  African  Law  Commission
         (SALC) has shown that  the  severity  of  incidents  of  rape  with
         aggravating circumstances committed  after  implementation  of  the
         Act has increased when compared  to  pre-implementation  sentences.
         The study thus questions the effectiveness of the minimum  sentence
         approach prescribed by the Act as a crime reduction mechanism.
         The SALC has proposed a  draft  Sentencing  Framework  Bill,  which
         seeks to address sentencing disparities in a  number  of  ways.  It
         lays down explicitly as  a  prime  sentencing  principle  that  all
         sentences must be proportionate to the seriousness of the  offence.
         Seriousness, in terms of the draft Bill, is  to  be  determined  by
         the degree  of  harmfulness  of  the  offence  and  the  degree  of
         culpability of the offender. According to the extended  legislative
         programme of the Department,  the  Bill  will  be  introduced  into
         Parliament as soon as circumstances permit, either during  2002  or
         later.


         2.20.3  Repeat offenders.


         The Criminal Law  Amendment  Act  provides  for  a  mandatory  life
         sentence of persons convicted of two or more offences of rape,  but
         who have not yet been sentenced in  respect  of  such  convictions.
         Repeat sex offenders for rape are therefore  liable  to  a  minimum
         sentence of life imprisonment. In  1997  the  Department  tightened
         bail provisions. Section 60  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  was
         amended to provide that where an accused person is charged with  an
         offence listed in Schedule 6 of the Act, such a person must  remain
         in custody. The onus is on the accused to prove to the  court  that
         exceptional circumstances exist that permit  his  or  her  release.
         Schedule 6 offences include rape where the victim  was  raped  more
         than once or by more than one person; where the  victim  was  raped
         by a person charged with having committed two or more  offences  of
         rape or by a person knowing he has Aids or HIV.


         2.20.4  Provisions for rape victims to testify.


         The focus areas of the SALC's discussion paper on  Sexual  Offences
         are on process and procedure. Specific recommendations are made  in
         this discussion paper and the draft Sexual Offences  Bill  to  make
         it easier for victims of sexual offences to testify in court.  This
         includes, amongst others, the creation of a category of  vulnerable
         witnesses,  removal  of  cautionary  rules  and  one-way   mirrors.
         Section 170A of the Criminal Procedure Act makes provision for  the
         appointment of  competent  persons  as  intermediaries.  Where  the
         court is of the opinion that a witness under the age  of  18  years
         may suffer undue  mental  stress  if  he  or  she  testifies,  such
         intermediaries may be appointed to testify on behalf of the  child.
         The insertion of this section  ensures  that  survivors  of  sexual
         offences  testify  in   victim-friendly   environments   and   that
         secondary  victimisation  through  participation  in  the  criminal
         justice process is eliminated.


         2.20.5  Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Unit (SOCA)


         This Unit is one of  the  Operational  Units  within  the  National
         Directorate for Public Prosecutions. It was established in 1999  to
         focus on violent and indecent offences against women and  children,
         as well as family violence in general. It ensures that victims  and
         witnesses are treated fairly in court. The main priorities of  SOCA
         are  to  reduce  sexual  offences,  increase  the  reporting  rate,
         improve the conviction rate,  reduce  secondary  victimisation  and
         reduce the time taken to finalise cases.
         The Unit has established three Multi-Disciplinary Care Centres  for
         the victims of sexual offences and domestic violence  at  hospitals
         in the Eastern and Western Cape. These  Centres  constitute  a  co-
         ordinated  approach  that   brings   together   different   service
         providers in a 'one-stop' model.


         2.20.6  Inter-Departmental initiatives


         The Department believes that  curbing  the  escalation  of  violent
         crimes and rape  against  women  and  children  requires  a  common
         approach by the relevant stakeholders. These are the Department  of
         Justice and Constitutional Development, the  South  African  Police
         Services (SAPS), Correctional Services,  Social  Development,  Home
         Affairs, the Office on the Status of Women and the  Office  on  the
         Rights of the Child in the Presidency.


         The National  Crime  Prevention  Strategy  (NCPS)  has  prioritised
         crimes against women and children. This priority area  consists  of
         a   number   of   interdepartmental   programmes,   supported    by
         departmental  action.  These  programmes  are  interdependent   and
         complement each other. However,  each  has  a  distinct  focus  and
         cannot be collapsed into one  programme  with  one  approach.  They
         include:


         *  Interdepartmental Management Team. This Team was established  in
           2000, and is led by the Sexual Offences  and  Community  Affairs
           Unit (SOCA) of the National Directorate of Public  Prosecutions.
           It also includes the SAPS, the Department of Social  Development
           and the Department of Health. The Team was scheduled to  make  a
           submission to Cabinet on a draft action plan for  the  reduction
           of rape and the improvement of criminal justice  processes  with
           regard to rape and sexual offences during January 2002.
         *  Domestic Violence  Programme.  The  Inter-departmental  domestic
           violence programme addresses aspects like the implementation  of
           the Domestic Violence Act of 1998, dealing with perpetrators and
           victims of domestic violence and intersectoral co-operation. The
           Department  of  Justice  and   Constitutional   Development   is
           responsible for leading  the  implementation  of  the  Act.  The
           Department of Social  Development  is  responsible  for  leading
           programmes for victims and offenders.
         *  Victim Empowerment. This programme aims to improve  services  to
           all victims of  crime.  It  makes  provision  for  victims  with
           specific needs like women and children.
           A South African Victim Charter was finalised during 2001 and  an
           implementation plan  is  being  developed.  Agreement  has  been
           reached on a framework for the development of a set  of  minimum
           standards for victim empowerment.


         *   Child  Protection.  All  provinces  are  implementing  a  Child
           Protection register. Guidelines on the notification  of  alleged
           child abuse cases has been finalised.  Good  progress  has  been
           made to rationalise national and provincial structures for child
           protection. A Protocol on the  Management  of  Child  Abuse  and
           Neglect has also been completed.


         *  Dealing with offenders. A national Inter-Sectoral  Committee  on
           Child  Justice,  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Justice   and
           Constitutional Development was specifically  set  up  to  gather
           information and make recommendations for specific  interventions
           concerning  the  situation  of  children   awaiting   trial   in
           detention.  The  Committee  monitors  children  awaiting   trial
           through the collation of statistics provided by the  Departments
           of Correctional Services, Social Development and SAPS.


           Further steps to deal with children awaiting trial  include  the
           establishment of  additional  One-Stop  Child  Justice  Centres,
           improved legal representation for children  and  providing  more
           diversion programmes.


         2.21    Department of Safety and Security


         The National Commissioner of Police,  Mr.  J  Selebi,  assisted  by
         various  staff  members,  represented  the  South  African   Police
         Service (SAPS). The Department's presentation centred on the  three
         aspects of the  work  of  SAPS  in  relation  to  rape  and  sexual
         offences, namely:


         2.21.1  Policies and Legislation


         1.  Prevention.  SAPS'  activities  focus  on  the  prevention   or
               reduction of crimes through community and  sector  policing,
               situational crime prevention and policing the factors  (such
               as drugs and alcohol) that contribute to crime and violence.
               The policy documents underlying  the  preventative  work  of
               SAPS is the National Crime Prevention Strategy of  1996  and
               the White Paper on Safety and Security.


         2. Response and Investigation. The SAPS  reaction  to  crimes  like
               rape  and  sexual  offences   includes   investigation   and
               gathering  evidence  for  use  in  prosecution.  The  policy
               documents that relate  to  the  investigation  of  rape  and
               sexual offences cases are:


         *  National Instruction 22/1998:  Sexual  Offences.  This  document
           deals  with  support  to  victims  at  crucial  aspects  of  the
           investigation.
         *  Family Violence,  Child  Protection  and  Sexual  Offences  Unit
           (FCS) policy document.
           In addition, members of SAPS are providing  input  and  comments
           into the following legislative processes:
         *  The Sexual Offences Bill (SA Law Commission Project 107).
         *  The Child Care Act (SA Law Commission Project 110).
         *  The proposed amendment to the Films and Publications Act, 1996
         *  The Child Justice Bill, 2001


         3. Support to victims and witnesses. The SAPS  considers  the  need
                 to adopt a victim-centred approach in the criminal  justice
                 process as crucial. It thus provides programmes to  improve
                 services  to  victims  and  support  victims  through   the
                 criminal justice process. The  Department  of  Justice  and
                 Constitutional  Development  is  currently   finalising   a
                 Victims' Charter  for  South  Africa.  Following  from  the
                 Victims'  Charter,  the  SAPS  is   developing   a   Victim
                 Empowerment Policy and National Instruction.  This  process
                 is in its final consultative state and will be concluded in
                 2002.


         2.21.2  Programmes


         2.21.2.1      Internal Programmes


         The SAPS acknowledges the fact that sexism  and  gender  inequality
         impact negatively on human rights. It has thus committed itself  to
         vigorously fight to eliminate unfair discrimination and  to  uproot
         sexual  harassment.  To  this  end,  it   has   initiated   various
         programmes and measures. These include:
         *  Counselling services. This  programme  is  aimed  at  addressing
           substance abuse and domestic and marital  problems  for  members
           and their immediate family members.
         *  Presentation of pro-active programmes. These include  programmes
           on managing stress effectively, life skills and the facilitation
           of the development of ethical behaviour.
         *   Awareness  Programmes.  These  include  programmes  on  suicide
           prevention,  HIV/Aids  awareness  and  prevention   and   sexual
           harassment.
         *  Partnerships. The Department has entered into  partnership  with
           several initiatives and institutions. These include  the  Office
           on the Status of Women, the Commission on  Gender  Equality  and
           Non-Governmental Organisations  such  as  NICRO,  Women  Against
           Abuse (WAWA) and People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA).
           The Department listed various problems that hamper the effective
           handling of sexual offence cases. These include a guilt  feeling
           of the victim who thus does not go for support,  withholding  of
           progress reports from the victim, blackmailing  of  victims  and
           the attitude of management.


         2.21.2.2      External Programmes
         1. Prevention


         *  Crime trend analysis. Crime trends at local level  are  analysed
           to inform prevention and crime combating operations.
         *  Crime prevention projects with Community  Police  Forums,  other
           community  organizations,  NGOs  and  other  departments.  These
           programmes target crimes such as rape and sexual offences.  Many
           of them focus on public education and mobilizing communities  to
           report crimes and fulfil their responsibilities as witnesses  to
           crime.
         *  Crime prevention projects at police stations.  During  2001,  20
           police stations were prioritised for crime  prevention  projects
           to address crimes against  women  and  children.  These  include
           crimes such as rape, sexual offences, child abuse  and  domestic
           violence. For 2002, 128 where 50% of rape  cases  are  reported,
           have been prioritised for this purpose.
           The Department emphasised the need to  mobilize  other  partners
           from all government departments and civil society.


         2. Response and investigation


         *  Involvement in multi-disciplinary  programmes  aimed  at  crimes
           against children. These include the Department's involvement  in
           the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual  Offences  Unit
           (FCS). The Department also participate in various International,
           national, provincial and local committees and forums working  on
           crimes against children.
        *  Training courses. The Department offers various training courses
           for members with regard  to  offences  against  children.  These
           include  a   basic   detective   course,   a   sexual   offences
           investigations course, and a FCS  Investigators  course.  During
           2002, the Department will also introduce a new  course  on  sign
           language, which is specifically aimed at  assisting  people  who
           are unable to voice their concerns or complaints.
           Specialised Child Protection Units
           As a response to the letter of the Chairperson of the Task Group
           on Sexual Abuse of Children, the following table  gives  details
           on the units located in different provinces. These special units
           are well equipped with personnel.

         In the year  2000,  1  551  convictions  were  made  by  the  Child
         Protection Units. In the year 2001,  2112  convictions  were  made.
         However in 2001only 369 out of 1551 cases were finalized while  378
         out of  2112  cases  were  finalised.   The  sentences  imposed  on
         offenders include fines and imprisonment.


         3. Support to victims and witnesses


         *  SAPS Victim Empowerment Programme. This programme is  aimed  at,
           amongst others:
         *  Training SAPS members in victim empowerment.
         *  Improving facilities for victims at police stations.
         *   Involving   the   community   in   practical   victim   support
           initiatives.
         *  Improving feedback to victims.
         *  Implementation of the Domestic Violence Act of  1998.  The  SAPS
           is one of the departments responsible for the implementation  of
           the Domestic Violence  Act.  The  Act  provides  the  SAPS  with
           various ways to intervene in domestic  violence  incidents  that
           are reported. These include:
         *  Arrest and protection during the incident.
         *   Victim  support  and   referral   for   further   support   and
           counselling.
         *  Discretion to arrest where there is imminent harm.
           The Act also requires  the  SAPS  to  record  all  incidents  of
           domestic violence in a register, and report to Parliament  every
           six months  on  complaints  against  police  officers  for  non-
           compliance with the National Instruction on Domestic Violence.
         *  Training. Starting in 2002, the basic training for  all  members
           include victim empowerment training. During 2001 6  139  members
           were trained. 30 849 members were trained since the start of the
           Victim Empowerment Programme.


         2.21.3  Inter-Departmental initiatives


         The Department stressed  the  crucial  importance  of  adopting  an
         integrated and multi-sectoral approach to fighting the  scourge  of
         rape and sexual violence. The main objectives of such  an  approach
         are prevention and co-operation. As such, it is  one  of  the  role
         players in various programmes with  other  government  departments,
         non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations.
         Inter-departmental   initiatives   in    which    the    Department
         participates include:


         *  The Anti-rape strategy.
         *  The Domestic Violence Programme.
         *  The Victim Empowerment Programme.
         *  The Child Abuse and Neglect Programme.
         *  The Child Justice Programme.
         *  The Women Empowerment Programme.
           The Department is also  represented  on  the  Inter-Departmental
           Management Team (IDMT) for rape and sexual offences, lead by the
           Directorate for Sexual Offences and  Community  Affairs  in  the
           National  Prosecuting  Authority.  The  IDMT  has  developed  an
           information-based approach to develop a strategy to address rape
           and sexual offences.
         The  Department  has  management  processes  in  place   for   each
         programme to ensure that the work is  done  in  an  integrated  and
         inclusive manner.


         2.22    Department of Social Development


         2.22.1  Introduction


         The Department of Social Development stated that the  Parliamentary
         hearings were significant in that they provided an  opportunity  to
         find solutions to child abuse and reflected a  greater  willingness
         to have the issue of sexual abuse discussed more openly.


         2.22.2  Policies


         The Department has based its policies on the  Constitution  of  the
         Republic of South Africa, the United  Nations'  Convention  on  the
         Rights of the Child and the  African  Charter  on  the  Rights  and
         Welfare of the Child. The Department's policies on child abuse  are
         not  confined  to  sexual  abuse,  but  also  include  neglect  and
         exploitation. Protocols for the management  of  child  abuse  cases
         have been developed in all Provinces. The protocols make  provision
         for a multi-disciplinary and integrated service  to  child  victims
         and their families. A similar protocol has been developed  for  the
         national departments  and  is  awaiting  final  comments  from  the
         relevant Ministers. The  NCCAN  has  developed  a  draft  strategy.
         While the principles and intentions  of  the  strategy  are  agreed
         upon, a Programme of Action with specific objectives,  targets  and
         time frames must support it.


         2.22.3  Programmes


         There  are  a  range  of  services  provided  by  the   Department,
         including  trauma   counselling,   clinical   assessment,   interim
         placement of children if  required  and  support  in  dealing  with
         investigative authorities.


         *  The Department has initiated a 24-hour service  pilot  programme
           providing for social workers to be  on  call  to  assist  police
           officers with cases of abuse. The service is  fully  operational
           in the Western Cape and the Free State and in one area  each  in
           Gauteng and the Eastern Cape.
         *  A Victim Empowerment Programme, co-ordinated by the  Department,
           has established 100 projects, many of which are one-stop or  24-
           hour services for women.
         *  Training has been provided to a range of professionals who  work
           with abused children.
         *  Life skills programmes for children form part  of  the  workload
           of social workers in the Provincial Departments.
         *  Provincial Departments participate in  social  crime  prevention
           programmes such as the Neighbourhood Response Programme (NRP) in
           the Western Cape and  Safe  Houses  Programmes  (SHP).  The  NRP
           assists community members to identify  and  report  child  abuse
           cases.  The SHP involves the training of safe house parents.
         *   Community  awareness  campaigns  are  conducted  during   Child
           Protection Week in May and Social Development Month in October.
         *  A Directory of Children's Services has been  produced  with  the
           assistance of Save the Children Fund, together with a  Directory
           of Services to Victims.


         2.22.4  Legislation


         The  Child  Protection  Register  has  been  established   in   all
         provinces in terms of  section  42  of  the  Child  Care  Act.  The
         purpose of the register is to monitor each reported case on  sexual
         abuse. The register operates  on  a  manual  system.  However,  the
         system  will  be  computerised  by  November   2002.   The   Inter-
         Departmental Committee has identified the need  to  strengthen  the
         legislative framework and harmonise all laws. The  Child  Care  Act
         is widely regarded as being inadequate and therefore  needs  to  be
         replaced by new comprehensive childcare legislation. Section  4  of
         the Prevention of Family Violence Act of 1993 needs to be  repealed
         since it has created confusion with respect to reporting  cases  of
         sexual abuse.


         2.22.5  Inter-Departmental Initiatives


         *  Social workers from the Department work  closely  with  officers
           of the Child Protection Unit (CPU) in certain provinces.
         *  The NCCAN was established as a  sub-committee  of  the  National
           Plan of Action for Children in South  Africa  (NPA).  The  NCCAN
           comprises the main  government  departments  involved  in  child
           abuse, provincial representatives as well as representatives  of
           the non-governmental sector.
         *  Provincial Child Protection Committees exist in all Provinces.
         *   Each  Provincial  Department  of  Social  Development  has   an
           official  appointed  as  the  Provincial  Child  Protection  Co-
           ordinator.
         *  The Inter-Departmental Committee has  identified  the  following
           priorities for action:
         *  Strengthening the  legislative  framework  and  harmonising  all
           laws.
         *  Improving the investigation of cases of abuse.
         *  More attention to prevention.
         *  Improving co-ordination of  services  provided  by  the  various
           departments and the NGO sector.
         *  Responding to children with special needs.
         *  Mobilising partnerships with communities.
         *  Building institutional capacity at all levels.
         *  Strengthening governance within the child protection system.
         *  Enhancing information, research, monitoring and evaluation.


         2.23    Domestic Violence Helpline, Durban


         2.23.1  Problems
         *  Victims often suffer secondary abuse as a result of  police  and
           court officials being stressed.
         *  In the Durban area, the following is observed:
         *  An increase in the number of younger females  between  the  ages
           of two-five years who are the victims of sexual abuse.  In  more
           than 60% of the cases,  the  perpetrators  are  the  fathers  or
           stepfathers.
         *  The perpetrators are often unemployed and are the caregivers  to
           these children.
         *   The  number  of  male  adolescent  perpetrators  has  increased
           significantly and in approximately 70% of the  cases,  with  the
           sexual crimes being perpetrated against family members.
         *  Pornographic materials are being distributed in schools.
         *  Younger boys at school, who are curious  about  sex,  have  been
           engaging in sexual acts with boys their own age.
         *  It  is  estimated  that  half  a  million  female  children  are
           sexually victimized annually.
         *  one in eight girls are forced to leave school due to pregnancy.
         *  Many cases, including that of baby Tshepang and the case of  the
           five year old that was raped, should be dealt  with  effectively
           by the justice and police systems.


         2.23.2  Recommendations


         *  Greater awareness programmes in communities.
         *  DNA testing should be decentralized to ensure that  the  results
           are obtained speedily and a conviction can be made.
         *  Courts should provide qualified social workers or  psychologists
           that are trained to work with the abused children in a sensitive
           manner.
         *  In camera facilities should be provided  so  that  children  are
           not exposed to perpetrators.
         *  The Judiciary needs to address the problem of delays in courts.
         *  The Child Protection Unit (CPU) needs  to  employ  more  trained
           personnel in the area of child abuse.
         *  Educators who are perpetrators should not be  granted  bail  and
           not be allowed to teach again.
         *  There  should  be  a  code  of  conduct  that  prohibits  sexual
           harassment and sexual relations between educators and learners.
         *  Social workers should address learners during  guidance  periods
           as part of the school curriculum.
         *   Government  and  all  stakeholders  should  work  together   to
           eradicate child sexual abuse.


         2.24    Donald Fraser Hospital


         The Hospital receives an average of 25 cases a month. They  have  a
         paediatric nurse and a social work team to deal with them, but  are
         in need of assistance to  train  them  in  forensic  medicine.  The
         Hospital has listed 15 cases,  which  they  have  received.  14  of
         which deal with sexual  violence.  The  single  case  dealing  with
         neglect involves  the  only  boy  child.  All  14  showed  physical
         symptoms of sexual violence. The ages of the survivors  range  from
         two to 14. The alleged perpetrators include nine  relatives,  three
         persons known  to  the  survivors,  four  strangers  and  1  minor.
         Predisposing factors include mental disabilities  and  the  parents
         living in another town. All but 1 case was reported to the  police.
         All are pending, except the one where the accused was a minor,  who
         as a result was not charged. Ten  of  the  complainants  have  been
         threatened to varying degrees subsequent to laying charges.


         2.25    Dr Yusuf Dadoo Primary School


         The principal, Dr Yusuf Ismail, has  proposed  that  the  following
         topic be included in the  discussions:  "The  link  between  sexual
         molestation and poverty of children in informal settlements".


         2.26    Dyanti, Felicia


         The presenter from Langa, spoke about her own childhood  experience
         of being abused.
         She related the story of being given away by her mother at the  age
         of five years to live  with  her  great-aunt  and  uncle.  She  was
         promised an education but was made to  fend  for  herself  and  was
         used as a slave in the house. She was beaten by her  aunt  and  was
         not allowed to play with other children.
         She was raped four times by the aunt's son.  Circumstances  in  the
         home forced her to run away. She was taken back after  being  found
         by a herdsman in the forest. At the age  of  11,  the  great  uncle
         abused her. At the age of 19 years, she went back home.


         2.26.1  Problems


         *  There is a silence in communities to talk about  and  deal  with
           rape.
         *  The Presenter's mother  does  not  really  understand  what  has
           happened to her and has never asked her about it.


         2.27    Far North Regional Network on Violence Against Women


         2.27.1  Challenges Facing Rural Areas


         *  There were approximately nine  to  34  rapes  reported  at  five
           police stations per month.
         *  The trauma centre has attended to  20  cases  each  month  since
           December 2001.
         *  There are no shelters for children in these areas. Children  who
           are abused by their father are sent back home.
         *  Poverty and a lack of understanding of what  constitutes  sexual
           abuse are also problematic.
         *  In one situation, the family of a three year old child  who  was
           raped by her father and subsequently died had no money  to  bury
           the child.
         *  Some children are raped on their way to fetch water as  well  as
           on their way to school.
         *   The  Child  Protection  Unit  in  the  area  only   has   eight
           investigating officers with no support staff or  researchers  to
           assist. There is also no computer or  typewriter  and  no  four-
           wheel drive vehicle to get to remote areas. If a case of rape or
           abuse is therefore reported in a mountainous area,  nothing  can
           be done about the case.
         *  Children have no support when they get to court.
         *  Rural communities feel as if they have been forgotten.
         *  When young girls go  to  court,  they  testify  before  everyone
           instead of giving evidence in camera. There are  furthermore  no
           intermediaries which results in the child feeling uncomfortable.
         *  Teachers need training since they do not know what to do when  a
           child is abused.
         *  The myth that Aids can  be  cured  through  sex  with  a  virgin
           continues to spread through the rural areas.


         2.27.2  Recommendations


         *  The Government is unable to stop abuse  without  the  assistance
           from communities.  Community leaders can  intervene  before  the
           child is raped and must therefore be  empowered  and  given  the
           necessary resources to do so.
         *  The police have to ensure that when rapes occur,  cases  receive
           immediate attention.
         *  Community members should monitor each case.
         *  Rural organisations require financial assistance.
         *  Education campaigns are  necessary  to  create  awareness  about
           sexual abuse between the illiterate and poor.   These  campaigns
           should be carried out using radio instead of television.  It  is
           also important to take language into consideration.
         *  More money needs to be made  available  to  run  workshops  with
           traditional healers so that they in turn can inform  communities
           about the myths surrounding sexual abuse.
         *The sexual offences court needs to be monitored by Parliament.


         2.28    It's Your Move Youth Action Group


         The organization is the youth component of the Molo  Songololo  NGO
         and works against the commercial sexual exploitation  of  children.
         It consists of approximately 50 t0 60 young people.  The  programme
         has three funders, namely Molo Songololo,  Terres  des  Hommes  and
         Save the Children, Sweden.


         2.28.1 Target groups for CSEC


         According to the group, all children and young  people  (girls  and
         boys)  are  vulnerable,  especially   street   children.   However,
         children from  stable  homes  are  also  at  risk.  In  fact,  some
         children are even 'pimped' by their own  parents.  Often,  children
         are made false promises of  work.  They  end  up  being  trafficked
         inside South Africa and across its borders.


         2.28.2  Factors that impact on the CSEC


         The group listed a number of factors that, in the opinion of  young
         children,  impact  on  the  commercial   sexual   exploitation   of
         children. These include:


         *  An increase in unemployment.
         *  Low levels of education.
         *  Changes in the religious and cultural beliefs of society.
         *  A breakdown in family and community support systems.
         *  Lack of social welfare and protective services for children.
         *  An increased demand for black children for sexual purposes.
         *  The myth that sex with a virgin will cure  sexually  transmitted
           diseases such as HIV and Aids.


         2.28.3  Who are the offenders?


         The group believes that children could be  sexually  exploited  for
         commercial purposes by individuals at  all  levels.  These  include
         parents, teachers, taxi drivers and club  owners.  Organised  gangs
         or syndicates and criminal networks are also  responsible  for  the
         scourge.


         2.28.4  Challenges


         *  All practices of  commercial  sexual  exploitation  of  children
           should be stopped.
         *  Child trafficking networks and syndicates should be destroyed.
         *  Preventative measures must be put in place.
         *  Support structures must be established for survivors.
         *  Laws should be  implemented  effectively,  especially  by  child
           protection authorities.
         *   Adequate  and  effective  sentences  should   be   imposed   on
           offenders.


         2.28.5  Recommendations


         *  Young people should be involved in the fight against CSEC.
         *   An  international  children's  day  against  CSEC   should   be
           instituted.
         *  We should focus on the demands or needs of victims.
         *  Government must start playing an active role in curbing CSEC.
         *  Legislation and  other  programmes  aimed  at  eradicating  CSEC
           should be harmonised so that there is a co-ordinated  effort  to
           fight CSEC.
         *   Organisations  should  share  their  mechanisms  that   provide
           information on CSEC to ensure optimal  usage  of  resources  and
           avoid a fragmented approach to the problem.


         2.29    Johannesburg Child Welfare Society


         2.29.1  Problems


         Concern and awareness have escalated in the  area  of  child  abuse
         yet services have deteriorated. There was  a  lack  of  questioning
         around whether existing child protection services are  equipped  to
         deal  effectively  with  the  problem  and   there   seems   little
         commitment  in  allocating  resources  to  this  area.  The   child
         protection system is in neglect  and  there  is  no  inter-sectoral
         budgetary process for this. A large number of  State  child  social
         services are transferred by the State  to  the  NGO  sector.  These
         organisations  only  receive  discretionary  subsidies  that   have
         decreased over the years. There is a de-linking of state  subsidies
         from civil service salaries.  The  salaries  offered  to  staff  of
         these NGOs are extremely low.  This results  in  a  loss  of  staff
         often to the State, which offers more  competitive  salaries.  This
         creates a gap within the  organisation  and  results  in  secondary
         victimization for the children, as the children now have  to  build
         a relationship with new (often not fully trained) staff.
         Budget cuts affect the level of training that  can  be  offered  to
         staff. Training is an essential component of developing  skills  in
         order to deliver an effective service  and  minimize  the  risk  of
         secondary abuse. Child social service organisations are  no  longer
         able to  access  traditional  funding  sources  such  as  corporate
         donations, subsidies  and  per  capita  grants  and  proceeds  from
         scratch  cards.  The  Lotteries  Act  relegates  child   protection
         organisations to the status of charities,  which  means  that  they
         receive a limited contribution from the proceeds.


         The Department of Education has restricted  their  Early  Childhood
         development responsibility to the  reception  year.  The  remainder
         has to be provided by the Department  of  Social  Development.  The
         contribution for Early Childhood Development programmes is  at  the
         discretion of provinces.  Early  Childhood  Development  programmes
         therefore often fall between the Department of  Social  Development
         and the Department of Education. Numerous  services  by  NGO's  are
         closing around the country.
         2.29.2  Recommendations


         *  A need for proper resourcing of key departments at national  and
           provincial levels such as Social  Development,  Justice,  Safety
           and Security, Education, Health and Correctional Services.
         *  It is  important  for  Government  to  form  implementation  and
           financial partnerships with NGO's in the area  of  child  social
           services.
         *  It is important to expand existing Early  Childhood  Development
           programmes, which have shown to be effective in  the  prevention
           of child sexual abuse and assisting in  breaking  the  cycle  of
           poverty.
         *  Poverty does not cause abuse but plays a  role  in  facilitating
           abuse.  The presenter supports  the  call  for  a  Basic  Income
           Grant, which will help to address child sexual abuse.


         2.30    Kadalie, Rhoda


         2.30.1  Defining abuse


         Abuse occurs when adults, either physically, or in some other  way,
         hurt children or young people  under  the  age  of  18  years.  The
         presenter  distinguished  between  four  kinds  of  abuse,   namely
         physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect and  sexual  abuse.  These
         four types of abuse are  often  interrelated.  The  presenter  thus
         argued for a multi-pronged approach to address the problem.


         2.30.2  Causes of child abuse


         According to the presenter, there are  no  definitive  reasons  why
         people abuse children, since these reasons  may  be  different  for
         different abusers. However, she pointed  to  the  following  common
         factors that have  been  identified  as  causing  adults  to  abuse
         children:


         *  Myths that having sex with virgins will cure Aids.
         *  High unemployment rates of males  in  the  informal  settlements
           and townships.
         *  A society characterised by extreme forms of  violence.  Violence
           against women and children, in particular, has become endemic to
           South African Society.
         *    Stress,   financial   problems,   powerlessness    in    adult
           relationships or unhappy circumstances.
         *  Socio-economic problems such  as  joblessness,  poverty,  and  a
           lack of proper housing, etc.


         2.30.3  The institutions responsible for protecting children


         The presenter cited three main institutions that  should  bear  the
         responsibility to protect children from all forms of  abuse.  These
         are the family, schools and the State.
         2.30.4  Proposed measures to protect children


         *  The family should start teaching  children  at  home  about  the
           various aspects of sex.
         *  The State should:
         *  Put in place adequate policies and legislation.
         *  Conduct research on, amongst  others,  the  extent,  nature  and
           background of the problem, myths around child sexual abuse, etc.
         *  Implement compulsory sex education for teachers and learners  at
           all levels, including preschools.
         *  Provide care and assistance for victims after rape or abuse  has
           been reported.
         *  Police and judicial  authorities  should  commit  themselves  by
           ensuring convictions and imposing stiff sentences.


         2.30.5   Recommendations  for  the  prevention  of   child   sexual
                 violence


         *  Assertiveness training and self-defence classes for children  at
           schools.
         *   Encourage  municipalities  to  reduce  the  number  of   unsafe
           streets.
         *  Subsidise safer schools projects making the safety  of  children
           paramount.
         *  National departments should conduct  extensive  campaigns  aimed
           at men to assume their responsibility to  prevent  child  sexual
           abuse.
         *  Children should be  encouraged,  by  means  of  TV  commercials,
           advertisements, and billboards to  talk  about  their  "secrets"
           with an adult whom they know and trust.
         *  Conduct community education campaigns  on  child  sexual  abuse.
           These campaigns should also focus  on  educating  adults  to  be
           vigilant regarding child abuse and to offer a helping hand  when
           a child needs it.
         *  All relevant  agencies  responsible  for  the  human  rights  of
           children should conduct extensive research on the issue over  an
           extended period of time.


         2.31    Kandawn, Masego
         This submission deals with abandonment and neglect of  children  by
         an unemployed mother who has  left  these  vulnerable  children  to
         survive on their  own.  The  result  of  this  abuse  is  that  the
         children are unresponsive and withdrawn.


         2.32    hosa, L


         The presenter is a teacher from a township in Newcastle,  which  is
         characterized by unemployment and poverty. She listed  seven  cases
         of abuse which she has  confronted  in  her  work  and  raised  the
         following concerns:


         *  In most cases, the  perpetrators  were  the  breadwinners.  This
           meant that other family members hesitated to  report  the  cases
           for fear of loss of earnings.
         *  Drug abuse exacerbates incidence of child abuse.
         *  Children are often left in the care of other family  members  or
           other people whilst the mother  is  away  at  work.  Most  abuse
           happens after school whilst mothers are at work.
         *  Mothers are often too busy  to  listen  to  their  children  who
           report being raped or abused.
         *  Mothers often trust abusers.
         *  Some abusers are known criminals and children are too scared  to
           report them.


         2.33    Khuma Multi-Purpose Organisation


         2.33.1  Recommendations


         *  A full-time advisor should be appointed at  each  school  around
           the country especially in primary schools to provide  supportive
           services to abused children.
         *  A centre for abused children should be established in each  area
           and should be operational 24 hours a day.  Children  could  stay
           at these centres either on a temporary basis,  during  times  of
           need, or permanently until they reach the age of 18 years.
         *   The  centre  should  include  representatives  of   the   Child
           Protection Units, District Surgeons and  counsellors  to  ensure
           that holistic care is provided to children when they  arrive  at
           the Centre after being abused.
         *  Life sentences should be given to people who  are  found  guilty
           of raping a child.
         *  Abusive mothers should be  reported  to  the  police  and  legal
           action taken against them.
         *  It would be important to interrogate cultural  notions  such  as
           the notion that a father is head of a  household  and  therefore
           has the right to do whatever he sees fit.
         *  Perpetrators need to be dealt with strongly.
           *     It is important to look at providing alternative resources
           to families where the breadwinner is accused of sexual abuse  of
           a child.  Many families do not report abuse in  these  instances
           due to fear of loss of earnings.
         2.34    Lucas, Shabalala


         Mr Lucas raises  the  concern  about  parental  neglect  of  school
         children and notes that the  non-payment  of  maintenance  severely
         impedes physiological development of children. Reporting to  social
         workers in the  area  yield  no  results  and  the  probability  of
         turning to crime to survive is high.  This  submission  raises  the
         issue of the culture of non-payment and maintenance defaulters  who
         deprive their children of basic necessities of life.


         2.35    Maister, Dolly


         She believes that the high  levels  of  sexual  abuse  are  due  to
         overpopulation, breaking  down  of  norms,  unemployment,  lack  of
         formal housing, child prostitution, environmental  destruction  and
         poverty. She states that a "prestigious  world  population  survey"
         10 years ago, recommended that South Africa adopts a one child  per
         family policy, as China has, in order to deal with  some  of  these
         challenges.  The  submission  recommends  that  Government  provide
         incentives and disincentives to  support  a  two-child  per  family
         policy.  Government  should  also  promote  the  ABC  campaign  and
         testing with regard to HIV/Aids. The  use  of  abortion  should  be
         encouraged for accidental pregnancies.


         2.36    Maklina, P M


         The submission raises the concern about the failure of the  justice
         system to arrest suspects and the release of arrested suspects.  It
         also questions the myth that  "sleeping  with  virgins  would  cure
         Aids". It recommends that the minimum sentence  for  child  rapists
         should not be less than 20 years.


         2.37    Mayne, Anne


         This  submission  focuses   on   the   connection   between   child
         pornography,  prostitution  and  gangsterism   in   the   organized
         systematic abuse of children. Ms Mayne's  research  emphasises  the
         strong link between pornography  and  violent  sex  crimes  against
         females and children.  This  is  supported  by  police  statistics,
         which indicate that there has been  a  steady  rise  in  child  sex
         abuse crimes from 1992 to the present, in the region of 65%.


         Some of the issues that need to be  addressed  are  advertising  in
         mainstream newspapers of teenage girls for sex and  families  using
         children as cash commodities to earn an income.


         The practice of trafficking of children from the rural areas  under
         the guise of finding them employment as domestics is  rife  in  the
         Western Cape. These children are then sexually  abused  and  forced
         into prostitution
         2.37.1  Recommendation


         *  The topic of child prostitution as  a  form  of  abuse  requires
           more empirical research.


         2.38    Medical Research Council (MRC)


         Dr. Rachel Jewkes presented on behalf  of  the  Gender  and  Health
         Group at the MRC.  Her  presentation  was  based  on  the  numerous
         research projects undertaken on child rape.


         2.38.1 Problems


         *  The 1998 South African Demographic and Health survey found  that
           1.6% of women interviewed were raped before the age of 15 years.
         *  Approximately 20 000 cases of rape against  children  aged  0-17
           years are reported to police each year.
         *  The survey found that 33% of rapes of under 15  year  olds  were
           perpetrated by school teachers and that 21% were perpetrated  by
           relatives.
         *  One third of cases of rape were gang rapes.
         *   The  consequences   of   rape   include   health   and   social
           consequences.
         *  There is an immediate risk of HIV  during  rape  as  well  as  a
           later risk of high risk sexual practices,  which  increases  the
           possibility of  HIV  infection.  Teenage  pregnancy  is  also  a
           possible consequence.


         2.38.2  Causes of rape:


         *  Gender inequality in society.
         *  Childhood environmental factors.
         *  Poverty.
         *  Alcohol and drug abuse.


         2.38.3  Recommendations


         *  Address gender inequality.
         *  Prevent poverty and alcohol abuse.
         *  Increase resources to police and courts.
         *  Increase resources to victim support services.
         *  Provide anti-retrovirals to rape survivors.  The  use  of  anti-
           retrovirals after rape is as effective to  rape  victims  as  is
           providing it to needle-stick victims.
         *   Improve  health  services  and  ensure  that  health  officials
           receive training with regard to rape survivors.
         *  Supports the Sexual Offence Legislation  of  the  South  African
           Law Commission.
         *  The Department of Education must act  against  predatory  school
           teachers.


         2.39    Mkhabela, Pleasure


         This submission illustrates the effects that  child  abuse  has  on
         victims. It cites the example of a case in the North West  Province
         where the relatives knew about the abuse but did nothing, as  there
         was a financial benefit to the victim.  The  perpetrator  paid  his
         victim's  school  fees.  The  victim  often  regards  home  as   an
         unsuitable place to live and  sees  the  prison  environment  as  a
         safer. The perception is that it is useless to report the  case  to
         the police since nothing would get done  and  it  only  exacerbates
         the situation.


         2.40    Molo Songololo


         This presentation  focused  on  the  organisation's  report,  which
         emanated from their research into the "Trafficking of Children  for
         Sexual Exploitation".


         2.40.1  Definition of sexual exploitation


         The presenter defined sexual exploitation as the sexual,  emotional
         and physical abuse of children through forms  of  sexual  violence.
         This includes rape, sexual battery, inappropriate  sexual  contact,
         exposure   to   inappropriate   sexual   acts,   pornography    and
         prostitution.
         2.40.2  Actions that constitute trafficking of children


         All  acts  involving  the  recruitment,  transportation,  transfer,
         harbouring and receiving of  children  constitutes  trafficking  of
         children.  This  can  happen  through  any  means,  including   the
         abduction, sale, use of force, threats, deception and use or  abuse
         of power or authority.


         2.40.3  United Nations statistics on trafficking of children


         The United Nations estimates that  between  two  and  four  million
         people per year are traded against their will  into  some  form  of
         slavery,  be  it  domestic,  labour,   begging   or   prostitution.
         According to the United Nations, many of these are children.


         2.40.4  Factors that contribute to trafficking


         *  Social and economic factors  contributing  to  the  increase  in
           poverty and child neglect.
         *  The vulnerability of children living in poverty.
         *  Inadequate legislation and application of the law.
         *  The lack of appropriate services and policies.


         2.40.5  Who are the affected children?


         *  Mainly girl children from the ages four years to 17 years.
         *  Children from rural and  urban  areas  in  search  of  work  for
           survival.
         *  Children who have left home because of poverty.
         *  Children who have been sexually abused.
         *  Children who have run away from places of safety.
           These children are trafficked for their organs, as drug runners,
           prostitutes,  child  brides   and   to   work   in   sweatshops,
           agriculture, domestic service and in the informal economy.


         2.40.6  Legislation and Conventions


         South Africa does not have  legislation  that  expressly  prohibits
         the trafficking of people.  However,  South  African  children  are
         offered protection from sexual exploitation in  several  pieces  of
         legislation such as the  Constitution,  the  Child  Care  Act,  the
         Films and Publications Act and the Prevention  of  Organised  Crime
         Act. Protection is also extended through International  Instruments
         such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of  the  Child,
         the Organisation of African Unity  (OAU)  Convention  on  Refugees,
         the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare  of  the  Child,  the
         Hague Convention on  the  Civil  Aspects  of  Child  Abduction.  An
         Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of  the  Child
         deals with the sale of children, child prostitution &  pornography.
         The  Protocol  emphasises  that  State  parties   must   strengthen
         international   and   regional   co-operation   by   multi-lateral,
         regional, and bi-lateral agreements and arrangements to combat  the
         sale of children, child  prostitution  and  child  pornography.  It
         further emphasises the importance  of  protecting  the  rights  and
         interests of child victims.


         2.40.7  Perpetrators and methods used


         The perpetrators  are  usually  parents  (mainly  mothers),  family
         members, older sex workers, gangs, brothel owners,  syndicates  and
         agents, government  officials  and  local  and  foreign  nationals.
         Children are sold, abducted,  held  in  captivity  and  debt-bonded
         (Traffickers pays parents for prostituting the child. Children  are
         sold for up to R60 000 - when the debt is nearly paid, they get re-
         sold). Children are transported via surface, air  and  sea  routes.
         The report indicates that these girls are debt-bonded for R12  000.
         Job offers were made to the parents for their children to  work  in
         restaurants, domestic service and on farms. Instead they were  sold
         into the sex industry.


         2.40.8  Findings


         *  There is a lack of anti-trafficking legislation.
         *  A lack of policy and bilateral agreements.
         *  Poverty & unemployment.
         *  A lack of services for children.
         *  An increase in the demand for sex with children.
         *  An increase in the numbers of prostituted children.
         *  The impact of HIV & Aids.
         *  Alleged  corruption  of  officials  in  Government,  police  and
           immigration authorities.
         *  A lack of public awareness.


         2.40.9  Recommendations


         *  Development of anti-trafficking legislation.
         *  Extra-territorial legislation and policy to  prevent,  intervene
           and rescue victims.
         *   Prosecution  and  conviction  of  all  involved   or   directly
           benefiting from the trafficking industry.
         *   Training  and  awareness  programmes  for   organisations   and
           administrators  of  justice  working  with  children  and  their
           protection.
         *   Compliance  with  international  agreements  and  agendas   for
           action.


         2.41    Moseki, Joshua
         This submission illustrates neglect of children in  the  household.
         The deprivation of food results in children resorting to  desperate
         measures in order to have a meal. This  submission  highlights  how
         the economic plight of parents impact on  the  ability  to  provide
         adequate care for their children.
         2.42    Mrwebi, Ms.


         The submission details a number of cases where children  have  been
         abused, but makes no comments about the causes  or  recommendations
         regarding the prevention of sexual abuse of children.


         2.43    Msibi, Prudence


         This submission raises a concern  about  the  Justice  Department's
         sentencing procedure by arguing that the sentences  handed  out  to
         perpetrators are too lenient. It indicates that within the  context
         of a rights-based approach, it appears that the rights  of  rapists
         are given precedence over  the  victim.  She  recommends  that  the
         minimum sentence for victims aged one month to 10 years  should  be
         20 years and 15 - 20 years for victims aged 11 years upwards.


         2.44    Nadel


         The submission by Nadel was presented  by  Ms  Johanna  Kehler  who
         stated that there are gaps in the  existing  legislation  regarding
         child rape.  The urgency of this issue requires action to be  taken
         before the new Sexual Offences Bill is passed by Parliament.


         2.44.1  Problems


         *  Current legislation does not do enough to protect children.
         *  In the year 2000, there were 58  rapes  or  attempted  rapes  of
           children reported each day. In 2001, 21 000  rapes  of  children
           were reported for that year. Of these,  21%  were  committed  by
           male relatives, 41% of all raped people were under the age of 18
           years, and of these, 50% were under the age of 11 years.
         *  Only 9% of all child rape cases  taken  to  court  result  in  a
           conviction.


         2.44.2  Child Care Act
         *  The Child Care Act provides for the removal of a child  in  need
           of care who has been ill-treated.  However,  'ill-treatment'  is
           loosely defined and this hinders the prosecution of  individuals
           who are both directly and indirectly involved  in  child  sexual
           abuse.
         *  The Act excludes 'any other person'  (other  than  a  parent  or
           guardian) who has knowledge  of  a  rape  occurring  from  being
           guilty of an offence.
         *  The Act does  not  clearly  define  the  obligation  by  certain
           categories such as teachers,  social  workers  and  health  care
           professionals who have knowledge of abuse or reason  to  suspect
           abuse, to report this information to the relevant authorities.


         2.44.3  Sexual Offences Act


         *  The Sexual Offence Act does not clearly define what  constitutes
           rape or indecent assault. In fact it can be understood that  the
           only consensual sex, according to the  Sexual  Offences  Act  is
           consensual sex in marriage. Rape is defined  as  only  occurring
           when the vagina is penetrated by a penis.
         *  The Sexual Offences Act can also  be  seen  as  excluding  child
           rape as it refers only  to  'women'.  It  also  excludes  female
           perpetrators and same sex rapes.
         *  The definitions of  immoral  or  indecent  acts  are  loose  and
           therefore offer little protection to victims.
         *  The word 'immoral' is value laden  and  therefore  inappropriate
           to define a criminal act.
         *  The Sexual Offences Act refers to youth but not to the  rape  of
           children specifically. Nadel states that it is insufficient  for
           the offence of child rape and sexual abuse  of  children  to  be
           implied  as  this  does  not  provide  adequate  protection  for
           children. Nadel furthermore notes complicity in the use  of  the
           word 'with' as apposed to the word 'against' in section 14.
         *   The  different  ages  of  consent  for  boys  and   girls   are
           problematic.
         *  Section 14(2) outlines arguments, which can be used  in  defence
           of accusations of rape. These include the  rape  of  prostitute,
           the accused was under  21  years  and  that  this  was  a  first
           offence.
         *  Gender bias still exists  in  the  Sexual  Offences  Act,  which
           specifically does not provide for rape by a female.
         *  The cautionary  rules  treat  the  testimony  of  complaints  by
           children and women with caution in court as they are presumed to
           be unreliable witnesses.
         *  In the Criminal Procedure Act, the previous  sexual  history  of
           the complainant is admissible in court.


         2.44.4  Recommendations


         2.44.4.1      Child Care act


         *  There is a need for a better  definition  of  ill-treatment  and
           what forms of sexual abuse constitute ill-treatment.
         *  People who are aware  of  the  occurrence  of  a  rape  must  be
           convicted even if they did not directly participate in the rape.
           The law must allow for the prosecution of any person who  allows
           and facilitates either directly or indirectly a rape to occur.
         *  If any person has knowledge  of  sexual  abuse  they  should  be
           obliged to report this information. The law should also  provide
           for the mandatory reporting by certain groups such  as  teachers
           and social workers.


         2.44.4.2      Sexual Offences Act


         *  Nadel supports the draft Sexual Offences Bill of the  SALC.  The
           draft Bill defines sexual penetration in a more inclusive manner
           and covers the rape  of  children,  same  sex  rape  and  female
           perpetrators of rape. They recommend that the current definition
           of 'unlawful carnal  intercourse'  be  replaced  by  the  SALC's
           definition on 'sexual penetration'.
         *  Nadel  recommends  a  clear  definition  of  indecent  acts  and
           supports the SALC proposal in this regard. They  recommend  that
           this definition be included in the current legislation.
         *  Nadel recommends the removal  of  the  tem  'immoral'  from  the
           Sexual Offences Act.
         *  Nadel recommends that Section 14 be removed in its entirety  and
           be replaced with the SALC's proposed Section  6  of  the  Sexual
           Offences Bill entitled 'Acts of  penetration  or  indecent  acts
           with consenting minors'.
         *  Nadel recommends that the clause declaring it a defence  that  a
           child was a prostitute at the time of a rape be removed.
         *  Minor perpetrators should be  tried  in  appropriate  Children's
           Courts. Furthermore, the age of majority should be decreased  to
           18 years from 21 years.
         *  Provision must be made for the perpetration of rape by a  female
           and for the inclusion of same sex offences.
         *   Nadel  supports  the  SALC  recommendation   to   abolish   the
           cautionary rules. They also support the SALC establishment of  a
           category of 'vulnerable witnesses', which  seeks  to  facilitate
           the protection of certain categories of witnesses.
         *  Nadel believes that a child's  previous  sexual  history  should
           never be relevant in a sexual offences case.


         2.45    National House of Traditional Leaders (NHTL)


         2.45.1  Problems


         *  The myth that sex with a virgin cures Aids is a  myth  that  has
           been perpetuated by  traditional  healers  and  not  traditional
           leaders.
         *  There is a thin line between  poverty  and  unemployment,  which
           has a direct impact on child rape and abuse.
         *  Sex abuse of children in schools is  facilitated  by  the  girls
           wearing short dresses, which may attract weaker men.


         2.45.2  Recommendations


         *  The National House of Traditional  Leaders  notes  with  concern
          the myth and commits itself to work with leaders in the  community
          to dispel the myth that sex with a virgin cures Aids.
         *  The maintenance of traditional morals.
         *  A national imbizo is to be  convened  for  provinces  and  their
           regions to pledge commitment to the Ubuntu concept. The  medical
           fraternity will be requested to explain the effects of  rape  on
           victims. The national imbizo  will  be  followed  by  provincial
           imbizos. The purpose of the imbizos is to urge people to develop
           self-esteem, self-respect and self-trust.
         *  The Department of Home Affairs and Safety  and  Security  should
           clamp down on illegal immigrants. Traditional  authority  police
           could be involved in these initiatives.  Traditional  mechanisms
           of monitoring strangers such as 'Go Bega' would assist  in  this
           regard.


         2.46    Palliative Medical Institute


         Dr Selma  Browde  presented  the  submission  from  the  Palliative
         Medical Institute. This institute  offers  training  for  community
         workers and people involved  in  home-based  care.  The  submission
         dealt with two main issues:


         *  The rape of babies and young children.
         *  Abuse and poverty.


         2.46.1  Problems


         *  The Institute has come into contact  with  people,  specifically
           in Gauteng who believe that sex with a  virgin  cures  HIV/Aids.
           One of the ways to counteract  this  problem  would  be  to  use
           traditional healers. The presenter stated that  there  are  over
           300 000 of these traditional  healers  and  even  when  a  small
           minority pass this information on to the community, they are  an
           extremely powerful force.
         *  Reluctance of parents to talk to their children about sex.
         *  The link between abuse and poverty is clear  around  the  world.
           Research documents a symbiotic relationship  between  abuse  and
           poverty. Poverty leads  to  emotional  breakdown  and  tensions.
           Deprivation creates a  lack  of  concern  for  oneself  and  for
           others. Poverty and unemployment breaks down the sense of  self.
           This leads to violence inducing behaviour exacerbated by alcohol
           and drugs. This internal lawlessness puts children at  risk,  as
           children are seen as extensions of  the  self.  It  is  easy  to
           express hatred on ones own, which may take the form of  physical
           or sexual abuse.
         *  Structural  factors  are  also  important  including  inadequate
           housing and living conditions. In overcrowded conditions  sexual
           taboos are broken. Incest is commonly associated  with  poverty.
           Young children exposed to adult sexual activity become  sexually
           precocious and learn inappropriate sexual behaviour.
         *  The status of teachers in our schools is low.


         2.46.2  Recommendations


         *  Organise traditional healers who are prepared  to  cooperate  to
           tell the community that the idea that sex with  a  virgin  cures
           Aids is untrue. What these healers say and how  this  should  be
           done must be done in consultation with the healers.  A  campaign
           should be well orchestrated  and  thorough  and  adequate  funds
           should be made available for the message to be sent clearly  and
           unequivocally to the communities.
         *  In order to combat rape as well as the spread  of  HIV,  parents
           must be reached.  The reluctance of parents  to  talk  to  their
           children  about  sex  must  be  combated.   The  institute   has
           organised a grouping called 'Parents of  People  with  HIV/Aids'
           which comprise committees of parents.  Workshops are  held  with
           these committees about issues around HIV/Aids and sexual conduct
           and encourages these parents are encouraged to  speak  to  other
           parents about these issues.
         *  Priorities of  spending  by  Government  must  e  channelled  to
           ensure that poverty alleviation and unemployment are targeted.
         *  Need to increase the status  of  teachers  and  this  should  be
           reflected in their salaries.
         *  Government partnerships with NGO's are important.
         2.47    Pandor, Naledi


         Ms Naledi Pandor,  motivated  for  the  establishment  of  a  South
         African  Sex  Offenders  Act  and  a  national  register   of   sex
         offenders.


         The sexual abuse and rape of girl children is so widespread in  our
         society that out of 20,000  estimated  cases  reported  each  year,
         nearly half are rapes committed on children.


         In schools, sexual violence directed at girls  erodes  their  right
         to education. Although some of  the  teachers  are  to  blame,  the
         entire  teaching  profession  should  not  be  condemned.   Further
         research needs to be conducted in this area.


         Moreover, South Africa has laws against  rape,  incest  and  sexual
         assault. But there is more that can be done. More so,  in  view  of
         the  fact  that  paedophiles  and  rapists   are   not   cured   by
         imprisonment. They are released  to  commit  their  heinous  crimes
         once more. By  recommending  the  abrogation  of  the  similar-fact
         doctrine the Law Commission project team  on  sexual  offences  law
         throws its weight behind the belief that sex offenders  are  repeat
         offenders. And that is why we need a Sex Offenders Register Act.


         2.47.1  Recommendations


         *  South Africa should consider enacting an amended version of  the
           UK Sexual Offenders Act and that we follow our Law  Commission's
           recommendations on amending our law of evidence to make it  more
           difficult for sex offenders to escape conviction;
           Compile a national register of  sex  offenders  to  ensure  that
           everything was being done to protect children from sexual abuse.
           Such a register will complement the positive steps already being
           taken by the police and other government agencies.
         *  Such a  register  will  make  it  difficult  for  offenders  get
           parole.
         *  Some provisions which could be considered based on both  the  UK
           and US examples include:
         *  Sex offenders must register with the  police  within  a  certain
           time period after release from prison.
         *   Community  protection  orders  ban  sex  offenders  from  areas
           frequented by children.
         *  Banning offenders from contacting victims.
         *  Adding conditions to sentencing provisions.
         *  Posting details of child abusers on the internet.
         *  Leaflet drops and posters at Police Stations and at libraries.
         *  The advantages of having such legislation include:
         *   Parents  feel  more  secure  and   can   take   the   necessary
           precautionary measure, if they know that a paedophile resides in
           their area.
         *  Disadvantages:
         *  Sex offenders can provide false addresses and go underground.
         *   Vigilante  action  and  human  rights  violations  against  sex
           offenders.
         *  Mistaken identity.


         2.48    Phaphamani Rape Crisis Counselling Centre


         The Centre believes that its host town,  Uitenhage,  is  the  "rape
         capital" of South Africa and  that  this  perception  is  having  a
         negative effect on the town's economy.   They  also  highlight  the
         problems rape survivors face in terms of how they  are  treated  by
         society, especially those from disadvantaged  areas.  Some  of  the
         problems they highlighted in this regard include lack of  dignified
         debriefing rooms at  police  stations  as  well  as  problems  with
         District Surgeons, crisis kits, counselling and  support  for  rape
         survivors,  as  well  as  the  geographical  remoteness  of   these
         services for survivors.


         2.49    Professional Board for Psychology


         The Psychological Society of South Africa, the  Professional  Board
         of Psychology and members of the media are undertaking  a  research
         study in the sexually violent attacks against  minor  children  and
         will  work  in  close  collaboration   with   relevant   government
         departments and civil society institutions.  The study  will  cover
         the actual incidences of such attacks  against  children  under  10
         between 2000 and 2001 and the profiling of the perpetrators.   This
         report  will  be  available  in  March  2002.   The  research  team
         consists of numerous distinguished academics.


         2.49.1  Aim of the Study


         *  Adduce the actual incidence  of  attacks  against  pre-pubescent
           children i.e. those under ten years of age.
         *  Assess and profile alleged  perpetrators  to  better  understand
           the  factors  that  may  have  contributed  to   their   bizarre
           behaviour.


         2.49.2  Findings of the Study


         *  The six-nine year age group  appeared  to  have  been  the  most
           vulnerable to sexual abuse followed by the three-five  year  age
           group.
         *  The most likely age of perpetrators who commit  acts  of  sexual
           abuse are between 25-35 years old, followed by  the  35-50  year
           old age group.
         *  It is also important to note that the highest  rate  of  suicide
           is amongst men between the ages of 25-35 years.
         *  These findings have serious implications since  this  age  group
           constitutes the most economically productive  population  group.
           The 25-35 year age group is also regarded as the protectors  and
           providers in families.
        *  There is often an assumption that the increase in rape and child
           abuse  is  as  a  result  of  South  Africa's   new   democratic
           dispensation. This could not be further from the truth since  it
           is evident that the socialisation process of the 25-35 year  age
           group occurred during the 1970's and 1980's while Apartheid  was
           at its height.
         *  There is generally an  assumption  that  rape  is  committed  by
           someone that is known  to  the  survivor.  The  study  tends  to
           indicate that  most  of  the  perpetrators  had  no  significant
           relationship to the survivor.


         2.49.3  Recommendations


         *  Schools at  all  levels  should  be  targeted  by  an  awareness
           campaign to inform and educate children about sexual abuse.
         *  There is a need for the social affirmation of men.


         2.50    RAPCAN


         2.50.1  Problems


         *  The quality of statements taken by the SAPS is poor.
         *  The high number of cases being withdrawn.
         *  Confusion around the phasing out of District Surgeons.
         *  Difficulty in tracing sexual abuse and rape victims.
         *  Cost of travel expense for parents and families  of  victims  to
           courts.
         *   Inadequate  facilities  at  the  courts   such   as   lack   of
           interpreters and in-camera facilities.
         *  No separate waiting facilities for child victims.
         *  Lengthy trials.
         *  Under-reporting of child rapes.  According to RAPCAN the  actual
           number of children who are raped is about 20 times  higher  than
           the official statistics.


         2.50.2  Reasons for the high rape statistics of children:


         *  The high rate of interpersonal and community  violence  as  well
           as violence against women.
         *  Patriarchy and patriarchal values.
         *  Religious and cultural practices.
         *  Appalling history of human rights practices.
         *  History of oppression.
         *   Poverty  and  unemployment,  which  leads   to   a   sense   of
           powerlessness.
         *  Children under the age of 18 years are not deemed  to  have  the
           same rights as adults.


         2.50.3  Factors influencing low reporting rate:


         *  Parents do not have faith in the judicial system.
         *  Parents fear that the police will use  discretion  in  terms  of
           investigating the case.
         *  It is an economic and financial burden to take a case  to  court
           especially when there are long delays. These delays cause  cases
           to be withdrawn.
         *  Interpreters are not readily available and are not  accommodated
           for in the SALC Discussion Paper.
         *  Fear of secondary trauma.
           *     Lack of communication among service providers.


         2.50.4  Recommendations
         *  The legislation should provide for the category  of  'vulnerable
           witnesses'.
         *  The previous sexual history of a child should have  no  standing
           in court.
         *  Training should be given to  a  broad  range  of  caregivers  in
           order to replace the functions previously performed by  District
           Surgeons.
         *  Training should be given to all court staff.
         *  The expertise fee structure for personnel must change.
         *  A multi-disciplinary approach must be used  for  sexual  offence
           cases.
         *  RAPCAN supports the Draft Discussion Paper produced by the  SALC
           on Sexual Offences.
         *  The Criminal Justice System must be sensitised and trained  with
           regard to the disclosure of abuse.
         *  Blockages in the Criminal Justice System must be eliminated  and
           resources made available to combat child sexual abuse.
         *  Bail and minimum sentencing provisions should be tightened.
         *  A holistic approach must be used to deal with the problem.  This
           would  include  life  skills  training  at  schools  around  the
           country.
         *  There is a need to combat cultural stereotypes.
         *  Therapeutic services must be developed and expanded.
         *   There  should  be  focus  on  the  rehabilitation  of  juvenile
           offenders.
         *  There is a need to increase the arrest and conviction rates.
         *  Sentences should be severe.
         *  Need to recognise the long-term impact of child abuse.
         *    Need   more   effective   inter-sectoral   coordination    and
           cooperation.
         *  Investigate the establishment of expert Child Abuse Centres.
         *  Cultural notions must be combated.


         2.51    Regional Child Abuse Protection Committee -  KwaZulu  Natal
                 Midlands


         This submission outlines the meeting held between  this  group  and
         the Department of Social  Development  on  the  25  February  2002,
         where it was recommended that children who are subjected to  sexual
         assault and/or rape should automatically be given access  to  anti-
         retroviral  drugs  and  counselling  -  all  of  which  should   be
         facilitated and provided  free  of  charge  by  the  South  African
         Government.


         This was a joint submission by: Health  Services,  Law  Enforcement
         Officials, Welfare (State  and  NGO  sectors),  Justice  and  other
         Legal Representatives, operating within the KwaZulu Natal  Midlands
         Region.
         2.52 Santho-Qhokotswane, Mamokhothu


         Ms  Santho-Qhotswane  is  a  survivor  of  domestic  violence   and
         believes that domestic violence is the main  source  of  child  and
         sexual abuse.  Her  submission  includes  documents  detailing  her
         experiences of abuse by her husband and her four-year  struggle  to
         obtain justice. She points to inefficiency and  corruption  in  the
         police force and court officials in  Bloemfontein  as  reasons  for
         this.


         She notes that decision makers involved in  cases  of  abuse  often
         play a destructive role and cause further  trauma  to  the  victims
         because they lack sensitivity and empathy.


         The submission indicates that inefficiency and  corruption  in  the
         courts inhibit justice and protection of victims.  She argues  that
         women are still regarded as  inferior  and  seen  as  objects.  Her
         concern is that the children growing up in families where there  is
         violence and abuse see it as the norm.


             53. Shabangu, Jimmy


         Mr Shabangu is a Councillor of Ward 15  in  Middleburg,  Mpumalanga
         Province. His submission raises concerns about  the  poor  response
         and inefficiency  by  police  personnel  in  the  Middleburg  Child
         Protection Unit. The concern arises from  the  case  of  Ms  Deliwe
         Maseko, whose child was raped. Although the police  was  given  all
         the relevant information, the suspect was not arrested.


         Mr Shabangu lodged a formal complaint  with  the  Child  Protection
         Unit in December 2001and has not received any response to date.


         2.54    Shadow Pictures


         Shadow Pictures have  been  commissioned  by  the  BBC  to  make  a
         documentary  on  child  rape.  This  follows  the  television   and
         international press coverage of the rape of baby Tshepang. The  aim
         of the documentary  is  to  expose  the  issue  and  raise  certain
         questions.


         2.54.1  Problems


         *  The Western Cape had its first case of  baby  rape  reported  in
           May 1997.
         *  Since October 2001, seven other cases of  baby  rape  have  been
           recorded.
         *  CPU's in the Western Cape and Upington  work  with  very  little
           resources and they often start work at 3am. Many members of  the
           CPU are lost to stress.
         *  Child rape is not confined to a single race group.
         *  Where there is  poverty  and  unemployment  and  where  men  and
           children spend hours together  every  day,  there  is  a  higher
           incidence of child rape.
         *  The prospects of child rape increases where there  is  abuse  of
           alcohol and low self esteem.
         *  It appears that the notion that sex  with  a  virgin  cures  men
           with various diseases including  Aids  has  contributed  to  men
           seeking out small children and old women with whom to have  sex.
           Some Sangomas have also been spreading this idea.  Research  has
           shown that this notion has been prevalent for a while.
         *  Courts are slow to process cases and the sentences  often  don't
           befit the crime.
         *  Many perpetrators are also in  the  position  to  get  to  small
           children example educators and child minders.


         2.54.2  Recommendations


         *  It was suggested that the President should:
         *  Outline the problem and state that Government will not  tolerate
           the situation by giving new measures to protect children.
         *  State clearly that HIV and Aids cannot cured by having sex  with
           a virgin. Traditional leaders should also  provide  the  correct
           information.
         *  Reverse the Government's position on anti-retrovirals  for  rape
           victims.
         *  Children's courts must be established  across  the  country  and
           the process should be made child friendly.
         *  Encourage  and  register  street  committees,  which  were  very
           effective during apartheid. They must be empowered  to  responds
           to cases of abuse against women and children by  reporting  them
           to the appropriate structures.
         *  Initiate a campaign where men can value their  masculinity  with
           pride. Traditional ideas about ownership of women  and  children
           should be condemned.
         *  More resources and person power should be provided to the CPU.
         *  Women should be supported  in  their  efforts  to  mother  their
           children by, for example, having state funded  nursery  schools.
           This will ensure that mothers do not leave their children in the
           care of unemployed men when working.


         2.55    Sigwela, S G


         Mr. Sigwela's submission  raised  the  issue  of  sexual  abuse  of
         children within the family.  The  submission  makes  the  following
         points:


        *  The  lack  of  evidence  against  perpetrators  result  in  them
           becoming repeat offenders;
         *   There  is  an  apparent  lack   of   uniform   procedures   for
           investigating child rape cases at police stations;
         *   The  use  of  DNA  testing  immediately  after  the  rape  will
           facilitate prosecution;
         *  A fund should be set up for victims in order  for  them  to  pay
           for the DNA testing and other related medical expenses.


         2.56    Silangwe, Nozipho


         The  submission  highlights  the  need  for  strong  campaigns  and
         workshops to raise awareness about protecting children from  sexual
         abuse. The main source of child abuse is men and as most  men  have
         lost economic control and dominance over women they are taking  out
         their frustrations on weaker  persons,  which  are  children.  They
         also abuse children to fulfil their sexual fantasies.


         Awareness campaigns should target men so that they  will  recognize
         their responsibility and have a  positive  view  to  life  and  the
         rights of  children.   The  submission  recommends  that  key  male
         personalities and leaders should be used to campaign against  child
         and women abuse in order to achieve positive results.


         2.57    Smith, Charlene


         The submission  looks  at  the  role  of  society  in  creating  an
         enabling environment for dealing with rape. It focuses on the  role
         of parents, government, religious communities,  big  business,  the
         medical community, alcohol industry in dealing with the  child.  It
         illustrates  statistically  the  high  incidences  of  child  abuse
         accompanied by the low conviction rate of child abusers.


         Ms Smith argues that in most cases the majority of abusers are  not
         strangers but are persons known to the victims.  In  several  cases
         they are the caregivers of the abused children. The Child Care  Act
         addresses these issues but local  communities  need  to  take  more
         responsibility in enforcing the protection of children.


         The submission also looked  at  the  role  of  government  and  big
         business in providing the necessary  trained  personnel,  improving
         departmental budgets, providing forensic laboratories and  forensic
         kits to police stations and health workers, training personnel  and
         the provision of child care facilities.


         She criticises the current training of medical personnel and  calls
         for the improving of  rape  forensic  and  rape  care  training  at
         medical teaching  institutions.  It  calls  on  the  pharmaceutical
         companies to help fund the proposed training.


         The submission  suggests  that  there  is  a  strong  link  between
         violent crime and  the  use  of  alcohol.  It  quotes  the  Medical
         Research Council study that found alcohol as  a  common  factor  in
         60% of the murders reported last year. The document  proposes  that
         liquor manufacturers fund welfare, training  and  criminal  justice
         projects through the government tax or other levies imposed.


         It is reported that children who are abused  are  often  likely  to
         become  abusers  themselves.  The  submission  proposes  that   the
         Department of Education and  Correctional  Services  should  ensure
         that children do  not  go  to  jail  and  should  provide  adequate
         alternative  facilities.  The  presentation  argues  that  children
         should not be exposed to violence and abuse.


         The presentation  recommends  counselling  and  peer  mediation  in
         schools and  calls  for  the  establishment  of  trauma  groups  in
         schools. Teachers need to also be trained. Sexual violence  against
         children is inextricably linked to the high prevalence of  violence
         in our society.


         2.58    Social Workers' Association of South Africa


         2.58.1  Concerns and problems experienced


         The submission suggests that the current  system  of  handling  the
         sexual abuse of children is inadequate and further traumatises  the
         child. There are too few social workers with  specialised  training
         to deal with the survivor's immediate needs as well as  longer-term
         therapy. The coordination between social service agencies  and  the
         CPU is lacking, and there seems  to  be  no  recognition  that  the
         social worker is a professional equipped to  deal  with  a  child's
         emotional needs.


         The submission further notes that there was no  standard  interview
         protocol, that the medical personnel  are  sometimes  not  properly
         trained for this specialised  area  or  simply  too  thinly  spread
         especially in the rural areas.


         With reference to the court  system,  the  submission  states  that
         courts are not child-friendly and the court process takes much  too
         long. The survivor could be  exposed  to  the  perpetrator  because
         they have to use the same entrance to the court and  sometimes  the
         same waiting room. The manner in which the  testimony  given  by  a
         child is treated, suggests that members  of  the  legal  profession
         regard children as unreliable witnesses.


         Dealing with abuse on a  regular  basis  causes  severe  trauma  to
         social workers, who feel that they are fighting  a  losing  battle.
         This results in social workers feeling burnt-out.


         2.58.2  Recommendations


         *  South Africa should  implement  the  relevant  articles  of  the
           Convention on the Rights of the Child
         *  All matters relating to  offences  against  children  should  be
           heard in the High Court
         *  All sectors dealing with sexual abuse  should  receive  training
           in this specialised field
         *  Courts should  be  made  more  child-friendly,  for  example  by
           making use of one-way mirrors  in  interview  rooms  and  inter-
           mediators to protect survivors from perpetrators
         *  Children should have the right to legal representation
         *  Cases should be finalised within 4 to 6 weeks
         *   Social  workers  should  receive  recognition  and  support  in
           continually dealing with such negative issues a child abuse
         *   There  must  be  greater  co-operation  between  the  different
           professions that work in the interests of children


         2.59    Soul City


         The presentation was based on  the  knowledge  accumulated  through
         research on issues such as child  and  women  abuse,  HIV/Aids  and
         sexuality education.


         2.59.1  Problems


         *  Progress made with regard to policing, prosecution and  survivor
           assistance is not sufficient  to  deter  rapists  and  inculcate
           mutual respect between men and women.
         *  Child and infant  rape  is  an  extension  of  violence  against
           women. Perpetrators treat children with a sense  of  entitlement
           and children are objectified.
         *  Other problems include that women often take the blame  for  men
           raping children, they are often blamed for the rape of  children
           and gang rape is prevalent and referred to as a game.
         *  Whilst women have been empowered about  their  rights  this  has
           also made them vulnerable by not educating men at the same  time
           which has led to a backlash against women.


         2.59.2  Recommendations


         *  Working with men and boys is a priority and there is a  need  to
           promote men's programmes.
         *  Sexuality and gender education is crucial.
         *  Encourage parents to talk to their children.
         *   Ensure  that  teenagers  have  information  on   contraception,
           sexually transmitted disease and Aids and  are  aware  of  their
           options on the use of the Termination of Pregnancy Act.
         *  The myth that sex with a virgin cures Aids must be to  rest  but
           it should also be established whether the myth  is  driving  the
           increase in child rape.
         *  Do more research around perpetrators and why they  rape  because
           it is not paedophiles that are raping children and babies.
         *  Conduct  research  to  provide  information  on  the  facts  and
           statistics on child and infant rapes so that it  can  inform  an
           effective preventative programme of action.
         *  Expedite the  Child  Protection  Act  and  the  Sexual  Offences
           Amendment Act.
         *  A  safe  environment  should  be  ensured  to  protect  children
           against child abuse. This includes tackling poverty. A Consensus
           statement on Sexual  Abuse  has  been  compiled  and  signed  by
           approximately 12 children's rights advocacy groups and  provides
           guidelines on preventing child abuse.
         *  A national campaign against  abuse-  'Every  day  is  anti-abuse
           day'.


         2.60    South African Catholic Bishops' Conference


         2.60.1  Problems


         *  Moral breakdown in society. The most vulnerable in society  thus
           fall victim to those people who have lost their moral bearings.
         *  Social  factors  such  as  overcrowding,  unemployment,  alcohol
           abuse and broken families contribute to  the  problem  of  child
           abuse.
         *  De-humanisation of women takes various  forms  in  our  society.
           Gender relations are characterized by patriarchy and men tend to
           regard women and girls as possessions.
         *   Commodification  of   sex.    Advertising   and   entertainment
           industries  are  guilty   of   marketing   sex   and   sexuality
           commercially. Sex is thus turned into a product and  people  are
           encouraged to want this product.
         *  Lack of male involvement in addressing issues  of  child  abuse.
           It is mainly women social workers,  counsellors,  activists  and
           community workers that are addressing the problem.


         2.60.2  Recommendations


         *  Political leadership as well as  churches  and  other  religious
           bodies have  an  important  role  to  play  in  providing  moral
           leadership in the country.
         *  Men need to be educated to realize  that  women  are  autonomous
           and equal beings.
         *  The religious sector has a role to play in  the  way  that  they
           instruct their young people in the values of their faiths. There
           is a need  to  counter-act  the  commodification  of  women  and
           respond to the call for moral renewal.
         *  Education is important  and  programmes  can  be  introduced  to
           educate children and youth about appropriate forms of  behaviour
           and interaction. Educators should also be  trained  to  identify
           problems.
         *  Budget priorities should take the work  that  organizations  are
           doing into account and Government should  provide  organizations
           with the proper resources to address the problem.  Money  should
           be redirected at addressing and protecting children  from  abuse
           and not go towards arms.
         *  Partnership between non-government organizations and  Government
           is an important aspect of addressing the problem of child abuse.
         *  A dedicated  ministry  should  be  established  and  a  specific
           Cabinet portfolio be created to oversee children's  affairs.  It
           is suggested that funding for such a ministry could be  obtained
           from some of the tax relief money returned to the taxpayers.


         2.61    South African Human Rights Commission


         Advocate Tlakula presented the findings of the South African  Human
         Rights  Commission  (SAHRC)  Report  on  Sexual  Offences   Against
         Children to the Task Group. She indicated that the SAHRC  used  its
         mandate with respect to upholding  and  implementing  human  rights
         and held an inquiry to investigate  whether  the  criminal  justice
         system actually protects children.


         2.61.1  Findings


         *  The  criminal  justice  system,  currently  does  not  work  for
           children who have been abused.
         *  Children with disabilities face even greater trauma.
         *  Despite the initiatives put in place, these are insufficient.
         *  There are a number of individuals who put in an  amazing  amount
           of work. Their commitment is however not shared by everyone.
         *  There is confusion about the duty to report child abuse  due  to
           the duplication of mandatory reporting provisions in  the  Child
           Care Act and Prevention of Family Violence Act.
         *  Professionals such as teachers, doctors  and  dentists  fail  to
           report child abuse cases in accordance with the duty imposed  on
           them by legislation.
         *  There  is  a  poor  police  response  to  sexual  abuse  against
           children and a  failure  to  comply  with  national  policy  and
           protocol.
         *  The location of the limited  Child  Protection  Units  minimises
           accessibility to sexually abused children.
         *  Police report  difficulty  in  tracing  children  and  witnesses
           living in informal settlements.
         *  Evidence often gets lost between the examining  doctor's  office
           and the police station.
         *  The withdrawal of cases is a serious flaw in  the  policing  and
           the possible prosecution of sexual abuse cases.
         *  There is an extensive shortage of support  services  for  abused
           children.


         2.61.2  Recommendations


         *  A system that is premised on the best  interests  of  the  child
           needs to be developed.
         *   Sexual  violence  against  children  should  be  treated  as  a
           priority by government.
         *  National government has to  fast-track  the  legislative  review
           process  of  various  pieces  of  legislation  relating  to  the
           protection of children.
         *  Post exposure prophylaxis is to be dispensed  to  child  victims
           of sexual violence in all cases.
         *  More financial and human resources need to be made available  to
           implement programmes of action.


         2.62    South African Law Commission (SALC)


         2.62.1  Draft Sexual Offences Act


         2.62.1.1      Problems


         *  Inadequate implementation of the law. This includes the lack  of
           protective services in rural areas for children.
         *  Lack of training particularly of the judiciary, which  leads  to
           poor decision-making.
         *  Lack of resources, exacerbated by high case loads.
         *  Corruption, particularly  amongst  police  officers  influencing
           the high withdrawal level of cases.
         *  Child rape and sexual assault  is  complicated  in  that  it  is
           related to broader social problems, e.g. domestic  violence  and
           poverty.


         2.62.1.2      Recommendations


         1. Substantive Law - Deals with the definition of crimes.


         *  Rape is codified and is  free  of  gender  biases.  It  includes
           sexual penetration of genitals, anus and mouth 'when an  act  of
           sexual penetration occurs  under  coercive  circumstances'.  The
           focus is therefore on the coercive nature of the act and not  on
           consent.
         *  A new offence, compelled or induced indecent acts  is  contained
           in the draft bill.
         *  The age of consent is fixed  at  16  years  for  both  boys  and
           girls.
         *  Child prostitution is criminalized. They  are  protected  up  to
           the  age  of  18  years.  People  exploiting  children  can   be
           prosecuted.
         *  The draft Bill provides for extra-territorial jurisdiction.


         2. Process and Procedure - It deals with the management  of  sexual
                 crimes:


         a) Pre-trial


         *  The  Draft  Sexual  Offences  Act  contains  guiding  principles
           regarding  the  interpretation   and   implementation   of   the
           legislation. This principles attempt to protect  the  rights  of
           victims, their families and communities as well as to  ensure  a
           fair trial and management of the accused.
         *  There is a  need  for  the  co-ordinated  management  of  sexual
           offences and for inter-sectoral co-operation.
         *  Training  and  debriefing  of  all  professionals  working  with
           sexual offence cases is important.
         *  There is a need for SAPS to investigate all reported  cases  and
           not to accept withdrawal statements from victims.
         *  The State is responsible  for  providing  medical  examinations,
           treatment and therapy for sexual assault victims. The Department
           of Health is responsible for providing  prophylactic  medication
           for sexual assault victims including post-exposure  prophylactic
           medication for HIV/Aids.
         *  The legislation provides  for  the  creation  of  a  'vulnerable
           witness' category that is afforded protective  measures  by  the
           Court.


         b) Trial Process


         *  Enhance the intermediary system.
         *  Abolish the competency test.
         *  Abolish the cautionary rules.
         *  They do not recommend the use of videotaped interviews.
         *  Increase the use of expert witnesses.
         *  Appoint support persons to support victims.
         *  Increase the use of specialised assessors.


         c) Post-trial Process


         *  Establish a sentencing council.
         *  Increase the use of Victim Impact Statements.
         *   The  offender  should  pay  compensation  to  victim   wherever
           possible.
         *   Rehabilitation  of  the  offender  should  be   combined   with
           punishment.
         *  SALC does not recommend the development of  a  sexual  offenders
           register and community notification legislation.
         *  SALC does not recommend the chemical castration of offenders.
         *  Recommends that the application for dangerous  sexual  offenders
           orders be issued when a sexual offender is released from prison.


         2.62.2  Child Care Legislation


         The legislation deals with a range of children's  issues  including
         child sexual abuse. The focus of the  legislation  is  on  children
         rather than perpetrators  and  therefore  is  does  not  deal  with
         criminal law aspects of the punishment of offenders.


         2.62.2.1      Key provisions of the Act:


         *   It  defines  parental  responsibilities  rather  than  parental
           rights in order to make parents more accountable in the law  for
           their behaviour and for what  they  allow  to  happen  to  their
           children under their care.
         *  There are enabling and mandatory reporting clauses in  the  Act.
           A  professional  must  report  children  in  need  of  care  and
           protection.
         *  Immunity is given to encourage reporting.
         *  Reasons must be given for failure to report and  failure  to  do
           so will be punished.
         *  The Act makes provision for strengthening the capability of  all
           personnel involved in child  sexual  abuse  cases,  for  example
           training.
         *  Hearings focusing on the  abuse  of  children  should  be  heard
           simultaneously with hearings on compensation.
         *  Children's courts can now also  recommend  that  social  workers
           receive an order to investigate and search premises.
         *  Local Government also has a role  to  play  in  amongst  others,
           keeping  records  on  children  in  need,  inspection  of   care
           facilities, etc.


         2.63    South African National Council for Child Welfare


         The submission was made in the  context  of  there  not  being  any
         systematic collection of national figures on  child  sexual  abuse.
         It was stated that 5000 cases  of  sexual  abuse  were  dealt  with
         annually at the 166 Child Welfare  societies  across  the  country.
         The most fundamental issue that needed to be  dealt  with  was  the
         manner  in  which  children  are  viewed  and  perceived.  It   was
         submitted that children were currently viewed as inferior and as  a
         commodity.


         2.63.1  Causes of Sexual Violence


         *  The  myth  that  sex  with  a  virgin  will  cure  HIV/Aids  has
           progressed into a significant problem.
         *  The disempowerment of women and children  causes  them  to  bear
           the brunt of discrimination and violence.
         *  Poverty affects both men and  women  resulting  in  feelings  of
           hopelessness as well as alcohol and drug abuse.
         *  There is a  strong  link  between  poverty  and  the  commercial
           sexual exploitation of children.
         *  There appears to be a  decline  in  the  moral  fibre  of  South
           Africa.


         2.63.2  Factors Preventing Effective Service Delivery


         *  The Department of Social Development makes inadequate  financial
           resources available to NGO's preventing them from  carrying  out
           their work effectively.
         *  Essential human and financial resources have to be put in  place
           to achieve the goals set out in new legislation and policy.
         *  There are various intersectoral gaps.
         *  The health sector has failed to provide  adequate  training  and
           facilities needed to combat child abuse.
         *  There are a lack of resources,  training  and  Child  Protection
           Units.
         *  Courts and court procedures do  not  adequately  facilitate  the
           smooth processing of sexual abuse cases.
         *  Life skills training in schools is limited or absent.
         *  The NGO sector has no formal representation  on  the  structures
           of the National Plan of Action for Children.
         *   There  are  various  plans  of  action  for  children  in   the
           President's Office but nothing is being done to implement this.


         2.63.3  Recommendations


         *  A National Intersectoral Child Protection  Strategy  has  to  be
           developed immediately.
         *  Resources have to be provided to  ensure  that  new  legislative
           requirements are complied with.
         *  Provision should be made for the establishment of  intersectoral
           infrastructure.
         *  Government departments should take note of problems  experienced
           by NGO's.
         *  Initiatives such as the sexual offences court must  be  tracked,
           evaluated and monitored.
         *  Appropriate diversion and treatment programmes for  perpetrators
           must be developed.
         *  The register of sex offenders should be seriously considered.
         *  The present programmes and structures of the  National  Plan  of
           Action should be reviewed to include NGO representation.
         *  The percentage of the Department of Social Development's  budget
           used to fund NGO's is inadequate and has to be reviewed.
         *   Underspending  and  rollovers  within  the   National   Poverty
           Alleviation Strategy and other programmes are unacceptable.
         *  The financing policy has to be improved.
         *  The poor salaries paid to social workers must be improved.
         *  The existing National  Committee  on  Child  Abuse  and  Neglect
         should develop and implement its terms of reference.


         2.64    Standing Together to Oppose Pornography (STOP)
         The mission of STOP is to promote a society in which  children  are
         nurtured in an environment of sound  family  values  and  in  which
         women and children in particular are protected from  sexual  crime,
         sexual exploitation, abuse and violence in  accordance  with  their
         constitutional  rights.   STOP   opposes   the   proliferation   of
         pornographic  and  related  sexually  explicit  material  that  has
         become available since 1994.


         The  organization  notes  that  the  Films  and  Publications   Act
         contributed  to  the  creation  of  a  social  climate  of  "sexual
         freedom" which degenerated into a culture of "anything goes."


         They oppose the availability  of  pornographic  material  and  feel
         that the internet is a great source of  pornography,  which  should
         be obstructed. They note that young  boys  are  vulnerable  to  the
         effects of pornography. The  television  has  also  contributed  to
         altering standards of sexual behaviour by pushing the  limits  from
         the sexually suggestive to overt pornography.


         The submission states that  rape  of  children  can  no  longer  be
         viewed as predominantly an act of violence rather that a  crime  of
         motivated by passion or lust. With  the  decline  in  standards  of
         sexual behaviour, "date rape" has increasingly become  common,  and
         the  rape  of  school  children  by  teachers,  for  instance,  are
         unlikely  to  be  attributable  to  the  underlying  need  of   the
         perpetrator to commit an act of violence.  Like  drugs  pornography
         has an addictive effect, followed by an escalation in the need  for
         "stronger" material. Overtime, desensitisation  occurs  and  lastly
         there is an increased  tendency  to  put  into  action  the  sexual
         activities  seen  in  the  pornography.  Thus  fantasy  can  become
         reality  -  especially  dangerous  to  the  community   where   the
         addiction has been to child pornography.
         Dr William Marshall, a respected child psychologist stated that  87
         per cent of girl-child molesters and  72  per  cent  of  boy  child
         molesters regularly use pornography and  86  per  cent  of  rapists
         regularly used pornography and  57  per  cent  copied  pornographic
         scenes in the commission of rape.  In  a  10-year  study,  the  Los
         Angeles Police Department found  that  in  60  per  cent  of  child
         molestation cases, adult or child pornography was used  to  destroy
         the conscience of the  child  and  teach  them  to  model  perverse
         behaviour.


         Closer to home, in the Western Cape  an  Attorney-General's  Office
         stated that every case of consensual child abuse  she  had  handled
         involved the use of pornography. A 1991 study by the  Institute  of
         Child and Family Development revealed that prostitution is rife  in
         South Africa, and escalating since our country became  known  as  a
         premier sex-tourism destination.


         2.64.1  Recommendations


         *  In searching for the causes  of  the  escalation  of  rape,  the
           mindset of the rapist is due for appraisal;
         *  Review of the Films and Publications  Act.  For  example:  books
           and magazines of a pornographic nature should  be  submitted  to
           the Films and Publications Board prior to publication. That  is,
           classification should not be complaints-based as at present;
         *  Expansion of the duties of the Films and Publications  Board  to
           deal  with  television  material.  This  situation  prevails  in
           Netherlands;
         *  Expansion of  the  Films  and  Publications  Board's  powers  to
           include the law enforcement in liaison with the Police;
         *  Review of  the  Business  Act  in  order  to  legislate  tighter
           requirements for  the  establishment  of  Adult  premises  ("Sex
           Shops") by e.g.: stringent licensing requirements, limitation of
           numbers in a given area, and by land-zoning. Such measures could
           be passed on, as is presently the case, via Provincial  law  and
           local government that, by its nature, allows for  direct  public
           participation. (Note zoning by-laws  are  already  operative  in
           East London);
         *  Enforcement of the Broadcast Act. The  electronic  media  should
           be compelled to adhere to the fine Code of Conduct as  contained
           in the Broadcast Act. At present the Act  appears  to  have  not
           "clout" where contravention of the Code is concerned;
         *   Establishment  of  a   user-friendly,   well-advertised   route
           (including a toll-free phone line) for the  public  to  complain
           about offensive/harmful television and radio broadcasts.
         *  A public hearing should be set up by the Portfolio Committee  on
           Communications as matter of urgency to facilitate public  debate
           on the programme content of the electronic media;
         *  The appointment by the SABC of a suitably  qualified  person  to
           advise on programme content;
         *  Setting up of a user-friendly service to enable  the  public  to
           complain about contravention of the Films and Publications Act;
         *  Public Education and  dissemination  of  information  about  the
           possible dangers  of  pornography.  Members  of  the  Films  and
           Publications Board may  be  trained  to  carry  out  this  task,
           jointly with the Department of Education;
         *  Students in institutions of higher learning to be encouraged  to
           conduct research around pornography and its harmful  effects  in
           society through  dissertations  and  theses.  In  the  meantime,
           government can commission a study to do the same, and produce  a
           report within six months. The Human  Sciences  Research  Council
           may be able to carry out such study.


         2.65    Third Law


         Third Law is a protest action group of concerned community  members
         responding to the rape of baby Tshepang last year.  The  Third  Law
         submission argues that the causes of  child  rape  include  alcohol
         abuse, the criminal justice system namely  the  ineffectiveness  of
         bail,  consequences  not  proportionate  to  the  crime   in   that
         criminals are jailed at the expense of tax payers.


         2.65.1  Recommendations


         *  The state providing more resources and expertise to  the  police
           services. Increasing the number  and  improving  the  skills  of
           police officers;
         *  The government must ensure  child  sensitive  courts  and  court
           personnel;
         *  Establishing  support  networks  for  the  families  of  victims
           including financial and trauma counselling;
         *  Strengthen/ enforce the punitive measures  of  prison  sentences
           and deny bail;
         *  Rehabilitation programmes must not include child rapists.


         2.66    Tjabane, Thembeka


         The presenter, from  the  Free  State  Province,  related  evidence
         based on her own experience. She presented two cases.


         Case 1:


         In the  first  case,  a  child  was  abused  by  her  uncle,  which
         ultimately resulted in her pregnancy. She  is  currently  13  years
         old. The case was reported to SAPS but withdrawn on  the  basis  of
         lack of evidence.


         Case 2:


         Ms Tjabane is acting  as  a  foster  parent  to  five  children  in
         addition to her own two but has been unable to  access  the  foster
         grant.


         2.66.1  Recommendations


         *  The pregnancy of the child should serve as prima facie  evidence
           of abuse.
         *  Bail should not be given in sexual abuse cases.


         2.67    Trollip, J E


         The submission focuses on existing  laws  and  the  role  that  the
         community can play to eradicate the problem of child sexual  abuse.
         It argues that the existing laws do not give communities an  active
         role in dealing with child sexual abuse. It raises a concern  about
         the discretionary nature of the Magistrate's  Court  Amendment  Act
         No: 67 of 1998, which provides for the summoning of  assessors  who
         are reliable and capable persons from the community. This needs  to
         be corrected. Another concern is that in reality the assessors  are
         not being regularly summoned for child abuse cases.


         The submission  also  raises  a  concern  about  the  low  rate  of
         conviction  of  perpetrators   of   child   sexual   abuse.   Where
         perpetrators are convicted, the sentences  are  often  lenient  and
         thus not sending a strong messages to potential offenders.


         2.68    UN Child Justice Project


         The project provides technical  assistance  to  the  South  African
         Government for the implementation of  the  proposed  child  justice
         legislation.
         The submission focused on:


         *  The need for  an  early  intervention  and  prevention  approach
           towards child sex offenders.
         *  The inherent dangers of criminalizing child sex offending.
         *   The  proposals  of  the  Child  Justice  Bill  on  the  use  of
           programmes for diversion  and  alternative  sentencing  for  sex
           offenders.
         *  Availability and use of programmes for child sex  offenders  and
           gaps in the delivery of programmes as an early intervention  and
           preventative measure.


         2.68.1  Problems


         *  Research has shown that  between  50%  -60%  of  all  adult  sex
           offenders  commit  their  first  sexual  offences  as  children.
           Children who commit these offences are aged between  13  and  17
           years and most are males. In the total sex offending population,
           children are still a small percentage of  those  committing  the
           offence.
         *  Children do not always understand  the  implications  of  sexual
           acts, even when they are hurting other children, as sex is  part
           of the adult world. This may be as a result of acting out things
           done to them by adults or older children.
         *  Criminalisation of  sex  offending  could  drive  the  behaviour
           underground due to the shame, guilt and stigma  associated  with
           sex offenders.


         2.68.2  Legislation - Child Justice Bill


         The Bill proposes the following:


         *  That children who are accused of crimes  be  dealt  with  in  an
           individualized way.
         *  That children who at the time of the offence is  below  the  age
           of 10 cannot be prosecuted.
         *  Children between the ages of 10-14, do not have the capacity  to
           appreciate the consequences of  their  actions.  They  therefore
           have to  be  treated  cautiously  and  receive  the  appropriate
           treatment instead of being criminalized.
         *  Between the ages of 14-18  years  there  is  the  assumption  of
           criminal capacity but other factors such as age of the  offender
           and victim, should be taken into account.
         *   Promotes  the  rights  of  victims  through  the  use  of   the
           restorative justice process.
         *   The  emphasis  is  on  the  use  of  diversion  programmes  and
           alternative sentencing.
         *  Alternative sentencing applies to those children who do not  get
           diverted. They thus stand trial.


         2.68.3  Recommendations


         *  Diversion for many sex offenders would be an appropriate way  to
           deal with them. This does not imply  that  they  should  not  be
           taken  through  the  criminal  justice  system.  But  children's
           developmental capacity and age has to be considered.
         *  Need to ensure that programmes are in place to deal  with  child
           sex offenders. Currently there is a gap in the  availability  of
           specialized programmes. The two that are run are by Childline in
           Durban and SAYSTOP in the Western Cape.
         *  Systemic approach to preventing child abuse  should  be  adopted
           and it involves working with the children who commit the crimes,
           their families, and other systems that they interact  with  such
           as the school, peers and the media.
         *  Child sex offenders should be seen as a unique  population  with
           special needs that can be addressed through  early  intervention
           treatment  efforts.  Research  has  shown  that  treatment   and
           prevention will prevent child sex offenders from becoming  adult
           sex offenders.


         2.69    United Christian Action
         2.69.1  Problems


         *  The legalisation of pornography - sex offenders and  paedophiles
           are linked to pornography;
         *  The liberalisation of laws controlling  prostitution  -  younger
           children are lured into the sex slave industry;
         *  Existing laws on abortion which make abortions  more  accessible
           to young girls;
         *  Proposed changes to the Marriages Act by the South  African  Law
           Commission (SALC) which would  change  the  age  requirement  of
           entering into a partnership;
         *  Proposed changes to the Child Care Act which  would  legalise  a
           child's "right to confidential contraception and abortion";
         *  Proposed legalisation of shebeens;
         *  Legislation on gambling.
         *  Curriculum 2005, which deals  specifically  with  the  "sexually
           explicit nature of the mandatory sex education  imposed  on  all
           children regardless of choice and freedom"
         2.69.2  Recommendations


         *  The current Planned Parenthood sex education  be  scrapped  from
           all South African Schools and in its  place,  a  pro-abstinence,
           pro-family and pro-marriage sex education be implemented;
         *  Parents must be allowed more authority in determining  when  and
           how their children should be taught sex education at schools;
         *  The mandatory clause on exposure to  sex  education  courses  in
           classes should be reviewed  -  parents  must  be  aware  of  the
           teaching materials and context in which the syllabus is taught;
         *  Other alternatives of making children aware of sexuality  should
           be investigated, such as the role of the religious institutions;
         *  The testing of values through state  specified  outcomes  should
           be scrapped, as this is unethical.
         *  All existing laws/legislation must consider the moral impact  on
           children and to crucially address this;
         *  Pornography and prostitution must  be  criminalised,  with  both
           the user and "subjects' criminalised;
         *  A more efficient way of  arresting  and  punishing  rapists  and
           child abusers should be formulated;
         *  All  offenders  should  be  equally  treated,  be  it  teachers,
           police, politicians and must be liable  for  prosecution  should
           they violate the law.


         2.70    University of Fort Hare. Department of Private Law


         The submission was based on empirical research done in the  greater
         King Williams Town area. Visits were  made  to  the  Department  of
         Justice offices where cases of child abuse  are  reported.  One  of
         the primary aims of the research was to identify gaps in the  legal
         process and to examine some of the contributing factors.


         2.70.1  Causes and contributing factors


         *   Myths  about  transferring  incurable  diseases  by  adults  to
           children, as has been the case with HIV/Aids stories recently;
         *   Element  of  genetics  whereby   dysfunctional   behaviour   is
           transferred to another generation;
         *  Power dynamics, which result in  men  dominating  women  and  in
           this process gaining some sexual satisfaction;
         *  Perpetrators themselves may have been assaulted but received  no
           treatment resulting in passing  on  this  consequence  to  other
           victims.


         2.70.2  Legal considerations


         *  The legal adoption process  is  biased  in  favour  of  economic
           sustainability of  the  adopting  parents.  Few  other  parental
           qualities are considered which could serve the best interest  of
           the child.
         *  Ineffective sentences handed out. The terms often fail to  serve
           the purpose of having a deterrent effect.
         *  Often the legal maintenance enforcement leads to adults  abusing
           children.


         2.70.3  Recommendations


         *  Longer sentences should be meted out;
         *  Children should be removed where possible  to  safer  places  of
           care with stringent and justifiable conditions.


         2.71    University of Zululand


         The presentation notes  that  rape  and  child  rape  is  a  direct
         consequence of the silence prevalent  in  our  society.  The  paper
         argues that children do not have  a  voice  and  that  the  justice
         system downgrades their legal evidence. Other causes of child  rape
         cited include: paedophilia, financial dependence, sleeping  with  a
         virgin  can  cure  Aids,  sexual  awareness  of  children  and  the
         misguided sex education of children.


         The  paper  recommends  that  children  should  not  be  placed  in
         alternative places  of  care,  as  this  can  constitute  secondary
         victimization. It  is  further  recommended  that  the  perpetrator
         should be placed  in  a  rehabilitation  programme  and  forced  to
         provide for his family and the sustainability of such a  programme.
         If the perpetrator did not have a job then  the  person  should  be
         sentenced to a minimum of five years.  The  paper  also  recommends
         that trials take place  within  24  hours  and  that  children  can
         testify by closed circuit cameras.


         2.72    Van Rensburg, Pat


         The submission argues that there is a link between pornography  and
         the abuse of women and children. It details a number  of  newspaper
         reports from across the world that would suggest that the  majority
         of rapists  use  pornography,  and  that  their  habit  of  viewing
         pornography  is  at  the  root  of  the  violent  rape  that   they
         perpetrate. The violent sexual scenes are  said  to  be  the  model
         that the rapist attempts  to  emulate  what  can  be  seen  in  the
         pornographic material he habitually looks at.


         The submission also argues that pornography is addictive  and  that
         it gives rise to tendencies of sexual sadism,  because  the  person
         who has become addicted to pornography eventually needs to act  out
         the deviant behaviour depicted in the material.
         In addition, the submission deals with the use  of  pornography  in
         child abuse, noting that in a substantial number  of  sexual  abuse
         cases, the perpetrator  showed  the  abused  children  pornographic
         material as a coercive device.
         The submission does not make any recommendations.


         2.73    White, Rose


         The submission highlights the inadequate public relations  campaign
         on child rape issues. Although  issues  around  sex  and  Aids  are
         covered extensively in schools  and  on  television,  there  is  no
         strong  preventive  component  in   the   message   conveyed.   The
         perception exists that people offering  this  guidance  in  schools
         are not properly trained and the facilitation used is not  adequate
         for the classroom. She feels that children need to be  informed  of
         their rights and about  what  to  do  should  they  be  raped.  She
         suggested that research should  be  done  to  look  at  comparative
         statistics of South African child rape  cases  compared  to  Africa
         and the rest of the world.


         2.74    Women Against Children and Community Abuse  (WACCA)  Advice
                 Centre
         2.74.1  Causes of Child Rape


         *  There is no communication between children and mothers.
         *  Alcohol and drugs play a significant role  in  cases  of  sexual
           abuse.
         *  The myth that raping  a  virgin  will  cure  HIV/Aids  persists.
           Cases of this nature continue to be reported by communities.
         *  Unemployment and poverty causes children to  accept  lifts  from
           strangers on their way to school. This is one  of  the  ways  in
           which abuse can occur.


         2.74.2  Gaps in Existing Legislation


         *  Cases are withdrawn for various reasons. This issue needs to  be
           addressed.
         *  Cases are postponed for long periods and  instead  needs  to  be
           fast-tracked.
         *  Acquittals, due to a lack of evidence, need to be investigated.


         2.74.3  Recommendations
         *  Harsher sentences for rapists. It is  suggested  that  sentences
           for sexual abuse and rape should be at least 20 years.
         *  Women should attend support groups in communities to teach  them
           how to talk to their children.
         *  The Crime Protection Unit should be situated outside the  police
           station. Police officers who run these Units should  not  be  in
           uniform.
         *  Cases cannot be prolonged in court and ways  have  to  found  to
           reduce the time it takes to prosecute perpetrators.
         *  Those who neglect children should be sentenced  to  correctional
           supervision and undergo training on how to treat children.

         This submission  is  based  on  a  journal  article  entitled  "The
         History of Child Abuse" written by  Lloyd  deMause  in  1998  which
         chronicles child abuse from ancient times  to  the  present.  Child
         abuse has been depicted as a cycle, which is  difficult  to  break.
         Parents themselves have to work through their  own  childhood  pain
         if this cycle is  to  be  broken.  The  reasons  why  children  are
         abused,  issues  of  causation  and  intervention   in   terms   of
         supporting parents and teaching parenting is explored in  detailed.
         Within each culture  and  nation  child  abuse  occurs  in  various
         forms.  This  may  range  form  sexual  to  physical  violence  and
         neglect.


         Childrearing practices, and the role of the mother  and  father  in
         supporting child development are integral to solving  some  of  the
         problems encountered. Various modes of  childrearing  ranging  from
         projectionist to socialization are mentioned.


         2.75.1  Recommendations


         *  Community parenting centres has  proven  successful  in  various
           parts of the world. This concept is based on  volunteer  labour,
           small capital outlays and is tremendously cost effective;
         *   Teaching  "parenting"  should  be   incorporated   into   adult
           education programmes;
         *  Social resources  need  to  be  effectively  channelled  towards
           consciously assisting the evolution of childrearing.


         3  The Task Group's Findings and Recommendations


         3.1     Introduction


         South Africans all over the  country  have  been  united  in  their
         condemnation of sexual violence against children.  This  nationwide
         condemnation of sexual violence was apparent in the  large  numbers
         of individuals and organisations that  contributed  to  the  public
         hearings despite the considerable  time  constraints  within  which
         the process was concluded. The contributions have been  of  a  high
         standard, and the Task Group's understanding  of  sexual  abuse  of
         children has been enhanced by each of these contributions.


         The Task  Group  finds  that  the  incidence  of  sexual  abuse  of
         children in South Africa is unacceptably  high.  More  than  twenty
         thousand cases of abuse were reported to the South  African  Police
         Service in 2001, and statistics of  reported  cases  of  abuse  are
         very similar for the preceding years. The  Task  Group  notes  with
         particular concern the suggestion that the abuse reported  is  only
         a fraction of the real incidence.


         There is often an assumption that the increase in  rape  and  child
         abuse is a result of South Africa's  new  democratic  dispensation.
         However, it was argued before the Task Group  that  the  phenomenon
         is not new, and that  the  real  difference  since  the  democratic
         transition has been that there has  been  a  greater  openness  and
         awareness on the issue of children's rights, with the  result  that
         children and communities speak out about  abuse  more  readily.  In
         addition, there has been a much higher level of media  coverage  of
         incidences of child abuse.


         In relation to international  trends,  the  Task  Group  notes  the
         global report of the International Tribunal for  Children's  Rights
         released in 2001, which stated that despite  the  nearly  universal
         ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the  Child,  all
         indications are that violence against children worldwide is on  the
         increase.


         Before proceeding to more specific  findings  with  regard  to  the
         different sectors involved in the protection of children, the  Task
         Group notes that it is necessary to understand the sexual abuse  of
         children in its broader social context, nature, and magnitude,  and
         to develop interventions for primary prevention and  prevention  of
         its long-term consequences.


         3.1.1   Socio-economic factors


         Some presenters suggested that child  abuse  occurs  in  particular
         socio-economic  conditions.  However,  a  study  that   took   into
         consideration the  effect  of  socio-economic  conditions  and  its
         relationship with abuse, found that  sexual  abuse  occurs  in  all
         communities irrespective of socio-economic  status.  This  argument
         was supported by a number of other presenters, who  indicated  that
         there is no simplistic  linear  relationship  between  poverty  and
         abuse, although abject social conditions, together  with  substance
         abuse, may contribute to abuse.


         The Task Group finds that the socio-political and economic  history
         of the country has impacted  negatively  on  family  and  community
         life, resulting in a society  characterised  by  extreme  forms  of
         violence.   Conditions    of    social    deprivation    contribute
         significantly to  the  erosion  of  self-esteem,  causing  loss  of
         respect for the right that women and children have to sexual  self-
         determination. Such conditions also impact on  women's  ability  to
         protect themselves and their children against  an  abusive  partner
         or father.


         There have been suggestions that mothers, who allow their  children
         to be abused, must be  liable  for  prosecution.  While  not  in  a
         position to  come  to  a  conclusion  on  the  matter  of  criminal
         liability for those persons who are  aware  of  abuse  but  do  not
         prevent it, the Task Group finds that dependency on an  abuser  may
         prevent either the abused child or an adult family  member  who  is
         aware of the abuse from reporting the abuse; this applies  to  both
         emotional and economic dependency. The Task Group also  finds  that
         in situations where the  family  has  no  access  to  reliable  and
         affordable   childcare   services,   this   increases    children's
         vulnerability to sexual abuse.


         Another factor that has been linked  to  the  incidence  of  sexual
         violence  against  children  is  alcohol   and   substance   abuse.
         Submissions have argued that being under the influence  of  alcohol
         or drugs erodes people's ability to respect  themselves  and  those
         around them. The Task Group  recognises  that  in  the  context  of
         alcohol and drug abuse children are particularly at risk of  abuse.




         3.1.2   Societal attitudes


         It was argued that dominant attitudes around  the  power  relations
         between men and  women  contribute  to  women  and  children  being
         viewed as objects or possessions. The Task  Group  finds  that  the
         distorted  patriarchal  attitudes  men  have  towards   women   and
         children contribute to the latter being vulnerable to all forms  of
         violence. It notes the argument in  one  of  the  submissions  that
         South Africans have yet to  fundamentally  interrogate  patriarchal
         notions of power relations between  men  and  women,  such  as  the
         right of the man as head of the household to exercise his power  as
         he sees fit.


         The Task Group finds that while Section  9  of  the  South  African
         Constitution guarantees equality  for  all  its  citizens,  at  the
         level of the family and the community this  has  to  be  translated
         into the universal acceptance of the  inalienable  right  of  women
         and children not  to  be  subjected  to  abuse,  whether  physical,
         emotional or sexual. These rights also find  their  expression  for
         instance in Article 27 of the African Charter  on  the  Rights  and
         Welfare of the Child and Article 34 of the  UN  Convention  on  the
         Rights of the Child.
         The Task Group heard a number of proposals that  speak  to  longer-
         term solutions to the rebuilding of the social  fabric.  Among  the
         submissions on the matter were arguments that  stated  that  sexual
         violence against children  is  an  extension  of  violence  against
         women. Efforts at eradicating sexual abuse  would  therefore  focus
         on,  among  others,  changing  attitudes  through  sustained,  mass
         campaigns that challenge the way men see women, and how  women  see
         themselves.


         Representatives from the faith-based  sector  suggested  that  this
         sector has a particular role to play in the way  that  they  impart
         the values of their faith  to  young  people.  This  would  include
         teaching  equality  between   men   and   women,   condemning   the
         commodification of women and educating  children  and  youth  about
         appropriate forms of behaviour and interaction.


         A significant number of submissions focused on the  need  for  long
         term public campaigns aimed at raising awareness  of  sexual  abuse
         and informing the public in  general  and  children  in  particular
         about sexual abuse and children's  right  to  be  heard  when  they
         report abuse. The Task Group  finds  that  the  silence  concerning
         sexual violence, has a negative impact  on  children's  ability  to
         disclose abuse, and that it is critical that  children  are  taught
         and encouraged to speak out about abuse. It  also  finds  that  the
         process of changing attitudes and behaviour is likely to take  many
         years, and that strategies  aimed  at  reducing  the  incidence  of
         child rape must take this into account.


         Many of the submissions to the Task Group suggested that  the  myth
         stating that sex with a virgin cleanses a  man  of  HIV/Aids  is  a
         major factor in the incidence of child rape. The Task  Group  notes
         the comments by researchers from the Medical Research Council  that
         would indicate that there are some  serious  misconceptions  around
         the incidence of baby rape and its link to HIV/Aids.  Although  the
         idea that having sex with a virgin cleanses you of Aids does  exist
         in South Africa, and there have been reported cases of  this  as  a
         motivating  factor  for  child  rape,  the   predominant   evidence
         suggests that this is infrequently the case.  The  MRC  researchers
         further argue that there is no evidence overall  that  any  of  the
         recent  infant  rape  perpetrators,  some   of   whom   have   been
         apprehended, knew that they were HIV-positive.


         The Task Group also heard  from  presenters  who  argued  that  the
         practice of virginity testing was potentially harmful to  girls  in
         that it makes them vulnerable to being raped within the context  of
         this myth.


         The  Task  Group  recognises  the  importance  of  the  role   that
         traditional healers play  in  communities'  efforts  to  cope  with
         HIV/Aids. It further acknowledges that  traditional  healers  could
         add a powerful voice to the message that sex with a  virgin  cannot
         cure any person who has been infected with  HIV,  and  that  public
         awareness campaigns around living with HIV could benefit  from  the
         contributions of traditional healers. The Task Group  commends  the
         statement made  by  a  gathering  of  600  traditional  healers  at
         Vlakplaas from 15-17 December 2001 where  they  emphatically  state
         that HIV/Aids can never be cured by having  sex  with  children  or
         babies, young girls who have not reached puberty, or older women.


         3.1.3   Recommendations


         The Task Group recommends -


         *  that developmental programmes address the needs  of  communities
           holistically, paying attention to strengthening social cohesion,
           making neighbourhoods safe, supporting vulnerable  families  and
           tracking developments in particular communities.
         *  that developmental programmes that aimed at offering  unemployed
           mothers  employment,  have  built-in  mechanisms  through  which
           provision is made for safe childcare facilities for the children
           of those mothers at work.
         *  that HIV/Aids messages  take  into  account  the  importance  of
           traditional  and  alternative  medicine  in  the  South  African
           context. It  further  recommends  that  the  health  authorities
           target the community of  traditional  healers  with  a  view  to
           establishing a relationship of trust that  will  allow  for  one
           unequivocal message concerning the treatment of HIV/Aids.
         *  that social ills such as alcohol and other substance  dependency
           must be addressed as part of  a  broader  preventative  strategy
           that  focuses  on  rebuilding  communities   and   strengthening
           families.
         *  that a  sustained  public  awareness  campaign  be  launched  by
           Government in order to highlight the importance of community and
           individual responsibility for the safety of all children in  all
           communities.


         3.2     Social Development Services


         3.2.1   Introduction


         Much was said at the  hearings  about  the  role  that  the  social
         service sector in South Africa should play in preventing  abuse  as
         well as protecting the child survivor of  abuse.  This  section  of
         the  findings  will  focus  on  the  preventative  role  of  social
         development services.


         Although the Task Group does  not  find  that  there  is  a  direct
         correlation between socio-economic conditions and child  abuse,  it
         is of the opinion that particular conditions of social  deprivation
         contribute  to  rendering  children  more  vulnerable   to   abuse.
         Addressing  abuse  at  the  level  of  prevention  therefore  means
         addressing some  of  the  socio-economic  difficulties  that  South
         African communities experience.


         There are a number of  government  programmes  that  are  aimed  at
         providing developmental services to communities.  Policy  documents
         like the 1997 White Paper on Social Welfare or the National  Policy
         Framework for Families, which although still in a draft  form,  are
         clear about the paradigm within which services to  families  should
         be provided. However, the budgetary allocation  to  the  Department
         of Social Development seems to suggest that there  is  little  room
         for  full  implementation  of  programmes   envisaged   in   policy
         documents because 90% of the budget is  currently  being  spent  on
         social security benefits.


         In view of the policy thrust towards family preservation and  early
         intervention,   the   Task   Group   notes    that    unfortunately
         interventions which tend  to  disrupt  family  life,  such  as  the
         removal of children from their families,  are  still  more  readily
         available than  those  that  are  aimed  at  prevention  and  early
         intervention.


         The Task Group recognises that there is a lack of  coordination  of
         services between  the  different  government  agencies.  Presenters
         repeatedly noted that the lack of coordination was one of the  main
         obstacles to tackling the issue  of  sexual  violence  effectively,
         and it was suggested  that  resources  are  not  effectively  spent
         because of a possible duplication of services. There was  a  strong
         call for the completion and implementation of the National Plan  of
         Action for Children, as well as the  implementation  of  the  Draft
         Strategy on Child Abuse and Neglect. The Task Group finds that  the
         responsibility for services to vulnerable children  are  fragmented
         between  the  Presidency,  the  national   Department   of   Social
         Development, the provincial Departments of  Social  Development  as
         well as the child  protection  agencies  in  the  criminal  justice
         system.  It  finds  that  there  is  little  coordination   between
         Departments and no clear consensus on who is responsible for  which
         service. Nor  is  there  a  clear,  integrated  strategy  for  both
         preventative  and  protective  interventions  to  ensure   adequate
         provision of services.


         The Task Group notes the  concern  raised  in  various  submissions
         that social workers have to  deal  with  extremely  high  caseloads
         under often very difficult circumstances. Social  workers  tend  to
         react  to  situations  of  abuse  but  are  unable   to   implement
         preventative strategies; it was  further  suggested  that  in  many
         instances, the reactions are  too  late.  Various  presenters  also
         focused on the difficulties caused  with  regard  to  morale  among
         social  service  professionals  because  of  the  low   levels   of
         remuneration in relation to their training and the volume  of  work
         expected of them. The Task  Group  finds  that  these  difficulties
         have a severe impact on the effectiveness of  those  services  that
         are in place. It also  finds  that  the  current  caseloads  hamper
         organisations'  ability  to  advance  community  development  work,
         which is one of  the  areas  identified  as  a  possible  site  for
         preventative programmes.


         The availability of safe accommodation  for  children  in  need  of
         care is one of the critical elements in both the  preventative  and
         protective service framework. Civil society  organisations  provide
         a significant portion of these safe houses; there is also a  system
         where members of  the  community  make  their  homes  available  to
         accommodate children in distress. Presenters from this sector  have
         argued that there seems to be little  State  recognition  of  their
         contribution in this regard. The Task Group is of the opinion  that
         it  is  the  State's  responsibility  to  provide  a  sound  policy
         framework for this service, and to support  and  fund  the  service
         adequately.
         The Task Group is of the opinion that  preventative  services  such
         as family preservation  programmes,  parenting  skills  programmes,
         child care programmes for single working  parents,  and  programmes
         that focus on alcohol  and  substance  abuse  could  contribute  to
         addressing  some  of  the  conditions  that  make   children   more
         vulnerable to abuse. It further finds that  these  services  should
         be provided in an integrated manner in  order  to  make  them  most
         effective.


         However, this requires  that  there  be  a  clear  agreement  among
         stakeholders such as social workers, police  officers  and  medical
         personnel on the nature of the services to be provided,  and  clear
         agreement on who  has  the  responsibility  for  which  aspects  of
         services.  It  also  requires  that  adequate  resources  are  made
         available to ensure that services like the  24-hour  service  pilot
         programme, which provides for social  workers  to  be  on  call  to
         assist police officers in cases of child abuse, can be  rolled  out
         to all the provinces. There must also be clear  efforts  to  target
         the disparity in resources  and  services  between  the  urban  and
         rural areas.


         3.2.2   Legislative framework


         The Child Care Act  (Act  No  74  of  1983)  provides  the  primary
         legislative framework through which children are protected  by  the
         State. However, it focuses mainly on interventions  after  a  child
         has been abused or found in need of care.


         Section 11 of the Act provides for the  removal  by  way  of  court
         order of a child at risk of significant harm. In terms  of  Section
         42 certain categories of professionals like  health  care  workers,
         social  workers  or  teachers  must  report  the  suspected   "ill-
         treatment" or "injury" of any child. However, this section  of  the
         Act is silent  about  which  aspects  of  ill-treatment  constitute
         sexual abuse; in fact, the Act does not mention sexual abuse  as  a
         distinct form of abuse that may require  particular  responses.  In
         addition, Section 50 states that any person who ill-treats a  child
         shall be guilty of an offence; however,  this  section  is  equally
         silent on the specific issue of sexual abuse. The Task Group  finds
         that these are serious omissions in the Act,  especially  in  light
         of the obligations that South Africa has under Article  16  of  the
         African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and  Article
         19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.


         The removal clauses in the Child Care Act (Sections 11 and  12)  do
         not make provision for the abuser to be removed  from  the  child's
         immediate environment, but rather for  the  child  to  be  removed.
         This seems to be in conflict with the concept expressed  in  policy
         that every attempt must be made to allow the  child  to  stay  with
         the family, and therefore this omission may  not  be  in  the  best
         interest of the child. The Task Group is  of  the  opinion  that  a
         provision similar to that in Section 7  of  the  Domestic  Violence
         Act (Act No 116 of 1998) with  regard  to  protection  orders,  for
         example, which  make  specific  provision  for  the  abuser  to  be
         removed from the environment in which the child lives, may have  to
         be considered during deliberations on a new children's statute.


         The question of reporting abuse  was  mentioned  repeatedly  during
         the hearings, with presenters making the point that the  provisions
         of the Prevention of Family Violence  Act  (Act  No  133  of  1993)
         create confusion about the obligation to  report  abuse.  The  Task
         Group notes that there is considerable divergence in the debate  on
         reporting, with proposals going as far as saying that  persons  who
         are aware of or  facilitate  the  occurrence  of  a  rape  must  be
         prosecuted even if they did not directly participate in  the  rape.
         There  have  also  been  proposals  that  persons  outside  of  the
         categories of professionals listed in legislation be  compelled  to
         report abuse, and that any person who fails to report abuse  should
         be guilty of an offence.


         Another  proposal  was  that  new  children's   legislation   limit
         mandatory reporting to certain professional  categories.  The  list
         of professionals that would be  compelled  to  report  abuse  would
         need to be refined during the legislative process.  The  submission
         further proposes voluntary  reporting  for  persons  outside  these
         specific categories. In view of the damage that  could  ensue  from
         wrongful reporting of abuse, the Task  Group  finds  this  position
         with regard to reporting the most reasonable.


         3.2.3 Civil   Society Organisations


         A very substantial portion of social development  work  is  carried
         out by civil society organisations,  and  the  Task  Group  accepts
         that Government alone is not in a position to do all  the  work  in
         this  field.  However,  a  large  number  of   organisations   have
         registered their concern that the relationship  between  the  State
         and civil society organisations  is  characterised  by  significant
         difficulties.


         Civil society  organisations  have  a  critical  role  to  play  in
         providing services to our communities. This role will be  optimised
         if  there  is  a  clear  understanding   of   partnership   between
         Government  and  civil  society   organisations.   The   challenges
         organisations faced in  accessing  funding  are  having  a  drastic
         impact on the effectiveness with which services are delivered.


         The financing regime in  relation  to  organisations  is  currently
         unclear, with the  result  that  they  are  struggling  to  provide
         services at their past level, or to expand services  into  formerly
         under-serviced areas. The Task Group takes note of  the  Department
         of  Social  Development's  commitment  to  finalising  a  financing
         policy that is clear, accessible and that will foster an  equitable
         distribution of resources for the provision of  social  development
         services. However it notes that in the absence of  such  a  policy,
         the work of a substantial number of organisations is threatened  by
         financial instability.


         Presenters referred to the fact that the  National  Lottery  should
         have provided civil society organisations with  funding,  but  that
         the distribution of funds has been slow  to  get  off  the  ground.
         Very  serious  questions  can  also  be  asked  about  how  funding
         decisions are  made,  considering  the  fact  that  social  service
         organisations that have emerged in disadvantaged  areas  are  still
         being under-resourced. The Task Group finds that  in  view  of  the
         importance  of  social  service  delivery,  it  is   difficult   to
         understand the rationale behind awarding large sports  associations
         that  have  ready  access  to  private  sector  sponsorships  large
         amounts of money from the National Lottery Fund.


         The Task Group notes that a number of the  organisations  of  civil
         society are  not  functioning  effectively  because  they  are  not
         rooted  in  the  communities  that  they  serve.  Many   of   these
         organisations were established in  a  pre-democratic  South  Africa
         and are still in the process of transforming  the  paradigm  within
         which they  work  to  suit  the  current  context.  Linked  to  the
         question of transformation is also  the  issue  of  whether  social
         service professionals are appropriately trained.


         The Task Group is aware that a number of organisations  are  making
         use of volunteers to assist social workers in  dealing  with  cases
         of child abuse, neglect and family care. The Task Group is  of  the
         opinion that the use of volunteers could  assist  significantly  in
         getting  communities  involved  in  fighting  abuse   and   raising
         awareness of abuse in communities, and that  it  is  important  for
         professionals in  the  social  services  sector  to  recognise  and
         acknowledge the value of volunteers who  do  not  necessarily  have
         tertiary  education.  However,  it   finds   that   the   volunteer
         programmes  must  be  managed  in  such  a  manner  that  continued
         training  is  available  to  volunteers  who  work  in  this   very
         difficult and sensitive area, and that they  must  have  access  to
         ongoing support to assist them to deal with the  emotional  effects
         of working in the area of child abuse.


         It also notes that there is still a  large  disparity  between  the
         provision of services in urban areas and those in rural areas.


         3.2.4   Recommendations
         The Task Group  recommends  in  relation  to  the  legislative  and
         policy framework


         *  that the Department of Social Development  ensure  that  process
           of writing a comprehensive new children's statute  is  completed
           as soon as possible, and that particular attention be  given  to
           provisions that deal explicitly with sexual abuse.
         *  that the question of mandatory reporting  of  abuse  be  located
           only in the children's statute in order to eliminate ambiguities
           around reporting obligations.
         *  that the children's statute expresses itself clearly  concerning
           the right and responsibility of child  protection  practitioners
           in various disciplines to undertake  routine  investigations  in
           response to allegations of abuse and neglect before a case comes
           to court.
         *  that the legislation be explicit with regard  to  the  provision
           of preventative services to families, and that Government take a
           clear policy position to phase in services and  to  ensure  that
           funding for such services is secured.
         *   that  the  Department  of   Social   Development,   when   they
           investigate the  financial  implications  of  the  SALC  Project
           Committee 110 proposals with regard to the provision of services
           at the local government level, give  serious  attention  to  the
           most effective system of funding services at this level.
         *  that the Department of Social  Development  finalise  the  Draft
           National Policy Framework for Families  and  translate  it  into
           clear programmes of action with concurrent  timeframes  for  the
           implementation of these programmes. It further  recommends  that
           these programmes be adequately funded,  and  that  the  critical
           need for preventative programmes be brought to the attention  of
           National Treasury to ensure that budgetary  allocations  to  the
           Department allow for the implementation of policy objectives.
         *  that the Presidency brief the relevant Parliamentary  Committees
           on the implementation status of the National Plan of Action  for
           Children, with specific reference to the  prevention  of  sexual
           abuse of children.
         *  that the Department of Social  Development  brief  the  relevant
           Parliamentary Committees on the status of the Draft Strategy  on
           Child Abuse and Neglect with a  view  to  the  finalisation  and
           implementation thereof as soon as possible.


         The Task Group recommends in relation to social services -


         *  that the Department of Social  Development  brief  the  relevant
           Parliamentary Committees on its programme for the  establishment
           of one-stop 24-hour Child Abuse Centres.
         *  that the Department of Social  Development  brief  the  relevant
           Parliamentary Committees on the functioning and effectiveness of
           the National  Child  Protection  Register  as  a  tool  for  the
           prevention of sexual abuse of children.
         *   that  the  Department  of  Social  Development  strengthen  its
           partnership with the civil society organisations as  it  relates
           to the provision of social  services,  and  that  it  gives  due
           recognition to the contribution that this sector  is  making  in
           this regard by providing it with adequate funding and support.
         *   that  the  Department  of  Social  Development  re-examine  the
           subsidies given to civil society organisations so that they  are
           able to focus on a more developmental approach  with  regard  to
           services and to attract appropriately skilled staff.
         *  that the Department of Social Development finalise  a  Financing
           Policy for the Provision of Social  Development  Service  within
           the timeframe set out in the National Estimates  of  Expenditure
           for 2002/2003, and that it report to the relevant  Parliamentary
           Committees on progress made in this regard.
         *  that  the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry  ensure  that  the
           Distributing Agency for the National Lottery Fund reconsider its
           funding priorities in view of  the  critical  need  for  greater
           allocations to the social development sector and  in  particular
           organisations that provide services to families and children.
         *  that the South African Council for  Social  Service  Professions
           (SACSSP) reports to the  relevant  Parliamentary  Committees  on
           progress made with  regard  to  the  promotion  of  professional
           boards for social development professions on a bi-annual basis.
         *  that the SACSSP brief the relevant Parliamentary  Committees  on
           progress made with regard to the transformation of  training  of
           social   service   professionals   in   accordance   with    the
           developmental social welfare approach, including the  retraining
           of registered professionals.
         *  that urgent attention be given to the improvement of  conditions
           of service with respect to all social service  professions,  and
           that the SACSSP provide all social service employers with  clear
           and binding guidelines in this regard.
         *  that the Department of Social Development  in  cooperation  with
           the Department of Education and any  other  relevant  Department
           explore the possibility of using  existing  infrastructure  like
           school premises for the establishment of  social  networks  that
           include not only students but  the  community  as  a  whole  and
           integrating the developmental programmes of  organisations  from
           all different sectors of society.


         The  Task  Group  recommends   in   relation   to   civil   society
         organisations -


         *  that Government in partnership with civil society  organisations
           develop a national protocol to ensure  that  there  is  a  clear
           strategy for improving the interaction among  all  organisations
           working with abused children.
         *  that the involvement of local communities  in  preventing  child
           abuse should not be limited mainly to  voluntary  participation,
           but  that  local  government  structures  must  be  utilised  to
           strengthen  programmes,  for  example  by  assisting  with   the
           identification of children who are  particularly  vulnerable  to
           abuse, and to intervene early  to  prevent  abuse,  neglect  and
           exploitation.
         *  that Government support civil  society  organisation  programmes
           aimed at ensuring that volunteers are appropriately  trained  to
           assist in dealing with the problem of child abuse.


         3.3     Education


         3.3.1   Introduction


         A 1998 study by the  Medical  Research  Council  (MRC)  found  that
         school teachers perpetrate 33% of rapes against children  under  15
         years. The release of  these  statistics  has  caused  considerable
         concern among education  authorities  and  members  of  the  public
         alike. And although the Task Group notes that reliable data on  the
         extent of sexual abuse in South African schools is  hard  to  find,
         there is compelling evidence, such as highlighted in the MRC  study
         to indicate that both  the  nature  and  levels  of  abuse  require
         immediate and urgent action.


         According to the MRC, not only is the girl's body violated  through
         sexual abuse in  schools,  but  also  her  right  to  education  as
         enshrined in  Section  29  of  the  Constitution,  and  in  various
         international instruments such as  the  International  Covenant  on
         Social, Economic and Cultural Rights (Article 10). Many  girls  are
         forced to leave school because of pregnancies fathered by  teachers
         and because of harassment by teachers. A girl's  ability  to  reach
         her economic and social potential is reduced, which may  impact  on
         her subsequent vulnerability to  being  dependent  on  sex  or  the
         abuser for economic survival.


         The Task Group was informed that this type  of  research  does  not
         suggest that  the  incidence  of  sexual  abuse  in  South  African
         schools is significantly higher than in other countries. It  should
         be acknowledged, however, that  the  incidence  of  children  being
         abused in schools is enough to raise serious concern.


         3.3.2   Legislative Framework


         The amendment to the Employment of Educators  Act  (Act  No  76  of
         1998) should  enable  education  authorities  to  combat  abuse  in
         schools. This Act provides for the dismissal of a teacher  who  has
         been found guilty of engaging  in  a  sexual  relationship  with  a
         learner, with or without the consent of such learner. In  addition,
         the South African Council for Educators Act (Act  No  31  of  2000)
         allows for the deregistration of a teacher when  such  teacher  has
         been found guilty of the sexual abuse of a learner.


         The Task Group was informed that despite the legislative  framework
         and a number of programmes and guidelines that have been  developed
         by the Department of Education, the situation in some  schools  has
         not  necessarily  improved,  and  enforcement  still   presents   a
         substantial challenge.  A  recent  study  conducted  by  the  Human
         Sciences Research Council indicated  that  there  are  considerable
         differences in the manner in which schools respond  to  allegations
         of abuse perpetrated by both teachers  and  learners.  Some  showed
         zero tolerance, with set disciplinary  procedures  and  structures,
         and strong links with  Social  Development  offices  and  the  SAPS
         Child  Protection  Unit.  Other  schools  used  verbal  reprimands,
         random corporal punishment  of  learners  (which  is  illegal)  and
         parental summonses, while some showed no response at all.


         At the same time, the Task Group must note the announcement by  the
         South African Council of  Educators  that  it  has  deregistered  a
         number of educators found  guilty  of  sexual  abuse  of  learners,
         because it is  of  the  opinion  that  this  form  of  action  will
         contribute to changing the patterns of abuse prevalent in  schools.
         It encourages the Council to apply all the legislative measures  at
         its disposal to ensure that educators who are deregistered in  this
         manner are not able to teach in South  African  schools  again.  It
         also encourages  the  Council  to  continue  speaking  out  against
         sexual abuse in schools.


         The difficulty education authorities have in  enforcing  provisions
         in legislation include a  lack  of  openness,  ambiguous  attitudes
         towards violence against girls, and the lack of  clear  definitions
         and preventative procedures. The Task Group therefore welcomes  the
         Department of Education's plan to ensure a common understanding  of
         what constitutes sexual harassment through  the  development  of  a
         national sexual harassment policy.


         3.3.3   Life Skills Education


         Much of the discussion around the education system focused  on  the
         manner in which educational  programmes  and  curricula  impact  on
         public  awareness  of  sexual  abuse.  There  have  been  differing
         opinions as to the nature and content of the life  orientation/life
         skills learning area, with  some  presenters  arguing  for  greater
         openness about sexuality, while other presentations submitted  that
         pro-abstinence, pro-family and pro-marriage  sex  education  should
         replace the current sex education programmes in schools.
         The Task Group finds that the school environment  is  an  extremely
         important  arena  in  which  to  raise  consciousness  about  human
         rights, gender equality and sexuality.  It  recognises  that  there
         are  divergent  views  about  the  content  of  sex  education  but
         supports the principle that learning areas should  be  designed  in
         such a manner that they foster the ability of  learners  to  engage
         with material in a critical and independent manner. The Task  Group
         therefore cautions against a retreat into silence and denial  where
         issues of sexual abuse are concerned.


         The Task Group was not presented with any research to suggest  that
         there is a causal relationship between sex education and  learners'
         greater vulnerability  to  sexual  abuse;  the  contrary  has  been
         suggested by several  commentators,  namely  that  the  ability  to
         understand the relationship between  sexuality  and  power  enables
         more children to speak out about abuse.
         3.3.4   Recommendations


         The Task Group therefore recommends -


         *   that  the  Department   of   Education   brief   the   relevant
           Parliamentary  Committees  on  the  progress   made   with   the
           implementation of the guide on Managing  Sexual  Harassment  and
           Gender-based  Violence  in  all  provinces,  as  well   as   the
           distribution to all schools  of  the  Departmental  workbook  on
           Signposts to Safe  Schools.  This  guide  should  make  explicit
           reference to the protection of the learner's right to  education
           by allowing him or her to remain at the same school without  the
           danger of victimisation.
           *     that  the  Department  brief  the  relevant  Parliamentary
           Committees on the mandate, powers and budget of the Special Task
           Team that the Department plans to establish for  the  monitoring
           of the implementation of legal and  policy  instruments  in  the
           school system.
         *  that the Department brief the relevant Parliamentary  Committees
           on the Safe Schools Project with reference to the  effectiveness
           of this programme in mobilising community participation  in  the
           improvement of safety at schools,  and  with  reference  to  the
           manner in which this programme has fostered the establishment of
           partnerships between  the  Department  of  Education  and  other
           government departments.
         *  that where interdepartmental partnerships are initiated  by  the
           Department of Education with the aim to combat child  abuse  and
           offer protection to children who have been abused, the  work  of
           such partnerships be facilitated through  adequate  funding  and
           the  provision  of  those  services  necessary  to  make   these
           partnerships effective.
         *  that schools at all levels be targeted by an awareness  campaign
           to inform and educate children about  sexuality,  sexual  abuse,
           responsible sexual behaviour and HIV/Aids.
         *  that the Department of Education commission  research  to  gauge
           the  extent  to  which  its  life  skills  education  programmes
           contribute to the prevention of sexual abuse in schools  and  in
           the community.


         3.4     Health issues related to sexual abuse of children
         3.4.1   Introduction


         The Task Group notes that a large number of submissions focused  on
         a myth present in the country that having sex with a  virgin  cures
         HIV/Aids, which is  said  to  cause  some  infected  men  to  abuse
         children. The Task Group is not able to establish whether the  myth
         has a significant influence on the number  of  instances  of  child
         rape seen recently in South Africa or whether it is  only  in  rare
         cases an underlying reason for abuse. In view of  the  severity  of
         the consequences, however, if a single case  emerges  out  of  this
         perception, it is one too many. Therefore, the Task Group wants  to
         reiterate that all indications from research are  that  having  sex
         with a virgin does not cure HIV/Aids. It also commends  once  again
         the clear and  unified  statement  that  a  significant  number  of
         traditional healers have made in this regard.


         The Task Group has heard that sexual abuse of  children  carries  a
         high risk  of  infecting  the  children  with  HIV/Aids  and  other
         sexually transmitted diseases. The  abuse  can  lead  not  only  to
         infectious disease, but also  to  pregnancy.  Either  carrying  the
         pregnancy to term or obtaining an abortion could  lead  to  serious
         health and emotional problems.


         The  Task  Group  also  heard  submissions  that   suggested   that
         practices such as virginity testing exposes young girls to  a  high
         risk of sexual abuse. Especially  for  the  already  abused  child,
         such practices enhance the possibility of  further  stigmatisation,
         trauma and suffering. In this instance, the  Task  Group  wants  to
         recall Article 21 of the African Charter on the Rights and  Welfare
         of the Child, which obliges South Africa to strive  for  the  total
         elimination  of  all  "harmful  social   and   cultural   practices
         affecting the welfare, dignity, normal growth  and  development  of
         the child".


         3.4.2   Medical response to abuse


         Presenters have pointed out that gaps in the  responses  by  police
         and medical personnel with regard to the immediate health needs  of
         the sexually abused child lead to situations where the health  risk
         for the child is increased. Some presenters have argued  that  this
         is due to inadequate training and a  lack  of  sensitivity  on  the
         part of these personnel. In these circumstances, the  abused  child
         faces the risk of secondary abuse.


         It was also pointed out that especially in rural areas,  facilities
         for reporting and treating the abused child are  not  available  or
         easily accessible. Presenters informed the  Task  Group  that  they
         often simply clean the child, rather than to wait for the child  to
         be examined by a medical  doctor.  There  also  appears  to  be  no
         clarity about which level of medical personnel would be  authorised
         to treat a survivor of  abuse  while  at  the  same  time  securing
         credible forensic evidence that will  contribute  to  a  successful
         prosecution in cases where a district surgeon  is  not  immediately
         available to see the survivor. The Task Group was further  informed
         that in some cases survivors are simply refused medical  attention.
         Section 28(1)(c) of the Constitution recognises the  child's  right
         to  basic  health  care  services.  These  should  include  medical
         treatment for the sexually abused  child.  Without  treatment,  the
         physical, mental and developmental well-being of the  child  is  at
         serious  risk,  and  without  evidence  such  as  blood  and  semen
         samples, the case may be  seriously  compromised.  The  Task  Group
         therefore recognises that in the absence  of  adequately  resourced
         facilities  and  proper  evidentiary  training  for  the   relevant
         medical personnel, and clear guidelines  concerning  the  needs  of
         rape survivors, such survivors may be suffering secondary abuse  at
         the hands of those who must care for them.


         3.4.3   Recommendations


         The Task Group recommends -


         *  that the Department of Health  launch  an  information  campaign
           aimed at ensuring that communities and all health  professionals
           be informed of the fact that medical treatment for the  sexually
           abused child forms part of the child's  right  to  basic  health
           care services in terms of Section 28(1)(c) of the Constitution.
         *   that  the  Department  of  Health  ensure  a   more   equitable
           distribution of infrastructure to allow for access  to  suitable
           treatment  facilities  across  the   Republic.   This   includes
           comprehensive and informative counselling on all health  related
           issues  around  infectious  disease  prevention  and  treatment,
           reproductive rights and pregnancy.
         *  that the Department of Health  ensure  that  all  survivors  and
           their caregivers are kept fully informed about all  the  medical
           procedures they are likely  to  undergo  and  the  health  risks
           resulting from the sexual abuse.
         *   that  HIV/Aids  prophylaxis  be  provided  without  charge   to
           survivors of sexual abuse where appropriate, and that  survivors
           be  encouraged  to  return  for  results,   repeat   tests   and
           counselling.
         *  that the Department of Health strengthen  its  partnership  with
           the community of traditional healers with a view to co-operating
           in the fight against popular and dangerous  misconceptions  with
           regard to sexual abuse of children.
         *  that the Department of Health, through  the  Health  Professions
           Council of South  Africa,  ensure  that  all  medical  personnel
           involved in caring for and examining survivors of child abuse be
           trained on and sensitised about their needs, in order to prevent
           secondary abuse.
         *  that the Department of Health, through  the  Health  Professions
           Council  of  South  Africa,  ensure   that   medical   personnel
           responsible for dealing with survivors of  abuse  be  adequately
           trained  in  forensic  medicine  to  ensure  that  good  quality
           evidence is meticulously documented as rapidly as possible.
         *  that the Department of Health brief the  relevant  Parliamentary
           Committees on its programmes to ensure that survivors of  sexual
           abuse do not suffer secondary abuse at the hands of the  medical
           officers charged with examining  and  treating  them,  and  that
           medical personnel have clear guidelines as to  their  respective
           responsibilities  with  regard  to  reporting  abuse,   treating
           survivors and securing evidence.


         3.5     Criminal Justice System


         The Task Group recalls and emphasises that in all  cases  involving
         child survivors and/or witnesses, the best interest of  the  child,
         as required by Section 28 (2)  of  the  Constitution,  as  well  as
         international instruments  such  as  the  African  Charter  on  the
         Rights and Welfare of the  Child  in  its  Article  4  and  the  UN
         Convention on the Rights of the Child in its Article  3  forms  the
         guiding principle  in  all  decisions  made  in  relation  to  such
         children.


         3.5.1   South African Police Service
         3.5.1.1 Introduction


         A number  of  presenters  felt  very  strongly  that  the  criminal
         justice system  is  not  conducive  to  protecting  the  rights  of
         survivors of abuse,  and  in  fact  suggest  that  survivors  often
         suffer  secondary  abuse  at   the   hands   of   insensitive   and
         inappropriately trained police officials. It appears, for  example,
         that  there  is  little  cognisance  among  police  officials  that
         disclosure of abuse is a complex process, and not a one-off  event.
         In many cases, survivors do not have ready  access  to  counselling
         support in a child-friendly environment, despite the efforts  being
         made to equip police stations with facilities  for  survivors.  The
         Task Group acknowledges that the police service  is  engaged  in  a
         transformation process, and  that  the  establishment  of  a  human
         rights culture - including a child rights culture  -  with  members
         of the South African Police Service is part of that  transformation
         process. It further acknowledges that resource  constraints  impact
         on the process of equipping police stations  with  facilities  that
         cater for the needs of survivors  of  sexual  violence,  especially
         crucial in previously under-resourced areas.


         Despite  very  hard  work  by  committed  police   personnel,   the
         discrepancy between the numbers of actual reported cases  of  abuse
         and conviction statistics for rape  and  sexual  offences  suggests
         that  the  majority  of  reported  cases   are   not   successfully
         prosecuted. It was repeatedly reported  that  cases  are  withdrawn
         because of a lack of evidence, or in  cases  where  the  prosecutor
         was of the opinion that the prosecution  of  the  matter  would  do
         significant  harm  to  the  survivor.  The  situation  is   further
         compounded by the incidence of corruption  among  police  officers,
         which has a direct influence on the high rate of case  withdrawals.
         The Department  of  Safety  and  Security  argued  that  it  was  a
         decision of the  prosecuting  authority  to  withdraw  cases  where
         there was insufficient evidence to secure  a  conviction,  and  the
         Report will address this issue in the Section that deals  with  the
         justice system. However, the Task Group is of the opinion that  the
         police have an equally  important  responsibility  to  ensure  that
         through investigative work, adequate evidence is gathered  to  make
         successful prosecution possible.


         The Task  Group  welcomes  the  establishment  of  the  new  Family
         Violence, Child Protection and Sexual  Offences  Units  (FCS),  and
         expresses the hope that these units will be established in as  many
         provinces as possible to ensure that  there  is  a  more  equitable
         distribution  of  this  very  crucial  resource.  The  Task   Group
         acknowledges that the strain  on  SAPS  resources,  exacerbated  by
         extremely high caseloads, impedes  the  law  enforcement  agencies'
         ability to properly follow up cases and secure sufficient  evidence
         to ensure convictions.


         3.5.1.2 Review of the Sexual Offences Act:


         The Task Group recognises that the Sexual  Offences  Act  is  under
         review, with an aim to strengthening the definition and  scheduling
         of sexual offences. The Task Group supports proposals that rape  be
         codified and defined free from gender bias. The criminalisation  of
         commercial sexual exploitation of children  in  addition  to  other
         forms of sexual exploitation should also assist  in  combating  the
         growing trend of vulnerable children becoming the victims  of  this
         form of exploitation  within  as  well  as  across  South  Africa's
         borders. Specific reference to this  issue  will  be  made  in  the
         section of this Report that deals with international  treaties  for
         the protection of children, and on commercial sexual exploitation.
         The  Task  Group  supports   further   proposals   concerning   the
         management of the  pre-trial  process.  It  has  been  argued  that
         secondary abuse of survivors  results  from  the  fact  that  South
         Africa has no clear strategy for  inclusively  dealing  with  child
         and adult survivors  of  sexual  offences,  either  on  a  primary,
         preventative level or on a secondary, protective  level.  There  is
         therefore  no  guarantee  that  a  survivor  of  a  sexual  offence
         entering the criminal justice system will be dealt  with  in  terms
         of acceptable procedures or be  protected  from  further  harm.  In
         view of this, the Task Group supports the proposal with  regard  to
         the development of a basic framework or code of conduct,  contained
         in the Sexual Offences Act, within which  multi-disciplinary  teams
         deal with cases of abuse.


         3.5.1.3 Recommendations


         The Task Group recommends
         *  that the amendments to the Sexual  Offences  Act  be  tabled  in
           Parliament as soon as possible, and  that  this  legislation  be
           processed as a matter of priority  to  ensure  that  a  national
           strategy for dealing with abuse at the  level  of  the  criminal
           justice system can be  developed  and  implemented  as  soon  as
           possible.
         *   that  the  legislation  address  the  need  for   intersectoral
           cooperation  between  the  police,  medical  personnel,   social
           service professionals and justice officers.
         *  that Schedule 6 of the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act (Act  No
           85 of 1997), which legislation deals with conditions of bail, be
           amended to include the rape of boys under 16.
         *  that sexual consensual relations with a male under  the  age  of
           16 years be criminalised as statutory rape.
         *  that the Department of Safety and Security  brief  the  relevant
           Parliamentary Committees with regard to  the  implementation  or
           completion of the its programmes aimed at improving  the  manner
           in which members of the SAPS  deal  with  sexual  offences.  The
           Department must also be clear about who will be responsible  for
           the implementation of these timeframes.
         *  that the Department of  Safety  and  Security  prioritise  in  a
           programmatic manner the roll-out  of  facilities  and  equipment
           aimed  at  providing  for  the  needs  of  survivors  at  police
           stations.
         *  that the Department of Safety and Security ensure that both  the
           Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences  Unit  and
           the Child Protection Units are adequately funded to extend their
           work in the provinces where the need is the greatest.
         *  that the Department strengthen its disciplinary  procedures  for
           instances  where  police  officials  are   implicated   in   the
           obstruction  of  a  sexual  offence  matter  either  by  way  of
           ineffective police work or corruption.


         3.5.2   Court system


         3.5.2.1 General issues and effective prosecution


         The Task Group finds  that  there  is  cause  for  serious  concern
         around the manner in which cases  involving  the  sexual  abuse  of
         children are dealt with in the court  system.  Seemingly  divergent
         standards and procedures for both survivors and  witnesses  suggest
         that the South African criminal justice  system  does  not  have  a
         clear and integrated approach to  criminal  offences  of  a  sexual
         nature. What further compounds  the  situation  is  the  fact  that
         rural communities do not have ready access to courts,  which  makes
         participation  in  a  court  process  a  sometimes  expensive   and
         challenging experience.
         Survivors of rape and other forms of sexual abuse  are  often  made
         to endure lengthy court proceedings  under  circumstances  that  do
         not necessarily cater to their emotional needs.  Justice  officials
         are not always  appropriately  trained  in  dealing  with  child  a
         witness, which makes it more difficult for such court officials  to
         make appropriate  decisions  concerning  the  competence  of  child
         witnesses.


         The Task Group heard different arguments  concerning  the  role  of
         technology in  effective  prosecution  of  cases  involving  sexual
         violence. In relation to DNA testing, for example, some  presenters
         argued that  the  service  should  be  decentralised  in  order  to
         expedite the prosecution of alleged offenders. However, it must  be
         noted that such decentralisation would have cost implications  that
         have  to  be  carefully  considered.  Furthermore  decentralisation
         could result in the compromising national standard of  DNA  testing
         and undermine the value that this kind  of  evidence  can  have  in
         court proceedings.


         3.5.2.2 Evidence


         The Task  Group  concurs  with  the  contention  that  the  general
         practice in South African courts to treat  the  evidence  given  by
         children with caution is outdated. The cautionary  rule  in  sexual
         offence cases rests mainly on the assumption that  complainants  in
         sexual offence cases, and particularly  female  complainants,  have
         an "innate" inclination  to  lie  in  matters  relating  to  sexual
         offences. This contention, which according to presenters has  found
         no empirical support in studies comparing the prevalence  of  false
         claims in  sexual  offence  cases  with  those  in  other  criminal
         offences, suggests that this approach  is  linked  to  the  age-old
         stereotyping of women.
         The Task Group is also concerned that  the  adversarial  nature  of
         leading evidence and  cross-examination  in  South  African  courts
         does not take into account the fact that disclosure  of  abuse  has
         been  shown  to  be  severely  traumatic  to  survivors,   or   the
         traumatised state in which the survivor may originally  have  first
         reported the sexual abuse.


         The  Task  Group  further  finds  that  the   introduction   of   a
         complainant's previous sexual history may seriously  prejudice  the
         finding of the court.  This  happened  in  a  recent  case  in  the
         Pretoria High Court that dealt with the abuse of a  five  year  old
         girl, where the defence suggested that she had  invited  the  abuse
         by  her  promiscuous  lifestyle,  and  the  Magistrate  took  these
         suggestions into consideration in sentencing. The Task Group is  of
         the opinion that calling into question the testimony of a  survivor
         of sexual abuse on the grounds of  their  previous  sexual  history
         may significantly contribute to  the  continued  stigmatisation  of
         survivors, and negatively impact on public perceptions  as  to  the
         seriousness with which the State treats allegations of abuse.


         3.5.2.3 Protection of survivors and witnesses


         Because of the emotional trauma attached to giving  evidence  in  a
         sexual offence matter, the Task Group finds  that  the  silence  of
         the law on the protection of particularly vulnerable  witnesses  is
         a serious omission. There is therefore no  legal  framework  within
         which to offer such witnesses the special protection they need.  It
         has further been reported that while a court will  generally  order
         that a rape survivor's testimony  be  heard  behind  closed  doors,
         there is in practice very  little  control  over  the  movement  of
         people in and out of court, even when a child  survivor  is  giving
         evidence. It was argued at the public hearings  that  persons  with
         disabilities have particular special needs that are  currently  not
         provided for.


         Notwithstanding the various provisions of  the  Criminal  Procedure
         Act (Act No 51 of 1977) it has become commonplace for the media  to
         report on sexual offences or alleged sexual offences, sometimes  by
         including names or identifying details of the survivor  and/or  the
         alleged offender and/or graphic details of the assault.


         It has been argued that the current legislation should be  adequate
         to protect witnesses. In practice, however,  details  of  survivors
         of sexual offences, and in  particular  children,  and  of  persons
         alleged to be the accused, but not yet formally identified as  such
         or charged, are regularly published despite the provisions  of  the
         law.  This  suggests  that  the  law  is  not   being   implemented
         effectively, and that the imposition of higher penalties  for  such
         offences may  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  provisions  are
         treated with the seriousness they merit.


         3.5.2.4 Bail


         The Task Group finds  the  manner  in  which  bail  legislation  is
         implemented unsatisfactory. Presenters have argued  that  the  ease
         with which bail is granted, and the divergent application  of  bail
         provisions in different courts, suggests that there  is  no  single
         national  understanding  of  the  seriousness  of  sexual  violence
         against children. A significant number of cases  were  cited  where
         offences are repeated after an accused has been granted bail.


         The Department of Justice indicated in their presentation that  the
         existing bail legislation (contained in section 60 of the  Criminal
         Procedure  Act)  is  adequate.  Section  60  provides  for  persons
         accused of offences listed in  Schedules  5  and  6  to  remain  in
         custody,  and  the  onus  is  on  the   accused   to   prove   that
         extraordinary circumstances exist why they should be granted  bail.
         The  Department  also  argued  that  bail  provisions   have   been
         tightened to deal, among others, with  repeat  offenders.  However,
         the Task Group notes the number of  instances  where  both  in  the
         media and during the public  hearings  the  granting  of  bail  was
         identified as one of the exacerbating factors in the fight  against
         child  rape  and  abuse.  Some   presentations   called   for   the
         establishment of the principle that no  person  accused  of  sexual
         abuse will be granted bail. The Task Group is of the  opinion  that
         this  issue  needs  further  investigation  by  the  relevant  SALC
         project committee.


         The protection of complainants from an  alleged  abuser  once  bail
         has been granted  is  another  matter  that  must  be  noted  here.
         Although  the  Domestic  Violence  Act  (no  116  of  1998)   makes
         provision for the removal of  the  abusive  person  from  the  home
         environment, in most cases the  abuser  is  returned  to  the  same
         environment as the abused child - be it at home, the school or  the
         broader community. Presenters have argued that  the  best  interest
         of the child extends to this level, and that protecting them  while
         the trial is under way, must form part of a  holistic  approach  to
         the issue of sexual violence against children.


         3.5.2.5 Sentencing


         There is currently the perception among members of the public  that
         sentences imposed for sexual offences are  too  lenient,  and  many
         calls were made at the public hearings for the imposition  of  life
         sentences for persons found guilty of  sexual  abuse  of  children.
         The Task Group finds that the inconsistency in meting out  sentence
         contributes  to  the  trauma  the  complainants   in   such   cases
         experience. It is of the opinion that  a  serious  effort  must  be
         made to ensure that the legislative  framework  for  sentencing  is
         adhered to by all members of the judiciary.


         Some presenters argued that rapists believe that they are  able  to
         cite the influence of alcohol or drugs as a mitigating factor  when
         they are apprehended and tried. The  Task  Group  heard  some  very
         strong recommendations regarding the control of alcohol as well  as
         the kind of jail sentences that would be appropriate for  offenders
         who claim  to  have  committed  sexual  violence  while  under  the
         influence of alcohol. The Task Group feels  strongly  that  alcohol
         and drug abuse  should  serve  as  an  aggravating  rather  than  a
         mitigating factor in sentencing.


         The Task Group notes a study  by  the  SALC,  which  suggests  that
         maximum sentences alone do not necessarily act as  a  deterrent  to
         serious crime, because since the introduction of mandatory  minimum
         sentences for offences including rape in  1997,  the  incidence  of
         rape with aggravating  circumstances  has  increased.  However,  in
         view of the marked increase in reporting of rape,  the  Task  Group
         is of the opinion that the above  conclusions  do  not  necessarily
         reflect accurately on the  correlation  between  heavier  sentences
         and the incidence of serious crime.


         This particular study by the SALC Project Committee  on  Sentencing
         also found that despite the minimum  sentences  introduced  by  the
         Criminal Law Act (Act No 105 of 1997),  and  despite  the  specific
         reference  in  the  legislation  to  the  seriousness   of   sexual
         offences, there is still considerable divergence in the  compliance
         with the Act. The Task Group acknowledges that the question of  the
         effectiveness of minimum sentences, and the consistency with  which
         the provisions of the Criminal Law Act  as  well  as  the  Criminal
         Procedure Act are applied insofar as sentencing  of  sex  offenders
         is concerned, is a complex matter, most  of  which  is  covered  in
         depth in the discussion paper by  the  SALC  Project  Committee  on
         Sentencing.


         3.5.2.6 Recommendations


         The Task Group recommends -in relation to effective prosecution  of
         cases


         *  that the Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
           establish clear guidelines for the handling of  cases  involving
           sexual offences, that  training  in  these  guidelines  be  made
           mandatory for all levels of personnel in the courts  system  and
           that the guidelines are communicated clearly to all complainants
           and witnesses before the commencement of a trial. It is  further
           recommended that the Department give the relevant  Parliamentary
           Committees  a  clear  commitment  about   timeframes   for   the
           completion and implementation of such guidelines.
         *  that the Department of Justice and  Constitutional  Development,
           in view of the  low  conviction  rates  in  relation  to  sexual
           offences, provide the  relevant  Parliamentary  Committees  with
           precise statistical information  in  this  regard  in  order  to
           explore strategies for improving conviction rates.
         *  that the National Directorate of  Public  Prosecutions  issue  a
           directive to the effect that when an action is  brought  against
           an alleged perpetrator of sexual abuse, the action should not be
           allowed to be withdrawn without the consent of the  Director  of
           Public Prosecutions.
         *  that the National Directorate of  Public  Prosecutions  issue  a
           directive instructing officials in the justice system to  report
           all knowledge of  corruption  concerning  the  withdrawal  of  a
           sexual offence case.
         *  that the Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
           brief the relevant Parliamentary Committees on the  progress  it
           is  making  with  regard  to  eliminating   inefficiencies   and
           corruption among justice officials, as well as the status of the
           Draft Anti-Corruption Bill.
         *  that officials in the court system give priority  to  processing
           cases related to sexual violence, and that they ensure that such
           cases are completed within the shortest possible time.
         *  that officials in the criminal prosecuting  system  have  access
           to  adequate  resources  and  advanced  technology   to   secure
           convictions.
         *  that  DNA  testing  remain  centralised  and  located  with  one
           specialised agency in order to ensure that national standards of
           testing are established and maintained.
         *  that the Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
           continues with the establishment  of  a  system  of  specialised
           sexual offences courts  on  the  model  of  the  Wynberg  Sexual
           Offences Court, and brief the relevant Parliamentary  Committees
           on the progress made with the national  implementation  of  this
           programme;


         in relation to evidence


         *  that the cautionary rule  with  regard  to  evidence  by  women,
           children and single  witnesses  in  cases  of  sexual  abuse  be
           abolished through a specific provision in  the  Sexual  Offences
           Act to this effect.
         *  that the previous sexual history of a complainant  in  a  sexual
           violence case not be admissible as evidence either in  the  pre-
           finding stage of a trial or in mitigation of sentencing;


         in relation to the protection of survivors of sexual violence


         *  that all personnel at courts dealing with sexual  offence  cases
           undergo mandatory training to  equip  them  with  the  necessary
           skills to deal with survivors of sexual violence, and that  this
           process of skills upgrading form part of a system of performance
           appraisal  to  ensure  that   the   State   employs   the   most
           appropriately skilled personnel in such courts.
         *  that cultural and language aspects  be  taken  into  account  by
           personnel involved in dealing with both survivors and  witnesses
           in cases of sexual abuse, and that the Department of Justice and
           Constitutional  Development  give  consideration  to   providing
           personnel with the relevant training in this regard.
         *  that provision be made  in  the  Sexual  Offences  Act  for  the
           category of vulnerable witnesses, that this category include all
           children involved in court proceedings, and that such  witnesses
           be able to claim special protection during the trial.  The  Task
           Group  also  recommends  that  the   needs   of   persons   with
           disabilities  be  given  special  attention  when  drafting  the
           provisions concerning "vulnerable witnesses".
         *   that  amendments  to  the  Criminal   Procedure   Act   include
           provisions that will not only make it illegal to make public the
           identity of survivors  in  sexual  violence  cases,  and/or  the
           identity  of  the  accused   before   they   have   been   found
           guilty/formally charged, but also makes explicit  provision  for
           publishers  contravening  this  legislation  to  be   criminally
           prosecuted and fined.


         in relation to bail


         *  that the National Directorate of  Public  Prosecutions  consider
           measures that will ensure that the granting of bail,  especially
           in relation to persons accused of committing sexual offences, is
           administered uniformly throughout the country.
         *  that the National Directorate of  Public  Prosecutions  consider
           measures that will ensure that  when  bail  conditions  for  sex
           offenders are determined, each decision give  attention  to  the
           principle contained in Section 7 of the Domestic  Violence  Act,
           which provides for the removal  of  the  abuser  from  the  home
           shared with the complainant when this is in the best interest of
           the abused child.
         *  that the Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
           brief the relevant Parliamentary  Committees  on  the  scope  of
           existing  bail  legislation  with  a  view  to  identifying  and
           amending possible weaknesses in the legislation.


         in relation to sentencing


         *   that  the  SALC  Project  Committee  on  Sentencing  brief  the
           relevant Parliamentary Committees with regard  to  the  progress
           they are making with the  proposed  Sentencing  Framework  Bill,
           that timeframes be established for the completion  of  the  Bill
           and that the manner in  which  the  current  perceptions  around
           inconsistent and inappropriate sentencing of sex  offenders  can
           be addressed, be explored.
         *  that serious attention be given at the level  of  the  judiciary
           to the manner in which provisions concerning minimum  sentencing
           are interpreted to ensure that sentences are  commensurate  with
           the  seriousness  of  a  crime  like  sexual  violence   against
           children.
         *  that the influence of alcohol and  drugs  be  considered  as  an
           aggravating factor in the sentencing of sex offenders.
         *  that the cost of anti-HIV/Aids prophylaxis  treatment  for  rape
           survivors be reclaimed from the perpetrator upon conviction.


         3.5.3   Correctional Services


         3.5.3.1 Introduction
         The Department of Correctional Services did not make  a  submission
         at the public hearings. In view of the  importance  of  the  debate
         around rehabilitation, and the wider debate in South Africa  around
         restorative  justice,  the  absence  of  Correctional  Services  is
         recognised as unfortunate.


         3.5.3.2 Child sex offenders


         Some presenters  made  reference  to  the  position  of  child  sex
         offenders in the correctional service system, and argued  that  the
         system  currently  does  not  cater  for   them   adequately.   The
         provisions of the Constitution makes it imperative that  Government
         use detention or imprisonment of children only  as  a  last  resort
         and  for  the  shortest  appropriate  period  of   time,   and   to
         accommodate  children  separately  from  adult   inmates   (Section
         28(1)(g) of the Constitution). Despite  a  programme  to  establish
         secure care facilities in all  of  the  provinces  to  ensure  that
         children in trouble with the law are accommodated in a manner  that
         takes into account their  developmental  needs,  the  reality  that
         hundreds of  children  are  still  accommodated  in  South  African
         prisons is a  cause  for  grave  concern.  Because  of  a  lack  of
         resources with which to completely develop the programme of  secure
         care, there seems to be  little  distinction  between  children  in
         custody and children in care, which results  in  children  in  both
         categories being accommodated in the same facilities.


         It was put to the Task Group that  there  are  currently  only  two
         programmes  that  deal  with  the  rehabilitation  of   child   sex
         offenders nationally. The Task Group finds  completely  inadequate,
         and supports the position that early intervention  in  relation  to
         child sex offenders  plays  an  important  role  in  enhancing  the
         offender's chances to be reintegrated into society. The Task  Group
         also finds that the large numbers  of  children  in  adult  prisons
         implies that they are  vulnerable  to  be  abused  themselves,  and
         their exposure  in  this  setting  to  sexual  violence  which  may
         reinforce the anti-social behaviour at the root  of  their  offence
         in the first place.


         The Task Group is of the opinion that the punishment of  the  child
         sex offender has to be appropriate to their developmental  capacity
         and age, and proportionate to the seriousness  of  the  crime.  The
         Task Group notes that the  proposed  Child  Justice  Bill  contains
         extensive proposals on the sentencing of child  offenders  and  the
         diversion of children out of the prison system. In  terms  of  this
         Bill, the purposes of sentencing children would  be  in  line  with
         the  concept  of  restorative  justice  -  encouraging  the  child,
         through a sentence proportionate to the  circumstances  surrounding
         the crime, to accept individual responsibility  for  their  actions
         and to facilitate the reintegration of that child into  the  family
         and community.
         3.5.3.3 Adult sex offenders


         The Task  Group  again  takes  cognisance  of  the  assertion  that
         conditions in South  African  prisons  are  not  conducive  to  the
         rehabilitation of sexual offenders, and that  the  high  levels  of
         violence, including sexual  violence,  may  in  fact  reduce  their
         chances of rehabilitation. It further notes the  comments  made  in
         various submissions with  regard  to  the  suitability  of  current
         rehabilitation programmes for  adult  sex  offenders.  Of  specific
         importance here is the argument that  courts  should  consider  the
         treatment and rehabilitation of all sexual  offenders  as  part  of
         the sentencing process to ensure that survivors and  the  community
         in  general  are  protected  against  repeat  offending  once   the
         offender has been released from prison.


         The Task Group takes  into  account  a  number  of  recommendations
         regarding the way Government  deals  with  sex  offenders.  One  of
         these recommendations contained in a detailed  submission  is  that
         rehabilitation  programmes  aimed  at   sex   offenders   must   be
         established in correctional facilities  as  a  matter  of  urgency.
         There has been a further  recommendation  that  all  sex  offenders
         should be required to undergo treatment in an accredited  treatment
         programme, preferably in a  community  setting,  when  released  on
         parole or  under  correctional  supervision.  The  submission  also
         gives attention to the procedures  to  be  followed  in  sentencing
         when considering the appropriateness of  rehabilitation  programmes
         for a particular offender. The Task Group notes the  recommendation
         that the offender should bear the cost of treatment  should  he  or
         she be in a position to do so, and that the State should  bear  the
         cost of treatment for offenders who cannot afford  to  pay  for  it
         themselves. At the same time, it acknowledges that severe  resource
         constraints  may  seriously  affect   the   feasibility   of   such
         proposals.
         The Task Group recognises that  where  a  "treatment  order"  forms
         part of a sentence, this would have to be  followed  up  to  ensure
         that a lack of resources or a lack of insight  into  the  need  for
         rehabilitation  are  not  the  reasons  why   such   rehabilitative
         treatment are not implemented. In addition, there would have to  be
         considerable campaigns  aimed  at  reaching  consensus  among  both
         correctional services staff and the public  in  general  that  such
         rehabilitation programmes do not constitute a mere waste  of  money
         on the offender at the cost of the taxpayer, but that  it  forms  a
         vital part of a completely new paradigm within which there will  be
         elements of both punitive and restorative justice.


         The Task Group further acknowledges that the comments above do  not
         elaborate on  all  the  different  aspects  of  the  debate  around
         rehabilitation, and that the issue of effective  rehabilitation  of
         sex offenders, the cost of such programmes and  the  conditions  in
         correctional facilities merit further  investigation  by  both  the
         Departments of Correctional Services and Social Development.


         3.5.3.4 Register of Sex Offenders


         In media reports as well as in discussions before the  Task  Group,
         the establishment of a national register of sex offenders has  been
         suggested as one of the preventative measures that  could  be  used
         to combat the sexual abuse of children. It  has  been  argued  that
         there are a number  of  examples  of  how  such  a  register  could
         operate, and the example of the United Kingdom was put as the  kind
         of system that could most benefit the South African context.


         In the UK, the Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires those  convicted  of
         specified sexual offences involving children, and of other  serious
         sexual  offences  against  adults,  to  register  their  names  and
         addresses with the police. At present  the  registration  rules  in
         the UK include the following: sex  offenders  must  register  their
         name and address with a designated police station within  72  hours
         of their release from jail. Failure to register can lead to a  six-
         month jail term or fine. In addition, the police can  apply  for  a
         community protection order, which  lasts  for  a  minimum  of  five
         years,  and  can  bar  an  individual  from  areas  frequented   by
         children.  Head  teachers,  doctors,  youth  leaders,   sports-club
         managers and others are notified on a  confidential  basis  of  the
         presence of a local sex offender.


         At the core of the argument in favour of such  a  register  is  the
         belief that informing the child  protection  agencies  and  certain
         other professionals who work with children of the whereabouts of  a
         convicted sex offender will enable these agencies  and  individuals
         to keep sex offenders away from children. The Task Group notes  the
         contention that rehabilitation of  sex  offenders  in  the  current
         prison environment has had little success, and that  a  significant
         number of sex offenders become  repeat  offenders  once  they  have
         been released from prison.


         While  noting  the  arguments  in  favour  of  a  register  of  sex
         offenders,  the  Task  Group  has  also  considered  the  arguments
         against it. It has been shown, for example, that  there  is  little
         to stop a sex offender giving a false address when  complying  with
         their  mandatory  registration  requirements.   Another   important
         factor that has to be noted is the  question  of  what  the  public
         does with the information in a register, should the general  public
         have access to it, as is the case in  some  states  in  the  United
         States of America. Even where access to the register is limited  to
         certain categories of people, there have  been  numerous  cases  of
         misidentification, vigilante attacks on  sex  offenders,  and  even
         suicides of people who have been subjected to public  attack  after
         their names were included in a public register  of  sex  offenders.
         The Task Group notes that placing information concerning  offenders
         on  the  Internet  must  be  approached  very  carefully,  as  such
         information is accessible not only to  the  community  that  it  is
         aimed at protecting,  but  nationally  and  internationally,  which
         opens it to abuse.


         A third argument is that such a register may drive  the  activities
         of sex offenders even more underground, which could make  the  work
         of protection agencies all the more difficult.


         The  Task  Group  recognises  proposals  that  a  register  of  sex
         offenders could be useful as a means of  keeping  serial  offenders
         out of children's services. Such a register should be available  to
         assist with the screening of prospective staff members,  volunteers
         or substitute caregivers for children  within  schools,  designated
         child care services and  major  youth  organisations,  and  for  no
         other purpose  whatever.  In  addition,  the  proposals  hold  that
         strict controls on access to this information and strong  sanctions
         for any breach of the limitations should be put in place, and  that
         severe criminal penalties should apply to malicious reporting.


         It must be noted that the efficacy of such a register has not  been
         established, nor has the cost implications for South Africa.


         3.5.3.5 Recommendations


         The Task Group recommends -


         in relation to child sex offenders


         *  that the Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
           brief the relevant Parliamentary Committees on the measures  the
           Department intends to take with a view to fulfil South  Africa's
           obligations under Section  28(1)(g)  of  the  Constitution  with
           regard to sentencing of child offenders.
         *  that the Department of Correctional Services brief the  relevant
           Parliamentary Committees on the measures the Department  intends
           to take with a view  to  fulfil  South  Africa's  constitutional
           under Section 28 of the  obligations  with  regard  to  detained
           children.
         *  that the Department of Correctional Services brief the  relevant
           Parliamentary   Committees   on   its   programmes    for    the
           rehabilitation of child sex offenders, as well as the facilities
           available for the removal of children out of adult prisons.
         *  that the draft Child  Justice  Bill  be  finalised  as  soon  as
           possible, and that the Department of Constitutional  Development
           brief the relevant Parliamentary Committees on the  contents  of
           the Bill, as well as the reasons for  the  delay  in  processing
           this legislation.
         *  that this proposed legislation also include  explicit  reference
           to  the  mandatory  responsibilities  of  different   government
           agencies to ensure that programmes of restorative justice can be
           successfully implemented;


         in relation to adult sex offenders


         *  that the Department of Correctional Services brief the  relevant
           Parliamentary   Committees   on   its   programmes    for    the
           rehabilitation  of   adult   sex   offenders,   including   cost
           implications   of   existing   and   envisaged    rehabilitation
           programmes.
         *   that  the  recommendations  with  regard   to   the   mandatory
           rehabilitative treatment of sex offenders, where upon assessment
           found appropriate, be considered for inclusion in  the  proposed
           Sentencing Framework Bill, and that members of the judiciary  as
           well as correctional services personnel be trained  with  regard
           to the importance of rehabilitative treatment.
         *   that  proposed  changes  to  legislation  to  allow  for   more
           effective  rehabilitation  of  sex  offenders  include  explicit
           reference  to  the  mandatory  responsibilities   of   different
           government agencies to ensure that rehabilitation programmes can
           be successfully implemented;


         in relation to a register of sex offenders


         *  that the  establishment  of  a  register  of  sex  offenders  be
           investigated by  a  task  team  comprising  the  Departments  of
           Correctional Services, Safety and Security,  Social  Development
           and Justice and Constitutional Development, and that  this  task
           team report to the relevant Parliamentary Committees.
         *  that the effectiveness of  such  registers  in  countries  where
           they exist be investigated by the above-mentioned task team.
         *  that should a register of sex  offenders  be  established,  this
           register  not  be  open  to  the  public,  but  managed  by  the
           Departments of Correctional  Services,  Social  Development  and
           Safety and Security for the purposes of  keeping  sex  offenders
           out  of  schools,  designated  child  care  services  and  youth
           organisations.  It  further  recommends  that  such  a  register
           include an updated history of the offender's offences as well as
           his or her participation in rehabilitative programmes.
         *  that this task team investigate the question of including  in  a
           register of sex offenders  the  names  and  details  of  persons
           against whom allegations of abuse have been made, but  who  have
           not been found guilty by a court.


         3.6     International instruments for the protection of children
         3.6.1   Introduction


         The Task Group finds that sexual abuse  of  children  can  have  an
         international dimension or cross border implications. That  is  why
         international cooperation and a common legal standard of  norms  in
         relation to these issues are needed in order  to  properly  address
         the problems involved. The Task Group therefore takes note  of  the
         international legal  framework  with  regard  to  sexual  abuse  of
         children within which State  authorities  and  private  individuals
         act.


         One of the areas of sexual abuse of  children  that  could  have  a
         direct international dimension is the  area  of  commercial  sexual
         exploitation and trafficking in  persons.  Unfortunately  the  Task
         Group was offered no empirical data in relation to the problem.  It
         could therefore not be assessed  during  the  Public  Hearings  how
         widespread these problems are. The Task Group, however, notes  that
         the impact of commercial sexual exploitation on the well  being  of
         affected and vulnerable children is devastating  and  needs  to  be
         properly addressed by cooperation of all  State  authorities  on  a
         national and on an international level.


         3.6.2   International Law Framework


         3.6.2.1 International treaties binding on South Africa


         South Africa is bound by the 1990 African  Charter  on  the  Rights
         and Welfare of the Child which provides in Article 16 that


         1. States Parties  to  the  present  Charter  shall  take  specific
         legislative, administrative, social  and  educational  measures  to
         protect the child from all forms of torture, inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment and  especially  physical  or  mental  injury  or  abuse,
         neglect or maltreatment including sexual abuse, while in  the  care
         of a parent, legal  guardian  or  school  authority  or  any  other
         person who has the care of the child.


         2. Protective measures under this Article shall  include  effective
         procedures for the establishment of  special  monitoring  units  to
         provide necessary support for the child and for those who have  the
         care of the child, as well as other forms  of  prevention  and  for
         identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment,  and
         follow-up of instances of child abuse and neglect.


         South Africa is furthermore party to the 1989 UN Convention on  the
         Rights of the Child which contains in  Article  19  the  obligation
         that


         1.  States  Parties  shall  take   all   appropriate   legislative,
         administrative, social and  educational  measures  to  protect  the
         child from all forms of physical  or  mental  violence,  injury  or
         abuse,   neglect   or   negligent   treatment,   maltreatment    or
         exploitation,  including  sexual  abuse,  while  in  the  care   of
         parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has  the  care
         of the child.


         2.  Such  protective  measures  should,  as  appropriate,   include
         effective procedures for the establishment of social programmes  to
         provide necessary support for the child and for those who have  the
         care of the child, as well as for other  forms  of  prevention  and
         for identification, reporting, referral,  investigation,  treatment
         and  follow-up  of  instances  of  child   maltreatment   described
         heretofore, and, as appropriate, for judicial involvement.


         South Africa is moreover bound by the  1999  Convention  concerning
         the Prohibition and Immediate Action for  the  Elimination  of  the
         Worst Forms of Child Labour (ILO No. 182), to [...] take  immediate
         and effective measures to secure the  prohibition  and  elimination
         of the worst forms of child labour as a matter of urgency.


         In the context of this provision the term  "worst  forms  of  child
         labour" comprises [...] the use, procuring or offering of  a  child
         for  prostitution,  for  the  production  of  pornography  or   for
         pornographic performances [...]


         and


         [...] work which, by its nature or the circumstances  in  which  it
         is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or  morals  of
         children.


         It must be noted therefore  that  South  Africa  already  committed
         itself on an international level to  put  into  place  these  above
         mentioned protective measures for children.


         3.6.2.2 Instruments not signed or  ratified  by  South  Africa  and
                    therefore not binding on the Republic


         It must, however, be further noted that other instruments exist  on
         the level of international law that  deal  more  specifically  with
         the topic of commercial  sexual  exploitation  and  trafficking  in
         children than the above-mentioned Conventions. In this context  two
         international legal instruments must be taken into account.


         The 2000 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights  of  the
         Child on  the  Sale  of  Children,  Child  Prostitution  and  Child
         Pornography entered into force  on  18  January  2002  without  the
         signature or the ratification of South Africa.  This  Protocol  was
         drafted by the United Nations because there was a  general  concern
         that the Convention on the Rights of the  Child  does  not  provide
         for safeguards effective  enough  to  address  and  deal  with  the
         problem  of  sale  of  children,  child  prostitution   and   child
         pornography. It therefore  aims  at  extending  the  measures  that
         States Parties of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  should
         undertake with regard to the problem. Concrete measures  proscribed
         by  the  Protocol  include   the   unconditional   extradition   of
         perpetrators of sexual  abuse  of  children  (article  5)  and  the
         deepening of international  collaboration  and  assistance  in  the
         fight against the mentioned  crimes  and  its  criminal  punishment
         (article 6). Furthermore, the Protocol places concrete  obligations
         on States Parties to protect the child survivors of such crimes  in
         the course of the establishment  of  criminal  proceedings  against
         perpetrators (article 8), an  issue  that  was  raised  by  various
         presenters during the public hearings, who expressed major  concern
         in relation to possible secondary abuse of the child survivor.
         The Task Group further takes note of  the  existence  of  the  2000
         Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish  Trafficking  in  Persons,
         Especially Women and Children,  Supplementing  the  United  Nations
         Convention Against Transnational Organized  Crime.  The  Convention
         Against Transnational Organized Crime was signed by  South  Africa,
         but has not yet been ratified. Trafficking is defined in article  3
         of the Optional Protocol as including


         [...] the  recruitment,  transportation,  transfer,  harbouring  or
         receipt of persons, by means of the  threat  or  use  of  force  or
         other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of  deception,  of
         the abuse of power or of the position of vulnerability  or  of  the
         giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the  consent
         of a person having control over another person, for the purpose  of
         exploition.
         In the context of the Protocol, exploitation comprises


         [...] the exploitation of  the  prostitution  of  others  or  other
         forms of sexual exploitation [...].


         The Protocol  aims  specifically  at  criminalising  all  forms  of
         trafficking in children  (see  article  5)  and  at  assisting  and
         protecting survivors of trafficking (see article 6).  In  doing  so
         the  Protocol  has  the  potential  to  extend  the  protection  of
         sexually  abused  children  beyond  what  is  already  granted  and
         provided for by other  international  treaties  such  as  the  more
         general African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child  and
         the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.


         The coming into force of these  two  above-mentioned  international
         law instruments  for  South  Africa  would  therefore  add  to  the
         protection of  children  from  all  kinds  of  sexual  abuse,  both
         nationally and internationally.


         With  regard  to  the  specific  problem   of   commercial   sexual
         exploitation of children through the use  of  modern  communication
         technology, it must be noted  that  South  Africa  has  signed  the
         Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  This  Convention  aims
         at closing existing loopholes in legislation  that  emerge  through
         the  rapid  advancement  and  development  of  modern   technology.
         Article  9  of  the  Convention  would  place  the  country   under
         obligation to act against child pornography on the  Internet.  This
         Convention could therefore be an answer to  questions  in  relation
         to crimes committed using the Internet as  highlighted  earlier  in
         this Report. South Africa,  however,  has  not  yet  ratified  this
         Convention.


         3.6.3   Recommendations


         The Task Group recommends


         *  that further investigation  into  international  trafficking  in
           children,  child  prostitution,   and   child   pornography   be
           commissioned by the relevant Statutory bodies in order to obtain
           a clear picture of the  extent  of  the  problem;  these  bodies
           should brief the  relevant  Parliamentary  Committees  on  their
           findings
         *  and, taking note of the Resolution adopted by the  106th  Inter-
           Parliamentary Conference  in  Ouagadougou  on  14/09/2001,  that
           South  Africa  immediately  sign  and   ratify   the   following
           international  instruments  in  order   to   provide   for   the
           comprehensive protection of children from all  forms  of  sexual
           abuse, to simplify international collaboration in preventing and
           punishing  these  crimes,  and  to  facilitate  the  closing  of
           possible loopholes in the existing legislation:
         o Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights  of  the  Child
         on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and  Child  Pornography
         (U.N. General Assembly resolution A/RES/54/263 of 25 May 2000);
         o U.N. Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (G.A.  res.
         55/25, annex I, 55 U.N. GAOR  Supp.  (No.  49)  at  44,  U.N.  Doc.
         A/45/49 (Vol. I) (2001)),
         o Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in  Persons,
         Especially Women and Children,  Supplementing  the  United  Nations
         Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (G.A. res.  55/25,
         annex II, 55 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 49)  at  60,  U.N.  Doc.  A/45/49
         (Vol. I) (2001)).
         o Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (ETS No. 185).


         3.7     Commercial sexual exploitation


         3.7.1   Introduction


         Several presenters raised the question of  sexual  exploitation  of
         children in a commercial context,  for  example  child  pornography
         and child prostitution. Furthermore, the problem  of  international
         trafficking in  children  for  the  purpose  of  commercial  sexual
         exploitation was raised. The Task Group takes note  of  contentions
         that South African children are increasingly being trafficked  into
         slavery or prostitution.


         However, the Task Group found that the research  presented  at  the
         hearings did not necessarily reflect the situation in South  Africa
         with regard to the trafficking of children accurately, and that  it
         could not assess the extent of commercial  sexual  exploitation  in
         South Africa. The Task Group, however, notes  that  the  impact  of
         commercial sexual exploitation on the well being  of  affected  and
         vulnerable  children  is  devastating  and  needs  to  be  properly
         addressed by cooperation of all State  authorities  on  a  national
         and international level. One must not forget that a child does  not
         prostitute her or himself out  of  free  choice  but  is  always  a
         victim of criminal activities of other people.


         The problem of child pornography and the  State  responses  to  the
         production,  proliferation,  and  consumption  thereof,   will   be
         discussed in the context of issues related to the mass  media.  The
         Task Group notes that it is  a  serious  criminal  offence  to  use
         children  for  the  production  of  pornography,   and   that   the
         distribution and consumption of this kind of pornography should  be
         punished severely.


         With regard to  the  specific  distribution  of  child  pornography
         through electronic media, the Task Group is  of  the  opinion  that
         there are shortcomings in the  national  legislation  currently  in
         existence. The Film and Publications Act (Act No 65 of 1996),  does
         not properly address the  risks  imposed  by  modern  technological
         developments and needs  to  be  updated.  Section  27  of  the  Act
         creates the offence of knowingly creating, producing, importing  or
         being in possession of  a  publication  or  film  that  contains  a
         visual presentation of child pornography.  The  definition  of  the
         term  "film"  seems  to  be  broad  enough  to   encompass   visual
         presentations and images relayed on the  Internet.  However,  given
         its special focus and the nature of the classification  system,  it
         is clear that the Act does not, and cannot,  specifically  regulate
         Internet  material,   including   advertisements,   accessible   to
         children.


         3.7.2   Recommendations


         The Task Group therefore recommends


         *   that  the  Department  of  Safety  and  Security  ensure   that
           amendments to the Sexual Offences Act  that  include  provisions
           criminalising commercial sexual  exploitation  be  finalised  as
           soon as possible.
         *  that a new children's statute include a general  provision  that
           criminalises the trafficking in children.
         *  that if a court finds that  a  child  has  been  trafficked  for
           purposes of commercial sexual exploitation by his or her parents
           or any other person  legally  responsible  for  the  child,  all
           parental rights of that person be suspended  and  the  child  be
           placed immediately into alternative care.
         *  that parents who are guilty of trafficking  their  children,  be
           criminally charged with neglect  and  abuse  of  their  parental
           responsibilities
         *  that the  offence  of  child  trafficking  be  included  in  the
           Sentencing Framework Bill as a very serious offence.
         *  that a child prostitute not be treated  as  a  criminal,  but  a
           child in need of care and protection.
         *  that the Department of Home Affairs,  in  partnership  with  the
           Department of Safety and Security, further ensure that  possible
           loopholes  in  the  current  legislation  with  regard  to   the
           distribution of  child  pornography  and  the  sexual  abuse  of
           children using modern technology are closed.
         *  that an obligation be placed on Internet service  providers  not
           to allow child pornography  on  their  servers  and,  when  they
           become aware of a case of child pornography or sexual  abuse  of
           children by use of the Internet, to inform the relevant judicial
           authorities. Internet service providers must monitor their sites
           and  be  liable  if  they  knowingly  provide  access  to  child
           pornography.
         *  that effective rehabilitation programmes be put  into  place  to
           educate, encourage and support children to leave a situation  of
           commercial  sexual  exploitation,  and   that   the   provincial
           departments  responsible  for  Social  Development  ensure  that
           investigations aimed at determining the extent  of  the  problem
           are carried out, and allocate resources for such programmes.
         *  that education programmes be rolled out that sensitise  children
           and  the  community  to  the  problem   of   commercial   sexual
           exploitation of children. Such programmes must aim at  detecting
           and identifying risk factors or situations  that  make  children
           vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation. In such programmes
           children must be encouraged to seek help and assistance if  they
           are survivors of sexual exploitation.
         *  that Government support and encourage initiatives to  raise  the
           public  profile  of  organisations  that  render   services   to
           survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation.
         *  that  the  challenges  highlighted  by  the  Report  inform  any
           further debates on  the  decriminalisation  of  prostitution  in
           South Africa.
         3.8     Media


         3.8.1   Introduction


         The role of the media in promoting sexual  violence  against  women
         and children was raised  in  different  submissions;  at  the  same
         time, some presenters believed that the media has a  positive  role
         to play in campaigns aimed at combating these  forms  of  violence.
         It was argued before the Task Group that the media is  contributing
         to the image of women and children  as  commodities  and  that  the
         unequal power  relations  between  men  and  women  exacerbate  the
         situation. This adds to the perception that men have the  right  to
         claim sexual subservience from women and children.


         The Task Group notes the concern expressed  about  the  content  of
         programming on the national television channels, especially  as  it
         relates to violence or sexually explicit material.  It  also  notes
         the submission  that  the  South  African  Broadcasting  Complaints
         Commission  is  not  sufficiently   effective   in   dealing   with
         complaints from the  public,  and  that  its  Code  of  Conduct  is
         regularly breached. However, the Task Group  did  not  receive  any
         submission that details such instances.


         The Task Group notes at this juncture that it is important  to  use
         the media as an effective tool for raising public awareness  around
         sexual  violence.  It  further  notes  that   the   media   has   a
         responsibility to report  regularly  and  consistently  on  matters
         surrounding  sexual  violence   against   children,   rather   than
         predominantly covering sensational cases.  Recommendations  on  the
         role of the media in changing attitudes about gender  roles,  power
         relations and sexuality are contained elsewhere in this Report.


         A substantial portion  of  the  submissions  that  focused  on  the
         media, however, dealt with the  question  of  pornography  and  its
         possible link to sexual violence against women  and  children.  The
         question was raised whether pornography and  other  media  exposure
         cause rape,  and  different  arguments  were  put  forward  at  the
         hearings.


         The South African Government  made  a  clear  decision  around  the
         legality of adult pornography with the introduction  of  the  Films
         and Publications Act in 1996. While  it  wanted  to  make  a  clear
         break with the censorship laws of the past, it  sought  to  ensure,
         among others, that the  right  to  freedom  of  expression,  as  it
         pertains to the  right  to  be  in  possession  of  adult  material
         depicting adults in non-violent sexual acts, is protected.  At  the
         same time, the legislation sought to  prohibit  the  possession  or
         distribution of child pornography,  material  that  depicts  sexual
         violence  and  material  that  depicts  bestiality   or   excessive
         violence.
         The Task Group recognises of the opinion  that  Government  policy,
         the Films and Publications Board, and  the  judicial  system  armed
         with the Films and Publications Act in turn,  has  had  to  balance
         the  individual   freedom   of   expression   guaranteed   in   the
         Constitution (Section 16)  with  the  need  to  protect  vulnerable
         sections of society against abuses of that  freedom.  This  tension
         provides  some  of  the  context  within   which   discussions   of
         pornography have taken place, and continues to  inform  the  debate
         about pornography in South Africa.


         Although it considers this a serious and ongoing debate,  the  Task
         Group also notes  the  concern  expressed  that  our  laws  do  not
         sufficiently  protect  children  against  adult  pornography.  With
         regard to child pornography, the Task Group  emphatically  supports
         Government's  position:  child  pornography  is  not  a  matter  of
         freedom of expression, nor is it a genre of erotica. It is  both  a
         form of sexual exploitation of children  and  a  representation  of
         that exploitation. The Task Group agrees  with  the  position  that
         child pornography is often used  to  abuse  more  children,  noting
         various  studies  that  suggest  a  direct   link   between   child
         pornography and abuse.


         The  Task  Group  believes  that  any  child   pornographic   image
         constitutes  child  abuse.  The  image  degrades  and   dehumanises
         children, whether it involves real children in  its  production  or
         whether it is simulated. It  also  notes  suggestions  that  having
         been abused through child pornography leaves an indelible  mark  on
         the child, and could result in severe behavioural consequences  for
         the child in later life. Therefore the  Task  Group  believes  that
         there can be no  tolerance  for  the  production,  distribution  or
         possession of child pornography.


         The distribution of child pornography continues to abuse the  child
         long after the perpetrator may have been apprehended.  In  view  of
         the  operation  of  the  Internet  as  a  worldwide  and  virtually
         immediate distribution tool, and  the  overwhelming  evidence  that
         pornographic  sites  on  the  Internet  are  increasingly  easy  to
         access, the Task Group expresses great concern  that  South  Africa
         still has no legislation in place to deal with the distribution  of
         child  pornography  on  the  Internet.  It  notes   the   proposals
         contained in the draft Films and Publications Amendment  Bill,  but
         finds no satisfactory answer to why this Bill has  still  not  been
         tabled in Parliament for consideration and adoption.


         South Africa is bound by the UN Convention on  the  Rights  of  the
         Child  (Article 34) of which places it under further obligation  to
         put in place  legislation  that  will  expressly  protect  children
         against  child  pornography  -  a   form   of   commercial   sexual
         exploitation of children. The African Charter  on  the  Rights  and
         Welfare of the Child also makes very clear reference  (Article  27)
         to  the  obligation  on  States  parties  to  protect  children  by
         preventing  the  use  of  children  in   pornographic   activities,
         performances and materials. The link between child pornography  and
         commercial sexual exploitation of children is  further  established
         in the International Labour Organization's Convention 182 to  which
         South Africa is party.


         These international instruments, already binding upon  our  country
         have been discussed more fully elsewhere in this Report.


         3.8.2   Protecting survivors from media exposure


         The question of the role of the media in identifying  sexual  abuse
         survivors and their families is discussed elsewhere in  the  report
         within the context of the criminal  justice  system,  and  findings
         and recommendations with regard  to  appropriate  conduct  for  the
         media are elaborated there.
         However, the  Task  Group  was  particularly  concerned  about  the
         submission made by the producer of a  BBC-commissioned  documentary
         film about child rape in  South  Africa.  Members  expressed  their
         deep concern about the protection of the identity of  survivors  or
         their families in such films. There was also concern about  whether
         participants  in  documentary  films  of  this  nature  are   being
         encouraged to  participate  by  way  of  financial  incentive,  and
         whether  they  are  afforded  the  opportunity  to  make   informed
         decisions about the implications of their participation in  such  a
         film.


         3.8.3   Recommendations


         The Task Group recommends


         *   that  the  draft  Films  and  Publications  Amendment  Bill  be
           finalised and tabled in Parliament urgently.
         *  that the Departments of Safety and  Security  and  Home  Affairs
           brief the relevant Parliamentary Committees on the establishment
           of specialised police units for the combating  of  cyber  crime,
           including child pornography on the Internet.
         *  that the Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
           brief the relevant Parliamentary Committees  on  its  programmes
           with regard to training officials and staff in the judiciary  on
           the role of new technologies in sexual crimes against children.
         *   that  the  debate  about  protecting  children  against   adult
           pornography be taken up at a national level.
         *  that a "24/7" Network be established in terms of Article  27  of
           the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  to   facilitate   international
           cooperation between South Africa and its co-signatories  to  the
           Convention. The Article provides that each Party shall designate
           a point of contact available on a twenty-four hour, seven-day-a-
           week basis, in  order  to  ensure  the  provision  of  immediate
           assistance for the  purpose  of  investigations  or  proceedings
           concerning criminal offences related  to  computer  systems  and
           data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of  a
           criminal offence.
         *  that sustained public awareness campaigns be put into  operation
           to inform all Internet users, but  especially  parents,  of  the
           dangers of children accessing pornography on the  Internet,  and
           on  ways  to  block  child  pornography  from   their   personal
           computers.
         *   that  the  Department   of   Home   Affairs   investigate   the
           establishment of "Hotlines" that would  enable  members  of  the
           public to inform the police about possible illegal  material  on
           the Internet with a view to  removing  this  material  from  the
           servers in question.
         *  that filmmakers take cognisance  of  the  right  to  dignity  as
           contained  in  Section  10  of  the  Constitution  when   making
           documentary films about  sensitive  issues  such  as  abuse,  by
           ensuring that the identity of survivors and  their  families  is
           protected. This is especially true as it  pertains  to  children
           who are unable to make decisions  for  themselves  and  who  may
           suffer secondary abuse as a result of such films.
         *  that the Departments of Home Affairs  and  Safety  and  Security
           investigate the adequacy of the  enforcement  of  the  Film  and
           Publications Act as it relates to minors accessing  pornographic
           material, with a view to proposing measures to deal with closing
           the loopholes.
         *   that  the  Departments  of  Communications  and  Home   Affairs
           investigate the effectiveness of  strategies  to  monitor  media
           broadcasting as done by the Film and Publications Board, with  a
           view to reporting to the relevant Parliamentary Committees.
         *   that  the  Departments  of  Communications  and  Home   Affairs
           investigate the effectiveness of the manner in which  the  South
           African  Broadcasting   Complaints   Commission   enforces   its
           Broadcasting Code of Conduct and deals with  public  complaints,
           with  a  view  to  reporting  to  the   relevant   Parliamentary
           Committees.


         4  Conclusions


         4.1     Overall Findings


         Children are our most valuable  resource  for  the  future  of  our
         country and we need to ensure that they are given  the  best  care,
         attention, protection and love in order to ensure that  the  future
         of the country is in the hands of responsible  and  caring  adults.
         This message of how precious and vulnerable our  children  are  was
         brought home to the Task Group when it heard direct  evidence  from
         abused children. The Task Group was very moved and touched  by  the
         openness and strength of these children  who  had  the  courage  to
         share their feelings at the hearings.  The  Task  Group  wishes  to
         express its deepest gratitude to these children.


         The Task Group  is  of  the  opinion  that  any  efforts  aimed  at
         addressing the levels of violence in  South  African  society  must
         take cognisance of the conditions  under  which  large  numbers  of
         people  in  South  Africa  live.  The  social  disintegration  that
         results from the legacy of Apartheid  contributes  to  a  situation
         where violence becomes a means of exerting and asserting  power.  A
         situation  of  poverty  very  often  renders  not  only  the  child
         survivor powerless, but also those persons  who  must  protect  the
         child.


         The vision that South Africa has for  its  children  is  that  they
         will live in a  society  in  which  they  can  achieve  their  full
         potential by growing up in a secure, stable and loving  environment
         where  they   have   the   opportunity   to   develop   physically,
         intellectually, emotionally, socially and spiritually.  The  rights
         enshrined in the South African Constitution,  and  as  set  out  in
         international instruments  such  as  the  African  Charter  on  the
         Rights and Welfare of the  Child  and  the  UN  Convention  on  the
         Rights of the Child must form the basis on  which  this  vision  is
         transformed into a reality. In terms  of  these  instruments,  both
         national and international, each child has the  right  to  parental
         or family care, to grow up within the context of  that  family  and
         his or her community, and to  be  protected  against  maltreatment,
         abuse, neglect and degradation.


         South Africa has in many  respects  made  significant  advances  in
         establishing the beginning of a rights-based  culture  through  the
         passing  of  crucial  legislation  that   addresses   the   State's
         responsibility to give effect to  the  Constitutional  rights.  The
         establishment of  a  jurisprudence  that  speaks  directly  to  the
         manner in which individuals are able to demand certain rights  from
         the State, has been seen as a very important achievement  for  such
         a young democracy. However, the social  reality  that  millions  of
         South Africans face daily, and the reality that  children  are  the
         most  vulnerable  under  circumstances   of   social   deprivation,
         severely impedes the realisation of those rights.


         Government  must  therefore  concentrate  its  efforts  to  enhance
         people's developmental capacity by creating  an  environment  where
         individuals are able to work, to participate in community life  and
         to protect the families  they  form  part  of.  Despite  very  real
         progress  made  in  relation   to   improving   people's   material
         conditions  and  thereby  strengthening  children's   developmental
         opportunities, every year thousands of  children  still  experience
         emotional, physical and sexual abuse.
         The Task Group has heard the concern, comments and  recommendations
         of a broad number of individuals, organisations of  civil  society,
         as well as certain government departments. It  has  considered  all
         the submissions presented to it, and makes the  following  findings
         and recommendations by way of conclusion:


         *  Sexual abuse of children knows no boundaries  of  social  class,
           race or gender.
         *  Conditions of abject  poverty  and  social  disintegration  make
           children especially vulnerable to sexual abuse.
         *  There are serious challenges  in  the  way  Government  supports
           services and programmes aimed  at  preventing  sexual  abuse  of
           children or protecting them from secondary  abuse.  The  biggest
           weakness relates to the absence of  an  integrated  approach  to
           sexual abuse: there is no single understanding of the nature  of
           sexual abuse, its effect on  children  or  the  needs  of  child
           survivors.  As  a  result,   government   departments   do   not
           collaborate effectively and efficiently.  While  this  situation
           often causes secondary abuse, it is also an inappropriate manner
           for South Africa to spend its resources.
         *  Legislation aimed at protecting children  and  empowering  those
           charged with protecting children needs urgent improvement.
         *  Certain policies developed in  partnership  with  civil  society
           are not being effectively implemented.
         *  Law enforcement agencies are not  always  appropriately  trained
           to deal with child survivors of sexual abuse, and where  trained
           staff work in specialised units, they are under-resourced.
         *  Certain levels of the criminal justice system do  not  take  the
           needs of the survivor into account, which results  in  secondary
           abuse.
         *  The child and family welfare  services  provided  by  Government
           are under-resourced, which leads to serous  limitations  in  the
           scope of services provided and the ability of  professionals  in
           government  services  to  cope  adequately  with  the   workload
           expected of  them.  This  also  leads  to  an  over-emphasis  on
           curative interventions in respect  of  vulnerable  families  and
           children at risk of abuse, and few resources being available for
           preventing abuse.
         *  The child and family welfare services provided by civil  society
           organisations are also seriously under-resourced, which makes it
           extremely  difficult  for  service  organisations   to   attract
           appropriately trained professionals to these organisations,  and
           for organisations to focus on preventative programmes.
         *  In view of the fact that significant numbers  of  civil  society
           organisations are not effectively rooted in the communities they
           are  meant  to  serve,  the  limited  resources  available   for
           preventative services to children and families are not  are  not
           being applied appropriately.
         *  There is a need for increased  public  awareness  of  children's
           rights as well as  the  responsibility  of  each  individual  to
           promote and protect those  rights,  for  example,  by  reporting
           sexual abuse of children.


         4.2     Overall Recommendations


         The Task Group recommends -


         *  that the question of sexual abuse of children be  approached  in
           an integrated, comprehensive and holistic manner to ensure  that
           preventative programmes can make an impact on the  incidence  of
           sexual abuse in  South  Africa.  This  should  ensure  that  the
           protection and care offered to  survivors  of  sexual  abuse  is
           responsive to the full impact of the abuse on the survivor.
         *   that  all  programmes  aimed  at  preventing  abuse  take   due
           cognisance  of  the  material  conditions  that  impact  on  the
           prevalence of sexual abuse, and that such programmes are  linked
           to integrated development strategies already in place.
         *  that the responsibilities  that  different  government  agencies
           have with regard to both prevention  of  sexual  abuse  and  the
           protection and treatment of survivors of abuse be spelt  out  in
           legislation, where appropriate.
         *  that  Government  strengthen  partnerships  with  civil  society
           organisations involved in prevention of  sexual  abuse  and  the
           protection and treatment of  survivors  of  abuse  in  order  to
           ensure that there is a common understanding of the  approach  to
           the protection of children in South Africa.
         *    that   Government   commit   adequate   resources   for    the
           implementation of legislation and  policy  aimed  at  preventing
           abuse and protecting children, and  that  the  crucial  role  of
           civil society organisations in the areas of both prevention  and
           protection be recognised and supported.
         *  that sustained awareness campaigns be used to  make  the  public
           aware of available services aimed at the prevention of abuse and
           the protection of children through.
         *  that the relevant government departments ensure  that  awareness
           campaigns are aimed at enabling individuals and  communities  to
           assist in preventing  abuse  through  early  warning  signs,  to
           respond to reports of abuse  and  to  access  services  in  this
           regard.
         *  that educators be workshopped  and  trained  on  the  children's
           rights set out in the African Charter on the Rights and  Welfare
           of the Child and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to
           raise awareness of  these  rights  among  children.  This  would
           fulfil some of South Africa's  obligations  in  terms  of  these
           treaties to publicise as widely as possible the rights contained
           therein.
         *  that policy and  legislation  be  reviewed  in  accordance  with
           international children's rights instruments  ratified  by  South
           Africa.
         *  that the outcome of the public hearings held by the  Task  Group
           be publicised and be made available as widely as  possible.  The
           Task Group undertakes to make a copy of this Report available to
           each government department for consideration and  implementation
           of the recommendations contained therein.
         *  that the official text of the African Charter on the Rights  and
           Welfare of the Child and the UN Convention on the Rights of  the
           Child, as well as  any  other  international  children's  rights
           instrument that  is  or  becomes  binding  on  South  Africa  be
           published in the  Government  Gazette  in  order  to  create  an
           official point of reference.
         *  that the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the  Child
           be translated into easily accessible language and be distributed
           to all schools and public  offices  throughout  the  country  in
           order to raise public awareness  of  children's  rights  and  to
           fulfil part of South Africa's obligation under the Charter.
         *   that  the  relevant  Parliamentary  Committees  follow  up  and
           monitor the implementation of the recommendations  made  to  the
           various government departments. For this purpose it is suggested
           that these committees invite the departments concerned to  brief
           them on progress made in realising the recommendations not later
           than six months after the adoption of this Report and that  each
           of these committees report to the National  Assembly  not  later
           than 12 months after the adoption of this Report.
