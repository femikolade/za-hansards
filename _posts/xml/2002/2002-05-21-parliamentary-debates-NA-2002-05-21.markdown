                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that in Ward 32 in the Makhado Municipality in the far north of
       the Limpopo Province, the ANC retained the seat with an  overwhelming
       96% of the vote;


  (2)  further  notes  that  the  DA,  commonly  known  as  the   ``Defunct
       Alliance'', received only 11 votes; and


  (3) congratulates the ANC on its victory, which proves that  despite  the
       shouts of the DP, the ANC remains the  political  home  of  the  vast
       majority of the South African people.
[Applause.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the policy of the former  National  Party  government  to  dump
       unwanted people far from the city centre;


  (2) further notes the New NP/ANC Premier Peter Marais's  plan  to  remove
       500 000 people to Atlantis;


  (3) recognises that -


       (a)  unemployment in Atlantis is already a serious problem;


       (b)  the public transport system from the west  coast  is  hopelessly
           inadequate; and


       (c)  the roads are severely overcrowded; and


  (4) calls on the ANC/New NP to explain exactly how and when they plan  to
       build houses and schools, create jobs and provide transport  for  500
       000 additional people.
[Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf
of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the African Renaissance was one of  the  most  significant
       initiatives  of  the  new  Government  because  it  aimed  at  giving
       recognition to African institutions, cultures and mores in order that
       300 years of colonial and apartheid legacy could be reversed;


  (2) recognises that these imperatives are as  compelling  today  as  they
       were eight years ago;


  (3) calls on the House not to  obliterate  institutions  and  centres  of
       cultural and historical importance; and


  (4) therefore calls on the House to invest in them and strengthen them so
       that the African Renaissance is given continuous impetus.

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the rugby trials which were held in Pretoria on Sunday;


  (2) recognises the abundance of young talent evident at these trials;
  (3) further notes that the absence of players who have opted out of South
       African rugby did not detract from the standard of play;


  (4) recognises the right of players to play overseas; but


  (5) condemns those players of questionable ability who cite racial quotas
       as the reason for leaving when they may fail  to  make  the  national
       team on merit.
[Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mev die Speaker, ek gaan namens die Nuwe NP voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1)  by  monde  van  Agri-Suid-Afrika,  kennis  neem  van  die  positiewe
       ingesteldheid van Suid-Afrika se kommersiële boere wat  wil  verseker
       dat  grondhervorming  in  ons  land  suksesvol  verloop  en  dat  die
       onwettige, destruktiewe  plaasbesettings  wat  Zimbabwe  se  ekonomie
       uiteindelik vernietig het, nie hier plaasvind nie;


  (2) Suid-Afrika se  boeregemeenskap  gelukwens  met  hulle  konstruktiewe
       betrokkenheid deur toe te sien dat genoeg geskikte  landbougrond  vir
       die vestiging van opkomende boere beskikbaar gestel word; en


  (3) die boere se plan steun om 'n nasorg-mentorstelsel  in  die  lewe  te
       roep  waarvolgens  ervare  boere  van  die  omgewing  by   wyse   van
       kenmerkende gulhartige buurmanskap, beginnerboere met  raad  en  daad
       bystaan om te verseker  dat  hulle  hul  suksesvol  as  deel  van  'n
       gelukkige boeregemeenskap vestig.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes, by way of assurance  from  Agri  South  Africa,  the  positive
       disposition of South Africa's commercial farmers who want  to  ensure
       that land reform in our country takes place successfully and that the
       unlawful, destructive occupation of farms,  which  finally  destroyed
       Zimbabwe's economy, does not take place here;


  (2) congratulates the South African farming community on its constructive
       involvement by seeing to it that enough suitable agricultural land is
       made available to settle emergent farmers; and


  (3) supports the plan of the farmers to create an aftercare mentor system
       through which experienced farmers from  the  area  will,  by  way  of
       typical genial neighbourliness, assist novice  farmers  by  word  and
       deed so as to ensure their successful  establishment  as  part  of  a
       happy farming community.]

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the UDM at the  next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the successful launch in the  Eastern  Cape  yesterday  of  the
       Thuthuka Skills Project aimed at improving the quality  and  teaching
       of mathematics and accountancy  for  Grade  10  to  12  scholars,  by
       providing  study  guides  and  giving  additional  support  to  their
       teachers;


  (2) salutes the efforts of  the  South  African  Institute  of  Chartered
       Accountants, which has spearheaded this initiative;


  (3) welcomes the R62 million that the Department of Labour has  committed
       to this initiative; and


  (4) notes that the Thuthuka Skills Project involves South  Africans  from
       all spheres of society, including UDM President Bantu  Holomisa,  who
       have  in  their  personal  and  professional   capacity   joined   in
       partnership to improve the skills base of the country and  contribute
       to making South Africa a winning nation.
[Applause.]

Mrs M M MALUMISE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  that  skin-lightening  creams  containing  hydroquinone   are
       prohibited by law on account of their toxicity, their scarring effect
       on the skin and possible cancer-causing properties;


  (2) further notes that on  Monday,  following  the  seizure  of  a  truck
       transporting about four tons of skin-lightening  creams  from  across
       the border, 12 people were arrested  as  a  result  of  an  intensive
       investigation by the organised  crime  unit,  the  Medicines  Control
       Board and customs officials;


  (3) commends the responsible agencies for the successful arrests; and


  (4) warns all South Africans that the use of skin-lightening creams  will
       result in scarring, disfigurement and possibly cancer.
[Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the escalating gang violence in Lavender  Hill  in
       the Cape Flats where an eight-year-old child was killed, who is being
       buried today, and a four-year-old was injured recently due  to  stray
       bullets, as well as all primary schools in the area being  forced  to
       close;


  (2) also notes that gang  violence  in  the  area  has  been  allowed  to
       escalate unabatedly, resulting in the children  being  constantly  in
       fear of their lives and their education being negatively affected;


  (3) further notes that the community members of Lavender Hill are furious
       with the Government, as nothing  has  been  done  to  this  point  to
       alleviate this problem, while their children continue to die and live
       in fear; and


  (4) calls on the Government to intervene immediately  on  behalf  of  the
       parents and children of  Lavender  Hill,  before  more  children  are
       allowed to die.

Mr D C MABENA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the executive Mayor of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Council,
           Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, launched a huge housing project  in
           a soil-turning  ceremony  on  18  May  2002  at  Lotus  Gardens,
           Tshwane; and


       (b)  this project is driven by the Tshwane  Metropolitan  Council  in
           partnership with the  Gauteng  Provincial  Government  and  will
           empower communities, especially women;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the implementation of this project  will  contribute  positively
           towards urban renewal in Tshwane; and


       (b)  this demonstrates  the  commitment  of  the  ANC  Government  to
           building a better life for all our people through the  provision
           of affordable housing;


  (3) welcomes this project; and


  (4) commends the provincial government of Gauteng and the City of Tshwane
       for ensuring that our people will have access to affordable houses.
[Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the DA has uncovered a  secret  bank  account  in  Setsoto
       Municipality in the Free State that was used  to  buy  groceries  and
       supply ANC councillors with loans;


  (2) notes that this unauthorised  expenditure  is  a  blatant  misuse  of
       ratepayers' funds;


  (3) therefore calls on the ANC to take the moral renewal of South  Africa
       seriously by acting against councillors who abuse their positions  in
       order to enrich themselves; and


  (4) congratulates the DA councillors who play an important oversight role
       at  local  government  level  by  ensuring  that  the   ANC   remains
       accountable for their malfeasance.
[Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  behalf  of
the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that both this Government and all public institutions in  South
       Africa are premised on the principles of democracy, transparency  and
       accountability;


  (2) further notes in the context of the above principles the intention of
       Sadtu to call a strike in respect of the intention of the  department
       to institute a whole school evaluation system, because this  was  not
       linked to the development evaluation system;


  (3) recognises that there are considerable merits in  developing  further
       the evaluation systems in our schools to achieve optimal results  and
       maximum pupil growth;


  (4) calls  on  Sadtu  to  engage  on  this  matter  with  the  department
       constructively and in the best interest of education  in  order  that
       thorough evaluation takes place on an agreed upon basis; and


  (5) furthermore calls on Sadtu not to resort to  disruptive  means  which
       would impact negatively on the learners while all other avenues  have
       not been fully explored.

Mrs N L NKABINDE: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of  the  UDM  at  the
next sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with  horror  that  the  Minister  of  Education  has  recently
       reported that  only  39%  of  HIV/Aids  funding  has  been  spent  by
       provincial education departments;


  (2) notes that this is not a new problem, since R10  million  in  unspent
       HIV/Aids funding had to be rolled over from  the  previous  financial
       year;


  (3) expresses its shock that the Eastern Cape  education  department  has
       spent less than 6% of their HIV/Aids  funding  to  date,  whilst  the
       Limpopo provincial department has spent less than 16%; and


  (4) calls on Government, whilst an estimated one-third  of  teachers  are
       infected with  HIV,  to  intervene  in  this  dire  mismanagement  at
       provincial level to prevent a  large-scale  catastrophe,  which  will
       undermine the education of our children.
[Applause.]

Mr B A RADEBE: Madam Speaker ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hold on, hon member.

Mr D M BAKKER: Madam Speaker, on a point  of  order:  In  your  allowing  of
motions, you skipped my party, the  New  NP,  and  gave  the  UDM  a  second
opportunity before we had our opportunity. I just want to clarify that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: In terms of the list in front  of  me,  I  am  still  on
track, so if there is a mistake somewhere, it is in the document itself  and
therefore will have to be clarified later and sorted out accordingly.

Mr B A RADEBE: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a R9 million project to compile  a  map  of  exactly  what
       covers every piece of South African land was launched in Pretoria  on
       Wednesday, 15 May 2002;


  (2) further notes that this project will be  critical  for  planning  and
       reporting on the state of the environment, forest and water  resource
       planning and management, spatial development initiatives, land reform
       programmes, local development and planning and rural development;


  (3) believes that this initiative is  a  major  boost  to  the  country's
       commitment to sustainable development and  the  maintenance  of  bio-
       diversity; and


  (4) commends the responsible departments and bodies for  undertaking  and
       funding this critically important project.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Before I call the New NP, I would  just  like  to  point
out that there might have been some mistake in compiling  the  list  itself.
That will be clarified and we will come back to the New NP about whether  we
owe them another opportunity.

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  the  declarations  by  Mr  Carl  Werth,   previous   regional
       chairperson of the DA in Gauteng North and leader of the DA caucus in
       Tshwane Metro City Council, that the DA -


       (a)  was built on a platform of treachery;


       (b)   is  a  right-wing  party  that  is  inevitably  becoming   more
           authoritarian;


       (c)  prescribes ethics and morals for the Government,  but  does  not
           apply the same standards to its own activities;


       (d)  in fact meant ``fight black'' with their ``fight back'' campaign
           and their black public representatives were  nothing  more  than
           window-dressing;


       (e)  often uses the ``K'' word; and


       (f)  has sacrificed liberal democracy on  the  altar  of  hon  Leon's
           ambition;


  (2) further notes how hastily this prominent leader in the  DA,  who  has
       received countless letters of praise from Leon, is now referred to as
       a ``thoroughly unprincipled man'', ``motivated entirely by resentment
       and a desire for revenge'', by his own party; and


  (3) predicts that many other prominent, principled DA  leaders  are  also
       going to be called ``thoroughly unprincipled'' after the crossing-of-
       the-floor legislation comes into effect.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The time for Notices of Motion has  expired,  but
I give the UDM an opportunity which they missed last time.

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the UDM at the  next
meeting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with horror  the  gruesome  details  of  the  numerous  murders
       committed by the Bruma Lake killers, that emerged during their trial;


  (2) welcomes the several life sentences that  were  handed  down  by  the
       judge  yesterday,  as  an  affirmation  that  criminal  violence  and
       brutality are not acceptable in our society; and


  (3) congratulates the police investigators and the state  prosecutors  on
       their hard work and dedication, and urges them to continue to protect
       the lives and security of all South Africans.
[Applause.]

                           VICTORY FOR EAST TIMOR

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:

That the House -


     (1)    notes that the struggle for  independence  for  East  Timor  has
         finally ended 450 years of foreign rule with  the  proclamation  of
         independence on Monday;


     (2)    believes that this is a significant victory for  the  forces  of
         democracy;


     (3)    notes that our Deputy President, the Honourable Jacob  Zuma,  is
         attending the independence celebrations  on  behalf  of  the  South
         African people, who have supported the struggle of  the  people  of
         East Timor; and


     (4)    wishes President Xanana Gusmao and his government a warm welcome
         to the community of nations and wishes the people  of  Indonesia  a
         peaceful and prosperous future as an independent nation.

Agreed to.

          CONGRATULATIONS TO BAFANA BAFANA ON 2-0 WIN OVER SCOTLAND

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:

That the House -


  (1) congratulates Bafana Bafana on their exciting 2-0 win  over  Scotland
       in their World Cup warm-up clash;


  (2) believes that the hard work done by the team is paying off  and  that
       this victory bodes well for South Africa's World Cup campaign; and


  (3) wishes them well in their next match.

Agreed to.

                      CONDEMNATION OF THE US FARM BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns the US Farm Bill as a major step backwards from free trade;


  (2) recognises that the huge subsidies being given to US farmers -
       (a)  make a laughing stock of trade negotiations at the  World  Trade
           Organisation; and


       (b)  ensure that developing  countries  will  be  unable  to  compete
           equally for markets; and


  (3) calls on the US government  to  reconsider  this  ill-advised  policy
       which seriously threatens commercial farming in southern Africa where
       increasing numbers of people are already  facing  starvation  due  to
       recent droughts.

Agreed to.

            PLANS FOR CAPE TOWN PARTNERSHIP TO ATTRACT INVESTORS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with approval the  plans  of  the  Cape  Town  partnership  for
       attracting investment to the city, including -


       (a)  the marketing of sections of the city for specific activities;


       (b)  the development of  an  "e-city"  for  e-commerce  and  internet
           enterprises;


       (c)  the development of markets for informal traders; and


       (d)  the improvement of parking and security throughout the city; and


  (2) agrees that this will enhance Cape Town's ability to provide  a  good
       standard of living for its residents and help to attract tourists.

Agreed to.

          CONGRATULATIONS TO SAPS INVESTIGATORS ON RECENT SUCCESSES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the South African Police  Service  investigators  whose
       hard work and diligence in the Bruma Lake serial killings case led to
       an effective prosecution and resulted in long sentences for  the  two
       killers;


  (2) welcomes the R800 000  Mandrax  bust  at  Johannesburg  International
       Airport as another small victory in the war on drugs; and


  (3) hopes that there will be  many  more  such  successes  in  the  fight
       against crime.

Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                 Debate on Vote No 31 - Trade and Industry:
The MINISTER OF TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  chief
executive officers and chairpersons of the DTI family  of  institutions  who
are sitting up there - as members can see, our mass rally is on the right  -
ladies and gentlemen, the work of the  DTI  covers  a  very  wide  range  of
economic activities. It is not possible to deal with all of  these  in  this
budget address. We have made available supporting information  and  we  hope
that this will be of use to all members in their own constituency work.

As our new democracy develops we  need  to  assess  whether  we  are  making
progress in providing for a better life for our people.  We  have  developed
policies  and  implemented  them.  The  effect  of  this  process  will   be
increasingly measurable. As I have stressed in previous budgets  since  1996
the process we are undergoing is a profound structural change. The  question
is: Are we advancing? I believe that we are.

Today, I would like to pay  tribute  to  South  Africa's  entrepreneurs,  to
those people who  take  risks  to  create  employment,  generate  value  and
contribute to our economic success. These are the people that  are  building
new economic enterprises and they give us all cause for hope.

I would like to introduce to the House Ms Pinkie Luswazi, who  is  up  there
in the gallery. She is an entrepreneur from the  Eastern  Cape.  [Applause.]
Pinkie started her clothing  business  after-hours  while  studying,  making
school uniforms, matric  dance  dresses  and  wedding  gowns.  What  she  is
wearing there is also one of her products.

Pinkie works with disabled women to equip them with skills that will  assist
them in gaining  employment.  Her  entrepreneurial  spirit  has  been  given
practical support by the DTI through  training  in  export  orientation  and
through export marketing assistance enabling her to market her  products  in
France and the USA.

Another example is Bell Equipment, an enterprise that has grown  from  being
a  small  engineering  and  equipment  repair  service   into   a   globally
competitive equipment designer,  manufacturer,  and  preferred  supplier  of
capital equipment  across  the  world.  Bell  Equipment  has  exploited  the
benefits of participating in the DTI's programmes.

A South African entrepreneur whose recent exploits in  space  have  inspired
us all is Mark Shuttleworth. By South Africa becoming  part  of  the  global
economy an enterprising young man developed his innovative idea and sold  it
for a huge profit, helping to place South Africa on the global  IT  map  and
Mark in space. He  also  sits  on  the  President's  Information  Technology
Advisory Council. Most members may have seen our  exhibits  next  door,  and
will see that South Africa manufactures satellites. Maybe, one day, we  will
manufacture space stations.

Cobus Cronje, a mechanical engineer from the  Cape,  has  re-engineered  the
technology of exhaust emissions so as to reduce fuel  bills,  breakages  and
downtimes. This is another example of South African ingenuity having  global
reach, as major truck manufacturers around the world adopt  this  home-grown
innovation.

These entrepreneurs and  the  enterprises  they  are  building,  along  with
thousands of others like them, are the reason why I am  so  confident  about
the future success of our economy. The DTI, by providing the right  products
and services, helped make it possible for them to realise  their  goals  and
contribute to our national efforts to create a better life for all.

The incentives offered by the DTI have even added spice to my own  favourite
flame-grilled chicken, Nando's. Nando's has chosen to locate its  new  spice
factory for worldwide distribution in South Africa.

The basic philosophy underlying the restructuring of the DTI  is  to  ensure
that we can develop the products and the  offerings  to  our  citizens  that
will facilitate the development of  the  people  and  enterprises.  We  need
confidence  in  our  economy.  Scepticism  is  important  in  avoiding  wild
fantasies, but too much of it becomes a millstone preventing growth.

Our objective is to make an impact on the lives of ordinary  people  in  the
real economy. I would like to pay tribute  to  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Trade and Industry and, of course, the select committee of the NCOP for  the
support they give us in highlighting the importance of the real  economy  in
the lives of people. Not only do they spend considerable time  in  assessing
this budget  but  they  also  hold  hearings  and  investigations  that  are
essential in increasing the level of  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the
economy and the challenges that we face.

We are now at a point where we  can  assess  changes.  Today  we  release  a
detailed and frank account of changes in the real economy.  I  believe  that
we can use this assessment along with the new strategy  documents  that  are
now being brought out to build a greater degree  of  consensus  on  economic
issues and the path that the economy can take.

We have gone through a lot in the last  few  years.  The  report  shows  the
extent of the changes and the challenges that remain. What emerges  is  that
we now have a situation in the real economy that is the basis for  equitable
growth and development within a global economy.  The  DTI  Budget  Vote  can
advance this shared vision for our economy.

Building a consensus on economic  policy  is  not  easy.  In  1994  the  new
democratic Government inherited an economy in  crisis,  inherently  unstable
and in long-term decline. Government took some tough, but necessary,  policy
choices to shift the economy onto a more  sustainable  growth  path  and  to
confront the challenge of delivering prosperity to all of our  people  while
also repositioning ourselves as a nation in the global economy.

This  involves,  in  part,  opening  up  our  economy  to  the   forces   of
globalisation, and this presented us with a new set of  challenges.  At  the
same time the state  was  undergoing  a  fundamental  transformation.  South
Africans had expectations about what the new democratic state would  deliver
in a relatively short period of time. These factors combined to  reduce  the
level of trust between the union movement and Government as the former  felt
that fundamental policies were being changed.

In the case of business, there was a lack of confidence that the  Government
would do the right thing. We are now in a better  position  to  assess  what
has happened. It is a relatively complex story, but all signs  point  to  us
having a strong economic basis to move forward. What is  important  is  that
we use this basis and do not get held back  in  long  arguments  about  what
should have been.

The economy we have today is fundamentally  and  irreversibly  different  to
that which we inherited in 1994. The economy is stable and  growing,  albeit
slowly, and our manufacturing base has proved to be robust  and  capable  of
competing in a global economy. Our restructured economy  means  that  higher
rates of growth can be attained.  The  active  role  adopted  by  the  state
through a set of macroeconomic and microeconomic  reforms  was  instrumental
in bringing about this economic restructuring. We  started  to  engage  with
the global economy through  our  trade  policies  and  our  entry  into  the
international capital markets.

Nedlac has played a significant  role  in  getting  us  to  this  moment  by
keeping the key economic actors talking to one  another  in  a  constructive
manner throughout the past seven years. There has not always been  agreement
but there has been contact, consultation and  debate  and  differences  have
been aired.

This is fundamental to a democratic reform process.  We  need  to  build  on
this and consolidate levels of trust and a coherent economic  strategy  that
has the committed support of all social partners.  This  would  be  a  major
instrument in the acceleration of growth and  development.  This  should  be
our objective for the growth and development summit.

Government has strengthened its institutional capacity and understanding  of
how our economy works. Our  attention  must  now  turn  to  identifying  the
practical measures that need to be taken  by  Government,  business,  labour
and civil society, to achieve our shared vision. Talk  is  cheap  -  we  now
need action!

Government has identified the steps that it  will  be  taking  to  make  our
economic vision a reality. The President undertook  to  intensify  the  work
that was started in 2001 to build the economic infrastructure and lower  the
cost  of  inputs  through  the  managed  liberalisation  of  the  transport,
telecommunications and  energy  sectors.  These  actions  are  contained  in
Government's  Microeconomic  Reform  Strategy,  an  integrated  approach  to
removing the impediments to growth, employment and equity that  fall  within
the direct purview of the  state.  We  have  provided  hon  members  with  a
narrative of the Microeconomic Reform Strategy. I hope it will be useful  as
this is the first time that such a document has been made available.

As the Department of Trade and Industry  we  have  taken  the  Microeconomic
Reform Strategy to the members of the DTI group that are here today  and  to
provinces, and are working with  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government to take the strategy to the  municipal  level.  These  Government
structures are aligning their priorities and actions  to  the  Microeconomic
Reform Strategy, reflecting the advancement of  co-operative  governance  in
our country.

The contribution of different sectors  to  the  country's  GDP  has  changed
significantly.  Primary  production  such  as  agriculture  and  mining  now
contribute much less to the economy than the tertiary  or  services  sector.
The tertiary sector now contributes almost two-thirds of our GDP. This is  a
shift that has occurred in most industrialising nations. This does not  mean
that agriculture and mining are  unimportant.  Indeed,  we  must  focus  our
efforts on how  to  further  exploit  our  endowments  and  the  comparative
advantage of these sectors through beneficiation and the developing  of  the
value matrices that we spoke of in the Integrated Manufacturing Strategy.

However, it does signify, this change, that economic  growth  and  new  jobs
are likely to come from the tertiary sector, and this has  implications  for
human  resource  development,  for  the  provision   of   telecommunications
infrastructure and for investment patterns.

A second trend  in  our  economy  is  the  changing  skills  composition  of
production. There has been a dramatic shift in the  demand  for  labour.  In
every sector of our economy highly skilled labour  is  in  high  demand  and
vacancies cannot be filled. At  the  same  time  the  demand  for  unskilled
labour has dropped in every sector.  This  has  given  rise  to  a  mismatch
between demand and supply conditions in the labour market. It has an  impact
on the patterns of unemployment and the resultant poverty that will need  to
be addressed by clear state intervention.

There has been a deepening of technology in our economy.  This  third  trend
is manifest in the rising capital-to-labour ratios in all  sectors,  despite
the relatively high cost of capital.  This  suggests  that  cheaper  capital
may, in fact, exacerbate the unemployment problem that we face.

While export performance has been  excellent,  especially  with  respect  to
manufactured exports, South Africa's share of global trade  is  falling  and
there is a spectre of  rising  protectionism  following  the  imposition  of
tariffs on steel  by  the  US  and  the  truly  incomprehensible  Farm  Bill
recently introduced. These signs are nothing less than  disastrous  for  the
wellbeing of the global economy.

Aggregate levels of output in  South  Africa  are  not  increasing  rapidly,
although South Africa's manufacturing sector weathered the  global  downturn
far better than many of its competitors, who experienced large  contractions
in production. This information is contained in the  appendix  of  the  Real
Economy Report. There is bullish sentiment about the future  performance  of
the economy. Manufacturing output, exports, investment rates and  employment
are all forecast to grow  in  the  short  term.  We  must  work  quickly  to
capitalise on this positive sentiment.

The  Integrated  Manufacturing  Strategy  published  recently   provides   a
coherent framework for our collective  actions  to  convert  these  positive
developments into sustained and high levels of growth and development.

The DTI has worked hard over the past  two  years  to  better  equip  it  to
contribute to the realisation of our shared  vision.  The  basic  structural
changes in the DTI are complete. We have some fine  tuning  to  do,  and  we
have to consolidate new ways of working.

We will commence construction of the new DTI campus  building  soon  and  it
will provide the  new  modern  facilities  that  we  need  to  complete  our
restructuring. The Council of Trade and  Industry  Institutions,  Cotii,  is
functioning and,  as  I  have  indicated,  many  of  the  leaders  of  these
institutions  are  here  today.   The   presentations   of   the   council's
organisations to the  portfolio  committee  have  provided,  I  believe,  an
insight into the operations of these  very  important  institutions  in  our
economy.

The DTI has done good work designed to tailor our product offerings  to  the
needs of the  changing  economy.  We  are  improving  our  response  to  the
challenges of small business development  and  black  economic  empowerment.
These last reviews have taken time, as they are not easy matters,  yet  they
are fundamental.

Having completed the restructuring of the architecture of the  DTI  and  the
Integrated Manufacturing  Strategy,  we  will  shortly  complete  these  two
further important strategy documents on small business  and  black  economic
empowerment.

In line with the objectives of our restructuring, the  DTI  is  meeting  the
needs of its customers. Madam Deputy Speaker ... Sorry, Mr Chairman.  It  is
always safer to check what is behind one. I suppose in the  DA  it  must  be
really problematic, though. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

In line with the objectives of our restructuring, the  DTI  is  meeting  the
needs of its customers. Allow me to  share  with  this  House  some  of  the
highlights of this work.

The time taken to register a new company or a close corporation  has  fallen
from 21 days to three days - an impressive improvement in efficient  service
delivery. [Applause.] In the previous  financial  year  the  DTI  registered
over 30 000 new companies and almost 90 000 close corporations.

In the area of trade regulation, approximately  20  000  import  and  export
permits were issued and 3 000 import rebate certificates and  2  500  rebate
permits were also issued. Over 100 tariff investigations were conducted.  In
a short time I will  have  the  pleasure  of  placing  before  the  National
Assembly  the  International  Trade  Administration  Bill.  This  Bill  will
establish a modern and independent regulator of international trade for  the
entire  Southern  African  Customs  Union.  This  will  coincide  with   the
conclusion of the lengthy Southern African Customs Union negotiations.

Market  access  opportunities  continue  to   expand   for   South   African
enterprises. A significant achievement  was  the  work  done  to  secure  an
exemption from US tariffs on South Africa's steel  products.  My  particular
thanks go to Deputy Minister Lindiwe Hendricks for the hard work she did  in
this regard. The wine and spirits agreement was concluded with the  European
Union and the DTI started to prepare itself for the Doha round.

Our delivery to small businesses continues to improve. Since  its  inception
the Khula Enterprise Agency has generated 1 million jobs.  In  the  previous
financial year Khula issued R141 million in credit  guarantees.  Two  thirds
of this went to black-owned enterprises and almost 40% went  to  women-owned
enterprises.

Manufacturing advice centres have  opened  in  the  Western  Cape,  Gauteng,
Limpopo, North West and Mpumalanga. Through the work  of  the  Manufacturing
Advice Centre 28 000 jobs were created  and  536  small  businesses  in  the
manufacturing sector have been assisted. To date  Ntsika  has  supported  80
000  small  and  medium  enterprises  and   has   trained   over   100   000
entrepreneurs. These are significant figures.

The Brain website has some 300 affiliates and  is  a  key  link  with  small
business. In the packs  that  we  gave  hon  members  today  we  included  a
brochure on Brain. I would recommend that hon members have a look at it  and
see the affiliated organisations. There is a CD-Rom as well, and I think  it
will be clear to hon members that there is tremendous  capacity  to  support
manufacturing enterprises throughout South Africa.

The Coega Industrial Development Zone has been proclaimed and  the  operator
appointed. Cabinet has also recently approved industrial  development  zones
in East London and Richard's Bay. The Strategic Investment Programme is  now
in place and the adjudicating committee for this programme  has  started  to
consider applications.

South Africa exported 106 000 fully assembled automobiles in  2001  and  the
auto industry accounts for 5,6% of GDP. This is not bad for a new  democracy
in an African country that has just emerged from a major  period  of  social
conflict.
Trade and investment promotion  and  facilitation  activities  yielded  R4,6
billion of foreign direct investment into South Africa and R1,2  billion  of
export orders. The Export Credit Agency is now fully operational.

I must admit, however,  that  the  DTI  has  not  always  provided  economic
citizens with the most efficient or effective service.  Last  year  in  this
House I gave an undertaking to investigate new  marketing  and  distribution
channels to improve our service, and I am confident that this  is  beginning
to happen, as I believe hon members would have seen in the  exhibition  next
door.  Currently  we  are  reviewing  all  our  products  and  services  for
efficacy, as well as examining innovative ways to improve  the  delivery  of
these products and services, based  on  the  findings  of  the  DTI's  first
annual customer survey.

Should  hon  members  seek  information  from  the  DTI  about  its  product
offerings for any of their constituents, then I urge them to  remember  this
number: 0861-the-DTI. I know that all hon members have cellphones.  If  they
want to remember our number, 0861-843-384, all they  have  to  do  is  spell
0861-the-DTI on the keys  of  their  cellphones.  This  is  very  simple  to
remember,  and  I  appeal  to  all  hon  members  to  use   it   for   their
constituencies. It is the number of the  DTI's  new  customer  care  centre,
which I  am  pleased  to  announce  became  operational  yesterday,  with  a
dramatic increase in calls. If anyone wants to  test  it,  it  is  available
next door.

I would like to thank the  portfolio  committee  for  their  usual  thorough
analysis of our budget. There are no major changes from last year,  although
I believe that our reporting on the outcomes  is  improving  and  that  this
trend will continue. A very useful summary of the  budget  and  what  it  is
designed to achieve is available to members.

I am particularly  pleased  at  the  massive  improvement  in  the  internal
reporting that is now available to me on a monthly basis. This allows us  to
keep track of the most important dimensions of performance. I  also  believe
that we can say with a great deal of pride  that  we  are  building  a  very
professional DTI that is truly reflective of all our  peoples.  Hon  members
can see it there.

We have one area to address, and that is that we are below  our  target  for
the employment of disabled persons.  We  could  claim  technically  that  we
still have time to achieve this target, but in all other cases  we  are  far
in excess of the target and far in advance of it, so this is  an  area  that
we will address.

I would like to pay tribute to the director-general  and  his  team  of  top
management. They are a wonderful team and are, for  me,  the  embodiment  of
the new and vital South Africa.

The priorities for the DTI in the coming year are  to  further  improve  our
service delivery of appropriate offerings and to forge  strong  partnerships
for performance. The latter are collective actions  that  we  need  to  take
toward defined objectives. The importance of these  partnerships  was  dealt
with in the Integrated Manufacturing Strategy. Partnerships  and  collective
action are the only mechanisms capable of taking  us  forward  in  the  long
run.

However, we will have to change some of  our  old  habits.  All  the  social
partners face challenges in this new environment. Business  has  to  develop
new  management  practices  and  strategies  to  face   the   challenge   of
globalisation. Businesses have to form new and mutually beneficial  compacts
with their workers. They have to learn to work together for common  ends  as
South African enterprises, even though they will  still  be  competing  with
each other.

Our  new  economic  path  requires  new  ways  of  organising;  it  requires
knowledge networks, the sharing of best practice and the  diffusion  of  new
technologies amongst enterprises. The weakness of organised business  is  an
increasingly serious obstacle to progress. As a  result  of  this  weakness,
our chamber movement is also weak.

It is critical that  we  understand  the  fundamental  change  occurring  in
production. The enterprise - be it a private company or a co-operative -  is
the basic agent of  change  in  a  knowledge-driven  economy.  However,  its
capacity  to  change  is  dependent  on  the  collective  success  of   many
enterprises and the leadership given  by  the  state.  The  success  of  the
interaction between enterprise development  and  collective  endeavour  will
lie at the very centre of our economic success.

It follows from this basic point that  the  union  movement  is  faced  with
renewed challenges. If enterprises change, it is essential that  the  plant-
based and enterprise-level organisation of workers must change in  response.
The union movement in South Africa must urgently return to its  strength  of
plant-based unionism.

This does not mean that industrial  unionism  must  change.  It  means  that
industrial unionism based on enterprise-level work  and  local  shop-steward
councils is the only basis of  strength  and  service  to  members.  If  our
unions do not meet this renewed challenge, they  may  fall  into  the  fatal
trap of trying to pressure the state to represent workers.

The recent gains in the achievements in  collective  bargaining  of  the  SA
Clothing and Textile Workers' Union are to be truly welcomed  and  must  now
translate into stronger plant-based organisation in this priority sector.

We need to reinvigorate programmes like the  Workplace  Challenge.  The  DTI
will also be running a trade-and-industrial-policy training programme  on  a
biannual basis for shop stewards to build a  greater  understanding  of  our
economy. The DTI will work to strengthen its  partnership  with  unions.  We
need an economy based on decent work for all.

We need also to build new enterprise forms. This is essential if we  are  to
ensure  more  equitable  development  and  to  add  vitality   to   economic
activities. The DTI is working with collective  movements  -  trade  unions,
civics, the SA Communist Party - to develop co-operatives.  These  movements
must, however, increase their efforts toward this end.

It is a matter of concern that there was an absence of  strong  voices  from
social movements in the recent public hearings on  industrial  strategy.  We
must strengthen civil society's ability to engage  in  the  economy  and  to
take its rightful place in critical economic debates. We  need  it  to  join
hands with the DTI in customising interventions  and  delivering  the  DTI's
products and services to our communities.

As the DTI we have a role to play in raising awareness  about  the  workings
of  our  economy.  A  key  initiative  in  this  regard  will  be  the   DTI
entrepreneurial train that will be  pulling  into  a  station  near  you  in
coming months. The DTI entrepreneurial train will provide  people  in  small
towns and rural villages with an opportunity to  spend  time  with  business
mentors, with officials of the  DTI  and  with  members  of  the  trade  and
industry group.

The South African economy is poised to be a growth leader. It  requires  our
confidence to ensure that this happens. The personnel and top management  of
the DTI will do all in their power to realise our vision of  a  growing  and
equitable economy that leads to development for all.

My thanks to the parliamentary  committees,  the  DTI  and  Deputy  Minister
Hendricks - who, I suspect, is watching this on TV, and we all  wish  her  a
speedy recovery - for their support and hard work. It is a  great  privilege
to be a Minister in such a fine and committed department. We  will  build  a
better life for all. [Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES: Chairperson, economic history records few, if any,  cases  of
former colonial  or  semicolonial  countries  having  successfully  promoted
industrialisation or significant  economic  development  without  an  active
leadership role by the state. This role  involves  more  than  acting  as  a
referee over the conduct of economic citizens or  being  sound  managers  of
public finances, important though those tasks undoubtedly  are.  Those  very
few cases in history where developing  countries  have  achieved  even  some
modicum of success in promoting  industrial  development  have  all  had  in
common states playing an active role in the formulation  and  implementation
of strategies, in mobilising key stakeholders around  these  strategies  and
in providing resources and services to back them.

When the President announced at the opening of Parliament in  2001  a  shift
in the focus of economic policy from the pursuit of macroeconomic  stability
to microeconomic reform, the work of the Department of  Trade  and  Industry
was thrust to the very forefront of our efforts to promote the  development-
orientated growth which we have called for repeatedly since 1994.

It is not that the DTI was not extremely active in the period  between  1994
and 2000. It had succeeded in promoting a sense of  urgency  about  economic
restructuring in the  face  of  the  challenges  of  globalisation,  thereby
contributing  significantly  to   averting   the   very   real   threat   of
deindustrialisation that confronted our country in the early 1990s.

The department  succeeded,  too,  in  creating  opportunities  for  a  rapid
increase in manufactured exports, which rose from 39% of  total  exports  in
the early 1990s to 51% in 2000. The  department  also  laid  the  foundation
for, and began delivery on, a series of other initiatives, notably on  small
business support, which a study commissioned for Khula  claims  assisted  in
creating or sustaining 788 000 permanent or temporary, formal  or  informal,
jobs in small enterprises over the five-year period from 1996 to 2001.

What this shift in the focus  to  microeconomic  reform  highlights,  in  my
view, is the necessity for the DTI to achieve a big  leap  forward  both  in
its strategic capacity and in its operational efficiency.

The United Nations Conference on Trade  and  Development  report  for  2002,
which was released last month, points to a worrying pattern of  subordinated
integration of the manufacturing sectors  of  developing  countries  into  a
still highly uneven and unequal global economy. The report points out  that,
and I quote:


  While the share of developing countries in world  manufacturing  exports,
  including those of rapidly growing high-tech products, has been expanding
  rapidly, the income earned from such activities does not appear to  share
  in this dynamism.

The information provided in the Integrated Manufacturing Strategy  document,
to which the Minister referred,  appears  to  indicate  that  South  African
industry is far from being immune to the threat of becoming subject to  just
such a pattern of subordinated integration. The IMS document indicates  that
the export dynamism of  our  manufacturing  sector  was  not  matched  by  a
proportional increase in incomes or value added, with  manufacturing  output
increasing by only 1,8% per annum on average.

Moreover, as the IMS document acknowledges, and I  quote:  ``Job  losses  in
manufacturing have tended to accelerate''  and  ``the  manufacturing  sector
has  been  consistently  shedding  labour''.  All  of  this,  in  my   view,
underscores an imperative for the DTI to work  smarter,  more  strategically
and more effectively to place our economy on the kind of  growth  path  that
we need to be on to raise incomes and  enhance  economic  opportunities  for
our people.

The Rules of Parliament provide for parliamentary committees  to  deal  with
the legislation of the corresponding department, to exercise  oversight  and
to engage on policy issues. The Portfolio Committee on  Trade  and  Industry
has been active in all of these activities over the past year. As this is  a
Budget Vote debate, I will concentrate largely on  the  issue  of  budgetary
oversight. This year, our portfolio committee  has  engaged  on  this  issue
much more intensively than in the past. We have had, on my count,  at  least
four meetings  with  the  department  on  budgetary  matters  both  here  in
Parliament and at the department's headquarters in  Tshwane.  We  have  also
engaged on budgetary matters with some of the Council of Trade and  Industry
Institutions.

The committee adopted a report which was published in the ATCs  of  May  13.
That report records significant  and  welcome  progress  both  in  financial
management and in  aligning  the  department's  budget  to  its  operational
activities. A few years ago, DTI was noted for underspending its  budget  in
some years by as much as 30%.  That  underspending  has  been  significantly
reduced, although at something like 10%, for 2001-02, it  remains  too  high
and points to issues that still need to be addressed.
A feature of our budgetary oversight this year is that we received,  at  our
request, a report on the extent to which the  department  had  delivered  on
the output  targets  identified  in  the  2001-02  budget.  Many  indicators
ranging from a significant reduction in the number of dropped calls  to  the
shortening of the time  that  it  takes  to  register  a  company  or  close
corporation, to which the Minister  referred,  all  point  to  a  department
which is operating more efficiently and effectively.

The restructuring exercise which was embarked on some  years  ago  certainly
seems to be paying off. A mood of commitment,  hard  work,  seriousness  and
professionalism by an increasingly competent cadre of  young  professionals,
most of whom are now from disadvantaged communities,  is  evident  when  one
visits the department.

The next challenge in the  budgetary  oversight  which  we  have  identified
together with the department is to link output performance to outcomes,  and
to  monitor  with  convincing  indicators  the  extent   to   which   output
performance has contributed to the achievement  of  the  identified  outcome
goals of growth, employment and empowerment. Success in  this  respect  will
not just be a matter of developing reporting systems,  it  will  provide  us
with measurable  indicators  on  the  extent  to  which  the  department  is
succeeding in rising to the challenge facing it and the economy. One of  the
major challenges in  this  regard,  in  my  view,  is  the  formulation  and
implementation of  an  industrial  or  manufacturing  strategy  to  take  us
forward to the year 2014.

As indicated earlier, the  DTI  has  released  an  integrated  manufacturing
strategy document. This document is still subject to further refinement  and
consultation. The publication of the IMS document was followed by two  weeks
of public hearings on industrial policy conducted by our  committee  and  by
our colleagues in the National Council of Provinces. We are in  the  process
of preparing a report which, we  hope,  there  will  be  an  opportunity  to
debate in this House in due course. Today,  I  just  want  to  say  that  we
detected considerable agreement on  some  of  the  key  themes  in  the  IMS
document on the need to facilitate and encourage  dynamic  linkages  between
traditional manufacturing and other sectors including services, as  well  as
between formal and informal productive  activity  through  integrated  value
matrix strategies.

There was also substantial agreement on the need to  promote  a  shift  from
dialogue  to  collective  action  on  the  part  of  stakeholders,  and  for
customised packages and support measures from the department.  At  the  same
time, some very real tensions arising not just from subjective positions  of
drafters but, more importantly, also from the objective  circumstances  that
our economy finds  itself  in,  also  became  evident.  These  included  the
tension  between  promoting  competitiveness   in   existing   manufacturing
activities and promoting  the  development  of  new  productive  activities,
particularly in the areas outside the  established  industrial  centres  and
among disadvantaged people. This is partly linked to, but not reducible  to,
a tension between export-orientated sectors and those activities  which,  in
the short and medium term at least, could be realistically  expected  to  be
largely confined to the domestic market.

Adjusting to a knowledge economy or applying  knowledge  is,  of  course,  a
major challenge in this era of  informationalism.  But,  it  does  not  mean
quite the same at the two poles of those tensions that I  referred  to.  For
example, in the public hearings, we identified the need for  the  Industrial
Development Corporation to adopt a more  strategic  approach,  implying  the
injection of a higher knowledge component, in its efforts to give effect  to
its mandate in order to, and I quote:


  ... identify opportunities not yet addressed by the market in respect  of
  its work to promote local economic  development  and  support  small  and
  medium enterprises.

No one would seriously argue that we can afford to focus our  programmes  at
any one of the poles of these tensions to the total exclusion of the  other.
But there are some very real questions of balance and priority.

I believe that there is now an urgent need for our policies to have  a  much
more visible and direct impact on the income  and  employment  opportunities
of the masses of our people. My comrade MaNtuli is not  scheduled  to  speak
today, so I want to borrow her phrase for which she has  become  quite  well
known recently: Our policies cannot only  be  for  the  benefit  of  men  in
suits. The promotion of collective action across and up and down  integrated
value matrices must yield tangible benefits  to  the  poor,  workers,  rural
women and the disadvantaged people generally. Clearly, this is  a  challenge
that will have to be responded to by more than manufacturing  policy  alone.
It  will  require  more  effective  empowerment;  small,  medium  and  micro
enterprises and training programmes; and, indeed, policies  to  address  the
entire raft of issues identified in the Microeconomic Reform Strategy.

The DTI is also responsible for international  trade  negotiations.  Looming
large are the multilateral negotiations agreed to at the fourth World  Trade
Organisation's Ministerial meeting held in Doha  in  Qatar  during  November
last year. I do not have time to address this important topic in any  detail
today, but I do want to say that I believe that both we in South Africa  and
the developing world in general have much to do to  ensure  that  the  gains
that the developing countries were able to secure in the Doha declaration  -
for which Minister Erwin deserves full credit for having  played  a  leading
role - are not swamped in the detailed negotiating processes by  demands  of
vested interests in rich countries.

There are, in my view, some worrying signs  that  the  demands  or  requests
that  developed  countries  are  formulating  to  present  in  the  detailed
negotiating processes may have very little resemblance to the  developmental
principles that they claim to support. We should also be  concerned,  in  my
view, at the apparent willingness of some developed countries to cave in  to
the domestic protectionist lobbies in the very  grandfather  industries  and
sectors which a more equitable  global  trading  system  demands  should  be
ceded to developing countries. The US Farm Bill, which was referred to in  a
motion by Mr Gibson earlier on and by the Minister, and the  threat  by  the
US to remove, at the behest of domestic lobbies, canned pears from the  list
of preferences available to  South  Africa  under  the  African  Growth  and
Opportunity Act are recent examples of this kind of protectionism.

The DTI clearly has a very full programme in the year ahead.  Our  committee
also looks likely to have a busy year ahead. I would  like  to  congratulate
both the Ministry and the department on their achievements to date. I  would
also like to thank the Minister, the Deputy Minister - and I also  wish  her
a speedy recovery - the director-general, the staff of the departments  and,
particularly, the officials assigned to the parliamentary liaison  work  for
always having been available to us in the committee and for assisting us  in
carrying out our tasks. I look forward to further  fruitful  engagements  in
the year ahead.

The ANC will, of course, support Budget Vote No 31. [Applause.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Mr Chairman, we have just had an example of  the  ``Erwin  and
Davies law''. The greater the time available, the greater the volume of  hot
air. [Interjections.]

Every now and then  a  tiny  ray  of  light  enlivens  these  somber  budget
debates. So I refer hon members to the report of the Portfolio Committee  on
Trade and Industry on page 2.  It  says  that  in  the  previous  year,  the
department ignored half of its incoming telephone calls, but that last  year
it failed to answer only one third of them. What  remarkable  progress!  All
must be well, God is in his heaven, Marx is in his grave, the Speaker is  on
her throne, and the Ministry plans to  move  to  a  fancy  new  headquarters
being  built  among  the  office  glut   in   Pretoria.   How   reassuringly
appropriate!

The good news goes on. Between 1996 and March last year, 789 000  jobs  were
created through a DTI agency, of which 70% are  unlikely  to  be  sustained.
And that is a conservative estimate by Barney Pityana's comrades  at  Unisa.
It is on page 5.

The public accounts committee is being  urged  by  the  Auditor-General  not
only to consider departmental outputs, but to examine also  outcomes.  Alas,
I cannot be exuberant about the  latter  as  I  have  just  been  about  the
former. This country is about to face, for the second time within a  decade,
an upturn in the commodity cycle. This means  that  without  any  help  from
Coega Kevin, Judge Myburgh or Deutsche  Bank,  the  rand  could  strengthen,
inflation reduce, investment surge upwards and jobs begin emerging.

Last time  we  were  in  that  happy  position  we  contrived  to  miss  the
opportunity because there was not enough new supporting investment.  So  the
rand lost half its value, inflation is heading to double digits by year  end
and the ranks of the unemployed and poor  are  steadily  increasing.  If  we
miss this upturn in this cycle, I can foresee  a  dollar  costing  at  least
R20, domestic prices rising at least  12%  and  more  than  2  million  jobs
having been lost since the ANC came to power, and the girth of the  Governor
of the Reserve Bank expanding by another six inches.

So, we must measure the outcome of the DTI's spending against  what  it  has
done, or proposes to do, to complement macroeconomic  policy  and  encourage
rising investment. Let me quote from the latest  DTI  news  update  entitled
``A Busy Year Ahead''. This is what it plans: to hold  a  policy  symposium;
change the name of the Board on Tariffs and  Trade  to  the  Commission  for
International Trade Administration; introduce a new Liquor Bill; refine  and
clarify the role of its agency Ntsika, which created  the  790 000  new  but
unsustainable jobs; send the Deputy Minister to examine the gender  equality
of the DTI; examine the funding  of  hawkers  who  need  loans  of  R200  to
R2 000; draw the various DTI quangos  -  SABS,  CSIR,  IDC,  etc  -  into  a
council of trade and industrial institutions from whence it can be  directed
by bright young economists from the Get Ahead Foundation; turn the DTI  into
a Nando's Chicken brand, all fat and feathers; and prevent private decision-
making from leading  investment  by  adopting  an  industrial  manufacturing
strategy that places too much emphasis on political convenience rather  than
economic utility.

What wonderful stuff for a leading industrial economy in Africa! But  is  it
going to have a direct and salutary impact on fixed capital investment?
This is what it  needs  to  do:  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  and
encourage entrepreneurial activity by reregulation so  that  free  trade  is
enhanced  and  there  is  less  inappropriate  Government  intervention  and
increasing competition.

This will,  if  done  properly,  enhance  the  allocation  of  resources  by
markets, increase productivity and help adaptation to  the  global  economy,
which grew between 1960 and 1980, but up until then largely  excluded  China
and India. Since their inclusion, globalisation has reduced  the  number  of
poor by 200 million.

The DTI needs to seek appropriate trade agreements with traditional  trading
partners and those whose  economies  are  convergent  with  ours  to  reduce
barriers and foster a rules-based international trading system. It needs  to
privatise its quangos - from the IDC to the CSIR - instead of attempting  to
build a ministerial empire. It needs to contain an inappropriate  exuberance
and not confuse circuses with communication. This is what  global  investors
want to see. What will see them off is a whiff  of  arrogance,  if  the  DTI
thinks it can outwit markets, for it will be spitting against the  wind  and
worldwide experience that will  ultimately  overwhelm  it,  and  our  entire
internal economy.

The jobless, the poor and the indigent might then just as well head for  the
hopeless comforts of Harare, with a Cronin poem in  one  hand  and  a  lotto
ticket in the other. In short, the DTI is not delivering the  outcomes  that
are even remotely appropriate to our economic situation. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, I reserve the right to disagree with the  verbal
diarrhoea of my hon  friend  and  close  colleague,  the  hon  Nigel  Bruce.
[Applause.]

An HON MEMBER: Justify that!

Mr H J BEKKER:  Yes,  through  the  discussion,  I  will  certainly  justify
myself.

The 2002-03 budget of the Department of Trade  and  Industry  represents  an
increase of R400 million on  the  previous  financial  year.  Much  of  this
increase is due to an increase in  the  allocation  to  Programme  5  -  the
Enterprise Organisation, which consists of a range of transfers to  business
support initiatives. This programme represents  34%  of  the  total  of  the
DTI's budget.

The DTI informed Parliament that the main reason for  the  increase  in  the
allocation to Programme 5  was  that  it  expected  better  take-up  of  the
business support programmes. The IFP certainly hopes that the department  is
accurate in its expectations, not only  for  the  sake  of  goal-driven  and
clear budgeting, but  also  for  the  sake  of  business,  which  definitely
requires departmental support.

The DTI's budget includes an amount of R1,32 billion which is set aside  for
incentives and offerings to business. This  amount  has  increased  by  R320
million from the previous financial year. The IFP applauds the Minister  and
the department for allocating the additional funding.

There is, however,  a  lack  of  clarity  about  the  exact  programmes  and
allocations which are intended  for  support  to  small,  medium  and  micro
enterprises. It is often agreed that the SMME sector is a strong  engine  of
economic growth and  job  creation.  The  IFP  certainly  agrees  with  this
argument. But we would like to request the Minister to provide more  details
about the SMME programmes and particularly the support  programmes  to  this
House.

Khula Enterprise Finance provides loans and  guarantees  to  the  banks  for
business ventures. Keeping in mind the risk-averse nature of  South  African
financial  institutions,  it  seems  shocking  that  Khula  will  only  loan
approximately R106 million  and  provide  loan  guarantees  for  about  R406
million in the current financial year. This, to my mind, is  too  little  to
adequately support the emerging entrepreneurial sector of South  Africa  and
it will have dire consequences for job creation and economic growth.

On top of  its  limited  loan  guarantee  figures,  it  is  clear  that  the
recapitalisation of Khula is still a major concern. The  DTI  was  requested
to provide some R200 million two years ago, but to my mind  it  has  applied
only about R110 million to date. It would seem that the  DTI  has  not  made
further commitments to recapitalising Khula in this regard.

One of the regulatory bodies under the authority of the  DTI  is  the  Micro
Finance Regulatory Council, which deals with microlending matters. There  is
no doubt that a large section of  the  South  African  public  requires  the
specific financial services provided by microlenders.  Of  course,  they  do
not deserve the so-called loan sharks that  are  still  operating,  some  of
them with absolute impunity.

The IFP has always favoured a just, equitable and fair  regulatory  approach
to microlenders and their customers. Nevertheless, it has become clear  that
bad debt is taking its toll on the industry, and not  just  on  the  smaller
players. Witness the losses due to the bad debt at  Absa  subsidiary  Unifer
and the pressure placed on Saambou Bank  by  microfinancing  debt  provision
and it becomes obvious that the financial  services  industry  is  facing  a
number of very serious challenges.

South Africa can ill afford instability in our financial services  industry.
Increasing bad debt resulting from microlending  operations  could  lead  to
instability. In  order  to  avoid  the  economic  fallout  from  small  bank
failures, we should be asked whether microlending regulation should  not  be
further strengthened and generally tightened up.  The  IFP  would  therefore
call on the Minister to take the initiative and to  launch  a  comprehensive
review of the existing regulations in conjunction with all stakeholders.
The Department of Trade  and  Industry,  together  with  the  Department  of
Finance, plays a vital role in creating the environment  in  which  economic
growth can be accelerated to double digit annual  rates.  It  is  no  secret
that South  Africa  has  not  achieved  the  higher  economic  growth  rates
envisaged  by  Gear.  Most  stakeholders  would  agree  that  the   economic
fundamentals are firmly in place, but where are the growth and  massive  job
creation that are needed?

Recently, the idea of an economic growth summit or indaba bringing  together
Government, labour and business  to  discuss  accelerating  growth  and  job
creation has received much  public  attention.  In  fact  most  stakeholders
support this idea, but apparent squabbles between the ruling party  and  its
alliance  partners  over  fundamental  policy  differences  have  thus   far
scuppered plans to hold such a summit. It is absolutely imperative  that  we
find ways of accelerating economic growth which,  in  turn,  would  lead  to
large-scale job creation.

The IFP is also greatly concerned about  the  lack  of  skilled  workers  in
South Africa. Apart from the training, we simply will have to import  skills
to this country, whether we like it or not. The  Director-General  of  Trade
and Industry told us that most South Africans were so  unskilled  that  they
were unemployable without massive new training  programmes  and  that  there
are severe shortages of highly skilled people to run  key  sections  of  the
economy. This implies the need for a massive drive to recruit  experts  from
abroad, and one would think that the easier this was  made,  the  better  it
would be for the economy as a whole. This  lack  of  skills  is  also  being
recognised by Labour Minister Mdladlana, who said that the rationale  behind
the National Skills Development Strategy and the introduction  of  a  Skills
Development Levy had been the increased demand for skilled workers, who  are
in short supply, and the fact that  most  unskilled  people  face  long-term
unemployment without that specific training.

The IFP therefore simply could not understand the insistence of the  ANC  on
complicating and bureaucratising  the  skills  importation  clauses  of  the
Immigration Bill. One can understand this  perception  from  among  hawkers,
crafters and flea market stallholders, where foreigners threaten to  squeeze
out locals  with  their  more  exotic  wares.  But  on  the  factory  floor,
laboratories and in some high-finance houses we do  need  skills  which  are
just not available in enough numbers locally to help us keep pace  with  the
changing world economy.

Die IVP was nog altyd 'n kampvegter vir die regte van die  verbruiker,  maar
ongelukkig word daar van Regeringskant nie genoeg gedoen om  die  verbruiker
te beskerm nie. Verbruikersakehowe het nie dieselfde magte as  siviele  howe
nie, maar het slegs die magte van 'n tribunaal.  Verbruikershowe  kan  beter
beskerming bied.

In Australië word klem gelê op verbruikersbeskerming  deur  middel  van  die
bemiddeling en billike handel. Verbruikersbeskerming is doeltreffend,  omdat
alle instellings wat vir verbruikersbeskerming verantwoordelik is onder  die
sambreel van 'n kantoor vir billike handel optree. Ek stel voor dat  ons  na
hierdie dinge kyk. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The IFP has always been a champion of  the  rights  of  the  consumer,  but
unfortunately not enough is being done from  Government's  side  to  protect
the consumer. Consumer affairs courts do not have the same powers  as  civil
courts, but merely have the powers of  a  tribunal.  Consumer  courts  could
offer better protection.
In Australia the emphasis is being placed on consumer protection by  way  of
mediation and fair trade. Consumer  protection  is  effective,  because  all
institutions responsible for consumer protection act under the  umbrella  of
an office for fair trade. I propose that we take a look at these things.]

The IFP will support  the  2002-03  Budget  Vote  and  we  congratulate  the
Minister on what has been achieved here. [Applause.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Chairperson, South Africa can be  proud  of  many  of  its
achievements over the past  eight  years;  achievements  in  the  political,
social, human rights  and  economic  spheres,  particularly  in  respect  of
macroeconomic stability, increased discipline in  financial  management  and
an improved tax collection regime.

Yet we cannot deny that  in  critical  areas  of  our  economic  development
process, we have not progressed sufficiently. Here we think of job  creation
as mentioned by a number of speakers in  the  Department  of  Labour  Budget
Vote last Friday, the alleviation of basic poverty, the reduction in  income
and wealth inequalities and a more balanced geographic spread of  productive
activities. We know there is no simple panacea for  these  challenges.  Most
elements of the Government's economic and social strategy  impact  on  these
problem areas, with gradual progress being made.

There is, however, one area which seems to impact very closely on  virtually
each of these listed problem areas, namely, the  small  business  sector  or
the growth and spread of small, medium and micro enterprises, the SMMEs.  It
is also one of the key drivers in  the  Government's  Microeconomics  Reform
Strategy.

It is not possible to deal with the array of issues  contained  in  the  six
programmes of the department within my  allocated  time.  Therefore  I  will
focus only on one subprogramme in Programme 3,  namely  the  development  of
policies and strategies for SMMEs, also mentioned by other hon members.

The SMME community  has  in  recent  years  witnessed  with  satisfaction  a
worldwide growing awareness of the importance of SMMEs to both the  national
and the global economy. There seems to be  growing  recognition  that  SMMEs
are engines of growth and  of  job  creation,  that  they  are  vibrant  and
innovative  and  that  they  are  flexible  and  can   adapt   to   changing
circumstance. It is quite clear today that as a  result  of  those  virtues,
SMMEs have become a central force in the economy and society.

Statistics suggest that small enterprises, as opposed to  big  business  and
the public sector, contribute about 40% to  South  Africa's  gross  domestic
product, about 54% to overall employment and about 20% to exports. In  sharp
contrast to the widespread shedding of labour in the  public  and  corporate
sectors, SMMEs have, over the past decade,  maintained  positive  employment
growth in most economic sectors.

Notwithstanding progress in many different areas of the economy,  the  small
enterprise sector of South Africa does not yet reflect  the  characteristics
found in Asian, European and American high-growth countries. An example  one
can cite is Japan, where 98% of all  enterprises  belong  the  SMME  sector,
whilst 80% of the total industrial labour force is employed in that  sector.


In fact, we cannot deny a few rather disturbing trends.  Small  business  in
South Africa is still characterised by  the  dominance  of  micro  and  very
small enterprises with only limited  growth  potential.  Large  segments  of
small business are not competitive, either with foreign competitors or  with
bigger firms. There is a lack of enterprise  and  business  skills  among  a
high percentage of the self-employed. The majority of SMMEs  still  complain
about  a  lack  of  access  to  finance.   SMME   support   structures   and
organisations  are  fragmented,  with  little  or  no   uniform   acceptable
standards.  In  this  context  what  is  particularly  disturbing  is   that
duplication of services within all  the  provinces  and  turf  wars  between
support organisations typify this support sector. According to  a  directory
of SMME support organisations released by the Cape Town  Unicity  there  are
over 1 300 service providers in the Cape Town Metropolitan  Area  alone,  in
other words excluding the rural areas. Finally, there is a  widespread  lack
of understanding of Government policies and support programmes.

Thus, while our small business sector is a lot more dynamic  than  those  of
many less developed countries in Africa and elsewhere, we are certainly  not
in the lead of small-business-driven  countries.  If  we  want  to  progress
faster with respect to the goals mentioned earlier we have to  mobilise  our
small business sector. This will require action in  the  public  sector,  in
the private sector and in co-operation between them.

Let me stress this need to  progress  on  both  fronts  at  the  same  time,
together with joint action  in  some  areas.  It  is  often  suggested  that
Government has to step in to fill the gaps in  the  access  to  finance  for
micro enterprises in both urban and  rural  areas.  Yet  such  complementary
steps cannot be sufficient given the vastness of our country  and  the  high
cost of establishing  a  national  network  of  offices  for  a  new  public
institution. Banks of all kinds just have to also play a  facilitatory  role
and the process of increasing the diversification of financial  institutions
has to continue in order to do justice to  the  different  needs  of  SMMEs.
[Time expired.]

Mr D LOCKEY: Chairperson, I rise to speak in support of the  Vote  on  Trade
and Industry. It is with great reluctance that I am going to waste a  minute
of my time to respond to the unfortunate speech by Mr Bruce.

Mr Bruce, once more, made a very  destructive  contribution  in  this  House
today. But one cannot blame him for his ignorance,  because  his  visits  to
the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry are very infrequent,  and  the
few  times  he  attends  these  meetings  he  sleeps  most  of   the   time.
[Interjections.] So he misses out on all the valuable  reports  on  progress
in the Department of Trade and Industry.

In a recent speech the CEO of McCarthy's, Mr Brand  Pretorius,  singled  out
some people in South Africa as suffering  from  the  ``doughnut  syndrome''.
This syndrome is an obsession with the hole in the middle and a  failure  to
see the sweetness that surrounds it. Today we  had  a  prime  example  of  a
person suffering from this doughnut syndrome in the form  of  Mr  Bruce.  Mr
Bruce can only see the negative and he cannot see any of the  many  positive
things that are beginning to emerge in our economy. Mr Bruce can  only  make
a contribution if he stops his arrogance and his  destructive  attitude  and
starts making a positive contribution in the debate on the  many  challenges
that face our economy.

In February last year the President  announced  an  integrated  action  plan
aimed at addressing South Africa's microeconomic constraints on  growth  and
development. The Government has done a lot of work since  this  announcement
and the DTI has played a  pivotal  role  in  working  towards  building  our
microeconomy, and the  Minister,  in  his  introductory  speech  today,  has
mentioned many of the steps taken by the department. I  want  to  thank  the
Minister, the Deputy Minister and the department for the work that has  been
done so far. It is clear that there are  still  many  challenges  remaining,
but we have made a concerted effort and we are hopeful that  many  of  these
outstanding challenges will be addressed in the months to come.

The most recent World Competitiveness Report ranks South  Africa,  the  only
African country to have made it onto this list, 39th out of 52 countries  in
the world.  South  Africa  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  most  competitive
countries in areas such as the cost of electricity to business and the  cost
of living index. In a recent newspaper survey it was found that the cost  of
A-grade office accommodation in  South  Africa  is  33  times  cheaper  than
comparable accommodation in London.

In areas of export growth South Africa is rated the second most  competitive
country in the world, second only to China out of 52 countries.  This  is  a
remarkable achievement, if one takes into account China's  large  population
and the high level of foreign direct investment  that  has  gone  into  that
country. This year South Africa is going to export 165  000  fully  built-up
vehicles all  over  the  world.  We  are  exporting  C-class  Mercedes  Benz
vehicles to Japan, the auto capital of the world. Last  night  there  was  a
report on the television news that there is congestion in Cape  Town's  port
because of the fact that our exporters  are  doing  extremely  well  at  the
moment.

The credit for this success must go to the Government and the Department  of
Trade and Industry, which, through their tireless efforts, have worked  over
the last eight years to restructure our economy to  make  it  more  globally
competitive and to ensure that we have  market  access  through  free  trade
agreements like, for example, the European  Union-South  Africa  Free  Trade
Agreement.

There are also many challenges  highlighted  by  the  World  Competitiveness
Report. South Africa has fared poorly in areas  such  as  attracting  enough
foreign direct investment. South Africa is still ranked 49th out  of  52  in
areas such as discrimination on  the  grounds  of  race  and  gender.  South
Africa  also  rates  poorly  in  areas  such  as  interest  in  science  and
technology, and  economic  literacy.  We  are  not  faring  well  enough  in
research and development spending compared to other emerging markets.  There
is therefore room for improvement in these areas.

The issues highlighted so far contain many of  the  opportunities  but  also
the challenges that face our country today. This year's budget debate  takes
place against the backdrop of a renewed focus on growing and developing  our
microeconomy. The department has recently introduced a  comprehensive  plan,
the Integrated Manufacturing Strategy, aimed at  enhancing  our  competitive
strengths and addressing our shortcomings in order to make  South  Africa  a
world-class competitor. Gradually there is a consensus beginning  to  emerge
on an industrial strategy; a strategy that will place us on a higher  growth
path with higher levels of investment and employment creation.

In this process there are areas that require some urgent attention, and  the
Minister has referred to some of these, such as the shortage  of  skills  in
our economy. A recent study by  the  World  Bank  in  partnership  with  the
Gauteng Metropolitan Council has identified the shortage of  skilled  labour
as one  of  the  main  bottlenecks  for  business  growth  and  development.
Approximately 80% of manufacturing firms in this study reported  extreme  to
moderate difficulty in  finding  people  with  professional  and  managerial
skills. Seventy percent of firms reported extreme to moderate difficulty  in
finding people with service and craft skills.

The study inferred that if such shortages are experienced during periods  of
moderate economic growth, the situation  is  likely  to  get  worse  as  the
economy starts growing at a more  rapid  pace.  Despite  the  shortage,  the
study found that only 35% to 45% of the firms surveyed provided training  to
approximately a third of their workforce. So  there  is  clearly  more  that
business can do to try to alleviate the skills shortages in this country.

We know that they are not making optimal use of the skills  levy.  A  recent
survey of major South African banks listed skills migration as  one  of  the
biggest  challenges  facing  our  economy.  The  director-general  has  also
pointed out that there could be a shortage of up to 500 000 skilled  workers
in our economy. This is indeed one of the major challenges we are facing  if
we want to achieve high levels of investment and economic  growth  in  South
Africa.

In order to deal with the issue  it  is  important  to  understand  the  key
drivers of  economic  growth  in  today's  global  economy.  Manuel  Castell
summarised the key features of the new informational economy as follows:


  The  source  of  productivity  and  growth  lies  in  the  generation  of
  knowledge,  extended  to  all  spheres  of  economic   activity   through
  information processing.

The new economy has  increased  the  importance  of  occupations  with  high
information content in their  activity.  The  key  challenge,  according  to
Castell, is  to  organise  a  production  system  around  the  principle  of
maximising knowledge-based productivity through  information,  co-ordination
and integration.

The new Integrated Manufacturing Strategy aims to  achieve  precisely  these
objectives. What is abundantly clear is that business and other agencies  of
Government will have to pull out all the stops to ensure  that  we  overcome
the challenge of skill shortages in our economy  through  training,  curbing
the outflow of skilled workers and attracting skilled migrants.

One also hopes that the new Immigration Bill that was passed  by  Parliament
last week will assist in alleviating the  looming  skills  shortage  in  our
country. The reality is that skilled  workers  are  the  primary  source  of
economic growth and development  today.  We  must  compete  with  all  other
countries of the world for this valuable resource if we are  going  to  meet
the challenges of global economy.

The second issue I wish to dwell on  is  investment  in  the  underdeveloped
areas of our economy. One of the key challenges we face as a country and  as
a government is to address  the  pervasive  underdevelopment  in  the  rural
areas and in the townships. This is a fundamental requirement in creating  a
socially stable and economically equitable society.

Eight years into the democratic order,  South  Africa  still  rates  poorly,
according to the World Competitiveness Report, on issues pertaining to  race
and gender. We are still living in one of the most unequal societies in  the
world, and for as long as inequality persists,  Mr  Bruce's  arrogance  will
persist. Blacks still  bear  the  brunt  of  the  high  unemployment  levels
experienced  in  this  country.  Rural  black  women  are  still  the   most
marginalised group in South Africa today. As much as 47% of black women  are
unemployed compared to 14% of white women. A total of 40% of black  men  are
unemployed compared to 7% of white men.

According to the Microeconomic Reform Strategy document by  the  department,
economic weakness over the past few decades  has  led  to  declining  living
standards, high levels of racial, gender  and  geographic  inequalities  and
high levels of absolute poverty. Our inheritance of  low  human  development
manifests itself in the following:  GDP  per  capita  has  declined  sharply
since 1980 and has remained static over the past eight years;  South  Africa
has experienced little or no improvement in  the  quality  of  our  people's
lives as measured by the Human Development Index. This  is  in  contrast  to
other newly industrialised societies,  which  have  made  progress  in  this
area.

Poverty is particularly severe in provinces  that  fall  outside  the  major
metropolitan areas. A  total  of  50%  of  Free  State  households  live  in
absolute poverty, and 45% in the Eastern Cape, 39%  in  the  Northern  Cape,
38% in the North West and  37%  in  Limpopo  suffer  the  same  fate.  These
statistics underscore the need for further interventions by  Government  and
its agencies to assist with development  projects  in  these  underdeveloped
areas.

During our budget hearings we  had  an  opportunity  to  interact  with  the
Council of Trade and Industry Institutions and debate their role in  growing
our economy. The IDC has a mandate to provide risk capital to a  wide  range
of industrial projects,  to  identify  and  support  opportunities  not  yet
identified by the market and to invest in South Africa's human capital in  a
manner that reflects our diversity.

The IDC has  an  excellent  track  record  in  supporting  large  industrial
projects, but we need to see more involvement in the rural areas, among  the
historically disadvantaged communities. This would mean getting involved  in
areas of agricultural production, that  is  agroprocessing,  to  assist  the
rural households that are living in absolute poverty to become part  of  the
mainstream of the South African economy.

We need the  IDC  to  act  as  a  development  corporation  and  not  as  an
investment  bank  when  it  comes  to   these   historically   disadvantaged
communities. We have noted that the National  Empowerment  Fund  Corporation
is now fully constituted. The main objective of this fund is  to  facilitate
the  redressing  of  economic  inequalities   that   arose   out   of   past
discrimination, and to provide historically disadvantaged  individuals  with
opportunities to acquire shares and interests  in  restructured  state-owned
enterprises as well as in private  businesses.  This  is  a  very  important
institution that must assist black empowerment companies to become  part  of
the mainstream of South African business.

However, the current funding level of the NEFC is very low at  R200  million
and very little can be achieved with  this  funding.  I  therefore  wish  to
appeal to the Minister to ensure that  the  NEFC  is  adequately  funded  to
fulfil its mandate.

In conclusion, I wish to  briefly  address  the  issues  confronting  Nepad.
Earlier  this  year  the  Nepad  Implementation  Committee   finalised   its
programme.  Its  plans  highlighted  the  need  to   focus   on   the   many
socioeconomic  challenges  that  face  our  continent  in  the  process   of
achieving growth and development.

The  NIC  adopted  a  comprehensive  range  of  action  plans  covering  the
following:  agriculture  and  market  access;  infrastructure   development;
information  and  communication  technology;   capital   flow;   and   human
development, including health and education.

Many of these challenges can  only  be  addressed  if  the  developed  world
accepts the need for an equitable, just and fair global trading  system.  If
a significant portion of the US$1 billion  a  day  the  OECD  countries  are
currently spending on agricultural subsidy is  channelled  into  investments
and trade infrastructure on the African continent, we can realise the  dream
of making Africa and its  people  part  of  the  mainstream  of  the  global
economy.

I wish to thank the Minister  and  the  President  for  the  role  they  are
playing in the G8, the  World  Trade  Organisation  and  other  multilateral
organisations in working towards a fairer global  trading  system.  This  is
our only chance to give the  people  of  our  continent  an  opportunity  to
create a better life for themselves. [Applause.]

Mr C T FROLICK: Mr Chairman, hon Minister and hon members, the  Budget  Vote
of Trade and Industry should reflect the seriousness with  which  Government
approaches its role in the  economy,  especially  in  these  times  of  high
unemployment and poverty.

While discussing this Vote this afternoon,  it  is  apt  to  recognise  that
certain  South  African  industries  have  shown   phenomenal   growth   and
resilience even against international competition. The  motor  manufacturing
sector comes to mind. This confirms that it is, indeed, appropriate to  have
identified a knowledge-based economy  for  the  future  economic  growth  of
South  Africa.  But  this  should  not  mean  neglect  of   small   business
development.

The role of SMMEs as engines of job creation have been  clearly  articulated
this afternoon and must not be underestimated. Neither should we argue  that
SMMEs cannot enter  the  sector  of  knowledge-based  industries.  It  is  a
question of  encouraging  initiative  and  entrepreneurship  at  grass-roots
level. South Africans have proven that,  given  the  opportunity,  they  are
indeed innovators of note.

Only last week the headlines here in Cape Town were dominated by reports  of
a small business owner who developed a  new  technology  for  motor  exhaust
systems. Not only did he develop it, he also clinched  a  multimillion  rand
export deal to the USA. These initiatives should be encouraged.  This  is  a
prime example of the ability of South Africans to create  jobs  and  wealth.
How many more entrepreneurs are out there, undiscovered  and  with  untapped
talent, owing to a lack of support and opportunities? There is  no  stronger
mechanism available  to  the  Government  for  true  empowerment  than  SMME
development.

The Vote before us details extensively the various strategies that  DTI  has
at its  disposal  to  stimulate  trade  and  industry.  The  department  has
undergone a thorough and comprehensive internal restructuring  process,  and
it is therefore expected that delays on its  side  should  not  continue  to
hamstring economic initiative.

For example, one need only look at the  delays  that  have  crept  into  the
issuing of operating  licences  for  industrial  development  zones.  It  is
surely  not  unreasonable  to  expect   streamlined   and   more   effective
administration from the  Government's  leading  department  responsible  for
interaction  with  the  business  community.  We   therefore   welcome   the
acknowledgement this afternoon that problems  related  to  service  delivery
have occurred. We will support any measure that seeks  to  properly  address
these problems, and we are in particular support  of  the  new  hotline  for
members of the public as announced by the Minister this afternoon.

I  want  to  pay  attention  to  the  role  the  department  is  playing  in
international trade. The WTO is the premier forum  for  international  trade
agreements, and South Africa, as the leading economic force in  Africa,  has
an important role to play in that forum.  In  that  forum  not  only  do  we
represent ourselves, but we also carry the economic  hopes  and  aspirations
of SADC and the greater African continent. We cannot afford,  especially  in
the context of Nepad, to neglect our duties at the WTO.

However, during a portfolio committee visit to the WTO  it  became  apparent
that South Africa has a variety of important duties to fulfil at the  forum.
We therefore call on the Minister to reconsider the current  human  resource
deployment and support structure, so that our participation  in  this  forum
can be more effective. In  the  light  of  USA's  latest  Farm  Bill,  which
subsidises US farmers to the tune of billions of dollars for  the  next  ten
years, it is apparent that developing nations  such  as  South  Africa  must
increase their ability to negotiate at this level. It remains  a  matter  of
grave concern that South Africa and other developing  nations  are  expected
by the developed world to open up  their  economies,  and  to  refrain  from
subsidies, while they themselves continue with these practices.

It is often our industries that provide jobs to  unskilled  and  semiskilled
workers that bear the brunt of this policy. In the final analysis,  we  must
place the welfare and prosperity of our people first.

At the recent third annual African Business Development Conference  in  Port
Elizabeth, concerns were raised about South African trade practices  in  the
Southern African Customs Union, and how these  may  negatively  impact  upon
members of the union. We hope therefore that the  Minister's  comments  this
afternoon on the introduction  of  the  International  Trade  Administration
Bill will reflect and take on board the  concerns  of  all  members  of  the
South African Customs Union.

Fortunately, all is not doom and gloom in the country. The UDM supports  the
Bill.

Ms C DUDLEY:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  the  ACDP  again  registers  the
strongest  objections  against  the   Government's   policy   on   gambling.
Exploitation of the poor is not acceptable under any name, and  the  lottery
and casinos are no exception. Gambling has proven  to  be  unprofitable  and
cannot be defended in terms of benefiting the economy.  The  revenue-raising
ability of provinces was used as a carrot to con the  public  into  thinking
that vast amounts would be spent to alleviate poverty.

The reality, however, is  that  poverty  has  increased,  and  organisations
working to alleviate suffering receive little  or  no  assistance.  National
and provincial gambling boards have been set up and  are  costing  millions.
Provincial chairmen, for example, are earning in the region of R700 000  per
year. National and provincial gambling board chairmen, in the light  of  the
salaries received, should be required to publish their diaries.  This  would
give the public some  indication  of  what  they  are  doing  to  earn  such
exorbitant salaries. Sadly, they are like  vultures  feeding  on  a  rotting
carcass, feeding on society's weaknesses.

The gambling industry exploits man's weaknesses, and, along with many  other
Government  policies  and  legislation,  undermines  efforts  towards  moral
regeneration. This new culture promotes  greed  and  instant  gratification,
and undermines the need to  study,  family  life,  delayed  consumption  and
frugality.  Gambling  is  a  direct  attack  on  the  family   and   fosters
prostitution, money laundering, gangsterism, drugs  and  liquor,  industries
which also negatively impact on the spread of  HIV/Aids  and  upon  law  and
order.

The gambling industry is in real terms costing South Africans  millions,  if
not billions. With profits often being realised outside the  country,  where
is the benefit to  the  public?  Temporary  jobs  and  spending  during  the
building phase, and jobs created within  casinos  and  on  gambling  boards,
benefit only a few, and mostly only for a short period, leaving the  broader
public far worse off, with a trail of  brokenness  and  devastation  in  its
path. This is a serious issue, which Government should not make light of.

While bright lights and false promises  blind  and  mesmerise  many,  it  is
worth noting the  situation  in  other  countries.  In  the  Caribbean,  for
example, especially in Cuba, gambling, prostitution and  related  industries
were the order of the day, which caused instability throughout  the  region,
eventually resulting in revolution. The opulent, illusionary luxury  created
terrible resentment,  and  eroded  values  like  hard  work,  study,  family
development and frugality. Even Great  Britain  has  the  strictest  control
over licences, and  their  target  market  is  mainly  expatriates  and  not
citizens. Mature, stable societies, including  France  and  Switzerland,  do
not open their doors to gambling, but localise  and  ring-fence  it  because
they know it is not in the public interest. Others do not  entertain  it  at
all.

Even the USA limits gambling to specific locations and does not allow it  to
run like measles throughout the nation. The ACDP calls for a  stop  to  this
lunacy. At the very least there must be a  moratorium  until  an  assessment
can be made of how the industry  is  impacting  on  South  Africa.  To  date
impact studies done, show clearly the negative effects on society.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Deputy Chairman, it is important  for  the  people  of  this
country that when Parliament debates the budget,  we  reflect  also  on  the
policies on which the budget is based, and is to be spent. I therefore  want
to start this debate by saying, when the wealth  of  three  persons  exceeds
the combined gross domestic product of 48 countries, and the  ratio  of  the
richest and the poorest fifth of humanity steadily  deteriorates  from  30:1
in 1960, to 74:1 in 1997, then  any  talk  about  democracy  devoid  of  the
economic reality that affects the lives of our people in this country is  at
best shooting a mosquito for an elephant.

It is puzzling to note that the Department of Trade and  Industry  has  made
investment and market access the cornerstones of its  aims  and  objectives.
In a world where, between 1994 and 1999, Africa's share of trade  fell  from
8% to 2%, it is imprudent to have the entire  trade  strategy  on  an  equal
global trading system based on technology  monopoly,  financial  control  of
world  markets,  monopolistic  access  to  the  planet's  resources,   media
communications  monopolies  and  the  manufacture   of   weapons   of   mass
destruction. This is not a system that will bring development and  eradicate
poverty in our country.

The investment rules supported by South Africa's trade policy  provide  more
investor protection for foreign investors. It removes all forms of  domestic
competition, so that there is a monopoly for the foreign investors, who  are
able to secure control and ensure that new African  entrants  are  undercut.
This  brings  a  whole  range  of  other   dimensions   regarding   economic
oppression, violation  of  labour  rights  and  marginalisation  of  African
businesspeople. This is what frequently accompanies trade liberalisation  in
this country.

Today, where African business once thrived,  there  is  bankruptcy.  African
business has given  way  to  foreign  business.  Many  industrial  countries
profess  to  be  against  protectionism,  but   they   are   leading   trade
protectionists. Let us, for example, take the  recent  American  Farm  Bill.
The increase of 67% in the subsidy for American farmers  destroys  any  talk
of competition and fair trade for Africa's farmers.

Our country needs a national development strategy, which  promotes  regional
and continental integration more than global  integration.  Countries  which
have bought into global integration orthodoxy are discovering that  openness
does not deliver on its promises. Some of these countries are  South  Korea,
Malaysia and the People's Republic of China itself.

To the PAC it is clear that  the  World  Trade  Organisation  systematically
protects the trade and economic interests  of  the  rich  countries.  It  is
based on a paradigm that subjugates developing countries  to  take  measures
to accelerate their own  development.  The  WTO  raises  inequality  into  a
principle of decision-making. The WTO cannot possibly claim,  therefore,  to
serve the interests of the poor.

The PAC therefore fundamentally opposes South Africa's position  of  further
expanding the scope and power of  the  WTO.  This  will  only  increase  the
inability of our country to bridge the widening gap  between  the  rich  and
the poor. It will worsen the imbalances that  already  exist  in  the  world
trading system.

Mrs F MAHOMED: Chairperson, I wish to remind Mr Pheko that  our  development
plan and programmes are definitely geared towards serving the  interests  of
the poorest of the poor, in case he has not recognised that.

I wish to begin my speech in the name of God, the  Most  Gracious  and  Most
Merciful. Apartheid was a system  of  racial  capitalism,  institutionalised
racism and segregation which was enforced in all spheres of people's  lives.
Even today, megabusinesses are still owned by white conglomerates  as  there
was a deliberate attempt to marginalise people of colour.  Our  strategy  is
to promote a framework of sustainable  and  holistic  development  which  is
driven by the people.

It is imperative to understand  the  socioeconomic  background,  constraints
and challenges that  we  face.  Our  country  is  characterised  by  glaring
demographic, social and economic disparities. Our  struggle  for  liberation
has  always  advocated  poverty  eradication  and  sustainable  development.
Indeed, without economic liberty, prosperity can only be a dream.

We  do  see  a  paradigm  shift,  since  1994,  where  the   South   African
disenfranchised people are taking up market opportunities. They  are  taking
up ownership and exploiting economic development programmes which must,  and
should, improve the quality of our people's lives.

Our country's landscape is one of political stability  which  challenges  us
to seriously pay attention to issues of economic freedom. We need to  ensure
that women are not on the peripheries of the mainstream economy. We need  to
develop our human potential so that we  are  able  to  compete  with  global
markets  and  get  access  to  transnational  and   multinational   business
opportunities. Our capacity to invent and advance our  innovative  potential
should be exploited to the maximum.

Indeed, since the first democratic elections of  1994,  remarkable  progress
has been made towards establishing a free and democratic  society  which  is
based on respect for  basic  human  rights  and  human  dignity.  Women  are
marginalised groups. They are excluded from transnational and  multinational
networks and  subsequently  denied  access  to  contracts  and  megabusiness
opportunities which might become available to  private-sector  conglomerates
that are owned and dominated  by  men.  Skills  development  is  central  to
ensuring equality of  opportunity.  Therefore,  fiscal  shifts  should  take
place in order to ensure that women are empowered to take  up  trade-related
opportunities.

Knowledge about customs and antidumping regulations  and  trade  and  tariff
regulations can only  add  value  to  the  challenges  that  women  face  in
corporate  structures.  They  are  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  Most  major
financial institutions in South Africa do not know what it  is  like  to  be
poor. The sophisticated high-rise banking institutions  do  not  make  women
comfortable. At present we have the models of modern electronic  banking  in
a  land  where  many  of  our  citizens  still  require  electricity.  Rural
communities are dismally disempowered and disenfranchised. It is  imperative
that rural integrated  development  programmes  should,  hopefully,  address
this and measure input delivery to the poorest of the poor.

I would like to say  to  the  hon  the  Minister  that  buzz  words  in  his
department  indicate  that  a  world-class  institution  which  is  service-
orientated and delivery-driven is being created. I wish to point out to  him
that women in this country would appreciate it if they could have access  to
this world-class service delivery which will then be the  engine  of  growth
and sustainable development.

When I studied the incentives, I was pleasantly  surprised  that  the  Khula
Start  programme,  which  is  based  on  microcredit  outlets,  specifically
targeted  women  in  the  year  2000.  It  is  reported  that  89%  of   the
beneficiaries were women and 11% were men. However, I would  like  to  point
out to the hon the Minister that it would be interesting  to  determine  the
value of the loans that they  received.  It  is  noted  that  Khula  Start's
growth strategy aims at motivating banks to engage  in  mass-scale  delivery
by training bankers and marketers  and  providing  a  roll-out  of  credible
mentorship. That would be  really  good.  It  also  wants  to  research  the
package  of  innovative  products  to  attract  the  participation  of   the
financial industry. We do hope that  this  initiative  will  be  effectively
realised, as soon as possible.

The department has  initiated  a  number  of  projects  through  the  Ntsika
Enterprise Promotion Agency and aspires to showcase the very best  of  South
African arts and crafts. It hopes to  create  and  consolidate  partnerships
with national and  international  supporters  of  the  South  African  craft
sector. The international handicraft expo, which  took  place  in  Milan  in
December 2001, brought in market opportunities for South African crafts  and
assisted the small, medium and micro entrepreneurs. It  also  clarified  the
way forward to export markets and took the necessary actions to  ensure  the
survival and development of business.

I also wish to mention the future programme of Ntsika. The one that I  would
like to focus on  is  the  women's  development  programme,  which  aims  to
provide for the  participation  of  businesswomen  in  resource  management,
therefore improving the economic growth of South  Africa.  The  other  issue
that I would like to mention is the conference  on  women  in  business  and
management,  which  will,  hopefully,  address  the  needs  and   challenges
relating to the growth of women in business and clarify the way  forward.  I
suggest that we, as members, should diarise that, look  for  the  dates  and
inform our constituencies.

It needs  to  be  recognised  that  the  Support  Programme  for  Industrial
Innovation, technology incubators and Technology through Women  in  Business
should make quantitative and qualitative differences in the lives of  women.
Women are really tired of being on the peripheries.  They  should  and  must
drive transnational and trillion-dollar business. Our  supply-side  measures
could  easily  do  that  with   the   more   deliberate   focus   on   women
entrepreneurship.

Women cannot be in mere survivalist industries any more. They should  be  in
sustainable  industries  and  should,  actually,  be  now  looking   towards
biochemistry,  biotechnology  and  megaprojects  of  industry.  They  should
explore our export marketing and investment assistance scheme  in  order  to
become highly skilled and globally  competitive.  Women  must  be  empowered
through being made part of trade agreements and  included  in  international
trade negotiations so  that  they  are  able  to  understand  and  influence
important decisions which will, subsequently, impact on their lives.

We  need  to  commend  the  restructuring  processes  in   the   department,
especially the departmental and developmental programmes. The  women  cannot
be invisible in major  negotiations  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  trade
agreements, for example the European Union negotiations. They must serve  on
SADC, the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development  and  Nepad.  These  are
fundamental and effective policy formulations which can be  translated  into
realistic objectives. More women should and must be deployed to trade  desks
in our missions so that international experience will ensure that  they  are
holistically exposed to international trade,  and  further  exposed  to  the
multilateral institutions such as  the  IMF,  the  World  Bank,  Unctad  and
others.

Sufficient exposure to institutions such as boards of  tariffs  which  could
support women's initiatives to learn about customs, antidumping  and  tariff
regulations is imperative. Access to finance is the major setback for  women
who want to be mainstream players in our macroeconomic structure. I wish  to
mention the  fact  that  the  Micro  Finance  Regulatory  Council  needs  to
effectively carry out its mandate to ensure that equity is realised for  all
South Africans, especially the poorest of the poor.

The department needs to be commended in that all sectors  underpin,  support
and encourage the promotion of small, medium and micro  entrepreneuring.  It
needs to be noted that the beneficiaries of these grants and  subsidies  for
infrastructural  development  support,  competitiveness  and   manufacturing
promotion should also be women, the youth and  the  disabled.  New  entrants
and women entrepreneurs need to readily access  the  department's  incentive
schemes without difficulty, delay or marginalisation.

The challenge is for us all to take up the department's exciting  incentives
such as the  small  and  medium  manufacturing  enterprises  programme,  the
skills  support  programmes,  industrial  development  zones   and   spatial
development initiatives. It  needs  to  be  mentioned  that  the  Industrial
Development Corporation  will  continue  to  focus  on  empowering  emerging
entrepreneurs and to  support  manufacturing,  tourism,  agroindustries  and
small-scale mining. It will also facilitate regional  development  in  South
Africa. New initiatives include telecommunications, information  technology,
retail and service sectors, government tenders and venture  capital.  It  is
interesting to note that only few women exporters use the  various  products
and services, including financial and technical support. The  export  market
investment assistance scheme could enhance black economic  participation  in
all export sectors.

Technology through Women in Business is  the  Deputy  Minister's  initiative
and I must congratulate her on it. It aims to enhance and empower  women  by
availing instruments of science and technology  to  women  in  business.  It
needs  to  be  said  that  we  need  realistic  output  in  regard  to  this
developmental programme. I do believe that the budgets of all  line-function
departments should be planned in such  a  way  that  their  fiscal  spending
consciously becomes gender-sensitised in their programmes.  I  think  it  is
possible   that   economic   empowerment,   enterprise    development    and
megaindustrial participation - nationally and regionally - can  be  realised
if this takes place.

In conclusion, I would like to say that the rationale  of  effective  fiscal
spending should and must be translated towards realistic and tangible  goals
to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment.

We wish to welcome the department's  efforts  in  trying  to  establish  the
gender programme with a full-time programme manager. However,  it  needs  to
be expressed  that  all  initiatives  must  be  fully  capacitated  so  that
positive and realistic changes in the lives of women can occur. Our  efforts
must ensure that  equitable  access  to  resources,  skills  and  programmes
substantially reduces poverty.

I also want to say that we need to take cognisance of the fact that we  must
address global crises of unsustainability, poverty and  moral  degeneration,
which cannot be dealt with  just  symptomatically  without  addressing  more
fundamental  issues  of   ongoing   processes   constantly   producing   and
reproducing certain patterns of imbalance. We need  to  achieve  equity  and
justice and truly to improve the lives of women. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson and hon Minister, trade and  industry  are  the
heart of our economy. How can the importance of this  sector  be  expressed?
It is the centre of our national and international economic performance.

The MF congratulates the  department  on  its  efforts  at  promoting  South
Africa as a global competitor. However, we have to  look  earnestly  at  the
beating our rand has taken over the past few months, and we cannot  do  that
without raising an eyebrow of concern. Now we have been offered a number  of
reasons for its happening, but the concern is that we do not want a repeat.

We have a strong nation with immense talent and opportunities  to  make  our
mark. We have the potential to be a major global  economic  competitor.  Our
rand has a potential to be a  strong  currency  standing  firm  against  the
dollar and the pound.

The rand issue is, sadly, accompanied by the high rate of unemployment.  The
MF notes the efforts, programmes and projects undertaken by  Government  and
other  role-players  in  creating  jobs.  However,  the  reality   is   that
joblessness is still rife and it lends itself to horrific rates of  poverty.
It has taken into account that the department works hard at  addressing  the
unemployment issue.
The MF is concerned about the advancement  of  small  business  enterprises,
and it is glad  that  the  department  has  introduced  the  enterprise  and
industry development programme to sustain its development. It  is  important
to note the difference in the market's potential to  perform,  according  to
size, quality and many other circumstances. This might  be  too  competitive
for smaller  markets.  It  is  pleasing  to  note  that  the  department  is
committed to instituting a fair, competitive and  efficient  marketplace  in
creating a better life for all citizens of South Africa.

We have  domestic  production  that  could  place  us  at  an  advantage  in
international markets. The department  has  noted  this  potential  via  the
international trade development programme.

The MF supports the Trade and Industry Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, the Department of Trade and Industry  has,
over the past years, put into place facilities that are meant to respond  to
the poor people's needs in business.  This  development,  coupled  with  the
speed with which the department is able  to  register  companies  of  people
from the disadvantaged communities, is indeed commendable.

However, the participation of blacks in business activities is  hampered  by
the  lack  of  financial  support  from   formal   financial   institutions.
Commercial banks, in particular, are happy to receive the poor's  moneys  in
the form of savings and other  types  of  accounts,  but  offer  nothing  in
return. Because commercial banks are still conducting business as usual  for
blacks, Government should tighten its procurement policies  to  force  banks
to deal with the poor favourably.

On another front, the gambling industry, despite regulations that have  been
put in  place,  is  far  from  bringing  about  meaningful  and  broad-based
economic empowerment and transformation.  Ninety  percent  of  gamblers  are
black, particularly in the  horse-racing  industry.  Yet  this  industry  is
still predominantly white-dominated  and  white-controlled.  Surely  blacks,
being 90% of  the  supporters  of  this  industry,  should  by  now  have  a
meaningful stake in it.  To  illustrate  the  point,  Phumelela  Racing  and
Leisure, which controls most of the horse-racing activities, has only  27,5%
for empowerment groups.
The black economic empowerment sphere of the department's activity is  still
not well defined. Only  a  few  blacks  are  enjoying  the  fruits  of  this
empowerment  opening.  Finalisation  of  the  policy  statement,  which  can
provide guidelines on what black economic empowerment is all about, is  what
is needed.

Azapo supports this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Chairperson and hon members, we view the  DTI's  budget  under
three headings: policy, systems and capacity. Policy is the  starting  point
because it expresses, in broad terms, the department's intention in  respect
of outcomes. By systems we mean the processes  and  instruments  within  the
department which are geared towards  implementing  policy.  By  capacity  we
refer to the ability of the institutions concerned to  take  the  policy  in
question through the delivery systems.

There are areas in which the DP feels that  the  department's  policies  and
strategies are inadequate. I want to highlight just  two  areas.  The  first
one is unemployment. The fact that economic growth regularly falls short  of
the targeted 6% growth, coupled  with  our  inability  to  create  jobs,  is
deeply worrying. The second one is  SMME  development.  We  really  need  to
debate this more thoroughly. Policy has to be formulated for the  conditions
under which it will be implemented. For example, what  is  the  Government's
response to Agoa and Nepad?  Agoa  has  huge  policy  implications  for  the
economy.

With regard to systems, the  committee  had  an  opportunity  to  engage  on
budgetary issues with the DTI's associated institutions. These  institutions
throughout  the  2001-02  financial   year   devoted   much   attention   to
restructuring and policy reassessment. To the portfolio committee,  it  grew
increasingly evident that internal  transformation  was  being  used  as  an
important indicator of success rather  than  their  capacity  to  serve  the
business  community  both  equitably  and   efficiently.   One   can   never
restructure to be efficient when one does not have an end-user and  consumer
for one's efficiency.

The idea is simple. For any given line function the  department  prepares  a
strategic  plan  looking  at  outcomes  and  outputs  and  service  delivery
indicators.  The  strategic  plan  fits  directly   into   the   Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework.  Once  again  the  DTI's  performance  is  cause  for
concern in this regard.

With regard to capacity, the first law of empowerment  is  full  employment.
The BEE model as presented to Parliament is deeply flawed. SMME  development
is  being  integrated  with  black  economic  empowerment  and  with   women
entrepreneurs' involvement. It is often assumed  that  SMME  development  is
good  for  BEE  or  vice  versa.  The  reality  is  much  more  problematic.
Capacitating SMMEs is especially important in  creating  the  critical  mass
that drives reform. Until the institutions of capital creation can  be  made
available to the poor, this Government will continue  to  be  frustrated  in
its efforts to encourage institutional capacities that benefit the poor.

A case in point is the National Empowerment Fund, which the DP  views  as  a
vital instrument. Its purpose is to empower the formally disadvantaged  with
venture capital. But the DTI used a once-off investment of R174  million  to
purchase a stake in M-Cell on behalf  of  the  NEF.  It  will  be  allocated
shares from privatised parastatals which it can then sell at a 20%  discount
to previously disadvantaged investors, some of whom are likely to  be  poor.
What precautions are in place to ensure that proceeds from these  sales  are
not exploited by speculators?

Lastly, should the DTI not be looking at such structural  issues  that  keep
people poor and  unemployed  and  focus  its  attention  on  how  to  create
opportunities that enable people to rise out of poverty? [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Mr Chairman, the policy of the DTI on trade and industry  is
based on the presumption of fair competition and a genuine free  market.  It
is assumed that  the  ongoing  liberalisation  of  our  economy  will  yield
efficiency, good returns and the reduction of  poverty.  In  my  view  these
presumptions, whilst they may be true in theory, in practice must be  viewed
with great circumspection.

Are the global markets free? The foremost proponents of  free  markets,  the
US and the EU, are pursuing protectionist  policies  that  are  inimical  to
fair competition and the promotion of free access  by  developing  economies
to the global economy. It is trite, for example, that  the  much  celebrated
success of the Airbus was achieved through direct  or  indirect  undisclosed
huge amounts of financial subsidies.

The US is backtracking from its stated support  for  liberalisation  and  is
betraying the  Doha  agreement  on  the  second  round  of  negotiations  by
imposing restrictions on steel imports, even though they  exempted  us,  and
backing a monstrous form of subsidies in agriculture. The  US  is  making  a
mockery of its stated support for free trade. We must be cautious before  we
fall into the snare of what looks like  free  trade.  There  is  doubt  that
genuine  free  competition  would  bolster  our  economy,  but  the   recent
developments  cast  doubts  on  the  developed  countries'   commitment   to
eradicating poverty. We too must look at tariffs with regard to basic  foods
as a strategic political approach.

Protectionism by the US and EU has not benefited  their  own  economies.  In
Germany unemployment is at its highest, and the US economy is struggling  to
recover  from  recession.  Whilst  not  abandoning  the  objective  of   the
democratisation of multilateral trade institutions and  genuine  free  trade
at global  level,  we  must  not  ignore  the  advantages  of  focusing  our
attention  on  trading  within  the  continent.  We  must  work  to   secure
preferential trade agreements within  the  continent  and  other  developing
economies. We must identify strategic trading partners in the continent  and
work hard to  do  business  with  them.  Ultimately  the  power  to  compete
globally resides in the size of an economy and its competitiveness  and  not
so much in the  ability  to  raise  moral  issues.  We  must  promote  rural
agriculture. KZN and the Eastern Cape, for  example,  can  feed  the  entire
country and the region if policies are properly determined.

Looking at the local challenges, the DTI  has  restructured  various  units.
Whilst I support this, it is my submission  that  the  tempo  is  too  slow.
Unemployment is rising and  our  people  can  no  longer  wait  for  service
delivery. The role of Ntsika and Khula in the development of small  business
is very urgent. Microlenders are unable to  help  small  businesses  because
lending capital is too costly, we are told. Neither are  big  banks  helping
small business as they should because they consider the sector  as  infested
with high risks. Therefore only the DTI can help the  development  of  small
business.

Although the underspending by the DTI is  comparatively  low,  it  is  still
unacceptable in the face of huge demands by this sector. Another issue  that
the DTI must address in our country to promote  black  economic  empowerment
is educating our people on the need  for  savings  and  investment.  At  the
moment there is no such culture.

We support the Vote as the ACDP, although we are still concerned  about  the
issue of gambling. [Applause.]

Ms C  C  SEPTEMBER:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  Erwin,  comrades  and  hon
members, please allow me  also  some  time  to  wish  the  Deputy  Minister,
Comrade Lindiwe Hendricks, a speedy recovery on behalf of the committee  and
express the hope that she will be back in the department and  in  Parliament
soon.

In his address to the  opening  of  Parliament  on  8  February  this  year,
President Thabo Mbeki drew our and South  Africa's  attention  to  important
matters requiring urgent attention. One, of course,  was  on  the  issue  of
microreform. The President informed us in his speech that  Government  would
continue to work on  reducing  the  level  of  poverty  and  developing  our
greatest resource, namely our people. Government would improve  the  quality
of life of all our people, put this country  on  higher  rates  of  economic
growth, improve the efficiency of Government and of course involve  as  many
of our people as possible in  what  is  called  the  people's  campaign,  or
Vukuzenzele.

It is my view that all of us have learned from our  mistakes  in  the  past,
and  it  is  encouraging  to  see  that  attempts  are  being  made  towards
sustainable  economic  development.  The  move  from  macroeconomic  towards
microeconomic reform is aimed at the alleviation of the  poverty  trap  that
underpins our economy. It sets some  guidelines  as  to  what  citizens  can
expect  from  Government  and  from  the  DTI  and  in  particular   towards
sustainable development for the majority of  the  people  in  this  country.
These guidelines set the platform on which to build  a  collective  approach
towards employment creation, equity growth  and  the  necessary  support  of
microeconomic reform measures that should be put into place. This  platform,
however, should be free of constraints on economic growth.

Our challenge in South Africa remains to overcome the  legacy  of  the  past
and find creative ways of breaking the syndrome of what I will refer  to  as
the Irish coffee situation in the economy. The  Irish  coffee  situation  is
one where all the white is on top, with that lovely  little  bit  of  cream,
and the vast majority of the blackness is at  the  bottom  of  the  cup.  We
think people must enjoy Irish coffee in restaurants and not see  it  in  the
South African economy any more. We must alleviate and eradicate poverty.

Allow me to give some illustration of this and a present case study that  we
have done in Mitchells Plain on urban renewal. Here we  want  to  illustrate
how we can bring about microreform in this area. As members  know,  or  some
know, Mitchells Plain is located in  the  Cape  Flats  on  the  southeastern
False Bay Coast. The area falls within the broader False Bay  Coastal  Park.
The effective development and management of the coastal park is  significant
in creating direct economic opportunities and  also  indirect  opportunities
relating to tourism and informal training. This will  necessitate  the  need
to improve connectivity -  connectivity  which  will  improve  the  market's
ability and the ability in that area.

The area is situated on the Cape Flats aquifer,  which  is  a  future  water
source of metropolitan significance. The surviving dunes in  this  area  and
the landscape within the urban area  provide  topographical  relief  to  the
flat landscape we have  there.  The  area  falls  within  a  very  important
coastal plain - a plain which is poorly connected, but is part of the  area.
Part of the area is also  connected  and  located  at  what  is  called  the
Wolfgat Nature Reserve. All  of  this  forms  part  of  the  very  important
broader False Bay Coastal Park.

Why do we need microeconomic reform in such an area and Mitchells  Plain  in
particular? This area has over a million people  squeezed  into  it  due  to
apartheid policies. In that area the highest education level  of  about  80%
of the adult population is below matric. Coupled to that, one finds  in  the
same area, a high rate of teenage pregnancy. We are all well  aware  of  the
socioeconomic ills and the gangsterism in this area.

However, what is lacking in this area in order to take it out of  that  trap
is the following: First of all, it does not have any local industrial  base.
The people that stay in the area need to commute  very  long  distances  for
employment  opportunities.  The  closest   places   where   one   can   find
opportunities for work are Epping, Capricorn Park,  and  Airport  Industria.
Many have, of course, moved much further than that.

Secondly, it has an inappropriate concentration of  business  opportunities,
with most of them squeezed into what is called the  Town  Centre,  a  centre
which is bursting at its seams with informal trading and poses a  real  fire
risk more than anything else.

Economic development in this area is concentrated  in  Lentegeur,  the  Town
Centre, as I said, Westgate Mall and the Westridge and Rocklands area.  With
regard to opportunities, as one looks around, the  area  next  to  the  Town
Centre, where there are vast tracts of open land, is quite a case  in  point
if we want to talk about local reform.

Thirdly, the coastal resorts that  we  have  in  this  area  are  completely
underutilised and have no institutional structures to steer the creation  of
a False Bay Coastal Park. The abundant open space is, of course,  costly  to
maintain, and this has created a breeding ground for criminal  activity.  It
is, of course, threatened by the dumping in these areas. What one  finds  in
Tafelsig today is an increased number of backyard shacks and squatting.

Unfortunately, the DA responded to all the challenges in  these  areas  with
what they call  a  Cape  Renewal  Plan,  which  involves  the  painting  and
cleaning of graffiti by gangsters  on  the  walls  in  the  area.  It  is  a
completely unscientific plan which is more geared to  the  planes  that  fly
over Mitchells Plain, which will see that there are no  more  gangs  in  the
area. It has not addressed the real issues. It is a typical  response  of  a
party that does not care  about  how  one  changes  at  a  local  level  the
economic situation of people in the area. We can only  call  on  the  DA  to
rather leave the brushes with which they are painting  the  walls  and  find
some creative areas for new economic opportunities for  the  people  in  the
area. [Interjections.]

We need to understand how industrial policy  works.  Our  challenge  remains
that of how to extend a growth strategy to encompass  the  people  in  these
areas and townships. It is not worthwhile responding to the  hon  Ellis.  As
the ANC, we need to end the  dual  society  that  we  have  in  places  like
Mitchells Plain, a typical Irish coffee kind  of  a  situation,  an  economy
with high poverty, unemployment and a lack of economic advancement.

How do we link macroeconomic  policy  with  the  microeconomy  of  Mitchells
Plain? We trust that this budget will assist us in extending the  notion  of
job creation in Mitchells Plain, Mdantsane,  KwaMashu,  Uitenhage,  Phoenix,
Galeshewe  and  Pokwane  to  the  natural  collectives  that  exist  in  our
townships, a plus to us  as  the  ANC.  We  think  that  we  must  tap  this
collective spirit  into  our  townships.  If  we  mobilise  this  collective
spirit, this community togetherness, for  the  economy,  we  will  not  talk
about solitary traders selling cigarettes  all  over  the  place  in  little
corners.

I would like the comrade  Minister  to  note  that  we  can  mobilise  these
communities and give them resources to  develop  an  industrial  policy  for
these local areas like  Mitchells  Plain  and  others  and  the  many  other
destitute communities which the banks, of course, see as  risk  areas.  They
require skills and  management  training  so  that  they  can  put  together
business plans. When we develop in these areas it  is  best  to  develop  in
order to expand productive activity and not just  merely  cigarette  trading
activity that will not add any value.

This direction that we will  take  will  give  true  meaning  to  the  ANC's
slogan, ``Make it happen where we live.'' Make  it  happen  where  we  live,
where people can have skills to build roads, to have appropriate  technology
for their small businesses, where there can be refuse removals, where  there
can be many more repair  shops,  etc,  where  supply-side  measures  can  be
directed and redirected in meaningful micro  form  to  activities  in  these
areas.

In essence, ICT, technology in general, innovation  and  knowledge-intensive
services should be aimed at the current basic needs.  In  this  we  are  not
implying that we should not export. In  fact,  we  are  saying  that  export
should take place but that the  budget  should  reflect  a  balance  between
priorities: for example, between the growth in ICT and the retention of  job
sectors.

Furthermore, there should  be  a  synergy  between  the  framework  and  the
understanding  of  South  African  industrial  development.  The  industrial
policy  requires  of  the  DTI  to  pay  particular  attention  to  sectoral
development, in terms of both competition and collective  action,  which  we
have  already  put  together  through  full   consultations   with   labour,
Government, business and, of course, civil society  at  Nedlac.  We  welcome
the process as a committee that  has  started  with  the  Presidential  Jobs
Summit sectors, the coming WSSD and, of course, the coming growth summit.

We would like to improve, as said earlier, the position of women and of  the
rural poor, enhance growth throughout the Southern African region and in  so
doing break the cycle of poverty that we have around us. We welcome  further
engagement and initiatives in the department. We trust that we will have  no
more Irish coffee situation in our country but will rather be able  to  make
it happen where we live.

Let me return very quickly to the hate speeches that were  made  by  certain
members. I think it is appropriate, as some  of  the  members  have  already
said, that we understand why the DP behaves as  it  does.  Interestingly,  a
member of the DP says that the poor are increasing, and then starts  talking
about the  dollar  that  will  cost  R20.  We  must  understand  why  he  is
interested in the dollar going up. It is because his  constituency  is  more
in Britain than it is in South Africa. [Applause.]

On the other hand, he says that the solution in  overcoming  poverty  is  to
reduce the cost of business. He says nothing about how to reduce poverty  in
the area. It is very interesting to see that the two of them really seem  to
be talking from opposite sides. Of course, one  cannot  blame  the  one  who
sleeps in meetings more than  anything  else  and  does  not  have  anything
positive to say.

Maybe we should tell Mr Nigel Bruce what Vladimir Lenin  can  offer  him  in
this area. But, of course, he would be so shocked to hear  what  Lenin  said
to him that I do not think it would be worthwhile educating  him  here.  Let
me  rather  ask  him  to  try  to  find  a  better  way  to  represent   his
constituency, Britain.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member,  before  you  leave
the podium let me deal with your reference  to  ``hate  speech''.  In  South
Africa ``hate speech'' has  a  particular  context.  I  think  it  would  be
inappropriate to consider that a  statement  made  in  the  House  could  be
construed as hate speech.

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: I withdraw that, Chairperson. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  as  I  call  upon
the hon the Minister of Trade and Industry I would like to  commend  to  you
the display of the DTI in the Old Assembly. I think you should not miss  the
opportunity of seeing what the DTI has to show you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, I thank you  for  the  wise
comments which you have just made.

Chairperson, colleagues in the House, I would like to  thank  those  parties
that have supported our vote and I also  want  to   particularly  thank  the
speakers for the serious way in which they have gone about their remarks.  I
believe the economy is crucial to all of us. It is not  the  property  of  a
political party or Government. It is the very lifeblood  of  our  existence,
and we should treat it seriously.

It is for this reason that I am somewhat bemused that the  comments  from  a
major opposition party are really so unthought-out and merely reflective  of
cliches and dogma from the past. This does not really help and, I think,  it
merely earns  disrespect  for  the  party  whose  spokesperson  makes  those
points.

Let me comment on some of the matters raised. We take the  advice,  insights
and comments made by many members, but I would like to use this occasion  to
make a few further remarks. I think that the question of the growth  summit,
relating to what the hon Bekker said, is not a question of  differences  but
a question of practicalities. We  are  looking  to  make  this  a  practical
summit, one where people will have a chance to reflect. We  want  people  to
come to that summit with a clear understanding of what it is that  they  can
do and what the commitments can be in doing  that.  For  practical  purposes
this summit would only take place towards the end  of  this  year.  I  think
this is something to which we should all contribute and work towards.

Let me also indicate  that,  from  Government's  point  of  view,  we  fully
support the Minister of Home Affairs in his objective of  ensuring  that  we
have skills in this economy. My department and his have worked together  and
will continue to work together. We  are  very  conscious  of  the  need  for
skills and we will ensure that the economy gets those required skills,  both
through our internal training and by bringing in skills from outside,  which
is an unavoidable requirement for this economy.

I wish to quickly indicate that with  regard  to  small  business,  and  the
comments made by the hon Redcliffe, I think it is  correct  that  there  are
duplications at times and we would accept that. But I would not  think  that
the multiplicity of service providers is a bad thing. I think it is  a  good
thing. We may from time to time want  to  check  on  the  quality  of  those
providers.

But, again, I would draw his attention to some of the documentation that  we
have made available to him. I would suggest that he  look  at  the  pamphlet
that comes from the  Brain  website  and  from  the  Manufacturing  Advisory
Council and also, increasingly, start using the  call  centre  and  customer
care centre that we have put up. There is a wealth of  advice  and  I  think
that is good for small business.

I would like to thank the hon member Lockey for his very thoughtful  inputs.
On the skills shortage, I think we should  bear  in  mind  that  this  is  a
structural problem, but it is not an insurmountable problem.  What  we  have
been able to do, in the case of many  particular  investments,  is  to  work
with the local educational institutions to bring about a rapid  increase  of
skills. The new Immigration Bill specifically allows for corporate  permits,
which will help us in that respect  as  well,  to  bring  skills  in  behind
investments. So in the short term we can certainly do many things.

Let me make a comment about the National Empowerment Fund.  Basically,  this
fund has not as yet had those assets that come  from  the  restructuring  of
state assets put into that fund. This is in large measure because  it  seems
from our discussions with Treasury, and from the hon member's own  comments,
that we may well need to adjust some  of  the  emphasis  and  focus  of  the
empowerment fund. We are currently working to modify  the  proposals  around
the National Empowerment Fund. I am  confident  that  these  proposals  will
lead to a much more effective and very important  institution  unfolding  in
the coming months around the National Empowerment Fund.

I will just indicate that with the industrial development  zones  these  are
not delays. The IDZs are thoroughly canvassed and very  closely  looked  at.
We comply with environmental management legislation and  we  demand  of  all
levels of government that are associated with the IDZs that they give  us  a
clear commitment to what  they  will  do.  We  scrutinise  the  applications
carefully. A tremendous amount of work goes into them  and  I  would  rather
err on the side of caution, so that we get the thing thoroughly  done,  than
rush matters just for the sake of my looking good as the Minister  declaring
IDZs. Our job is to create a good service in the IDZ, not to  make  the  DTI
look good.

The hon member raised issues  about  our  trade  practices  in  the  customs
union. I would be very keen  to  hear  those.  I  think  that  South  Africa
conducts itself very well in trade, particularly with  our  neighbours,  and
as far as we can with the customs union. I am very pleased to  say  that  we
have reached an agreement with our partners in the customs union. I  believe
that it is the most advanced form of  economic  integration  in  Africa  and
that it may well become a role model. We are very excited and  very  pleased
about  it.  It  is  probably  the  first  time  in  Africa  that   a   truly
supranational body will deal with certain matters. In the new customs  union
agreement it will be the customs union that deals with tariff  setting  and,
I think, that is a great step forward for all of us in the region.

I respect the views of the ACDP and the hon member Dudley on gambling.  This
is her right and I respect  those  views.  I  would  say  to  her  that,  as
Government, we are concerned about regulating this industry in the  tightest
manner possible. I have, just a matter of days ago, consulted  with  all  my
colleagues in the provinces and the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal and asked  them
to consider certain important amendments that we feel we should make to  the
Act. I am very hopeful that the hon member's influence will  be  brought  to
bear and that my colleagues in the provinces will accept this  proposal.  It
is imperative that we do regulate the industry more effectively.

However, for those of us who are more human and less pure than the ACDP  and
do gamble, I want to draw to their attention that I think  the  lottery  has
been  a  success.  We  distributed  R200  million,  which  is  the   largest
distribution for good cause that has ever been achieved in this country.  In
the coming year we will distribute far more. [Applause.]

We certainly can make an impact on the wellbeing of our people  through  the
fallibilities of humanity. So I am a bit torn between the  two  hon  members
as to whether we should or should not  continue  with  gambling  because  it
does give us some good-cause money. But I think the reality is  that  people
like myself are fallible and we do gamble. I never gamble  in  South  Africa
as the Minister in charge. [Laughter.]
Let me just indicate to my comrade from the PAC that  our  legislation  does
not favour foreign investors over South African investors. This is  a  wrong
perception. It is not correct, and it is really a slight  on  South  African
business leaders, particularly black business leaders, to suggest that  they
are not capable of dealing with foreign  competition.  They  most  certainly
are and the dominant force in the South African  economy  is  South  African
businesspeople.

With regard to women, we are very pleased that this  has  been  highlighted.
One point that no one  mentioned,  which  I  would  like  to  bring  to  all
members' attention, is the South African Women's  Entrepreneur  Network.  We
had hoped to launch it last month and we will launch it in June.  It  is  an
exciting  initiative.  It  will  be  facilitated  by  the  DTI.  The  Deputy
Minister, hon Hendricks, has been very much a driving  force  there,  and  I
was very reluctant to launch it in her absence. [Applause.]

I personally believe that South African women  have  shown  time  and  again
that they are very important components of  the  South  African  economy.  I
have no problems about the vitality, the drive and the initiative of  women.
The points the hon member makes about giving them access to  information  on
finance are correct. But what we are actually seeing in practice - there  is
no question about this  -  is  that  the  dominant  leadership  of  the  new
enterprises is logically from women.

The  second  speaker  from  the  DP  spoke  about  the  African  Growth  and
Opportunity Act. We are doing a lot in terms of Agoa and  South  Africa  has
been very successful.

I would agree with the hon member  September  that  there  seem  to  be  two
different DPs when it comes to supporting black economic empowerment.

It was suggested by the ACDP that our assumption is a free- market one,  and
that is not correct. I think we are more realistic than that.

My congratulations to  the  hon  Corrie  September.  This  is  the  kind  of
approach that we must all take. Each one of us in this  House  should  be  a
leader in our  local  economies.  If  one  is  not,  one  is  failing  one's
constituency. Really, one can do it and, there is much more cause  for  hope
than there is for depression. There is tremendous hope  out  there  that  we
can get things moving. The new DTI that we are trying  to  build  will  help
members as much  as  we  possibly  can.  But  every  area  has  an  economic
possibility. We must break from this depressing mind-set that everything  is
wrong and we cannot do anything.  We  can  do  tremendous  amounts  and  the
people that we brought here today, the people  that  we  are  working  with,
have shown time and again that South Africa will succeed.

My last point is that I would like to draw to the attention  of  this  House
that there has been concern about the plastic industry. This  is  completely
unwarranted. We really must stop this kind of scare  tactic.  I  am  working
very closely with my colleague the Minister  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism and we will draw up specifications. There is  no  question  that  we
are going to try to destroy this industry.

What we will do is to put in place a very good provision to  regulate  these
plastic bags. We will put in a  revenue-raising  mechanism  to  bring  about
programmes to collect the bags and we will bring in  programmes  to  recycle
them. There are no disasters looming here. We must stop this  nonsense  that
in order to make short-term points  we  keep  preaching  disasters  in  this
economy. This economy is not a disaster. It is a great success.  [Applause.]


Debate concluded.

                               POINT OF ORDER

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now need to  make  a  ruling.
On Wednesday, 8 May 2002, the hon Mr J J Dowry raised a point  of  order  in
regard to a notice of motion given by the hon Mr A J Botha. Mr  Dowry  asked
whether it was parliamentary for a member to say that, and I want to  quote:
``Other members of the House are being bribed to serve in certain posts''  -
quoted as translated.

I said then that I would rule on the matter after I  had  checked  what  was
said in the notice of motion. I have now had the opportunity  to  study  the
notice of motion and wish to rule on the matter.

The words Mr Botha used, and I quote as translated: ``... to  bribe  elected
public  representatives  to  betray  their  constitutional  undertaking  for
personal gain'', must, in the context of the notice of motion, refer to  the
New NP members of Parliament as referred to in the same  notice  of  motion.
This is an unacceptable attack on  such  members'  integrity,  and  I  must,
therefore, ask the hon Mr Botha to withdraw those remarks.

Mr A J BOTHA: Chairperson, I withdraw the remarks. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! As  the  unparliamentary
remark renders  the  notice  of  motion  out  of  order,  on  the  Speaker's
authority, the said notice of motion  will  not  be  printed  on  the  Order
Paper. [Applause.]

                 LAND AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  let  me
illustrate the Land Bank and its activities practically. On Saturday  I  was
in a place called Groot Marico, where Herman Charles Bosman used to go as  a
teacher and where Oom Schalk Lourens used to live. It is far  away,  in  the
North West province.

A certain group from the Bafokeng people received restitution of  land  that
they were driven away from in 1935. It is a huge project, this  restitution.
The land loan was somewhat over R7 million, for the land to be bought  back.
The whole Government  package  was  about  R11  million,  in  terms  of  the
restitution. We were there and the people were joyful. And then I  saw  this
white guy walking around in khaki clothing. I was wondering, since he  stuck
out like a sore thumb, what he was doing there. So I went up to him. When  I
came closer I saw all kinds of small insignia on  his  clothes.  On  looking
closer - I cannot see very well - I saw he was from the Land Bank, and  that
he was Mr Leon Steenwert, and he was walking there among the people.

Half of those people have not worked for many years,  they  are  unemployed.
Now they are getting their land restored.  So  I  started  looking  for  the
representatives of the other  banks,  the  man  from  Absa,  the  lady  from
Standard and the man from First National, and none was to be found.

So I was thinking that a land bank is  a  good  thing.  No  other  financial
institution will go down there except the Land Bank. That is  what  we  have
in the Land Bank, an institution that does not cost the taxpayer a cent.  It
is actually funded by its commercial activities  in  agriculture.  In  other
words, any farmer who is paying back a loan to the Land Bank  can  say  with
pride, ``I am paying back my Land Bank loan. I am  assisting  in  empowering
the developing sector in  agriculture.  I  am  assisting  with  land  reform
because the interest I pay will be used for this purpose''.

Now this new Land  and  Agricultural  Development  Bank  Bill  that  we  are
bringing here is actually the  result  of  intensifying  and  extending  the
developing functions of the Land  Bank.  It  actually  comes  as  a  result,
partly, of what the Strauss commission, some few  years  back,  recommended,
that the Land Bank continue to provide access  to  its  existing  clientele,
but with its main focus being the new development finance system. It  should
include financial support to new clients, especially  the  beneficiaries  of
land reform programmes.

Furthermore, the Land Bank's wholesale  function  must  be  fostering  rural
financial institutions, and we hope that the  village  banks  are  going  to
grow stronger with assistance from  this  wholesale  function  of  the  Land
Bank.

However, this is something not very popular. We have some resistance to  the
preferential treatment that the bank provides because, it  is  argued,  this
makes the bank unequal before the law. Now  I  want  to  say  that  we  have
corrected what the Constitutional Court asked us to do, and that had  mainly
to do with two sections of the old Land Bank Act. According to the old  Act,
there was a provision that the Land Bank did not  need  to  use  the  normal
courts when it went to court to demand payment of loans  owed  to  it.  That
has now been corrected.

But what we need  to  know  is  that  the  Constitutional  Court  was  quite
explicit, in the person of Judge Mokgoro,  who  said  that  she  agreed  and
accepted that the preference given to the Land Bank was  an  important  form
of security in the absence of contractual security  between  the  Land  Bank
and its debtor clients. She said, and I quote, ``that  the  instant  removal
of such security would prejudice the bank''. In other words, the court  held
that it was reasonable that the statutory security should  not  be  removed.
Its present forms of security should be preserved.

We do have some opposition from the Banking  Council  and  from  the  banks,
which took us to court on those matters, on the grounds that the  provisions
of the Land  and  Agricultural  Development  Bank  Bill  should  not  be  in
conflict with the provision for equality before  the  law.  I  am  convinced
that the Bill as presented before this House does not exceed the  parameters
of the standards laid down in the Bill  of  Rights  and  especially  in  the
limitations clause in section 36.

The equality clause demands equal treatment of all, but  that  is  based  on
the argument that the Land Bank and other banking  institutions  are  equal.
Our submission is that they are not. The Land Bank has a different role.  It
is not the same as other banks in a lot of instances. For example, it has  a
development role, in terms of which it may enter into high-risk  operations,
lending to the developmental sector.

It must assist in land reform programmes, and it is doing that. We  hope  to
intensify, with this new Bill, the developmental  activities  of  the  bank.
What  is  wrong  with  subsidising  small  and  emerging  farmers  from  the
commercial sector of farming? What is wrong with that in principle? Some  of
the banks say no, Parliament must fund  these  developmental  functions.  We
must tax the people of this country to  assist  emerging  farmers.  That  is
what we should do, and the Land Bank should stay out of  commercial  farming
operations, because that is where the commercial banks  should  be  able  to
pick the cherries, to get the good clients only, those  which  are  not  any
risk at all.

What we are doing is not wrong. Some  people  argue  that,  no,  one  should
strictly separate the commercial  activities  of  the  Land  Bank  from  the
developmental activities, and Parliament must then  fund  the  developmental
activities, and not the commercial activities. I think since 1912, the  Land
Bank has played a major role in the  development  of  agriculture  in  South
Africa. It has produced this strong  commercial  agricultural  sector.  This
would not have been possible without  the  developmental  functions  of  the
Land Bank all these years.

We are saying the Land Bank cannot withdraw from development  now;  it  must
be strengthened. We need more development functions of the  Land  Bank.  The
point is that no other bank  is  exposed  to  the  developmental  sector  of
agriculture; no other bank is doing that. They were not walking in the  veld
in Groot Marico near Pela, where we were on Saturday. They were  not  there.
No one else will do this; only the Land Bank will do this  and  it  must  do
more of it.

Some people have argued  that  when  the  Land  Bank  concentrates  only  on
development work, it leaves  all  the  strong  interest-generating  work  to
commercial financial institutions. My submission  is  that  those  arguments
are not based on constitutional  reasoning,  nor  on  developing  reasoning.
Those arguments seek to eliminate the Land Bank as a competitor,  to  reduce
the bank to an institution which offers grounds to recipients  depending  on
the generosity of Parliament and funded by the taxpayer.  We  cannot  accept
that position.

This is an institution that has proven itself over the  years.  This  is  an
institution that still has a future  of  great  significance  in  developing
this extremely important sector of agriculture, and we are  going  to  stand
firm. We are not going to let this powerful institution dissipate.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  Minister,  your  time  is
about to expire.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: I will end. We know that, for example,  in  housing  we
have now instituted policies which will  compel  financial  institutions  to
set aside a prescribed portion of home loan funding  for  middle-  and  low-
income households. In agriculture we do not need it; we have  got  the  Land
Bank. [Applause.]

Mr N H MASITHELA: Chairperson, as I was walking to this podium, I  was  told
that I have been given five minutes extra, on top of the 15 minutes I  have,
so I must use it profitably.

Chairperson, the Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa, commonly  known
as the Land Bank, was established by the Land Bank Act  of  1912.  This  Act
was repeatedly repealed and eventually replaced by  the  present  Land  Bank
Act of 1944. Beyond any reasonable doubt this Act  is  outdated,  especially
to meet the challenges of this day and age.

Also, the recommendations of the Strauss Commission identified the need  for
the Land Bank to continue with its primary  focus  on  agriculture,  and  to
broaden considerably its role as agent of the Department of Agriculture  and
Land Affairs.

Substantial transformation also needed to take place in  the  structures  of
the bank, for it to be in line with the challenges and needs of  today.  The
transformation of  the  bank  as  a  development  financial  institution  is
ongoing.

The need therefore existed for an Act to adequately  provide  for  the  role
the bank needs to play in the development of the  country,  as  well  as  to
enable support of Government  programmes  concerned  with  land  reform  and
agrarian development in agriculture, including, amongst  other  things,  the
complete eradication of inequalities.

This Bill will enable the Land Bank to  be  supportive  and  to  collaborate
with other  financial  institutions,  rather  than  to  be  competitive  and
hostile to them. The Bank will  increase  access  to  and  participation  in
agriculture, enhance profitability and  competitiveness,  and  also  improve
sustainability in the agricultural sector.  This  Bill  therefore  seeks  to
push further the frontiers of poverty and  move  closer  to  liberating  the
agricultural communities from the scourge of poverty and underdevelopment.

It is because of the above stated facts that the  Constitutional  Court,  in
the matter between the First National Bank of South Africa versus  the  Land
and Agricultural Bank of South Africa, in 2000, held that certain  parts  of
the Land Bank Act of 1944  were  unconstitutional,  and  the  invalidity  of
certain parts of the Act were suspended for a period of two years.

Part of this Parliament's and Government's responsibility is to comply  with
and respect  decisions  of  the  courts.  We  conceded  and  worked  towards
rectifying whatever was seen not to be in line with the Constitution.

In his state of the nation address in February 2002, the hon  the  President
stated:


  Decision-makers across the globe  have  accepted  the  reality  that  the
  global struggle to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment is  fundamental
  to the wellbeing of human society.

The same reality was repeatedly reiterated by the Minister  of  Finance,  Mr
Trevor Manuel, in his Budget Speech.

With the passage of this Bill,  this  House  will  be  confirming  what  the
President said. This Bill will make  development  a  way  of  life  for  our
people as it will develop emerging farmers and rural entrepreneurs who  have
traditionally been denied  access  to  credit,  while  striving  to  be  the
leading  provider  of  world-class  agricultural   financial   services   by
incorporating a development mindset within its business practices.

We hope that the bank will definitely assist the  aforementioned  categories
of our people to lift from their shoulders  a  portion  of  the  intolerable
burden of poverty and underdevelopment often referred to by the President.

In anticipation of the passage of this  Bill,  the  Land  Bank  has  already
shown commitment to the development of emerging farmers,  by  putting  aside
R200 000 for the training of extension officers in  Bethlehem,  Bloemfontein
and  Kroonstad.  These  officers  will  provide  quality  advice  to   well-
established farmers and emerging farmers in particular.
In Bethlehem, the bank has already had a  success  story,  of  Mr  Cindi,  a
father of four, who did not see himself doing anything else but farming,  if
only there were a person or institution which would show  enough  confidence
in him by lending him money. With other financial  or  lending  institutions
not willing to lend money to people with no collateral  or  security,  there
was no way that he could see a realisation of his life-long dream.

We must take cognisance of the fact  that  during  the  wide  and  extensive
discussions  and  consultations  which  were  conducted  by  the   portfolio
committee, one of the stakeholders, namely, the Banking Council,  failed  to
convince the committee that commercial banks are willing  to  fund  emerging
farmers and entrepreneurs who have no collateral or security. But  the  Land
Bank extended to Mr Cindi a loan which he started  from  a  basic  level  of
R250, and for which he saved and established a  good  financial  record  for
himself. He has now used R18 000 as his present closing balance in the Step-
up Programme. This is payment for the plot which he has purchased  to  start
his farming business. Mr Cindi is now the proud owner of seven cows and  has
his eyes set on becoming a commercial farmer.  He  also  created  employment
for people in the area. The Bill, therefore, in a way, gives  the  bank  the
exclusive right of funding of any agricultural project or aspect.

It will also be noted that a major objective of the Bill is to  balance  the
inequalities  of  the  past  in  so  far  as  inequality  in  ownership   of
agricultural land,  land  distribution  or  even  economic  development  and
development amongst the historically disadvantaged  persons  are  concerned.
It is also essential for us to concede that it is important for  our  people
to benefit out of this development.

This Parliament and Government, particularly, undertook to provide a  better
life for all our people. The passage of this Bill will do  exactly  what  we
said regarding especially previously disadvantaged  communities.  Clause  3,
therefore,  also  introduces  the  focus  on  agrarian   reform   and   land
redistribution, equitable ownership of land, food  security  and  access  to
land both for agricultural purposes and for entrepreneurs.

Clauses 26 and 31 of the Bill list the functions and activities of the  bank
and also stipulate some of the areas of the operation of  the  bank.  Clause
31, especially, highlights examples of the projects and equipment for  which
the loans or funding could be acquired. Amongst many other issues, it  deals
with equipment and the establishment of dams. But the  list  should  not  be
seen as an exhaustive one. It should not be in the minds of the  members  of
the board that this list is exhaustive  and  that,  therefore,  anybody  who
wants to get funding for any other agricultural development  issue  that  is
not listed cannot be funded. I think that the board should  be  prepared  to
fund those particular issues.

On the other hand, clause 38, inter alia, enables the  bank  to  act  as  an
agent for development. This could be for  purposes  of  distributing  relief
money in the case of floods or other disaster relief.  Given  the  expertise
and resources at the bank's disposal, it is also  empowered  to  act  as  an
adviser to Government. The bank's board of directors should  ensure  that  a
comprehensive public relations strategy is formulated and implemented  which
will ensure that all  activities  and  services  offered  by  the  bank  are
communicated to all and sundry and benefit our communities so that ...

... Mme Mma Mofokeng ya maane Bethlehem, a tsebe hore  ha  ba  hlabolla  tsa
bolemirui, o tla kgona ho fumana seo a se hlokang. [...  Mrs  Mofokeng,  who
is a resident of Bethlehem, should know that whenever she wants  to  develop
agriculture, she will be able to acquire whatever she needs.]

The bank, as a development arm of  Government,  should  assist  in  ensuring
that  its  loanees  also  promote  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  their
employees, more especially in the rural areas.  The  passage  of  this  Bill
will undoubtedly be one of the major key delivery mechanisms of  the  social
upliftment of our people. It will also sustain the economic  development  of
our commercial farmers and therefore the bank will indirectly contribute  to
the social responsibility of Government and the people. Farmers,  therefore,
will now cease allowing farmworkers  to  live  in  appalling  conditions  on
their farms. The bank is now also going to be seen to be playing  a  pivotal
role in uplifting the agricultural economy of our  country,  which  in  turn
will contribute to the overall economy of our country.

The portfolio committee was very pleased with the  contributions  that  were
made by different stakeholders. Generally, almost all of them applauded  the
Bill as a step in the  right  direction.  We  must,  however,  also  express
gratitude for the contributions and efforts that were  made  by  members  of
the board and the departments in ensuring that the committee takes steps  to
move ahead towards the passage of this Bill.

The National African Farmers' Union commended the Bill and said that if  the
Bill were not passed, that would bring negative  consequences  for  emerging
farmers, whilst the village  banks  said  that  the  Bill  would  definitely
assist in the growth of the economy of our country and also assist in  their
development as banks. If we delay the passage of this Bill,  it  will  cause
dire strains for their development.

I would also want to thank my predecessor, Comrade Chief Patekile  Holomisa.
He played a pivotal role towards the passage of this Bill by  ensuring  that
this committee was going in the right direction. [Applause.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the Land Bank has played a  very  important
role in the development of agriculture in South Africa. It financed  farmers
and agricultural co-operatives throughout the good and difficult  years.  It
also established the very important principle in financing agriculture:  The
bank used 80% of the productive value of a farm or agricultural industry  as
collateral and not the market value of the farm or industry as the  base  to
secure a loan. According  to  the  Bill,  this  sound  principle  is  to  be
continued and should not be deviated from to finance primary, secondary  and
commercial agriculture.

The other function of the Land Bank, according to the Bill,  is  to  finance
developing agriculture and supply money  to  the  new  small  and  part-time
farmers who do not have  the  collateral  in  the  form  of  an  established
productive value for their enterprise in the making. This is where the  Land
Bank capital will be at risk, and it is where the function of the Land  Bank
will be tested severely.

Die sukses  van  die  Landbank  sal  ook  bepaal  word,  indien  daar  sterk
betrokkenheid bly by die finansiering  van  kommersiële  landbou,  waar  die
nodige fondse gegenereer sal word om die ontwikkelingslandbou te  finansier.
Nuwe toetreders tot die landbou sal nie maklik 'n sukses maak, as  daar  nie
voldoende goedkoop ontwikkelingskapitaal vir hulle beskikbaar is nie.  Sulke
fondse kan alleen kom, indien die staat voldoende fondse beskikbaar stel  in
dié  verband.  Een  swakheid  is  dat  fondse  vir  ontwikkelingslandbou  en
kommersiële landbou nie afsonderlik gehou word nie.

Ten opsigte van droogtehulp aan die landbou wil ek  graag  by  die  Minister
verneem of die fasiliteit steeds by die Landbank beskikbaar sal wees om,  in
oorleg met die Minister van Finansies, geld wat in die  landbou  verdien  is
in goeie jare, vir die Landbank en ander banke te kan belê en  eers  in  die
jaar  van  opvraag  belas  kan  word.  Sekerheid  oor   hierdie   aspek   is
noodsaaklik.  Ons  staan  weer   voor   'n   El   Niño-siklus   van   ongure
weersomstandighede en  indien  veeboere  hulle  vee  moet  verkoop,  om  die
droogte  te  oorleef,  behoort  die  staat  by  gebrek   aan   enige   ander
droogtemaatreëls in hierdie stadium hierdie fasiliteit aan boere  beskikbaar
te stel. Dit behoort vir alle boere te geld. [Tyd  verstreke.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The success of  the  Land  Bank  will  also  be  established  if  a  strong
involvement remains in the financing of commercial  agriculture,  where  the
necessary funds will be generated to finance developmental agriculture.  New
entrants to agriculture will not easily be  successful  if  sufficient  low-
cost development capital is not made available to them. Such funds can  only
be generated if the state makes sufficient funds available in  this  regard.
One weakness is that funds  for  developmental  agriculture  and  commercial
agriculture are not kept separately.

With regard to drought relief to agriculture I would like to know  from  the
hon the Minister whether the facility will still be available from the  Land
Bank of, in consultation with the  Minister  of  Finance,  investing  money,
which was earned in agriculture during the good years,  for  the  Land  Bank
and other banks, and only  having  it  taxed  in  the  year  of  withdrawal.
Certainty in this regard is essential. We are again  awaiting  an  El  Niñ-o
cycle of terrible weather conditions and if stock farmers  must  sell  their
livestock in order to survive the drought, the  state  should,  due  to  the
lack of any other  drought  measures  at  this  stage,  make  this  facility
available to farmers. This should apply to all farmers. [Time expired.]]

Mr G B BHENGU: Mr Chairman, Deputy Minister and the House at large,  we  are
here today to witness another hallmark in the  history  of  our  country  by
debating and ultimately passing the Land and Agricultural  Development  Bank
Bill.

This Bill has clear and indisputable objectives: to promote, facilitate  and
support the equitable ownership of land and the removal  of  the  legacy  of
the past racial and gender discrimination by  providing  financial  services
to those who need such redress and support.

We note that in the past the  previously  disadvantaged  farmers  could  not
access enough agricultural  land  because  of  the  unattainable  collateral
requirements. It is true that when an equation is effected, the tilting  end
must come even, so that the sloppy end should come up too.

Therefore, reform and redress always have amusement and sadness,  since  the
unevenly juxtaposed elements are brought even. We acknowledge that  redress,
when looked at only from an economic angle, does not make  sense.  But  when
it is looked at from a social angle, it  is  beyond  financial  or  economic
calculation.

The lives of our people need to be  developed.  The  communal  land  systems
should work for the betterment of our people, and as such,  those  who  want
to contribute together for their common good in order to  access  land  must
be assisted financially. The financial support given to these people is  not
thrown into a bottomless pit, but there will be legal  guarantees  in  terms
of clause 30 (1) (a) and (b) of the Bill to solicit  payback  or  make  good
the situation of indebtedness.

It is also not true that all the debtors will be a risk, and it is not  fair
to believe that all of them will go down. In fact, most of  them  will  rise
to the occasion to grab this seemingly remote chance to contribute to  their
and the country's economic development. The lending bank will therefore  not
go down, but it will be sustained.

Third World problems need Third World solutions and understanding. Not  that
we want a laissez faire attitude, but for reform to take place,  there  must
be a starting point. This Bill therefore  serves  as  a  starting  point  in
trusting that the agricultural loan recipients will honour their  commitment
even if they do not provide economically viable collateral.

To allay the fears of those people and institutions that  believe  that  the
Land  and  Agricultural  Development  Bank  is  seemingly  concerned   about
developmental activities instead of being a profit-driven agency,  something
must be done. We may  be  obliged  to  allow  the  bank  to  have  two  main
administrative divisions in its set-up - the market-driven division and  the
development capacity division.

As things  roll  out  to  normalisation  and  the  previously  disadvantaged
debtors stand on their feet, the development capacity division may  have  to
slowly fade into a merger with the profit-driven division.

The amendments to the Bill, as reflected in clause 29  on  the  substitution
of debtors, provide that even if the  debtor  has  an  attachment  execution
order by an ordinary creditor against his or her property, the  bank  has  a
statutory preferential right to the proceeds of the sale over  the  ordinary
creditor's right. Clause 34 of the Bill also gives gives some protection  to
the ordinary creditor to recover  his  or  her  debt  should  there  be  any
surplus flowing from such sales and  preferential  rights  accorded  to  the
bank.

Therefore, as the IFP, we  believe  that  every  possible  avenue  has  been
explored to allow the bank  to  carry  out  two  main  functions,  that  is,
ensuring that it is a profit-driven entity, and facilitating the removal  of
past discrimination and developing the aspirant farmers.  The  IFP  supports
the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms O R KASIENYANE: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and hon  members,  never
has a Bill united agriculture and the banking sector  in  our  democracy  as
the Land and Agricultural Development Bank Bill has, for no one  within  the
two sectors has opposed it. Rather, our committee has just  received  inputs
from these sectors supporting  the  Bill  and  suggesting  improvements  and
changes here and there.

What is of significance is the fact that  all  those  who  made  submissions
supported the need for this new legislation and  the  changes  to  the  Land
Bank.

This Bill is a milestone for our department, especially for those of us  who
come from the rural areas. The need for a bank that will service  our  rural
masses within the agricultural sector cannot be overemphasised,  for  it  is
the rural people who do not possess title  deeds  for  the  land  that  they
plough. The establishment of the  Land  and  Agricultural  Development  Bank
will give them hope that we, as members of Parliament, do care  about  them.
Had this Bill been passed in 1994, the Taung irrigation scheme in the  North
West would have been safe from  decay.  Farmers  would  have  been  assisted
accordingly. But, as the saying goes, better late than never.

It is through this Bill that even  rural  village  banks  will  be  able  to
access funding in the form of grants or wholesale  funding.  The  Government
will also be able to utilise the infrastructure and  capacity  of  the  bank
when it has to distribute emergency aid to our farmers.

Our Government has constantly been criticised by organised farmers  for  not
subsidising them, hence their unfavourable competitive position in  relation
to European Union farmers. I  believe  that  the  favourable  interest  rate
which farmers will be able to get from the Land Bank will, to  some  extent,
counter  this  disadvantage  and  will  assist   in   making   our   farmers
competitive.

In trying to consolidate its financial muscle, and in line with  the  Income
Tax Act, the bank must be  allowed  to  accept  deposits  from  all  farmers
within the agricultural sector. This will  instil  loyalty  and  will  build
goodwill within the farming community. This bank will  be  a  one-stop  shop
for farmers.
Our President said that South Africa was divided into  two  societies.  This
Bill also proves him right. It was clear from  submissions  by  the  Banking
Council of South Africa that they were at pains to  cling  to  their  vested
interests and privileges.  Submissions  from  black  farmers'  organisations
were crying out for the immediate implementation of this Bill.  However,  we
are practical men and women. We do not care whether  the  cat  is  black  or
white; so long as it can catch mice. Surely, this  Bill  is  addressing  the
legacy.

The mistake that the Banking Council is making,  is  to  try  to  equal  the
unequal, to  compare  the  incomparable.  The  exemption  of  the  Land  and
Agricultural Development Bank Bill from certain statutory  provisions  which
apply to ordinary banks is there because the Land Bank is not  a  commercial
bank. It is a vehicle that our Government is going to  use  to  address  the
financial needs of our poor  people.  The  Bill  also  gives  the  Land  and
Agricultural Bank preference over the creditors, and this is because  it  is
the only institution that will overlook normal collateral  requirements.  In
other words, the Bill is giving the Land Bank both  the  responsibility  and
the authority.

The suggestion by the Banking Council that the development  mandate  of  the
Land and Agricultural Development Bank should end at R200 000 is  laughable.
We do not know whether the Banking Council is implying that the  development
cannot be up to R2 million or more. I suggest that they should  revisit  the
objects of the Land  Bank  so  that  they  can  understand  the  development
mandate of the bank better.

The Banking Council must also tell us  what  it  has  done  to  address  the
market that this Bill has been aiming to attend to since  1994.  For  it  is
not the profit margins of the banks that are at stake here,  but  our  moral
obligation  to  uplift  the  lives  of  the  people  and  address  the  past
imbalances. Agri South Africa must be grateful for  this  Bill  as  it  will
enable this sector to cross the Rubicon. For the first  time  white  farmers
will not have the stigma of enjoying privileges that black  farmers  do  not
enjoy, and black farmers, of course, will  now  be  able  to  graduate  from
being subsistence farmers to being commercial farmers, because through  this
Bill the Government  is  making  sure  that  it  is  taking  charge  of  the
empowerment of black farmers. This country must,  within  five  years,  have
sizeable numbers of black commercial farmers, and to that end this  Bill  is
imperative.
To organise black farmers, we say to them that this is a challenge to  them,
to teach their members about the opportunities the Land Bank now  offers  so
that their members should not be the victims of ignorance.

[Since one of the objectives of this Bill is to  redress  the  ills  of  the
past such as racial and gender discrimination, our women,  especially  those
who live in rural areas, will be free to work with determination. They  will
be assured that they have support and influence. There will be  agricultural
projects aimed at their development.

I would like to encourage women to  work  hard  for  a  better  future.  The
excuses of  the  big  banking  institutions,  which  claim  to  finance  the
farmers, will not discourage them. The fact that  it  becomes  difficult  to
assist farmers, especially emergent  farmers,  with  funding,  is  of  great
concern. We will see an  increase  in  the  number  of  women  entering  the
``farmer of the year'' competitions. We  appeal  to  women  to  seize  these
opportunities to improve their lives, and thus live with  their  heads  held
up high. [Applause.]]

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister,  Adjunkminister  en
agb  lede,  dit  is  die  eerste  wetsontwerp  wat  gefinaliseer  is   onder
voorsitterskap van die nuwe voorsitter, mnr Masithela. Ek wil hom  gelukwens
met die nuwe verantwoordelikheid wat hy ontvang het. Hy kan staatmaak op  my
steuning, solank hy in belang van die landbou en grondsake  optree.  Vir  my
as 'n boer is alle sake wat die landbou raak 'n eerste prioriteit.

Ek dink as 'n lid van een van die opposisiepartye wat moontlik  die  langste
saam met adv Holomisa werk, wil ek hom graag bedank vir die wyse  waarop  hy
die portefeuljekomitee  gelei  het.  Dit  het  maar  selde  gebeur  dat  die
verskillende sienings van verskillende partye nie deur hom versoen kon  word
nie. Dit is te danke aan die wyse waarop hy die komitee gelei  het.  Hy  was
altyd kalm en beredeneerd,  sodat  lede  meer  geneë  was  om  konsensus  te
bereik. Ons sal hom mis.

Die landbou in Suid-Afrika het 'n Landbank nodig. Die  Strausskommissie  het
ook aanbeveel dat die Landbank toegerus moet word om die doelwit  te  bereik
om die ongelykhede  van  die  verlede  aan  te  spreek  en  'n  program  van
regstelling daar te stel. Die Landbankwet van 1944  is  bykans  sestig  jaar
oud. Die behoeftes van landboufinansiering het wesenlik verander en was  dit
nodig om dié wetgewing te moderniseer. Verder het die  Grondwet  artikel  34
van die ou wet van 1955 ongrondwetlik verklaar en moes die artikels  voor  9
Junie 2002 verander word. Ek sal teen die einde hierna terugkom.

Die landbou het 'n finansier nodig wat die landbou se probleme  verstaan  en
hom sal instel  om  aan  die  behoeftes,  eiesoortig  aan  die  landbou,  te
voldoen. Daar is boere wat op een hektaar grond of minder  'n  inkomste  wil
verdien, byvoorbeeld deur groente of enige akkerbouproduk  te  plant.  Hulle
het egter nie fondse nie.

Die Landbank het reeds  'n  skema  daar  gestel  wat  aan  hierdie  behoefte
voldoen. Die bank leen  R500  teen  'n  baie  hoë  rentekoers.  Wanneer  dit
terugbetaal word, kwalifiseer die kliënt vir byvoorbeeld R1 000. Die  kliënt
bou dus 'n kredietrekord met tyd op deur sy of haar getroue  terugbetalings.
Ek was bekommerd oor hierdie skema. Na my mening was die rente  te  hoog  en
die lening te riskant. Met ons besoek aan die Landbank in  Januarie  was  my
verbasing groot om te verneem hoe suksesvol die skema is. Na  my  mening  is
die persentasie slegte skuld baie laag vir sulke hoë  riskante  lenings.  Ek
haal dié tipe lening op om te illustreer dat daar besondere behoeftes is  by
nuwe toetreders tot die landbou. Dit illustreer die  behoefte  wat  daar  is
vir 'n instelling soos die Landbank.

Net spesiale voorskrifte en beskerming stel 'n instelling soos die  Landbank
in staat om  sy  spesiale  opdragte  deur  die  wetgewing  ná  te  kom.  Ook
bestaande boere benodig 'n instelling soos die Landbank. Ek  wil  dankie  sê
vir die groot rol  wat  handelsbanke  speel  in  die  finansiering  van  die
landbou. Die banke sal nooit  bedreig  word  deur  dié  beskermingsmaatreëls
nie. Dit het ook nooit in die verlede  die  handelsbanke  bedreig  nie.  Die
bedekte dreigemente dat hulle sal onttrek aan die landbousektor, hoop ek  is
nie ernstig nie. Dit sal 'n tragedie wees.

Die Landbank kan nie die  handelsbanke  se  plek  inneem  nie.  So  ook  kan
handelsbanke nie die rol vervul wat die Landbank moet  inneem  nie.  Om  die
landbou in Suid-Afrika te ontwikkel en uit te bou, moet die twee  instansies
liewers hande vat. Dit is beter om dit wat pla met tyd te verwyder as om  te
onttrek aan ons gesamentlike taak om Suid-Afrika te laat werk.

Ek wil tog net na klousule 32 verwys.  Ek  verstaan  wat  die  klousule  wil
bereik deur lede van 'n vereniging aanspreeklik te  wil  hou.  Die  Landbank
moet egter onthou dat hy die lening goedgekeur het en moet toesien dat  daar
betyds  opgetree  word,  eerder  as  om  lede  wat  lankal  uitgetree   het,
aanspreeklik te hou. Miskien moet ons kyk om  die  aanspreeklikheid  na  die
direksie en die uitvoerende bestuur en bestaande lede oor te dra, eerder  as
na uitgetrede lede. Die Nuwe NP steun die wetsontwerp.

Ek wil egter 'n  ernstige  versoek  rig  dat  wetgewing  betyds  geskryf  of
herskryf word. Ek weet nie wie verantwoordelik is  vir  al  die  vertragings
nie. Die hofuitspraak het ons genoeg tyd gegee  om  hierdie  wetsontwerp  te
verander. Ek meen dat dit onbedagsaam is om weens  onnodige  vertragings  'n
wetsontwerp soos hierdie een deur die portefeuljekomitee te wil  jaag,  want
om onnodige druk op die komitee te plaas, beduiwel net gesindhede.  Ons  wil
nie dit graag in die landbou hê nie. Dit is ook vir my onaanvaarbaar dat  'n
hoofrolspeler in die beplanning van die landbou in Suid-Afrika  eers  op  25
April  2002  die  voorgenome  wetsontwerp  ontvang  het.  Dit  is   vir   my
onverstaanbaar. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mr Chairman, hon Minister, Deputy  Minister  and  hon
members, this is the first Bill to be finalised  under  the  chairpersonship
of the new chairperson, Mr Masithela. I want to congratulate him on the  new
responsibility that has been entrusted to him. He can rely on my support  as
long as he acts in the interests of agriculture and land affairs. To  me  as
a farmer every matter that affects agriculture is a foremost priority.

I think that as a member of one  of  the  opposition  parties  who  possibly
worked with Adv Holomisa the longest, I would like  to  thank  him  for  the
manner in which he led the portfolio committee. It was seldom  that  he  was
unable to reconcile the different viewpoints of different parties.  This  is
thanks to the way in which he led the committee.  He  was  always  calm  and
reasonable, so that members were more inclined to reach consensus. We  shall
miss him.

Agriculture in South Africa needs a Land Bank. The Strauss  commission  also
recommended that the Land Bank should be  equipped  so  as  to  achieve  the
objective of addressing the inequalities of the  past  and  to  introduce  a
reconstruction programme. The Land Bank Act of 1944 is almost 60 years  old.
The requirements of agricultural financing have changed dramatically and  it
was necessary to modernise this legislation.  Furthermore  the  Constitution
declared section 34  of  the  old  Act  of  1955  unconstitutional  and  the
articles had to be amended before 9 June 2002. I shall  come  back  to  this
towards the end.

Agriculture  requires  a  financier  that  understands   the   problems   of
agriculture and one that will attune itself  to  complying  with  the  needs
that are unique to agriculture. There  are  farmers  who  want  to  earn  an
income  from  one  hectare  of  land  or  less,  for  example,  by  planting
vegetables or crops. They do not have the money, however.

The  Land  Bank  has  already  introduced  a  scheme  to  comply  with  this
requirement. The bank lends R500 at a very high interest rate.  When  it  is
paid back, the  client  qualifies  for  R1  000,  for  example.  The  client
therefore in time builds up a credit record  through  his  or  her  faithful
repayments. I was concerned about this scheme. In my view the  interest  was
too high and the loan too risky. Upon our visit to the Land Bank in  January
I was very surprised to learn how successful the scheme is. In my  view  the
percentage of bad debt is very low for such high-risk  loans.  I  am  making
mention of this kind of  loan  to  illustrate  that  there  are  exceptional
requirements among new entrants to  agriculture.  It  illustrates  the  need
that exists for an institution like the Land Bank.

Only special conditions and protection can enable an  institution  like  the
Land Bank to comply with the special instructions by  legislation.  Existing
farmers also need an institution such as the Land Bank. I want to say  thank
you for the major role that  commercial  banks  play  in  the  financing  of
agriculture.  The  banks  will  never  be  threatened  by  these  protective
measures. Nor did they ever previously  threaten  the  commercial  banks.  I
hope the veiled threats that  they  would  withdraw  from  the  agricultural
sector were not meant seriously. It would be a tragedy.

The Land Bank cannot take the place of the  commercial  banks.  Neither  can
commercial banks play the role that the Land Bank must play. To develop  and
expand agriculture in South Africa the two institutions should  rather  link
hands. It is better to remove  what  is  disconcerting  over  time  than  to
withdraw from our joint task of making South Africa work.

I nevertheless want to make reference to clause 32. I  understand  what  the
clause desires to achieve by holding members of a society liable.  The  Land
Bank must remember, however, that it approved the loan and  that  it  should
ensure that action is taken timeously rather  than  holding  liable  members
who retired long ago. Perhaps we should look at  transferring  liability  to
the directors and executive management rather than retired members. The  New
NP supports the Bill.

I want to make a serious plea, however, that legislation must be written  or
rewritten timeously. I do not know who is responsible for  all  the  delays.
The court's findings gave us enough time to amend this Bill. I think  it  is
imprudent to rush a Bill such as this one through  the  portfolio  committee
owing to unnecessary delays, because placing  unnecessary  pressure  on  the
committee only bedevils attitudes. We do not want that  in  agriculture.  It
is  also  unacceptable  to  me  that  a  main  role-player  in  planning  of
agriculture in South Africa only received the  proposed  Bill  on  25  April
2002. This I cannot understand. [Applause.]]

Mr D G MKONO: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  I  am  honoured
to take part in the debate on this Bill on behalf  of  the  hon  Abram,  our
spokesperson on agriculture and land affairs,  who  is  unable  to  be  here
today due to other parliamentary duties, in Pretoria, as  a  member  of  the
Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.

The Bill before us must be seen as an  important  empowerment  measure.  The
Land Bank was originally brought into being to assist in resolving the  poor
white problem and to  place  white  people  in  commercial  agriculture.  It
contributed in no small measure in advancing that cause. With the advent  of
democracy in 1994, its focus had to change.  Millions  of  our  people  were
excluded from this sector. Historical imbalances still exist and our  people
are yearning to enter the agricultural sector. The  Land  Bank  thus  became
the central and pivotal instrument which could help them in their lives  and
turn into reality the frustrations and dreams of our people.  This  amending
Bill is but a small step towards realising that goal.

The majority of our people do not have access to  financing.  For  them  the
reality is that commercial banks provide  an  umbrella  where  it  does  not
rain. The Land Bank has created a product which is called the step-up  loan,
where a small amount is borrowed without any security and, when it is  fully
repaid, the borrower may borrow a high amount and, in this way, build  up  a
credit track record. The Land  Bank  has  developed  several  products,  all
aimed at providing access to finance  for  the  benefit  of  the  previously
disadvantaged communities.

Whilst it is currently involved in assessing rand grants, this Bill  goes  a
long way towards providing a one-stop service to our people. The  Bill  also
provides for the  Land  Bank  to  promote  joint  ventures  in  agri-related
enterprises, a new feature which can only benefit new entrants.  Whilst  the
Land Bank will be able to  continue  serving  the  interests  of  commercial
agriculture, it will now be able to fast-track the agricultural sector  plan
in so far as it relates to its sphere of activity.

The Land Bank's current loan book stands at R16  billion,  which  represents
approximately 50% of South Africa's agricultural loan book.  The  bank  aims
to fast-track peaceful and orderly land  redistribution  and  offers  grants
from R20 000 to a maximum of R100 000,  depending  on  the  applicant's  own
contribution. I urge our people to  empower  themselves  by  making  use  of
these facilities.

The promotion of joint ventures will now see many  of  our  people  entering
agribusiness in developing value-added  products.  These  are  some  of  the
numerous opportunities in this sector and, in terms  of  the  provisions  in
this Bill, we will be able to kickstart it.  The  Land  Bank  will  have  to
actively pursue, as an agent for the Departments  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs, viable means  of  kickstarting  rural  development  so  that  rural
people will find it attractive to remain in there and help  stabilise  rural
communities. It can also, in  co-operation  with  the  Tourism  Board,  help
develop agritourism.

HIV/Aids is also wreaking havoc, especially in rural areas where several  of
the eldest children in households where both parents have died have  assumed
the mantle of responsibility. Ways will have to be found  to  empower  these
young people towards self sufficiency. It stands to reason  that  commercial
banks have expressed dissatisfaction with some of  the  provisions  in  this
Bill. Our problems are unique and we need  to  find  unique  solutions.  The
Bill before us aims to address that by financing commercial farmers.

The commercial banks seldom lose out. Our people who  face  tremendous  odds
cannot be served by commercial banks in this sector. They can never  provide
products ... [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF OF COMMITTEES: Order! Can we lower  our  voices,  please.
The noise level is rather too high.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Mr Chairperson, the  proposed  amendment  to  the  Land
Act,  Act  13,  of  1944,  was  necessary  in  the  light  of  the   Strauss
commission's recommendations. These recommendations, also supported  by  the
court ruling, necessitated the existing amendments to the Act.

The most important principle of the Strauss commission was its  emphasis  on
access to finance by emerging farmers. We  have  in  the  past  and  present
advocated that the  bank  adopt  flexible  and  realistic  funding  criteria
including  the  mechanism  of  recovering  its  debts  from   the   emerging
commercial farmer's loan advanced to them. We all know that  agriculture  is
the backbone of our economy, employing mainly the poorest  of  the  poor  in
rural areas. It is this sector that we need to support financially.

With the democratisation of our country the role of the Land Bank  became  a
focal point of discussion as to how the bank was geared in meeting  the  new
challenges of providing access to its  facilities  for  all  South  Africans
irrespective of their background.  It  is  not  a  secret  that  many  black
farmers in the  past  were  funding  their  farming  operations  from  their
personal savings without any help from financial institutions.

There are also reasons advanced as to why the bank would  not  fund  certain
projects as initiated by the emerging farmers.  The  question  of  risk  and
security appears to be the key determining criterion as to whether or not  a
loan will be granted. With regard to those who are funded by  the  bank,  it
is revealed that they are unable to meet their payment obligations in  time,
and those who succumb to bankruptcy are exposed to the bank's ruthless  debt
collection methods. To us it is not so much about the  collection  of  debts
but about the manner in which clients are treated.

Therefore, the Bill with the current amendment  will,  to  a  large  extent,
address the constitutional requirements of the Act to comply with the  court
ruling. Above all, the Bill will be a first step in empowering the  bank  to
carry out its new mandate to empower  aspirant  and  existing  farmers.  The
UCDP supports the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N W MUDAU: Chairperson, my point of departure derives  from  our  mandate
after our people spoke for the second time in the history of  South  Africa.
The mandate was a very clear one. It was to better the lives of our  people.
As a member of the ANC, which is an agent for change,  I  can  say  that  we
have  the  responsibility  of  carrying  out  this  mandate  and  doing   so
successfully without failing our people. We will continue to  give  priority
to agriculture in all our work that involves the economy.

Following the Strauss commission  report  in  1997,  the  Land  Bank  had  a
mandate to deracialise the  agricultural  sector  and  to  ensure  that  the
resources for emerging farmers were made available. Lessons have  taught  us
that financial  assistance  on  its  own  is  insufficient  and  that  rural
development and poverty alleviation do not come from throwing money  at  the
problem. Instead an inclusive package to customise products, with  technical
and non-technical skills transfer  as  well  as  continuous  monitoring  and
support, is essential for effective capacity-building.

The committee is happy about the decision taken by the Land  Bank  board  of
directors, which, after realising the above challenges, set aside  money  in
order to achieve the following objectives: to make  skill  -  and  capacity-
building  programmes  available  to  emerging  farmers;  to  contribute   to
agricultural education by providing bursaries to students wishing to make  a
contribution to rural upliftment; to fund certain programmes at  educational
institutions aimed at rural upliftment for the agricultural sector.

I am sure that the hon members in this House will agree with me  that  young
people are the future of their  motherland  and  the  hope  of  the  nation.
Therefore I could practically say  that  there  cannot  be  any  integration
without education.

Allow me also to mention briefly some of the projects and  products  of  the
Land Bank that are also aimed at poverty alleviation, job creation  and  the
empowerment of the previously disadvantaged.

The  Land  Redistribution  for  Agricultural   Development   programme   was
officially launched in August 2001  at  the  Nkomazi  irrigation  scheme  in
Mpumalanga. Through the LRAD, the Land Bank,  acting  as  an  agent  of  the
Department of Land Affairs, is  to  fast-track  peaceful  and  orderly  land
distribution. Beneficiaries are able to access grants to purchase  land  and
loans to start agricultural or agriculturally related  businesses  on  their
newly acquired land. Individuals can get a grant from a minimum of  R20  000
to a maximum of R100 000, depending on the individual's own contribution.

Through the Step-up repayment scheme the Land  Bank  encourages  individuals
to make a shift from being job-seekers  to  becoming  job-creators,  thereby
creating job opportunities in their communities. Under this scheme the  bank
has already lent R117 million to over 70 000 clients who are mostly women.

This  reflects  a  commitment  to  create  entrepreneurs  who  will   uplift
communities and eradicate poverty. What is interesting in this is  that  the
clients attend seminars before the applications are processed.

Therefore there is a need for a massive awareness campaign programme on  the
products  of  the  Land  Bank  by  the  bank  itself  and  by  hon  members,
particularly when we do our constituency work, to make sure that our  people
are aware of these products, the system itself, and  how  to  acquire  those
loans.

Perhaps we should also look into the question of getting  satellite  offices
of some kind in the far rural areas which would assist those communities  up
there.

There is a great need to encourage  our  people  to  form  agricultural  co-
operatives with the assistance of the Land Bank. Clear  guidelines  need  to
be developed for the targeted groups. One is mentioning  these  because  co-
operatives have  historically  been  important  in  transforming  the  rural
economy. It is  therefore  important  that  the  Land  Bank's  mandate  must
include the promotion of co-operatives.

The Land Bank is simply too important a body in terms of food  security  and
the rural labour market to allow it  to  be  raided  by  an  emerging  rural
bourgeoisie that enjoys preferential access to  political  levels  and  this
easy financing. This is why the Land Bank must include in  its  mandate  the
promotion of collectively and  co-operatively  owned  enterprises  based  on
land use. The Land Bank must become a strong and sustainable rural  people's
lending institution.

Therefore this Bill must make it possible for the Land Bank to  develop  and
become such an institution. In future this may require  the  undertaking  of
major restructuring that may transform  the  bank's  current  viability  and
operating style. The Bill must not close  off  such  possibilities  for  the
bank.

There is a need to  look  to  other  countries  for  advice  and  support  -
countries such as the Philippines, with their diverse  range  of  rural  and
other banks. We also have to look more seriously at our own models, such  as
the Investment and  Financial  Services  Association  Ltd  and  the  village
banks. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the PAC supports this Bill. The objects  of  the
new Land and Agricultural Development Bank Bill read  like  the  objects  of
the PAC. For us the question of ``equitable ownership of agricultural  land,
in  particular  the  increase  of  ownership   of   agricultural   land   by
historically disadvantaged persons'' - these are  the  exact  words  of  the
Bill - is, actually, the core issue of transformation.

If one got into a car and  drove  from  Pietersburg  to  Pretoria;  or  from
Pretoria to Durban or Cape Town, etc, one would realise  that  South  Africa
is a large country, with vast expanses of land. But on both  the  right-hand
and left-hand side  of  the  car,  for  all  the  kilometres  and  hours  of
travelling, one would see land which the  previously  disadvantaged  persons
do not own or occupy, in sharp contrast to shocking  overpopulation  in  the
locations, resettlement camps and villages.

The purpose of this  Bill  is  to  address  that  anomaly.  It  is  a  basic
transformation and development  Bill.  To  bring  about  change  among  poor
people  is  easier  said  than  done.  We  need  to  bring   resources   and
opportunities of development to the vast majority of the population of  this
land. We should all support this Bill, not only as we debate  and  pass  it,
but, more importantly, as it enters the implementation phase. Our future  as
a country depends on the work of  this  bank.  We  in  the  PAC,  I  repeat,
support this Bill.

May I,  in  the  last  minute,  congratulate  the  new  chairperson  of  our
committee, Mr Masithela, but in  a  very  special  way  thank  the  outgoing
chairman. I thought it was one of the best things that the ANC ever  did  to
get a chief to head this committee, because there is a real  tie-up  between
the land and the work of a chief.

Mr S B FARROW: Chairperson, the Bill before us today is the  result  of  the
recommendation of a Commission of Inquiry led by Strauss into the  provision
of rural financial services. The   commission  released  its  report  on  18
September 1996 and Cabinet approved the recommendations on  6  August  1997.
As a result of a Constitutional Court ruling which has been  addressed  here
by previous speakers, in the case First National Bank of South  Ltd  v  Land
and Agricultural Bank of South Africa, Sections 34 and 55 of the  Land  Bank
Act were judged unconstitutional.  These  sections  had  to  be  amended  or
replaced before 9 June 2002, so there was nearly a two-year  period  allowed
to escape invalidation.

Sections 34 and 55 provided remedies for the Land  Bank  against  defaulting
debtors, permitting the Land Bank to recover debts  without  recourse  to  a
court of law and other legal processes. This, in effect,  conferred  a  form
of statutory preference on the bank.

Two years later, the resultant passage  of  the  Bill,  since  the  Minister
announced the intention to introduce it to the House, has been,  to  put  it
bluntly, nothing but rapid.

The portfolio committee received the Bill in its original form on 24  April.
Many stakeholders did not have the full opportunity  to  put  forward  their
concerns within the two  meetings  of  the  portfolio  committee,  and  many
amendments had to be made. The DA appealed for  the  Bill  to  be  presented
again in its amended,  clean  form,  and  for  a  clause-by-clause  type  of
approach to be taken, only to find that this opportunity  was  not  possible
because of the attempt to get the Bill into  the  processes  of  Parliament.
Today we sit in this House debating the Bill, not really having had time  to
properly apply our minds to its final  content,  which  we  received  at  12
o'clock today.

Two particular matters raise concern. The first one is  how  the  Land  Bank
will operate within the framework of the Financial  Services  Board  Act  in
the light of its dual role as a profit-orientated financial  institution  on
the one hand, and a development institution on the other.  In  this  regard,
the Strauss  commission  recommended  that  they  support  the  need  for  a
financial institution with both wholesale and  retail  activities,  and  the
responsibility to dedicate special attention to the  needs  of  land  reform
programme beneficiaries.

In  order  to  foster  an  integrated  approach  to  both  urban  and  rural
development, the commission further considered it  essential  to  create  an
entity to co-ordinate  and  guide  the  activities  of  development  finance
institutions. In this regard they  have  proposed  the  establishment  of  a
development council, which should, in  terms  of  statute,  secure  the  co-
ordination of national finance institutions across South  Africa  under  the
Department of Finance.

In identifying the need for direct grants during the establishment phase  of
its new responsibility, this grant should be  assessed  at  the  outset  and
annually thereafter, on  a  three-year  cycle.  That  is  what  the  Strauss
commission said. The grant should be administered through  a  separate  line
budget, thus keeping apart the profit-orientated finance activity  from  the
development one, and I think the Deputy Minister alluded to that.
Now I know that this could be perceived as operational  detail,  but  unless
these aspects are clearly defined upfront, the Land Bank could, once  again,
because of statutory privilege, be challenged in  the  courts.  This  aspect
was strongly argued, as it was quite rightly said, by the  Banking  Council,
which  referred  to  the  three  reports  that  emanated  from  the  SA  Law
Commission, including the Strauss commission, which concluded,  that,  inter
alia, the statutory provisions that provide preferential  credit  status  to
the Land Bank should be dropped.

I am not a legal person, but one has to  take  into  consideration  some  of
these submissions when passing legislation in this  House.  Although  we  in
the DA respect and agree on the concepts  of  the  Bill  in  bringing  about
equity  and  levelling  the  playing  fields  in  regard   to   historically
disadvantaged farmers, it seems inappropriate to have  to  pass  legislation
that could have legal  recourse  and  therefore  require  further  amending,
merely because we have not done a thorough or professional job.

The second issue which I would like to raise as a concern is  the  need  for
this Bill to be harmonised with the strategic plan  for  agriculture,  which
was released by the President at the end of last  year.  This  plan  clearly
mentions the need to devise innovative financial  instruments  to  help  new
and existing farmers manage the effects  of  high  interest  rates  on  cash
flow, the importance of financial institutions' being globally  competitive,
innovative substitutes for collateral,  and  the  establishment  of  locally
based and micro financial institutions that include  financial  service  co-
operatives and village banks. Yet the Bill eludes these and other issues.

At a portfolio committee meeting these issues  were  tabled  by  Agri  South
Africa, and it was agreed that as an annexure to this Bill a  code  of  good
practice needs to be drawn up, which will cater for these concerns raised.

I would further argue that in terms of good governance, protocols should  be
entered into with the Departments of Agriculture and Land Affairs to  ensure
that  certain  actions  relating  to  land  settlement,  land   reform   and
restitution are addressed by this Bill.

We are informed today that some 669 000 hectares of state land has  been  or
is in the process of transfer, and it is imperative that once  ownership  is
acquired, the bank offers a  package  service  to  these  emerging  farmers,
including  capital,  extension,  marketing  and   risk-management,   because
without these one is going to end up with a lot of failures.

If we as members of Parliament in this House  want  to  see  this  piece  of
legislation work, then it is imperative that we ensure that the  bank  meets
its objectives, and in so doing be in a position to be held accountable  for
its actions. The DA hopes and trusts that the piece  of  legislation  before
us today meets up to the expectations of many  of  our  disadvantaged  rural
communities who wait in anticipation  to  become  part  of  land  ownership,
sustainable  agrarian  reform  and  development  in  South  Africa.  The  DP
supports this Bill.

I would just like while I have  a  few  seconds  here,  to  raise  an  issue
relating to the remuneration of many of the senior managers and the  CEO  of
this bank, which created so much controversy last year or the  year  before.
In terms of clause 17, I think,  the  onus  now  lies  on  the  Minister  to
actually look at those issues to  ensure  that  we  are  not  getting  these
highly paid executives in  the  office  of  a  parastatal  of  this  nature.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! May I just call  the  House  to
better order. I think too many of you are carrying on a debate  concurrently
with the person speaking.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the issue of land still haunts  South  Africa.
The injustices of the past, the Group Areas Act,  the  eviction  of  people,
the robbery of land from the inhabitants of South Africa resulted  from  the
era of colonialism and apartheid.

Our Government seeks to compensate those losses with equity. This Bill  also
seeks to assist in correcting the injustices of the past and to  bridge  the
gap. It promotes equitable ownership of agricultural land by increasing  the
ownership of  such  land  by  historically  disadvantaged  groups.  It  also
mobilises the dormant potential of those who have slogged on such farms  and
have the knowledge to run them but were never allowed to make profit out  of
that knowledge.

The MF is glad that this Bill serves to institute agrarian reform  and  land
restitution, programmes to facilitate farming and  agricultural  enterprises
among the historically disadvantaged.

Although our Constitution has outlawed racism and discrimination, it is  sad
to note that the presence of these is still felt. We have media coverage  of
a number of incidents that visibly exhibit them. Through Bills such as  this
one, Government may pick through the many sectors with a  fine-toothed  comb
to eradicate completely racism  and  its  horrible  cousin,  discrimination,
from our society.

This Bill assists in working that comb through the  agricultural  sector  in
eradicating the past  racial  and  gender  discrimination  evident  in  this
sector. The MF supports the Land and  Agricultural  Development  Bank  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, one of the imbalances  we  inherited  from
the past is access to finance and land by black people. This  phenomenon  is
still with us today.

The Land and Agricultural Development Bank Bill seeks to remedy a  situation
where the majority of black farmers and would-be farmers  are  not  able  to
access finance and land for agricultural  production.  Azapo  supports  this
Bill because fundamentally it seeks to establish a bank whose  objective  it
is  to  effect  change  in  the  patterns  of  landownership  by  increasing
ownership  and  participation  in  the  agricultural  sector,  as  well   as
providing financial support to historically disadvantaged poor people.

To  Azapo  any  acceleration  in  efforts  that  facilitate  the   equitable
ownership of agricultural land and other forms of land will always  get  our
support. When this Bill becomes law, for the first time, black  people  will
have a friendly bank where the agricultural needs of  black  people  can  be
catered for.

The participation of the majority of our people in agriculture  will  indeed
increase our capacity to feed the nation. For the first time  in  the  lives
of the majority, there will be at least one bank in  our  country  that  can
claim to serve the agricultural needs of the poor. There is  no  other  bank
in this country that serves the interests of the poor. [Applause.]
Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Chairperson, colleagues, in his most recent annual  report,
Eskom chairman R J Khoza conceptualises the Africa of  the  new  millennium,
and states, inter alia, the following:


  An Africa more excited by its future than by its past.
  An Africa whose scope for growth is limited only by its imagination.
  An Africa that has successfully translated its concepts of  humanity  and
  communal relations into  vibrant  co-operative  models  of  governmental,
  institutional and individual relations.
  An  Africa  whose  intellectuals  are  nurtured  by  indigenous  founding
  principles and insatiable enquiry.
  An Africa that redefines the term ``emergent'' from one of  condescension
  and derision to one of economic, political  and  cultural  vibrancy,  and
  technological prowess.

He then goes on to say that Africa needs business leadership, and I quote:


  ... whose defining features are probity, humility, integrity,  compassion
  and humanity; that demonstrates  competence,  tenacity  and  a  sense  of
  efficacy; that practises introspection and  self-renewal;  that  strongly
  believes that the locus of control for Africa's future is  within  Africa
  herself;  that  does  not  consume  seed  capital  but  invests  for  the
  generations to come; and above all else, that is visionary!

In many ways this also encompasses the  vision  of  the  Land  Bank  in  its
pivotal developmental role within South Africa's  agricultural  sector.  The
realisation of the dreams of a democratic South Africa in 1994  could  never
be seen or experienced as a goal in itself. It was but a beacon on the  road
towards the attainment of  a  fair  and  just,  democratic,  nonracial,  and
nonsexist society. Before this goal is attained, we as the  torchbearers  of
the  political  consciences  and  aspirations  of  the  people,   have   not
succeeded.

The equitable redistribution of land and broadening the base  of  commercial
agriculture  are  fundamental  to  the  success  of  a  national  democratic
revolution. Sustainable agricultural practice  will  enhance  the  lives  of
rural people. Progress in this regard will  determine  if  the  prophets  of
doom, who predict a Zimbabwe type  of  land  reform  in  South  Africa,  are
proved correct or not. The Land Bank will play an  essential  role  in  this
regard. Farms repossessed as a result of payment default must  be  earmarked
for redistribution.

The Land Bank Act, Act 13 of 1944, provided  for  the  establishment  of  an
institution providing financing services advantageous to  bona  fide  -  and
one can read, ``white'' - farmers in the old South Africa.  After  1948  the
Land Bank became, with rare  exception,  an  instrument  of  the  government
rewarding those who belonged to  the  right  party,  or  better  still,  who
belonged  to  the  right  secret  organisation.  The  Land  Bank   and   the
Agricultural Credit Board were  all  but  in  name  exclusive  institutions,
legalising rewards to the party faithful.

A study of land transactions prior to the announcement of the Orange, or  as
we  know  it  now,  the  Gariep  Fish  River  Project,  and  the  subsequent
appropriation of land  destined  for  irrigation,  should  make  interesting
reading. Similarly, the beneficiaries of land and  property  acquired  under
apartheid legislation, more often than  not,  had  an  inside  track  within
government.

Hoe traumaties dit ook al mag wees, moet hierdie  waarhede  openbaar  gemaak
word. Dit help nie om die huidige Regering  oor  die  korrupsie  wat  bekend
gemaak word deur die waghonde wat hy  self  ingestel  het  te  verdoem  nie,
terwyl die institusionele korrupsie van die ou regering onder die mat  gevee
word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Traumatic as it may be, these truths have to be made public. It is no  good
running down the present Government in respect of  the  corruption  that  is
being uncovered by the watchdogs appointed by it,  while  the  institutional
corruption of the old government is being swept under the carpet.]

Enough about the past. What is of importance is that  since  1994  the  Land
Bank  has  become  a  positive  instrument  for  change.  The  bank  is  now
accessible  to  all,  white  and  black,  those  previously  advantaged   or
disadvantaged. The process gained momentum under the guidance of former  CEO
Helena Dolny, and she deserves our commendation for her positive  leadership
in the transformation of this institution.

Despite amendments to the Land Bank Act, Act 13 of 1944, in  1995  and  1998
it became apparent that the old Act could no longer stand the test of  time.
The Constitutional Court ruling underlined this imperative. This Bill,  when
enacted, will undoubtedly provide the basis for the  Land  and  Agricultural
Development Bank to play its rightful  role  in  the  rural  development  of
South Africa.

In a broad  definition  of  its  mission,  the  Land  Bank  as  a  financial
institution slots in where the commercial financial institutions are  either
unwilling or unable to become  similarly  involved.  It  is  an  institution
established  by  Government  which  will,  in  line  with  ANC  policy,   be
instrumental in creating a just and equitable society in  the  rural  areas,
and we do not apologise for that. [Applause.]

It is accepted that commercial banks have a significant involvement, in  the
vicinity of R11,172 billion, in  the  agricultural  sector.  This  interest,
however, is virtually exclusively  limited  to  the  commercial  sector.  In
relation to the total  business  of  these  institutions,  it  is,  however,
relatively minute, plus-minus 2%.

In its presentation to the  portfolio  committee,  the  Banking  Council  of
South Africa insisted on the level playing-field  principle  and  threatened
recourse to the Constitutional Court and the closure of  branches  in  rural
areas, if the Bill was not amended accordingly.

Enough has been  said  about  the  so-called  offending  sections  regarding
exemption from the long-term insurance Act, statutory pledges,  remedies  on
default, general operations, immovable property, preparation  and  execution
of documents, exemption from stamp duties and other fees, evaluations -  and
transitional matters.

The countries of the developing world are in general forced  to  compete  on
an unlevel playing field against the  developed  countries.  Agriculture  in
particular is subjected to  unfair  discrimination.  Massive  subsidies  are
given to farmers both in the EU and the US. In the latter,  we  just  heard,
increased subsidies amount to $180 billion over the next few years.  On  the
contrary, the liberalisation of agriculture in South Africa has resulted  in
one of, if not the, most deregulated agricultural sectors in the world.

Incidentally, I would like to  congratulate  our  former  Minister,  Comrade
Derek Hanekom, for being  honoured  with  an  award  from  the  Free  Market
Foundation for his  role  in  freeing  the  agricultural  marketing  sector.
[Applause.]

In this environment, it is demanded by Sacob that there be  a  levelling  of
the playing field and that transformation within agriculture  must  proceed.
With respect, there is no way that our emerging farmers,  whom  we  want  to
assist to become the commercial farmers of tomorrow,  can  be  subjected  to
the ravages of the market economy. Special financing and marketing  measures
are indispensable for their progress and survival.

The motives of any person or institution opposing this must  be  questioned.
The involvement of commercial banks  in  the  micro-  lending  business  was
clearly not for the upliftment of the previously disadvantaged  sector,  but
for the harvesting of envisaged massive profits  in  the  short-term,  high-
interest, high-risk sector. That they burnt their fingers might be a bit  of
poetic justice.

The acid test for commercial banks is the mere fact that their  interest  on
small deposits is completely eroded by excessive banking costs.  My  message
to them is that they should get their house  in  order  before  attacking  a
credible institution such as the Land Bank and threatening court action.

Approximately 41%, which is R13,7 billion, of  the  commercial  agricultural
debt is owed to the Land Bank. This involvement of the bank  counterbalances
its exposure in the emerging  sector.  Obviously,  its  more  secured  loans
assist in the ability to provide loans in  the  developmental  sector.  This
dual role of the  bank  cannot  be  separated.  Accordingly,  it  is  to  be
welcomed that the portfolio committee was unanimous in its acceptance of  an
amendment which was put forward by Agri SA to state, in the preamble of  the
Bill, that one of the objectives of the bank is  to  promote  a  competitive
and profitable agricultural sector.

The Land Bank - under the chairmanship of Mr Sam Mkhabela and  the  CEO,  Mr
Monwabisi Fandeso,  and  his  management  team  -  is  geared  to  meet  the
challenges facing agriculture in South Africa. They  are  relatively  young,
energetic  and  visionary.  They  are  part  of  the   new   generation   of
professionals of whom we are justly proud. [Applause.] They are prepared  to
work hard and smart to ensure a better life for all,  especially  our  rural
poor. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Mr Chairman,  I  would
like to first of all thank all those who participated  in  this  debate  for
their support of this Bill. Now that he has succeeded in  passing  his  test
here, I would also like to extend my congratulations to the new chairman  of
the committee, Mr Masithela, who is my  old  friend  from  the  Free  State.
[Applause.] From my side, I would also like to thank the  previous  chairman
for the great role that  he  has  played  in  this  committee  and  for  the
excellent way in which he has done his work.

Let me answer a few of the matters that have been raised  by  the  speakers.
Dr Kraai van Niekerk suggested that  additional  funding  should  be  found,
through Parliament, in order to cater for development. In actual  fact,  the
Bill already makes provision for that  in  clause  22  (1)  (d).  Should  it
become necessary, it is a policy decision  that  has  to  be  taken  by  the
Government and Parliament. The provision  is  there  to  take  care  of  the
situation, should additional funding be necessary.

He also asked about the practice by which, in terms of the income  tax  law,
farmers sell cattle during the times  of  drought,  for  example,  and  then
invest in the Land Bank, and  whether  that  will  continue.  I  can  gladly
confirm that that will continue. There is  no  intention  to  work  on  that
matter and amend that arrangement in the  Income  Tax  Act.  It  is  a  very
advantageous system. We need it in South Africa. By the way, Dr Van  Niekerk
asked to be excused and said that he would not be  present  at  this  stage,
understandably, for certain personal reasons.

Could I just, then, thank  Mr  Bhengu  for  referring  to  the  question  of
communal land in his speech.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  especially  the
members of the Deputy Minister's own party, you should be  giving  your  own
member the maximum amount of support rather than continuing  with  your  own
debates.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Mr Chairman, they  are  discussing  what  I  am  saying
here. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! If they are, then I think  that
they are well within the order of the House. But, if not, they  are  outside
of the orders.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Mr Chairman, I wanted to comment about  what  was  said
by Mr Bhengu regarding the communal land system. He  said  that  there,  the
Land and Agricultural Development Bank Bill must work for the betterment  of
our people. Yes, I think that we must definitely find methods in  which  the
Land Bank's services may be used for their purpose in communal areas.  I  do
believe, however, that certain other legislation must  first  be  considered
by Parliament before we can really talk about a technique  that  works.  The
point is: We must get a result there.

Regarding the contribution of Comrade Kasienyane, with special reference  to
Taung, I would like to say that I know the area and I just do  not  want  to
die before  Taung  has  been  re-established  as  a  full  productive  area.
[Applause.] We must work there. Could I just say that,  in  brackets,  there
is a lot of detail around the Land  Bank.  Hon  members  should  know  that,
regarding  women,  the  Land  Bank  has  a   microfinancing   scheme   which
accentuates its development role and which is called the Step-up  programme.
Under that scheme, I believe, some R170 million has  been  lent  to  70  000
clients, most of whom are women. It is a special product  which  is  used  a
lot by women. The interesting thing is  that  the  repayment  rate  of  that
scheme is 86%, which is excellent given the area  in  which  work  is  being
done. [Applause.] Women pay their debts, apparently - they do.  So  I  would
like to thank Ms Kasienyane for her observations around the  democratisation
of the Land Bank. It is not only for whites any more.

I think that I must make my comments and conclusion because, apparently,  my
time is running out. Mr A van Niekerk commented a lot about the  problem  of
the delays in this Bill. Could I just state it as a fact that the  Bill  was
delivered to the state law advisers on 31 July last year. We got it back  in
October, which is a long time. It was not the individual legal  adviser  who
sat on the  matter  for  so  long  but,  apparently,  some  delay  has  been
experienced in the administrative procedures pertaining  to  the  state  law
advisers. I do believe  that  we  must,  in  a  co-operative  fashion,  work
through the Speaker and the state law advisers to address  this  problem.  I
also think that the Whips in Parliament should take some initiative.

I actually wanted to reply to every member who spoke  but  it  will  not  be
possible. Regarding the matters which Mr Farrow addressed, I would  like  to
say that the Financial Services Board did not  raise  its  concerns  in  the
portfolio committee. They were addressed and solved by  our  team,  together
with the Financial Services Board, outside  of  that  procedure.  Mr  Farrow
asked that  a  percentage  which  should  go  towards  development  must  be
indicated in  the  Bill,  and  another  percentage  which  will  go  towards
commercial work. I do not think that that is possible at all, because it  is
not a legal matter at all. It is  a  financial  matter  which  must  receive
attention from time to time regarding how  one  balances  developmental  and
commercial financing. It depends on financial circumstances. One cannot  fix
it in the Bill for all time.

By the way, I would like to indicate to Mr Farrow that the code  of  conduct
is  not  an  annexure  to  the  Bill.  It  must  still  be  developed.   The
remuneration of the CEO and other high officials of the  Land  Bank  is,  of
course, a matter which will receive the closest attention of the Minister.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Deputy  Minister,  start  to
conclude now. I have given you a little more time. Please, do conclude now.

The DEPUTY  MINISTER:  Thank  you,  sir,  I  will  conclude.  Regarding  the
remuneration, we must bear in mind that the loan book of this bank is  about
R16 billion, and that does reflect on the type of remuneration  that  should
be earned. But I am sure that the Minister has a  keen  sense  of  what  the
bank must attain and what type of personnel is needed for that.

I do thank the members for the debate. Thank you, Mr Chairman. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 18:20.

     (1)    Fourth Report of the Working Group on the African Union


         Part 1: Activities of the Working Group


         A. Introduction


         The Working  Group  was  established  on  16  November  2001  by  a
         resolution of the National  Assembly.  The  primary  focus  of  the
         Working  Group  was  to  consider   the   implementation   of   the
         Constitutive Act of the African Union.


         B. Objectives of the Working Group


         The brief of the Working Group is to:


              *   Consider Parliament's participation in the  implementation
                  of the Constitutive Act of the African Union  and  suggest
                  appropriate procedural mechanisms for this.
              *   Determine the involvement of Parliament in  assisting  the
                  South African government in the process of  implementation
                  of the African Union.


         C. Meetings of the Working Group


         The Working Group met on 15 January  2002,  14  February  2002,  27
         February 2002, 28 February 2002, 7 March 2002, 18  March  2002,  30
         April 2002 and  10  May  2002.  The  Working  Group  established  a
         Planning Team to address detailed planning and  technical  matters.
         The Planning Team held its first meeting on 19 February  2002.  The
         Working Group met with members of the  Inter-Ministerial  Committee
         on the African Union on 28 February 2002  to  discuss  the  African
         Union.


         D. Seminar on the African Union


         A seminar on the African Union was held on 1 and 2 March  2002,  in
         cooperation with the Africa  Institute  of  South  Africa  and  the
         Institute  for  Global  Dialogue.   Members   of   Parliament   and
         representatives from the Departments of Foreign Affairs  and  Trade
         and Industry attended the seminar. The objectives  of  the  seminar
         were to:


              *   Acquaint Members with the African Union (AU).
              *   Allow Members to engage with the challenges posed  by  the
                  implementation of the Constitutive Act.
              *    Encourage  Members  to  consider  the  participation   of
                  Parliament in the process of shaping the evolution of  the
                  AU.
              *   Discuss the role of South Africa in the implementation  of
                  the Constitutive Act.
              *   Share knowledge and insight with the  research  institutes
                  and Government Departments present.


         Part 2- Record of Working Group Discussions


         E. Summary of Seminar Discussions


         Following its reports to  the  National  Assembly  on  27  February
         2002, 12 March  2002  and  18  March  2002,  interaction  with  the
         members of the Inter-Ministerial  Committee,  deliberations  during
         the aforementioned meetings, including the seminar on  the  African
         Union and the debate on the African Union on 12 March 2002  in  the
         National Assembly,  the  Working  Group  wishes  to  highlight  the
         following  considerations  regarding  the  establishment   of   the
         African Union and the implementation of  the  Constitutive  Act  of
         the African Union.


         1. Political Considerations


         Consideration should be given to, amongst others,  issues  such  as
         what  constitutes  a  conducive  political  environment,  political
         integration, ceding sovereignty, and human rights.


         (a)     Political Environment
              *   In the transition from the OAU to the  AU,  membership  to
                  the AU is open to all Member States of  the  OAU  (Article
                  27).  In the future,  consideration  should  be  given  to
                  whether to maintain  this  principle  of  inclusivity  for
                  Member  States  whose  political  environments   are   not
                  conducive to the attainment of the objectives of the AU.
              *   Mechanisms need to be developed to encourage Member States
                  to  create  and  maintain  political   environments   that
                  promote democracy and good governance.


         (b)     Political Integration


              *   Political integration may be seen as a means through which
                  African States are  empowered  to  face  their  respective
                  challenges.  The  AU  can  be  perceived  as  an  evolving
                  structure responding to the challenges facing Africa.
              *   There is  a  need  to  bridge  historical  and  linguistic
                  divisions  in  Africa   in   order   to   promote   unity,
                  solidarity, cohesion and cooperation among the peoples  of
                  Africa and African States.


         (c)     Ceding Sovereignty


              *   The Constitutive Act provides  for  political  and  socio-
                  economic integration and a common  defence  policy,  which
                  could impact on the  sovereignty  of  States.   Thus,  the
                  constitutionality of ceding  sovereignty  with  regard  to
                  these issues raises some concern.
              *   South Africa may need to consider the principles and terms
                  of ceding its sovereignty in a way that  does  not  impact
                  negatively on the human rights of its citizens.  A  phased
                  and strategic approach may be necessary.


         (d)     Human Rights


              *   In respect  of  human  rights,  it  may  be  necessary  to
                  consider an appropriate role for the Commission  on  Human
                  and Peoples' Rights in relation to the AU.
              *   With regard to the Charter on Human and  Peoples'  Rights,
                  it is noted that there  have  been  many  developments  in
                  international human rights law, since the adoption of  the
                  Charter in 1987.  A review of  the  Charter  to  establish
                  congruence with current human rights law thereby  ensuring
                  the effective promotion and protection of human rights  as
                  envisaged under Article 3 of  the  Act  may  therefore  be
                  required.


         2. Legislative Considerations


         Some of the key legal considerations include the following:


              *   Legal implications
              *   Drafting and interpretation
              *   The Court of Justice
              *   The Central Organ
              *   International Intervention
              *   Organs of the AU
         (a)     Legal implications


              *   Legal opinion received from the South  African  State  Law
                  Advisers indicates that the Constitutive  Act  of  the  AU
                  does   not   conflict   with   domestic   law.     Further
                  consideration may need to be given to whether the  Act  is
                  consistent  with  International  law  and  South  Africa's
                  international obligations.
              *   Whilst the  Constitutive  Act  does  not  have  any  self-
                  executing provisions, Member  States  may  be  obliged  to
                  harmonise existing, or enact new domestic  laws  in  order
                  to  give  legal  effect   to   the   provisions   of   the
                  Constitutive Act.
              *    South  Africa  may  need   to   consider   amending   its
                  Constitution  to  accomodate  its  obligations  under  the
                  Constitutive Act.


         (b)     Drafting and interpretation


              *   Attention may need to be paid to  inconsistencies  in  the
                  drafting  of  the  Constitutive  Act.   The  'soft'  legal
                  drafting in Article 3(c), (l)  and  (n)  compared  to  the
                  definitive legal drafting in  Article  9(a),  for  example
                  may create some ambiguity and vagueness in the Act.
              *   There appear to be no contradictions  or  ambiguity  among
                  Articles 4 (a), (g), and (h). Article  4(h)  dealing  with
                  grounds for intervention by the Union in  the  affairs  of
                  Member States should take into account Article  3  (h)  in
                  respect of reference to the promotion  and  protection  of
                  human  rights.   Consideration  may  be   given   to   the
                  expansion of  the  grounds  for  intervention  to  include
                  violations of human and peoples' rights.
              *   To  facilitate  democratic  decision  making,  checks  and
                  balances may need to be built into the  Constitutive  Act.
                  In this light, the quorum for Assembly decisions may  need
                  to be re-examined,  particularly  with  regard  to  policy
                  decisions and issues relating to ceding sovereignty.
              *   The Act needs to be revised  to  reflect  gender-sensitive
                  language.


         (c)     Court of Justice


              *   It is suggested that  the  Protocol  makes  the  Court  of
                  Justice the supreme  institution  for  the  protection  of
                  peoples and human rights.  In terms of the  South  African
                  Constitution however,  the  Constitutional  Court  is  the
                  supreme  court  protecting  basic   human   rights.    The
                  consequences of deferring  or  referring  matters  to  the
                  Court of Justice may need to be considered.
              *   With reference to Article 3(h),  it  is  likely  that  the
                  Court of Justice will make decisions based on the  African
                  Charter which may have become outdated in terms  of  human
                  rights.   The  South  African  Constitution,  being   more
                  recent, is more in line with international  best  practice
                  in  this  regard.   Also,  the  equality  clauses  in  the
                  African Charter and the  South  African  Constitution  are
                  different.  The Court of Justice will  therefore  function
                  from  a  different  legal  basis.   This  may  cause  some
                  tension. Mechanisms may be  required  to  regulate  issues
                  that can be brought before the Court of Justice.   Further
                  discussion is required regarding the jurisdiction  of  the
                  Court of Justice.
              *   While South Africa has extended the right to class actions
                  to organs of civil society in the interest of the  public,
                  many countries do not make a similar provision.  Thus,  if
                  the Constitutive Act  provides  for  class  actions,  some
                  Member States would need to pass domestic laws  to  comply
                  with their obligations in terms  of  this  Act.   Concerns
                  were raised about the possibility of foreign NGOs  funding
                  class actions in different Member States to  advance  non-
                  African agendas.


         (d)     Central Organ


              *   It is envisaged that the Central Organ will be established
                  through  Article  9(1)(d).   Since  this   represents   an
                  important organ, consideration may need  to  be  given  to
                  its establishment by the principal  Act  under  Article  5
                  and  not  by  the   Assembly   under   Article   9.    The
                  relationship between the Central Organ  and  the  Assembly
                  of the AU may therefore need to be redefined.
              *   The intended focus of the  Central  Organ  is  safety  and
                  security.  The extension of the role of the Central  Organ
                  to  all  matters  of  human  security  may  need   to   be
                  considered.
              *   The relationship amongst the Central Organ, the Conference
                  on Security, Stability,  Development  and  Cooperation  in
                  Africa (CSSDCA), the Conflict  Management  Centre  of  the
                  OAU and the UN needs clarification.


         (e)     International Intervention


              *   Whilst the need for intervention as envisaged by  the  Act
                  is acknowledged, it may be necessary to  ensure  that  any
                  form of  intervention  occurs  within  the  parameters  of
                  public international law.
              *   South  African  representatives  to  the  AU  need  to  be
                  vigilant in ensuring  that  the  AU  does  not  adopt  any
                  provisions that will impact negatively on  South  Africa's
                  international obligations.  An  audit  of  South  Africa's
                  international obligations is envisaged.


         (f)     Organs of the AU


              *   Whilst the Act provides for the establishment  of  various
                  organs, specific time frames for their  establishment  are
                  not set. The  lack  of  defined  time  frames  may  impact
                  negatively on the implementation of the Act.
              *   The Act is also unclear regarding the separate powers  and
                  functions of the different organs.  There  is  overlap  in
                  authority of some organs  thus  making  it  unclear  which
                  organs would have jurisdiction over what matters.


         3. Economic Considerations
         (a)     General


              *   The AU envisages accelerating efforts to promote  economic
                  integration in Africa.  This raises the central  issue  of
                  the   appropriate   strategy   for   promoting    economic
                  integration.  The conventional trade integration  approach
                  focuses on removal of tariff and regulatory  barriers  and
                  moving from Free  Trade  Area  to  Customs  Union,  common
                  market  and  economic  union.   This  approach  has   been
                  criticised as inappropriate to  developing  countries  and
                  regions where  major  trade  barriers  often  derive  from
                  underdeveloped  production   structures   and   inadequate
                  infrastructure.   Premature  moves  to  "high"  levels  of
                  trade integration, e.g. a continent-  wide  customs  union
                  will therefore not necessarily  contribute  to  addressing
                  key challenges facing the continent.
              *   Economic regeneration of Africa requires that priority  be
                  given to development  integration,  which  is  not  solely
                  focused on conventional trade integration.   This  implies
                  combining  efforts  to  promote  trade  integration   with
                  sectoral   cooperation   in   key   infrastructural    and
                  productive  sectors.   Addressing  developmental  backlogs
                  therefore serves as  the  basis  for  promoting  effective
                  trade integration.  This  will  also  emphasise  political
                  cooperation at  an  earlier  stage  than  in  conventional
                  trade integration programmes.
              *   Tensions  exist  between  these  two  paradigms,  both  in
                  existing sub-regional programmes and in  the  Constitutive
                  Act.
              *   The terms of reference regarding the Economic, Social  and
                  Cultural  Council  (ECOSOC)  in  the  African  Union,  its
                  relationship with sub-regional  economic  bodies  and  the
                  specialised technical committees needs to be clarified.


         (b)      Economic  integration,  infrastructural  development   and
              sectoral cooperation


              *    The  case  for  a  developmental  approach  to  promoting
                  economic integration in Africa  arises  from  the  reality
                  that many  of  the  major  barriers  to  promoting  intra-
                  regional  trade  arise  not  from  tariff  and  regulatory
                  barriers but  from  underdeveloped  production  structures
                  and inadequate infrastructure.
              *   The integration strategy needs to build on what exists  in
                  sub-regions  and  should  strive   to   improve   sectoral
                  cooperation as well as capacity building  in  sub-regional
                  organisations.   Developments  such  as  the   forthcoming
                  Cotonou Economic Partnership negotiations will  underscore
                  the  need  to  develop  strategies  for  trade   relations
                  between sub-regions: options include a continental FTA  or
                  preferential agreements between sub-regions.
              *      Infrastructural     development     like     transport,
                  telecommunications and information technology may need  to
                  be prioritised.  NEPAD may be  considered  an  appropriate
                  programme in this regard.
              *   African countries have similar  trade  patterns  based  on
                  exports of primary products to the  North.   Intra-African
                  trade is  therefore  very  limited.   The  European  Union
                  envisages  reciprocal  trade  agreements  between  African
                  regions and Northern trading blocs.  These could  lead  to
                  a situation where South Africa finds  tself  trading  with
                  African countries outside the SADC region on  worse  terms
                  than e.g.  the  European  Union.   Hence,  integration  in
                  Africa  is  not  happening  in   a   vacuum:   There   are
                  developments at  global  level  that  are  re-shaping  the
                  terrain.
              *    It  may  also  be  important  to  define   the   economic
                  partnerships that are likely to benefit Africa.   Engaging
                  institutions  like  the  G7  in  order  to  maximise   the
                  benefits of globalisation also needs to be addressed.   It
                  is therefore necessary to think strategically in order  to
                  face the challenge of globalisation.
              *   It may be necessary to address the causes and consequences
                  of cross-border  migration,  particularly  of  labour  and
                  goods.


         (c)     Monetary Union


         Regarding the establishment of an African Central Bank, if this  is
         read as meaning monetary union, this may not  be  feasible  in  the
         short term given that Africa has more than 50 different  currencies
         with very unequal values.


              *   The establishment of an African Central Bank should not be
                  viewed as  an  attempt  to  prematurely  promote  monetary
                  union.
              *    Continent-wide  monetary  union  may  be   considered   a
                  legitimate long-term objective.
              *   Consideration may need to be given  to  co-operation  with
                  existing monetary union  arrangements,  such  as  that  in
                  West Africa and the common  monetary  area  between  South
                  Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia.
              *   A focus on promoting  cooperation  between  central  banks
                  similar to the Finance and Investment Sector  Coordinating
                  Unit of SADC could be a model for early activity.


              4.  Resource Considerations


              The  financial  and  human  resource  implications   of   the
              establishment  and  sustainability  of  the  AU  need  to  be
              determined.


              *   Detailed cost analyses for each organ of the AU, including
                  infrastructure,  personnel  and  operational  costs  would
                  need to be developed.
              *   Sources and sustainability of funding  would  need  to  be
                  determined.
              *   One of the reasons for the financial  constraints  of  the
                  OAU may be the inability of some member countries  to  pay
                  their membership fees. This may  be  largely  due  to  the
                  fact that member  countries  also  hold  membership  of  a
                  number of other organisations,  which  require  membership
                  fees. Article 23  of  the  AU  Constitutive  Act  aims  to
                  regulate this.


         5. Pan-African Parliament


                  To give effect to the provisions under  Article  3(g)  and
                  4(c) of the Constitutive Act,  the  establishment  of  the
                  Pan-African Parliament may need  to  be  prioritised.   To
                  this  end,  the  Presiding  Officers  could   engage   the
                  Executive to establish a role for African  Parliaments  in
                  the African Summit in July 2002.  Parliaments  would  need
                  to determine the appropriate approaches and mechanisms  to
                  foster  public  awareness  and  engagement   with   issues
                  concerning the establishment of the African Union and  the
                  implementation of the Constitutive Act.


                  In terms of the Protocol, the following  may  need  to  be
                  considered:


              *   Article 2 of the  Protocol  states  that  the  Pan-African
                  Parliament is established  by  Member  States.   This  may
                  conflict with  the  provisions  under  Article  5  of  the
                  Constitutive Act and Article 7 of the Abuja Treaty,  which
                  establish the Pan-African Parliament as one of the  organs
                  of the AU and of the OAU respectively.  Article 5  of  the
                  Constitutive Act can be considered as the legal basis  for
                  the establishment of the Pan-African Parliament.
              *   In terms of Article 4, 5 Members, at least 1 of whom  must
                  be a woman, shall represent each Member State in the  Pan-
                  African Parliament.  Compliance with  this  provision  may
                  need to be monitored since many  African  Parliaments  are
                  male dominated.
              *   Under Article  5(2),  the  Assembly  shall  determine  the
                  beginning of the first term of office of  the  Pan-African
                  Parliament.  This may impact on the  independence  of  the
                  Pan-African Parliament since the Assembly  may  delay  the
                  first sitting if it is not in the  best  interest  of  the
                  Assembly.
              *    Notwithstanding  the  provisions  under  Article   33(2),
                  consideration may need to be given as to whether the  Pan-
                  African Parliament Protocol should be  ratified  in  terms
                  of Article 7 of the Abuja Treaty  or  Article  17  of  the
                  Constitutive Act.
              *   The Protocol may need to include a provision defining  the
                  relationship  between  the  Pan-African   Parliament   and
                  national and regional Parliaments of Member States.

     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 14 May 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,  having
         considered the subject of the  KwaZulu  Cane  Growers'  Association
         Act Repeal Bill [B  48  -  2001]  (National  Assembly  -  sec  75),
         referred to it and classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism  as  a
         section 75 Bill, reports the Bill with amendments [B 48A - 2001].


         The  Committee  further  reports  that  in  the   course   of   its
         deliberations on the Bill, it  took  a  resolution  to  invite  the
         KwaZulu-Natal Cane Growers' Association and the South African  Cane
         Growers (whose membership includes members  of  the  aforementioned
         Association) to appear before the  Committee.  It  transpired  that
         there was disagreement over the balance of the money  collected  as
         levies, as well as on the purposes for which the levies were  used.
         Despite  several  attempts  to  obtain  full  information  on   the
         accumulated  assets  of  the   Association,   the   Department   of
         Agriculture did not succeed.


         The Committee  therefore  recommends  that  the  National  Assembly
         request  the  Auditor-General  to  conduct  a  full  audit  of  the
         financial books and  assets  of  the  KwaZulu-Natal  Cane  Growers'
         Association pertaining to the levies collected by  the  Association
         in terms of the KwaZulu-Cane Growers' Association  Act,  1981  (Act
         No. 12 of 1981), and that a report be presented to the House.

              (c) The back  up  support  that  is  given  to  the  financial

         Building, by the MEC  for  Sport,  Arts  and  Culture,  Mrs  Nosimo
         Balindlela, and officials of the department.


         The meeting was opened with  a  prayer,  after  which  Mr  Nkwinti,
         Director  for  Sport  in  the   Department,   also   welcomed   the
         delegation.


         The leader of the delegation, Ms Bhengu, introduced her  delegation
         and proceeded to explain the purpose of the visit.  The  delegation
         was there to:


         1. Ascertain whether provincial programmes are  in  line  with  the
              national vision.


         2. Find out if there were hindrances to the programme.


         3. Find out the progress that  has  been  made  by  the  department
              regarding the provision of sports facilities, particularly  in
              the previously disadvantaged and rural areas.


         4.  Assess  the  level   of   participation   of   the   previously
              disadvantaged people in sports codes that were known to be for

              communities.

         7. Establish the kind  of  relationship  that  exists  between  the

              the province.
         8. Find out what plans were in place  for  skills  development  and
              capacity  building  of  sport  managers,  administrators   and
              players.


         She also added  that  the  delegation  intended  to  interact  with
         communities and structures, so as to get a feel  of  the  level  of
         utilisation of the facilities and protection of facilities  by  the
         community from being vandalised.


         The delegation was then briefed by the MEC  on  activities  of  her
         department. These included:


         (a)     The second consultative meeting, which was scheduled for  9
              March 2000. The  aim  of  that  consultative  meeting  was  to
              culminate a  process  designed  to  develop  a  plan  for  the
              province.


         (b)     The Eastern Cape sports  indaba/forum  that  was  scheduled
              for 8 March 2000.


         (c)     A conference  on  sport  for  disabled  people,  which  was
              scheduled for 4 March 2000.


         The MEC went on to indicate that the province  was  represented  in
         six national events and in world events,  including  softball.  She
         also pointed out  that  although  the  Eastern  Cape  had  produced
         boxing champions, the lack of adequate boxing facilities was  still
         a problem. She also mentioned that there were  disparities  between
         sports associations and provincialisation of sports regions.


         The MEC spoke about the province's international relations and  the
         relations between  the  department  and  other  stakeholders,  i.e.
         USSASA, Eastern Cape Sports Council, PROREC, Eastern  Cape  Amateur
         Boxing Union,  and  the  Sports  Academy  in  Port  Elizabeth.  She
         indicated that the issue of the  South  African  Sports  Commission
         and its relationship with the NSC structures in the  provinces  was
         still being debated in the Eastern  Cape  province.  She  expressed
         the hope that the South African Sports Commission was going to  get
         off the ground in the near future.


         At the conclusion of the session,  the  leader  of  the  delegation
         expressed her appreciation for the  existence  of  the  study  tour
         programme and the ability  of  the  department  to  coordinate  the
         visit  and  creation  of  conditions  conducive  for  carrying  the
         programme forward.


     E.     Visits to sports facilities


         1. Debenek Sports Facility


              The delegation met with community  representatives  under  the
              leadership of Rev D D Ngcuka, at the Debenek Sports  Facility.
              Also present in the meeting was the provincial chairperson  of
              the  standing  committee  on  Sport,  Arts  and  Culture,   Mr
              Mazosiwe, and departmental officials.


              The  facility  was  built  at  Debe  Valley.  Because  of  its
              centrality, an extensive consultative process involving the 26
              surrounding communities was done prior to the building of  the
              facility. The facility  is  being  utilised  by  26  villages.
              Although the  facility  is  incomplete,  the  communities  who
              attended the meeting stated that the MEC had committed herself
              to ensuring that the facility was completed.


              The discussions in the meeting included:


              (a) The expression by  the  community  of  the  high  rate  of
                  unemployment in the area.


              (b) The lack of understanding  by  the  community  on  who  is
                  responsible for the maintenance of  the  facility  between
                  the three spheres of government, as well as the  situation
                  of   rural   areas   outside   the   boundaries   of   the
                  municipality. It was however impressing  to  observe  that
                  the community in  spite  of  very  limited  resources  was
                  actually looking after the  facility.  This  facility  was
                  the best in the province in terms of cleanliness, with  no
                  vandalism whatsoever.


              (c) The commitment made by the Border Cricket Region and other
                  codes in helping the community by cutting the grass.


              (d) The lack of co-operation by the Alice Region in as far  as
                  the usage of the facility for community events other  than
                  sport. An example of the  AIDS  day  was  made  where  the
                  Alice Region had problems in  allowing  the  community  to
                  use the facility for the AIDS education campaign.


              (e) The community praised the department of sport in Bisho for
                  its efforts in building the capacity of the community  for
                  the maintenance of the facilities.


              (f) The community expressed that the facility has  contributed
                  positively  in  making  the  youth  from  the  surrounding
                  villages  to  spend  their  time  constructively.  Mothers
                  pointed out that children who are involved in  sport  have
                  very little opportunities of getting involved in  criminal
                  activities. Women who attended the  meeting  also  praised
                  adult members of the community  who  avail  themselves  to
                  train and coach the youth in sports.
              The meeting ended with the leader of the  delegation  thanking
              the community for its warm reception and for the fact that the
              facility was not vandalised as in some  other  townships.  She
              pleaded  with  the  community  to  continue  co-operating  and
              liaising with the department and requesting the department  to
              assist where possible.


         2. Port Elizabeth Sport Academy


              The  delegation  held  an  informal  meeting  at  Holiday  Inn
              Summerstrand in Port Elizabeth with Dr R  Stretcher,  Director
              of the Sport Academy in Port Elizabeth. This academy  is  said
              to be the initiative of the University of Port Elizabeth.


              The  delegation  was  informed  that  a  delegation  from  the
              University of Port Elizabeth had visited Australia and brought
              back a model of a sport academy, which  was  approved  by  the
              NSC. The delegation was also informed that Makhaya  Ntini  and
              Mark Boucher, both cricketers from the Eastern Cape, who  were
              now playing for the national team, represented the success  of
              the sport academy.


              The problems mentioned in the meeting by Dr R  Stretcher  were
              centred on funding, which had put the development programme in
              jeopardy. One of the problems around funding was the fact that
              it was not consistent, resulting in the academy  being  unable
              to plan for programmes.


              Dr  Stretcher  informed  the  delegation   that   the   sports
              federations supplied  the  academy  with  talented  previously
              disadvantaged sports  persons.  It  was  also  mentioned  that
              sports development progammes of the academy were intensive and
              residential. Fees for trainees with a disadvantaged background
              were absorbed by the sports academy.


              On the following day, the delegation held a meeting  with  the
              representatives of the  provincial  2006  Bid  Committee,  the
              Sports Council, the NSC and USSASA. Issues  of  discussion  in
              this meeting was sports in general including:


              (a) The 2006 Bid, particularly the support of the bid  in  the
                  province.


              (b) The Sport Academy, particularly the supply of trainees  to
                  the academy and the impact of the academy on the issue  of
                  skills development as well  as  the  relationship  between
                  the sports federations and the Sport Academy.


              (c)  The  relationship  between  the  sports  bodies  and  the
                  provincial department of sport.


              In this meeting the Sports Council addressed the thorny  issue
              of the Sport Academy and the commercialisation of  sport.  The
              council called for a review of how the academy  was  run.  The
              council also pointed out  that  insufficient  funding  of  the
              Sports Academy was creating a problem for the  Sports  Academy
              not to reach out to the intended target group  of  development
              programmes. The Sports Council representatives went on to  say
              that most of the trainees in the Sports Academy were those who
              could afford to pay.


              The situation presented was that the  objectives  of  building
              the capacity and the development of skills of  the  previously
              disadvantaged people could not be realised under  the  current
              situation within the Sport Academy.


              The Committee was urged  to  intervene,  particularly  on  the
              issue of selection panels for channeling  the  talented  sport
              people to the  Sport  Academy.  It  was  also  argued  by  the
              representatives of sports federations  that  the  municipality
              should not charge exorbitant funds to  local  clubs,  who  are
              financially weak, for the use of facilities.  This  issue  was
              mentioned within  the  context  of  making  sports  facilities
              accessible to communities.


              The delegation identified that some of the  issues  raised  in
              the meeting were actually related to  a  lack  of  coordinated
              efforts by different stakeholders around sports  issues.  Most
              of the issues raised did not need intervention  by  structures
              outside the region.  The  meeting  was  then  advised  by  the
              delegation to open channels of communication between different
              sports bodies and with the government departments dealing with
              sports, including the local government.


              The delegation however promised to  raise  the  issue  of  the
              sport academy with the MEC for Sport,  Arts  and  Culture  and
              also with  the  South  African  Sports  Commission,  once  the
              Commission is up and running. This was going  to  be  done  in
              order to ensure that the objectives of the Sports Academy  are
              actually realised.


              The delegation felt that the whole Portfolio  Committee  would
              need a special session with the Chief Executive Officer of the
              South African Sports Commission  where  the  issue  of  Sports
              Academies would be discussed. Included in the discussion would
              be:
              *   The target group for the existing academies.


              *   The funding for the academies.


              *    The  involvement  of  local  sports  structure  and   the
                  community within which the academy is located.


              *   The impact made by the sport academies in as far as skills
                  development and breeding of competent  sports  people  are
                  concerned.


              The issue of lack of support by the Department of Education in
              relation to school sport was raised. One of  the  concerns  on
              this issue was the problem of not knowing which department  is
              the custodian of school sport between the Department of Sport,
              Art and  Culture  and  the  Department  of  Education.  USSASA
              mentioned that the current situation leaves USSASA not knowing
              which of the two departments should be approached for problems
              affecting school sports.
              The leader of the delegation reported to the meeting that  the
              Portfolio Committee was planning to invite the  national  body
              of USSASA to brief the Portfolio Committee on  the  programmes
              of USSASA and problems that are  experienced  by  USSASA.  She
              then informed the meeting that the Portfolio  Committee  would
              then analise the information presented by the national body of
              USSASA against the information gathered during study tours  to
              various   provinces.   The   Committee   would    then    make
              recommendations  to  the  national  Department  of  Sport  and
              Recreation and also to the relevant sports bodies.


              The meeting ended with the leader of the delegation responding
              to issues raised and addressing the meeting on the legislation
              which were in the pipeline, including what  those  legislation
              aimed to address.


              The meeting was asked by the leader of the delegation to  look
              on the  issue  of  establishing  exchange  programmes  between
              provinces for the purpose of learning from  one  another.  She
              mentioned that it is not only the foreign countries that could
              provide us with answers to our problems, some answers could be
              found from other provinces in South Africa  as  weaknesses  of
              one province could be the strengths of another province.


         3. Kariga (in Port Alfred near Grahamstown)


              On Saturday the delegation visited  the  Kariga  Game  Reserve
              where a workshop on sport for the disabled  people  was  held.
              The MEC for Sport, Arts and Culture  together  with  officials
              from her department were part of the workshop. It became clear
              to the delegation as to why this workshop was held  in  Kariga
              Game Reserve, as the facility was accessible to the  disabled,
              more especially those who were physically challenged.


              The delegation did not stay long in the workshop to understand
              issues  that  were  being  discussed  at  the  workshop.   The
              delegation was however satisfied by the fact that Eastern Cape
              was taking  sports  for  disabled  people  seriously  and  was
              engaging  the  disabled  people  as   full   participants   in
              workshops. This was seen as a very important aspect of  making
              sport accessible to all. What was also  remarkable  about  the
              workshop  was  that  the  disabled  people  were  representing
              themselves, unlike the usual trend where those affected by the
              problem would be represented by people who would speak from  a
              perceived need instead of a felt need.


              This was seen by the  delegation  as  a  strength  that  other
              provinces could learn from.


              The leader  of  the  delegation  addressed  the  workshop  and
              expressed the joy of the delegation related to  the  workshop.
              She also encouraged the participants to claim  their  rightful
              positions as equal partners in the society. She also mentioned
              that the President of the country, Mr Thabo Mbeki, was  taking
              the needs of the disabled people  seriously.  The  sports  for
              disabled people were a special project to the  President,  and
              therefore all of us have no other choice but to make sure that
              it becomes a success. The delegation then left for Umtata.


         4. Botha Sigcawu Building


              The delegation was received and welcomed by Mr Tambodala,  the
              acting regional head of the  Department  of  Sport,  Arts  and
              Culture.  Mr  Tambodala  introduced  the  officials   of   the
              department, and then gave a  brief  overview  of  the  sports-
              related activities of  the  department.  In  his  briefing  he
              mentioned that the region was made of eight  districts,  which
              included nine magisterial districts, meaning that  the  region
              was very big.


              After a briefing by  the  leader  of  the  delegation  on  the
              purpose of the visit and areas  of  focus,  officials  of  the
              department told the delegation that  there  were  basic  sport
              facilities at eMqanduli, eNgqeleni  and  KuTsolo,  which  were
              semi-complete. It was also mentioned that these facilities did
              not have ablution blocks, ticket rooms, security  offices  and
              proper grass. It was reported that there was co-operation with
              relevant transitional rural councils. It  was  also  mentioned
              that there was a facility earmarked for eNgcobo, but that  the
              facility had not been built yet, due to a lack  of  funds  for
              the provision of sport facilities in that financial year.


              Satellite sport academies that are based at Unitra, Fort  Hare
              and  Border  Technikon  were  alluded  to,  though   community
              linkages with these was academies was seen to be not as  sound
              as supposed to be.


              It was however acknowledged that despite structural  problems,
              the relations between the academies  and  some  of  the  sport
              codes - boxing, netball  and  athletics  -  were  said  to  be
              cordial. Money was said to be the main inhibitor  for  use  of
              academy facilities by the intended target group.


              The Committee concluded the session with  an  indication  that
              the visit was not the last one to the province. The leader  of
              the delegation highlighted the legislation that  were  on  the
              pipeline and how those legislation  relate  to  the  situation
              that is found on the ground regarding sport issues.


              The delegation then split into two, the  one  group  going  to
              eNgqeleni and the other to kuTsolo.


         5. Ngqeleni


              The group of the delegation visited a sport facility, which is
              at eNgqeleni and was met by Mr L  Debwa,  a  local  government
              councillor. The facility was in  clean  condition  with  short
              grass. The grass was however not the lawn type  of  grass  and
              therefore not suitable for a sports field. The ground  retains
              water, thereby making it impossible to use the facility for  a
              few days after the rain.  The  RDP  and  the  Premier  jointly
              funded the building of the facility.


              This facility is a multi-purpose facility that could  be  used
              for  soccer  and  rugby.  It  is  however  not  suitable   for
              athletics, hockey and other similar sports,  because  of  this
              type of grass.


              It would be recommended that a suitable  type  be  planted  in
              this facility so as to make it accessible to quite a number of
              sports codes.


         6. KuTsolo


              The local government councillors and members of the  community
              met the group that visited a sports facility at  KuTsolo.  The
              facility was seen to be clean and well looked after and  there
              were no incidents of vandalism. The facility  was  incomplete.
              It was reported to the delegation by the local community  that
              the local youth and local  clubs  utilise  the  facility.  The
              community valued the facility very highly, linking it  to  the
              constructive engagement of youth.


         7. Idutywa


              The delegation made a brief stopover at a facility in  Idutywa
              to see a rugby match between Abahlobo and Comrades, two  local
              teams who were playing to celebrate  a  sponsorship  from  DMJ
              Transport  Services.  The  sponsorship  was  in  the  form  of
              jerseys, track suits, kit bags, and golf T-shirts to Abahlobo.




              The delegation also went to  a  nearby  sport  facility  where
              there was a soccer match played by other two local teams.  The
              facility on which the soccer match was being played, was huge.
              It was however disappointing to witness that this facility was
              not well looked after. The grass was very tall.  Change  rooms
              and toilets were very dirty.  It  was  even  difficult  to  go
              nearer to the pitch because of tall grass.


              It was however remarkable impressive to see the high level  of
              sports activities that were  taking  place  in  the  province.
              There were sports activities in each  and  every  village  the
              delegation passed through. There  were  sports  activities  in
              almost all the facilities the delegation passed through.


         8. Park Side Sports Field in Buffalo Flats


              The delegation visited a sport facility in  Park  Side,  which
              hosted the head quarters of the East London Rugby  Union.  The
              facility was previously  maintained  by  the  old  structures,
              which were racially based - the CMCs. The delegation was  then
              informed that  the  facility  was  now  under  the  Parks  and
              Amenities division of the East  London  municipality.  It  was
              also reported that there was a plan to upgrade the facility at
              a cost of R800 000. The upgrading would include the  extension
              of the field and the provision  of  floodlights  to  make  the
              facility usable at night.


              The problems that  were  mentioned  was  that  the  facility's
              change rooms were not usable due to lack  of  maintenance.  It
              was also mentioned that the facility was over-utilised to  the
              point that school children from a nearby school were only able
              to make use the facility  during  school  hours,  other  times
              being reserved for local clubs.


         9. Schoeman Sports Ground in Buffalo Flats


              This facility was in an impeccable condition. It was  reported
              to the delegation that the East London municipality maintained
              it. The facility had clean change rooms  and  floodlights.  It
              was said that Border  Cricket  used  the  facility  for  their
              development programme.


         10.     Duncan Village


              The delegation visited Lujiza Primary School in Duncan Village
              to  see  a  Presidential  Project  that  is  a   multi-purpose
              facility. It was reported that two schools use  the  facility,
              as the facility is located between them. This facility was  in
              good condition with no vandalism.


         11.     Orlando Stadium in Mdatsane


              This facility is located behind Sisa Dukashe Stadium. It is  a
              massive facility with three netball courts, six tennis courts,
              a clubhouse,  the  caretaker's  house,  a  practice  wall  for
              tennis, and a pump house for an  Olympic-size  swimming  pool,
              change rooms and toilets. The sad thing about this facility is
              that it stands derelict and is being vandalised.


         12.     Sisa Dukashe Stadium


              This is a complete facility, which is used mostly for  soccer.
              This facility is suitable for other codes as well. It is  also
              used for open-air boxing tournaments.


              The problem highlighted there was over-usage of the  facility.
              The delegation was also informed  that  there  were  plans  to
              enlarge the stand  but  problems  were  being  encountered  in
              raising the funds.


              The Committee recommends that, whatever plans exist  that  are
              related to enlarging this facility, such plans  should  viewed
              against the conditions of both the Orlando  Stadium  and  Sisa
              Dukashe stadium so as to arrive at a decision that would avoid
              duplication,  waste  of  limited  resources  and  maintenance-
              related challenges to local municipalities.


         13.     High Way Indoor Facility


              The delegation visited a multi purpose indoor facility,  which
              was built from funds donated  by  Sun  International  and  the
              Sports Trust. It was reported that the facility was  used  for
              volleyball, karate, aerobics and other  social  activities  of
              the  community.  The  facility  was  also  in  an   impeccable
              condition.


              The delegation then drove to Bisho for  a  debriefing  session
              with the department of Sport, Arts and Culture. The  MEC,  Mrs
              Nosimo  Balindlela,  at  her  office,   again   received   the
              delegation. The leader of the delegation shared with  the  MEC
              and officials from  the  department  the  experiences  of  the
              delegation  during  the  study  tour.  Issues  raised  by  the
              communities  particularly  around  the  sport   academy,   the
              custodian department for school sport  were  reported  to  the
              MEC.


              The leader of the delegation expressed the appreciation of the
              delegation for the manner in which the delegation was  treated
              by the MEC and officials of  the  department.  The  fact  that
              there were sports activities in almost all villages  was  also
              appreciated. The leader of the  delegation  pointed  out  that
              there seemed to be problems around the staff complement of the
              department, which could be attributed to  the  fact  that  the
              provincial  department  absorbed  two  structures  with  their
              entire staff, namely the former Ciskei  and  former  Transkei.
              The leader of the delegation asked the  MEC  to  look  at  the
              staff  structure  to  see  whether  there  was  a   need   for
              maintaining it.


     F.     Overall observation


         The Department Sport, Arts and Culture absorbed all the staff  from
         the  former  Ciskei  and  Transkei   departments;   therefore   the
         delegation recommends that a staff audit should be  done  in  order
         to assess what staff positions should be kept in future.


     G.     Conclusion


         The MEC was seen to be on top of sports  issues  and  had  a  clear
         plan of action. Eastern Cape  had  demonstrated  to  the  whole  of
         South  Africa  that  given  the  opportunity,   people   from   the
         disadvantaged communities are capable of  excelling  in  any  sport
         code. This was more visible on the level of  participation  of  the
         black people, particularly in rugby and cricket. The  Eastern  Cape
         was  also   acknowledged   for   its   performance   in   producing
         professional champions in boxing.


         It is recommended that the MEC meet  with  the  sports  federations
         and the NSC to begin with the process of ensuring  that  the  sport
         academy in Port Elizabeth  works  towards  the  attainment  of  the
         initial objectives.
