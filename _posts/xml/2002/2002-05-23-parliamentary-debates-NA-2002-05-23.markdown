                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the recent  visit  to  this  country  by  a  group  of  Israeli
       conscientious objectors who are reserve combat officers and  soldiers
       in the Israeli defence force;


  (2) further notes that these trained combatants  are  willing  to  defend
       Israeli territory but refuse to participate in missions of occupation
       and oppression in the occupied territories, and have  declared  their
       refusal to ``fight beyond the 1967  borders  in  order  to  dominate,
       expel, starve and humiliate an entire people'';


  (3) applauds the courage and integrity of these objectors  and  expresses
       its solidarity with their laudable stand; and


  (4) calls on the Israeli government to -


       (a)  recognise the right of conscientious objection;


       (b)  withdraw immediately from the occupied territories in accordance
           with UN resolutions; and


       (c)  resume negotiations in good faith with the Palestinian Authority
           in order to establish  an  independent  and  viable  Palestinian
           state, co-existing in  peace  with  an  independent  and  secure
           Israeli state.
[Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister for Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
       accused  Archbishop  Tutu  of  hypocrisy  and  used  the  shelter  of
       parliamentary privilege to do so;


  (2) further notes that he did so to avoid taking responsibility  for  the
       political favouritism displayed by the latest series of  presidential
       pardons;


  (3) recognises that -


       (a)  the TRC process was designed to  expose  and  thereby  heal  the
           wounds of our divided past; and


       (b)  it did so at great emotional and financial cost to  our  nation;
           and


  (4) therefore regrets that President Mbeki chose to negate  this  healing
       process by ignoring the  TRC  and  pardoning  brutal  killers  simply
       because of their political allegiances.
[Interjections.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 17 persons were recently arrested in Gauteng for allegedly
       defrauding the Road Accident Fund;


  (2) further notes that the Minister of Transport has announced that about
       25% of RAF claims were fraudulent, amounting to some R300 million per
       year; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of  Transport  to  accelerate  immediately  the
       process of reform that has been under way at the RAF for the last two
       years or longer.

Mr T M GONIWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the President of the Republic of  South  Africa,  the  hon
       Thabo Mbeki, called for a ``new worker'' who must also concentrate on
       the collective good of the nation, the continent and the world;


  (2) believes that whilst it is important for the organised working  class
       to take up shop floor issues, it is imperative that they  participate
       actively in the process of social change as they benefit from it; and


  (3) reiterates President Thabo Mbeki's call for the organised workers  to
       embrace the spirit of new patriotism and be part of the processes  of
       transformation.
[Applause.]

Mr D M BAKKER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the shocking revelations by  Mr  Jurgen  Harksen  at  the  Desai
           commission hearing, detailing regular meetings and donations  of
           more than R785 000 to the DA;


       (b)  Mr Harksen stating that their friendship got deeper  and  deeper
           and more expensive;


       (c)  that, contrary to his testimony yesterday, Mr Hennie Bester  was
           present in a meeting with Mr Harksen and thanked Mr Harksen  for
           arranging financial assistance for the DA; and


       (d)  that Mr Bester had phoned the hon Mr Leon in the presence of  Mr
           Harksen and others, and informed him of Mr Harksen's involvement
           and generosity; and


  (2) calls on -


       (a)  the hon Mr Leon and Mr Bester to come  clean  and  to  apply  to
           themselves and the DA the advice that they so  readily  give  to
           others; and


       (b)  the DP/DA to suspend the hon Mr Leon until the  full  extent  of
           his involvement has been established.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I will move on behalf  of
the UDM at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  with  appreciation  the  effort  known  as  the  Trans-Limpopo
       Corridor Spatial Development Initiative, which is intended  to  be  a
       model for the rest of the African continent;


  (2) recognises that this initiative by  the  Limpopo  province  of  South
       Africa  and  the  Zimbabwean   provinces   of   Matabeleland   South,
       Matabeleland North, the city of Bulawayo,  and  the  Kruger  National
       Park will harness the concept of the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
       Development;


  (3) however, expresses its concern  and  alarm  at  the  pulling  out  of
       President Mugabe and Zanu-PF  from  the  reconciliatory  talks  which
       would bring to an end the  political  crisis  in  Zimbabwe  and  thus
       create a conducive atmosphere and environment for both Nepad and  the
       Trans-Limpopo Corridor Spatial Development Initiative; and


  (4) calls on President Mugabe and Zanu-PF  to  yield  to  the  diplomatic
       request for rejoining the reconciliatory dialogue with the MDC.
[Applause.]

Ms M A MOLEBATSI: Madam Speaker, on the next sitting day  of  the  House,  I
shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 12-year-old Leonard Mmokwa is fighting  for  his  life  on
       life support at GaRankuwa Hospital after he was run over by a tractor
       while employed for R5 a day on a farm at Sikataatsnek, Brits, in  the
       North West province;


  (2) believes that the continued employment and exploitation  of  children
       for labour deprives children of a decent future,  their  freedom  and
       proper education;


  (3) wishes Leonard Mmokwa a speedy recovery;


  (4) appreciates the support that another farmer, Manie Maritz,  his  wife
       Marita and Miss Daleen van Manen have given the Mmokwa family;


  (5) pledges to intensify  its  efforts  to  eradicate  child  labour  and
       exploitation of farm workers; and


  (6) calls on the relevant authorities to investigate the  matter  and  to
       prosecute.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation that -


       (a)  Volunteer South Africa in co-operation with  the  Department  of
           Social Development held its Volunteer Vision Regional Conference
           on 16 and 17 May 2002 in Johannesburg;


       (b)  the regional conference was attended by delegates  from  several
           SADC   countries   including   Botswana,   Lesotho,   Swaziland,
           Mozambique and others;


       (c)  several South African nonprofit organisations such as SASVO, Via
           Africa, Nacoss and the National  Nutritional  Support  Programme
           (NNSP) among others, attended this conference; and


       (d)  the volunteer medium needs to be strengthened and  harnessed  to
           address the socioeconomic challenges such as  poverty,  HIV/Aids
           and the plight of children, the unemployed and the homeless;


  (2) recognises -


       (a)  that the  reciprocity  of  volunteering  and  volunteer  actions
           benefit the individual and society at large;


       (b)  the contribution of volunteering in the national  GDP,  and  its
           role in the creation of social cohesion and capital; and


       (c)   that  Government,  the  private  sector,  international   donor
           organisations  and  civil  society  have   an   individual   and
           collective responsibility to contribute to volunteering; and


  (3) therefore resolves that -


       (a)  all tiers of Government should lend support to volunteer  action
           and  create  an  enabling   and   favourable   environment   for
           volunteering through  proactive  policies  and  legislation,  to
           encourage  research  on   volunteering   service,   to   support
           infrastructures and to promote public sector volunteering; and


       (b)  all members of Parliament avail themselves to do volunteer  work
           during the constituency period.
[Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with concern that -


       (a)  a period for belt tightening has fallen on us as a nation as the
           financial well dries up by degrees;


       (b)  revenue earned by  provinces  from  gambling,  horse-racing  and
           lottery has fallen over the years; and


       (c)  provinces that relied heavily on the proceeds of gambling houses
           for their revenue will face an uncertain future; and


  (2) takes into cognisance that this is an indication to the Government to
       be prepared for the worst, as hunger, joblessness, crime and  poverty
       will escalate as money grows scarcer and scarcer.

Prof S S RIPINGA: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of  Education,  Mr  Kader  Asmal,  signed  an
       agreement on Tuesday with Microsoft for 32 000 state schools  to  get
       Microsoft software for free;


  (2) further notes that it is  estimated  that  the  deal  will  save  the
       Government up to R100 million annually and will provide a significant
       boost to the Department of  Education's  plan  to  have  every  state
       school connected to the Internet by 2002;


  (3) believes that this reflects the commitment of the ANC  Government  to
       building a nonracial, nonsexist and dynamic  education  system  which
       responds to the development needs of a growing economy and a changing
       society; and


  (4) welcomes  the  signing  of  this  agreement  as  it  will  contribute
       positively to social development.
[Applause.]
Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with approval the remarks by President Mbeki when he criticised
       local and provincial government institutions  for  their  failure  to
       deliver services, in particular his reference  to  the  Eastern  Cape
       provincial government;


  (2)  further  notes  that  the  ANC  is  fond  of  blaming  institutional
       incapacity for their failures but appears to do little to help create
       the capacity needed for delivery; and


  (3) reminds the ANC that in a democracy the voters are unforgiving when a
       government, at any level, fails to deliver.
[Applause.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates our national soccer team on their  last  two  victories
       over Madagascar and Scotland in preparation for the Soccer World Cup;


  (2) notes with pride that Bafana Bafana's buildup to  the  World  Cup  in
       Korea and Japan has been very successful thus far;


  (3) believes that Bafana Bafana will -


       (a)  play to the best of their ability and make the people  of  South
           Africa proud; and


       (b)  prove the many prophets of doom  wrong  during  the  forthcoming
           World Cup.
[Applause.]
Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that many South Africans live on or under the breadline, whilst
       unemployment is high, especially amongst women and the youth;


  (2) recognises that a food security system for South Africa may take  the
       form of a food parcel system such as and where -


       (a)  the Department of Health determines the nutritional content of a
           food parcel;


       (b)  supermarkets tender for the distribution and  administration  of
           food parcels, ensuring that the best quality and the best  price
           is achieved;


       (c)  people who qualify are issued with rechargeable cards, to obtain
           food on a monthly basis;


       (d)   the  system  is  phased  in,  starting  with  the  elderly  and
           female/child  heads  of  households,  and  later   extended   to
           registered unemployed people or low-paid youths; and


  (3) commits itself to actively campaign in the coming  months  to  ensure
       that this, or  any  other  reasonable  and  responsible  strategy  is
       implemented to ensure that all South Africans have the basic means to
       become productive contributors to our society and economy.

Mr B M KOMPHELA: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Transnet has issued one of  the  largest  freight  railway
       tenders in the continent to upgrade its ageing locomotive  and  wagon
       fleet in a deal worth R15 billion over 15 years;


  (2) believes that the latest move by Spoornet will contribute  positively
       to the  improvement,  accessibility  and  efficiency  in  the  public
       transport system;


  (3) further believes  that  the  improvement  of  public  transport  will
       contribute positively towards the improvement of the quality of  life
       of our people; and


  (4) welcomes the plans by Transnet to upgrade its  locomotive  and  wagon
       fleet.
[Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I  will  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the hon Mr Tony Leon insisted that Mr Peter Marais, when he  was
           still  Mayor  of  Cape  Town,  be  sent  on  leave  pending   an
           investigation into the allegations surrounding Mr  Marais  then;
           and yet


       (b)  it was the hon Mr Leon's so-called  political  judgment  at  the
           time that Mr Peter Marais was not fit to be mayor;


  (2) calls -


       (a)  on the DA to contact Judge Heath  urgently  to  investigate  the

       Leader of the Official Opposition until  the  revelations  have  been
       fully investigated; and

       investigation.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 10 - Public Service  and  Administration;  Vote  No  11  -
Public Service Commission; and  Vote  No  12  -  SA  Management  Development
Institute:

The MINISTER FOR THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Madam  Speaker,
colleagues, hon members of this House, union  leaders  who  are  up  in  the
gallery and various observers from various  sectors  of  society  -  public,
private and the community sector - the Public Service is changing.
Eight years since the first democratic Government took power we can see  the
signs of constitutional change. Our organs of state  are  representative  of
our people and, therefore, more effective in addressing a diverse  range  of
needs. Our structures and systems are being modernised in order  to  provide
a better service. Our public servants are  grappling  with  translating  the
spirit of Batho Pele and Vukuzenzele in their everyday practices.

The transformation is not made easier, given the fact that we  govern  in  a
context full of complexities and contradictions.  Massive  service  delivery
challenges remain. Our organisational  structures  and  operational  systems
can still be more effective and efficient. Our public servants are  not  all
equipped with the competencies required to be fully effective. We are  still
growing, adapting and learning, but, most importantly, we are changing.  The
Public Service is changing.

The theme ``We are changing'' opened a  polemic  within  me.  In  the  first
instance, the one thing in life that is certain is  change.  So  it  is  not
special when all we can report is  that  the  Public  Service  is  changing.
Change in the Public Service can only be meaningful if it is for the  better
of the people. Therefore, this input to this Parliament  today  is:  We  are
changing for the better of the people.

This particular Budget Vote is also dedicated to a special leader and  group
of  leaders   and   Isithwalandwe   (Seaparankoe),   Tata   Walter   Sisulu.
[Interjections.] This Budget Vote is dedicated to  him  and  that  group  of
leaders.

I want to remind hon members that the  President,  in  his  tribute  in  ANC
Today to Tata Sisulu on his 90th  birthday  celebration  last  week,  penned
some thoughts that I believe are of the utmost pertinence to  the  challenge
that we are  facing  in  transforming  the  Public  Service.  The  President
commented on women and men who chose to dedicate their lives to the  service
of the people, describing them as heroes and heroines, and he elaborated  as
follows on them, and I quote:


  They were prepared to sacrifice everything so long this was necessary for
  the betterment of the condition of the people. They were  ready  thus  to
  act, not to earn any praise or to receive any material reward. They acted
  to satisfy their consciences, that they had done all they could to  serve
  the people of our country.

I could not but wonder, when looking at the  Public  Service  today:  Do  we
have, at this point, in the mould of this Public Service, men and women  who
are ready to do what is necessary for the betterment  of  the  condition  of
our people? I believe that we will be able to reflect and see who and  where
they are, those who are the heroes and heroines, who are  ready  to  engage,
proactively and productively, in the reconstruction  and  transformation  of
the Public Service to ensure more effective service delivery.

Our Government recently passed its halfway mark since  coming  to  power  in
June 1999. It is therefore an appropriate  time  to  reflect  on  what  this
Ministry has achieved. We have the broad  range  that  is  covered  by  this
Budget Vote - the Department of Public Service and  Administration;  the  SA
Management Development Institute; the State Information  Technology  Agency;
the  Centre  for  Public  Service  Innovation;  and   the   Public   Service
Commission,  a  body,  in  terms  of  the  constitutional  provision,  which
reports, in its own right, directly to Parliament on its work.

In his state of the nation address our President called on our  people,  the
people of  this  country,  to  arise  and  act  in  the  people's  campaign,
Vukuzenzele. This has proved an excellent way  for  the  leadership  of  the
Public Service  to  remain  in  touch  with  the  people  and  the  material
conditions that constitute their greatest challenge.  Public  servants  have
risen to this challenge and extended their hand to  fellow  public  servants
and fellow citizens, and I have seen in my Ministry teams lending a hand  in
the spirit of Letsema. The effect has been phenomenal.

Firstly,  people  who  are  accessing  Government  services  experience  the
difference. Secondly, in our own team's report I  see  a  renewed  sense  of
passion for the work they do and a greater sense of how  the  backroom  work
that they perform in an ordinary day translates into  practice.  Thirdly,  I
have witnessed what it does to the team spirit and  camaraderie  where  work
is done together in this way.

Traditional divisions are often cited as  obstacles  to  delivery,  such  as
organisational  and  structural  divisions  between  distinct   departments,
organisations and various institutions at  national,  provincial  and  local
levels, as well as various sectors of society. for example, public,  private
and community sectors fade in  the  face  of  the  challenge  of  performing
better  and  creating  improved  physical  circumstances  in  which   public
services can be rendered.

In Peddie in the Eastern Cape we concentrated on the registration  drive  to
improve the uptake of child support grants. In true Batho Pele  spirit,  the
Public Administration  team,  together  with  public  servants  from  Social
Development and Home  Affairs,  set  up  an  operation  on  the  grounds  of
Ngqushwa Municipality Town Hall. A  process  of  registering  child  support
grants was embarked upon, allowing children without  birth  certificates  to
apply for and be issued with their  certificates.  This  drive  lasted  over
three days, and we noted how this  process  had  an  amazing  24-hour  turn-
around result.

Earlier this month 45 members of the team spent a total of 16 hours  each  -
this included members from Samdi, Sita and DPSA -  cleaning,  gardening  and
painting, as well as decorating a police station, a women's  shelter  and  a
hospital to make a tangible difference to continued service delivery in  the
Alex Township. The private sector generously  sponsored  material  for  this
event and we appreciate their contribution.

This morning Samdi officials  went  to  Bishop  Lavis  Police  Station,  and
assisted in capturing  the  backlog  of  police  records  electronically  to
ensure the better functioning of the criminal justice system  through  their
input at that specific police station. Why mention these actions within  the
bigger picture? It is a sign that there are public servants  who  say  that,
over and above the normal call of duty, they will walk that extra  mile,  in
the spirit of what is required where we break down undue divisions.

The marvel of these activities is that they give  rise  to  further  action,
which is directly in response to express needs from the broader populace  in
our country. Our visit to Peddie has already  resulted  in  both  Samdi  and
Sita assisting two schools in the area to become  fully  computer  literate.
These schools are the  Marambana  Commercial  High  School  and  the  Knight
Matomela Senior Secondary School. I believe the principals are somewhere  in
the gallery this afternoon.

On Monday 20 May 2002, 20 computers were sent to Marambane and Sita  support
technicians will assist with the installation. These computers are  part  of
the package of a total of 2  500  that  will  be  made  available  to  needy
schools free of charge, in terms of the  public-private-partnership  that  I
will be elaborating on within minutes. Also, what should  be  said  is  that
today two trainers are in the  area  kickstarting  the  Train  the  Trainers
Course for both schools.

We are absolutely convinced of the fact that the information  and  community
technology provides an essential mechanism through which the performance  of
any modern organisation can be improved.  If  correctly  deployed,  ICT  can
become  prized  artillery  in  the  fight  against  poverty,  and  that  was
reflected in the earlier  motion  that  was  read,  and  that  applauded  my
colleague Minister Asmal. We will use this as part of the artillery to  take
efficiency forward and to extend certain boundaries.

Two  days  ago,  speaking  at  the  second  Fedusa  National  Congress,  the
President underlined this fact, stating:


  All of us will agree that  one  of  the  primary  challenges  facing  the
  working  people  is  the  technological  revolution,  an  entry  to   the
  information age, ensuring a  smooth  ride  on  the  information  highway,
  without falling by the wayside.

This is a one of the primary challenges facing our working people.

The sad reality is that ICT literacy  levels  of  public  servants  and  the
current patterns of access to computers confirm our biggest  concerns  about
the effect of the advanced  technologies  on  societies  and  organisations.
Notwithstanding the fact that Government spends over R3  billion  per  annum
on ICT goods and services, only 20% of  our  workforce  are  PC  users.  Our
concern is that instead of being an  equaliser  and  a  developmental  tool,
technology could contribute to even further  and  deeper  divisions  in  our
society, and hence we thought we proactively need to move  to  overcome  it.
We must do this in the Public Service.

It is against this background that Cabinet, in  April  this  year,  approved
the implementation of two very  exciting  projects  in  the  Public  Service
realm that will have a strong ripple effect across society.  These  are  the
Golaganang project, and the related Walk-in Training  Centres  project.  The
origin of Golaganang can be found in the public  service  presidential  task
force on ICT that met late last year, where our President  Mbeki  posed  the
challenge to private sector partners involved in  the  task  force  to  come
forward with innovative mechanisms, through which to  address  the  specific
challenges facing Southern Africa, in terms of  ensuring  proper  dispersion
of ICT to communities.

In response to  this  challenge,  Hewlett-Packard,  together  with  selected
partners such as Telkom,  Microsoft  and  CS  Holdings,  came  up  with  the
concept of assembling a  technology  bundle  that  can  be  sold  to  public
servants at an affordable price, with a subsidy from Government. The  bundle
will include the provision of basic computer  training  to  public  servants
and three of their family members.

We hope that others in the ICT community will  seize  this  opportunity  and
also come forward with innovative ideas that will contribute to the  closing
of the ICT chasm. My colleague the Minister of Communications, Ivy  Matsepe-
Casaburri, members would have heard, was applauding solely earlier,  because
she has been pushing this very hard. We want to  close  the  divide  at  all
levels,  and  the  Public  Service  is  going  to  lead  in  this  instance.
[Applause.]

What exactly is the content of the Golaganang  offer?  Government  employees
are given the opportunity to purchase a computer package that consists of  a
personal computer with a 15-inch monitor  and  built-in  modem,  a  Hewlett-
Packard computer, a colour printer, two  free-standing  speakers,  Microsoft
Office software applications and Microsoft Windows Step-by-step  interactive
training software, and then Internet connectivity provided by Telkom.  There
will be free installation and an extended service warranty for three  years.
There will be three hours basic computer training for the buyer  plus  three
of her - and I want to emphasise ``her'' - and his family members.

It will include skills-enhancing computer-based programmes on  PC  literacy,
and then, of course, we look at banking facilities that are being  provided.
The total cost of the package will be charged through  instalments  of  R430
per month over a period of 36  months.  However,  this  project  includes  a
Government subsidy  that  progressively  favours  lower-paid  employees.  In
effect this means that Public Service employees earning less  than  R12  499
per month will be able to access the above package for as little as R99  per
month,  and  we  will  target  the  lower  levels  of  the  Public   Service
deliberately and consciously. [Applause.]

The roll-out plans  will  further  ensure  that  project  is  favourable  to
specific groups. Those who have access to technology  must  have  a  greater
impact on society. So, to the women and mothers  who  are  public  servants,
``apply, and make sure you are on board''. The Ministers  will  ensure  that
this does happen.
I want to go forward and say that  governments  may  generally  be  slow  in
seizing  opportunities  that  result  from  advances  made   in   technology
development, and tend to be conservative in exploiting the new choices  that
are opening up to them. As a Government, and as a team,  we  have  tried  to
overcome this reticence. We are now moving to a situation where we  want  to
integrate existing initiatives and build on the  experience  that  has  been
developed. Through the  integration  and  co-ordination  work  that  we  are
doing, through the governance  and  administration  cluster,  in  initiating
South Africa online, which will begin to bear  fruit  later  this  year,  we
would like to ensure  a  single  electronic  gateway  that  will  facilitate
information about, and services provided by, Government.

The overall vision of Gateway, as it is  known,  is  to  provide  access  to
Government services at any time and any place, within a clearly defined  and
executed e-government service.  Access  to  services  is  at  the  heart  of
Gateway. Through  the  creative  use  of  the  electronic  enablers,  mobile
service units and fixed-service delivery sites, we hope that  it  will  mean
an end to  providing  the  same  information  over  and  over  to  different
agencies of the state.  Once  given,  all  records  will  automatically  and
regularly be updated. This is the future that we are busy creating  for  our
people. I would like to remind the hon members that some of the  people  who
are going to lead this work are sitting on my right,  in  the  bay  reserved
for departmental officials, and others are sitting up there  in  the  public
gallery. With this commitment to this Parliament and this nation,  the  work
must be done as is required to take it forward.

We believe that projects such as those that I have outlined  here,  and  all
other Public Service delivery through all other  departments  and  agencies,
can only happen in  the  most  effective  way  if  we  pursue  the  internal
transformation processes that have been set in motion. The challenge  is  to
create a Public Service organisation that is capable,  ethical,  modern  and
an employer of choice that is continually learning and improving.

How are we progressing in order to create this Public Service? The  make  or
break in a successful Public Service administration capable of  leading  the
fight against poverty are ability and capacity. These two  factors  are  key
in determining performance. For this  reason,  the  bulk  of  activities  in
which  we  are  involved  somehow  relate  to  capacity  development.  Human
resource development is the key. During the week of  15  to  19  April  this
year - and I briefly referred to this earlier on -  we  launched  the  human
resource development strategy for the Public Service  at  Ngqushwa,  in  the
Eastern Cape. The purpose of this strategy  is  to  ensure  that  education,
training and development in the Public Service happen in a  coherent  manner
through better co-ordination and alignment. I would like  to  say  that,  in
this regard, we reflected on training targets last year through  the  Public
Service Sector Education and Training Authority, PSETA.

I would like to say to the labour leaders and the rest of us  in  Government
that we need to push harder and push PSETA harder  to  ensure  that  we  not
only meet those training targets  but  go  beyond  them.  It  is  absolutely
fundamental for us to take forward the development that is required  in  the
Public Service and to effect the restructuring required.

The  SA  Management  Development  Institute,  once  again,  built   on   its
performance that I reported upon from this podium last year. By the  end  of
the  financial  year,  2001-02,  they  had  trained  12-250  Public  Service
employees. This comes to a  total  of  62  837  person  training  days.  The
Presidential  Strategic  Leadership  Development   Programme   remains   the
flagship of Samdi.  Currently,  41  modules  are  booked  and  presented  to
various national and  provincial  departments  each  and  every  month.  The
anticipated  key  programmes  linked  to  competency  profiles  will  become
compulsory for all senior managers in the Public Service.  In  this  regard,
the SA Police Service, which is represented here  this  afternoon  as  well,
has taken the lead in making the PSLDP mandatory at director and  assistant-
commissioner levels. We must applaud them for that. [Applause.]

Samdi has also entered into a strategic partnership with the Police  Service
that will entail the training of  700  managers  and  an  additional  4  000
middle managers under the umbrella of the Presidential Strategic  Leadership
Development Programme; the training of 180 trainers who will be  responsible
for the new recruits into the WSAPS; and the development of a  course  which
deals with violence against women and children. This course was launched  on
13 May this year. I do want  to  assure  the  hon  members  that  an  impact
assessment study of the most important programmes has been commissioned  and
the preliminary report is available. I can speak to that in closing.

Regarding good labour practices and improving the conditions of  service,  I
would like to pause here and relate an incident that happened on Monday  the
20th when I addressed a meeting in Kimberley. I asked  the  public  servants
in the hall: What would you like me to talk about? A Mr  Isaacs,  who  is  a
public servant, replied.

Hy het gesê dat hulle salarisverhogings wil hê. Sou ek  Donderdag  oor  iets
wou praat, moet dit wees oor salarisverhogings. My antwoord aan hom was  dat
hy vandag na my moet luister.

Ek sal kom by die punt wat mnr Isaacs gemaak het, maar ek wil  eerstens  sê:
As die grootste  werkgewer  in  die  land  kan  ek  met  trots  sê  dat  die
Staatsdiens 'n leier is. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[He said that they wanted salary increases. Should I  want  to  speak  about
anything on Thursday, it should be about salary increases. My answer to  him
was that he should listen to me today.

I shall get to the point that Mr Isaacs made, but firstly  I  wish  to  say:
Being the biggest employer in the  country,  I  can  proudly  say  that  the
Public Service is a leader.]

It is a leader in terms of  the  application  of  best  practice  in  labour
relations. We ensure that we adhere to the  country's  labour  laws  at  all
times, and I would argue that sometimes we even exceed the  requirements.  I
am sure that my colleagues and partners who are seated on the  far  left  in
the public gallery will agree  with  me  regarding  that.  In  order  to  be
competitive, as an employer, we continually have to ensure that  we  improve
the conditions of service of public servants.  Last  year,  we  restructured
the salary structure of the senior management cadre, that is  levels  13  to
16. This  year,  we  will  proceed  with  looking  at  how  to  improve  the
structuring of remuneration for salary levels 11 and 12.  We  are  currently
negotiating with Public Service labour unions on  the  new  pay  progression
system. We believe that we will resolve that around the end of the month.

The Department of Public Service and Administration also completed a  report
that will reflect on the comparison between conditions  of  service  in  the
Public  Service  and  those  in  the  local  government   sphere.   We   are
particularly  going  to  address  the  issues  around  mobility  across  the
different spheres of Government. In addition to these initiatives,  we  have
task teams working on the possible selection and  accreditation  of  medical
aid and administrators for Public Service  employees.  A  management  policy
and procedure  on  incapacity  leave  and  ill-health  retirement  has  been
developed and, in this regard, consultations with labour are  proceeding.  A
tender for the appointment of a health risk manager for the  Public  Service
will be issued soon.

I  have  previously  raised  two  pertinent  issues,  namely  the  need  for
administrative capacity to handle corruption  and  the  challenge  to  civil
society to analyse causes and effects of corruption. As Government,  we  did
not leave these challenges to others, we responded ourselves.  I  can  state
without reservation that we have made successful  and  substantial  progress
to fulfil the spirit and letter of the Government's programme  in  order  to
ensure clean administration and a good governance  dispensation  across  all
spheres of South African society.

Our first success was to create  the  national  anticorruption  forum  as  a
formal mechanism to bring the public, business  and  civil  society  sectors
together to fight corruption in all aspects of  our  society.  Secondly,  we
have embarked upon the implementation  of  a  comprehensive  integrated  and
coherent Public Service anticorruption strategy  which  is  co-ordinated  by
the Department of Public  Service  and  Administration.  The  current  Bill,
which is before the  justice  committee,  deals  with  the  whole  issue  of
corruption and is precisely based on this strategy.

Thanks  to  the  Public  Service  Commission,  an  audit  of  the   national
anticorruption agencies was completed in  August  last  year.  This  greatly
contributed  to  the  development  of  the  Public  Service   anticorruption
strategy.

So what can we look forward to this year? In addition to  the  aims  that  I
have just mentioned, a dedicated  effort  is  being  made  to  increase  our
institutional capacity on the systems and skills level.

Over the next few months, the following will be done: Firstly,  the  release
of the findings of  the  first  ever  comprehensive  corruption  assessment;
secondly, the audit of departmental  anticorruption  capabilities;  thirdly,
the training of at least 100 investigators and prosecutors in  the  area  of
corruption supported by a very practical and  detailed  handbook  for  these
corruption busters; and, fourthly, the integration of  ethical  training  in
all of Samdi's courses and the roll-out of training for  presiding  officers
in disciplinary cases. [Applause.]

It is within the context of modernising  Government  focused  on  addressing
basic needs and functioning as a  global  player  that  we  established  the
Centre for Public Service Innovation in September 2001. I believe  that  the
chairperson,  Gugu  Hlatshwayo,  is  somewhere  in  this  august   Assembly,
probably up in the gallery.  This  particular  initiative  aims  to  provide
support to the ongoing challenge of  improving  ways  in  which  the  public
receives   services   within   the   broader   context   of    socioeconomic
sustainability.  It  anticipates  doing  this  by  demonstrating   practice,
facilitating partnerships,  rewarding  initiatives  and  sharing  knowledge.
Under the guidance of an able  board  and  with  the  commitment  and  added
energy and dedication of a small  staff,  the  centre  focused,  during  its
first nine months of existence, on  developing  an  effective  institutional
base and establishing  the  necessary  network  of  partnerships  that  will
enable it to perform successfully.

The establishment of a learning organisation is not  a  once-off  event.  It
requires many initiatives and interventions that in  their  totality  result
in  the  creation  of  an  organisational  culture  that  is  conducive   to
reflecting on past performance and  drawing  lessons  to  ensure  continuous
improvement. As Ndebele wisdom tells us, ``A good loinskin is  sewn  in  the
general company''. In other words, knowledge is gained by learning from  the
experience of others. It is through this that we can say that we  have  made
progress over the past year with the  evaluation  of  heads  of  department;
conducting our first senior management service  conference;  publishing  the
first two editions of the Service Delivery Review, which  hon  members  will
find in front of the Old Assembly and which is a learning  journal  for  the
Public Service; and strengthening  and  multiplying  the  learning  networks
that are functioning across the Public Service. We are also  going  to  look
at reviewing of our legislative framework,  and  we  will  reflect  on  that
within the coming months.

Through our international involvement, we have, in addition to our  daunting
tasks domestically, assumed an increasingly active and responsible  role  in
public service transformation in the SADC  region,  in  Africa  through  our
commitment to Nepad, and in the world at large through  our  involvement  in
some of the public management think tanks in  the  United  Nations  and  the
Commonwealth and in other international initiatives. Through  the  political
leadership from Cabinet and the work  of  the  governance  cluster,  we  are
supporting the Nepad secretariat in the areas of  governance  and  capacity-
building.

We are putting the evidence before the House and  clearly  showing  that  we
know which levers to pull to achieve the necessary  success.  The  first  of
these is clearly to identify the cause for which  we  are  working.  Old  as
well as new public servants must share our vision  with  us.  They  must  be
inspired by the idea of serving all the people  with  equal  enthusiasm  and
dedication. We must ensure that the ethical basis  from  which  we  work  is
beyond reproach. We must ensure that we stay current. We  must  ensure  that
our employees, who are the most valuable resources in  the  Public  Service,
are developed on a continual basis and are treated in an  exemplary  way  so
that the Public Service is able to attract and retain  the  best  that  this
country has to offer. Finally, we also need to ensure that  we  continue  to
innovate and learn.

At this point, I  would  like  to  make  an  announcement  relating  to  the
conditions of service and the restructuring of the Public Service.

So, mnr Isaac Elliot, hier kom dit nou.  [So,  Mr  Isaac  Elliott,  here  it
comes now.]

I would like to take this opportunity to mention that the Public Service Co-
ordinating Bargaining Council, the PSCBC,  concluded  a  landmark  multiterm
agreement on salaries and conditions of service for  the  period  2002-2004.
Government is committed to the letter and spirit of this agreement and  will
accordingly ensure that  it  is  not  only  a  subject  for  praise  but  is
implemented throughout the Public Service. As  the  Government  we  recommit
ourselves to this agreement whilst at the same time recognising  the  global
and local economic developments that have resulted in  inflationary  figures
that exceed the thresholds that we earmarked in the agreement.

The April figures released by Statistics South  Africa  stand  at  8,8%.  We
could not and did not foresee these developments as a result of a number  of
factors including the depreciation of the currency during the  last  quarter
of 2001 and the first quarter of this year and the  rise  in  the  price  of
fuel. But, notwithstanding these developments, we do  want  to  ensure  that
these do not impact negatively on public servants.

Following a discussion that I had with labour leaders this morning, I  would
like to announce that the salary adjustment for 2002-03 will  be  linked  to
CPIX  -  to  inflation  calculated  year-on-year.  This   will   take   into
consideration the pay progression payment. This adjustment, as  I  said,  is
in line, in principle, with the understanding reached this morning and  will
be finalised in the PSCBC.

I will return to this House to present the final agreement,  but  it  is  in
line with inflation. Those people and all Public Service employees who  know
what the agreement is expected an increase that would be 7,5%  plus  a  half
percent, which would be 8%. We appeal to  them  to  look  at  the  inflation
figures as we will ensure that we meet them and look at pay progression.

Since October 2001 and early March of this year, the employer  and  employee
parties were engaged in  protracted  negotiations  in  the  chamber  on  the
transformation and restructuring of the  Public  Service.  On  6  March,  we
signed the framework agreement, which enjoys the support of over 40% of  the
employee  parties  in  the  chamber.  Much   effort   and   commitment   was
demonstrated by Government as the employer and the Public Service unions  to
find a way to give effect to commitments that were made  during  the  Public
Service  jobs  summit  at  the  start  of  2001  regarding  Public   Service
transformation and restructuring.

However, in view of this deadlock in negotiations with the majority  of  the
employee parties, the terms of the agreement signed by  the  employer  on  6
March, being the last offer we made, will now be  implemented  in  terms  of
the Public Service Act and other relevant laws.

I now want to go on to the Sita board. One of the challenges  that  we  face
in keeping our organisations modern is to  ensure  that  the  organisational
structure and governance arrangements for our  public  sector  organisations
continue to meet the demands of the time and context.

Sita has gone through extensive restructuring during the past  year,  and  I
would  want  to   thank   the   nonexecutive   board   members   under   the
chairpersonship of Sello Rasethaba for the  work  they  have  done  in  this
regard. We are at this particular point in time  ready  to  ensure  that  we
hand the baton over. In this regard Cabinet has decided  to  appoint  a  new
board to coincide with the end  of  term  of  the  current  board,  and  the
challenges of a restructured Sita to ensure  that  it  meets  its  high-tech
demands and challenges. The new chairperson of the Sita  board  to  whom  we
entrust the restructured Sita is Miss Zodwa Manase,  who  is  seated  on  my
left. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: She is on the Minister's right.

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, she is a capable person that  brings  with  her
strong corporate finance and oversight abilities. She will  be  assisted  by
the following nonexecutive directors, some of whom are in  the  gallery:  Ms
Lucienne Abrahams, Adv Leah  Gcabashe,  Mr  Mike  Roussos  and  Dr  Sibusiso
Sibisi. I would like to welcome these new members to  our  family  and  look
forward to the benefit of their experience and expertise. [Applause.]
Finally, in closing, I would like to take this opportunity to  publicly  and
formally express my appreciation to a range of  people,  both  those  within
the public administration family and those who have  the  interests  of  the
Public Service at heart, for their support and  their  dedication.  I  would
like to start with Prof Stan Sangweni and his Public Service  commissioners,
they have a very special status in the Public Service  family  and  I  would
like to thank them for playing their role with the necessary  integrity  and
independence. [Applause.]

The leaders of the various units  that  relate  to  me  are  the  directors-
general Job Mokgoro, who is unable to be with us today  and  is  represented
through the acting director-general from Samdi,  Muthanyi  Robinson  Ramaite
from  DPSA,  Mpumi  Sikhosana  from  the  office  of  the   Public   Service
Commission, the CEO Colin van Schalkwyk from Sita  and  a  new  team  member
who, in a very  short  space  of  time,  has  already  made  her  mark,  the
executive director for the Centre  for  Public  Service  Innovation,  Glenda
White. Without them and their respective teams, we would have not been  able
to stand here today and report on progress to members.
I would like  to  thank  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Public  Service  and
Administration, initially under the leadership of  the  present  Chief  Whip
and now under the member of Parliament John Gomomo, the former president  of
Cosatu,  who  comes  in  as  we  deal  with  the  issues  of  inflation  and
restructuring and  all  that,  for  having  assisted  greatly  in  asserting
effective  political  oversight  of  the  Public  Service   reform   agenda.
[Applause.]

As I say thank you to the team, I have not  mentioned  many.  I  would  also
like to say thank you to those who are leaving the Public Service  to  other
jobs, having served their time. I would  like  to  single  out  the  longest
serving of these, Miss Cindy August. She is with the Ministry  and  she  has
been in DPSA for eight years. She is now being  stolen  by  the  SA  Revenue
Service, to open their parliamentary office. [Applause.] I thank  Cindy  for
her activist work within the Ministry. She kept our feet on the ground.  She
will get Sars's feet on the ground  as  well,  the  taxman  must  understand
that. There are others, and one other person whom I would like  to  isolate,
Colleen, who is running away to  Salga.  This  is  not  going  to  make  our
initiatives with local government any simpler. We will fight them  hard  and
work as well with them, whether she is there or not. [Applause.]

I would like to say to the others who are moving on that I  wish  them  well
wherever they are going. They will serve us from wherever they are.  But  we
grow from strength to strength. The  Public  Service  is  changing  for  the
better and we hope this Budget Vote makes Tata Sisulu proud. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, I know your home is  in  the  left,
but to point to the right and call it the left is taking it to  a  different
level. [Laughter.]

Mr P J GOMOMO: Madam Speaker,  hon  Minister  for  the  Public  Service  and
Administration, hon members of Parliament, chairperson and  members  of  the
Public Service Commission, directors-general  and  deputy  directors-general
and also the senior management  present  here  today,  leadership  of  trade
union organisations present here in the gallery today ...

... ngephakama amaqabane ukuze abonwe. [The  comrades  should  stand  up  so
that they could be seen.

Since the presentation of the 2002-03 Budget by  the  Minister  of  Finance,
Minister Trevor Manuel, various committees  had  a  series  of  interactions
within Parliament and with various departments in order to change the  lives
of the people of South Africa.

Today's Budget Vote is not a different activity, but a continuation  of  our
national political agenda to transform and accelerate service  delivery  for
a better life for all. Once again today's event is not a platform to  simply
raise problems about the Public Service, but a platform that we  should  use
to instil a culture of good governance in our country. However, it  is  also
paramount to raise concerns in a responsible manner for the benefit  of  the
nation and propose strategies for improving the lives of South Africans.

The success of the state depends on the efficient performance of its  Public
Service. In the case of these institutions, the Budget Vote we are  debating
now is central and critical. We want to make sure that we move away  from  a
control-oriented Public Service or a role-bound  one  to  a  people-centred,
delivery-oriented Public Service which is an instrument of development.

It  is  imperative  to  note  this.  [Interjections.]  Ndiyaxolisa   kumfana
wasemaXesibeni. [I would like to tender my apologies to the young  man  from
the Xesibe clan.]

It is imperative to note that good work has been done  in  terms  of  policy
formulation in the  Public  Service,  but  more  important  is  the  correct
implementation of our policies. Recently the Portfolio Committee  on  Public
Service and Administration visited the SA Management Development  Institute,
the Department of Public Service and Administration, the  State  Information
Technology Agency and  the  office  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  in
Pretoria.

Without any doubt, from the interaction with the  above-mentioned  agencies,
it is indeed clear that the South  African  Public  Service  is  taking  its
rightful position. However, I sincerely  appeal  to  the  Minister  for  the
Public Service and Administration  to  ensure  that  what  is  discussed  in
boardrooms or in offices impacts more  on  citizens  of  our  country,  both
rural and urban.

I also want to salute the  men  and  women  in  the  administrative  arm  of
Government for the job that I have observed  during  these  visits.  I  just
want to say to them: Keep up with the good work. Those public  servants  who
keep on neglecting our people and who are lazy to do their job must make  up
their minds now, because the ANC-led Government will not allow that type  of
a behaviour to continue at all. [Applause.] Those who are charged  with  the
responsibility to manage must do so with a focused mind, so that  this  type
of behaviour does not continue. We  are  not  running  a  spaza  shop  here,
siphethe umcimbi wabantu [we are dealing  with  matters  affecting  people].
The political heads and senior management must closely monitor and  evaluate
administrative systems in  order  to  identify  any  gaps  related  to  poor
performance.

There is no need to hear that a child died in hospital, a woman  gave  birth
in a car here in the Western Cape or a TB hospital is to be  closed  in  the
Eastern Cape due to negligence or poor performance. We took power  in  order
to bring about a correct political order.  Let  us  display  that  order  in
every respect.

It is critical that each public servant is faithful to the country  and  its
people and abides by the Constitution in  the  performance  of  their  daily
duties. I want to make it very clear to all departments, both  national  and
provincial,  that  it  is  not  acceptable  to  neglect  the  constitutional
principles entrenched in our Constitution when performing daily  tasks.  The
slogan ``People First'' is well  captured  in  ``Batho  Pele''  or  ``Abantu
Kuqala''. Therefore  I  request  all  departments  to  institutionalise  the
principle outlined in that document. It is not just a document, but  also  a
programme of this Government.

In dealing these matters, let us not forget that the public can also  advise
us, as Government, on how to address these  problems  because  they  do  not
happen somewhere else,  they  happen  in  our  communities.  Therefore,  the
imbizo, an initiative of the President, allows the people  of  South  Africa
to speak and tell our Government about who it is that  is  blocking  service
delivery, what the corrupt practices are  in  their  communities,  what  the
administrative problems are that block the  issuing  of  licences,  identity
documents, birth certificates and so forth.

The Public Service Commission has also developed a project to encourage  the
public to engage with the Government through the citizens'  forums.  I  urge
political heads of both national and provincial departments to  support  the
citizens' forums  in  order  to  allow  the  public  to  interact  with  the
government of their own choice, in their own  languages  and  in  their  own
fashion. When we said ``the people shall govern'' it  was  not  a  political
slogan, but a politically visionary agenda.

Through these  forums,  South  Africans  have  to  share  information  about
matters that relate to service delivery for  the  benefit  of  our  country.
Once more, I appeal for co-operation in every corner of our  country.  I  am
pleased  with  the  manner  that  the  Department  of  Public  Service   and
Administration, the Public  Service  Commission,  other  agencies  and  some
departments are handling corruption in the  Public  Service.  I  trust  that
they will be able to steer their strategies in a co-ordinated fashion.

The Department of Public Service and Administration,  DPSA,  has  shown  its
tremendous impact in the Public Service through its policies.  However,  the
DPSA, as a policy formulation department, has  performed  very  much  within
expectations. I urge departments,  in  respect  of  both  the  national  and
provincial, to ensure that they comply with  any  policies  that  have  been
formulated  to  improve  the  lives  of  people.  Noncompliance  cannot   be
tolerated at all because it affects ordinary people.

The State Information Technology Agency, Sita, has  made  a  change  in  the
Public Service, especially when Government policy has  been  formulated.  It
enables the  Government  to  manage  Government  information  of  the  South
African population  well.  What  is  vital  is  how  we  use  technology  to
facilitate service delivery. The SA Management  Development  Institute  must
continue building the  capacity  of  the  public  servants.  Retraining  and
refresher courses are  critical  in  the  Public  Service,  particularly  at
management level, both in national and provincial departments.

With regard to labour relations, I want to appeal to  the  two  parties,  ie
the  Government  and  the  unions,  to  resolve  their  differences  in  the
bargaining chamber in order to have a restructured  and  transformed  Public
Service.

In conclusion, I want to acknowledge the initiatives that  have  been  shown
by Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in  Gauteng  province  with  the  aim  of
turning around the institution, and the  spirit  of  voluntarism  which  has
also been shown by its  local  people.  It  is  true  that  the  Vukuzenzele
project is alive.

When our President was addressing the  nation  in  February  this  year,  he
said:


  Of decisive importance to the millions of our people and  the  future  of
  our country, as we meet here today, the central question we will have  to
  answer at the end of the  day  is  whether  what  we  are  doing  as  the
  legislature, the executive, the judiciary, the fourth  estate  and  civil
  society, is helping  to  lift  from  the  shoulders  of  our  people  the
  intolerable burden of poverty and underdevelopment.

Abantu abangafuniyo ukusebenza  mabaxwaye  iibhatyi  zabo  bahambe.  Asiyiyo
indawo yokudlala le siphethe ilizwe. [People who do not want to work  should
take their jackets and go. This is not a playground. We  have  to  rule  the
country.]

However, the problems in the Eastern Cape's health system,  with  regard  to
TB hospitals, have to be addressed in order to improve  health  services  in
the region. I trust that the DPSA and the  Public  Service  Commission  will
deal with this matter with immediate effect.

My colleagues will provide a detailed policy framework on this  Budget  Vote
soon.

KwaNtu  kuthiwa:  Amaqobokazana  angalal'emzini  sukuba  elahlekile,  sukuba
kunyembelekile kuloo mzi. Umntu akabethwa ngomnqayi  kuba  umnqayi  yintonga
esulungekileyo yokuhambela imicimbi yomzi. Ungabetha umntu ngomnqayi  sukuba
umshwabulela.  I-ANC  iyaluxhasa  olu  hlahlo  lwabiwo-mali.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[There is a saying among the Bantu communities that goes: The  young  women!
Forward with the women's good efforts! There is  a  stick  (from  a  certain
species of a forest tree) with which a person cannot be  beaten  because  it
is considered  valuable  and  is  only  carried  on  certain  occasions  and
official business. It is believed that if a  person  could  be  beaten  with
such a stick, that person would be cursed.  The  ANC  supports  this  Budget
Vote. [Applause.]]

Mr B G BELL: Mr Chairperson, Ministers and  fellow  members  of  Parliament,
senior public servants and members of the public,  it  is  my  privilege  to
speak, on behalf of the DP, in this budget debate. [Interjections.]

Mr D V BLOEM: You must apply for amnesty for Tony Leon. [Interjections.]

Mr B G BELL: I would like to pay tribute to  all  the  public  servants  who
have chosen to serve society although they  are  not  always  receiving  the
compensation that they deserve and possibly less than they could receive  in
the private sector.

I would like to talk about Samdi. The aim of Samdi is to  provide  practical
and customer-driven training that  can  lead  to  improved  performance  and
service delivery in the public sector. This  aim  is  very  commendable  and
should be encouraged by all. It is heartening that  Samdi  is  fully  booked
and has a waiting list for certain of their programmes.

I would like to repeat my warning that unless senior  management  is  behind
any  course  that  is  being  presented,  no  positive  results  will  flow.
Therefore it is essential that senior management has a major  say  in  which
of their staff attend courses and on course  content,  and  when  the  newly
trained public servant returns that he is allowed  to  implement  what  they
have been taught. There  is  no  certainty  that  EU  donor  funds  will  be
available beyond the third quarter  of  this  year.  This  problem  must  be
addressed soon.

Financial management and project management training is  receiving  priority
by  Samdi.  This  is  very  encouraging  and  should  be  supported  by  all
departments in view of the Public Finance Management Act,  which  calls  for
vastly improved control over finance and project management  in  the  Public
Service.

Samdi should be supported by all departments and provinces.  This  does  not
seem to be the case as only 52% of  national  departments  are  using  their
services at present. Samdi is a management tool and, if used  by  all,  will
improve the efficiency of the Public  Service  and  delivery  to  all  South
Africans.

It is now required that all departmental training undertaken by  Samdi  must
be  paid  for  by  the  department  concerned.  It  would  seem  that   some
departments are not keen on complying with the new  rules,  and  this  could
cause a serious cash flow problem.

With regard to the Public Service commission, I do not want to harp on  that
subject,  but  our  Public  Service  Commission  still  talks  of   African,
coloured, indian and white in reporting, despite the debate on  the  subject
of Africanism and the statement made by our President that he  considers  us
all Africans.

The pattern of spending within the Public Service  commission  has  improved
considerably over the past few years and they are to be commended for that.

The anticorruption campaign that was launched with great  fanfare  does  not
seem to have got  off  the  ground,  due  to  extremely  difficult  logistic
problems. We have been told that a  new  initiative  and  a  more  realistic
operation will be put together. Hopefully this will work.

The commission is now advocating that the  companies  and  individuals  who,
through their actions, are found to  have  acted  in  a  corrupt  manner  be
blacklisted. This is an excellent idea, but will only  work  if  all  of  us
have the same commitment to oppose corruption and comply with the  rules  as
set out by this system.

The suggestion that a single hotline be set up  for  all  corruption  to  be
reported to,  properly  financed  and  well  publicised,  promises  a  great
improvement on the current arrangement. It is essential  that  the  whistle-
blower always be protected.

The lack of funds spent to fight the HIV/Aids pandemic is chronic.  We  have
been informed that a policy on HIV/Aids has been drawn up,  but  so  far  we
have not seen it. It  is  obvious  that  unless  we  put  some  effort  into
fighting this pandemic our country's economy will  be  a  complete  disaster
and the South African nation will be decimated. The latest report  from  the
WHO quotes a disaster looming in  our  Department  of  Education  and  this,
obviously, will extend to all other departments.

In reporting on their activities on  the  current  position  the  department
only reports on numbers by race, but never by qualifications of  incumbents.
The verification of qualifications of all senior staff has  been  published.
The results are very encouraging and appear  to  give  our  public  services
some basis on which to build for the future.

The citizens' forum concept is excellent and should be  pursued.  The  Batho
Pele programme has lost its momentum and any effort to revive it  will  more
than likely cost a great deal of money and still finish in  failure.  I  did
suggest a change of name, which, in my days in industry, was the  ploy  that
we used to introduce a new management system. This may help, but  we  cannot
put too much confidence in this trick. The citizens' forum is a new  concept
for us and, I believe, will be a successful innovation.

Talking of the DPSA, at a recent briefing of  the  portfolio  committee,  we
were told of the SMS annual appraisal system that was  being  introduced  as
from April this year. As all SMSs have been required to sign  a  performance
contract with the departments, there are criteria which are  laid  down  and
are expected to  be  met  by  these  highly  paid  and,  presumably,  highly
qualified officials.

A performance appraisal has to be conducted on all these officials  annually
if they expect to be considered for bonuses  as  laid  down  by  the  Public
Service agreements.  These  appraisals  call  for  points  to  be  allocated
according to a formula, and, should an incumbent not receive more  than  50%
of the points, his services will be terminated. But if he is  on  probation,
his probation period may be extended.

This  policy  is  highly  recommended  on  condition  that  the  system   is
objectively carried out and the official had some say in the  criteria  used
to judge him. My fear in applying this operation is that treatment  will  be
similar to that of  senior  ANC  politicians  who  have  been  found  to  be
incompetent. This, invariably, has led to  redeployment  to  a  more  senior
level. [Interjections.] One example is a Gauteng mayor who was found  to  be
totally incompetent as  a  mayor,  but  was  acceptable  as  an  ambassador.
[Interjections.]

Concerning the Public Service delivery, during  the  committee  period,  the
portfolio committee visited a  number  of  provinces  and  some  interesting
projects.

On a visit to Chris Hani Baragwanath  Hospital,  it  was  obvious  that  the
training of nurses was being neglected. In answer to questions  put  to  the
relevant Minister, we were told that in August 2001 there was a shortage  of
21% nurses and 20% doctors in the country's Department of Health.

These  statistics  are  very  disturbing  and,  as  the  Public  Service  is
responsible for manning, we need to look into this problem. We  visited  the
Alexandra Renewal Project. This  project  is  progressing  well,  but  there
appear to be some problems between the project organisers  and  the  ANC  in
the area, who disagree with the project organisers'  general  philosophy  of
the project. We trust that sanity will  prevail  and  the  experts  will  be
allowed to drive the project to the end.

A small contingent of the  committee  visited  the  Western  Cape  and  were
impressed with what was in place. It was obvious that whatever  we  saw  was
well established and I trust  that  no  major  changes  will  be  instituted
because of the change to the ANC and the New NP coalition  that  is  now  in
place. The agreement on restructuring of the Public Service  signed  by  40%
of the unions will be a  major  step  forward  if  the  differences  can  be
resolved.

With regard to Sita, from reports it appears to be gaining ground and  I  am
sure that in time it will be a major asset to the operations of  our  Public
Service and consequently the economy in general.

Finally, the three-year wage agreement with the the trade unions  will  give
the Public Service  the  breathing  space  to  put  in  place  a  number  of
outstanding issues that, if solved now, could augur well for the  future.  I
thank the House for listening to me. [Applause.]

Mr L J MODISENYANE:  Chairperson,  the  Department  of  Public  Service  and
Administration is beginning to give effect  to  the  implementation  of  the
policies it has developed so far. On assessment these policies are  relevant
in that they are addressing the problems experienced by our  communities  on
service delivery.

Hon members will  surely  agree  that  the  labour  framework  agreement  is
beginning to bear fruit on the relationship between  the  Government  as  an
employer on the one hand and the unions and associations on the other  hand.
I therefore commend the department on its good  attempts  at  bettering  the
lives of our people.

We are aware that programmes have been put in place. The need  is  to  speed
them up, especially affirmative action and skills development,  because  the
two go hand in hand. It is important that the  Public  Service  reflect  the
demographics of the country.

My appeal is  that  affirmative  action  be  understood  as  correcting  the
imbalances of the past and not reverse discrimination as some  members  want
to believe. The implementation of affirmative action goes along with  skills
development so that it does not become mere tokenism to  see  a  black  face
replacing a white face.

What is needed is efficiency and effectiveness in service  delivery  in  the
spirit of Batho Pele. Performance agreement  contracts  came  at  the  right
time, because they give management an opportunity for self-evaluation.  They
work according to plans they agreed to themselves.

In die ou bedeling was  daar  'n  paar  struikelblokke  met  betrekking  tot
evaluering. Daar was party mense wat ``op 'n persoonlike  basis''  beter  as
hulle kollegas besoldig is hoewel hulle oor laer kwalifikasies  beskik  het.
As hulle kollegas meer daarvan wou weet, was  dit  raadsaam  om  liewers  te
bedank, want die rede vir die hoër besoldiging was  alleen  daar  bo  iewers
bekend. [In the previous dispensation there were a  few  obstacles  relating
to evaluation. There were some  people  who  were  remunerated  better  than
their  colleagues  ``on  a  personal  basis''  although   they   had   lower
qualifications. If their colleagues wanted to know more about  that  it  was
advisable rather to resign, because the reason for the greater  remuneration
was only known somewhere up there.]

It is also important to note the seriousness that the department  is  giving
to HIV/Aids. I do not see it as my colleague, Mr Bell, has just said. I  see
it as progress because there is a programme  in  partnership  with  relevant
departments at the moment. In the long run, success will be achieved.

We must realise that before the State Information Technology Agency was  put
in place, information management  was  almost  nonexistent  or  ineffective,
especially in the former homelands. South Africa is  now  one  country.  The
fragmented procurement system which was in place has been totally  reversed.
Those  providers  who  milked  the  Government  have  been  eliminated.  The
Government is now able to negotiate good deals for  itself.  Challenges  are
still there because sometimes departments do not pay bills in time. This  is
going  to  be  addressed  through  reforms.  When  systems  are  in   place,
performance levels will be advanced.

The department is moving towards implementing  e-government.  We  know  that
rural  areas  will  not  benefit  immediately  because  the  electrification
process is still continuing and will ultimately reach the remaining places.

[What I've realised is that there are people who are in a tremendous  hurry.
Those impatient people are usually those who stood at the  back  and  hidden
away when guns were rattling during the times of struggle. The hon  Mr  T  K
Mopeli once spoke on the Makumane a Mona le Mane  programme  and  said  that
some people thought that when the ANC took over government, they would  just
say: ``Let there be houses'', and there would be houses, or ``Let  there  be
roads'', and there would be roads. The Government is taking everything  into
stride in the process  of  speedy  reconstruction  and  development  because
doing things slowly but surely is worthwhile, but  rushing  into  things  is
very dangerous.

I would like to conclude by saying  that  those  workers  who  are  slinking
around and playing truant will in the  near  future  be  told  to  fend  for
themselves. In saying that I, together with  the  chairperson,  the  hon  Mr
Gomomo, say to them: ``Get up! Go and fend for yourselves''. Africa, now  is
the time! You stood back for a long time while other countries  were  taking
the lead. Today, even we, the not so notorious, enjoy recognition''.]

I therefore support the Votes  of  the  Department  of  Public  Service  and
Administration and the SA Management Development Institute.

E re ke re ha di ba mohatla kgwiti. [Ditlatse.] [Thank you.] [Applause.]]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Chairperson, I would like to begin my speech by  expressing
my sincere appreciation to the chair of the portfolio committee, the hon  Mr
P J Gomomo, for always initiating lively debate and discussion. We  can  add
a heartfelt ``Hear, Hear!'' to him.

It was Sir Wilfred Grenfell who said the following:


  The service we render to others is really the rent we pay for our room on
  this earth. It is obvious that man  himself  is  a  traveller,  that  the
  purpose of this world is not to have and to hold, but to give and serve.

I think this is a rather appropriate assertion for this debate.

Prior to 1994 the Public  Service  was  bureaucratic  and  fragmented  along
racial and ethnic lines. Today the Public  Service  has  become  a  national
asset of this country. It  is  this  department  that  is  the  foundational
department of service delivery, which, in the final  analysis,  touches  the
life of every South African.

The DPSA derives much of its challenges from the Public  Finance  Management
Act. During the portfolio committee meetings  the  DPSA  reported  that  206
performance contracts were outstanding. Clearly,  this  is  not  acceptable.
The performance contract is a measure of  the  person's  self-worth  and  an
important motivator unlocking individual and human resource potential.

We know that globalisation and technology have enabled  a  different  world,
and we constantly run the risk of being outdated. So the Public  Service  is
exercised in  this  dynamic  and  complex  world.  This  places  substantial
pressure on Sita, which runs the risk of being antiquated and obsolete.

The DPSA needs to constantly and systematically  review  and  ask  pertinent
questions about service delivery: its effectiveness, its outcomes, how  they
are delivered and the cost thereof. So the Budget Vote we  debate  today  is
really about rands and cents. It is here  that  we  begin  to  realise  that
there is no time for flip-flops in Government. Managers  have  to  be  sound
managers of public finance so that they can  be  able  to  scan  and  detect
malpractices and corruption.

We appreciate the gender profile of the department. Constantly we are  given
breakdowns of senior management in terms of race and  gender.  But  we  also
hope that this is not merely gender profiling or window  dressing.  We  feel
that we need to go beyond this. We need gender affirmation and  we  need  to
be developed mentally, thus creating a corporate culture. I can see the  hon
Minister is smiling at me, and I know that this will really be done.

Service  delivery  is  becoming  an  information   and   knowledge-intensive
process. Thus we need effective mechanisms to  turn  the  state  towards  e-
government, and the previous speaker spoke  about  this.  We  need  to  tell
people what we are doing. We need to report on progress.  We  need  to  know
what they are thinking. We need to listen. In the end,  they  are  the  end-
users of service delivery, if service delivery reaches them.

This is where, I believe, the citizen's jury or the  citizen's  forum  comes
to life. The IFP would like to support  this  initiative  because  we  think
this is where we impact on the lives of people. We believe  that  Government
has a lot to work on. It is not about dogma, it is about  what  really  pays
and what really works.

We need to inculcate an ethics culture. Therefore there can be no  room  for
complacency in the DPSA. It is virtually axiomatic  that  people  prefer  to
work in an ethical organisation rather than  an  organisation  that  has  no
standards. We need to tell employees that there is no place  for  them  when
they are incompetent, callous and corrupt.

We also need to train our Public Service  personnel  in  skills  and  Public
Service needs.  We  need  a  workforce  adjustment  programme.  We  need  to
structure programmes intelligently enough so that we  begin  to  retain  key
people. Clearly, we need to address  Public  Service  renewal,  and  so  the
emphasis  of  the  Public  Service  should  be  on  retention  and  not   on
retrenchment.  A  culture  of  performance,   excellence,   creativity   and
innovation should permeate the DPSA.

We also need  change:  change  in  organisation,  in  policy  direction,  in
delivery models or change management. These changes affect  the  demand  for
services provided by the Public Service. And  the  Public  Service  has  the
opportunity to be a model employer and to meet the needs of  Government  and
Ministry, and  to  be  able  to  ensure  succession  planning,  costing  and
organisational development.

The IFP believes that policies have to be continually  reviewed,  developed,
enhanced and streamlined on  an  inventory  of  best  practices.  A  strong,
efficient and effective Public Service  is  a  foundation  upon  which  this
Government carries out its priorities and meets its objectives.

Organisational stability and organisational  change  are  constants  in  any
public service. Often we need to be able to  transform  the  Public  Service
into  a  business  entity  along  the  traditional  lines  of  impartiality,
honesty, accountability and professionalism.

In South Africa  research  on  public  sector  procurement  policy  is  very
limited. Consequently there is a dire need to  strengthen  policymaking  and
implementation of public sector procurement, as well as  the  accountability
of public functionaries.

The impact of HIV/Aids is increasingly  felt  on  South  African  personnel.
These are crucial challenges to the DPSA and public  servants.  Let  us  not
have any gigantic illusions about this. Samdi needs to have a definite  plan
for HIV/Aids training, both in Correctional Services  and  the  SAPS.  There
needs to be a certification process in place. This has not happened as yet.

The IFP is convinced that the need for service delivery institutions has  to
be strengthened, and here  we  need  the  anticorruption  strategies  to  be
strengthened and the blacklisting of companies.

We are also concerned that at times Samdi has become  very  donor-dependent.
We believe that they need to move towards being  a  self-sustaining  entity.
Also, Samdi and Sita have very weak cost-recovery strategies, and  the  time
for waiting for payment should be done away with. We should actually  summon
DGs of the defaulting departments. We need to remember that  no  matter  how
meticulous our plans, they will fail if we do not execute them.
On  numerous  occasions  we  have  questioned  the  department   about   the
development of an asset register. We need to obtain this,  and  it  has  not
happened as yet.

Apart from mentoring  programmes,  we  feel  there  need  to  be  monitoring
programmes. We need constant reviews and delicate assessment.

At this juncture I would like to  thank  officials  of  the  department  for
constantly coming prepared for  the  committee's  barrage  of  interrogative
questioning. We saw a massive improvement in internal reporting.

We would also like to thank all the  directors-general  and  officials.  The
Department of the Public Service and  Administration  also  has  to  wrestle
with restructuring, and this will affect the lives and  livelihoods  of  all
employees of the department. The IFP believes that  restructuring  needs  to
take place within the ambit of trying to  retain  all  workers.  Here  I  am
reminded of the words of James Baldwin, who wrote: ``Not everything that  is
faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.''

I cheated  at  the  beginning  of  this  speech  with  the  quotation  about
leadership. The full quote reads as follows:


  The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to
  say thank you. In between the leader is a servant.

That is, I think the definition of the kind of leadership required  for  the
Public Service of  tomorrow.  The  successes  belong  to  the  thousands  of
workers who implement management programmes and are our interface  with  the
public and the communities that we serve. The IFP supports  the  budget  and
thanks all the public servants who meticulously carry out this task for  us.
[Applause.]

Nkskz L MALONEY: Mhlalingaphambili, ukuba bendisentlanganisweni  ngendisithi
... [Chairperson, if I was at a meeting I would say ...] I  am  covered  ...
ndanelisekile. Kambe,, ndibhatalelwa ukumela  abantu  bethu,  ndibathethele.
Ngoko ke ndiya kwenza njalo,  Mhlalingaphambili.  Ngenxa  yokuba  sele  ethe
gqaba gqaba uMphathiswa ngeSamdi ... [... I am satisfied. But I am  paid  so
I  could  speak  for  the  people.  Therefore,  I  will  do   as   required,
Chairperson, because the hon Minister has briefly talked  about  Samdi  ...]
... which is the South African Management Development Institution.

The theme of this Budget Vote is accelerating service  delivery  to  provide
customer care, and the managing of  quality  service  to  our  people.  This
relates to the Government's reconstruction and development  programme  which
seeks to  mobilise  the  country's  people  and  resources,  and  the  final
eradication of apartheid  and  the  building  of  a  democratic,  nonracial,
nonsexist future. The people of this country are its  major  resource.  That
is why we need to nurture them with the dignity and respect they deserve.

Samdi has been  given  the  responsibility  of  making  sure  that  it  acts
urgently to bring appropriate skills and training  into  the  public  sector
and utilise information technology to advance the cause of our  people,  and
defeat poverty and diseases. By doing that, we will be making sure that  the
frontiers of poverty are pushed back. For this to happen, we need  a  public
service that creates a sense of community, that must  be  connected  by  the
reality of people working together as a nation for a better life.

It is in this context that Samdi's work has been made easy, proceeding  from
individual assessment needs, up to the department's objectives and mission.

Ngoko ke oothoba sikutyele abafuneki kubasebenzi. Kuya  kufuneka  abasebenzi
bathabathe  inkxaxheba  ekuphuculeni  ubomi  babo.  Kufuneka  baxele   ukuba
yintoni   na   ebahluphayo,   abaswela   yona,   ukuze   bafumane   uqeqesho
olulungelelaniswe nemeko yabo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[People who just do what  they  are  told  are  not  needed  among  workers.
Workers are going to have to participate in  developing  their  lives.  They
should say what is bothering them, what they need so  that  they  could  get
training  that  is  appropriate  and  suitable  for  their  conditions   and
situations.]

The  implementation  of  affirmative  action  policies  is  incorporated  in
managers' training programmes. As we all know,  in  the  year  2000  it  was
agreed  that  at  management  level,  50%  should  be  black.  Women  should
constitute 30% and the 20% should consist of people  with  disabilities.  As
we are all aware, this is part of the process of dealing with the legacy  of
the past. We  must  continue  to  make  sure  that  our  Public  Service  is
representative. This task will continue until the  Public  Service  reflects
the true picture of all the people of South Africa.

In one of the  briefings  by  the  Department  of  the  Public  Service  and
Administration, we were told that about  47%  of  the  money  allocated  for
training has not yet been used by  certain  departments.  This  raises  very
serious concerns. The Presidential Strategic Leadership Development  launch,
which was organised by Samdi,  was  intended  to  take  the  Public  Service
programmes forward. All the directors-general and senior  managers  attended
that function. The launch was specifically aimed at increasing  capacity  at
the higher levels of the Public Service leadership.

The PSLDP, as it is called in short,  stimulated  interest  both  nationally
and internationally, for example, in SADC countries. I know for a fact  that
the University of Pretoria was seen as the best institution for rolling  out
the Presidential  Strategic  Leadership  Development  Programme,  of  course
working together with Samdi. But my concern is whether Samdi has any  future
plan in taking  this  popular  programme  to  the  previously  disadvantaged
universities and technikons.

Of Samdi's budget for this financial year,  93%  has  been  spent,  which  I
think is good news. The EU funds that Samdi is getting are welcome,  but  it
should be alert and not end up getting instructions and terms  of  reference
that do not address the  department's  objectives.  The  funding  should  be
integrated  in  training  and  development  programmes  which   respond   to
Government priorities and impact on the performance of the Public Service.

In one of Samdi's reports, it told the portfolio  committee  that  they  had
taken over courses such as discipline and evaluation from the Department  of
Public Service and Administration, and provided training with  no  financial
assistance from the  department.  To  me,  that  was  daylight  robbery,  as
charity begins at home. The Department of Public Service and  Administration
must lead by example. They must know that there is  nothing  for  ``mahala''
[nothing]. The Big Brother style is not acceptable at all. In  future,  when
the department decides to transfer certain programmes, they must  know  that
that goes with responsibility.

In Samdi's report, tabled in the portfolio  committee,  they  also  reported
that some departments refused to pay and cancelled courses  already  booked.
This is not acceptable at all. Firstly, those  departments  must  know  that
they still owe Samdi a cancellation fee. Secondly,  those  departments  must
know that training of managers is not a choice, but to make  sure  that  the
Government strengthens our Batho Pele policy and  provides  quality  service
for all South African citizens to have a better life. Thirdly,  it  is  time
for them to take training seriously. It should be clear in their minds  that
Samdi is not a charity organisation, and there is no such thing  as  a  free
lunch.

I want to talk about  Nepad,  which  is  a  new  phenomenon  in  the  Public
Service, which will need new strategies to be formulated, so that they  will
be able to grab the opportunities of learning from  one  another  and  share
our different expertise as a continent.

A meeting that took place between  Samdi,  the  Gender  Commission  and  the
Office on the Status of Women is a good move, as a meeting  of  this  nature
will assist Samdi in its preparation for the training  programme  on  gender
issues, as women, and blacks in particular, were  previously  disadvantaged,
discriminated against, oppressed and marginalised.  Democracy  will  not  be
complete unless women are put in their rightful places. [Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, two weeks  ago  the  Minister  for  the
Public Service and Administration told the portfolio committee that she  was
looking forward to today's debate. She expressed her  wish  for  a  vigorous
exchange during the debate. Unfortunately, the hon Waters is not here  today
so there will not be any feeble remarks in the members' debate.

One can understand the Minister's wish. For any Minister  who  is  dedicated
to his or her task, the budget debate of the department is both the time  to
reflect on performance and the time to contemplate the future,  more  so  if
one's views and ideas are not stagnated by the past  but  rather  driven  by
the excitement and challenges of the future that lies ahead.

The past should be seen as the source of power that  will  drive  people  to
work together for a new  future  full  of  hope  and  understanding  of  the
challenges. The poet and writer Sipho Sepamla sees the past and  the  future
in a special way that should speak not only to all of us in this House,  but
to every public servant, old and new. He writes as follows, and I quote:


  I want to talk life
  and bury waste
  the life of the gathering race
  and not the hate of tribes
  I long for the lost past
  but I won't unearth that
  because there is a past
  I don't want to hustle
  there is instead
  a future I must embrace
  there is for you and me
  a place
  we can huddle together
  to make this fire burn
  evermore

I believe that it was with the same vision for a united South Africa with  a
transformed Public Service that would understand and meet the  challenge  to
improve the quality of life of the millions  of  disadvantaged  people  that
former President Mandela appointed the  Presidential  Review  Commission  on
the Reform and Transformation of the Public  Service  in  South  Africa.  On
producing its report, the Presidential Review Commission noted that,  and  I
quote:


  The magnitude of the task of reforming and developing the Public  Service
  is such that the way forward will require the most careful  consideration
  by the Government as well as a wide process of consultation.

In the last sentence of the report, the commission states:


  We are accordingly confident that the paths of reform we  have  indicated
  can and will be vigorously pursued in the years ahead.

Therefore it is  imperative  that  we,  as  political  role-players,  should
decide whether we want to be part of the process to build,  reshape,  adjust
and improve for better results, in the quest for good service and  effective
governance; or whether we want to be obstructive,  negative  and  suspicious
about every aspect of change.

Are we prepared to share in the clear and commonly accepted national  vision
or are we, at least, willing to enter into vigorous and positive debates  to
contribute to what should be our vision as a  nation?  Are  we  clearly  and
unequivocally committed to change that will make  provision  for  those  who
have been deprived for so many years and also take care of  those  who  need
to be protected against unfair practices, both  in  the  labour  and  social
spheres of society? Or  is  our  commitment  restricted  to  window-dressing
visits to townships and institutions for the sake of  propaganda  and  cheap
TV shots? [Interjections.]

As die skoen pas, trek hom aan. [If the shoe fits, wear it.]

We should ask ourselves:  How  much  are  we  buying  into  the  process  of
institutional re-engineering,  with  specific  emphasis  on  reconstruction,
nation-building and streamlining of bureaucratic  procedures,  in  order  to
make Government  departments  more  user-friendly?  Do  we  agree  with  the
improved system of human resource development in order to build  the  skills
and capacity that is required by the new Public Service?

We must support every effort towards effective forms  of  intersectoral  co-
ordination because that is essential for fostering  integration  in  policy-
making and the implementation of programmes  that  would  positively  affect
the day-to-day living of the people in this  country.  It  is  our  duty  to
ensure that the system of monitoring  and  evaluation,  which  will  produce
public servants who  are  efficient  and  effective  within  Government,  is
developed. If we expect our officials to maintain the  highest  standard  of
work ethics and productivity in order for Batho Pele  to  succeed,  we  must
provide them with the necessary skills and tools.
We should ask ourselves: What is the example that members of Parliament  are
setting in buying into the very processes and systems  that  we  create  for
this country? Are we showing respect for  rules  and  regulations  that  are
supposed to guide us in our conduct and commitment  to  duties?  Or  are  we
making a mockery of this institution that  is  supposed  to  provide  public
servants with policy and guidance?

How do we treat serious issues such  as  HIV/Aids  and  corruption?  Are  we
merely using those as a political football to score cheap political  points?
Or are we positively trying to contribute to deal with  the  development  of
risk management strategies for the Public Service such  as  a  comprehensive
HIV/Aids policy and the anticorruption strategies that the department  wants
to implement?

In our fight against corruption, we need to join forces  by  monitoring  the
activities of Government  departments  and  officials  who  operate  in  our
constituencies and  areas  of  responsibility.  We  need  to  ask  ourselves
whether we have taken up the full responsibility  of  ownership.  The  money
and assets of this state are our responsibility. We are  the  custodians  of
democracy. Are we good stewards, or are we willing to turn to  a  blind  eye
when it suits us? How do we follow up on known cases? Do we follow up or  do
we forget once those have lost their cheap propaganda value?

The New NP is mindful of the important role that the  Department  of  Public
Service and Administration should play in order  to  bring  the  effects  of
good governance to the people. The role that  the  DPSA  plays  in  the  co-
ordination  and  integration  of  policies   within   the   Government   and
administration cluster is emphasised by the fact that both the Minister  and
the director-general are the co-ordinators of the Ministers  and  directors-
general who fall within this cluster.

In order to grow and adjust, it is also essential that we look at the  needs
and areas of concern that have a negative impact on the quality of  life  of
so many people. I believe that the process of service delivery asked  of  us
to look closely at the interaction between Government  departments  such  as
Social Development and Home Affairs, Education and Social  Development,  and
Health and Social Development, to name but a few. I can provide  this  House
with numerous examples where the lack of commitment in one department had  a
disastrous effect on service delivery in the other.

Another area of concern is the inability or lack of capacity  by  Government
departments  to  spend  their  budgets.  This  also  applies  to  provincial
departments where services are deteriorating at an alarming speed, with  the
usual excuse of shortage of funds, only to  find  out  at  the  end  of  the
financial year that a department has underspent.  The  result  is  that  the
poor, the sick and the affected are worse off  than  ever  before.  This  is
simply not acceptable. I want to appeal to  the  Minister  today  to  please
exert pressure on those departments which are  committing  an  injustice  to
the people out there who are in need, but are deprived by underspending  due
to a lack of commitment from MECs and senior management.

Finally, in the words of Sepamla: Let  us  talk  life  -  the  life  of  the
gathering race. Let us all huddle together in an effort to  make  this  fire
burn for evermore. Let us take care and develop. Let us support and build.

We would like to express our thanks on  the  part  of  the  New  NP  to  the
chairperson, who has shown his capable  leadership  in  the  committee,  the
dedicated officials who have to  face  the  day-to-day  challenges  of  this
department and the Minister for the announcement, this afternoon,  that  the
Government is willing to look after its public servants in the way that  she
announced here. The New NP supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr M R BALOYI: Chairperson and honourable House, as I  participate  in  this
debate my focus will be on the  impact  of  the  activities  of  the  Public
Service Commission on the drive for a  Public  Service  geared  towards  the
distribution of services to enhance the quality of life of our people.

The  Public  Service  Commission   was   established   as   an   independent
organisation to monitor and evaluate the activities of  the  Public  Service
organs and to report to Parliament for action. My experience  of  the  style
of work of the Public Service Commission is that they  are  a  true  partner
for service delivery. Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  Public  Service
Commission's formal inception came  about  in  mid-1999,  we  are  proud  to
acknowledge that by the end of 2001 they had investigated  and  reported  on
over 31 cases. In all such investigations,  they  made  recommendations  for
consideration by affected departments and provinces.

In answering the question as to whether service excellence is a  myth  or  a
reality, the PSC sifted through the multiple meaning that people  attach  to
the concept of service delivery. They arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  it
meant service excellence and that it was  an  attainable  reality.  I  think
that this honourable House will agree with them, as I do, the more  so  when
we consider that it is all about performing within norms and  standards  and
always achieving the objectives set within the limitation  of  resources  to
bring about a change for the better in people's lives.

Of course, we may not have shining examples all around us, but we are  proud
of instances such as the Excellency Award ceremony held in Limpopo  province
to honour those outstanding performers.

Hambi yona Ndzawulo ya Dyodzo  eka  Xifundhantsongo  xa  N'walungu-Vuxa  bya

follows.)

[The Department of Education managed to organise a teachers' award  ceremony
at the North East Education Circuit  in  the  Limpopo  province.  It  was  a
teachers', pupils' and  schools'  award  ceremony  for  the  best  teachers,
pupils and schools, those that  excelled  during  2001.  The  function  took
place at the Giyani stadium. This shows  that  whenever  we  speak  of  real
service delivery in a country we are not just dreaming, we are  speaking  of
reality.

Ivy Makhubele, wh is a female student at Nyinisi High  School  in  Nhlaneki,
sang a beautiful song and she was full  of  joy  while  singing.  People  of
different status were encouraged to work hard in order to be  successful.  I
congratulated the whole education circuit and the principal  of  the  above-
mentioned school, Mr Xipetani Nkuna. I want  to  inform  all  South  African
citizens to accept that the success of our country is in everybody's  hands.
We should do away with laziness, gossiping  and  greed,  and  work  for  our
country.]

As I was doing constituency work at Maseke village, in the Phalaborwa  area,
I was impressed by the level of satisfaction of the villagers there  due  to
the electricity and water supply projects by the Department of Minerals  and
Energy and the Department of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,  in  partnership
with Ba-Phalaborwa municipality. All these and  other  unmentioned  delivery
highlights attest to  and  confirm  the  PSC's  understanding  that  service
excellence is an attainable reality.

Of course, the playing field is not smooth.  There  are  serious  challenges
such as the scourge of corruption borne out  of  an  historical  reality  of
decades of this country being ruled by a  politically  corrupt  and  immoral
regime, whose public service was geared towards control and domination,  and
not service-delivery.

As a true partner for service delivery, the PSC is relentlessly leading  the
war against corruption. In his own words, when he was addressing the  global
forum  on  fighting  corruption  and   safeguarding   integrity,   the   PSC
chairperson, Professor Sangweni, said, and I quote:


  To understand our approach to fighting corruption,  it  is  important  to
  also understand that we have  a  proud  history  of  mobilising  ordinary
  citizens, civil society and the  international  community  to  fight  the
  previous corrupt regime. So, fundamental  to  our  approach  to  fighting
  corruption is, again, to mobilise ordinary citizens,  civil  society  and
  the international community.

The ordinary citizens are requested to blow the whistle  on  corruption  and
departments are urged to act on such reports. We must not keep  quiet  about
corruption; we must report it.

The  other  challenge  is  that   of   the   implementation   of   the   PSC
recommendations by Government departments, in which case not  all  is  well.
What is encouraging is that the PSC is developing a tracking system  on  the
implementation of their recommendations and  that  they  chose  to  adopt  a
process of partnering in terms of which departments will be taken  on  board
with regard to implementation arrangements.

We would like to appeal to Government departments not to fear the PSC as  it
is a true partner for service delivery. The PSC is not there  to  police  or
expose them. It wants to be part  of  the  solution  and  not  part  of  the
problem, all for excellence in service delivery.

In its civil  society  mobilisation  effort,  the  PSC  has  introduced  the
concept of public participation forums through which it  will  call  on  the
public to participate by  sharing  their  experiences  about  services  they
receive from the  Public  Service  establishments  with  a  view  to  paying
attention to those areas that might need improvement.

The PSC is now marketing this tool with the full support  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Public Service and Administration. It is  on  record  that  the
PSC has been successful in fulfilling their mandate save for  what  used  to
be a DA-controlled Western Cape provincial government where the work of  the
Public Service Commission was so hampered that they could  not  monitor  the
implementation of the national norms and standards.

It is encouraging, though, now that even in the Western Cape  the  situation
is conducive for the PSC to do  its  work  unhindered  by  the  politics  of
backwardness characteristic of DA's conduct. Once more, the  PSC  should  be
seen for what it is, a true partner for service delivery.

Before I take my seat, I want to address the hon  Bell  on  the  claim  that
when we had provincial visits he observed a problem between the ANC and  the
project organisers at Alexandra township. I want to inform  him  that  there
was no problem between the ANC and the organisers  of  the  project.  As  we
visited the township, all that we saw, to our satisfaction, was the  rebirth
of  Alexandra.  Maybe  hon  Bell  is  not  used  to  situations   in   which
consultation and discussions take place, because  in  his  party  they  only
listen, listen, listen, obey and listen. What actually happened was that  we
had an arrangement to visit that project, where we would receive an  on-site
briefing. That was the only thing. I hope that hon Bell will note  this  and
start to think like an hon member of this House. [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chairperson, in our recent visits as the portfolio  committee
to various institutions falling within the ambits of the Public Service  and
Administration, it was glaringly obvious  that  wherever  senior  management
displayed  certain  qualities,  the  morale  of  the  staff  was  high   and
enthusiasm amongst them went a long  way  towards  overcoming  any  lack  of
experience.

At this stage I interrupt myself  to  single  out  the  director-general  of
Samdi, Mr Tebogo  Mokgoro,  and  the  deputy  director-general,  Ms  Melanie
Bernard-Fryer, for special mention. They obviously,  in  their  performance,
take their example from the Minister. Several speakers have enlarged on  the
work of Samdi and have referred to their  foreign  funding  problems,  so  I
will  not  delve  into  that.  Other  top-rate  performers  in  the  various
departments that we visited will likewise be  held  up  for  praise  in  due
time.

To return to the qualities required in  those  who  hold  senior  management
positions, does a senior manager require the  intellectual  capacity  of  an
Einstein? I would argue that such an  intellectual  giant  is  actually  the
worst manager possible and also far out  of  the  reach  of  the  taxpayer's
wallet. The senior manager with a great fund of logical common sense is  far
more valuable than one who is prone to intellectualise  about  anything  and
everything. One who makes carefully  considered  decisions  based  on  clear
values is a greater asset than one  who  makes  predictable  snap  decisions
shaped by self-serving personal preference.

On the other hand the ability  to  intelligently  interpret  policy  and  to
communicate the same is a sought-after quality, which cannot be expected  of
a dullard. In this  respect  the  senior  management  service,  which  is  a
programme introduced in January last  year  to  professionalise  the  senior
management tier of the Public Service, is a commendable effort.

In the time available I must again touch on the  proposed  restructuring  of
the Public Service. While this is a matter which is still  being  negotiated
at the PSC bargaining council, it has become a source of anxiety  throughout
the service. It is understood that already skilled public servants  are  not
evenly distributed between  and  within  departments,  both  nationally  and
provincially. It has also been argued that the service  is  bloated  because
of the uncertainty of their positions, though rightly  or  wrongly,  several
perceptions have  grown  in  departmental  institutions,  of  which  I  will
mention a few.

Firstly, the Sword of Damocles  looms  over  those  who  dare  perform.  The
perception is that if some Big Brother  decides  that  there  are  too  many
stars shining in one place, the constellation must  be  diffused.  Secondly,
it is widely believed that it is  always  the  more  skilled  and  dedicated
performers who must be thinned out or completely dimmed out.

While the intentions behind the restructuring and  the  bona  fides  of  the
designers of the system are understood  and  above  reproach,  some  thought
must be given  to  the  fact  that,  firstly,  it  takes  time,  effort  and
dedication for any departmental institution to build up a  staff  complement
where the majority function successfully as a co-operative and  stars  begin
to shine. Secondly, distributing the collective acquired skills of  such  an
institution in the hope that the parts count for more than the sum and  that
success can be replicated in this manner  is  counterproductive  because  we
are dealing with people, not automatons. Thirdly, there  is  the  inevitable
loss to the total Public Service system due to the devil of retrenchment.

I would urge the Minister to consider that there is no  quick  fix  for  the
damage that has been done in the course of generations of oppression.  There
is, though, the hope and chance  to  accelerate  transformation  by  firstly
focusing further on skills development, motivation and training where  these
are lacking within the service; secondly, fostering the growth  of  teamwork
by removing uncertainty in the  workplace;  and,  thirdly,  encouraging  the
cross-pollination  of  ideas  and   skills   by   recognising   co-operative
functioning within departmental institutions.

Our illustrious chairman, Mr John Gomomo, has advised about what to do  with
rotten apples. Even then, regrettably, the  process  of  transformation  can
only be hastened, not condensed into a year. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms M A SEECO: Chairperson, the debate on the  Budget  Vote:  Public  Service
and Administration should centre around the aim of the department, which  is
to lead the modernisation of the  Public  Service  by  assisting  Government
departments to implement Government policies in  order  to  improve  service
delivery. The department is to be praised for greater  things  such  as  the
launch of information technology,  projects  which  will  culminate  in  the
implementation of the ideal government strategy. For this purpose the  State
Information Technology Agency will be allocated a substantial chunk  of  the
budget.

In the interests of  good  governance  it  is  important  that  negotiations
between the department and  organised  labour  in  the  Public  Service  are
drawing to a close. We hope at the end of it all, in the Batho Pele  spirit,
we will all be winners.

It is very significant that the core budget will increase annually by  15,5%
between 2001-02 and 2004-05 to reduce its reliance on donor funding, as  has
been the case thus far.  The  UCDP  applauds  the  department  for  engaging
additional staff who will be dedicated to the HIV/Aids action  campaign  and
related issues. The Public Service is  mainly  people-driven  and  therefore
attention has to be given to People First - Batho Pele.

The Public Service Commission, on the other hand, serves as a watchdog  over
the Public Service. It is at pains to root out corruption, to instil a  good
work ethic and to improve the conditions of service of all public  servants.
The PSC will be properly placed in playing  an  active  role  in  the  Moral
Regeneration Movement in the Public Service.

[Mr R J B MOHLALA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  there  is  a
proverb in Sepedi that says one should not trust  one's  friends  too  much.
Today, as we debate the Budget Vote of the Department of Public Service  and
Administration, we should remember that last year we  sat  here  and  talked
about the same things.]

In actual fact I remember that since the last debate one hon member in  this
House is no longer on speaking terms with me.  [Laughter.]  Be  that  as  it
may, the portfolio committee was able to change that hon  member,  and  when
he stood the podium today, I saw a changed person.

Ke humane e le motho yo a titilwego, a hlwekilego fela e le  gore  ga  a  na
hlabego ye ntšinyana. Go ka re nkabe re hlwaetše hlabegonyana mohlomongwe  o

patching up here and there. I wish we had a human  acid  so  that  he  could
ferment into a fully fledged human being. But, he spoke very well.  I  would
not like to mention his name, though.]

When we visited the provinces last year,  we  visited  Khayelitsha,  and  we
visited the Department of Home Affairs in Khayelitsha.  We  were  confronted
with more than a thousand IDs which had  not  been  collected,  and  clearly
this is not acceptable. Our public servants should find a  way  of  ensuring
that the final product that they have developed finds its way to the  people
who are suppose to get it. These are some of the problems. These should  not
be seen as a crisis, but as problems on which we need to sharpen up so  that
we have well-oiled machinery in the Public Service.

Our recent visit to the North West exposed me  to  certain  experiences.  We
visited a small village called Seweding outside Mafikeng.  At  this  village
we were shown a wonderful water project. The villagers, for  a  change,  can
now access tap water. There are several taps laid in the community  so  that
about 200 members of the community can access  clean  water.  But  what  was
very interesting was that one member of the community told us that  when  we
plan, we plan for people only, and we forget that they  have  livestock.  He
explained that one cow drinks about 1 500 litres a day. What  if  there  are
100 cows in the community? The problem with us is that we only plan for  the
people and forget that the cows have to drink water.  [Laughter.]  That  was
one problem.

The other problem that he raised, after a long period of discussion  was  in
the form of a question to us: ``Since your car came  here,  how  many  other
cars have driven down this road?''. We said: ``None, and why are you  asking
us that question?''. He said: ``The nearest clinic is 15  km  away  and  the
nearest school is 20 km away, so if one of you should fall sick,  there  are
no cars. As there is no car passing here, how do you reach the  clinic?''  I
am saying that when one looks at service delivery  these  are  some  of  the
things that we need to sharpen up.

Be that as it may, when we talk about issues we sometimes get  taken  up  by
issues and forget where we  come  from.  We  come  here  and  are  told  the
following: Firstly, that senior ANC  politicians  who  are  incompetent  are
rewarded for their incompetence. Maybe this is a fact,  but  let  us  really
look at the issues. If one looks to my left today,  one  will  realise  that
there is a peculiar absence of very familiar  faces,  and  it  is  not  that
difficult to understand why we do not have the people who  normally  make  a
noise. [Interjections.] There is no noise in this House today,  because  all
the noisemakers, wherever they are, are listening quietly.

Why are they listening? It is because for the first time they are  facing  a
situation where they have to tell this whole world about the type  of  civil
servants they employed, the ones who  would  even  bug  their  offices.  One
cannot afford to have such civil servants. I am happy to say that  they  are
not among the civil servants that we need. When the  President  referred  to
those civil servants who are not prepared to work, - ``ba swanetše  gore  ba
gate kosini'' [they must leave the Public Service] - he meant even the  ones
who are not prepared to work but bug offices.

Ba swanetše gore ba gate kosini. Ka Sepedi re re ge o ka re o bona  mošimane
wa sethakga a kitakita kgauswi le madima, gomme wena wa ba setlatla wa re  o
a mo etša, o tlo wela ka bodibeng. [They must leave the Public  Service.  In
Sepedi we say that if you see someone rejoicing and hopping near  the  river
bank, and you think you could do the same, you will end up drowning.]

In simple terms, in  order  to  assist  those  who  do  not  understand  the
language, who are not as educated as I am ... [Interjections.] I am  saying:
When people do things one must not always try to emulate them,  because  you
might emulate those things which they do, but end up in serious trouble.  We
won the election in the whole country, but they, because they have  a  small
room which makes them think they have won elections at  that  level,  cannot
try and emulate us, as the ones in a bigger house. [Laughter.]

I imagined intelligence as being a national  competency.  But  because  they
think they have a state within a state, they bring their  own  intelligence.
[Interjections.] But because they do not have training  capacity  what  they
do is to go and fetch the dead wood and bring it in. Guess  where  they  are
putting the device? In a strongroom. [Laughter.]

We are told of a shortage of nurses.  I  can  tell  members  that  before  I
became a politician I was once a manager. One can  never  determine  whether
there  is  a  shortage  of  personnel  unless  one  has  the  organisational
structure of that concern. How does one know that there  is  a  shortage  of
nurses? Has one developed new skills? Is one now a sangoma? [Laughter.]  How
does one know? The problem is that we were there. A person who  is  visiting
us sees things that we do not see. The truth of the  matter  is  that  there
are problems in Chris Hani Baragwanath. We saw those  problems,  but  it  is
not a shortage of nurses. What we saw was that the queues  are  still  long.
That needs to be corrected, and we accept that. So what I am saying is ...

Ge nkabe o titietšwe gabotse, Ntate Ben, o be o tla tlogela baoki wa  bolela
seo o se bonego. Bjalo ka go re o motabo ga o  a  kwala,  wena  o  lebeletše
baoki. [Disego.] [If you were a real man, Mr Ben,  you  would  leave  nurses
alone and speak about something that you have seen.  But,  because  you  are
not  well  mixed,  you  have  deviated  and  now  you  talk  about   nurses.
[Laughter.]]

There are other things that we need to indicate. In  the  past  we  used  to
have a typical public servant who behaved like this: We would come  to  work
at 07:45 because that is the time he had to start working, but at  07:45  he
would prepare to drink tea. 08:00 he would  drink  tea  and  continue  until
08:30. At 08:30 he would prepare to work, but  he  would  start  working  at
09:00. At 09:30 he would prepare for tea. He would drink tea from  10:00  to
10:30. At 10:30 he would then one prepare to start working.  He  would  work
from 11:00 to 11:30 and prepare for lunch. If one were to check the rest  of
his programme one would  see  him  preparing  for  tea  at  15:00  and  even
preparing to knock off. The bulk of time was taken  in  preparing,  and  not
working. Now today we have  a  transformed  Public  Service  that  does  not
prepare to work or prepare to drink tea but actually does work most  of  the
time, and we need to commend the organisation for that. [Applause.]

There is one thing that I need to make quite clear before I sit  down.  When
we make public appearances as politicians and go  on  provincial  visits  we
need to develop reports after that and bring the reports here. We must  find
a way of ensuring that whatever  recommendations  are  in  the  report  find
their way into this department.

Bjalo ge, šiba, boTony Leon, ba tloga mo ba ya Delft ba kgobokanya batho  ka
ntlong segalagala, ba dula le bona ba ba botša dilo di ganang  go  fela.  Ge
ba fetša ga go na moo ba yago. Ge e re ke direla batho  dintlo,  ba  tla  ka

ke tša mohuta mang''? Seo ba sa se botsego batho ke go re, bona, ga  se  nke
ba aga le ntlo le e tee. [Now here they are, Tony Leon and company, they  go
to Delft, mobilise the people there and tell them endless stories, but  they
are not going anywhere. When we try to build people houses, they come  after
us and say: ``But these houses are small, What kind of houses  are  these?''
etc. What they do not tell people is that they themselves have  never  built
a single house for anybody.]

Let me share a secret with the House. The DP as a political party has  never
governed. It has never been in government and shall never be in  government.
So why do we listen to people who do not have any experience  in  governing.
We are flogging a dead horse. ``O  šika-šika  lehlabeng.''  [They  are  just
wandering in the desert.]

The DP will never govern, and it has never governed. I would  rather  listen
to the New NP. They governed and messed things up,  and  they  can  tell  us
that they did so. [Applause.] At least they  have  experience  and  will  be
able to warn one and say, ``Do not do as we did there. This is a  mess,  and
we know what we are talking about. That is the right thing  to  do.''  Those
are the people one can listen to, not people  who  know  absolutely  nothing
and say: ``Let us advise you.'' How?

In conclusion ... ka Sepedi  re  re,  tša  bopudi  di  molaleng,  tša  bonku
dibipilwe ka mesela. [... do not wash your dirty linen in public.]

It is easy, when one is transparent, for people to see what one is doing.  I
want to leave members with this saying: It is only when one works  that  one
commits mistakes, and people will realise those mistakes, but if one is  not
working, one will not commit any  mistake.  So  let  us  work  and  let  the
Minister  also  continue  working.  Isukile.  Ke  a  leboga.  [Thank   you.]
[Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chairperson, in  the
spirit of the last input, let me quote Karl Marx:


  Philosophers have only interpreted the world; the thing, however,  is  to
  change it.

I am sure Karl Marx was not referring to the philosophers on  my  left,  but
let them also be counted in that.

I just want to start off with  a  matter  that  was  raised  by  the  Deputy
Speaker. She said that I kept on pointing to the right and  calling  it  the
left. Now, I was a little worried because I thought that  she  may  want  to
suggest that I was dressing up the old in the new.  But  I  thought  that  I
should expose the culprit. Sitting in the  gallery  is  my  mother,  and  my
mother has never been able to tell the  left  from  the  right.  [Laughter.]
When driving she would say turn left, and when we  turned,  she  would  say,
``No, no, I meant the other left''.  [Laughter.]  [Applause.]  I  think  the
Deputy Speaker was reminding me that I also needed to thank her for her  own
role in making possible a lot of what we are all involved in in  many  ways.
I think we see that now in community action and mistake  the  left  for  the
right.

I just want to take this remark a little further.  Normally  those  who  are
involved in the good are situated on the  left.  In  the  instance  of  this
Parliament, I am not looking from the door facing the Speaker,  but  I  have
my back to the Speaker so I made the opposite assumption.
I want to thank everyone for their inputs into the  debate  this  afternoon.
They were generally constructive. I would want to  agree  with  members  and
remind them that last year the hon Comrade Johnny kept on  complaining  that
he was deaf in his left ear. This year, he seems to have lost that  deafness
in his left ear because he has somehow brought everyone from  his  left  ear
onto his right-hand side, I presume.

I want to agree with him and the hon Van Jaarsveld that we do not  have  the
spoilers participating in this debate.  As  was  stated  by  Van  Jaarsveld,
those that come in order to chip away in a narrow sense  did  not  find  the
space here today, because today we were  engaging  quite  constructively  in
the challenge facing the Public Service in this country and what the  issues
are to give  effect  across  the  Public  Service  to  the  challenges.  The
President posed this more directly this week, and I want to quote him:


  We should bring into being a new worker who is capable  of  handling,  in
  addition  to  the  traditional  concerns  of  the  working  people,   the
  complexities of the new economic and  social  reality.  This  new  worker
  should be as concerned with improving his or her lot as he or she  is  in
  working towards the collective good of the nation, the continent and  the
  world.

We do not want the kind of worker that the  hon  Comrade  Johnny  described,
that has tea from morning to afternoon.  Sadly,  some  people  can  actually
identify such  workers.  But  I  think  that  the  message  going  out  this
afternoon is that we are trying to bring into being a new worker and we  are
going to do it together: a worker that has a commitment to the  country,  to
the community and to himself or herself. No longer is  the  work  of  Public
Service  and  Administration  solely   focused   on   internal   regulatory,
structural and system changes within the South African  arena.  Whilst  this
remains important, as we heard earlier  in  the  debate,  our  mandate  goes
beyond  that.  In  our  region,  Nepad  captures  this  as  articulated   by
presidents in our region.

We need to contribute to the general social and economic  upliftment  within
the country, and through ensuring that the most marginalised of  our  people
are receiving better services from Government,  that  they  are  not  inside
strongrooms using  Watchdogs.  I  am  sure  the  hon  deputy  chair  of  the
commission, playing his independent oversight role, could have talked  about
these issues a lot more, as he also  serves  on  that  commission,  ensuring
that our focus is correct and that the challenge of poverty  alleviation  is
the one that we take extremely seriously.

Developing capacity within the Public Service ensures that we are  not  only
making available skills to Government in order to run it  more  effectively,
but also to the broader  economy,  to  build  sustainable  institutions  and
stimulate growth.  Our  human  resource  development  programme,  therefore,
takes into account the  larger  context  within  which  the  development  of
skills of our public servants should take place. The growing recognition  of
the need to place issues of the African continent and the  developing  world
on the international agenda places on us  the  responsibility  not  only  to
consider  local  needs  but  rather  to  constantly  think  regionally   and
globally.

Our development as a nation is intrinsically linked to  the  development  of
our region and of  our  neighbours,  and  therefore  needs  to  be  strongly
informed by our role within the dynamic and  often  difficult  international
arena. So, our commitment to change remains constant, but not  unreflective.
We will not drive a process for change for the sake of being able  later  to
say that things are no longer the same. Change, simply for its own sake,  is
not progress. We are committed to change that results in  a  responsive  and
effective system of governance, skilled and committed public  servants,  and
maximum use of the capacity-building that is required and will take place.

Let me quickly deal with some of the specifics. Let me come to some  of  the
issues that hon Bell raised. The hon member should know  that  some  of  the
concerns he raised about the  anticorruption  programme  are  pertinent  yet
outdated.  They  are  outdated  because  our  anticorruption  programme  has
already been improved, as indicated in my input earlier, as well as  by  the
adoption of the Public Service anticorruption strategy  and  the  submission
of the Prevention of Corruption Bill. I think he should read that  strategy.
I am sure he  may  have  perused  it,  but  he  will  see  in  it  that  the
blacklisting of corrupt individuals and businesses has been  identified  and
dealt with.

We have looked at the improved whistle-blowing mechanism  that  is  required
and the witness protection system, and specific  actions  are  taken  around
that. I think, however, what is necessary to be emphasised  is  that  it  is
not only a Government programme. It is something  that  all  South  Africans
must own, and I hope the chair of the anticorruption forum,  who  represents
civil society, is here today, Advocate Dali  Mpofu,  because  civil  society
and business need to reflect on their inputs. The whole business  survey,  I
think, is an important initiative. On the basis of clear objective  data  we
want to determine the extent of corruption within and  across  business  and
the private sector. We want to look at graft and fraud, but we also  do  not
want to confuse issues and try to suggest that only one group  should  drive
the process.

On financial management training in Samdi, this is a  key  area  for  Public
Service departments. Samdi treats it as such and has hence prioritised  this
training.

On  the  issue  of  what  the  hon  member  called  racial  descriptions  in
Government I want to pause there and say that  nonracialism  does  not  mean
being race blind, just as nonsexism does not mean that we need to be  gender
blind. We are engaged in programmes that have been identified in  the  White
Paper on the Transformation of the Public Service,  in  which  we  laid  out
clear targets on the kind of representativity we want to achieve.

If we want to assess that target,  to  make  sure  that  the  face  and  the
structure of the Public Service are correct, we have  to  determine  whether
and how the various groupings, as we want to ensure their  representativity,
are represented. This is essential and necessary for the  transformation  of
the Public Service. So let us not call race or  gender  blindness  nonsexism
or nonracism. I think Samdi should probably  look  at  running  a  programme
around these issues for some people that we may not want to mention at  this
point in time.

On the Presidential Strategic Leadership Development Programme,  I  want  to
say that it has been extended to previously disadvantaged  universities  and
that Samdi is  working  with  six  of  the  Jupmet  universities,  including
institutions like UWC, UDW and Fort Hare. I think it is  also  necessary  to
say that it is not the University of  Pretoria  that  is  rolling  out  this
programme, but the Open  Learning  Group.  The  University  of  Pretoria  is
accrediting that programme.

On project management, I want to state the obvious as well, namely  that  it
is one of  Samdi's  popular  courses  and  we  will  continue  offering  it.
Somebody made the point that Sita and Samdi are very bad in terms  of  self-
sufficiency, but I am sure the member wanted to say that maybe they are  bad
debt collectors. Maybe they  are  not  just  collecting  money  from  within
Government itself. Let me just reassure the member that  having  heard  what
has been raised, they are going to make  sure  that  they  are  better  debt
collectors. They do not want to behave  like  normal  debt  collectors,  but
they will ensure that money that needs to be transferred is transferred.

I think one of my last few points relates to  the  input  on  HIV/Aids.  The
regulatory provisions  on  the  management  of  HIV/Aids  have  indeed  been
developed in consultation with our  stakeholders  and  are  currently  under
consideration. The standards will take forward an  agreement  that  we  have
reached with unions within the PSCBC and we are  completing  this  within  a
comprehensive workplace manual and focused training programmes.

I would also  like  to  add  something  on  the  issue  of  SMS  performance
management. We listened to the advice given here today  very  carefully.  An
SMS is not the text message on a cellphone.  It  is  the  Senior  Management
Service that was referred to  by  various  members.  The  Senior  Management
Service includes those who are directors and upwards in government. As  from
1 April this year  they  all  have  to  sign  performance  agreements  as  a
mandatory requirement. Those who refuse to enter into such  agreements  will
make themselves guilty of misconduct. I am certain that managers who  really
want to serve will not refuse.

I think I  also  have  to  note,  at  this  point,  that  the  restructuring
framework embodies a number of strategies to  deal  with  the  retention  of
personnel. We are not negotiating it any longer.

We are going to go through various discussions and workshops, and  one  such
will be on 28 May. This framework looks  at  retraining  the  workforce,  in
line with the requirements of posts that are  available.  It  looks  at  the
redeployment of personnel from areas of abundance to areas of need.  It  has
a social plan and it also looks at the human resource  plans  of  individual
departments to ensure that skills that are needed are  retained  within  the
Public Service.

So I want to say, in the  case  of  those  who,  according  to  the  hon  Mr
Abrahams, perform well but have the sword of  Damocles  hanging  over  their
heads, challenging them to perform, let the  hon  member  come  and  have  a
discussion with me. Let us talk about those departments. Let us  talk  about
those individuals because we do not want any sword hanging  over  those  who
should remain.

I would want to say again, in  conclusion,  that  I  proudly  lead  quite  a
competent team. The teams with me would sometimes say that they think  I  am
pushing too hard. But I think that as they listened  here  today  they  will
know that the need is great, and so is the impatience. But we are not  going
to try and get water to jump across the gully. We are  going  to  do  things
correctly, but we do need to deal  with  them  with  some  speed.  Efficient
service delivery is a right that our people deserve and a  right  that  they
need. So I thank them for their work. My impatience will not stop, but  they
will listen to the voices of the people all the time.

Again, to those who walk the extra mile over and above the call of duty,  it
is greatly appreciated. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  Minister,  you  have  just
confirmed to all of us that a  mother's  influence  is,  indeed,  a  lasting
influence.

Debate concluded.

Minister Balfour, the Minister of Sport and Recreation, has requested me  to
announce to the House that Bafana Bafana won  their  match  against  Turkey.
[Applause.] If it matters to you, they won by two goals to nil.  [Applause.]


The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION:  Chairperson,  on  a
point of intervention - I  apologise  for  interrupting  -  I  think  it  is
necessary for us all to toast Bafana's win. Everyone  is  therefore  welcome
to join us at the cocktail party. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, do  you  see  what
happens when Bennie McCarthy scores both goals? You are  the  beneficiaries.
You are the beneficiaries and you are invited to toast this victory.

Furthermore, the Minister said that the  overall  performance  of  the  team
during the match leaves us, and these are his own words, ``without  a  doubt
that the team is maturing, and if today's performance is anything to go  by,
they will be a force at the World Cup and South Africans  will  have  plenty
to look forward to''. [Applause.]

Yes, we indeed wish them well.
