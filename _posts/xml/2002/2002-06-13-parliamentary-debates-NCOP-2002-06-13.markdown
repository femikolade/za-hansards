                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Mr Chairperson, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) believes that the large number of  applicants  for  West  Coast  rock
       lobster quotas in areas east of Cape Hangklip is a  clear  indication
       that the people were not  aware  or  informed  of  Regulation  50  of
       Government Gazette No 19205 of 2 September 1998, and  were  also  not
       aware that legislation prohibits  exploitation  of  West  Coast  rock
       lobster in this zone;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)   people  have  paid  application  fees  of  R6  000  and   R500,
           respectively;


       (b)   because  the  results  of  research  had  been  positive,   the
           Department promised to look into  the  matter  ``early  in  this
           year";


       (c)  the DA has expressed concern about the fact that no  allocations
           have been made although  the  West  Coast  rock  lobster  season
           closes at the end of June; and


       (d)  experimental quotas have been granted without  any  transparency
           or by using set criteria; and
  (3) therefore calls on Marine and Coastal Management to -


       (a)  expedite this matter as soon as possible; and


       (b)  give back the money to the unsuccessful applicants.

                           DROWNINGS AT INANDA DAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness the death of three men who drowned at  Inanda  Dam
       in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) expresses condolences to their families, colleagues and  friends  who
       are affected by their death; and
  (3) calls on the authorities to launch a thorough investigation into  the
       incident.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 27 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism:

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Mr Chairperson, MECs  and
hon members, I would like to begin my address by quoting section 24  of  the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa:


  Everyone has the right -


  (a) to an environment that is not harmful to their health  or  wellbeing;
       and
  (b) to have the environment protected for  the  benefit  of  present  and
       future generations, through reasonable legislative and other measures
       that -


       (i)  prevent pollution and ecological degradation;
       (ii) promote conservation; and
       (iii)      secure ecologically sustainable  development  and  use  of
              natural resources while  promoting  justifiable  economic  and
              social development.

This is the text of section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of  South
Africa. Our Constitution is  one  of  the  few  in  the  world  to  entrench
environmental rights  as  a  fundamental  human  right.  In  doing  so,  the
Constitution gives expression to the deep love of  the  environment  by  the
citizens of this country. It also gives recognition to the valuable  natural
heritage and unique biodiversity of South Africa. Our Constitution,  in  the
same  section,  promotes  the  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources  and
requires social and economic development.

The Constitution provides a clear framework for the policies  and  the  work
of the Department of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism.  South  Africa  is
experiencing a tidal wave of public concern and support for  the  protection
of our environment and,  therefore,  for  the  full  implementation  of  the
Constitution. The Constitution assigns the responsibility for  environmental
protection to all three spheres of government. This gives a special role  to
the National Council of Provinces in this area. We should  take  pride  that
our Constitution calls for conservation and environmental protection  within
the context of sustainable development. In this  regard  it  compels  us  to
protect the environment and also promote social and economic development.

In just over two months world leaders and thousands of  people  will  gather
in Johannesburg for the World Summit on Sustainable  Development  under  the
slogan ``People, Planet, Prosperity''. The fourth and final  United  Nations
Preparatory Committee meeting for the Summit - the  so-called  PrepCom  4  -
ended just under a week ago in Bali, Indonesia. The lengthy  and  exhaustive
global preparatory process gives us the broad parameters of the Summit.

Everyone  agrees  that  the  Johannesburg   Summit   must   be   about   the
implementation of measures to realise sustainable development.  Everyone  is
in agreement that poverty eradication should be the  central  focus  of  the
Summit. Everyone is in agreement that the Summit should emerge  with  a  set
of concrete,  measurable,  resourced  and  time-bound  action  plans,  among
others, in the following  fields:  water  and  sanitation,  energy,  health,
agriculture and food security, and biodiversity. Everyone agrees that  these
massive challenges require a partnership between governments  of  the  North
and the South, and  between  governments,  civil  society  and  the  private
sector.

At PrepCom 4 there was  less  agreement  on  the  financing  of  sustainable
development  and  on  measures  that  would  promote  economic  development.
Without economic growth, development is unsustainable. Some of  the  biggest
obstacles to poverty eradication are unsustainable levels of national  debt,
the lack of a fair and equitable  global  trade  regime,  and  the  lack  of
market access. Producers in poor  countries,  especially  farmers,  are  not
able to sell their  produce  to  consumers  in  rich  countries  because  of
agricultural subsidies in developed countries.

Aid from the rich to the poor is important and must be increased. Of  equal,
if not greater, importance is the  need  to  remove  obstacles  to  economic
activity in developing countries. Today, developing countries lose far  more
as a result of trade barriers than they gain in the form of  aid.  To  quote
Time Magazine of 10 June 2002:


  In 1999 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  concluded
  that for each dollar developing countries receive in aid they lose up  to
  $14 just because of  trade  barriers  imposed  on  the  export  of  their
  manufactured goods.

While  some  of  these  matters  must  be  negotiated  in  the  World  Trade
Organisation, a summit on sustainable development cannot be silent  on  such
obstacles to poverty eradication.

The Johannesburg World Summit will be an opportunity for the formation of  a
global partnership to roll back poverty. I am confident that  world  leaders
gathered in Johannesburg will send  a  message  of  hope  to  the  poor  and
destitute and thereby open a new chapter in human solidarity.

It is an enormous privilege for South Africa  to  host  the  biggest  global
gathering. It provides  a  unique  opportunity  for  the  promotion  of  our
country as a tourism destination and as a place to do  business.  All  South
Africans should spare no effort in doing what will enhance the image of  our
country. We believe that the summit will  constitute  a  net  economic  gain
rather than simply a financial burden on the taxpayer.

I would like to take  this  opportunity  to  express  my  gratitude  to  the
Gauteng government for its financial contribution and the enthusiasm  it  is
displaying in the preparations. One of the innovative contributions  of  the
province is the Greening the WSSD project. This will set a new  standard  in
the  minimisation  of  the  environmental  impact  of   large   events   and
conferences. I must also express gratitude to  the  Johannesburg  metro  for
the invaluable support it is giving to the success of the summit.

The financing and organising of the summit is a practical  manifestation  of
section 41(1)(h)ii of the Constitution, which goes:


  All spheres of Government and all organs of state within each sphere must
  co-operate with one another in mutual trust and good faith  by  assisting
  and supporting one another.

Let us turn to the constitutional imperative  to  promote  conservation  and
prevent ecological degradation. South Africa  is  considered  as  a  country
with megabiodiversity. It is the third most biodiverse in  the  world.  This
is by far our richest natural resource. If used  in  a  sustainable  manner,
our natural resources can yield social and economic benefits for us and  for
future generations.

Today South Africa protects its biodiversity and the wonders  of  nature  by
employing a range of tools. These include  national  parks,  provincial  and
municipal parks, transfrontier conservation areas, biosphere reserves  which
allow for mixed land use  within  a  conservation  area,  contractual  parks
where land is the  property  of  the  community,  private  nature  reserves,
marine  protected  areas,  the  listing  of  world   heritage   sites,   the
implementation of international rules for the trade in  endangered  species,
the world renowned Working for Water and Working  for  Wetlands  programmes,
the collection and research work of the National Botanical Institution,  the
marine  research  of  the  Marine  and  Coastal  Management  branch  of  the
department and the research work and  breeding  projects  of  South  African
National Parks and provincial conservation authorities. We are living  at  a
time when the frontiers of conservation in South Africa continue to expand.

In June last year the governments of Lesotho and South Africa set in  motion
the process of establishing the Maluti-Drakensberg/Ukhahlamba  transfrontier
conservation area covering over 8 000 km2. This brings  the  mountain  range
across both countries under a common conservation strategy. The creation  of
the  Ais-Ais-Richtersveld  transfrontier  park  between  Namibia  and  South
Africa is progressing. It is  my  intention  that  the  international  trade
agreement between the two countries be signed this year.

The department will also intensify its work with  provinces  this  year.  We
will continue our discussions with the Eastern Cape province with a view  to
establishing the Pondoland National Park as part of the economic  growth  of
the Wild Coast. This will be done in the spirit of co-operative  governance.
The Pondoland Centre of Biodiversity and Endemism supports 1 500 species  of
plants, of which 8% are endangered. The rugged landscapes  of  plateaus  and
deeply dissected river gorges  are  particularly  spectacular.  Its  tourism
potential is far from being realised. We will also pursue  discussions  with
the Mpumalanga province on the  protection  of  the  Sabie  River  catchment
area, which  is  continuous  with  the  Blyde  River  Nature  Reserve.  This
ecologically sensitive area, which was decimated by the commercial  forestry
practices  of  the  apartheid  government,  has  already  been  returned  to
conservation.

The aim of establishing a representative sample of biodiversity in a  system
of protected areas will be provided for the Protected  Areas  Bill  which  I
intend tabling in Parliament during  the  course  of  this  year.  Extensive
consultations  with   provincial   MECs   have   already   been   conducted.
Conservation  and  economic  development  must  go   hand   in   hand.   Our
conservation areas, rather than being burden on taxpayers,  must  contribute
to job creation and socioeconomic  upliftment.  Our  natural  heritage  must
continue to serve as a foundation for  the  tourism  industry.  The  natural
beauty, together with our  cultural  life  and  warm  hospitality,  is  fast
making us a tourism destination of note.

South Africa is currently experiencing a tourism boom. Our performance  this
year has been particularly good. The tragic  events  of  11  September  last
year have repositioned South Africa in the eyes of the  world.  There  is  a
positive sentiment in the air. It is therefore my pleasure to announce a  7%
overall increase in foreign tourist arrivals in  the  first  two  months  of
this year.

More than 106 000 tourists from the UK and Germany, two of  our  traditional
core markets, visited South Africa in  January  and  February.  This  is  an
increase of more than 21% over the same period in 2001.  In  line  with  our
new tourism growth strategy, there was also impressive growth from Asia  and
Africa - two regions where we believe there is  tremendous  opportunity  for
tourism.  In  line  with  the  Approved  Destination  Status  Agreement  our
President signed with the People's Republic of China during his state  visit
last year, visitors from China have increased by  63.5%  in  the  first  two
months of this year. We believe these figures will continue  to  grow  after
we have signed the MOU with the  Chinese  national  tourism  authority,  and
give us the ability of becoming one of  20  countries  who  are  allowed  to
market to the more than 10 million Chinese who take holidays every year.

There has also been more than 20% growth out of Hong Kong and  India  during
the same period. The highest increase worldwide came from Botswana,  with  a
35% increase, bringing arrivals from that country to  South  Africa  to  114
000 out of a country of just about 1,5  million  people.  The  proximity  of
Gaborone and Lobatse to Zeerust  and  Mafikeng  means  that  many  of  these
people are day-trippers. However, these visitors play a significant role  in
the economies of these North  West  province  towns.  Significant  increases
were also reported from Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Swaziland,  Zambia  and
Zimbabwe.

With major events like  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  in
August and the Cricket World Cup due in February next year, we are  uniquely
placed to benefit from the positive sentiment towards South Africa.  Tourism
has the potential to create opportunities for SMMEs and we must continue  to
exploit this. I am pleased that as  a  result  of  Government  intervention,
about  200  black-owned  enterprises  were  given  international   marketing
exposure at this year's Tourism Indaba.

One of the questions many  ask  is  where  and  how  a  tourism  SMME  finds
support. In answer to this question the department has published  a  booklet
which for the first time provides a consolidated set of information  on  all
Government and government-related support programmes. A database  of  black-
owned tourism enterprises has been compiled in order  to  assist  Government
departments to meet affirmative procurement targets. The booklet is  already
in reprint now, but all of this information is  available  on  our  website,
which, as hon members should know, is www.environment.gov.za.

A public-private tourism transformation  forum  to  promote  black  economic
empowerment has been established with representation  from  the  department,
from the Tourism Business Council, the Development  Bank  of  South  Africa,
the Industrial Development Corporation and  the  Departments  of  Trade  and
Industry and Labour. At the recent meeting of  the  tourism  Minmec  it  was
decided to encourage South African cities to take active  steps  to  promote
themselves as destinations.

Our major cities are all tourism destinations in their own right and  should
be promoted as such. Cities  like  Durban  and  Cape  Town  are  setting  an
excellent example for others to follow. In  promoting  our  cities  we  must
avoid destructive competition between cities. I would like to  call  on  the
major cities to improve  their  co-operation  and  co-ordination  with  each
other. Surely, if  South  Africa  as  a  country  can  co-operate  with  our
neighbouring countries in a mutually reinforcing manner, then it is not  too
much to ask of our cities.

Innovation and product  development  must  continue  to  receive  attention.
Recently we launched the Coast2Coast route. This route follows a  3  000  km
tarred road starting in Maputo and  travelling  through  Swaziland,  through
Mpumalanga, Gauteng and the North West province  in  South  Africa,  through
Botswana on the  Trans-Kalahari  highway  and  through  Namibia,  ending  in
Walvis Bay. Marketed as ``All of Africa on  one  Road'',  the  richness  and
diversity together with its accessibility give it the potential  to  be  one
of the world's great journeys. This  is  yet  another  example  of  regional
solidarity in tourism. It is a project involving five  SADC  countries.  The
successful marketing of South Africa as a tourism destination is central  to
our growth strategy.

In order to indicate the importance  Government  attaches  to  this,  it  is
indeed my pleasure to announce that Cabinet has decided to  appoint  one  of
the most respected private sector  leaders,  Mr  Rick  Menell,  as  the  new
chairperson of the SA Tourism Board. His appointment is  also  another  step
in the  promotion  of  the  government-private  sector  partnership  in  the
promotion of tourism growth. May I take this opportunity to congratulate  Mr
Menell and express gratitude at his willingness to serve in this capacity.

The Minmec has agreed that the annual celebration of World  Tourism  Day  on
27 September will rotate amongst provinces. This year we will celebrate  the
day at Bakgatla Village in the North West province.  This  year's  theme  is
``Responsible Tourism''. We  will  highlight  the  benefits  of  responsible
tourism to communities and the country as a whole. We  will  also  encourage
South Africans to be tourists in their own country, city, town and in  their
own province.

As we announced last year, the allocation of  long-term  fishing  rights  is
now complete. The process undertaken constitutes both  a  modernisation  and
deep  transformation  of  the  fishing   industry.   The   introduction   of
predictability,  transparency  and  fairness  into  the  rights   allocation
process has resulted in stability  in  the  industry.  For  the  first  time
fishing enterprises are able to  take  rational  investment  decisions.  The
transformation of the industry is indeed far-reaching.  In  the  hake  trawl
sector, which is the biggest in fishery,  73%  of  all  rights  holders  are
majority black-owned concerns. During the  apartheid  era  the  total  catch
allowable was divided amongst only six white-owned companies. This  year  51
companies have been allocated hake trawl quotas. This is the  general  trend
in most other fishing sectors.

Now that the allocations for fishing rights have been completed, I have,  in
terms of the Marine Living  Resources  Act,  received  1  500  appeals  from
persons and companies not satisfied with the decisions of the department.  I
will give consideration to the  grounds  of  each  appeal  and  ensure  that
everybody gets a fair deal. Thus far  I  have  already  taken  decisions  on
about 600 appeals, each one of which was signed off by myself personally.

South Africa has among the best-managed fish stocks in the world. This  year
I have been able to determine a record total allowable a catch  of  258  000
tons, an increase of 76 000 tons  from  2001  in  the  pilchards  sector.  I
further determined the TAC for anchovies for 2002 to be 260 000  tons.  This
makes the  total  pelagic  catch,  which  is  pilchards  and  anchovies  put
together, 158% higher than the 1994 figures. And  this  is  largely  due  to
sound fisheries management. This comes at a time when half of  the  European
fishing fleet is at a standstill as a result of Europe having had to  reduce
their total allowable catch. This follows years of reckless  overfishing  by
Europeans. As hon members may be aware,  Europe  has  asked  for  access  to
South African waters as part of the  EU-South  Africa  trade  agreement.  We
have refused and have no intention of changing our minds.

The illegal poaching of abalone is a matter that should concern us all.  The
department has embarked on  a  combined  operation  with  the  SAPS,  called
Operation Neptune, which combats the poaching of  abalone  as  part  of  our
efforts to protect this precious resource  from  extinction.  The  operation
has been highly successful and has led to large amounts of  poached  abalone
being seized and numerous arrests made.

However, despite the best efforts of Operation Neptune the abalone  resource
remains  under  extreme  pressure.  Criminals  continue  to  brazenly  poach
abalone, denying many  coastal  communities  the  opportunity  of  making  a
living from the  proper  and  sustainable  exploitation  of  this  resource.
Unless urgent  steps  are  taken  abalone  could  soon  become  commercially
extinct. For these reasons I am implementing  further  measures  to  curtail
the poaching of this valuable resource.

In order to ensure that the punishment meted  out  by  the  courts  has  the
required deterrent effect I am  requesting  the  Department  of  Justice  to
ensure that sentences for those persons convicted of  poaching  abalone  are
significantly increased. I am also requesting the Department of  Justice  to
consider establishing specialised courts to deal with abalone  poaching  and
related offences.

Two advocates experienced in  conducting  criminal  prosecutions  have  been
appointed to assist the  Department.  Their  primary  task  is  to  increase
significantly the conviction  rate  of  those  who  plunder  South  Africa's
valuable  fish  stocks  with  particular  emphasis  on  those  charged  with
offences related to the poaching of abalone.
I am pleased to announce to the House that an  important  initiative  by  my
department in the Eastern Cape region  has  been  taken.  The  Eastern  Cape
Abalone Management  Plan  is  aimed  at  developing  a  sustainable  abalone
fishery. This project is run on co-management principles  and  will  further
increase access to marine  resources  by  previously  disadvantaged  coastal
communities.

Many people have  raised  concern  as  a  result  of  recent  media  reports
suggesting that South Africa supports commercial whaling. May  I  take  this
opportunity to make our position clear  on  this  matter.  South  Africa  is
opposed to the hunting of whales. [Applause.] We do not  allow  the  hunting
of whales in South African waters. We will not  support  any  proposal  from
any country to hunt whales. South Africa last year declared its first  whale
sanctuary in Walker Bay so as to provide a safe haven for  the  breeding  of
whales. Our position is not about to change.

There  has  also  been  much  concern  recently  about  reported  cases   of
``canned'' lion hunting. The hunting of lions in confined spaces  and  those
that have been drugged or lured with rotting meat is an outrage and must  be
condemned.  [Applause.]  It  is  simply   unacceptable   that   unscrupulous
operators are able to engage in this  practice.  As  this  is  a  provincial
competence I hereby call on provinces to take legal and other steps to  curb
this practice, which can only serve to harm our otherwise respected  tourism
industry.

The Ministry and the department will continue to find ways of  communicating
with the public. This year we participated actively in the imbizo  week.  We
have also placed a special emphasis  on  community  radio  stations  in  all
languages and we provide information on our website.  In  order  to  improve
our communication and in  order  to  promote  a  narrowing  of  the  digital
divide, for the information of the hon Rev  Moatshe,  I  will  be  appearing
live once a week on the department's internet chatroom.  Every  Monday,  for
the next three months, from 05h00 pm to 06h00 pm, any member of  the  public
will be able to log on to the site and chat live with  me.  Again,  the  web
address is www.environment.gov.za.
In June last year I  announced  the  Government's  intention  to  set  up  a
competition that would get South Africans excited about  cleaning  up  their
environment, the so-called Cleanest Town Competition.  The  competition  was
aimed at encouraging the nation to take  pride  in  their  surroundings  and
work together with Government in cleaning up their  towns.  The  competition
was greeted with much enthusiasm and in the process the department  achieved
its objective, that is, to raise awareness of the  importance  and  benefits
of a clean  environment  and  urge  people  to  change  their  attitude  and
behaviour towards their surroundings. The winners were  announced  on  World
Environment Day, 5 June 2002, and  therefore  I  would  like  to  take  this
opportunity,  and  I  hope  hon  members  will  join  me  in  doing  so,  to
congratulate the winners in the three categories.

In  the  district  council  category  the  winner  of  the   Cleanest   Town
Competition is the Karoo District Municipality.  [Applause.]  In  the  local
municipality category the  winner  of  the  Cleanest  Town  Competition  was
announced as the Newcastle Local Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal.  [Applause.]
In the metropolitan  council  category  the  winner  of  the  Cleanest  Town
Competition was announced as the Nelson Mandela  Metropole  in  the  Eastern
Cape. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Chief M L MOKOENA: We was robbed! [Laughter.]

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I can see the welcome enthusiasm from members  of
the NCOP and I should inform them that  this  was  the  first  year  of  the
running of the competition and these three municipalities will be the  title
holders for a full year  and  thereafter  we  will  have  a  new  round.  So
Limpopo, Mpumalanga and other provinces have an  opportunity  to  get  ready
for that. [Laughter.]

May I take this opportunity to report to you, Chairperson, and to the  NCOP,
that this country has, without exception, a dedicated team of MECs  both  in
environment and tourism. They are women and  men  who  do  not  hesitate  to
challenge the national Government in the interest of  their  provinces,  but
each one has always placed the interest of the country first. It is  a  team
that I have received co-operation from and one I truly enjoy working with.

May I also use this opportunity to thank the team in the department  and  in
the Ministry and all of the institutions  linked  with  the  department  for
their dedication and patriotism.

Finally, I would like to thank Rev Moatshe and the  members  of  the  select
committee, who have done their work in a manner which has supported  us  and
which has displayed diligence. [Applause.]

Frogs and crabs should cry with their big voices  to  inform  the  community
about South Africa's tourism.]

Given the fact that the UN conference on sustainable  development  is  about
to take place in South Africa it is perhaps  appropriate  to  start  off  by
reflecting  on   the   relationships   between   tourism   and   sustainable
development.  There  are  conflicting  views  on  whether  tourism  has  the
potential to advance sustainable development.

On  the  one  hand  there  are  those,  including   governments,   business,
international lending organisations and economists,  who  have  consistently
emphasised the economic potential  of  tourism.  Environmentalists,  on  the
other hand, have frequently questioned the prospects for  national  economic
development and have pointed out  the  environmental  costs  of  tourism  to
local communities.

Whatever argument one supports it is undeniable that tourism constitutes  an
essential sector of  our  national  economy.  Tourism  generates  a  lot  of
foreign exchange earnings, as well as  employment  and  income  for  certain
sections of our population.

Moreover, in the context of rapid global  integration  and  developments  in
transport  and  communication  systems,  further  expansion  of  tourism  is
inevitable.

The challenge this places before us is, how do we manage  the  expansion  of
tourism to South Africa to the benefit of  sustaining  the  environment  and
livelihood of future generations?

Since  1994  substantial  efforts  have  been  made  by  our  Government  to
integrate environmental,  economic  and  social  objectives  into  decision-
making. We have witnessed a  shift  to  a  more  holistic  and  co-ordinated
approach to environmental issues, including in the growth area of tourism.

The  driving  forces  behind  this  shift  were  the  establishment   of   a
constitutional right to a clean  environment  and  the  realisation  of  the
positive role the environment and tourism can play  in  the  alleviation  of
poverty and the fulfilment of basic human rights.

Indeed, the statistics  have  shown  how  successful  tourism  has  been  in
reducing poverty through job creation.  According  to  the  department  more
than R130  million  has  already  been  spent  towards  tourism  development
projects aimed at creating jobs and alleviating poverty.  Current  estimates
indicate that tourism employs at least 7% of South  Africa's  workforce.  It
is  projected  that  this  will  grow  to  about  1,2   million   employment
opportunities by 2010.

Small, micro and medium enterprises is  another  major  beneficiary  of  the
department's tourism programmes. Already some 227 SMMEs have  been  assisted
with funding to the value of R22 million. It is expected  that  this  number
will also grow  dramatically  as  we  tap  further  into  the  vast  tourism
potential of many rural villages and townships across our country.

These are tremendous achievements and we should commend the  department  for
the opportunities it has created for ordinary people. At the  same  time  we
must also commend it for trying to balance the  need  for  greater  economic
participation  and  human  development  with  the  need   to   sustain   our
environment.

There is absolutely no lack of commitment  on  the  part  of  Government  to
promote human development within a  sustainable  development  framework.  We
have an impressive array of policies and mechanisms which serves as a  broad
framework within which we balance the social and economic  development  with
environmental protection.

I would like to highlight the key  aspects  of  this  broad  framework.  The
National Environmental Management Act has been implemented, which  sets  out
the principles in terms of which environmental management and planning  must
take place. All organs of state have to comply with the principles  of  this
Act in decision-making.

We also have the Marine Living Resources Act, which aims to conserve  marine
ecosystems,  promote  the  long-term  sustainable  use  of   marine   living
resources and provide for  orderly  access,  exploitation,  utilisation  and
protection of marine living resources.

The  National  Forests  Act  seeks  to  provide   for   sustainable   forest
management. The National Water  Act  aims  to  manage  the  country's  water
resources to  meet  a  wide  range  of  objectives  including  basic  needs,
equitable  access,  facilitating  social  and   economic   development   and
preventing pollution.

Strategic environmental assessments have been  used  by  the  Department  of
Trade and Industry in co-operation  with  the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs  and  Tourism  as  an  environmental  management  tool  in   spatial
development initiatives. These initiatives are investment  strategies  aimed
at  identifying  and  unlocking  inherent  economic  potential  in  specific
spatial locations. An integrated and co-operative approach to  environmental
protection is also evident in the relationship with the business  community.
The Industrial Development Corporation encourages sustainable production  by
means  of  low-interest  financing  schemes  for  environmentally   friendly
products.

Our metals  industry  sector  has  introduced  a  number  of  incentives  to
encourage research, innovation  and  manufacturing  partnerships  that  will
enhance sustainable production, while an encouraging  number  of  industries
have on a voluntary basis  adopted  environmental  management  measures  and
systems. Another incentive to promote sustainable  development  is  unleaded
petrol which is made available to motorists cheaper than leaded  petrol.  We
also have a code of practice for mine residue deposits of the South  African
Bureau of Standards to regulate mine residue  deposits  and  to  reduce  its
environmental impact.
Government have ratified a number of international treaties  such  as  Cites
and the Kyoto Protocol which deal with the protection of endangered  species
and the ozone layer, respectively. Other environmental policies include  new
policies on minerals, energy,  biological  diversity,  integrated  pollution
control and waste management and coastal management.

Lastly, all these new policies act as a statement of  intent  by  Government
to accelerate economic growth and raise the standard  of  living,  while  at
the same time minimising damage to our environment.

Ms M E METCALFE (Gauteng): Chairperson, before I begin, I  would  like  just
to honour Peter Mokaba. I know there was  a  memorial  service  for  him  in
Parliament just before this sitting. But I think it is appropriate  that  in
this debate on the Budget Vote for Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,  we
particularly remember the role that Peter Mokaba  played  in  terms  of  the
Consultative National Environmental  Policy,  or  Connep,  process  and  the
leadership that he gave to environmental issues in the time in which he  was
the Deputy Minister for Environmental Affairs and Tourism. He was  a  person
of enormous passion and capacity  for  persuasion  and  charm.  I  think  he
brought all of that to his work in the Connep process and a  wide  range  of
participants in that process would certainly have wanted us  to  acknowledge
his role, because it was so deeply respected.

I am  not  sure  that  I  can  match  the  previous  speaker,  Rev  Moatshe,
particularly the praise poem to nature that he began with, but I do want  to
join him in congratulating the  hon  the  Minister  on  the  extraordinarily
useful work that is being done by this department under  his  leadership.  I
know that he is passionate about nature for tourism and tourism for  nature,
and the enormous success that we are achieving as a country.

With regard to the very good appointments that he has made recently,  it  is
wonderful to have Cheryl Carolus in South  African  Tourism  and  using  her
enormous talents and creativity in that role. Together with all  members  of
the NCOP, I want to join him in thanking the previous chairperson  of  South
African Tourism, Saki Macozoma, for the role that  he  has  played.  I  also
want to recognise the work that he has done  in  terms  of  putting  on  the
public consciousness our very wasteful relationship with resources  in  this
country.

Despite the high levels of poverty, it is amazing  to  me  that  we  are  so
careless with our natural resources, and the very  bold  step  that  he  has
taken in terms of saying that plastic bags must cease being  the  carelessly
disposed-of national flower, but must instead be seen  as  a  resource  that
must be reused over and over again and be recycled, is  an  important  entry
point into  a  much  more  environmentally  sustainable  approach  to  waste
management, one with an emphasis on reuse and recycling. Also,  I  think  it
has just been something that has captured the public  imagination  in  terms
of beginning to understand those issues. Despite the  battles  that  he  has
had, we do want to acknowledge the boldness of that step.

In terms of the very good work being done by  the  department  in  providing
the leadership around the World Summit on Sustainable Development,  I  would
like to thank the hon  the  Minister  for  acknowledging  the  work  of  the
province and of Johannesburg in Gauteng, in terms of  preparations  for  the
summit, in particular the acknowledgement of the  greening  initiative.  The
greening initiative is one attempt to try and create a legacy for the  world
summit  that  will  go  beyond  the  declaration,  as  important   as   that
declaration might be. We hope that part of the legacy of having  the  summit
in this country will be a heightened public consciousness in  terms  of  the
need for sustainable  development  and  the  roles  that  we  need  to  play
individually and collectively towards contributing to the  development  that
is built on pillars of  awareness  of  economic,  social  and  environmental
sustainability.

It is a great privilege for me to come and join my colleagues  from  Gauteng
in the NCOP. I  believe  that  the  NCOP  is  a  very  important  forum  for
achieving  the  kind  of  commitment  to  co-operative  governance  that  is
enshrined in the Constitution. I  was  struck  by  the  hon  the  Minister's
comment that, in fact,  constitutionally,  environmental  issues  do  reside
with all three levels of government and that therefore there  is  a  special
role for the NCOP. I think from my experience in  two  portfolio  committees
in Government, that I would say that the environment is probably one of  the
most complex in terms of allocation of responsibilities.  It  is  much  more
complex than any other portfolio that I can think of. Maybe I am  wrong  and
as I gain more experience  and  come  into  contact  with  more  enlightened
members I shall become aware of that, but it seems to me that  environmental
issues really do need to be much more deeply understood amongst  all  of  us
who participate in the NCOP.

Despite the very  good  working  relationship  we  have  with  the  hon  the
Minister in forums such as the Minmec, I often feel  that  we  do  not  have
enough time to talk about all of those issues that  should  concern  all  of
us. I note that the hon the Minister said that he was going to be  available
one hour per week in the chat room. [Interjections.] Perhaps I am  going  to
be making use of that opportunity to make sure that we do  share  much  more
information.

The  chairperson  of  the  standing  committee  spoke  about  the  important
mechanism of the strategic environmental assessments. At the moment  we  are
working in the Vaal area, which I know the hon  the  Minister  has  a  great
passion about in terms of air quality. I think, in the case of  those  kinds
of mechanisms, particularly  where  there  is  environmental  responsibility
that has to be shared between two provinces, because  air  and  water  float
freely across the borders that we have constructed, it is important that  we
do have opportunities to talk about them.

It is very important that we have  opportunities  to  talk  about  the  very
innovative policy work that is happening in different provinces  and  indeed
in some local municipalities. I want to thank the hon the  Minister  for  an
innovation of his in the way that we manage our  Minmecs.  The  last  Minmec
took place in the Eastern Cape and it happened over  several  days  so  that
there was plenty of time for debate and discussion.

One of the things that I found very interesting in  that  lekgotla  that  we
had in the Eastern Cape, was  beginning  to  unpack  together  some  of  the
constitutional complexities of environmental responsibilities. I think  that
when we start the critical process, as we must begin to, of looking  at  the
Constitution, I would challenge the NCOP and our hon members here,  to  look
very critically at how environmental responsibilities are  allocated  within
the Constitution. If we look,  for  example,  at  the  schedule  that  gives
exclusive  responsibilities  to  provinces,  and  in  particular  to   local
authorities, we will see that there is an emphasis on air pollution being  a
local government responsibility, whereas simple  logic  would  suggest  that
because movements of air indeed not only cross local government  boundaries,
but also provincial boundaries, there clearly does need to be a very  strong
role for national Government in  establishing  frameworks  and  a  role  for
provincial governments.

I want to applaud the hon the Minister for the fact  that  and  the  way  in
which he is taking forward the law reform  process  which  is  looking  very
thoroughly and  conscientiously  across  the  responsibilities  that  should
logically reside at the different levels of local, provincial  and  national
government and the challenges that  that  would  indeed  pose,  even  for  a
process of constitutional revision. Some of the added complexities in  terms
of  function  have  to  do  with  the  very  different   environmental   and
conservation challenges that are  experienced  in  different  provinces  and
perhaps different local authorities.

Gauteng is a province which is under extreme environmental stress. It  is  a
very highly populated province. There are very  high  levels  of  industrial
and mining activities, and there are very  high  levels  of  vehicle  usage,
which in itself contributes to problems in terms of pollution  from  vehicle
emissions.
I think that one of the challenges that the hon  the  Minister  does  indeed
face, is how to put into place legal frameworks on a national basis that  do
take into account  the  high  levels  of  variation  and  complexity  across
different provinces. As the  hon  the  Minister  is  aware,  some  of  those
national framework laws  are  very  challenging  in  terms  of  providing  a
framework.  We  in  Gauteng  are  looking  very  carefully   at   developing
complementary legislation which will enable us  to  take  into  account  the
specific challenges of environmental responsibility in Gauteng.

The particular area of concern to all of us is how we can begin to  use  the
new legislative  framework  to  ensure  that  we  achieve  in  practice  the
national commitments that we have  to  sustainable  development.  There  are
some very exciting new legal frameworks; in particular, the IDP  process  at
local government level and the way the the EIA is increasingly been used  as
a tool to ensure that new developments  are  always  taken  forward  with  a
proper understanding of not only the economic  advantages  of  a  particular
development, but also the social, cultural and environmental consequences.

I think that the work that the  hon  the  Minister  is  doing  in  terms  of
promoting tourism that is nature-based and tourism that  does  benefit  from
the huge  biodiversity  and  natural  beauty  of  this  country  is  a  very
important contribution to making sure that  all  citizens  of  this  country
begin to have a sense that the country does indeed belong to  all  who  live
in it and that this vast array of biodiversity in terms of plant and  animal
life is a resource that must belong to and  benefit  all  of  us,  and  that
tourism is one way of ensuring that it does benefit all of us,  as  well  as
making sure that the environmental costs of  tourism,  as  Rev  Moatshe  has
spoken about, are carefully managed so that we as  a  country  benefit  from
those people who do come here to visit. [Time Expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs A  M  VERSFELD:  Chairperson,  in  accordance  with  the  Marine  Living
Resources Act, Act 18 of 1995, marine and coastal management  requires  that
all fishing industry permit holders comply with the department's  policy  on
vessel  monitoring  systems.  The  policy  prudently  stipulates  that   all
licensed fishing vessels are equipped with a monitoring and  control  device
linked to the global positioning system, or GPS, in this case Inmarsat C.

The present service provider is a British-French  company  that  appears  to
hold the sole mandate of the Minister's department to provide  this  service
to the fishing industry. Of course, the DP supports the  fact  that  vessels
should be equipped with a VMS, but not to the apparent  exclusion  of  other
potential contenders in this field.

In 'n dokument van die  departement  genaamd:  ``Information  regarding  the
VMS'', word daar melding gemaak dat -


  VMS will become a prerequisite within four months of the date of issue of
  the permit for a number of other fishing  sectors.  Stakeholder  meetings
  will be held with the relevant industry bodies.

Die  huidige  klassifikasie  en  wet  is  omskryf  ten  opsigte   van   twee
tegnologiese platforms, naamlik Inmarsat C en GSM.

Dit help nie om met die visbedryf te  gesels  oor  die  aangeleentheid  nie.
Gesprek moet  eerder  gevoer  word  met  verskaffers  wat  oor  alternatiewe
tegnologie  beskik.   Sodoende   kan   hierdie   verskaffers   deelneem   om
funksionaliteit en 'n koste-effektiewe alternatief daar te stel.

'n Maatskappy met die  naam  van  Startrack  het  byvoorbeeld  'n  nisproduk
tussen  Inmarsat  C  en  GSM  s'n.  Indien  'n  verskaffer  by  Inmarsat   C
geakkrediteer is, behoort die Regering Thales, wat die  eienaar-ontwikkelaar
van die programmatuur - Bluefinger se mariene afdeling  hanteer dit  op  die
oomblik - verplig om 'n ``poort oop te maak'' vir satellietdata van  hierdie
verskaffers. Hulle hoef nie konfidensialiteit  in  te  boet  nie.  'n  Blote
intervlakspesifikasie en 'n gepaardgaande ``no  disclosure''-ooreenkoms  kan
konfidensialiteit waarborg.

Tot nou toe was hulle nie bereid om dit te doen nie, en daar bestaan dus  'n
monopolie. Monopolieë van enige aard is ongesond en druis ook  in  teen  die
Wet op Mededinging, want hier geld nie net  suiwer  kommersiële  belang  vir
die verskaffer nie,  maar  direkte  ``waarde  vir  geld''  vir  die  bedryf.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In a document by  the  department  entitled:  ``Information  regarding  the
VMS'', it is mentioned that -


  VMS will become a prerequisite within four months of the date of issue of
  the permit for a number of other fishing  sectors.  Stakeholder  meetings
  will be held with the relevant industry bodies.

The  current  classification  and  Act  are  defined  with  regard  to   two
technological platforms, namely Inmarsat C and GSM.

It  does  not  help  to  discuss  the  matter  with  the  fishing  industry.
Discussions should rather  be  held  with  providers  who  have  alternative
technology. In this way these  providers  can  participate  in  establishing
functionality and a cost-effective alternative.

A company named Startrack, for example, has a niche  product  between  those
of Inmarsat C and GSM. If a provider is  accredited  with  Inmarsat  C,  the
Government  should  compel  Thales,  which  currently  handles  the   owner-
developer  of  the  software,  Bluefinger's  marine  section,  to  ``open  a
gateway'' for satellite data from these  providers.  They  do  not  have  to
forfeit confidentiality. A mere interface specification and an  accompanying
``no disclosure'' agreement can guarantee confidentiality.

Until now they have not been prepared  to  do  this,  and  a  monopoly  thus
exists. Monopolies of any nature are unhealthy and also fly in the  face  of
the Competition Act, because at issue here is  not  simply  pure  commercial
interest  for  the  provider,  but  direct  ``value  for  money''  for   the
industry.]

To mention, again, this supplier, Startrack, they estimate a saving  to  the
industry in the order of 45% in relation to the current service.  This  very
same company will, in two weeks' time, release an RV proximity tag.

Dit is 'n kaart soos ons kaarte waarmee ons in die  Parlement  kom,  wat  om
die nek hang.  Die  oomblik  as  daar  'n  dekman  oorboord  val,  gaan  dit
onmiddellik 'n sein uitstuur. [This is a tag like the  tags  with  which  we
enter Parliament, which hang around one's neck.  As  soon  as  a  deck  hand
falls overboard, it is going to send out a signal immediately.]

I am not canvassing for a specific company or a replacement of  the  current
system, but merely for an enhancement of the system, as it  is  of  cardinal
importance  to  an  industry  that  has  to  operate  to  increasingly  high
standards of safety.

Ek het geluister toe die Minister oor die Europese Unie gepraat het,  en  ek
is baie dankbaar om te verneem dat ons Regering staan by die  standpunt  dat
ons nie die Europese vlote in ons waters sal toelaat nie. Ek  het  egter  'n
Republikein - dit is 'n Namibiese koerant - van 24 Mei 2002 in my besit.  Ek
haal graag hieruit die volgende aan:


  Hoop het gister op Swakopmund opgevlam dat Suid-Afrika Namibië gaan  help
  om die sterwende pelsernywerheid te red. ``Ons sal 'n oplossing bereik,''
  het die Suid-Afrikaanse Minister van Omgewingsake en  Toerisme,  Minister
  Mohammed Moosa, gesê. Waar hy  voor  die  konferensiesaal  van  die  Alte
  Brücke met Republikein gesels het, het  ander  stemme  ook  opgegaan  wat
  daarop  dui  dat  Namibië  selfs  in  die  rol  van  'n  redder  tot  die
  sardynnywerheid van Suid-Afrika kan toetree.

Ek merk ook, en ek is baie dankbaar, dat die Minister die  totale  pelagiese
kwota verhoog het met 158%. Dit ís te danke aan die goeie  bestuur  van  die
bronne, maar terselfdertyd moet die Minister ook  nie  die  opofferings  wat
daarmee  gepaard  gegaan  het  uit  die  oog  verloor  nie.  Baie  pelagiese
vissermanne het selfs hul huise  verloor  in  hul  poging  om  die  bron  te
beskerm. Ek dink werklik  dit  sal  baie  onregverdig  wees  om  in  hierdie
stadium dié mense daardie bron te ontneem.

Op die oomblik is die pelagiese appèlle nog nie eers gehanteer nie. Daar  is
baie mense wat geïnvesteer het in die bedryf, maar  wat  hul  regte  verloor
het. Baie kwotas is nie eers  ekonomies  lewensvatbaar  nie.  Ek  wil  graag
vandag van die Minister weet: waar staan Suid-Afrika  ten  opsigte  van  die
pelagiese bedryf van Namibië? Ek dink hy skuld hierdie Raad 'n antwoord.

Sy departement het die hofsaak teen die Elandsbaaise  fabrieke,  wat  gegaan
het oor die hersiening van die toekenningsproses,  met  koste  verloor.  Die
ligte is rooi. Die gevaarligte brand.

Ek hoor die Minister praat ligtelik van ``fair and equitable''. Sou  hy  dit
as ``fair and equitable'' beskryf dat  hy  'n  ad  hoc-toekenning  maak  ten
opsigte van sommige Weskus-appèlle?  Sewe  tot  nege  van  dié  appèlle  wat
suksesvol was, het op 3 April verskyn. 'n Maand later, op  3  Mei,  het  die
res van die appèlle te voorskyn gekom. So onlangs soos gisteraand  was  daar
nóg mense wie se appèlle uitstaande was, en waaroor daar nog  nie  sekerheid
was nie.

Die regsamptenaar in sy departement het van  die  maatskappye  gebel  om  te
hoor of hulle besig was met regsaksies, en aan hul gesê dat  hul  eers  moet
wag sodat  die  departement  kan  kyk  wat  hy  kan  doen.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I listened when the Minister spoke about the European Union, and I am  very
grateful to learn that our Government is standing by the  position  that  we
will not allow the  European  fleets  in  our  waters.  However,  I  have  a
Republikein - that  is  a  Namibian  newspaper  -  of  24  May  2002  in  my
possession. I would like to quote the following from it:


  Hoop het gister op Swakopmund opgevlam dat Suid-Afrika Namibië gaan  help
  om die sterwende pelsernywerheid te red. ``Ons sal 'n oplossing bereik,''
  het die Suid-Afrikaanse Minister van Omgewingsake en  Toerisme,  Minister
  Mohammed Moosa, gesê. Waar hy  voor  die  konferensiesaal  van  die  Alte
  Brücke met Republikein gesels het, het  ander  stemme  ook  opgegaan  wat
  daarop  dui  dat  Namibië  selfs  in  die  rol  van  'n  redder  tot  die
  sardynnywerheid van Suid-Afrika kan toetree.

I also note, and I am very grateful, that the  Minister  has  increased  the
total pelagic quota by 158%. This  is  thanks  to  good  management  of  the
resources, but at the same time the Minister should also not lose  sight  of
the sacrifices that were associated with this. Many pelagic  fishermen  even
lost their homes in their attempt to protect the resource.  I  really  think
it would be very unfair to deny these people that resource at this stage.

At the moment the pelagic appeals have not even been dealt with  yet.  There
are many people who invested in the industry, but lost  their  rights.  Many
quotas are not even economically viable. Today I would  like  to  know  from
the Minister: Where does South Africa  stand  with  regard  to  the  pelagic
industry of Namibia? I think he owes this Council an answer.
His department lost the court case against the Elands Bay  factories,  which
was about the review of the allocation process, with costs. The  lights  are
red. The warning lights are on.

I hear the Minister speaks lightly about ``fair and  equitable''.  Would  he
describe it as fair and equitable that he make an  ad  hoc  allocation  with
regard to some West Coast appeals? Seven to  nine  of  these  appeals  which
were successful appeared on 3 April. A month later, on 3 May,  the  rest  of
the appeals appeared. As recently as last  night  there  were  still  people
whose  appeals  were  outstanding,  and  about  whom  there  was  still  not
certainty.

The legal officer in his department telephoned  some  of  the  companies  to
hear whether they were involved in legal action, and  told  them  that  they
should wait so that the department could see what it could do.]

That is not due process. That is not fair. That is not equitable.

In die stokvisbedryf is daar  ook  geweldige  ongelukkigheid.  Hoe  kan  die
Minister aanvaar dat 'n maatskappy soos Viking, wat kwotas  van  3  064  ton
``hake trawl'' en 1 188 ton ``hake  inshore''  het,  en  ...  [In  the  hake
industry there is also a great deal of unhappiness.  How  can  the  Minister
accept that a company like Viking, which has quotas of 3 064  tons  of  hake
trawl and 1 188 tons of hake inshore ...]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, on a point of order: Are  we  discussing  the
fish and sea here or other issues?

Mrs A M VERSFELD: I said I am not taking any questions. Chairperson,  may  I
please go on.

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: I am not talking to you. Wait till you ...

Mrs A M VERSFELD: I said I am not going to take any questions.  So,  I  hope
you will grant me the extra time.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! But hon member, I have not  asked  you
a question. I will protect you, but do not intimidate me. You may  continue,
hon member.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, will you please protect me from the  lady  in
front of me. [Applause.]

Die stokvisbedryf veroorsaak net soveel ongelukkigheid. As ek  kan  terugkom
na Viking, wat soveel ``inshore'' en soveel ``trawl'' tonnemaat  gekry  het,
dan het sy party die vermetelheid ... [Tussenwerpsels.] [The  hake  industry
is causing just as much unhappiness. If I could come back to  Viking,  which
received so much inshore and so much trawl tonnage, then his party  has  the
audacity ... [Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, there is another point  of
order. Your time will not be taken by the points of order.

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, on a point of order: I just want  to  know  from
the hon member whether she is addressing the House or the gallery?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon member has  indicated  earlier
on that she will not answer any questions. Carry on, hon member.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Thank you, Chairperson. And then that department  has  the
audacity to allocate ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member Versfeld, there is  another
point of order.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, I want you to protect me please.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I promise to protect you, hence  I  am
saying your time will not be taken by these points of order. You  will  have
your time.

Chief M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it in order for  the
hon member to refer to another hon member as ``this lady in front of me?''

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Saying ``this lady in front  of  me,''
is a not a way of addressing one another. Hon  member  Versfeld,  would  you
continue.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Thank you, Chairperson. And then that department  has  the
audacity to allocate 65 tons of hake longline.

Dit is 'n afdeling wat daar is vir  die  minderbevoorregte  mense,  vir  die
klein groepe, en dit word sowaar aan Viking Fishing, wat al die  ander  het,
gegee! [That is a classification which is  there  for  the  underprivileged,
for the small groups, and it was actually given  to  Viking  Fishing,  which
has all the others!]

... as if they need that. And then he calls it fair and equitable. It  might
be legally justifiable, but it is not  morally  justifiable  and  we  cannot
call it fair and equitable.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time is up.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: It is impossible, Chairperson. I  have  eight  minutes.  I
have not spoken .... [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time is up. Your  not
believing it is casting aspersions on the staff  in  front  of  me  who  are
monitoring the minutes even in the same  manner  as  I  had  said  that  the
points of order will not take any of your allocated time. [Interjections.]

Mr J I MABENA (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, Minister Valli  Moosa,  colleagues,
MECs, members of NCOP for the opportunity to participate in  the  debate  on
the economic sector that I believe has a great potential, not only  to  help
us deal with the scourge of unemployment, but also in the  consolidation  of
the foundation that we have laid in building  reconciliation  and  a  united
society.

The promotion of domestic tourism is  key  in  achieving  this.  Tourism  is
about human relations and trust. Every tourist who visits a destination  and
does not stay with his or her friends or relatives, but in an  accommodation
facility - be it a guesthouse or hotel - places his or her entire  life  and
trust in the  hands  of  strangers  in  the  form  of  hotel  or  guesthouse
managers, waiters, chefs, housekeepers, bar  attendants,  etc.  It  is  said
that  a  smile  is  a  very  important  tool  in   the   tourism   industry.
[Interjections.] That is why I would like to submit that the creation  of  a
less adversarial labour relations environment in this sector is one  of  the
important prerequisites, and we can do that in partnership.

This is  one  sector  that  needs  the  creation  of  a  fulfilling  working
environment. I am not saying  that  we  should  take  over  from  the  trade
unions, but I am saying that both employers and  labour  movements  in  this
sector will have to ensure that  we  always  have  this  fulfilling  working
environment.

This is also an industry some of whose activities are  based  on  hope  when
tourists who are game lovers wake up very early at dawn, climb into  a  game
drive vehicle at Kruger National Park, drive around on a  guided  tour  full
of hope of seeing some if not all the members of  the  big  five.  The  same
element of hope can be found among bird lovers.

In March 2002, our province hosted the first African Peace  Through  Tourism
Conference. At the end of the conference, we all agreed that we could  bring
peace using tourism as a catalyst. The potential of the tourism industry  to
create jobs cannot be overemphasised as it is labour intensive, unlike  some
of the sectors such as automobile manufacturing, where the robot  revolution
is rife, with six-metre tall robots used to screw in nuts and bolts.

In the tourism industry, for now, we still need warm bodies, ie  people,  to
do most of the jobs. There is no way in  which  one  can  say  to  a  robot:
``Take this food  to  room  203''.  So,  I  am  saying  that  it  is  labour
intensive. Tourism has the multiplier effect as its success depends  on  the
efficiency and effectiveness of many  of  its  components.  Through  tourism
other opportunities, especially in services, are created.

The challenge that we are currently facing as a country  is  to  make  South
Africa ``the'' tourism destination. We have a world in one country  and  all
that we need to do is to enhance our comparative advantage  and  competitive
edge as a country.

This is a point which Minister Valli Moosa emphasised in his  budget  speech
in May 2002, when he said that:


  In order to realise high levels of growth in tourism, we need to increase
  the number  of  tourists  to  South  Africa;  we  need  to  decrease  the
  seasonality patterns and we need to make more conscious efforts to ensure
  that tourism growth creates opportunities for empowerment.

In the spirit of responsible tourism development we must  of  course,  while
increasing the number of tourists to our country, ensure  that  we  increase
our carrying capacity in the form of infrastructure development,  and  there
are a number of positive steps  that  have  been  taken,  also  through  the
poverty alleviation programme. The need to diversify  our  tourism  products
on an ongoing basis presents us with an incredible opportunity to deal  with
both the problem of seasonality patterns and meeting our empowerment  policy
interests.

The  fact  that  193  emerging  entrepreneurs,  which   includes   21   from
Mpumalanga, were part of this year's Tourism Indaba in May 2002  in  Durban,
is a clear indication that we are indeed on track  with  the  transformation
of the industry. The fragility of the tourism industry and the fact that  it
is easily affected by any level of insecurity cannot be  overemphasised.  We
are all aware of the negative impact that  the  incidents  of  11  September
2001  had  on  tourism.  So,  the  question  of  tourism  safety  needs  all
stakeholders to put their shoulders to the wheel. This is more important  as
our country is seen and perceived as a safe destination.

It is incumbent  upon  all  of  us  to  ensure  that  co-ordination  systems
continue to be strengthened and that our marketing strategy  and  drive  are
intensified. The massive contribution of domestic tourism must be enhanced.

In conclusion, the challenges facing us as Government include,  inter  alia,
the following: ensuring  that  tourism  is  Government-led,  private  sector
driven and community-based at all levels, but more so at  the  local  level.
We must ensure and support the development  of  synergies  and  partnerships
among various stakeholders  at  all  levels,  and  there  must  be  a  clear
programme focused at building the  capacity  of  emerging  entrepreneurs  to
engage meaningfully in all processes.

As I have said, we must always ensure  that  there  is  a  less  adversarial
labour relations environment in this sector in partnership with  labour  and
the private sector. We must ensure that the 193 emerging  entrepreneurs  who
were taken to the Tourism Indaba 2002 to market their products  or  projects
are sustained and  that  they  can  attend  the  2003  Tourism  Indaba  with
enhanced products. We must deal with the problem of terrible  air  pollution
caused by some of the major industries such as the ones in  pulp  and  paper
and petrochemicals manufacturing.

It is not enough for us to hear the pulp and paper industry saying that  for
the bleaching process they have moved  from  chloride  to  ozone  as  though
ozone is the only available technology to ensure that there is reduction  in
terms of air pollution whilst there are other  systems  that  can  be  used.
This terrible air pollution has a negative impact on tourism.

We must strengthen the unique transfrontier park initiatives  as  it  is  in
line with the regional  economic  integration  policy  of  this  government,
because as it is now, it will very soon be  easy  for  a  tourist  to  enter
Skukuza, go to the Northern Province, take a cruise on Massingir Dam in  the
Gaza province of Mozambique and end up on the beautiful beaches of  Xai-Xai.
Those are the  benefits  of  these  transfrontier  parks  in  terms  of  the
diversification of our products.  We  must  commend  the  Minister  and  his
Department for the hard work they have done within such a  brief  period  of
time to turn the industry around.

One believes that a  strong  foundation  has  been  laid,  and  we  can,  in
partnership with all stakeholders, grow this industry even bigger.

Nkk  J  N  VILAKAZI:  Sihlalo   ohloniphekileyo,   mhlonishwa   uNgqongqoshe
womNyango,  neNdlu  yonke  ehloniphekileyo,  mangiqale  ngokubonga   kakhulu
kumhlonishwa  kanye  nomNyango  wakhe   ngokuxazulula   inkinga   ebisikhona
kubangcebeleki emabhishi, mayelana nezimoto ezidume ngokubizwa ngo-4X4.

Ebhishi edume kakhulu, iSt  Lucia,  okuyindawo  edume  umhlaba  wonke  futhi
okungenye yezinye ezaziwa  ngokuthi  ama-World  Heritage  Sites,  okungamafa

usebadedele manje, KwaZulu-Natali, ukuthi o-4X4 mabaqhubeke ngoba  bangenisa
imali.

Angikhulumeli  nokho  iSt  Lucia  yodwa,  angizishiyi  ngaphandle   izindawo
esicebe ngazo ekuheheni izivakashi KwaZulu ezifana  noKosi  Bay  kanye  nalo
lonke  ugu  lolwandle  esinalo.  Sicebile  KwaZulu-Natali  ngalezi  zindawo.
Kukhona izindawo ezidinga imali eningi ukuze zithuthuke kakhulu.  Sineziqiwi
ezifana noMfolozi Game Reserve, Hluhluwe Game Reserve,  Ndumo  Game  Reserve
kanye nezinye izindawo eziheha izivakashi. Sine-Valley of a Thousand  Hills,
namahlathi adumile oNkandla Forest  Reserve  noDukuduku  forest  -  sicebile
KwaZulu Natali.  Ngithi  kuNgqongqoshe  sidinga  imali  eningi.  Sinezindawo
ezinamanzi  ashisayo  konke  okuyizinto  ezinhle  futhi  ezithandwa  kakhulu
izivakashi.

IKwaZulu-Natali  ayinabusika,  kuhlale  kufudumele  khona  ubusika  nehlobo.
Amakhaza  ayivela  kancane  e-KZN.  Amasimu  kamoba   ayaziheha   izivakashi

Natali icebile nje kuzo zonke izinto. Noma kunjalo-ke kodwa asilingani.

Abantu, KwaZulu, bayazenzela ngezandla zabo imisebenzi  emihle  nekhangisayo

Badinga ukusizwa ukuze izivakashi zisizakale.

Okokugcina, izivakashi siyazithokozisa  ngomculo  onhlobonhlobo.  Omasikandi

Cha, nina benkosi  bengithi  nje  angithi  qaphu  qaphu  kafushane,  ngigiya
ngombuso wethu KwaZulu. Uma siheha izivakashi siye sithi: ``Welcome  to  the
Kingdom of the Zulus.'' Kodwa-ke  sibuye  sijike  futhi  uma  sithanda  bese

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister for  the  Department,  and  the
House at large, I would first of all like to  thank  the  hon  Minister  for
resolving the problem that has been encountered by  tourists  at  the  beach
regarding 4x4 motor vehicles.

At St Lucia, which is a popular place worldwide and one of the places  which
are known as a World Heritage Site - a world natural inheritance -  tourists
were  unable  to  drive  these  cars  that  move  easily  on  the  seashore.
Passengers enjoyed driving these  cars  at  the  seaside,  appreciating  the
beauty of nature. The economy  has  been  declining  as  a  result  of  this
situation. We thank the hon Minister  for  allowing  the  4x4s  to  continue
because they are a source of income in KwaZulu-Natal.

I am not talking about St Lucia only. I am  not  leaving  out  some  of  our
heritage sites that we have as tourist attractions such as Kosi Bay and  the
rest of our seashore. We are rich with these places in KwaZulu-Natal.  There
are places that need a lot of money to develop to their full  potential.  We
have game reserves such as  the  Mfolozi  Game  Reserve,  the  Nondumo  Game
Reserve, and other places that attract tourists, such as  the  Valley  of  a
Thousands Hills,  and  forests  such  as  the  Nkandla  Forest  Reserve  and
Dukuduku Forest -  we  are  rich  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  I  am  saying  to  the
Minister, we need more money. We have hot springs, which form  part  of  all
the beautiful things that are loved more than anyone by tourists.

There is no winter in KwaZulu-Natal; it is warm in  winter  as  well  as  in
summer. It  is  hardly  cold  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  Sugarcane  fields  attract
tourists. Mr Nyakane and Mrs B Dlulane, who are with us in this  House,  are
witnesses of this. We have dams such as the  Ntshongweni  Dam,  Midmar  Dam,
Pongola Dam and Goedertrouw Dam. The list is endless. KwaZulu-Natal is  rich
everything. Nevertheless, we are not equal.

People in KwaZulu-Natal make beautiful things with their own  hands,  things
that are attractive to tourists. We  are  asking  for  more  funds  in  this
province, which brings money to the whole of South Africa. I am  asking  the
Minister to give more funds to those people who have skills, but are  unable
to use them because they lack funds. We have many different sorts of  things
in KwaZulu-Natal.

We entertain our visitors. We call upon members to come  and  see.  We  also
have different kinds of traditional dance. There are  famous  beauty  queens
in this province. Tourists are coming in numbers to see for themselves.

No, you subjects of the king, I was just briefly  informing  you  about  our
kingdom, KwaZulu. When  we  attract  tourists,  we  say:  ``Welcome  to  the
Kingdom of the Zulus!'' We also change this and say: KwaZulu-Natal.]

This is all within the parameters of freedom of speech. I can tell  the  hon
the Minister that the IFP supports the Budget Vote.

Siyababongela labo abaphumelele  emncintiswaneni  omuhle  kangaka  wedolobha
elihlanzekile. Sithi kodwa: Zisina  zidedelana.  Kusasa  kuzoba  kungabanye.
[Ihlombe.] [We congratulate those who won such a remarkable  competition  as
the one of the clean  city.  But  we  say:  Tomorrow,  it  will  be  others.
[Applause.]]

Mr T S SETONA:  Chairperson,  I  am  speaking  on  behalf  of  the  MEC  for
environmental affairs and tourism in the province, the hon T  S  Belot,  who
is not here with us today as he has lost his younger brother on  Tuesday  on
the occasion of the debate on the Budget Vote of  the  Department  of  Trade
and Industry. So, every ``I'' in the speech will  refer  to  Mr  Belot,  not
myself! [Laughter.]

Chairperson and hon  members,  one  of  the  main  responsibilities  of  any
government in the world is that of  ensuring  a  better  life  for  all  its
citizens. This responsibility remains one of the greatest challenges  facing
this Government in terms of the eradication  of  poverty,  which  affects  a
number of its citizens. Poverty has been identified as one  of  the  factors
that contribute towards irreversible degradation  of  natural  resources  in
the whole world. It is one of those factors which form the components  of  a
vicious cycle between people and the natural environment.

It was this realisation that led the nations of the world  to  gather  in  a
summit  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1992  to  discuss  issues  of  sustainable
development. Ten years down the line, and in two months' time, this  country
will be  hosting  a  follow-up  summit  on  the  issues  of  environmentally
sustainable social and economic development  of  the  poor.  It  will  be  a
summit on the welfare of the various nations of the world.

It gives me great pleasure to inform members that, at provincial  level,  my
department is actively involved in activities that are  aimed  at  preparing
for  this  upcoming  summit.  On  17  and  18  May  2002  the  province,  in
conjunction with Jowsco, which is the  Johannesburg  World  Summit  Company,
hosted the roadshow for the summit. It  was  a  successful  event  that  was
attended by a wide range of stakeholders from within the  province.  One  of
the  products  of  the  Free  State  roadshow  was  a  declaration  by   all
stakeholders present  which,  in  a  nutshell,  recognised  co-operation  in
government and working in partnership with other sectors and partners  as  a
key to sustainable development.

The  declaration  further  identified  the  World  Summit   on   Sustainable
Development as an opportunity to join the nations of the world in  declaring
our  unwavering  commitment  to  the  eradication  of  poverty  and   taking
practical steps in attaining sustainable development.

It gives me pleasure to further inform members that  we  in  the  department
have started preparing for yet another world summit that will be  hosted  by
our country next year. This is the World Parks Conference  that  also  meets
every ten years as a major global forum for protected  areas.  It  offers  a
unique opportunity to take stock of  protected  areas,  provides  an  honest
appraisal of progress and setbacks, and  charts  the  course  for  protected
areas for the next decade and beyond.

In simple words, the challenge for this world body is  to  ensure  that  the
future  generations  will  be  able  to  enjoy  the  wildlife  and   natural
biodiversity that we have today. While  the  South  African  National  Parks
Board  is  the  lead  organisation  working  within  the   IUCN   on   these
preparations, officials from my department  are  participating  at  steering
committee level to help drive the planning process.

The theme  of  the  congress  is  ``Benefits  Beyond  Boundaries'',  and  is
intended to stimulate broader thinking about protected areas. This theme  is
intended to develop strategic alliances between protected  areas  and  other
sectors such as tourism, forestry, water supply, etc. This will  be  another
invaluable opportunity for our  communities  to  witness  the  relevance  of
protected areas to the broader economic, social  and  environmental  agendas
of the world in the 21st century.

Great strides have been  made  in  the  area  of  waste  management  in  the
province. With  the  launch  of  the  Cleanest  Town  Competition  on  World
Environment Day by Minister Valli Moosa at  Batho  in  Mangaung  last  year,
municipalities  have  taken  the  challenge  to  keep  their   towns   clean
seriously. In the Free State, 11 of  our  25  local  municipalities  entered
this competition. Entering the competition made the municipalities, and  the
communities  at  large,  aware  of  the  critical  issues  concerning  waste
management.

The competition instilled a sense of ownership in the community and a  great
improvement has been realised in the cleanliness of towns.  I  believe  that
this Cleanest Town Competition will yield good results if  it  is  continued
on an ongoing basis. I also believe this will ease the waste  and  pollution
problem in our towns. We will achieve the goal of having clean  and  healthy
towns in this country.

Subsequent to the waste summit that was held  in  the  Limpopo  province  in
September last year, the Free State is holding  awareness-raising  workshops
with various stakeholders on the Polokwane Declaration. This  has  been  the
main focus of the World Environment Week activities within the province.

A waste management committee will be established in  each  district  council
to identify and resolve waste management problems in an integrated  fashion.
These committees  will  be  constituted  of  representatives  of  government
departments  that  manage  activities  which  impact  on  the   environment,
industries and civil society.

Waste minimisation, with intense focus on prevention, reduction,  reuse  and
recycling of waste, is being emphasised through enviro-clubs established  in
schools throughout the province. General education is given  to  the  public
to raise awareness of the jobs that can  be  created  from  recycling  waste
into artefacts  that  can  be  marketed  both  locally  and  overseas,  thus
promoting investment and tourism in the country.

Buy-back centres are being established in  poor  communities  to  remunerate
individuals  that  collect  and  sort  waste  for  recycling.  There  is   a
willingness amongst communities to  actively  participate  in  the  project.
However, the transport for collection of the waste is often a challenge  for
the community and, thus, the success of these buy-back centres.

The municipality is currently providing labelled bins at taxi  ranks  as  an
initiative to encourage the separation of waste from source  for  recycling.
There is, however, still a need to educate the  community  about  discarding
the different waste streams in the designated bins,  as  some  people  still
mix up the waste in the labelled bins.

A waste information system pilot project will be launched  at  the  Mangaung
municipality before the  end  of  2002  for  the  storing  of  data  on  air
pollution emissions and waste disposal by industry.  This  information  will
be accessible to the public, and polluting  industries  will  be  shamed  in
public  for  degradation  of   the   environment.   Industries   and   other
stakeholders will thus be forced  to  reduce  air  pollution  and  hazardous
waste disposal in order  to  enjoy  support  from  the  Government  and  the
public.

Currently, the prevention of air pollution is  unfortunately  not  effective
due  to  the  inadequacy  of  air  pollution  officers  in  the   provincial
department of environmental  affairs  and  tourism,  as  well  as  at  local
government level. This will, however,  change  with  the  enactment  of  the
national air quality Bill, which should take place before the end  of  2003.
In terms of this Bill, each environmental  affairs  and  tourism  provincial
office will be expected to appoint an air pollution  control  officer.  Each
industry with significant emission levels will have to start monitoring  and
taking mitigation measures to control its emissions.

Reports to this effect  will  be  submitted  to  the  local  authority  and,
ultimately, to the department for national  publication  through  the  waste
information system. Industries not  conforming  to  the  ambient  standards,
according to the proposed national air quality Act, will be prosecuted.

Subsistence fishing is being protected by the River Health Programme.  So  I
think it is not only the Western Cape that can talk about fishing. It  is  a
pity the hon Versfeld is not here. This  programme  involves  the  different
species occurring in a river. The presence or absence of a  certain  species
determines the health of the river as well as the  extent  of  pollution  in
the water.

The removal of the water hyacinths and azola at  Bloemhof  Dam  and  at  the
Vaal and Vet Rivers is being prioritised, as their fronds cover the  surface
of the water, preventing oxygen penetration and ultimately resulting in  the
death of fish in the river. Two yellow fish species have been identified  as
indicator species for the rivers in the Free  State.  Anglers  will  pay  to
catch these fish and this will generate revenue  and  employment  for  rural
people, who will conserve the fish and their habitat.

In closing, I  am  also  pleased  to  inform  members  that  with  financial
assistance  from  the  national  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism, the province will  soon  be  compiling  a  state-of-the-environment
report for the entire province. Various stakeholders will be engaged  during
this process, which includes other government  departments,  nongovernmental
organisations,  the  private  sector,  education  institutions   and   civil
society.

The state-of-the-environment report will  provide  access  to  environmental
information  that  will  be  integrated,  analysed   and   interpreted   for
governmental and other agencies to enhance decision-making  and  sustainable
development  planning.  The  report  will  be  a  tool  for   enhancing   an
understanding  of  environmental  issues,  rights  and  responsible  actions
which, in turn, will encourage individuals,  communities  and  organisations
to improve their quality of life.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the national  department  for
organising sponsorship for funding this very important process on behalf  of
the province. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, Minister, I am going to raise  a  question  with
the Minister that I raised with him last year and, I  am  afraid,  on  which
there has not been any progress.

The question has to do  with  the  West  Coast  National  Parks  Board  land
acquisition programme. This has to  do  with  the  land  that  lies  in  the
northern core of the West Coast biosphere reserve which is listed under  the
Unesco biodiversity protocol. The land is called Langfontein. It is a  farm,
it is attractive land and  it  is  currently  owned  by  the  Department  of
Defence. It is the only bit of Renosterveld left  in  that  area  contiguous
with  the  National  Parks  Board,  which  is  superfluous  to  the  Defence
department's needs and where the ownership of the land  is  currently  under
review. The West Coast National Parks Board applied for the  land  some  two
years ago. There are other competing interests now. The land is  central  to
the long-term expansion plans of the National Parks Board and  will  protect
the northern part of the West Coast biosphere.

The land can be transferred at no cost because it is  Government  land.  The
Minister knows that only about 1% of West Coast fynbos  is  left.  The  rest
has gone to the plough or to alien vegetation or to development. There is  a
little area around the West Coast National Park  which  is  left,  the  core
area of that biosphere. This Defence Force land is  absolutely  critical.  I
understand now that it has very low agricultural potential,  but  very  high
biodiversity and that is why it is listed under the Unesco protocol.

The land provides an opportunity to increase  the  botanical  diversity,  to
reintroduce rare animals and species, and it  adjoins  Elandsfontein,  which
is home to the  the  second  oldest  human  remains  in  the  country  after
Sterkfontein. It has a high tourism potential  and  therefore  will  support
employment.

They want to increase the critical mass of this land on the eastern side  of
the park. This land is absolutely central. It is the  only  important  piece
of land which is key to one or two other pieces of  land,  and  when  it  is
gone - there will be nothing left. The difficulty is that we  are  now  here
at this point.

First of all, we have heard nothing for years. They  have  been  applying  -
they have applied twice. They keep hearing  stories,  but  get  no  response
from anybody. Now we hear that Correctional Services  has  applied  for  the
land as well and that they want to build a prison. I know  it  is  important
to have prisons and I am sure  the  motives  of  Correctional  Services  are
good. But to build  a  high-security  prison  in  the  middle  of  the  most
biodiverse part of the Western Cape, inside what could be  a  national  park
adjoining a national park, on  the  last  remaining  piece  of  Renosterveld
would be vandalism, and I know  that  the  Minister's  department  will  not
allow it.

That is why I have the temerity to raise the matter with him.  I  know  that
the Minister will give it his attention, and it needs his urgent  attention.
It really does. It is a critical piece of land - a supersensitive  piece  of
land - which is enormously biodiverse.

The National Parks Board has applied, they qualify in all respects and  they
are supported by everybody,  including  all  the  conservation  authorities.
Their argument is that the land has no agricultural value. They really  need
to resolve this matter. I am asking the  Minister  to  please  give  it  his
attention.

We look forward to the Protected Areas Bill, which I know  the  Minister  is
working on. We look forward to it in this Parliament. This will give  us  in
the Western Cape the opportunity to give status to  the  biosphere  reserves
ourselves. It will allow us to give them teeth.  Currently,  they  are  good
planning tools but they have no legal force. We are working in  the  Western
Cape on legislation to  give  these  biospheres  status.  This  will  be  in
harmony with the legislation which the Minister  is  currently  planning,  I
understand,  on  the  Protected  Areas  Bill,  the  Bill  that  I  mentioned
previously.

I want to tell the Minister that this piece of land is  the  only  piece  of
land there. It has the sea on the one side, a city  on  the  other,  another
city on the other side. It is agricultural  land  that  has  been  used  for
monoculture. Inside that biosphere people  are  planting  pine  forests  and
applying for eucalyptus forests, and ripping out the last of the fynbos  for
planting potatoes. There is hardly anything left.

And here one has this unique piece of land that just by luck belongs to  the
Department of Defence.  I  ask  the  Minister  to  please  respond  to  that
application from the National Parks Board and transfer  this  land  to  them
quickly, because it would be a  wonderful  thing  were  he  to  do  this,  a
wonderful thing for us in the Cape and a wonderful thing  for  our  country.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I note that Gauteng has walked out.  I
do not know whether it is in protest, but all the Gauteng seats are empty.

Mr J P GELDERBLOM (Western Cape): Madam Chair, first and foremost I want  to
thank the Minister of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism,  Mr  Valli  Moosa,
for the wonderful work he is doing at the  national  level  to  promote  the
case for tourism in the Western Cape and South Africa. I say thank you  very
much to the Minister.

It was with a great sense of pride that I attended the largest  travel  expo
in Africa some weeks ago - the Tourism Indaba in Durban.  Many  participants
there were from the  Western  Cape.  We  have  tried  to  gear  our  tourism
industry  towards  creating  sustainable,  self-reliant  and   developmental
opportunities  for  communities.  Ultimately,   a   prerequisite   for   the
successful development of tourism is the participation of the community.

It is our intention to ensure that tourism in the Western Cape  is  open  to
all. We are the gateway to Africa, and we have a responsibility to  showcase
African hospitality. Our efforts  to  promote  township  tourism  have  paid
handsome  dividends,  with  increased  numbers  of  visitors  visiting   the
formerly disadvantaged areas near Cape Town in particular.

This has added yet another destination to  the  itinerary  of  international
tourists who increasingly want to interact with local people and  taste  the
flavours of the countries that they visit. I am  pleased  to  announce  that
our policy of including businesses from formerly disadvantaged areas in  the
indaba this year and last year is also beginning to pay dividends.

The joint marketing initiative,  JMI,  in  the  Western  Cape  is  aimed  at
joining the fragmented marketing forces of the  Western  Cape  in  order  to
increase tourism, trade and investment to the Cape. It makes more  sense  to
streamline our marketing efforts  and  to  have  a  single-minded  focus  in
promoting Cape Town and the  Western  Cape  to  national  and  international
markets.

In the short term, the JMI aims to promote the Western Cape  and  Cape  Town
in  a  focused  and  united  marketing  strategy.  In  the  long  term,  the
initiative will bring economic upliftment, create jobs and benefit  all  the
citizens. The challenge is to ensure that the image of  Cape  Town  and  its
hinterland is translated into a single  brand,  which  shapes  domestic  and
foreign perceptions of our region as  a  desirable  place  in  which  to  do
business, invest and visit. The JMI will change the  face  of  Western  Cape
tourism.

Over the past 15 to 20 years,  the  market  incentive  for  the  hosting  of
meetings,  conferences  and  events  have  experienced  major  international
growth. However, the Western Cape has not  been  able  to  respond  to  this
opportunity, because we could  not  offer  facilities  of  an  international
standard.

This year  the  Western  Cape  provincial  government  allocated  a  capital
payment of R85 million for a world-standard convention centre.  At  present,
SunWest International contributes R140 million and the  City  of  Cape  Town
R264 million. The  centre,  rising  on  the  Foreshore  as  we  speak,  will
position the Western Cape as a destination for global meetings,  conventions
and events, and will be a major opportunity to grow into  tourism.  It  will
be an important magnet in attracting business tourists.

The Cape Town Convention Bureau recently  confirmed  that  just  under  R100
million worth of convention business has been secured between now and  2010.
The positive impact of this on the local fiscus  cannot  be  underestimated,
nor can the value of its job creation potential. Convenco  is  an  excellent
example of tourism  potential  to  fight  poverty.  The  centre  will  offer
opportunities to outsource and concession activities which are not  core  to
the  management  of  a  world  class  convention  centre.  It  will  provide
opportunities for  Western  Cape-based  businesses,  especially  those  from
previously  marginalised  communities,  to  operate  in   an   international
environment. It is estimated that, in  the  next  10  years,  Convenco  will
contribute R25 billion to the GDP, and in  this  time  will  create  47  000
direct and indirect job opportunities. I am pleased  to  announce  that  the
convention centre is due to open one month ahead of schedule in July 2003.

With regard to addressing the flight increases to Cape Town,  my  department
is critically aware of the urgent need to resolve the ``open  skies''  issue
and we engage with international carriers to pursue ways and means to  allow
greater inflow of international tourists into  the  country  via  Cape  Town
International Airport.

I would also like to  thank  the  Minister  for  his  contribution  in  this
regard. As hon members are aware, I also recently called for an  enquiry  in
the Western Cape to prove the frequency of both domestic  and  international
flights into Cape Town and their impact on tourism  in  the  province.  This
action follows widespread disenchantment among the tourism industry  in  the
Western Cape concerning the low  frequency  of  international  and  domestic
flights into the province and its detrimental  impact  on  tourism  for  the
area.

International and domestic flights into Cape Town are  of  vital  importance
for the Western Cape. Tourism in the Western Cape is big and over  the  past
few months it has become clearer to me that  the  tourism  budget  for  this
province is not in accordance with its huge job creation potential.  In  the
tourism industry there are many expectations and  great  pressure  from  our
private sector partners to develop this potential.  Without  an  appropriate
budget we cannot operate effectively and I intend looking into this in  more
detail and the Western Cape government supports me in this regard.

There is no doubt that tourism is  offering  us  the  best  opportunity  for
economic and employment growth over the next decade.  In  fighting  poverty,
tourism  development  must  play  a  critical   role   in   supporting   the
constitution's commitment to improving the quality of life of  all  citizens
while protecting the natural environment for future generations.

As far as environmental affairs and development planning is  concerned,  the
Western  Cape  economy,  and  in   particular   agricultural   tourism   and
manufacturing  sectors,   is   dependent   upon   the   sustainability   and
availability of natural resources such as clean air,  water  and  soil,  and
the fauna and flora, and on the scenic beauty of the province's natural  and
cultural landscapes and coastline.

The province of the Western Cape has the  privilege  and  responsibility  of
being home to the major part of the  smallest  of  the  world's  six  floral
kingdoms. Some 80%  of  the  Cape  floral  kingdom  is  located  within  the
boundaries of this one province. The  government  of  the  Western  Cape  is
fully committed  to  managing  this  unique  resource  sustainably  and  has
embraced a bio-regional approach to land use  planning  to  give  effect  to
this commitment. The Western Cape Chief Directorate plays a key role in  the
environmental decision-making process that leads to business promotion,  job
creation and poverty alleviation. The  inequality  in  the  distribution  of
wealth and resources and the  resultant  poverty  are  among  the  important
causes, as well as the results, of harmful practices.

The  core  business  of  this  directorate  is  not   the   protection   and
preservation of the biophysical  elements  of  the  environment.  It  is  to
administer, implement and enforce  the  regulatory  framework  that  ensures
that activities which are probed  because  they  may  have  a  substantially
detrimental effect on  the  environment  are  considered,  investigated  and
accessed prior  to  their  authorisation  and  implementation.  Indeed,  the
Western Cape has stirred the academic interest of internationally  acclaimed
institutions such as Unesco, the World Wildlife Fund, etc. This  reminds  us
of our responsibility to treat with sensitivity and respect what nature  has
provided for us.

We are doing this not only for our children, but for the good of the  entire
world. We are also reminded of the challenge of accommodating the  needs  of
all our people. These  needs  are  often  in  direct  competition  with  one
another within the confines of what we have.

My speech here today in the NCOP would be incomplete if I  did  not  explain
how the Western Cape Chief Directorate of Environmental Affairs is going  to
support our premier and our government of the Western  Cape  in  respect  of
the four pillars of concern that we have  identified  as  being  central  to
sustainable development for the Western Cape and its people.  Here  I  refer
to HIV/Aids, poverty eradication, safety  and  security,  crime  prevention,
tourism and business development.

As far as poverty eradication is concerned, legal requirements in  terms  of
the regulations under the Environment Conservation Act in respect of  public
participation on the impact of development on the  environment  has  created
job opportunities for the unskilled sector. [Time Expired.] [Applause.]

Cllr Z BREY (Salga):  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members  and
special  delegates,  section  26  (2)  in  Chapter   6   of   the   National
Environmental Management Act of 1998 makes provision for the  Department  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism to compile an  annual  performance  report
on sustainable development. Furthermore, the Act indicates that  the  report
should cover information from all spheres  of  government  where  activities
are in line with Agenda 21.

Many problems and solutions that will be addressed by the implementation  of
section 26 of Nema will have their roots  in  local  activities.  This  will
mean the participation and co-operation of local  authorities  in  providing
information for the Nema report  which  will  be  a  determining  factor  in
fulfilling Nema's objectives.

As a basis for action,  it  should  be  understood  that  local  authorities
construct,  operate  and  maintain  economic,   social   and   environmental
infrastructure. They  also  oversee  planning  processes  and  assist  local
environmental policies and regulations and assist in  implementing  national
and subnational policies. Salga believes that for the proper  implementation
of section 26 of  Nema,  the  involvement  of  local  government  can  be  a
positive  move  in   identifying   constraints   and   priorities   on   the
implementation of Agenda 21 in South Africa.

The responsibilities of  Salga  in  ensuring  the  implementation  of  Local
Agenda 21 at local levels are  enormous.  That  is  even  supported  by  the
signed  memorandum  of  agreement  between  Salga  and  the  Department   of
Environmental Affairs and  Tourism,  in  which  Salga  agreed  to  take  the
responsibility of co-ordinating all activities of Local Agenda 21  at  local
level. The memorandum of agreement which was signed on 22 March 2001  placed
an extra burden on Salga, whereby Salga's business plan  has  had  to  shift
and focus on integrating the concept  of  sustainable  development  and  the
principles of Agenda 21.

Most people argue that the future cannot be predicted,  but  the  key  issue
for the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism is to  perceive  the
role of local governments in engaging in programmes of  implementing  Agenda
21 after  the  Johannesburg  Summit.  If  the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism is of the  view  that  local  government  will  play  an
important role in implementing Local Agenda 21 programmes, then there  is  a
need for them to budget for the implementation of Local Agenda 21  at  local
level.

Local government is closest to the people and this gives it a vital role  in
educating our people and mobilising and responding quickly to the public  in
any programmes or projects that promote sustainable development. The  trends
of expenditure reflected in this Budget Vote do not  cover  expenditure  for
local  governments  to  implement  projects  and  programmes  of  Agenda  21
effectively.

In conclusion, Salga is of the view that many components of the  process  of
sustainable development are already happening at local level,  because  they
are not new. But the key issues for our Government  are  financial  support,
recognition  and  appraisal  for  those  local  governments  who  have  made
progress on the implementation of Local Agenda 21. Salga also believes  that
with Local  Agenda  21  the  principle  of  interconnectedness  is  applied,
therefore, the three spheres of government should  work  hand  in  hand  for
better results in implementing the programmes of Agenda 21 [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, Minister  Valli  Moosa,  MEC's  and  colleagues,
having had the opportunity to be briefed on the Department of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism's strategic plan for the three-year period from 2002  to
2005, and to consider the relevant document  objectively,  I  wish,  in  the
first instance, to mention that the New NP supports this  Budget  Vote  and,
secondly, to offer the Minister a bouquet of the best  that  South  Africa's
floral heritage has to offer.

I do this with pleasure after having taken note  of  the  department's  wide
range of achievements over the past few years. The list of  achievements  is
truly  impressive  and  includes,  inter  alia,  the  declaration  of  South
Africa's first  three  world  heritage  sites,  the  opening  of  the  first
transfrontier conservation park  in  Southern  Africa  and  the  signing  of
agreements to establish several transfrontier conservation parks and  areas,
the White Paper on Sustainable Coastal Management  and  declaration  of  the
first whale sanctuary in South Africa, the allocation  of  the  first  long-
term rights in the fishing industry and the crackdown on illegal  activities
responsible for the depletion  and  criminal  destruction  of  our  valuable
marine resources and heritage and last, but not least,  the  publication  of
regulations banning thin plastic  bags  and  prohibiting  4x4  vehicles  and
other private vehicles on our beaches.

Ek het twee jaar gelede, tong in die kies, na plastieksakke  verwys  as  die
nuwe nasionale blom van  Suid-Afrika.  Met  verwysing  na  die  laaste  twee
prestasies word ek ongelukkig ook genoop  om  die  Minister  'n  ruiker  van
hierdie nuwe nasionale blom van Suid-Afrika aan te bied.

Daar is  met  groot  opgewondenheid  in  bewaringskringe  uitgesien  na  die
betrokke regulasies. Die groot teleurstelling het egter 'n ruk gelede  gekom
toe dit geblyk het dat die plastiekregulasies in 'n  baie  afgewaterde  vorm
toegepas gaan word. Gister was dit weer  die  slag  dat  mense  tog,  hoewel
tydelik, toegelaat gaan word om met  hul  duur  speelgoed  op  St  Lucia  se
strande te kerjakker.

Ek aanvaar dat die Minister en sy departement sekerlik hul bes doen  om  die
regulasies in hul oorspronklik bedoelde vorms toegepas te kry,  en  dus  nie
alleen vir hierdie heeltemal onaanvaarbare situasie te blameer  is  nie.  In
ander lande word papiersakke,  of  mense  se  eie  houers,  gebruik  om  hul
inkopies in te pak. Pakkers in supermarkte hoef dus nie regtig hul  werk  te
verloor nie.

Wat die argument oor toerusting  vir  die  vervaardiging  van  plastieksakke
betref, is daar 'n ou spreuk wat sê: waar daar 'n wil is, is  daar  'n  weg.
Kan daar nie weer eens met Minister Erwin  en  Minister  Manuel  onderhandel
word om sekere belasting- en ander toegewings  aan  plastieksakvervaardigers
te maak om die vervaardigingstoerusting vinniger af  te  skryf  en,  in  die
belang van  'n  skoon  Suid-Afrika,  met  toerusting  te  vervang  wat  meer
omgewingsvriendelike verpakkingsmateriaal vervaardig nie?

Wat vierwielaangedrewe voertuie op strande betref, is ek  bevrees  dat  daar
'n gaatjie in die dyk gemaak is, en dat  die  Minister  nou  oorstroom  gaan
word met aansoeke om uitsonderings. Op  watter  gronde  sal  daar  nou,  ten
gunste van rykes met duur  vierwielaangedrewe  voertuie,  op  'n  erge  wyse
gediskrimineer kan word teen Suid-Afrikaners met goedkoper voertuie wat  ook
op strande sal wil ry om vis te  vang  wat  brood  op  hulle  tafels  plaas?
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follow.)

[Two years ago, tongue in cheek, I referred  to  plastic  bags  as  the  new
national  flower  of  South  Africa.  With  reference  to   the   last   two
achievements I am unfortunately also compelled to present the Minister  with
a bouquet of this new national flower of South Africa.

In conservation circles the regulations concerned have been  looked  forward
to with great anticipation. The immense  disappointment,  however,  occurred
some time ago when  it  appeared  that  the  plastic  regulations  would  be
enforced in a very watered-down version. Yesterday there was the  blow  that
people would, although temporarily, be allowed to  career  around  in  their
expensive toys on the beaches of St Lucia.

I accept that the Minister and his  department  are  certainly  doing  their
best to have the regulations enforced in  their  originally  intended  form,
and are therefore  not  solely  to  blame  for  this  entirely  unacceptable
situation. In other countries paper bags, or people's  own  containers,  are
used for their shopping. Packers in supermarkets would therefore not  really
need to lose their jobs.

As far as the argument about equipment for the production  of  plastic  bags
is concerned, there is an old saying that  goes:  Where  there  is  a  will,
there is a way. Would it not  be  possible  to  once  again  negotiate  with
Minister Erwin and Minister  Manuel  to  make  certain  taxation  and  other
concessions  to  plastic  manufacturers  to  write  off  the   manufacturing
equipment more expediently and, in the interest of  a  clean  South  Africa,
replacing it with equipment  that  produces  more  environmentally  friendly
packaging material?
Where four-wheel drive vehicles are concerned, I am  afraid  that  a  little
hole has been made in the dike, and that the Minister is  now  going  to  be
flooded with requests for exemptions. On what grounds would  there  now,  in
favour of the rich  with  expensive  four-wheel  drive  vehicles,  be  harsh
discrimination against South Africans with cheaper vehicles who  would  also
like to drive on the beaches in order to fish to put food on their tables?]

This brings me to another matter which I know  is  dear  to  the  Minister's
heart, as he is the custodian of our heritage, and that is the  question  of
the protection of ecologically sensitive areas which,  if  I  understand  it
correctly, not only include our coasts  but  also  refer  to  tidal  rivers,
lagoons and estuaries. My request  is  that  when  the  department  approves
developments in eco-sensitive areas, they do not give approval subject to  a
long list of conditions which they are not able to police or monitor due  to
a lack of human and other resources. One frequently  finds  that  developers
accept the conditions and afterwards just do exactly what suits them.

Die verdere vraag word gestel wat die sin daarvan is om teen hoë  koste  vir
die belastingbetaler weldeurdagte en beredeneerde ontwikkelingsriglyne  daar
te stel as dit maar net weer geïgnoreer word om 'n ontwikkelaar te  pas?  Ek
verwys spesifiek na 'n substreekgidsplan wat 'n sekere beoogde  ontwikkeling
as ongewens ag, maar waarin die  betrokke  ontwikkelaar  en  sy  konsultante
skynbaar toegelaat word om aansoek te doen om die wysiging van die  gidsplan
ten einde die ontwikkeling te kan akkommodeer.

Volgens die  witskrif  op  volhoubare  kusbestuur  waarna  ek  reeds  as  'n
prestasie verwys het, moet ontwikkelings wat onwenslike impakte  tot  gevolg
sal hê, vermy word. Om op te som: my betoog is dat sover  dit  die  bewaring
van  Suid-Afrika  se  natuurerfenis  betref,  enige   optrede,   hetsy   dit
ontwikkelings of die gebruik van voertuie op strande is,  wat  nie  met  die
beperkte menslike en finansiële hulpbronne ordentlik gemoniteer  en  waarvan
die voorwaardes nie streng en sonder uitsondering afgedwing  kan  word  nie,
liefs vermy moet word tot tyd en wyl ons wel in staat  is  om  die  nakoming
van neergelegde voorwaardes af te dwing. Skade  wat  eers  deur  ondeurdagte
goedkeuring aangerig is, sal nooit weer herstel word nie.  Dit  sal  tot  in
die nageslag as 'n beskuldiging teen ons staan. [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follow.)

[The further question is posed as to what the point is of  developing  well-
considered and calculated  development  guidelines  at  high  cost  for  the
taxpayer when it would only once again be ignored to suit a developer? I  am
specifically referring to a sub-regional guide plan that regards  a  certain
envisaged development as undesirable, but in which the  developer  concerned
and his consultants have apparently been allowed to apply for  amendment  of
the guide plan in order to accommodate the development.

According to the White Paper on  Sustainable  Coastal  Management,  which  I
have already referred to as an accomplishment, developments which will  have
an unfavourable impact should be avoided. To sum up: my argument is that  as
far as it concerns the conservation of South Africa's natural heritage,  any
action, be it developments or the use of vehicles on beaches,  that  cannot,
because of the limited human and financial resources, be properly  monitored
or conditions enforced without exception, should rather be avoided until  we
are able to enforce the agreed upon conditions. Damage  that  once  occurred
because of ill-considered approval can never be repaired. It would still  be
held against us in posterity as an impeachment. [Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Madam Chair, the Northern Province,  like  other  provinces,
is endowed  with  cultural  diversity,  historic  sites  and  many  tourists
attractions. These are, among others, the  Nylsvlei  Nature  Reserve,  which
hosts about 400 species of waterfowl, and Bushveld, the archeological  caves
of Makapane Caves, the annually flooded hot springs  of  Belabela,  that  is
Warmbad, and of course, the Zion city, Moria, with an annual  pilgrimage  of
three million. I can carry on numerating.

Given this background, it sometimes sound paradoxical to rate  the  Northern
Province one of the poorest provinces in the Republic. This  might  raise  a
crucial question as to what extent these natural resources are exploited  to
the betterment of the lives of the historically disadvantaged Limpopians.  I
just want to raise one other observation here on tourism.  This  is  related
to access roads. From my youth, I knew that roads that lead  to  the  Kruger
National Park, such as the White River-Skukuza, the Hazyview-Lisbon and  the
Klaserie-Orpen gate roads, were tarred as early as  the  sixties,  and  that
they cut through the poverty-stricken villages.

Within the Kruger Park, accommodation facilities that  approximate  3  to  4
star hotel standards have been constructed for the purpose  of  meeting  the
needs of the white tourists, be they from  within  the  country  or  abroad.
Subsequent  to  these  developments,  the   Manyeleti   Game   Reserve   was
established specifically to serve ``swartmense'', with  inferior  facilities
and a very limited area of touring. It is  often  overcrowded,  since  black
tourists and schools from as far as Gauteng and the Free State have  flooded
this particular resort.

The situation is aggravated by the deplorable conditions of access roads  to
Manyeleti Game Reserve. The Acornhoek-Islington  and  Rolle-Edinburgh  roads
are the only two principal roads that connect to  Manyeleti.  Manyeleti  was
established in the mid-sixties,  and  since  then  no  government  has  ever
thought of tarring these  roads.  Even  today,  while  I  am  standing  here
talking, those roads are not  tarred.  The  need  probably  never  presented
itself on  account  that  it  was  only  the  black  majority  tourists  and
motorists that patronised these roads.  Rainy  seasons  render  these  roads
impassable, and thus impact negatively on eco-tourism.  I  therefore  appeal
to the hon the Minister to look into this matter, especially given the  fact
that there are two subprogrammes  under  Tourism,  namely  Tourism  Business
Development and the poverty relief programme, with an expenditure budget  of
R6,2 million and R86 million respectively.

I just want to touch on another observation. This concerns tourist  airports
in the Northern Province in particular. I am referring to those airports  of
destination from which tourists alight before  they  can  start  driving  to
their  respective  rest  camps.  Their  points  of  location  tend   to   be
unhospitable, or unfriendly to the local  communities.  Take,  for  example,
Hoedspruit Airport. It is located approximately 40 km away from the  nearest
and  supposed  beneficiaries,  which  are  the  Acornhoek  and   Greenvalley
communities. I do not even have to mention Skukuza Airport and others.

As a development of this year's theme, namely as already alluded to  by  the
Minister, ``Responsible Tourism'', the relocation of these tourist  airports
needs to be reviewed to enable the motto, ``Batho Pele'' to be  operational.
The airport should be located within easy reach of the beneficiaries - I  am
referring to the historically disadvantaged -  and  where  feasible,  within
the villages. By the by, it is these rural  and  historically  disadvantaged
majority who have lived to an old age without having had  the  privilege  of
putting his or her hand on the body of an aeroplane.

The tourists' practice of alighting far away from our  traditional  villages
deprive tourists themselves the opportunity  to  visit  cultural  attraction
centres such as the Valembe Kraal, Bakone Malapa, Modjadji Kraal, etc.  Rest
camps and wildlife seem to enjoy a bigger share of the tourism  industry  by
far than the local communities. Direct interaction between the local  people
and tourists will pave the way for the marketing of man-made artefacts.

In our area in the Northern Province, we realise that there are  people  who
are weaving beads, they are making clay pots, and other carved artefacts.  I
think if we can  have  these  airports,  one  or  two,  somehow  within  the
villages, they would give create interaction between the villagers who  were
historically disadvantaged and the tourists. Perhaps that would also  create
a platform where they would be able to sell their crafts and other things.

Ms G C BARRY (Eastern Cape): Madam Chairperson, I would like  to  extend  an
apology on behalf of the hon Enoch Godongwana, who  is  the  Eastern  Cape's
MEC for economic affairs, environment and tourism. He is unable to  be  here
today due to the budget debates that are taking place in our legislature.

The Minister in his Budget speech  made  mention  of  the  fact  that  black
economic empowerment and the promotion  of  small,  medium  and  micro-sized
enterprises are  and  continue  to  be  an  integral  part  of  Government's
strategy.

The Eastern Cape, being mainly  rural  with  high  unemployment,  sees  this
strategy as a means to bring some form of relief to the poorest of the  poor
in our province. Provinces have an important role to  play  in  creating  an
environment  that  is  attractive  to  tourists.  Provinces  also   have   a
responsibility as custodians of the environment, and  this  requires  policy
to protect the environment. It is encouraging  that  South  Africa  has  now
produced  National  Responsible  Tourism  Development  Guidelines,   and   a
National Ecotourism Development Strategy.

Tourism education and awareness programmes among the  indigenous  people  of
South Africa will go a long way towards preparing them  for  future  tourism
developments. A major investment outside a central city area  is  likely  to
have some impact on the nearest communities. Developers should consult  with
local government authorities  at  an  early  stage  in  the  planning  of  a
proposal, and be prepared to explain proposed projects  or  developments  to
the local community.

Investors and developers should  be  aware  that  indigenous  people  attach
strong cultural values to land. Local communities should be consulted at  an
early stage if investment decisions are likely to  involve  land  identified
as being spiritually important, or land subject to legal claim. In  general,
once host community support is given, it will be sustained  in  a  way  that
will positively enhance the development. There is growing recognition  that,
in addition to providing sustainable economic opportunities  for  indigenous
people, the development of authentic tourism experiences can also  encourage
training, and the preservation of local skills, arts and crafts.

There is a great potential for cultural tourism but there is a  need  for  a
national cultural  tourism  strategy  to  link  authentic  cultural  tourism
experiences with the development of arts and crafts in South  Africa.  Until
such time as there is  a  significant  increase  in  the  critical  mass  of
tourists, many cultural villages and craft centres will  not  be  viable  if
they only depend on tourists for custom. The education of the masses on  our
heritage can be achieved much more effectively if they  derive  an  economic
benefit from the development of  traditional  arts  and  crafts,  sport  and
entertainment.  There  is  nothing  more  demotivating  for  crafters   than
accumulative stock that is not selling, or for performers  than  not  having
an audience.

Export markets for arts and crafts  need  to  be  developed,  especially  in
countries where there are bilateral agreements with South  Africa.  Research
needs to be undertaken in these countries to investigate  opportunities  for
export. This could  determine  what  commodities  need  to  be  crafted  and
subsequently what skills need to  be  developed.  In  addition  to  cultural
tourism, marine living resources is another area from which  communities  in
our  province  can  make  a  living.  The  Eastern  Cape   inshore   coastal
environment can be broadly divided into three  habitats,  namely  estuaries,
sand beaches, and rocky shores.

Within each of these regions,  marine  resources  are  exploited  mainly  by
recreational and subsistence fishers. Inshore commercial  fisheries  include
both legal  and  illegal  utilisation,  which  has  been  noted  to  require
significant  attention  through  co-operation  between  Marine  and  Coastal
Management and the department in our province.

The marine living resources' guiding principles  of  equity,  sustainability
and stability promote a broadening in the focus of the management of  marine
resources. They include the promotion of socioeconomic benefits for  coastal
communities. Along with this goes a greater emphasis on  the  management  of
inshore and coastal resources as opposed to the traditional emphasis on  the
offshore industrial fisheries.

There is, however, a lack of detailed policy linked to the provinces in  the
management of various fisheries to achieve the sound objectives of the  Act.
It is important, however, that we acknowledge the positive  steps  taken  by
Marine and Coastal Management to deal with the question  of  black  economic
empowerment. However, there is still a  need  to  engage  with  the  coastal
provinces on issues of co-ordinated  institutional  capacity  and  processes
that seek to  promote  an  integrated  people-centred  approach  to  coastal
management.

As the Eastern Cape, we would like to thank the Minister and his  department
for their support and for the work currently  under  way  in  our  province.
Having said that, we request the Minister also to give consideration to  the
issues we are raising here today, as we believe that  this  will  contribute
greatly to realising our strategic objective of creating a better  life  for
all.

The Eastern Cape supports the budget  of  the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism. [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Mgcinisihlalo, ngiyabonga kutfola lelitfuba lekutsi  nami
ngibe yincenye yalenkhulumomphikiswano. [Chairperson, I am very grateful  to
get this opportunity and be part of this debate.]

The Minister has spoken, the  MECs  have  spoken  and  now  I  am  speaking.
[Laughter.] Let me enter this debate with appreciation  of  the  commendable
work the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism  has  done  and  is
doing for our country and its people. Firstly, it has  made  great  strides,
in collaboration with other departments  and  stakeholders,  in  preparation
for the upcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development. Of course, we  may
have concerns on certain  matters,  but  we  are  assured  that  success  is
guaranteed.

We have in the past proved, as a country, that we  are  a  world-class  host
for summits of such  magnitude,  and  we  dare  not  fail  this  time.  More
important than this is that the summit has sustainable  poverty  alleviation
programmes as an outcome to the benefit of developing countries.

To say a few words on tourism, which has become  one  of  the  significantly
growing industries in the country, it is not only  growing  because  of  the
rand-dollar ratio. Aggressive and vigorous marketing  strategies  have  been
put in place and  implemented.  Hence  we  are  reaping  the  fruits  today.
However, it needs all of us - politicians, the media and civil society -  to
collectively  sustain  this  momentum.  I   have   purposely   referred   to
politicians, as it is really bad and irresponsible for  the  likes  of  Tony
Leon to be speaking  badly  about  our  country  in  his  fundraising  spree
abroad. The role certain  components  of  the  media  play  leaves  much  in
question. [Interjections.] Regarding the role of the  media,  let  us  take,
for example, that train accident near Durban. One could  see  corpses  lying
around, and even kids could see  such  things  on  TV,  and  that  does  not
encourage tourists to come to this country. When we had the tragic  incident
in America on 11 September, I did not even see a single  corpse.  If  anyone
claims to have seen a corpse during that coverage, I think that person  must
have been dreaming.

The culture in our society of being hospitable and  friendly  also  enhances
tourism success. I would like to share with hon members  an  experience  one
person had in an altercation with a tourist.

Satsi sikulomunye umbungatfo, kucocwa ngetekuvakasha, latsi lelinye  lijaha,
latsi lisendleleni lashayisana  kabi  nalelinye  likhehla.  Lakhipha  sandla
lenta lolunye luphawu lengingeke  ngilukhiphe  kuleNdlu.  Lelikhehla  latsi;
hawu, nguyona ndlela leniphatsa ngayo  tivakashi  kulelive?  Litsi  lelijaha
lativa linemahloni kakhulu kabi, futsi ngeke asaphindza akwenta loko.  Ngako
kubalulekile kutsi sibokukhutsata kutsi kube nemasiko ekuphatsana  ngebuhle,
sikhone kutsi bantfu sibemukele kahle.  (Translation  of  Siswati  paragraph
follows.)

[It so happened that while we were in the middle  of  a  conversation  at  a
certain party, one young man told us that one day he came across an old  man
and at that old man he shook his fist in a queer manner,  something  that  I
cannot demonstrate right now in this House. The old man said: ``Oh, is  this
the way in which you treat tourists in this country of  yours?''  The  young
man said that he felt so very embarrassed  that  he  would  never  again  do
that. Therefore, it is very  important  that  we  encourage  good  reception
procedures, and that we should display proper behaviour towards tourists.]

I would like to state that the tourism industry is also an important  avenue
for economic transformation.

Sesikhatsele kubona labamphisholo bayincenye  yalemboni  ngekugidza  sibhaca
batfole  bosheleni  kube  kantsi  bondlebe   tikhany'ilanga   bona   batfola
bompondo.  [Uhleko.]  Kudzala  siqombola   imiqansa   kugqunsuke   tincotfo.
[Uhleko.] (Translation of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[We are sick and tired of seeing  black  people  being  assistants  in  that
industry, only doing sibhaca dancing and having a few coins thrown  to  them
whilst the whites get pounds. [Laughter.] It has been a long time  since  we
have been  struggling  to  climb  steep  mountains  and  ropes  are  frayed.
[Laughter.]]

Now is the time to ensure that the funds allocated for economic  empowerment
really change the racial imbalance in this industry.

I will move over to other components of the department,  unlike  the  member
who concentrated only on fishing, as if this department was a department  of
fishing  only.  [Interjections.]  Actually  I  must  say  that  the   select
committee did acknowledge that there had been  problems  and  weaknesses  in
the process of issuing quotas in the fishing industry. However,  we  decided
to use proper and effective channels or procedures to address such  matters.
In particular, we would not like to see subsistence fishing  compromised  at
the expense of commercial fishing. Of course  a  balance  will  have  to  be
struck.

However, it is my view that  such  a  matter  cannot  be  amicably  resolved
through this parliamentary debate. In short, we  should  not  use  Harksen's
deutschmarks to rent a crowd and conduct street jive debates, thinking  that
we have solved the problems. Unfortunately the hon  Versfeld  swept  out  of
this House in a rush after delivering her speech. I do not know,  maybe  she
was in a rush to offer a ``dop'' [drink] to her  exploited  crowd  which  is
being recruited to top up the DP or DA membership on  the  eve  of  crossing
the floor. [Laughter.] I have lately  learnt  that  they  were  stealing  T-
shirts, which is also a  criminal  charge.  [Interjections.]  I  must  state
categorically and clearly ...

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, on a point of order ...

An HON MEMBER: You were not asked to speak. Wait for the Chair to  say  that
you may speak.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, member, what is your point of order?

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I would consider it completely unparliamentary  for
a member to address part of the gallery as an exploited crowd who are  going
to be offered a ``dop''. I believe that  he  should  withdraw  that  remark.
[Interjections.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: May I continue, Chairperson? [Interjections.]

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, may I also rise on a point of order?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: What is the point of order?

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, I think the hon member herself is  out  of  order
and you should rule as such, so that the hon member Windvoël  can  continue.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Very well, the hon member may continue. I  am
going to going to look into the matter. My Afrikaans is not good. I  do  not
have a full grasp of the concept of a ``dop'', but I will ask  for  that  to
be looked into so as to decide whether that sentence was  out  of  order  or
not. I personally am not clear about the term. The hon member may continue.

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: I must state categorically and  clearly  that  I  am  not
referring to the innocent citizens of this country who are in  the  gallery,
but only to those who went out at the same time as the hon Versfeld.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, would you  please  continue  with
the debate? [Interjections.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: I later learnt that she was crying  outside.  [Laughter.]
I must say that politics is not for the  faint-hearted.  Tigers  never  cry.
[Laughter.] [Interjections.] One  cannot  talk  of  fishing  without  caring
about the environment.

I will  now  focus  on  some  of  the  environmental  issues  which  are  of
importance. As we are talking, half of  the  world's  rivers  are  seriously
depleted and polluted. About 60% of the 227 biggest rivers are disrupted  by
dams and engineering works.  One  third  of  the  world's  fish  stocks  are
depleted and overexploited. If one concentrates only  on  fishing  and  does
not look at the environment, one will end up  fishing  oneself  out  of  the
environment. [Interjections.]

Contaminated shellfish cause an estimated 2,5 million  cases  of  infectious
hepatitis annually, resulting in 25 000  deaths.  Concentrations  of  carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere could double by the year 2050. This would  have  a
great effect on the course of climate change. The number of people  affected
by weather-related disasters has risen to 211 million in 10  years.  Already
40% of the world is short of fresh water. In 30  years  this  will  rise  to
50%, and we should be asking ourselves what  we  are  doing  as  a  country,
given the fact that 2003 is an international year dedicated to fresh water.

There are 4 billion cases of diarrhoea or  cholera  annually,  resulting  in
2,2 million deaths a year. At least 15% of the earth is  degraded  by  human
activities. If we continue at this rate, in 30  years  70%  of  the  earth's
surface will be suffering severe impacts. Now is the time to  take  care  of
our environment. No one else will do for us what we can do for ourselves.

As the ANC we support this Vote. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL  AFFAIRS  AND  TOURISM:  Chairperson,  let  me
express my gratitude to all the members who  participated  in  this  debate.
All but one were really constructive, I think, and we  will  certainly  take
note of all the comments that were made.

Let me assure hon members that what normally happens is that  our  director-
general draws up a table of all the comments that have been  made.  This  is
brought to the attention of the relevant officials  in  the  department  and
the institutions linked to the department, and throughout the year we  track
the response  and  the  progress  relating  to  the  comments,  suggestions,
requests and criticisms made in Parliament. None of the  contributions  will
go to waste, therefore.

MEC  Mabena  made  the  point  about  the  African  Peace  Through   Tourism
Conference, and I  would  like  to  use  this  opportunity  to  commend  the
province  of  Mpumalanga  for  the  wonderful  achievement  of  hosting  the
international  conference  for  the  African  continent  on  peace   through
tourism. I enjoyed the brief period that I spent there.

It is also particularly important because, during these  troubled  times  in
the world, tourism is one field through which it is possible to get  nations
to understand one another. We have  the  world  being  divided  today  along
racial and religious lines, and  it  is  by  travelling  to  other  people's
countries and learning about other people's cultures  that  the  concept  of
peace gets built at  grass-roots  level.  So  I  think  that  was  quite  an
important conference.

The hon Vilakazi said a number of things about her wonderful province.  What
I should have said here - I did not because of time constraints, but  I  did
say it in the Minmec meeting - is that  the  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal  is
doing extremely well in its tourism promotion work. In  fact,  the  branding
of the province as the Kingdom of the Zulu - as in ``Visit  the  Kingdom  of
the Zulu'' - is, I think a brand that works for the rest of the country.  It
is not only being marketed internationally, but also in the  rest  of  South
Africa. The point that I made at the Minmec  is  that  it  is  the  approach
which we would like to see taken more  and  more  at  provincial  level  and
also, as I have mentioned, at city level.

I want to thank the thank the Free State province for the  manner  in  which
they responded to the roadshow on the Johannesburg World Summit, which  went
quite a long way towards informing the people of the Free  State  about  the
WSSD. The hon Kent Durr is not here; he sent a note to  me  saying  that  he
had to leave. Maybe he should have sent a note to you, Chairperson.

As far as the West Coast National Park is concerned, it is a very  important
national park for us. It has an extremely  unique  biodiversity  and  it  is
also in an extremely sensitive zone, both from  an  environmental  point  of
view and also from a  cultural  point  of  view.  Some  of  the  very  early
evidence of human activity has now been found in  the  West  Coast  National
Park area - in some of the coastal midlands and also, as hon  members  would
remember,  the  very  important  globally  significant  find  of  fossilised
footprints recently.

The Chief Executive Officer of the SA National Parks, Mr Mavuso Msimang,  is
fortunately sitting here on the officials' benches. He has just informed  me
that he has taken note of the comments that have been made, and he has  also
informed me that he agrees fully with  what  Mr  Durr  has  said  about  the
expansion of the park and the acquisition of the Defence Force  land,  which
is next to the park. In fact, he said I should say here that he agrees  with
everything that Mr Durr has said, and that he is working on it and  pursuing
it also. We are happy that we are getting this  kind  of  support  from  the
National Council of Provinces.

Mr Gelderblom mentioned the importance of the mass market and  of  meetings,
incentives, conferences, etc, which the Western Cape is now having with  the
new  convention  centre  here.  We  have  wonderful  convention   facilities
elsewhere and we would certainly like to give great  emphasis  to  promoting
South Africa as one of  the  world's  best  destinations  for  meetings  and
conferences.

The World Summit on Sustainable Development will also take  us  a  long  way
towards that. I take the point which Councillor Barry is  making  about  the
need  to  give  recognition  to  those  local  governments  that  are  doing
something about Local Agenda 21. I think that this is an important  point  -
the clean town campaign. It is  a  way  of  giving  recognition  to  certain
elements. I think that she is quite right. We will certainly look into  that
and see how we can take that further.
Regarding the point that Mr Conroy  made,  I  think  he  has  been  able  to
capture  very  well  the  many  grey  areas  that  exist   in   implementing
environmental legislation. I would like to assure him  that  since  we  came
out with the 4x4 regulations, there has been nothing but public support  for
them. Throughout the country there is public support.  People  do  not  want
vehicles and bakkies to be driven on the beach.

The regulations allow the Minister to make  exceptions  under  very  special
circumstances. We have made a number of  exceptions  since  the  regulations
came into force. Many of those  have  been  around  things  like  recognised
fishing tournaments.  There  I  got  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Sport  and
Recreation, Minister Balfour, to give recommendations  that  such  and  such
was a bona fide sporting activity. For a very limited period in a  regulated
way, we would then allow for some sort of driving to take place.

In the case of St Lucia, the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government  and,  more
particularly, the greater St Lucia Park Wetland  Park  Authority,  which  is
the authority for the world heritage site, have made representations to  us.
Through  lengthy  discussions,  we  have  decided  to  now  give  a  limited
exemption for that area. What we have asked for  is  for  the  authority  to
give us a detailed proposal before we consider any permanent  exemption  for
that area. So they are in consultation and are  developing  a  proposal  for
us. KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife is also involved in that process.

I would just like to say to the hon Nyakane that the Manyeleti Game  Reserve
belongs to his province. It does not belong to the national Government.  The
hon member should perhaps raise  that  in  the  provincial  legislature.  Of
course, I have expressed the view to the province that  we  should  consider
incorporating Manyeleti into the Kruger National Park so that  we  are  able
to deal with it in a more comprehensive, consolidated sort of way.  That  is
a discussion which we will continue having with the Northern Province.

May I say to the hon Windvoël that we are trying to take a number  of  steps
in order to redress the imbalance in the tourism industry. I have  mentioned
to him that we have now put out this booklet, which  gives  a  comprehensive
guide to the kind of assistance and  support  that  emerging  businesses  in
tourism can get. We have supported about 200  black-owned  enterprises  from
all nine provinces to  be  at  the  Indaba,  where  they  get  international
marketing exposure.  A  number  of  steps  have  been  taken.  This  is  not
something that is easy, but it is something that,  certainly,  we  have  set
for ourselves as a priority.

We have also taken a decision in Cabinet  that  all  Government  departments
have now been given  targets  about  their  procurement  in  the  fields  of
catering, hospitality, accommodation and such things - the tourism areas.  A
percentage of the procurement must be from black-owned enterprises.  We  are
tracking the performance of Government departments and we will be  reporting
to Cabinet, because this is an instrument  that  can  be  used  to  generate
business for emerging businesses. Although it is good enough  to  set  up  a
black-owned  enterprise,  one  needs  somebody  to  do  business  with  that
enterprise. So we are encouraging  Government  departments  to  do  that.  I
would certainly encourage provincial governments to do that also.

As far as all of the hot air from the hon Versfeld is concerned,  I  do  not
know how  to  respond  to  her.  However,  I  am  quite  certain  that  you,
Chairperson, and hon members would be quite surprised at  the  profusion  of
blustering that we saw there and would wonder what really is  behind  it.  I
thought that perhaps I should take my time to comment  on  that,  because  I
have also seen the hon member make certain  statements  in  the  newspapers.
The first point to make is  that  during  the  allocation  process  the  hon
Versfeld  expressed  -  Rev  Moatshe  would  know  -  support  for  the  new
allocation process, the way it is going to be done, etc. In fact,  she  came
personally to congratulate me on how things are being done,  etc.  She  went
out to certain people in the area in  which  she  does  political  work  and
promised quotas. She  actually  made  promises.  [Interjections.]  She  made
false promises to people. What she did not tell  innocent  fisherpersons  is
that, in fact,  she  is  not  in  Government,  that  her  party  is  not  in
Government and that they do not make  the  allocations.  She  did  not  tell
people that. [Interjections.]

If I could have the attention of the House  ...  Many  of  the  applications
that came into the  department  -  I  have  seen  the  applications  myself,
because during the appeal process I personally scrutinised the  applications
- have actually been done on the letterheads of her party, the DA, or on  DP
letterheads. I cannot remember which ones. One will find that  she  actually
went out to make false promises. [Interjections.]

I do not know why my own members do not want to listen  to  me.  [Laughter.]
Having made these false promises, she was then unable to explain why,  after
the allocations were made, some people got fishing rights and some did  not.
This is because not everyone who applies will get a fishing right.  We  have
a large number of people who  make  applications  and  there  is  a  limited
amount of fish stocks. In fact, what she had done was to go to  one  of  the
senior officials in my department and plead, saying that she was  now  going
to be in a lot of trouble with her own party. She said: ``I do not know  how
I will explain to Tony Leon that these people are now not going to vote  for
us.'' As a result of this one will find completely irrational  behaviour  on
her part. She has behaved since then ...

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, on a point of  order.  The  hon  Minister  is
deliberately  misleading  the  House.  He  is   not   telling   the   truth.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The point is noted. It  will  be  easy
to follow this up.

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM:  Chairperson,  if  I  may
say so, members of the public should know that the way we work with  fishing
allocations is that we work in an honest way, in a  transparent  manner  and
that this is driven by rules. No member of Parliament,  no  politician  from
any party, not even from  the  majority  party,  decides  who  gets  fishing
rights, because as soon as an MP decides that it is corruption.  The  public
must know that the hon Versfeld has no  influence  whatsoever  over  fishing
allocations, and she should not be making false promises and  then  come  to
Parliament and behave in a completely irrational manner. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

        DISESTABLISHMENT OF SOUTH AFRICAN HOUSING TRUST LIMITED BILL`

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, there is such a noise that I cannot hear.  Can  I
go on?

The South African Housing Trust Limited was  established  as  a  company  in
January 1987, following discussions between the Government and  the  private
sector during 1986. They then agreed on a joint venture  to  be  established
outside the Government in order to create the facilitation and  the  funding
of housing directed  at  the  lower-income  segment  of  the  South  African
population in a way which would maximise job security.

Two subsidiaries  of  the  company  were  also  established,  namely  Nu-Way
Housing Developments (Pty) Ltd, and Khayalethu Home Loans (Pty)  Ltd,  which
catered for the property development business and home loan business of  the
company respectively. Government funded the  company  through  interest-free
loans. The delay in and low profitability of stand sales together  with  the
bond repayment boycotts by home owners severely hampered the growth  of  the
company and the company had substantially accumulated losses for each  year,
from 1995 to 1998. The Government did not see its way open  to  subsidise  a
company that was losing large amounts of money, and subsequently decided  to
restructure the company in 1999. The first step was taken  during  1999  and
2000 when the company sold the two subsidiaries - Nu-Way and Khayalethu.

After the  sale  the  assets  of  the  company  that  remained  amounted  to
approximately R70 million, whilst the liabilities amounted to  approximately
R570 million. The Cabinet then also agreed that steps  should  be  taken  to
disestablish the company. The Bill now seeks  to  disestablish  the  company
with effect from 1 July 2002. All the  rights  and  assets  of  the  company
will,  from  the  said  date,  vest  in  the  National  Housing  Development
Corporation, while all the obligations and  liabilities  will  vest  in  the
Government as national state debt and the Government becomes bound  to  meet
these obligations and liabilities.

Payments  made  and  to  be  made  in  future  by  Government  to  meet  the
obligations and liabilities will be  direct  charges  against  the  National
Revenue Fund and may not be  defrayed  from  funds  appropriated  under  the
Housing Vote in the Appropriation Act of 2001. The  housing  subsidy  system
has now taken over the function of  the  company  and  the  noble  ideal  to
promote and facilitate affordable  shelter  is  still  a  reality.  The  new
owners of the new subsidiaries absorbed all the  beneficiaries  of  the  two
companies.

The Bill is actually a condonation of a decision taken by the Government  to
deal with the assets and liabilities of the company as  far  back  as  March
1998.

The Select Committee on Public Service has considered the Bill and  requests
the House to approve the Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  Before  I  conclude,  noting  the  hon
Versfeld's statement, I find it difficult to respond  because  she  has  not
said exactly on what point the Minister was misleading the  House  and  even
then, deliberately misleading the House.

The Council adjourned at 16:50.

Introduction

This  Parliamentary  Committee  (hereinafter  called  the   Committee)   was
established as an Ad Hoc Committee in 1996 and at the end of 1998  became  a
Standing Committee. The specific role of this committee is  to  monitor  and
oversee Government's implementation of the United Nations Convention on  the
Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against  Women  (CEDAW)  and  the
Beijing Platform for Action. One of the priorities set by the committee  was
to address itself to their oversight function regarding  the  monitoring  of
violence against  women.  In  this  regard,  the  Committee  has  undertaken
several activities, which are discussed below.

Activities of the Committee

1.    Violence Against Women Hearings during 1997 and 1999

The Portfolio Committee on Justice and the Ad Hoc  Committee  held  hearings
during 1997 and 1998 on Violence Against Women.  A  report1  was  tabled  in
this regard. Part of  the  1998  hearings  also  focused  on  other  aspects
relating to gender and justice. These include Domestic Violence,  the  legal
system, spousal killings, sexual offences and sexual offence pilot courts.

At the time of these hearings, the Committee made a call  that  the  Justice
Ministry and other role-players accelerate the introduction of the  proposed
legislation on Domestic Violence and  comprehensive  legislation  on  sexual
offences against women. To date, the  Domestic  Violence  Act  (Act  116  of
1998) has been enacted but the Sexual Offences  legislation  has  still  not
come before Parliament.

2.    Violence Against Women Hearings - November 1999

The Committee held hearings from the 8th  to  the  17th  of  November  1999.
Written and oral submissions were made. The objective of the  hearings  were
to:


  *   Identify what and where the blockages are which impede women who have
       been victims of all forms of violence, from having access to justice.
  *   Determine the varied ways in which such obstacles to justice  can  be
       addressed and eliminated.

The  report  emanating  from  the  hearings  thematically  categorises   the
information under the following headings:


  *   Criminal Justice.
  *   Law enforcement.
  *   Welfare services and shelter.
  *   Health care.
  *   Incarceration of offenders.
  *   Recent research on violence against women.
  *   Public awareness and education.
  *   Allocation of financial resources and the Budget.
  *   Inter-ministerial co-operation and co-operative governance.
  *   Co-operation between Government and civil society.
  *   The need for statistical databases.

Although the hearings were held before the  Domestic  Violence  Act  116  of
1998 came into operation, it highlighted difficulties anticipated  with  the
implementation of the legislation. Many of these difficulties  also  emerged
later in a workshop held by the Committee after the  implementation  of  the
Act. The Committee furthermore  makes  very  specific  recommendations  with
regards to the different thematic areas.

In addition to the detailed report on the hearings, a summary  report  (July
2001) is also available.

3.    Provincial visits

Delegations  from  the  Committee  visited   Nelspruit,   Mpumalanga,   Port
-Elizabeth  and  Pietersburg  from  April  to  June   2000.   They   visited
Magistrates, the South  African  Police  Service  (SAPS)  Commissioners  and
Prosecutors. These meetings formed part  of  the  Committee's  investigation
into the difficulties experienced by these officials in  the  implementation
on the Domestic Violence Act and Maintenance Act 99 of 1998.

4.     A  Joint  2-day  workshop  between  the  Committee  and  the   Public
    Participation Unit (PPU) of Parliament, 25 - 26 July 2001.

The Parliamentary Public Participation Unit PPU) and the Committee  convened
a National Conference on enhancing the participation of  women  in  the  law
making process.
The objectives of the conference were to:


  *   Audit the experiences of civil society with respect to how women have
       experienced participation in the legislative processes.
  *   Audit the obstacles which impede the participation of women.
  *   Elicit information on how the participation of women can be improved.


  *   Gather and collate information on problems experienced  with  respect
       to the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act.
  *   Gather and collate information on problems experienced  with  respect
       to the implementation of the Maintenance Act.
  *   Reflect on methodologies for making gendered impact  on  how  budgets
       are drawn up and  how  public  sector  resources  are  allocated  (at
       national, provincial and local levels).
  *   Gather and collate information  on  women's  legislative  needs  with
       respect to issues of inheritance and succession.

Some of the specific problems that emerged from  the  presentations  on  the
implementation of the Domestic Violence Act included:


  *   Inadequate resources being allocated to  the  implementation  of  the
       Act.
  *   Sexual abuse often not seen as abuse.
  *   When SAPS are called, the onus is often placed on women to  say  what
       they want SAPS to do with the perpetrator.
  *   The forms are difficult to complete.

A  detailed   report   entitled   "Strengthening   Women's   Voices   though
Participation: Consultative Conference on engaging Women in  Parliament"  is
available.

5.    Rural workshops

The PPU and the Committee  hosted  capacity  building  workshops  for  rural
women in four provinces during 2001. The provinces were  Mpumalanga,  North-
West, Limpopo and Kwa-Zulu Natal.  These  workshops  constituted  the  pilot
Rural Women's Project.

The objectives of the workshops were to:


  *   Create an understanding amongst rural women about Parliament and  the
       law making process.
  *   Create an understanding of how  to  participate  in  the  legislative
       process.
  *   Obtain submissions on the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act
       and  the  proposals  for  the  proposed  Inheritance  and  Succession
       legislation.

It was evident from the workshops that there is a need for public  education
around the Domestic Violence  Act.  Many  of  the  women  who  attended  the
workshops  thought  that  only  physical   violence   constituted   domestic
violence. It was only  after  the  Act  was  explained  to  them  that  they
understood that there were different types of domestic violence.

Whilst the workshops were a  success,  there  were  incidents  which  nearly
disrupted this  process.  The  incidents  were  discussed  in  the  National
Assembly to make sure that this type  of  incident  does  not  occur  again,
because it may hinder the  performance  of  the  public  representatives  to
cascade the important message to rural women in South Africa.

6.    Committee report  commissioned  from  the  Center  for  the  Study  of
      Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) on  Budgets  and  Violence  Against
      Women.

The Committee  commissioned  the  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Violence  and
Reconciliation to investigate the extent of government financial aid to non-
profit  organisations   (NPOs)   providing   support   services   to   women
experiencing violence.

The aims of the study were to:


  *    Quantify  government  departments'  financial  aid  and  support  to
       organisations providing some kind of support to girls and women  aged
       fifteen years and older who have experienced gender-based violence.


  *   Identify factors enhancing and/or constraining organisations' ability
       to access government funds for this work.


  *   Describe the type  of  activities  for  which  organisations  receive
       government support.

The research findings will be used to assist members  of  the  Parliamentary
Committee to undertake a range of activities aimed at ensuring  that  future
budgets allocate sufficient funds to address the  needs  of  women  who  are
experiencing gender violence.

Recommendations

The Committee, in fulfilment of its oversight role, has  undertaken  several
informative initiatives in respect to violence against  women.  The  reports
resulting from  the  various  initiatives  are  rich  with  information  and
recommendations to various Government Departments. It  is  thus  recommended
that:


  *   Questions emanating from the various forums be posed to the different
       departments with regard to the implementation of the  Act,  resources
       available and budgetary requirements.
  *   The various reports should be disseminated to the various departments
       and they should be asked to formally respond to it.
  *   A huge public education initiative be undertaken by  GCIS  to  ensure
       that the Domestic Violence Act  becomes  more  accessible  to  women,
       especially rural women.
  *   We ensure that the criminal justice system is more gender  sensitive,
       especially in terms of sentencing, sensitivity  of  court  officials,
       and women's access to justice.
  *   More shelters be provided for women who experience domestic violence,
       because women often have to return home to perpetrators of  violence,
       because there is not an adequate number of shelters.
  *   Customary law be  revised,  because  rural  women  still  suffer  the
       effects of customary law.
  *   The rural workshops be continued in the provinces not covered in 2001
       rural workshops and the 2000 provincial visits.
  *   A debate on Domestic Violence be held in the  National  Assembly  and
       the National Council of Provinces.

     We cannot say we are moving faster towards the attainment  of  complete
     liberation from the legacy of the past unless the women of our  country
     live without fear in their houses and walk freely through  the  streets
     and villages of our land." - President Thabo Mbeki

1.    INTRODUCTION


  (a) The Joint Committee on the Improvement of the  Quality  of  Life  and
       Status of Women  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Committee)  was
       permanently established in June 1998 to monitor and oversee  progress
       with regard to the improvement of the quality of life and  status  of
       women in South Africa, with specific reference  to  the  government's
       commitments made at the United National Fourth  World  Conference  on
       Women in Beijing in 1995, and the provisions of  the  United  Nations
       Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination  Against
       Women (CEDAW).


  (b) The South African government's signature and  ratification  of  CEDAW
       created an obligation to introduce  measures  to  protect  the  basic
       rights of women and to improve the status  of  women  by  eliminating
       gender-based discrimination.  CEDAW requires countries to  report  to
       the UN every four years, and South Africa's first progress report was
       submitted to the UN CEDAW Committee in 1997.


  (c) CEDAW defines violence against women  as  "any  act  of  gender-based
       violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual
       or psychological harm or suffering to  women,  including  threats  of
       such acts, coercion or  arbitrary  deprivation  of  liberty,  whether
       occurring in public or in private life."3 It  encompasses  "physical,
       sexual and psychological violence -


       *    occurring in the family, including battering,  sexual  abuse  of
         female children in the household, dowry-related  violence,  marital
         rape, female genital mutilation  and  other  traditional  practices
         harmful to women, non-spousal  violence  and  violence  related  to
         exploitation;


       *    occurring within the general community, including  rape,  sexual
         abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work,  in  educational
         institutions  and  elsewhere,  trafficking  in  women  and   forced
         prostitution;


       *    perpetrated or condoned by the state, wherever it occurs."4


  (d) The Beijing Platform for Action (BPFA) is  a  comprehensive  plan  of
       action to enhance the social, economic and political  empowerment  of
       women, and is premised on the need  for  the  sharing  of  power  and
       responsibility in the home, workplace and  in  wider  society.  South
       African government departments tabled their commitments to  the  BPFA
       in February 1996.


  (e) In his opening address to Parliament on 25 June 1999, President Thabo
       Mbeki's spoke of the "twilight world of  ...  continuous  sexual  and
       physical abuse of women and children". More light has  been  shed  on
       this twilight world during the past year than ever before, mainly due
       to the increased vigilance of the public with the assistance  of  the
       media.


  (f) Interpol: SA has highest reported rape ratio in the  world  Insurance
       Policy.


  (g) The objectives of the November  1999  hearings  on  violence  against
       women were the following:-
       *    to identify what and where the blockages are which impede  women
         who have been victims of all forms of violence, from having  access
         to justice; and


       *    to determine the varied ways in which such obstacles to  justice
         can be addressed and eliminated.


  (h) The hearings were held from 8 to 17 November 1999.  A  full  list  of
       submissions (both written and oral) appears at the end of the report.
       Copies of all written submissions are available  from  the  Committee
       clerk. Other documents referred to in this report are also listed  at
       the end hereof.


  (i) This report will deal with the following aspects of violence  against
       women,  with  special  reference  to  the  submissions  made  at  the
       hearings:


       *    criminal justice;


       *    law enforcement;


       *    welfare services and shelters;


       *    health care;


       *    incarceration of offenders;


       *    recent research on violence against women;


       *    public awareness and education;


       *    allocation of financial resources and the Budget;


       *    inter-ministerial co-operation and co-operative governance;


       *    co-operation between government and civil society;


       *    the need for a statistical database;


       *    recommendations and queries to government departments.

2.    CRIMINAL JUSTICE

New and proposed legislation and its implementation


  (a) CEDAW stipulates that government should "develop penal, civil, labour
       and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation  to  punish  and
       redress the wrongs caused to women who  are  subjected  to  violence;
       women who are subjected to violence should be provided with access to
       the  mechanisms  of  justice  and,  as  provided  for   by   national
       legislation, to just and effective remedies for the  harm  that  they
       have suffered; States should also inform women  of  their  rights  in
       seeking redress through such mechanisms."5


  (b) Significant progress has been  made  in  the  amendment  of  existing
       legislation and the  promulgation  of  new  legislation  relating  to
       violence against women and children. The most important of these are:


       *    the Domestic Violence Act (DVA)6, which comes into operation  on
         15 December 1999 and replaces the  Prevention  of  Family  Violence
         Act7. Difficulties anticipated with the implementation of  the  DVA
         are described elsewhere;


       *    limiting the granting of bail  for  persons  accused  of  having
         committed specified serious offences, which include rape; 8


       *    providing  for  minimum  sentences  for  murder  and  rape  with
         aggravating circumstances.9 Certain difficulties  in  the  judicial
         interpretation of especially the minimum  sentence  amendment  have
         come to light, and will be detailed below.


       *    The South African Law Commission  (SALC)  has  also  produced  a
         Sexual Offences Discussion Paper incorporating  a  proposed  Sexual
         Offences Bill. The most important features of the  proposed  Sexual
         Offences Bill are the following:-


         *  The common law definition of  rape  (a  man  having  intentional
           unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman, without  her  consent)
           restricts the sexual  intercourse  to  the  penetration  of  the
           vagina by the penis, and non-consensual anal or oral penetration
           does not constitute rape or indecent assault in common  law.  In
           proposing the repeal of the common  law  offence  of  rape,  the
           Commission  has  put  forward  a  new  gender-neutral  statutory
           offence,  centring  on  'unlawful  sexual   penetration'   under
           coercive circumstances.


              This definition means that the State will not be  required  to
              prove absence of consent  on  the  part  of  the  victim.  The
              accused can still  raise  consent  to  sexual  intercourse  as
              justification for the unlawful conduct,  but  will  in  future
              have to carry the burden of proof in this regard. Furthermore,
              penetration would include  penetration  to  any  extent  by  a
              penis, object/part of the body of  a  person/animal  into  the
              anus, ear, mouth, nose, vagina/body orifice of an  animal;  or
              body orifice  of  a  person  in  a  manner  simulating  sexual
              intercourse. This means, inter alia, that both men  and  women
              can be rape victims and perpetrators.


              "Under coercive circumstances" include force, threat, abuse of
              authority,  impaired  mental  capacity,  unlawful   detention,
              mistaken identity, mistaken act or if the complainant is under
              12 years of age.


              The proposed legislation also provides that marriage or  other
              relationships does not constitute a defence  to  rape,  and  a
              husband can therefore be convicted of  raping  his  wife.   It
              also provides for retrospective application. Furthermore, rape
              in other laws will be replaced by the new definition.


         *   Similarly,  the  current  position  defines  incest  as  sexual
           intercourse  between  persons  within  prohibited   degrees   of
           relationships.  The   proposed   definition   is   that   sexual
           penetration replaces the term sexual intercourse.


         *  In the proposed legislation, sexual  molestation  constitutes  a
           sexual act with a child of two years and  younger.  It  includes
           committing   a   sexual    act    with    the    intention    of
           inviting/persuading/allowing a child of two years and younger to
           engage in a sexual act. The child's consent does not  constitute
           a defence. A child is defined as someone under  the  age  of  16
           years.


         *  Persistent sexual abuse of a child (two or more occasions  of  a
           sexual/act/penetration with a child within a period of one year)
           will constitute an offence in the proposed legislation.


         *  In the proposed legislation  child  prostitution  constitutes  a
           sexual act with a child (someone under the age of 18 years)  for
           reward, favour and compensation to a child or any other  person.
           It includes inviting, persuading/inducing a child  to  commit  a
           sexual act for reward, favour/compensation.


         *  Keeping a brothel for  child  prostitution:  Keeping  a  brothel
           constitutes   an   offence.   A   brothel    is    defined    as
           movable/immovable property where commercial  exploitation  of  a
           child  occurs.  Keeping  includes:  owning,  leasing,   renting,
           managing, occupying or otherwise having control of a brothel.
         *  Facilitating or allowing commercial  sexual  exploitation:  This
           covers   any   person   who   facilitates   commercial    sexual
           exploitation, including a  parent,  guardian  or  caregiver  who
           allows commercial sexual exploitation.


       *    Provisions not included in the Proposed  Bill  include  cultural
         and religious practices considered harmful  to  children10,  sexual
         harassment11, the criminalisation of harmful  behaviour  of  people
         with HIV and the HIV testing of sexual offenders.


       *    The proposed legislation, and in particular the move  away  from
         without consent to include coercive circumstances is considered  by
         many organisations as very progressive. Women's  organisations,  in
         particular  Rape  Crisis,  have  expressed  support  for  the   new
         definition of rape.
  (c) The SALC is also in the process of producing a  discussion  paper  on
       the procedural aspects of the prosecution of sexual  offences,  which
       will also deal with the evidentiary rules, which operate against  the
       complainant in rape cases. Such evidentiary rules, which are arguably
       based on common assumptions that  women's  evidence  in  rape  trials
       should be treated with caution since women  are  thought  to  lie  in
       sexual offence cases out of jealousy, spite and revenge, include:-


       *    the  cautionary  rule,  in  terms  of  which  certain  types  of
         evidences are treated with caution in a  criminal  trial,  such  as
         where the complainant is the only witness;


       *    evidence of the previous  sexual  history  of  the  complainant,
         which can only be  admitted  with  the  consent  of  the  presiding
         officer on the basis of its relevance.  This  rule  appears  to  be
         based thereon that, if a woman has had sexual intercourse  (whether
         or not such intercourse was with the accused), she is  more  likely
         to have consented to sexual intercourse;


       *    the rule of first report in rape or  sexual  offence  cases,  an
         exception to the general rule that previous  consistent  statements
         are inadmissible, in terms  of  which  the  complainant's  evidence
         that she reported  the  rape  to  another  person  soon  after  the
         alleged offence is admissible. The application of this  rule  often
         leads to the drawing of a negative credibility  conclusion  if  the
         complainant did not report the alleged offence to another person.


  (d) In its June 1998 report on the Violence Against Women  Hearings,  the
       Committee described a submission from the  Centre  for  Violence  and
       Reconciliation detailing the phenomenon of "intimate femicide" -  the
       killing of women by intimate male partners. The  submission  compared
       sentences handed out to men and women who killed  their  spouses  and
       found startling disparities in what appeared  to  be  inappropriately
       light  sentences  for   men   who   murdered   their   partners   and
       inappropriately heavy sentences for women who did  the  same  in  the
       context of  continuous  domestic  violence.  Recommendations  by  the
       Centre included:-


       *    establishing a task team to consider the question of gender bias
         in sentencing;


       *    introducing legislation permitting the introduction  of  similar
         fact evidence or evidence of a history of domestic violence;


       *    abandoning the complete  defence  of  non-pathological  criminal
         incapacity;


       *    early release for women  serving  sentences  for  killing  their
         abusers; and


       *    training of members of the judiciary.


  (e) Specific impediments to the implementation of the DVA was raised in a
       written submission to the Committee by the Gender Advocacy  Programme
       (GAP)13:
       *    Women lack knowledge on their rights to  freedom  from  domestic
         violence, and their specific remedies in terms of the DVA.


       *    The DVA gives magistrates discretion to  determine  whether  the
         respondent is committing  or  has  committed  an  act  of  domestic
         violence, and whether the complainant may suffer undue hardship  as
         a result  of  the  domestic  violence.  This  opens  this  way  for
         prejudices of magistrates to affect the protection  of  women,  and
         to lead to great inconsistency in the application of the DVA.


       *    Allowing legal representation in court will  disadvantage  women
         who do not have the financial means to  solicit  legal  assistance.
         This may also discourage  women  from  applying  for  a  protection
         order, and make the process a lengthy and costly affair.


       *    Clerks of the Court are not trained to fulfil the  role  of  the
         point of entry to the justice system for complainants  of  domestic
         violence.


       *    The DVA places the  burden  of  the  costs  of  service  on  the
         complainant; if she cannot pay, she has to  furnish  the  Clerk  of
         the Court with proof that she is not able to pay.  The  complainant
         will usually also lose time at  work  to  apply  for  a  protection
         order, resulting in a loss of income.


       *    The majority of South African women reside many miles  from  the
         nearest  police  station  or  magistrate's  court,  limiting  their
         access to the remedies provided by the DVA.


       *    Support services such  as  shelters,  financial  support,  legal
         assistance,  police  protection,  access  to  housing,   education,
         training, employment opportunities, psychological services are  all
         required to assist women to transcend the cycle of abuse.


       *    The DVA provides the SAPS with clear roles and  responsibilities
         in   assisting   victims   of   domestic   violence.   Women    are
         understandably critical of  the  services  provided  by  the  SAPS,
         especially in view of past attitudes  to  domestic  violence  as  a
         "family matter" and not a serious offence.


       *    The DVA makes provision for the complainant to receive a  notice
         of her rights in her official language and  to  have  the  contents
         thereof explained to her. Most  police  stations  are  understaffed
         and no more than three official languages are  spoken.  As  far  as
         GAP was aware,  no  additional  personnel  had  been  allocated  to
         stations for the implementation of the DVA, nor had  strategies  to
         address this issue been developed.


  (f) The head of the Family Court also raised the following concerns about
       the implementation of the DVA:


       *    The DVA provided for 13 new forms, for which the printing by the
         Government Printer had  not  yet  commenced  at  the  time  of  the
         hearings.


       *    The DVA provided that an  application  for  a  protection  order
         would be heard after hours only if  the  complainant  would  suffer
         "undue hardship" if the matter was not heard.  Concern  was  raised
         about how this hardship would be determined if the complainant  was
         not given an after hours hearing.


  (g) The Department of Justice made certain general  comments14  regarding
       difficulties with implementation of new legislation:


       *    The consultation process with all roleplayers (some independent)
         is time-consuming.
       *    The delay in implementing new legislation is caused by a lack of
         policy statement and implementation strategy for such  legislation:
         an  implementation  strategy  and  the  funding  thereof  must   be
         discussed from the outset of development of policy and drafting  of
         new legislation.


       *    New policies, legislation and the expectations  created  thereby
         increase the existing case load and need for funding, which  causes
         bad service delivery, which means that, as before, victims  do  not
         approach courts with gender and gender violence disputes.

3.    Functioning of existing courts and establishment of special courts


  (a) Women reported negative experiences of courts  in  general,  and  the
       rate of conviction  of  crimes  of  violence  against  women  remains
       unacceptably  low.  Submissions   complained   about   inexperienced,
       unprofessional and ill-prepared prosecutors, insensitive treatment of
       traumatised witnesses, lack of  facilities  at  courts  and  lack  of
       transport to courts, magistrates' lack of understanding of issues  of
       gender  violence,  clogged-up  court   rolls   15   and   unnecessary
       postponements of matters 16, a shortage of regional  magistrates  and
       more qualified prosecutors, intermediaries and interpreters.17


  (b) The Masimanyane Women's Support Centre reported to the Committee on a
       study on domestic violence and rape using police dockets18 and  court
       files.

Mdantsane Court: 1997 to April 1999

Total number of rape cases in 1997 624
Postponements 368
Struck off the roll (the files did not provide  a  reason,  though  probably
due to insufficient evidence) 100
Warrants for arrest issued 30
Cases withdrawn (not specified whether by state or complainant) 60
Trials 40
Entered in error 20
Finalised 6
Unconditional imprisonment 3
Guilty with sentences between 2 to 9 years3

East London Court: 1997 to April 1999
Total number of rape cases in 1997 793
Postponements 647
Acquittals 40
Moved to another court 25
Sentenced 20
Suspended sentences of four years or more 9
Fines of R2003


  (c) Masimanyane reported that the police expected the social  workers  to
       inform women of their  rights,  while  social  workers  expected  the
       police to do it. One woman who went to the district surgeon was  sent
       back to the police (for which she had  to  find  her  own  transport)
       because they said no medical examination could take place  until  she
       had made a statement (though they could have  called  the  police  to
       come to the hospital).


  (d) Overall, Masimanyane described  a  lack  of  communication,  lack  of
       training and a lack of transport to hospitals  and  police  stations.
       They also reported a reluctance on the part of medical  examiners  to
       appear in court for fear of witnesses being treated with  disrespect.
       Victims often back out of prosecution due to lack of  support.  There
       are reports of women waiting for their court appearance in  the  same
       hallway as her assailants. The victims do not know what is  going  on
       and they are not given any information at all. Examples were cited of
       dockets being lost  and  of  victims  not  being  notified  of  their
       assailant's bail hearing nor of his release on bail.
  (e) UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law and Development  Project
       reported that, based on research undertaken in  rural  areas  in  the
       Southern Cape, women had to wait in the same area as the accused, did
       not have  proper  consultation  with  the  prosecutor  before  trial,
       failure to explain the decision whether  to  prosecute  or  not,  and
       inadequate preparation for the trial.


  (f) The Commission on Gender Equality reported the failure of Sheriffs to
       serve interdicts in informal settlements, demanding service  fees  to
       be paid prior to service, requiring applicants to deliver  interdicts
       themselves, and even the complete  absence  of  sheriff  services  in
       rural areas. The Commission also complained of a lack of follow-up in
       domestic violence cases,  especially  breaches  of  existing  orders,
       decision by  particular  court  to  issue  peace  orders  instead  of
       interdicts to lack  of  sheriff  services  in  rural  areas,  handing
       interdicts to applicants for service  when  applicants  do  not  have
       enough money to pay sheriff's fees.


  (g)  The  Department  of  Justice  told  the  Committee  that  they  were
       finalising a Customer Service Charter  for  Court  Users,  a  Service
       Delivery Improvement  Plan  and  Victims  Rights  Charter,  and  were
       engaged in various information campaigns for court  users,  including
       the Sixteen Days of Activism against Violence Against Women.


  (h) In  the  Department  of  Justice's  1997  report,  it  described  the
       development of a monitoring  system  for  the  Guidelines  on  Sexual
       Offences developed by a national task  team.  This  issue  was  again
       mentioned in the Department's 1998 report. The Committee still  needs
       to know from  the  Department  whether  a  method  of  enforcing  the
       Guidelines have been further investigated and implemented.19


  (i) In the Department's 1998 report, it reported back on a Canadian study
       tour dealing with violence  against  women.  Lessons  from  the  tour
       included an inter-sectoral  approach,  the  economic  empowerment  of
       women, survivor counselling  and  offender  rehabilitation,  and  the
       establishment of shelters and safe houses for victims. The Department
       further stated that the Department would  present  a  report  on  the
       study tour  to  the  NCPS  inter-ministerial  meeting  and  that  the
       Department envisaged the appointment of an inter-sectoral  task  team
       to  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  recommendations.20  The
       Committee requests the Department of Justice to  furnish  it  with  a
       progress report in this regard.


  (j) The Committee  also  intends  establishing  from  the  Department  of
       Justice whether the necessary forms prescribed by the DVA  have  been
       printed and distributed to magistrate's courts across the country.


  (k) The  Department  of  Justice  reported  to  the  Committee21  on  two
       programmes for implementation of specialised courts.
       *    Specialised family courts, already operating as pilot courts  in
         CT, PE, Durban, JHB and LebowaKgomo, handled  inter  alia  domestic
         violence matters, with the Family Advocate, Department  of  Welfare
         and various NGO's working at these centres to provide  counselling,
         mediation and investigation. The Department  of  Justice  indicated
         that it was intended that new Family Courts  would  be  established
         in  Mafikeng,   Nelspruit,   Umtata,   George,   Bloemfontein   and
         Kimberley, with satellite centres  at  Magistrate's  Courts  around
         the main centres.


       *    However, the head of Family Courts reported 22 to the  Committee
         that  there  was  little  infrastructure   and   support   services
         available for the Family Courts,  even  though  they  had  been  in
         existence for six years. The courts  were  badly  underfunded  (for
         example, stationery and photocopiers  were  not  available),  which
         causes  unnecessary  delays,  for  example  in  the   granting   of
         interdicts. There were also no waiting rooms for women.


       *    A serious security problem was also experienced  at  the  Family
         Courts and there were instances of assault on the  premises.  Often
         women were too scared to leave the offices  since  they  knew  that
         the alleged perpetrator would be waiting outside.


       *    There are presently  four  sexual  offences  courts,  which  are
         better placed to deliver higher quality service to the  victims  of
         violence against women and  children.  The  Department  of  Justice
         told the Committee that it  planned  to  roll  out  20  new  Sexual
         Offences Courts in the next two years.


       *    The four existing Sexual Offences Courts  are  all  situated  in
         urban areas, which means that complainants from  rural  areas  have
         to travel long distances to  attend  the  trial.  Due  to  lack  of
         transport, such a complainant may even find  herself  in  the  same
         vehicle as the accused.23 The Department of Justice  reported  that
         20 new Sexual Offences Courts would be established within the  next
         two years. The pilot  project  for  Family  Courts  would  also  be
         expanded to other centres.


       *    The Regional Magistrate's Commission24 presented  the  Committee
         with statistics for the Sexual Offences Court in Wynberg:

Cases       finalised  Guilty     Not guilty
April 1999  15   8     7

May 1999    22   15    7

June 1999   21   12    9


  (l) Two of the permanent magistrates in  the  Sexual  Offences  Court  in
       Wynberg raised the following concerns25 with the Committee:


       *    There is a need to reconsider the adversarial system  in  sexual
         offence cases. Such a system assumes that both parties were  equal,
         while such equality had to be questioned where the one party  is  a
         little girl, and the other an elderly man with a  senior  advocate.
         Much of the outcome  of  a  case  depended  on  the  ability,  wit,
         energy, ruthlessness and even permissible rudeness, which a  cross-
         examiner might display. The selfish and partial manner  with  which
         parties  are  allowed  to  present  evidence   results   often   in
         procedural and formal  truth  being  promoted  at  the  expense  of
         material truth.


       *    There was also a need to re-examine the strict rules of evidence
         applicable  in  sexual  offence  cases,  and  in   particular   the
         cautionary rules of evidence.


       *    There should be a general  rule  that  children  should  testify
         through an intermediary,  and  only  in  exceptional  circumstances
         should there be deviated from this rule.  Consideration  should  be
         given to an amendment to Section 170A  of  the  Criminal  Procedure
         Act to include mentally impaired persons with a mental age of  less
         than eighteen. It was also difficult for magistrates  to  determine
         when a witness would suffer "undue mental stress"  as  is  required
         by Section 170A.


       *    Difficulties have arisen in the interpretation of Section  51(3)
         of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Amendment  Act26  regarding  imposing
         minimum sentences, as well as  the  restrictive  interpretation  of
         Section 158 of the CPA,  which  deals  with  the  circumstances  in
         which a court may depart from the general principle that a  witness
         should give his or evidence in the presence of the accused.


  (m) The Director of Public Prosecutions reported that,  from  1  December
       1999, a special High Court would be convened  in  Mndantsane  in  the
       Eastern Cape to hear only rape cases, which had built up  during  the
       last three years.
4.    Court clerks, interpreters and prosecutors


  (a) Two important functions of clerks of the court were emphasised during
       the hearings: their role as organisers and facilitators of case rolls
       at courts, and their role as primary  assistants  to  applicants  for
       protection orders in terms of the DVA.


       *    The President of the Regional Court for the Western Cape27  told
         the Committee that the organisation of court rolls was one  of  the
         major difficulties faced by Magistrates. A system of  "court  nags"
         has recently been introduced, with the court nag's task  to  ensure
         that cases  set  to  run  will  in  fact  run,  mainly  by  phoning
         witnesses and other role players two weeks prior to the trial  date
         to ensure that all will be available on that day.


       *    The Tswaranang Legal Advocacy Centre  to  End  Violence  Against
         Women28 told the Committee that, since clerks were the first  entry
         point for a woman at court, they  need  to  give  better  technical
         assistance and support. GAP29 also emphasised the need  for  proper
         training of clerks of the court, since the treatment women  receive
         from clerks often result in women not  returning  with  application
         forms for interdicts.


  (b) The lack of experienced prosecutors trained in dealing with crimes of
       violence against women emerged as  a  major  impediment  to  criminal
       justice. Often prosecutors  are  the  survivor's  only  ally  in  the
       criminal justice system, and these prosecutors are  not  equipped  to
       deal sensitively30 with the traumatised complainant or to provide  an
       equal opponent to experienced defence attorneys.


       *    The Tswaranang Legal Advocacy Centre  to  End  Violence  Against
         Women described prosecutors as insensitive to gender violence,  and
         complained of a lack of consultation with the complainant.31
       *    The Masimanyane Women's Support Centre reported on  difficulties
         caused by the high turnover in prosecutors, with prosecutors  going
         on leave, study leave, or transfer to other courts.32


       *    In its submission to the  Committee,  the  UWC's  Community  Law
         Centre reported that prosecutors are ill-prepared because of  large
         workloads and blamed a lack of resources.


       *    The Director of Public Prosecutions reported  to  the  Committee
         that public prosecutors have been told that violence against  women
         is a priority area: the number of  convictions  needs  to  increase
         and instructions have been given to ensure that investigations  are
         completed quickly to  so  that  victims  do  not  forget  parts  of
         evidence and defendants are advantaged  by  the  lapsed  period  of
         time. In addition,  prosecutions  may  only  be  withdrawn  on  the
         authority of the Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions.


       *    The Head of the Sexual Offences Unit and  Community  Affairs  in
         the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  told  the
         Committee that, since the bulk of sexual  offenders  appear  before
         Regional Courts, the  regional  court  prosecutors  require  urgent
         training in the presentation of evidence, in particular  scientific
         evidence,  in  sexual  offence  cases.  Two  training  courses  had
         already been held involving 60  prosecutors,  which  courses  dealt
         with the collection of  evidence,  presentation  of  DNA  evidence,
         cross-examination skills and sensitivity in dealing with  witnesses
         (including the framing of age-appropriate questions).


       *    In this regard, the Sexual  Offences  Unit  had  met  the  Child
         Protection Units in all provinces to get them  to  co-operate  with
         prosecutors, and also found that the training  of  prosecutors  and
         investigators together was very beneficial. It  was  also  proposed
         that a coalition should be formed between NGO's and the police  and
         prosecutors  to  provide   counsellors   and   intermediaries   for
         traumatised witnesses.


       *    The Department of Justice reported to the  Committee  that  they
         were in the process of establishing  pre-trial  services  to  alert
         prosecutors and magistrates to previous convictions and arrests  of
         offenders.


  (c) The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape also reported
       a real  need  for  more  qualified  prosecutors,  intermediaries  and
       interpreters.

5.    Magistrates


  (a) During the course  of  the  hearings  it  became  apparent  that  the
       Regional Courts, which heard 95% of all rape cases as  the  court  of
       first instance, should be the focus of emergency reform.


  (b) The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape reported  the
       following difficulties in her submission to the Committee:


       *    There was currently a backlog of 7 000  cases  in  the  regional
         courts in the Western Cape. The  present  delay  between  complaint
         and trial was approximately 9 months.


       *    There were only ten permanent seats of the regional court in the
         Western Cape, with satellite courts in  the  rural  areas  such  as
         Malmesbury, Springbok, Calvinia, Vredenburg, Vredendal.


       *    The four sexual offences  courts  were  all  situated  in  urban
         areas, which often means  that  very  young  complainants  have  to
         travel long distances to give evidence. Due to lack  of  transport,
         such a complainant may even find herself in  the  same  vehicle  as
         the accused.


       *    There is severe shortage of regional  magistrates,  and  it  was
         recommended that provision should be made  for  acting  magistrates
         to be employed. It  was  also  mentioned  that  it  was  a  serious
         psychological health hazard  for  prosecutors  and  magistrates  to
         adjudicate in sexual offences  courts  for  lengthy,  uninterrupted
         periods of time.


  (c) The National Network on Violence Against Women complained  that  many
       judicial  officials  have  little  or  no  understanding  of   gender
       violence, the rape trauma syndrome or  the  battered  wife  syndrome,
       which is evidenced by their negative attitudes directed at  survivors
       of  these  crimes.  Various  submissions,  including  that   of   the
       Tswaranang Legal Advocacy Centre to end Violence  Against  Women  and
       Ilitha Labantu  argued  that  both  magistrates  and  judges  require
       training on the non-legal aspects of rape.


  (d) The Chief Director of Justice College reported to  the  Committee  on
       the training of regional and district court magistrates, as  well  as
       prosecutors  on  sexual  offences,  child  law,  domestic   violence,
       violence against women (a pilot training project), basic human rights
       and  social  context  training.  The  Justice  College   receives   a
       significant amount in donor funding in addition to its own budget.

6.    The judiciary


  (a) The Committee  has  on  various  occasions  expressed  concern  about
       inappropriate statements made by High Court judges and  what  appears
       to be inappropriately light sentences handed down  in  judgements  in
       cases of rape and other violence  against  women  33.  To  date,  the
       Committee's efforts to engage in discussion  with  the  judiciary  on
       issues of violence against women has been hampered by  incorrect  and
       sensationalist media reporting. However, the Committee remains of the
       view that such discussion could be beneficial to both  the  Committee
       and the judiciary.


  (b) Many of the submissions expressed concern about  statements  made  in
       recent judgements of High Court judges in cases of  rape,  especially
       in the context of the minimum  sentence  amendment  to  the  Criminal
       Procedure Act34. Numerous calls were made for the education of judges
       on issues relating to discrimination and violence against women.  For
       example, concern was expressed about views  on  women  taken  by  the
       judiciary which reveal a reliance on stereotypes  and  which  suggest
       that women collaborate in crimes against them.35


  (c) This issue came to the fore  in  the  interpretation  of  the  recent
       amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act dealing with  the  imposition
       of a minimum sentence of life imprisonment where the victim is  under
       the age of 16, is raped more than once, is raped  by  more  than  one
       person where such person is acting with a common  purpose,  or  where
       the rape involves the infliction of grievous bodily harm, save  where
       the   court   is   satisfied   that   "substantial   and   compelling
       circumstances" exist which would justify a less severe  sentence.  It
       is the judicial interpretation of  this  exception,  which  has  come
       under scrutiny by women's organisations and the media.


  (d) The Committee was furnished with a submission by the UWC's  Community
       Law Centre's Gender Project36 which examines  disparities  in  recent
       cases.


       *    In the case of S v Zitha37, a six-year-old girl was raped in her
         home by three men who had entered the house (armed  with  a  panga)
         for purposes of robbery. Despite the girl's pleas  that  they  take
         whatever they want but just leave her alone, the  three  men  raped
         her in turn on her own bed, one  of  them  raping  her  twice.  All
         three men were convicted of rape.
           During sentence proceedings, it was  argued  on  behalf  of  the
           accused that the youth of the three men (they were 20, 19 and 18
           at the time of the commission  of  the  offence)  constituted  a
           substantial and compelling circumstance,  along  with  the  fact
           that none had any previous convictions and all  three  had  come
           from  unfortunate  backgrounds.  More  astonishingly,   it   was
           advanced on behalf of the accused that the little girl  had  not
           suffered any serious injury apart from the  rape  and  that  the
           rape had not been premeditated since the men had gone  into  the
           house in order to commit a robbery.


           Goldstein J held that even if the rape had not been  planned  in
           advance, it was no simple act -  it  "constituted  a  series  of
           horrific invasions of the sanctity of the  complainant's  body".
           He also rejected the argument that the accused's youth and clean
           record  could  be  seen  as   a   substantial   and   compelling
           circumstance, and held that it was the  duty  of  the  court  to
           impose a sentence of life imprisonment for the offence of rape.


       *    In the case of S v Segole38, a 24-year-old woman was abducted at
         gunpoint by two men. She was driven to a deserted farm,  robbed  of
         her jewellery and valuables and then ordered into  a  the  deserted
         ruin of a house, where both men  raped  her.  Afterwards,  she  was
         tied up and left there. She managed to escape from the  house,  and
         reached safety by stumbling through mud and  swamps  to  a  factory
         nearby.


           It was advanced on behalf of the accused  that  the  complainant
           had not suffered any serious physical injury nor had she  to  be
           treated in hospital. It was even argued that she exaggerated the
           severity of the injuries and that the psychological  trauma  was
           not severe. It was further argued that both accused were from  a
           deprived background.


           Jordaan  AJ  quite  correctly   took   the   evidence   of   the
           psychological  trauma   experienced   by   the   survivor   into
           consideration and stated that  he  could  not  "disregard  these
           factors". He also stated that no weight could be attached to the
           fact that the accused were  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds  as
           they had not gained anything by raping  the  woman.  They  could
           simply have robbed her and taken her vehicle - yet they chose to
           humiliate and degrade her. In conclusion it was stated that "the
           circumstances  of   this   case   do   not   create   compelling
           circumstances envisaged by Parliament."


       *    In the case of S v Shongwe39, a nine-year-old girl was raped  in
         her  home  by  the  father  of  her  mother's  boyfriend.  He   was
         interrupted when someone entered the house.  The  district  surgeon
         who examined the girl stated that her injuries were slight in  that
         there were two slight vaginal tears, which appeared superficial.


           Cillie J felt that  any  person  with  practical  experience  in
           criminal cases and sentencing would regard a  sentence  of  life
           imprisonment on the  accused  in  this  case  as  "shocking".  e
           interpreted the section of the  Act  to  mean  that  wherever  a
           judicial officer is of the view that the  sentence  which  would
           have been imposed prior to the Act and the one required in terms
           of the new Act are so different that it leads to  an  injustice,
           then a departure from the Act would be justified. The court held
           that the non-serious nature of the offence and the lack of  real
           harm to the child were sufficient grounds for departing from the
           mandatory sentence requirement.


           This decision needs to be compared with  the  decision  of  S  v
           Mofokeng 40 the court comes to exactly the opposite  conclusion.
           Here it  was  held  by  Stegmann  J  that  for  substantial  and
           compelling  circumstances  to  be  present  the  facts  of   the
           particular case  must  present  some  circumstance  that  is  so
           exceptional in its nature and  that  so  obviously  exposes  the
           injustice of the statutorily prescribed  sentence  that  it  can
           rightly be described as "compelling".


           The decision in Shongwe is patently wrong,  and  results  in  an
           emasculation of the new legislation. It in  no  way  takes  into
           account  the  purpose  of  the  legislation  or   the   ordinary
           grammatical meaning of the  words  "substantial  and  compelling
           circumstances" as opposed to the words "any  other  circumstance
           which in the opinion of the court should be considered."


       *    In S v Mahamotsa41, two women under the age of 16 were raped  on
         separate occasions by a 23-year-old man. Both were raped more  than
         once by the accused, who had apparently taken them to his house  by
         means of a weapon or something resembling a weapon (the  sentencing
         judgment is not very clear in this regard).  The  second  rape  was
         committed after  the  accused  had  been  arrested  for  the  first
         incident and released in the care of his guardian.


           Kotze J firstly listed a number  of  mitigating  factors,  which
           included the fact that  the  complainants  did  not  lose  their
           virginity as a result of the incidents. They  had  already  been
           sexually active, and "one of them, although only at school,  had
           sexual intercourse with  another  person  two  days  before  the
           incident" (our translation  from  the  Afrikaans  original).  In
           addition,  the  complainants  had  not  sustained  any  physical
           injuries or psychological harm.
           The  court  then  held  that   the   following   constituted   a
           "substantial and compelling circumstance":
              "Although there was intercourse  with  each  complainant  more
              than once, this was the result of the virility of a young  man
              still at school who had intercourse with other  school  pupils
              against  their  wishes,  and,  note,  school  pupils  who  had
              previously been sexually active ... Where one is dealing  with
              school pupils, and where, in addition, it appears that the two
              girls concerned had already had intercourse before, one really
              shouldn't lose perspective, especially not in relation to  the
              first count, which dealt with a complainant  who  had  in  any
              event been naughty a few days earlier and had intercourse with
              someone else. The injustice which she suffered  in  this  case
              does not demand an unusually  severe  sentence."  [Translation
              from Afrikaans original.]
           This judgment has a  chilling  effect,  both  in  terms  of  its
           general approach and its conclusion regarding  "substantial  and
           compelling circumstances". In his interpretation of the Act  and
           the phrase "substantial and compelling circumstances",  Kotze  J
           perpetuates the very myths surrounding rape that one would  have
           hoped to  see  our  courts  discarding,  i.e.  that  rape  isn't
           traumatic for a woman unless there are physical scars and injury
           to show for it, that there  are  no  psychological  consequences
           where a woman has been sexually active prior  to  the  rape  and
           that so-called "rape" is often merely a matter of  misunderstood
           male virility.


       *    In its submission to the Committee,  the  Community  Law  Centre
         expressed the view that, in the consideration by judges of what  is
         "substantial and compelling circumstances", the  following  factors
         should not be taken into account:-
         *  whether the complainant has been sexually active;
         *  whether the complainant and  accused  know  each  other  or  are
           related; and
         *   whether  any  real  physical  injury  was  sustained   by   the
           complainant.

7.    Appeals from the Regional Court and the Sexual Offences Courts


  (a) The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape  reported  to
       the Committee that, from 11 February 1997 till the present, about 850
       matters were finalised in the  Sexual  Offences  courts  in  Wynberg.
       There were only about 40-45 appeals against convictions of which only
       14 were successful.


  (b) Concern was expressed about a recent increase in the setting aside of
       convictions and the reduction of sentences on appeal,  especially  in
       view of the fact that magistrates had the best opportunity to  assess
       a witness's performance, an advantage a  presiding  judge  on  appeal
       does not have. The President of the Regional  Court  in  the  Western
       Cape indicated that  they  were  particularly  concerned  about  such
       appeals being granted by acting judges.
  (c) The Director of Public  Prosecutions  also  expressed  concern  about
       lenient  sentences  being  handed  down  in  matters  where   minimum
       sentences were applicable, and indicated that his office were in  the
       process of taking various of these judgements on appeal.

8.    Appointment of judges and disciplinary proceedings


  (a) The chairperson of the Parliamentary Justice Committee and member  of
       the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), Advocate Johnny de Lange, made
       a submission to the Committee regarding the  JSC's  approach  to  the
       appointment of judges. The submission dealt, inter alia, with:-


       *    The JSC, as the body charged with advising the President on  the
         appointment of judges, constituted in terms of Section 178  of  the
         Constitution:   the   Chief   Justice,   the   President   of   the
         Constitutional Court, a designated  Judge  President,  the  Cabinet
         member  responsible  for  the  administration   of   justice,   two
         practising advocates and two practising  attorneys  nominated  from
         their  respective  professions  appointed  by  the  President,  one
         designated university teacher of law, six members of  the  National
         Assembly, of which three must  be  from  opposition  parties,  four
         permanent delegates to the National Council of Provinces  and  four
         persons designated by the President.


       *    The South African  judiciary  is  composed  as  follows  (as  in
         November 1999):

Number of permanent judges in 13 divisions (including  Land  Claims  Courts,
but excluding Labour Courts) 194
Women judges10
Black judges (29 have been appointed since 1994)30
Black judges who are heads of divisions (Chief Justice of Supreme  Court  of
Appeal, Judge President of High Court in Transkei and President of the  Land
Claims Court)3
       *    UWC's Community Law Centre pointed out in their submission  that
         a demographically representative judiciary does not guarantee  race
         and gender sensitivity. The ideal  is  that  every  person  on  the
         bench must be sensitive to race and gender issues, irrespective  of
         their own race and gender.


       *     The  Chief  Justice  has  formulated  the  criteria   for   the
         appointment of judges as follows42:


         *  Is the applicant an appropriately qualified person?


         *  Is she or he a fit and proper person?


         *  Would her or his appointment help  to  reflect  the  racial  and
           gender composition of South Africa?


         *  Is the proposed appointee a person of integrity?


         *  Is the proposed appointee a person  with  the  necessary  energy
           and motivation?


         *  Is the proposed appointee both technically  competent  and  able
           to give expression to the values of the Constitution?


         *  Has the proposed appointee the appropriate potential?
         *  What message is given to the community at large by a  particular
           appointment?


  (b) It  is  apparent  from  the  aforesaid  that  there  is  no  specific
       requirement for knowledge on and sensitivity to  issues  relating  to
       women and violence against women.
  (c) The President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape expressed the
       view to the Committee that judges were mostly drawn from  a  pool  of
       senior  advocates,  usually  men,  whose  experience  was  mainly  in
       commercial matters, and if they do have criminal experience,  it  was
       as an accused-orientated defence counsel.  They  were  therefore  not
       necessarily well-equipped to hear criminal trials and appeals.


  (d) The Commission on Gender Equality reported to the Committee  that  it
       was investigating the possibility of incorporating CGE into  the  JSC
       to ensure the appointment of a more gender-sensitive judiciary.


  (e) The Minister of Justice advised the Committee that draft  legislation
       on  disciplinary  and  grievance  proceedings  for  judges  had  been
       finalised and is presently being circulated among the judiciary.

9.    Education of judges
  (a) Both the Department of Justice and  the  Chief  Director  of  Justice
       College  reported  that  High  Court  judges  resisted   efforts   to
       participate in training on the basis that it may compromise  judicial
       independence. However, the Department has in the past reported on its
       Canadian Justice  Linkage  Project,  a  five-year  judicial  training
       programme that includes higher court judicial officers.43


  (b) Constitutional Court Judge Kate O'Regan presented  a  report  to  the
       Committee  on  her  attendance  at  a  judicial  colloquium  on   the
       application of international human rights law at the domestic  level.
       The communiquÿ adopted by the colloquium raised the following issues:


       *    the need for countries to seek ways to ensure access  for  women
         to the justice system;


       *     the  need  for  lawyers,  legislators,  judges  &  citizens  to
         recognize the importance of and be familiar with international  and
         regional human rights law;


       *    judicial education: calling "for all judges to engage in an  on-
         going process of  comprehensive,  in-depth  and  credible  judicial
         education to integrate CEDAW, CRC  and  other  international  human
         rights  instruments  into  domestic  law  and  decision-making   to
         enhance the  social,  political  and  economic  lives  of  women  &
         children  and  to  eradicate  violence  against  them",  and   "for
         Governments to support the judiciary in  these  efforts,  including
         through the provision of adequate resources";


       *    education for lawyers and citizens on human rights;


       *    the establishment of an international judicial education  centre
         "to assist countries in the design,  development  and  delivery  of
         judicial  education  programmes  on  international   human   rights
         instruments  and  jurisprudence",  as  well  as  "an  international
         resource  centre  to  advise  and   assist   law-makers,   judicial
         officers, prosecutors and lawyers in developing specific  practices
         and processes required to  implement  and  integrate  international
         human rights instruments into their domestic legal systems".

10.   LAW ENFORCEMENT

Previous commitments and recommendations


  (a) In its White Paper on Safety and Security in 1998, the Department  of
       Safety and Security stated that service delivery is a key aspect  for
       women who have often faced secondary victimisation from the  SAPS  in
       the past. To give effect to various victim's  rights  (including  the
       right to be treated with respect and  dignity,  the  right  to  legal
       advice and the right to protection), "specific guidelines for use  at
       station level should be developed to ensure that in  cases  in  which
       women have been victims of sexual offences, rape or domestic violence
       they are treated with extra dignity, compassion and care". The  White
       Paper further stated that these aspects would be  developed  in  line
       with the existing initiatives of  the  Victim  Empowerment  Programme
       (VEP) under the National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS).44


  (b) In its November 1998 report on Government's Implementation  of  CEDAW
       and the BPA, the Committee recorded that it had received no  response
       from either the Minister of Safety and Security  or  the  Independent
       Complaints Directorate (ICD) to its May 1998  letters  requesting  an
       update on programmes to combat violence  against  women,  details  of
       budgetary allocations for implementation of such programmes  and  the
       implementation by the SAPS of certain  recommendations  made  by  the
       ICD.


  (c) In the 1998 report of the ICD45 on the conduct of members of the SAPS
       made, inter alia, the following recommendations46:


       *    The SAPS should embark on an extensive training programme, aimed
         at  improving  the  member's  understanding  of  the   nature   and
         consequences of violence against women, the  context  within  which
         such violence  occurs  and  is  aimed  at  enhancing  the  member's
         capacity to respond appropriately to such complaints.


       *    Suitably trained officers should  be  attached  to  each  police
         station. Complainants should be offered  a  choice  of  a  male  or
         female  member  to  assist   in   the   initial   stages   of   the
         investigation.


       *    Each police station should have a  list  of  organisations  that
         deal with violence against women.


       *    The SAPS should review its mechanisms regarding the  release  of
         information to the media so as not to  discriminate  against  women
         and not to invade their privacy.


  (d) The Committee urgently requires a response from the SAPS and the  ICD
       as to whether any of the above recommendations have been implemented.

11.   Present experiences of the SAPS


  (a) Numerous submissions to the Committee indicated that the SAPS remains
       inaccessible, insensitive47 and ineffective48 in preventing  violence
       against women and assisting victims of violence,  thereby  decreasing
       the  reporting  of  the  crime  and  prosecution  of  attackers.  The
       difficulties can roughly be categorised as problems of  attitude  and
       abuse and operational problems.

12.   Attitudes and abuse


  (a) Submissions described police as accusatory (Why did you go with him";
       "You should not walk in that area alone"; "You know what  happens  at
       the shebeens, you  shouldn't  have  been  there"),  hostile  ("you're
       wasting my time ... come back when  you  get  your  story  straight";
       "what do you want us to do about it?"; "why did you wash  yourself?")
       and uncooperative ("find him and then come back to  us";  "sit  there
       until a female officer arrives to help you")49.


  (b) Police were accused of trying to dissuade women from  laying  charges
       against perpetrators by stressing negative outcomes/consequences  for
       women if they insist on the arrest of the offender.50


  (c) Women also complained of poor police service  in  cases  of  domestic
       violence, and two thirds of those who had  gone  to  the  police  had
       difficulty in convincing  the  police  that  they  were  in  need  of
       protection or were not treated seriously: in  80%  of  cases,  police
       arrived hours later or the next day when called to the scene; 34%  of
       women were told to "stop wasting police time", 26%  were  accused  of
       provoking the violence, 39% were accused of lying; 74% were  expected
       to give statements in not their first language; 43%  were  told  that
       charges could not be laid due to lack of evidence; police also failed
       to inform women on procedure, to update them, or to  investigate  the
       complaint properly; 55% of complainants  were  told  to  "find  their
       attacker" before the police would arrest him.51


  (d) The Commission on Gender Equality complained of the SAPS's failure to
       take complainants seriously, even ridiculing complainants, failure to
       provide sanctuary to complainants, failure to  attempt  to  apprehend
       abusers where warrants have been issued, and demanding that survivors
       accompany police to point out perpetrators.


  (e) Police, on the other hand, complained of women  withdrawing  charges,
       lack  of  resources  &  transport,  non-cooperation  of  victims   in
       investigations, "false complaints", and  laws  which  limit  police's
       right to enter the respondent's home.


  (f) Various allegations were also made about sexual  advances  by  police
       officers.52 It was also reported to the Committee that many policemen
       are vulnerable to bribery by offenders53,  resulting  in  case  files
       going  missing,  thus  hampering  the  investigation  and  ultimately
       justice.54


  (g) It is a requirement of CEDAW that government should take measures  to
       ensure that law enforcement officers receive  training  to  sensitise
       them to the needs of women.55


  (h) The National Network on Violence Against Women reported  that,  while
       it is recognised that training will  facilitate  the  development  of
       more humane treatment of women by police and other officials, gender-
       sensitive training has in the past not resulted  in  gender-sensitive
       practices in the police workplace. There is thus a need  to  evaluate
       the outcome of training, and its application in the workplace.


  (i) Tswaranang Legal Advocacy Centre to End Violence Against  Women  made
       the point that the mainly military training of police does not  equip
       them to deal sensitively with issues of violence against women.


  (j) In a written submission, the National Police Commissioner advised the
       Committee that a training  programme  had  been  developed  to  equip
       members with basic knowledge and skills in this  area  and  all  SAPS
       members would be trained in this over the next two years.


  (k) The Department of Safety and Security reported56 to the Committee the
       following efforts to address crimes against women and children:-
       *    the SAPS has  declared  crimes  against  women  and  children  a
         policing priority for the third consecutive year;


       *    a "national instruction" has been  issued  with  regard  to  the
         support  of  sexual   offences   and   crucial   aspects   of   the
         investigation  thereof.  A   video-recording   of   this   national
         instruction was made and distribute countrywide;
       *    basic training,  detective  training  and  specialised  training
         courses (on, for example, the  investigation  of  sexual  offences,
         family violence and child protection) are in place for  members  of
         the SAPS, with special attention to dealing with women survivors;


       *    the SAPS is represented at Interpol's Standing Working Party  on
         Offences Against Minors.

13.   Operational problems
  (a) There still appears to be a gross discrepancy in the distribution  of
       police  stations  in  historically  disadvantaged   areas,   and   in
       particular, in rural areas. It was reported  to  the  Committee  that
       permanent police stations feature in only 14% of  historically  black
       areas and in 86%  of  historically  white  areas.  The  main  service
       providers in black areas are satellite stations and contact points.57
        The majority of South African  women  reside  many  miles  from  the
       nearest police station or magistrate's court, limiting  their  access
       to justice.


  (b) It was reported that policemen refuse to respond to calls by women by
       saying that they do not have vehicles to come to the complainant.58


  (c) The National Network on Violence Against Women submitted  that  there
       are too few female police officers to counsel survivors of  violence,
       and that they received repeated requests by women for counselling  by
       female officers.


  (d) Women described such difficult experiences as waiting  for  hours  at
       the police station, having to repeat their story to various different
       police officers, not having statements taken in their first language,
       and poor follow-up about arrests, detention or bail hearings  of  the
       accused.59


  (e) The Office of the DPP emphasised that police need to  be  trained  on
       the techniques of collecting DNA  evidence  and  its  preservation.60
       They need training on  how  to  deal  with  traumatised  victims  and
       children when asking questions particularly as  most  rapes  are  not
       committed by strangers but by those close to  the  victims,  such  as
       relatives.


  (f) The Police Commissioner also told the Committee that police  stations
       are in the process of  becoming  more  victim-friendly  and  that  R1
       million had been allocated for rape victim care  packages  containing
       basic toiletries.


  (g) Concern was also expressed  about  the  SAPS's  compliance  with  the
       Domestic Violence Act, which comes  into  operation  on  15  December
       1999.61  By  way  of  example,  the  DVA  makes  provision  for   the
       complainant to receive  a  notice  of  her  rights  in  her  official
       language and to have the contents  thereof  explained  to  her.  Most
       police stations are understaffed and  no  more  than  three  official
       languages are spoken. It did not appear as  if  additional  personnel
       had been allocated to stations for the implementation of the DVA, nor
       had strategies to address this issue been developed.


  (h) The National Police Commissioner  advised  the  Committee  that  SAPS
       national instructions have  been  compiled  in  preparation  for  the
       implementation of the DVA and that all SAPS members must  be  trained
       in terms of these instructions.


  (i) The Department of Safety and Security also reported to the  Committee
       the efforts of the SAPS to transform its  existing  Child  Protection
       Units into specialised Family Violence, Child Protection  and  Sexual
       Offences Units.


       *    These FCS units are  responsible  for  policing  the  crimes  of
         assault  with  the  intention  to  do  grievous  bodily  harm   and
         attempted murder of a victim older than 18 years  where  the  crime
         is committed in the context  of  a  family.  The  units  also  have
         jurisdiction over sexual offences  (where  the  victim  is  18  and
         older) including rape, indecent assault, incest  and  violation  of
         the Sexual Offences Act62 with regard to  the  sexual  exploitation
         of adults. The  FCS  units  are  also  responsible  to  police  the
         following crimes where the victim is under the  age  of  18:  rape,
         indecent assault, sodomy, incest, attempted  murder,  assault  with
         the intention to do grievous bodily  harm,  common  assault  (where
         three or  more  incidents  occur  in  the  context  of  a  family),
         kidnapping, abduction, violation of the Sexual  Offences  Act  with
         regard to the sexual  exploitation  of  children,  the  Child  Care
         Act63 and  the  Films  and  Publication  Act64  relating  to  child
         pornography.


       *    Fourteen of these FCS units are already operational.  There  are
         27 Child Protection Units and four Indecent  Crime  Units  situated
         in the main centres, while specialised  SAPS  members  attached  to
         the Detective Service operate in 156  smaller  centres  across  the
         country. Where no such special unit or individual  is  operational,
         members at the local detective service  or  police  station  police
         the crimes.


       *    Members of the FCS units receive a three  week  training  course
         presented  by  experts  including  psychologists,   criminologists,
         advocates, medical practitioners and senior police officers.


  (j) The following issues still has to be addressed by the  Department  of
       Safety and Security:-


       *    the development of a profile of rape survivors and perpetrators;


       *     disciplinary  action  against  members  of  the  SAPS  who  are
         themselves perpetrators of violence against women;


       *     the  technical  aptitude  of  investigating  officers  in   the
         investigation of charges  of  violence  against  women,  especially
         rape;


       *    the establishment  of  specialised  units  for  rape  and  other
         violence against women and children; and


       *    the  Department's  participation  in  trauma  centres  for  rape
         survivors.

14.   ELFARE SERVICES AND SHELTERS


  (a) The February 1996 Beijing Cabinet commitments  relating  to  violence
       against women include:-


       *    the provision of  shelters  and  relief  support  to  women  and
         girls65;


       *    increasing the understanding of policymakers and implementers of
         the impact of violence on women and girls; and


       *    encouraging the media to present positive images of women.

15.   Counselling and shelters


  (a)  Participants  in  the  hearings  reported  an  absence   of   proper
       counselling for women who are survivors of violence. It appeared that
       officials and professionals  were  not  adequately  trained  to  give
       meaningful assistance to survivors of violence. It was also  reported
       to the Committee that young women face additional difficulties, since
       schools are reluctant to deal with sexual assault and see rape  as  a
       "police issue" while families tend to "hide" the problem.66


  (b) NGO's and CBO's also reported a severe lack of temporary safe housing
       for women as a means of  escaping  situations  of  violence.67   This
       Commission for Gender Equality called for the urgent establishment of
       shelters in especially rural areas.


  (c) Nisaa reported to the Committee that, at present, most  shelters  are
       funded  by  overseas  donor  agencies.  They  submitted  that  it  is
       imperative that South African shelters begin to find local funding in
       the interest of  sustainability.  Since  many  NGO's  have  developed
       considerable expertise in running shelters, Nisaa is of the view that
       NGO's should run the services with government funding, and NGO's thus
       being accountable to government.


  (d) The University of Cape Town's Institute of Criminology's Gender,  Law
       and Development Project presented a submission on research undertaken
       in rural areas in the Southern Cape, and drew the following  findings
       to the committee's attention:


       *    participants reported fear of retaliation,  public  humiliation,
         ostracism by family and friends and little faith in the police  and
         courts.


       *     women  reported  little  or  no  support  from  family  or  the
         community; women were often  too  scared  of  retaliation  to  help
         other women,  family  members  blamed  the  victim  for  not  being
         obedient enough, with further retaliation from the abuser  who  has
         now been humiliated before his family.


       *    Participants  reported  little  or  no  assistance  from  social
         workers from local  welfare  agencies,  namely  the  Department  of
         Welfare and  the  Christelike  Maatskaplike  Raad  (both  of  which
         prioritised child abuse): women expressed a strong  need  for  more
         and better domestic violence counselling and shelters.


  (e) The Gender Advocacy Project (GAP) stated in their written  submission
       to the Committee that support services such  as  shelters,  financial
       support, legal assistance,  police  protection,  access  to  housing,
       education, training, employment opportunities, psychological services
       were essential to assist women to transcend the cycle of abuse.


  (f) The Welfare Ministry reported  to  the  Committee  on  the  following
       achievements and proposed projects:-


       *    A service directory for police and other professionals has  been
         developed.
       *    One-stop service" shelters were being  planned.  The  Department
         intends piloting these shelters in under-resourced provinces.


       *    the Department had embarked on training of SAPS  and  Department
         of Justice officials on the provisions  of  the  DVA.  Training  of
         social workers and volunteers would take place in  January/February
         2000.


       *    the Department  was  planning  public  education  and  awareness
         campaigns on the DVA, and was also  in  the  process  of  informing
         provincial Welfare Departments.


       *    the Victim Empowerment Programme (VEP), a key programme  of  the
         inter-ministerial National Crime Prevention  Strategy  (NCPS),  has
         been launched and R6 million allocated to the  VEP.  Provinces  and
         projects responsive to needs of women and  girls  receive  priority
         in the allocation of funds.  42  service  centres  for  victims  of
         violence were already operational and had  been  allocated  funding
         of R2,25 million. The funding  of  nine  outreach  centres  in  the
         provinces is detailed below.


  (g) In the White Paper on Social Welfare of 1997 guidelines for  strategy
       include strategies to counteract all  forms  of  abuse  and  violence
       against women, support services for women  who  have  been  battered,
       raped  and  sexually  abused,  the  training  of   police   officers,
       magistrates and criminal  justice  personnel  in  the  management  of
       violence against women, gender sensitive welfare services and  taking
       into account women's needs as care givers.


  (h) The Department of Welfare indicated to  the  Committee  in  its  1998
       progress report that it was encouraging the media to present positive
       images of women through a "white ribbon campaign" and  the  "taxi-net
       campaign".68


  (i) The Department of Justice reported  to  the  Committee  that  it  has
       established a 24 hour helpline for abused women.


  (j) The following issues remain to be  addressed  by  the  Department  of
       Welfare:


       *     the  Department's  efforts  to  ensure  that  women   are   not
         discriminated against with regard to welfare  grants  and  properly
         regarded as main care provider, in particular in  situations  where
         the husband is alive but absent or unemployed;
       *    the Department's efforts to ensure the allocation of more  funds
         to care dependency grants for seriously impaired children.

16.   Transport


  (a)  Various  submissions  described  the  difficulties  experienced   by
       especially rural women in accessing health care  and  legal  services
       due to in accessibility of transport.


  (b) UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law  &  Development  Project
       reported69 to the Committee that, in a study  conducted  among  rural
       women in the Southern Cape, almost 35% of women  travel  to  or  from
       work in the dark in rural areas.  It  was  also  found  that  54%  of
       historically disadvantaged groups walk to and from work on foot.


  (c) The Department of Transport was not requested  by  the  Committee  to
       participate in the hearings. The  Committee  intends  requesting  the
       Department to furnish it with its formal response  to  the  following
       issues70, with reference to its White  Paper  on  National  Transport
       Policy of 1996:-


       *     the  Department's  efforts  to  make  public   transport   more
         accessible and affordable to women, who rely on these services  for
         access to justice and health care services;
       *    the Department's efforts to improve  transport  within  villages
         and towns, as well as transport to and from rural areas;


       *    the Department's efforts to ensure the safety of  women  on  the
         public  transport  system,  with  particular  reference   to   more
         conductors and alarm cords on trains, safe waiting places at  train
         stations  and  special  measures  for  transport   services   after
         standard commuter times.

17.   HEALTH CARE

Medico-legal examinations
  (a)  Various  submissions  to  the  Committee   reported   on   practical
       difficulties experienced with the required  medico-legal  examination
       of the victims of sexual assault and rape:


       *    health care  services  are  disproportionately  concentrated  in
         historically white and urban centres.  Most  district  surgeons  in
         the rural areas work part-time,  combining  their  official  duties
         with private practice.71


       *    concomitant lack of access,  mainly  transport,  especially  for
         rural women. UCT's  Institute  of  Criminology's  Gender,  Law  and
         Development  Project  reported  that  rural  women  were   severely
         affected by the lack of operational telephones, long  distances  to
         travel to police stations (which are often inaccessible and  poorly
         resourced) and to clinics and hospitals.72 Police are  supposed  to
         transport women to district surgeons, but seldom do so,  partly  as
         a result of shortage of police vehicles.73


       *    lengthy waiting periods74 between reporting  the  crime  to  the
         police and the medical examination, which not  only  compounds  the
         victim's trauma,  but  is  also  a  deterrent  to  proceeding  with
         criminal charges. One research report showed  that  only  54,8%  of
         survivors  were  examined  within  3  hours  of  reporting  to  the
         police.75


       *    lack of privacy during the medical examination and a failure  on
         the part of district  surgeons  to  explain  the  reasons  for  and
         nature of the examination, often due to linguistic problems;76


       *    inadequate treatment for conditions such as HIV/AIDS, STD's  and
         pregnancy,  or  treatment  without   even   the   most   basic   of
         explanations of the health risks faced  by  rape  survivors.  Often
         the necessary treatment, such as post-exposure prophylaxis, is  not
         available. The absence of pre- and post - HIV test counselling  was
         also reported.77


       *    the President of the Regional Court in the Western Cape  further
         told the Committee that district surgeons often lack expertise  and
         equipment; there have also been cases where district surgeons  have
         refused to examine drunk & drugged victims. The Masimanyane  report
         admitted reluctance on the part of district surgeons to  appear  in
         court, and there was even the  suggestion  that  district  surgeons
         deliberately completed the J88 form  in  an  inadequate  manner  to
         avoid being called as a witness.


       *    specific request was tabled by the  President  of  the  Regional
         Court to remove question 11(e)  ("date  of  last  intercourse  with
         consent") from Form J88 on the basis  that  it  is  an  unnecessary
         invasion of the privacy of the survivor.


  (b) Traditionally, forensic evidence collected by the health workers  has
       not been adequate for the prosecution of alleged offenders. The  Head
       of the Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Unit in  the  Office  of
       the Director of Public Prosecutions reported to the  Committee  on  a
       successful pilot project in Kimberley, which  provided  training  for
       forensic nurses to collect evidence and give expert evidence in  rape
       and sexual assault trials. The Office of the DPP indicated that their
       view was that forensic training had to  be  extended  to  nurses  and
       where  possible  they  should  be  able  to  give  expert   evidence,
       especially in rural areas, where  there  is  a  shortage  of  medical
       facilities.

18.    Physical  and  psychological  aspects  of  treatment  of  victims  of
      violence


  (a) It further appeared  that  few  health  care  workers  were  properly
       equipped to deal with both the physical and psychological aspects  of
       the treatment of women and children who  were  victims  of  violence,
       especially sexual violence.


  (b) The  Women's  Health  Project  reported  that  most  of  the  general
       practitioners surveyed by them felt inadequate in coping with  issues
       surrounding domestic violence. Thirty-three percent of  the  GPs  who
       attended  the  course  reported  that  they  saw  women  in   violent
       situations almost on a daily basis and a further 13  %  saw  them  at
       least once a week. Sixty two percent of the doctors saw women who had
       been raped more than once a month. Where the GPs could deal with  the
       physical aspects such as rape and injury, they were wary and felt ill-
       equipped to deal with  "private"  aspects  of  the  problem  such  as
       offering counselling and referring the survivor to social  structures
       that  could  offer  assistance  (such  as  legal   institutions   and
       shelters).


  (c) Ilitha Labantu reported that district  surgeons  and  hospitals  were
       only concerned about rape victims when the survivor  showed  physical
       injuries.


  (d) The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions  (DPP)  raised  the
       issue that medical students  must  be  trained  properly  on  how  to
       examine sexually assaulted victims.


  (e) It also appeared that health workers  were  perfectly  positioned  to
       assist women who are victims of violence, with a significant majority
       of women informing the health care worker  who  treats  them  of  the
       identity of their abuser.78


  (f) Many health workers, however, are not trained to deal with issues  of
       violence and an education and counselling  opportunity  is  therefore
       missed.79 Women's Health Project  reported  to  the  Committee  that,
       while the Department of Health recognises  the  problem  of  violence
       against  women  and  intends  to  develop  programmes,  there  is  no
       institutionalised training at  present  in  the  medical  or  nursing
       curriculum or in-service training to prepare health workers  to  deal
       with violence against women. This is borne out by the fact that  only
       10% of health workers routinely ask clients about domestic  violence:
       the reasons for not inquiring about abuse were feeling professionally
       and  personally  ill-equipped  to  deal  with  such  problems  (40%),
       perceptions that it is unnecessary (47%) and being too busy (13%).
  (g) In the Department of Health's 1998 progress report to the  Committee,
       the Department stated that it had joined other countries to discuss a
       resolution on the prevention of violence as a public health priority,
       that it participates in the  National  Network  on  Violence  Against
       Women and that it assisted in developing guidelines for survivors  of
       sexual offences.
  (h) The following issues80 remain to be addressed by  the  Department  of
       Health:


       *    the necessity of shifting the focus of health care services  for
         women  from  childbearing   to   reproductive   health,   including
         counselling  and  education  on  and  treatment  for   reproductive
         health, including infertility, sexually  transmitted  diseases  and
         especially violence against women; and


       *    training and  education  of  health  care  workers  in  domestic
         violence as a mainstream health issue.
19.   HIV/AIDS and violence against women


  (a) Women and children who have been the  victims  of  sexual  abuse  and
       violence face  special  risks  of  contracting  sexually  transmitted
       diseases (STDs), and in particular HIV/AIDS.


  (b) The violence and coercion involved in the sexual relationships of  so
       many men and women in South Africa  limit  especially  young  women's
       capacities to protect  themselves  against  HIV/AIDS.81  In  research
       conducted among women  in  three  South  African  provinces82,  CERSA
       reported that many women indicated that their partner openly  brought
       girlfriends home or boasted about them,  and  that  even  more  women
       indicated that they did not perceive that they were  able  to  refuse
       sex with their  husbands.  Given  the  pattern  of  gender  relations
       described in this research, it is likely that women would not be in a
       position to insist on condom use, even if  they  wanted  to,  and  in
       relationship characterised by physical violence  they  faced  further
       abuse.


  (c) Various perverse myths have arisen during the last decade  connecting
       sex with certain types of women with a cure for AIDS, thereby  adding
       a new dimension to sexual violence against women. In 1990, a document
       appeared calling on African men in the Durban area  to  acquire  "the
       AIDS antibody" by raping Indian women.  Even  though  the  flyer  was
       believed to be the work of a  "third  force"  intent  on  aggravating
       conflict in and between black  communities,  it  still  succeeded  in
       increasing the fear surrounding the disease. There is  also  a  well-
       circulated myth that sex with a child virgin will cure oneself of the
       virus.83


  (d) Lisa Vetten writes84 that, although it is extremely hard  to  show  a
       correlation between the incidence of rape and suspected or  confirmed
       HIV positivity, the desire the spread the disease to ensure one  does
       not die alone, coupled with anecdotes like those above, does  suggest
       that HIV/AIDS needs to seriously considered in trying  to  understand
       factors giving rise to rape in South Africa. Certainly, it would seem
       that rapists may be targeting  younger  girls  and  children  in  the
       belief that, being less sexually active, they are also less likely to
       be HIV positive.


  (e) Government funding of the controversial anti-retroviral  drug  AZT  -
       widely used in the  treatment  of  AIDS  -  for  rape  survivors  has
       received much attention in the media and from the public  during  the
       last months.


  (f) In an address to the National  Assembly  on  16  November  1999,  the
       National Minister of Health, Dr  M  E  Tshabalala-Msimang,  indicated
       that it is conservatively estimated that up  to  four  million  South
       Africans, approximately 10% of our  population,  have  been  infected
       with the HIV virus. The Department of Health reported  in  1999  that
       young women in there 20s have the highest infection rates. 26,1%  and
       26,9% of pregnant women aged 10-14 and  25-29  respectively  are  HIV
       positive.85


  (g) The Minister further stated in her address that the  government  does
       not supply AZT (which is generally used  in  conjunction  with  other
       drugs) to people infected with HIV/AIDS (including pregnant  mothers)
       and people who  may  have  been  infected  through  needle-pricks  or
       through rape, on two grounds:-


       *    affordability. In her address to Parliament, the Minister stated
         "We simply cannot afford AZT. At current market prices the cost  of
         the triple therapy drugs alone, for the treatment of  four  million
         South Africans, would be ten times the total South  African  health
         care budget, and 140 times what we spend on pharmaceuticals in  the
         public sector."


       *    the absence of proper research on  the  possible  harmful  side-
         effects of AZT, in particular its toxic profile.
  (h) With regard to the treatment of rape survivors, the Minister said the
       following:


         "I must draw your attention to the fact that AZT is not  registered
         for this particular use in South Africa,  or  to  the  best  of  my
         knowledge, anywhere else in the world.86
         "It is extremely unusual to expose healthy adults or children to  a
         drug like AZT, that was developed  for  use  in  chemotherapy,  and
         that is known to have caused cancer in animal  studies.  Few  drugs
         on our market are known carcinogens in  animal  models,  and  those
         that are, are  mainly  used  to  treat  patients  with  established
         serious conditions such as cancer, where their  effects  have  been
         carefully studied in  clinical  trials,  and  where  their  use  is
         strictly controlled.


         "We have absolutely no idea of what the effects are, either  short-
         term or long-term, of using AZT, a  known  carcinogen,  on  healthy
         people. The use of AZT is, at  the  present  time,  illegal,  aside
         from it being dangerous."

20.   INCARCERATION OF OFFENDERS


  (a) The Department furnished the Committee with  the  following  relevant
       statistics87 about prisoners presently in the care of the Department:-




       *    there are 12 034 prisoners convicted of sexual offences - 11% of
         the total sentenced prisoner population.


       *    there are 4 111 sentenced and unsentenced female prisoners:  871
         (21,1%) have been convicted of murder, 516 (12,6%) of assault,  347
         (8,4%) of narcotics-related crimes, and 326 (7,9%) of fraud.


       *    the average age of female prisoners was  30,77  years,  and  the
         average sentence of  those  already  sentenced  was  36,38  months.
         There are 315 infants in prison in the care of female prisoners.


       *    as at 30 April 1999, the number of HIV-positive prisoners was  1
         789, a 25,46% increase from the number of 1 426 in May 1998.


  (b) The Department of Correctional Services presented a  submission88  to
       the Committee describing their extensive education and rehabilitative
       counselling programmes for inmates89, and in particular  perpetrators
       of  sexual  violence.  Convicted  rapists  receive  counselling   and
       treatment from psychologists  as  they  have  been  identified  as  a
       priority  target  group.   The   Department   conceded   that   their
       rehabilitative efforts were difficult to measure due  to  a  lack  of
       statistical support.


  (c) The Department reported  on  their  education  programmes  for  women
       inmates (such as programmes on adult basic  education  and  training,
       reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS, parenting skills, and stress
       and anger management, alcohol and drug abuse).  The  Department  also
       makes use of NGO's, such as People Opposed to Women  Abuse  who  hold
       workshops on violence for female offenders who have committed violent
       crimes.


  (d) Departmental policy stipulates that mothers with  infants  and  young
       children90 must be kept in a separate Mother and  Child  Unit,  where
       surrounding and  facilities  are  complementary  to  sound  physical,
       social and mental care and development of the child.


  (e) It was also reported that the Department now had a programme in place
       by which all reasonable efforts were made to notify  victims  of  the
       parole hearings, release or escape of  prisoners.  Victims  may  make
       oral representations at parole hearings without  the  prisoner  being
       present, or written representations. The victim may also  request  to
       have certain conditions included in the prisoner's parole conditions,
       especially in rape and child abuse cases, such as that  the  offender
       is restricted from certain public or residential areas.


  (f) The Department's submission points out that a victim or  relative  is
       responsible to inform the Commissioner of  Correctional  Services  in
       writing of  her  contact  details,  changes  of  address,  and  costs
       incurred to attend the parole board hearing.


  (g) The Department also attempts to assist prisoners about to be  release
       by way of counselling, accommodation and transport  arrangements  and
       community  integration  programmes  to  assist  prisoners  to  obtain
       employment on release.

21.   RECENT RESEARCH ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN


  (a) Several research reports were  presented  to  the  Committee  at  the
       hearings. The findings, which appear important to the Committee,  are
       summarised below. The Committee requests that these summaries  should
       not be used without reference to the entire research reports,  copies
       of which are  available  from  the  Committee  clerk.  It  is  always
       necessary to take into account  the  limitations  of  such  research,
       which were  all  conducted  in  specific  geographic  areas,  and  to
       recognise the  danger  of  generalisation.  These  difficulties  only
       highlight the dire need for a proper statistical database  on  issues
       relating to violence against women and children and gender attitudes.


  (b) UNISA's Institute for Social and Health Sciences presented a research
       report on rape  surveillance  through  district  surgeon  offices  in
       Johannesburg from January  1996  to  December  1998.  Some  of  their
       findings on an analysis of 1401 rape cases reported at the  Hillbrow,
       Lenasia South and Chris Hani Baragwanath medico-legal clinics  during
       this period were the following:


       *    1% of survivors were between ages 15 and 25;


       *    0% of survivors were African, 10,2%  Coloured,  8,1%  White  and
         1,8% Asian;


       *    8,3% of rapes were perpetrated by a  person  of  the  same  race
         group as the survivor;


       *    8,2% of rapes occurred over the weekend, and  43,7%  took  place
         between 18h01 and 0h00, i.e. most rapes took  place  after  working
         hours and after dark;


       *    4,7% of survivors were acquainted with their  attacker  in  some
         way: 21,9% of victims knew  their  attacker  by  sight,  5,7%  were
         "friends", 4,2%  were  relatives,  3,4%  were  ex-boyfriends,  3,1%
         neighbours, 1,5% family acquaintances, 1,2% boyfriends and 0,8% co-
         workers91;


       *    ounger  victims  were  more  likely  to  know  their  attackers:
         offenders were known to 57,4% of victims  between  ages  1  to  12,
         53,8% of victims between  13  to  19  years  (the  perpetrator  was
         unknown to 61,6% of victims between 20 to 30, 64% of 31 to 40,  and
         83,3% of those older than 50);


       *    1% of rapes were committed in open fields, 29,1% in the rapist's
         home, and  14,2%  in  the  victim's  home.  32  cases  occurred  in
         Hillbrow, 70 in the Johannesburg CBD, 60 in  Lenasia,  50  each  in
         Berea, Orange Farm, Soweto, and 46 in Joubert Park;


       *    single perpetrator committed 73% of rapes,  while  27%  involved
         multiple attackers (two attackers - 13,6%, three attackers  -  6,4%
         and four attackers - 7%);


       *    where a single perpetrator was involved, 51,5%  of  perpetrators
         were known to their victims, and 48,2% of rapes occurred  in  homes
         (32,3% in the rapist's home and 15,9% in the victim's home);


       *     where  multiple  attackers  were   involved,   75,1%   of   the
         perpetrators were strangers  to  the  victims,  and  50,8%  of  the
         attacks occurred in public areas;


       *    weapons were used in 54,9% of attacks: mostly knives (50,9%) and
         firearms (35,3%).  In  85,5%  of  cases  the  weapon  was  used  to
         threaten only.


  (c) UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law and Development  Project
       presented a submission on research undertaken in rural areas  in  the
       Southern Cape92, which found that the statistics and dynamics of rape
       are similar in rural areas to those in urban centres, but significant
       differences are identified in access to justice & support  after  the
       attack. Participating women estimated that 80% of women, on  average,
       are victims of ongoing domestic violence.


  (d) Rural women experienced and witnessed  injuries  ranging  from  burns
       from boiling water to severe head  injuries,  resulting  in  loss  of
       hearing and sight. Steel pipes, sticks,  knives,  furniture,  boiling
       water, fists, pieces of timber and kitchen utensils were all used  on
       women in  their  communities.  Participants  stated  that,  in  their
       community, men were "professionals" in domestic violence,  hitting  a
       woman on her body and not on her face, so that the injuries  are  not
       too identifiable, but when she has been accused of infidelity,  women
       sustain head and facial injuries "to make her ugly to other men".


  (e) One participant described the  domestic  sexual  abuse  of  a  family
       member as follows:


         "What can she do if he comes home, drunk,  kicking  the  door,  the
         children and everything has gone mad?  When  she  is  sleeping,  he
         turns up the music loud and come to her and makes  her  sleep  with
         him. And she only wants to please her  husband  but  she  does  not
         like it. He is very aggressive in their  bed  with.  She  does  not
         believe it's really rape when it is her husband. Neither  does  he.
         He says 'you're my wife, I can do what I want to do'.


         "Even if she says no, her husband  gets  cross  and  hits  her  and
         keeps doing what he wants to  do.  It  is  very  painful,  but  she
         cannot scream because her children are there. That is why he  turns
         on the music. But, she says her children know  what  is  happening.
         She can hear them crying.


         "She reports him to his family. His family says 'what's wrong  with
         you that you don't want to please your husband'  or  'what  are  we
         supposed to do ... must have sex with your husband'.


         "Sometimes husbands listen but they mostly say it is  nonsense  and
         if the women do not like it, they must leave the house.  What  must
         we do? Go to the police? Even if you are raped by a  stranger  they
         don't believe you and now  you  must  tell  them  your  husband  is
         raping you? They are just as bad as  the  husbands.  They  ridicule
         you too and tell you that you are full of shit and you are  wasting
         their time. You can have scars on your face ...  bleeding  ...  and
         the police will send you home to 'sort it out with  him'.  Rape  by
         your husband is only real in the law."


  (f)  Participants  listed  domestic  violence,  alcoholism,  under-   and
       unemployment, the rape of women and property crime as major  problems
       in their communities. Participants reported a link quantified at  75%
       to 100% between alcohol and  violence  in  their  communities:  Women
       reported that the highest levels of crime against women and children,
       particularly sexual assault and rape, occurred in close proximity  to
       shebeens. It also appeared that age restrictions for  buying  alcohol
       were almost non-existent.


  (g) Rape and the sexual molestation of children were seen as the  biggest
       threats to women and girl children in the communities, not  only  due
       to the violation of women's physical and sexual integrity,  but  also
       due  to  other  consequences  of  rape,  such   as   death,   injury,
       impregnation and STD's.


  (h) Economic abuse was a notable feature of the  research,  and  included
       withholding money, stealing money earned by her, throwing the  victim
       and her children out of the home (or threatening to  do  so)  or  the
       practice of giving money to the eldest son (no matter how old he is).
       But most commonly, men gave money irregularly to the women to provide
       for their families, and women were subsequently beaten if the husband
       found meals or the home unsatisfactory.


  (i) Women listed the following  causes  of  domestic  violence:  Lack  of
       respect for women, problems with children (misbehaviour or  neglect),
       unemployment and alcohol abuse, suspicion or  jealousy,  and  culture
       (with special reference to lobola).
  (j) The report lists the following reasons  for  the  limited  access  to
       justice for rural women:


       *    Economic disempowerment (as a result of lack  of  education  and
         unemployment) was mentioned  as  being  the  single  factor,  which
         prevent women from removing themselves from the domestic  violence.
         Most women who participated in the research had  no  credit  rating
         or  no  cash  to  draw  on  in  an   emergency.   These   financial
         restrictions resulted in isolation and domestic "confinement",  and
         dictated their physical mobility, access to education,  recreation,
         where they could shop, what they could buy and also access to  each
         other.


       *    Women in rural areas  lack  nearby  services  and  the  cost  of
         transport decreases a woman's ability to leave  violent  situations
         or even seek information or assistance to deal  with  the  problem.
         Distances to basic public services are great and child  care  is  a
         problem if travel is necessary. There are no or  limited  taxi  and
         bus services and if they do exist they are expensive.


       *    Limited access to state and private health, welfare and  justice
         services results in systemic discrimination by the state in  almost
         every area of rural women's lives.


       *    Women in rural areas have little option but  to  remain  in  the
         home with the offender because there are no accessible safe  houses
         or shelters. Rural women remain in  abusive  relationships  because
         they have little access to economic resources.


       *    Women in small rural communities articulate fears  of  community
         gossip  or  alienation  from  their  communities   if   they   seek
         assistance.


       *    Women remain powerless over alcoholism within their communities.


       *    Very few development services exist in rural communities.


  (k) The combined effects of poverty and violence for rural women  in  the
       Southern Cape create formidable barriers to women's equality,  mental
       and physical health, and their full participation in  civil  society.
       Current law contains systemic inequalities,  state  legal  structures
       are inherently discriminatory against women and,  more  specifically,
       do not meet the needs of rural women.93
  (l) The Medical Research Council's Centre for Epidemiological Research in
       SA ("CERSA") presented three research reports at the hearings,  which
       will be dealt with in turn below.


  (m) CERSA presented a research report on domestic violence based  on  the
       first major community-based prevalence study conducted among women in
       Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga & the Northern Province.94 Its main findings
       were the following:-


       *    emotional, financial and physical abuse are common  features  of
         relationships and that many women have been raped;


       *     physical  violence  often  continues   during   pregnancy   and
         constitutes an important cause of reproductive morbidity;


       *    many women are injured by their partners and considerable health
         sector  resources  are  expended  providing  treatment  for   these
         injuries;


       *    injuries result  in  costs  being  incurred  in  other  sectors,
         notable to the family and the women's community  and  to  employers
         in the national economy.


  (n) The report's findings on the prevalence of violence against women  is
       demonstrated in the following table:-
Eastern-Cape     Mpumalanga  Northern Cape
Abuse by a current or ex-partner in the past
26,8% 28,4% 19,1%
Abuse by a current or ex-partner in the last year
10,9% 11,9% 4,5%
Rape
4,5%  7,2%  4,8%
Physical abuse during pregnancy
9,1%  6,7%  4,7%


  (o) The study shows that considerable mental distress is associated  with
       abuse. Of the women who reported being abused in the past year, 27,9%
       (Eastern  Cape),  24%  (Mpumalanga)  and  14,3%  (Northern  Province)
       indicated that they have suicidal thoughts.


  (p) When asked about women's perceptions of  culturally  accepted  gender
       relations, there was considerable agreement with  patriarchal  gender
       relations (including subservience of women to her husband, punishment
       of her by him in some situations, male ownership  of  women  and  the
       interpretation of  beating  as  a  sign  of  love),  but  women  also
       indicated that the prevailing gender attitudes in their  culture  was
       much more patriarchal than their personal views, and  a  considerable
       number  of  women  disagreed  with  notions  they  conceded   to   be
       "culturally accepted", such as "if a man pays lobola for his wife she
       must have sex when he wants  it".  Only  57%  (Eastern  Cape),  40,4%
       (Mpumalanga) and 40,9% (Northern Cape) of women believed that a woman
       can refuse to have sex with her husband. 80,1% (Eastern Cape),  91,4%
       (Mpumalanga) and 86,8% (Northern Cape) of women indicated that a  man
       hitting his wife or girlfriend was never acceptable.


  (q) The report also mentions that  there  was  considerable  disagreement
       amongst the women about the meaning  attached  by  their  culture  to
       customs like lobola, indicating the possibility of popular discussion
       and examination of these traditions.


  (r) Research conducted amongst  pregnant  Xhosa-speaking  adolescents  in
       Khayelitsha95, initially intended to focus on  contraception,  bodily
       knowledge and pregnancy,  found  that  male  violence  dominated  the
       sexual relationship of these women. Conditions and timing of sex were
       entirely defined by their male partners through the use  of  violence
       and  through  the  circulation  of  certain  constructions  of  love,
       intercourse and entitlement to  which  the  women  were  expected  to
       submit. The research report also states that violence  against  young
       women  within  their  sexual  relationship  has   been   particularly
       neglected in the  spheres  of  health  and  education.  Some  of  the
       findings are the following:


       *    First sexual encounters were mostly reported to have occurred at
         a young age, often 12 years, with a  male  partner  about  5  years
         older.


       *    Many participants indicated that sex was  a  strategy  to  avoid
         peer ostracism,  and  the  mystifying  of  sex  and  its  mechanics
         emerged repeatedly through a lack of input by sexually  experienced
         female peers.


       *    Women were therefore initiated into the sexual matters  by  men,
         who repeatedly refused to explain what was  about  to  take  place.
         Most participants reported that they had been deceived  or  coerced
         into sex, and that attempted resistance was met  with  violence  or
         threats of violence.


       *    22 of the 24 participants reported having been beaten  by  their
         partners on multiple occasions, and  the  remaining  two  had  been
         threatened with assault. The assault occurred primarily when  women
         attempted to refuse sexual  intercourse,  which  the  women  stated
         signified,  in  men's  eyes,  that  the  women  had  other   sexual
         partners. Assault was perceived to be male  strategy  for  "getting
         you to love him".


       *    Women said that the forced  intercourse  they  experienced  with
         their partners could never be termed rape.


       *    Many women continued intercourse and did not attempt to end  the
         relationship  because  they  feared  more  violence.  Despite   the
         violence, the men demonstrated material generosity in the  form  of
         clothes, food and money. One participant said  "it  is  alright  as
         long as he doesn't beat me every day."


       *    Most participants stated that they felt unable to discuss sexual
         matters and contraception with their male partners,  and  for  some
         contraception appeared to be completely non-negotiable in  view  of
         angry responses by their male partners when the issue was raised.


       *    Out of 24 adolescent women, only two mentioned  that  they  ever
         actively wanted to have sex now, but  emphasises  that  women  were
         not allowed to demonstrate  desire  or  initiate  sex.  Many  women
         stated a desire to be in a  non-sexual  relationship  characterised
         by co-operation until they were older.


  (s) CERSA also reported on  research  conducted  among  young  people  in
       Umtata96. Some of their key findings were the following:-


       *    Many participants reported physical assault and rape or coercive
         sex. Out of the thirty 16-26 year olds who participated, 16 out  of
         22 girls reported assault by at least one male partner, and  6  out
         of 8 boys admitted to having beaten their girlfriends on more  than
         one occasion.


       *    Violence was used by boys as a way of imposing the  rules  of  a
         relationship  and   was   particularly   associated   with   girls'
         rejections of "proposals of love", attempts to  end  relationships,
         refusals  of  sex  and  their  actual  or   suspected   infidelity.
         Relationships  were  characterised  by  extreme  suspicion   around
         partners' activities with others, and it appeared to  be  a  common
         assumption that a refusal to have sex implied  that  the  girl  had
         another sexual partner.


       *    Physical violence was a way of life for not only the  teenagers,
         but in all community relationships.


       *    The gender identities of  the  participants  were  substantially
         constructed in terms of their success in sexual relationships,  and
         pursuits  of  gaining  and  keeping  boy-  and   girlfriends   were
         overwhelming preoccupations for these young people.


       *    Neither teachers nor parents made any  effort  to  promote  safe
         dating  or  to  interfere  in  the   violent   activities.   Sexual
         relationships  between  girls  and  male  teachers  were   commonly
         reported, and often involved coercion  and  even  violence  on  the
         part of the teachers.
  (t) A research report amongst male municipal workers in Cape  Town  aimed
       at establishing the prevalence of abuse as reported by men,  as  well
       as risk factors associated with woman abuse.  Some  of  the  findings
       were the following:-


       *    44% of men reported  having  physically  or  sexually  abused  a
         partner within the last 10 years - 8% reported  physically  abusing
         a partner in the last year.


       *    One third of the  44%  said  they  had  raped  (more  often)  or
         attempted to rape their partner.


       *    Men who reported physical and sexual abuse was five  times  more
         likely to use psychological abuse, four times more  likely  to  use
         verbal abuse and twice as likely to use economic abuse.


       *    75% of the abusers said it was "OK" to hit a woman, and  another
         25%  of  those  who  didn't  report   abuse   also   agreed.    The
         circumstances given by the men when it is "OK" to hit a woman  were
         "when she neglects her responsibilities", "when there are no  clean
         clothes", "when she come home late", "when she  don't  listen"  and
         "when she is cheeky".


       *    The sample consisted of 64,7% Coloured men, 25.2% African,  8,6%
         white and 1,5% Asian men.  From  this  sample,  abusers  were  more
         likely to be young and Coloured men, likely to have been  in  jail,
         to have been arrested, to have  belonged  to  a  gang;  non-abusers
         were likely to have had education beyond standard 8 and  likely  to
         be active in religion.


       *    Abusers acknowledged that their use of alcohol and marijuana was
         a problem.


       *    Witnessing abuse of their mothers by their fathers  as  a  child
         was associated with being an abuser.  34,2%  of  men  who  reported
         abuse reported witnessing their mothers' abuse by their  father  or
         a boyfriend, while only 15,9% of  men  who  did  not  report  abuse
         witnessed such behaviour. 38,5% of  men  who  reported  abuse  also
         reported witnessing their  sisters'  abuse  by  her  husband  or  a
         boyfriend, while 21,2% of men who did not  report  abuse  witnessed
         such behaviour. An average of 86,1% of the entire  sample  reported
         receiving physical punishment as a child - men related  stories  of
         severe discipline and bizarre punishment  in  which  their  fathers
         had a central role.


       *    The report mentions that, during their interviews, many  of  the
         men became emotional when talking about  their  childhood  and  the
         abuse of their mothers, and  many  said  they  had  never  had  the
         opportunity to talk about it before.


       *    It is apparent from the study that men's attitudes towards women
         and their perceived roles influenced the reasons for conflict  with
         partners in abusive relationships.  In  relationships  where  there
         was less expectation that a woman should obey her partner, less  of
         belief in male sexual entitlement, less fear  of  infidelity,  much
         less conflict was experienced. Men reported "she sits on his  head"
         or "she answered him back" or "talking to  other  men"  as  reasons
         for conflict.


       *    Many men reported being frustrated at work where  they  have  to
         "accept the shit of the bosses". One explained his  frustration  of
         not being able to provide adequately for his family as "it  is  one
         of the things to be a man".


       *    Most of the men did  not  think  shouting  and  swearing  at  or
         humiliating a woman was a form of violence.


  (u) The Centre for Rural Legal Studies furnished  the  Committee  with  a
       research report on the plight of women farm workers  in  the  Western
       Cape. The report recounts attitudes of violence and abuse among  male
       farmworkers, reinforced by extreme financial dependence of women:


       *    67% of all employers stated that  domestic  violence  occurs  on
         their farms.


       *    50,9% of employers agreed  that  they  tacitly  include  a  male
         worker's female partner in his employment agreement, while  60%  of
         employers insist that a male worker's partner must be available  to
         work on the farm.


       *    52,4% of women report that the house is  linked  to  their  male
         partner's contract. 48,6% of employers stated that, should  a  male
         worker leave or die, his female partner would  have  to  leave  the
         farm.


       *    Only 21,1% of women stated that they had access  to  legal  aid,
         and more than half of women said  it  was  extremely  difficult  to
         access these services during working hours.


  (v) The 1998  South  Africa  Demographic  and  Health  Survey97  reported
       statistics on violence against women that  were  significantly  lower
       than those reported by other studies:-


       *    13% of women reported having been beaten by a partners, of which
         half reported abuse in the last year.
       *    43% of those who  reported  abuse  in  the  last  year  reported
         needing medical attention as a result of such beatings.


       *    Only 4% of women who had ever been  pregnant  reported  physical
         abuse during pregnancy.


       *    Only 4% of all women reported ever having been raped.


  (w) The Survey mentions that the under-reporting of  gender  violence  is
       well-recognised and should be taken into account in interpreting  its
       results, especially in view of other research by the MRC:


         "The usual  explanations  for  under-reporting  are  concern  about
         recrimination, fear of identifying oneself as an abused  woman  due
         to a socialisation that encourages women to accept chastisement  as
         a male prerogative, feelings of shame about the assault and  having
         provoked it, perceptions that it is a private  matter  and  loyalty
         to the abuser."


  (x) The Survey also records that one  in  five  currently  married  women
       reported  economic  maltreatment,  indicated  by  the  regular   non-
       provision of money for food, rent or bills whilst  having  money  for
       other things.

22.   PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION


  (a) It emerged strongly from the hearings that rape, sexual  assault  and
       domestic violence are more prevalent in South  African  society  than
       ever recognised98, and that fear and expectation of violence is a way
       of life for many South African women.


         "It's always present. You never know when it is coming.  There  are
         times when you do and you have to just wait until he gets home  and
         just does it. Then it is over and you are relieved. The waiting  is
         the worst part."99
         "We know the cycle well. No one has to explain it to  us.  You  see
         his mood rising ... he  is  anxious  or  angry  or  drunk  or  just
         showing his manliness to his friends ... it can  be  anything.  You
         are never prepared for it and you are always prepared for  it.  You
         never believe it when it happens even if it  happens  everyday.  He
         says he is sorry and will not do it again and you feel relief,  but
         you know the calm before another storm."100


  (b) The hearings also shattered the common myth  that  the  rapist  is  a
       stranger who lurks in dark alleys. Research reports presented to  the
       committee  clearly  showed  that  most  violence  against  women   is
       perpetrated  by  a  person  with  whom  the  victim  or  survivor  is
       acquainted in some or other way. Especially younger victims are  much
       more likely to know their attackers, with 57,4% of offenders known to
       victims between ages 1 to 12, and 53,8% if victims between ages 13 to
       19.101


  (c) Submissions  repeatedly  mentioned  our  history  of  oppression  and
       disregard for human rights as the context in which  violence  against
       women  flourished,  and  emphasised  the  importance  of   addressing
       violence against women by placing it both  within  a  historical  and
       political perspective and to recognise the influence of apartheid  in
       the present mindset of individuals,  communities  and  society  as  a
       whole. There is a need to acknowledge the pain of the  past  and  the
       influence this has on the entire nation. The  fragmentation  existing
       within communities is indicative of the fragmentation of identity  of
       individuals; violence against women is just one  of  the  effects  of
       such fragmentation.


         "We believe that one of the reasons why we are not seeing a  change
         in attitude of the judiciary or why rape and domestic  violence  is
         almost condoned at community level, is because we have not  created
         adequate   space   in   the   transformation   process   for    the
         acknowledgment of our past traumas  and  a  lack  of  adequate  and
         appropriate mechanisms for healing  the  pain  which  every  single
         citizen in this country has been subjected to."102


       It was also argued that the division of the people of  this  country
       according to race contributed to the prevalence of  violence  against
       women: notions of racial superiority and  separation  led  to  forced
       removals,  states  of  emergency  and  the  artificial  creation   of
       "homelands", thereby breaking up traditional family structures.103


  (d) In her submission104 to  the  Committee,  Lisa  Vetten  explored  the
       following factors contributing to violence  against  women  in  South
       Africa:-


       *    Imbedded patriarchy:


         *  Vetten  describes  this  ideology  of  granting  men  power  and
           privilege over women as the one factor unifying  South  Africa's
           various  cultural  and  ethnic   groups.   Culturally   imbedded
           patriarchal gender identities of  women  as  receptive,  caring,
           emotional, passive and submissive  and  men  as  self-assertive,
           competitive,  rational  and  aggressive  have  resulted  in  the
           treatment of women of all colours as second class citizens,  and
           women's confinement to the private sphere of the home while  men
           are engaged in the public sphere of work, community affairs  and
           politics.


         *   These  patriarchally  determined  gender  identities  manifests
           itself in contemporary  understandings  of  lobola.  Since  cash
           payments can now be made to the family, some men regard marriage
           as a financial transaction of "buying" a wife.


         *  Patriarchy has severe economic consequences for women,  who  are
           much more likely to be unemployed  and  without  access  to  any
           income of  their  own,  while  men  control  the  allocation  of
           household finances and even hamper women's efforts to obtain and
           keep employment, leaving women  totally  financially  dependent.
           Women's financial dependence on  men  was  repeatedly  cited  in
           submissions as the main reason for women's inability  to  remove
           herself and her children from a violent domestic situation.


         *  Submissions also  mentioned  deepening  levels  of  poverty  and
           inequality in post-apartheid South Africa,  which  most  closely
           affects women as the major component of the unemployed in  South
           Africa. Masimanyane said in their submission  to  the  Committee
           that economic  deprivation  and  other  political  factors  have
           destroyed people's identities and eroded their  self-esteem  and
           self-worth.105 Poverty also directly affects women's  access  to
           health care, the police and the criminal justice system.
         *  CERSA also reported deep-rooted  patriarchy  and  a  concomitant
           lack of respect for women, who are often seen as the property of
           their husbands or fathers or communities, as  a  factor  in  the
           scourge of violence against women. Authors have also argued that
           violent practices are deployed by men against women in  attempts
           to maintain particular self-images and social evaluation in  the
           face of real or imagined threats, i.e. to prove  that  they  are
           "real  men"  and  their  women  are  under  their  control.   In
           particular situations, the use of certain forms of  violence  by
           men to  control  and  punish  women  is  perceived  as  socially
           acceptable to both men and women of all ages.106


         *   Gendered  constructions  of  male  and  female  sexuality  have
           created the idea that men should be sexually  active  and  women
           passive and without sexual desire,  which  cultural  prohibition
           implies to some men that women need to be forced to have sex  in
           a context where it is not acceptable for women to  indicate  her
           consent.  It  is  this  cultural  belief,  which  leads  to  the
           dangerous practice of dry sex, where women go to  great  lengths
           to avoid the  natural  vaginal  lubrication  of  sexual  arousal
           (believed to be a sign of promiscuity),  a  practice  that  pose
           serious   risks   for   women's   health   by   increasing   her
           susceptibility to STD's and HIV/AIDS.


         *  Research has shown  a  vast  discrepancy  in  attitudes  to  the
           fidelity required from men and women: where it is acceptable for
           a man to have many sexual partners, a woman is  required  to  be
           faithful  to  one  partner.  This  practice  obviously  as  dire
           consequences for women's health.


       *    The intersection of race and gender oppression:


         *  Examples of the double  burden  of  oppression  borne  by  black
           women are slavery and indentured  servitude.  Women  slaves  and
           their bodies were considered the property of their  owners,  and
           in 180 years of slavery in the Cape not one man was convicted of
           raping a woman slave.


         *  The discriminatory construction of sexuality for men  and  women
           has been compounded on a racial level  in  South  Africa,  where
           black women's bodies have been violated throughout its  history.
           Where perpetrator of violence against a black woman was a  white
           man, his acts were often ignored, while black men who  assaulted
           or raped white women were often given the death penalty.107


       *    Militarisation:


         *  The apartheid era militarisation of South Africa and the use  of
           violent  repression  together   with   anti-apartheid   movement
           decisions about education and armed reaction  have  resulted  in
           entire generations of "lost" and violent young men and a general
           culture of violence - where violence is  seen  as  a  legitimate
           means of conflict resolution.


         *  In  addition,  a  culture  was  cultivated  in  which  qualities
           regarded as "feminine" is treated with  contempt  as  "weakness"
           and a tough, aggressive, brutal and competitive  masculinity  is
           promoted. This culture, combined with the general  psychological
           consequences of violence and war, has had a  destructive  effect
           on the lives of many South African men.


         *   Professor  Jacklyn  Cock108  similarly  blamed  the  legacy  of
           militarisation, which involves "a proliferation of weaponry  and
           ideas which  link  violence  to  masculinity.  This  militarised
           masculinity puts women  and  children  at  risk.  This  risk  is
           amplified in situations of poverty, unemployment and  inequality
           were the human needs for identity  and  security  are  not  met.
           These two factors combine to make women and children  the  shock
           absorbers of violence and frustration."109


       *    Changes in the social order


         *  Research has shown that an increase in violence  against  women,
           and especially sexual violence,  often  occurs  in  response  to
           changes in the social order. Very obvious examples hereof can be
           found in the Ma Rashea gans formed  by  Basotho  men  after  the
           Second World War to "control" and punish women who were becoming
           increasingly independent, as a result of, inter alia,  migration
           by men to South Africa in search of work, and in  "jackrolling",
           a practice prevalent in the late 1980s whereby young men too old
           to return to school and unable to find jobs abducted  and  raped
           schoolgirls in the hope of impregnating them  and  ending  their
           education.


         *  Violence against women is often  also  intended  to  communicate
           messages of victory over other men, which  manifests  itself  in
           the phenomenon of raping women in the presence of men  perceived
           to be the rapists' enemies.


         *  Rape is also used  as  a  means  of  punishing  sexually  active
           women, and girls suspected of or known to  have  other  partners
           are sometimes gang-raped by their male  partner's  acquaintances
           as a form of punishment.110


       *    Legitimising violence  against  women:  Vetten  points  out  the
         difficulties created by African traditional and customary law,  and
         mentions, by way of example, the following  customs  oppressive  to
         women:


         *   the  levirate:  the  continuation  of  the  deceased  husband's
           marriage through a brother or other male relative;


         *  the sororate: requiring the  younger  sister  of  an  apparently
           barren wife to take  her  place  and  produce  children  on  her
           behalf;


         *  polygamy: taking more than one wife;


         *  child betrothal and forced marriages;


         *  inheritance laws, by which the family's property and  wealth  is
           passed down from father to son, which may leave women  destitute
           on the death of their husbands;


         *  women's minor status;


         *  lobola (or bohali or  bogadi):  the  practice  of  consolidating
           marriage through the exchange of women and cattle (or  cash)  by
           the father of the bride and the prospective husband.


  (e) Nisaa made the submission that government inaction is a factor, which
       contributes to the  high  level  of  gender  violence  in  societies.
       Despite the legal system's role as  an  institution  for  censure  of
       socially unacceptable acts, it often  appears  to  tolerate  acts  of
       violence against women, particularly so when the violence  occurs  in
       the home. The failure  of  the  legal  system  to  prosecute  alleged
       rapists and batterers and to secure convictions with hefty  sentences
       sends a powerful message to men that their  violence  is  acceptable,
       and women internalise the message that their lives and safety are not
       worthy of protection. The law also does  not  name  violence  against
       women, and it has been left to the women's  movement  to  coin  terms
       such  as  "domestic  violence",  "sexual  harassment",  "date  rape",
       "femicide",  "forced  prostitution",  "sex-selective  abortions"  and
       "genital  mutilation".  Many  abuses  women  suffer   have   remained
       invisible in mainstream legal culture.


  (f) Submissions also complained that, despite its wide-ranging powers  to
       educate the public, the media was irresponsible in its  reporting  of
       violence against  women,  perpetuating  stereotypes  and  relying  on
       sensationalism. The Commission on  Gender  Equality  (CGE)  made  the
       following submissions in this regard to the Committee:


       *     Reporting  on  rape  is  characterised  by  sensationalism   in
         reporting on extreme and sadistic violence; stereotypes  about  the
         myth of rape by a deranged stranger (while in  reality  the  rapist
         is  much  more  likely  to  be  the  man  next  door)111,  and  the
         "blameworthiness" of sexually experienced  victims;  media  reports
         differ substantially  when  the  accused  exhibits  other  criminal
         behaviour (like being a gang  member)  than  when  the  accused  is
         businessman or a sport celebrity (such as in the  case  of  Makhaya
         Ntini); CGE is concerned that the recent  voluntary  disclosure  of
         the identities of rape victims may lead to  the  violation  of  the
         survivor's right to privacy where she does not choose to do so.


       *    The reporting of femicide is  often  done  in  a  manner,  which
         obscures the nature of the crime, such as "Woman  dies  after  row"
         or "Policeman among 3 killed as lovers' tiff ends in tragedy."


       *    Domestic violence has received very little  attention  from  the
         media, and tends only to do so in the  cases  of  celebrities.  The
         nuclear family is often depicted as  the  norm  in  South  Africa's
         media, despite the reality  that  more  South  Africans  belong  to
         extended  family   units,   blended   households   or   female-only
         households.


       *    The  attitudes  of  radio  presenters  can  serve  to  reinforce
         prejudices, especially in a country where illiteracy levels are  so
         high and more people have access to radio than to television.


       *    The importance of regulatory bodies such as  the  IBA,  ASA  and
         Press Ombudsman was emphasised, as  well  as  the  need  for  clear
         guidelines and disciplinary procedures.


  (g)  The  destructive  potential  of  inaccurate  media   reporting   was
       illustrated in the reporting of the Committee's  attempts  to  engage
       members of the judiciary in  constructive  discussions  about  issues
       relating to violence against women. Such attempts were  irresponsibly
       and inaccurately portrayed as a "summons" by the Committee  to  Judge
       John  Foxcroft,  thereby  creating  imaginary  conflict  between  the
       Committee and the judiciary.112


  (h) The Commission for Gender Equality also mentioned that the media  has
       played an important role in  putting  issues  such  as  rape  on  the
       national agenda.


  (i) Both government submissions and those of NGO's reported  an  enormous
       lack of understanding of violence against women by the  public.  Both
       men and women are ignorant of women's rights to be free of  violence,
       especially domestic violence. For example, many men and  women  still
       do not recognise marital rape as a crime.


  (j) It was also apparent from the submissions that both men and women are
       uninformed about sex and  sexual  health,  and  women  are  therefore
       unable to act to protect themselves, and to provide  information  and
       support to other young women.113


  (k) Various submissions stressed  the  importance  of  involving  men  in
       programmes on eradicating violence against women.  It  was  suggested
       that all people involved in men's programmes should attend a national
       forum  to  discuss  violence  against  women.  Men  must  develop   a
       partnership with women's groups in addressing the problems which  men
       and women face; it is necessary to acknowledge that  men  too  suffer
       from the traumas of the past.114


  (l) Although they did not participate  in  the  hearings,  the  Committee
       Chair has addressed  shopstewards  in  the  COSATU  campaign  against
       violence against women in conjunction  with  their  campaign  against
       HIV/AIDS. COSATU has produced  a  guide  for  shopstewards  on  these
       issues, and is also in the process of holding training workshops  for
       its shop stewards. The campaign encourages the shopstewards to do the
       following:


       *    Educate their members about violence against women;


       *    Take up sexual harassment cases on behalf of their members;


       *    Ensure that there are sexual harassment grievance procedures  in
         the terms and conditions of employment at their workplace;
       *    Develop a code of conduct on sexual harassment together with the
         employer;


       *    Talk to known abusers among their members about their abuse;


       *    Assist any woman member who is being abused and ensure that  she
         is given time off to go to  court  or  to  move  her  children  and
         belongings to a safe place;
       *    Help abused women to negotiate a transfer to a different town to
         escape the violence;


       *    Ensure that women are able to reach their transport safely after
         work;


            Invite women leaders to speak at the workplace so  that  workers
         will understand and stop violence against women;


       *    Ensure that the Employment Equity Act is implemented;


       *    Negotiate with their employer to provide childcare.


  (m) The South African education  system,  which  ought  to  be  the  main
       channel of promoting awareness of gendered violence among the  youth,
       has been and remains in a  state  of  transition.  Not  only  is  the
       Department of Education burdened with the task of  reconstructing  an
       education system ravaged by  apartheid,  but  also  our  schools  are
       staffed by teachers who are products of an apartheid education system
       themselves.


  (n)  CEDAW  requires  government  to  "adopt  all  appropriate  measures,
       especially in the field  of  education,  to  modify  the  social  and
       cultural patterns of conduct  of  men  and  women  and  to  eliminate
       prejudices, customary practices and all other practices based on  the
       idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes and  on
       stereotyped roles for men and women."115


  (o) In its  Gender  Equity  Task  Team  report  (the  GETT  report),  the
       Department  of  Education  identified  the  following  issues  to  be
       considered and addressed relating to gender-sensitive  education  and
       violence against women:-


       *    identifying means of correcting gender imbalances in  enrolment,
         dropout rates, subject choice, career paths and performance;
       *    the advantages and disadvantages single sex schools;


       *    sexism in curricula, textbooks, teaching and guidance;


       *    the poor representation of women in management positions; and


       *    sexism, sexual harassment and violence throughout the  education
         system.


  (p) The GETT report also lists the following recommendations116:-


       *    That new legislation should be developed to  make  explicit  the
         legal responsibilities  of  education  authorities  to  uphold  the
         rights of students to be free from discrimination  and  harassment.
         Such  legislation  should  also  define  gendered  and  sex   based
         harassment  and  should  be  made  unlawful  in  all  contexts   in
         educational settings.


       *    That the National Department  of  Education  should  develop  an
         interim policy on sex and gender based harassment and violence.


       *    That the National  Department  of  Education  should  develop  a
         training package for educational managers on  their  responsibility
         to prevent discrimination, violence  and  harassment,  as  well  as
         curriculum packages which incorporate  learning  about  gender  and
         violence at all levels of education.
  (q) The Department of Education participated  in  the  hearings  and  the
       Minister of Education delivered an oral submission to  the  Committee
       regarding the  Minister  and  the  Department's  efforts  to  address
       violence against women.


  (r) The Department  of  Education's  1997  report  on  Gender  Equity  in
       Education dealt with sex based violence in schools, and states  inter
       alia that "the sheer dimension of sex or gender  based  violence  and
       harassment in education in SA subverts the right of women and  girls,
       and many boys, to participate in education on the same basis as  most
       men and boys."


  (s) The Director-General of Education reported to the Committee that,  in
       their attempts to include sex and gender education in the curriculum,
       they had initially experienced some resistance from sections  of  the
       communities who did not want to expose small children  to  issues  of
       sexuality. This problem had abated somewhat, and it  was  hoped  that
       the issue could be more appropriately addressed under the auspices of
       Curriculum 2005.


  (t) The Minister of Education reported to the  Committee  that  a  Gender
       Equity Directorate had been established in April 1999,  which  liases
       with Gender Focal  Persons  in  Provincial  Departments  through  the
       National   Gender   Coordination   Committee.   An   Interim   Gender
       Coordinating Committee from the four branches of the  Department  had
       also been established.


  (u) The  Department  of  Education  was  also  preparing  gender-training
       programmes for all officials, both national and provincial,  as  well
       as a Mainstreaming Handbook for use by gender officers.


  (v) A  school-based  project  on  sex-based  &  gender-based  violence  &
       harassment (McGill University in Canada) was being developed,  and  a
       successful and well-attended seminar on sexual harassment in  schools
       was held in May 1999.


  (w) The Committee would like  to  receive  a  formal  response  from  the
       Department of Education on the following issues117:-


       *    the Department's efforts to ensure that gender  issues  are  not
         isolated to the Gender Equity Unit;


       *    what programmes the Department is planning to raise awareness in
         both educational institutions  and  the  general  public  to  raise
         awareness of sexism and violence against women, and  in  particular
         the pre-service  and  in-service  training  of  teachers  regarding
         these issues;


       *    the provision  of  extended  day  care  facilities  for  younger
         children and the infants born to school girls;


       *    the Department's investigation into the desirability  of  single
         sex government schools and  the  possibility  of  teaching  certain
         subjects separately to boys and girls;


       *    the development of gender sensitive textbooks and  curricula,118
         as well as the development of comprehensive age-sensitive  sex  and
         sexual health education;


       *    the Department's efforts to improve  the  education  and  Matric
         pass rates and to decrease the dropout rate  of  girls,  especially
         rural African and coloured girls.

23.   THE BUDGET AND ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES


  (a) CEDAW stipulates  that  government  should  include  in  its  budgets
       adequate resources for its activities relating to the elimination  of
       violence against women.119


  (b) At a cabinet meeting in 1996, the  Department  of  Finance  committed
       itself to considering the reallocation  of  military  expenditure  to
       support women's economic advancement. In  1992/1993,  the  Department
       reduced expenditure  on  Defence  from  9,1  %  of  total  government
       spending to 5,7% in 1997/1998. Spending on social services  increased
       from 43,8% in 1992/1993 to 46,9% in 1997/1998.120


  (c) In its  Second  Annual  Report  (January  1998  -  March  1999),  the
       Committee recorded its formal questions to the  Minister  of  Finance
       on, inter alia, progress on the Ministry's 1996 Cabinet commitment to
       reduce military  expenditure  and  to  utilise  the  savings  towards
       women's empowerment. The report further records that, in  a  briefing
       on 16 March 1998, the Minister indicated that military  spending  had
       decreased from 4,5% of GDP in 1993-1994 to  1,5%  in  1999-2000,  and
       that the main beneficiaries of this decrease had been the Departments
       of Health, Education and Welfare.121
  (d) Yet in the 1999 Medium Term  Budget  Policy  Statement,  the  average
       annual growth in present and projected proportional  expenditure  for
       Defence and Intelligence was 14,9%, more than double the  figure  for
       any of the other services, including Education, Health  and  Welfare.
       "Strong growth in protection services over the  medium  term  largely
       reflects additional defence spending of R2,8 billion in  2000/01  and
       R3,8 billion in 2001/02 on the strategic procurement package."


  (e) The Department of Finance was invited by the Committee to  present  a
       submission at the hearings. Although  Deputy  Minister  attended  the
       hearings, he advised the Committee that the Department had  not  been
       able to prepare a submission to the Committee. To date, the Committee
       also has not  received  a  response  to  questions  posed  to  Deputy
       Minister at the hearings.


  (f) The Committee requires an urgent  response  from  the  Department  of
       Finance on, amongst others:-


       *    the Department's efforts to redress the  unemployment  of  women
         formerly employed in the clothing and textile industries caused  by
         the liberalisation  of  trade  policy  as  a  means  of  increasing
         international competitiveness in the manufacturing sector
  (g) Various projects in the NCPS Victim Empowerment Programme (VEP)  were
       intended to focus on issues relating to violence  against  women  and
       children. As will appear below,  very  few  of  these  projects  have
       sustainable funding, and many of the projects were only  intended  to
       operate for one year:-


       *    "Multi-disciplinary Management  of  Child  Abuse  and  Neglect":
         Donor funding  of  R2  million  paid  for  the  1998/1999  year  of
         operation; for the 1999-2001 years, "alternate sources of  funding"
         would be sought during 1998.122
       *    Primary Health Care Model to Reduce the Risk  of  Inter-personal
         Violence": This was only intended to be a one-year project,  to  be
         implemented during 1998/1999, with  funding  of  R400  000  sourced
         from the VEP.123


       *    Violence Referral Centres" -  a  pilot  programme  to  establish
         "Violence Referral Management centres in four provinces,  receiving
         referrals from frontline staff": This project  was  similarly  only
         intended to  be  a  one-year  project,  to  be  implemented  during
         1998/1999 at a cost of R510 000, funded by the VEP.124


       *    Outreach Centres to Counter-act Domestic Violence" - a programme
         designed to give support for the establishment of outreach  centres
         in provinces to expand services to victims  of  domestic  violence:
         Donor funding of R1,2 million paid for the implementation  of  this
         project in Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape,  whilst  the  VEP  paid
         R1,2 million for its implementation in North-West Province and  the
         Free State. The VEP would pay R3 million for its implementation  in
         the remaining five  provinces  in  2000/2001.  "Alternate  funding"
         would be sought during 1998 for the continued  operation  of  these
         programmes.125


       *    65 000 was budgeted from the VEP for "Access to Legal Provisions
         to Counter-act Domestic Violence in Rural Communities",  a  project
         only intended to be operational during 1998/1999.126


       *    Violence Prevention in Schools", a project  implemented  by  the
         Department of  Health  (in  conjunction  with  the  US  Centre  for
         Disease Control) for the 1998/1999 year  at  a  cost  of  R65  000,
         funded by the VEP.127


       *    National Policy Guidelines on Victims of Sexual  Offences"  -  a
         project encompassing nine provincial  workshops  to  train  service
         providers on the basis of the national policy guidelines on  sexual
         offences: this project was funded by the VEP at a cost of R150  000
         during 1998/1999.128


       *    Victim Empowerment in Schools - Life  Skills  Curriculum":  this
         project was funded by the VEP at a cost of R150 000,  and  intended
         to be a one-year project during 1998/1999.129
       *    the VEP paid  for  a  training  course  for  the  SAPS  entitled
         "Victims of Violence: Domestic Violence and  Sexual  Offences  Case
         Handling Training" at a cost of R100  000  for  1998/1999;  funding
         for 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 "to be secured in order  to  extend  to
         these two years".130


       *    an information  and  public  awareness  project  hosted  by  the
         Department of Welfare, funded until 2001 by the VEP.131


  (h) In its  Second  Annual  Report  (January  1998  -  March  1999),  the
       Committee reported that no specific budgetary  allocations  had  been
       made  for  violence  against  women,  unlike  other  crimes  declared
       priority crimes in terms of the NCPS, such as  hijacking.  Similarly,
       departments such as  Safety  and  Security  did  not  have  specific,
       separate budgetary allocations for violence against women.


  (i) The exclusion of victims of  domestic  violence  from  the  Fund  for
       Victims of Violent Crime Bill132.


  (j) The Commission for Gender Equality also raised the issue of involving
       the private sector in programmes addressing violence  against  women.
       An example of such involvement, which is  accessible  and  effective,
       the private sector could assist in  establishing  shelters  and  safe
       houses for victims of violence.


  (k) Various submissions133 to the Committee mentioned that  the  cost  of
       violence against women  in  South  Africa,  and  especially  domestic
       violence, has never been calculated due to ineffective  documentation
       of these incidents by the health and criminal  justice  sectors.  Yet
       even with loose indicators of the frequency and  extent  of  violence
       against women, it is apparent  that  it  has  a  staggering  economic
       impact on our health, welfare, policing and justice resources. A 1994
       study undertaken by the Health Maintenance  Organisation  found  that
       women who have been raped or beaten had medical costs two and a  half
       times higher than those who were not victimised.


  (l) By way of example,  CERSA  reported  that  the  number  of  treatment
       episodes in one year as a result of abuse by  partner  or  ex-partner
       was 121 000 in the Eastern Cape, 74 294 in Mpumalanga and 93  868  in
       the Northern Province.134


  (m) These costs are both public and private, paid for by women and  their
       families (medical care, accommodation, travel, direct  income,  child
       care, serious injury,  loss  of  property  and  non-monetary  costs).
       Health costs carried by the state include doctors, nurses,  emergency
       wards, clinics, mental health services, justice costs include police,
       courts and correctional services;  in  the  social  services  sector,
       welfare, housing and child care.  Employers  also  pay  for  violence
       against women in the form of high absenteeism and lower productivity.


  (n) Calculating the real economic costs may be hampered by the fact  that
       violence against women is under-reported, prenatal damage  caused  by
       the abuse of pregnant  women  if  difficult  to  quantify,  long-term
       consequences  such  as  intergenerational   transfers   of   violence
       behaviour cannot be accurately estimated and private costs  to  women
       cannot be captured.135

24.   NTER-MINISTERIAL CO-OPERATION AND CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE


  (a) The National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS), adopted by the Cabinet
       in  May  1996,  is  the  government's   flagship   inter-departmental
       programme in its efforts to combat crime. One of the  NCPS  programme
       which  affects  issues  of  violence  against  women  is  the  Victim
       Empowerment Programme, hosted by the core  NCPS  departments,  namely
       Justice, Welfare,  the  SAPS,  Safety  &  Security  and  Correctional
       Services, but also involves the departments of Health and  Education,
       and provincial departments.136


  (b) R1,5 million of the OSW's funding of R2,5 million for  1998/1999  was
       donor funding, which  terminated  in  August  1999.  The  budget  for
       1999/2000 only covers salaries and administration.137


  (c) During 1999, the OSW advised the Committee that it was  developing  a
       green paper on a national gender policy to be passed  by  Cabinet  in
       1998. This policy document was not finalised by the OSW during  1998.
       On 15 March 1999, Deputy Minister Essop Pahad and the director of the
       OSW, Dr Ellen Kornegay, advised the Committee that a  draft  national
       gender document  had  been  completed  and  was  undergoing  internal
       review, to be realised as a green paper.


  (d) On 15 March 1999, the OSW also advised  the  Committee  that  it  was
       conducting a gender audit on  internal  transformation  and  external
       service delivery of all government departments and all the provinces,
       with a view to developing a national action plan.


  (e) The Committee requires a  response  from  the  Department  of  Health
       regarding the procedures in  place  to  ensure  that  under-resourced
       provinces  and  local  governments  receive  more   money   for   the
       implementation of both primary health care, as well  as  free  health
       care for pregnant women and children  under  the  age  of  six,  than
       stronger resourced provinces and local governments.138


  (f) Although the Department of Foreign Affairs were not requested by  the
       Committee to participate in the November 1999 hearings, the Committee
       would like to know whether and when a gender desk will be established
       in the Department. The Committee also requires information  regarding
       the Department's efforts to set up international  links  relating  to
       international trafficking in women and prostitution.


  (g) In view of various submissions relating to  women's  difficulties  in
       escaping situations of especially domestic violence due to no  access
       to alternative housing, the Committee also requires a  response  from
       the Departments of Housing and Agriculture and Land Affairs (both  of
       whom were also not requested to participate in the hearings) on their
       efforts to ensure that women are not  discriminated  against  in  the
       granting of housing subsidies, access to rural housing and rural land
       allocation. The Committee is particularly interested in the  progress
       and achievements of the Women for Housing Group in the Department  of
       Housing with reference to their April 1998  draft  document  entitled
       "Guiding  Principles  and  Practices  Relating  to  Women's   Housing
       Issues".139

25.   CO-OPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY


  (a) CEDAW requires government to recognise the importance  of  NGO's,  to
       facilitate and enhance their work and to co-operate with them on  all
       levels.140


  (b) Numerous submissions mentioned the importance  of  an  inter-sectoral
       approach, involving both government and civil society, in  addressing
       violence against women.


  (c) It appears that the National Network on Violence  Against  Women  has
       been most  successful  in  bringing  together  government  and  civil
       society on issues relating to violence against women. The  Department
       of Welfare has formed a partnership  with  the  National  Network  on
       Violence Against Women  since  inception  of  the  Network,  and  the
       Network has received financial and administrative  support  from  the
       Department.141 The Department of  Health  also  participates  in  the
       National Network on Violence Against Women.142


  (d) The Committee was also told of the involvement of organisations  like
       People Opposed to Women Abuse in  programmes  of  the  Department  of
       Correctional Services.


  (e) At the same time, many of the NGO's mentioned their prime  difficulty
       of lack of funding, and that most of their time was  spent  on  fund-
       raising instead of addressing their substantive goals.

26.   THE NEED FOR A STATISTICAL DATABASE


  (a) CEDAW stipulates that the state  should  "promote  research,  collect
       data and compile statistics, especially concerning domestic violence,
       relating to the prevalence of different  forms  of  violence  against
       women and encourage research on the causes, nature,  seriousness  and
       consequences of violence against women and on  the  effectiveness  of
       measures implemented to prevent and redress violence  against  women;
       those statistics and findings of the research will be made public"143


  (b) In South Africa, there has been a  notable  lack  of  community-based
       data and reliable statistics on violence against women and  children,
       its prevalence and epidemiological studies of risk factors.  Most  of
       the research undertaken on violence against women in South Africa has
       been relatively small scale, localised or has focused  on  particular
       sub-groups, e.g. health service users.144


  (c) By way of example, Masimanyane reported that their  research  on  the
       prosecution of sexual offences cases were  made  extremely  difficult
       through the absence  of  any  recordal  system  whatsoever  by  court
       officials, and police dockets and court files which were  incomplete.
       Nisaa also reported that  there  is  no  official  methodology  which
       records how many women phone police  stations  when  they  are  in  a
       crisis or when their lives are endangered. When women  report  abuse,
       domestic violence is recorded as common assault or assault  with  the
       intent to do grievous bodily harm. This difficulty creates a  further
       obstacle in cases of femicide, where  a  long  history  of  abuse  is
       commonly found.


  (d) Nisaa further reported  that  the  disaggregation  of  data  and  the
       devising of protocols around domestic violence may yield better  data
       collection, and that the Department of Safety and  Security  is  best
       positioned to do this.


  (e) In its 1998 White Paper, the Department of Safety and Security stated
       that it aims to  improve  the  reliability  of  crime  statistics  in
       general145. The Committee will request the Department to  furnish  it
       with a progress report in this regard.

27.   RECOMMENDATIONS AND QUERIES TO GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS


  (a) Criminal justice


       The Committee recommends:


       *    that the availability of and access to legal aid  to  women  who
         are victims of violence be given urgent consideration by the  Legal
         Aid Board and the Department of Justice;146


       *    that urgent attention  be  given  to  the  appointment  of  more
         prosecutors, intermediaries, interpreters and  magistrates147,  and
         that  the  Department  of  Justice  allocate  resources  for   this
         purpose;


       *    that the training of  magistrates  and  prosecutors  in  gender-
         sensitivity, issues relating to gender violence  and  dealing  with
         traumatised witnesses, especially children, be given priority;148


       *    that clerks of the court, who will be the  point  of  entry  for
         complainants in terms of the new Domestic Violence  Act,  be  given
         mandatory training  in  gender  sensitivity  and  the  effects  and
         nature of domestic violence;149


       *    that consideration be given to a more  accessible  court  system
         for women in rural areas;150


       *    that the establishment of more Sexual Offence and Family  Courts
         receive priority;


       *    that rape and sexual offence cases and cases of  crimes  against
         children be dealt with on a separate and continuous  roll  by  both
         the High Court and Magistrate's Courts;151


       *    that attention be given by the Judicial  Service  Commission  to
         sensitivity to gender issues  in  the  appointment  of  High  Court
         judges152, and that judges receive training  in  the  international
         law requirements of CEDAW  and  other  international  human  rights
         instruments153, the nature and effect of  violence  against  women,
         dealing  with  traumatised  victims  and  gender   sensitivity   in
         general154; and


       *    that gun control laws be enforced more strictly.155


  (b) Law enforcement


       The Committee recommends:


       *    that the Department of Safety and Security allocate resources to
         engage the services of experienced trainers  from  reputable  NGO's
         to train members of the police in:


       *    the devastating effect  of  violence  against  women,  including
         domestic violence, which is often treated  by  police  officers  as
         "unimportant";


       *    sensitive treatment of traumatised  survivors  of  rape,  sexual
         assault and violence against women in general;156


       *    the various legal remedies available to survivors  of  violence.
         It  appeared  from  various  submissions  that  complainants  often
         relied on the police for advice on her choice of  remedy.  In  some
         cases, it was reported that  police  try  to  dissuade  women  from
         laying  charges  against   perpetrators   by   stressing   negative
         consequences for  women  if  they  insist  on  the  arrest  of  the
         offender.157


       *    accurate and adequate forensic investigations for the purpose of
         criminal prosecution.158


       *    that more female police officers be  made  available  to  assist
         survivors of violence159;


       *    that the Department of Safety and Security allocate resources to
         establish a proper surveillance and data  collection  system  which
         would make it possible, inter alia, to identify specific  locations
         where attacks on women regularly occur and to identify reasons  for
         the non-prosecution of violence against women;160


       *    that more police stations be established and equipped, including
         satellite police stations,  especially  in  the  rural  and  poorer
         areas;161


       *     that  urgent  attention  be  given  to  more   visible   street
         policing162 and street lighting.163


  (c) Welfare services and shelters


       The Committee recommends:


       *    that the Department of Welfare embarks on extensive training  of
         its officials to equip them to  deal  with  survivors  of  violence
         against women164;


       *    that both government and civil society give urgent attention  to
         the establishment of shelters for abused  women.  This  is  also  a
         project in which  the  private  sector  can  make  a  specific  and
         greatly needed  contribution  towards  assisting  women  to  remove
         themselves and their children from situations of violence.165


  (d) Health care


       The Committee recommends:


       *    the incorporation  of  treatment  of  the  survivors  of  sexual
         violence and other violence against women  in  the  curriculum  for
         the training of doctors, nurses  and  other  health  workers.  Such
         treatment must also incorporate  an  understanding  of  the  trauma
         experienced by the survivor;166


       *    that urgent attention be given to the availability of  treatment
         of rape survivors of STD's and other health  risks,  and  that  the
         Department of Health prioritises establishing the effectiveness  of
         anti-retroviral drugs like AZT for rape survivors;


       *    that urgent attention be given to women's access to health care,
         especially rural women;


       *    that priority be given to the expansion of the existing  project
         for the training of forensic nurses;  and


       *    that the removal of question 11(e) from Form J88 be considered.


  (e) Incarceration of offenders
       The Committee recommends that:-


       *     the  Department  investigates  the  implementation  of  weekend
         incarceration, especially of perpetrators of domestic violence;167


       *    a fund be created to which victims or  relatives  can  apply  to
         fund expenses related to attending parole hearings;168


       *    a fund be created to assist  prisoners  who  become  victims  of
         violence.169


  (f) Public awareness and education


       The Committee recommends:


       *    an extensive public awareness campaign in all languages  through
         the use of electronic and print media about the right of  women  to
         be free of violence. Such campaign  must  address  both  women  and
         men, and must also target rural areas in an accessible way.  It  is
         also imperative that community organisations, especially  religious
         organisations, are involved in the campaign on  an  on-going  basis
         and  that  influential   people   in   the   community   (including
         politicians,  religious  leaders,  business   leaders   and   youth
         organisations)  on  national,  provincial  and  local  level,  make
         public statements in support of the campaign170;


       *    that  the  Department  of  Justice  drives  a  public  education
         campaign focussing on legal remedies available  to  women  who  are
         victims of violence,  and  in  particular  the  provisions  of  the
         Domestic Violence Act;171
       *    proper education on sex, sexual health, the  crime  of  violence
         against  women  and  alternative  conflict  resolution   mechanisms
         (other than violence) -


       *    as part of the school curriculum, taught at  an  age-appropriate
         level from an early age.  Such programmes must also  focus  on  the
         development of self-reliance and self-esteem  for  both  girls  and
         boys.172  Attention also need to be given  to  teacher-training  to
         ensure that teachers feel qualified to deliver such education173;


       *    for parents  by  way  of  national  workshops  and  seminars  on
         parenting skills174; and


       *     for  men  through  employee's  organisations   and   unions.175
         Changing men's  perceptions  should  receive  high  priority  as  a
         mainstream issue, and provision should be  made  for  both  primary
         prevention as well as secondary  prevention,  such  as  counselling
         programmes for abusers;176  and
       *    in communities by representatives of  the  police,  welfare  and
         legal services177, utilising  the  network  of  as  many  community
         organisations  as  possible,   including   women's   organisations,
         specifically to reach  women  who  have  already  left  school  and
         unemployed men.


       *     Such  education  should  address,  inter  alia,  the  following
         questions178:


         *  What is love?  In what ways can it be demonstrated?


         *  What do young people do sexually? Why do people have sex?
         *  Do men and women have equal sexual rights?


         *  What kinds of relationship can young people have?
         *  What alternative sexual practices are there?


         *  How can men and women communicate about sexual matters?


         *  Who can say no to sex, and how? Who can ask for it?
         *  Who has or is allowed to  have  multiple  sexual  partners?  And
           why?


         *  What is sexual abuse and violence?


         *  When and why does violence occur within relationships?


         *  Is violence acceptable within relationships?


         *  How can potentially violent situations be dealt with?


  (g) It appeared from numerous submissions that the lack of employment and
       realisable aspirations among especially young men contributed towards
       abuse of women through displacement of frustrations  onto  vulnerable
       partners, as well as through increased  drug  and  alcohol  use.  The
       Committee  therefore  recommends  that  government  prioritises   job
       creation in areas where abuse is most prevalent.179

The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of  Quality  of  Life  and
Status of Women's: Additions to the Report on  the  Violence  Against  Women
Hearings - February 2001

The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Quality of Life and  Status  of  Women
held public hearings on Violence Against Women in November 1999. The  report
(of February 2000) does not include recommendations by the Committee on  the
issues covered below. The Committee recommends the
following inclusions:


  13.8     The budget and allocation of resources


           The committee recommends that:


       13.8.1          Government prioritise resources, both  financial  and
                human,  to  projects  such  as  those  in  the  NCPS  Victim
                Empowerment  Programme  especially  where  it   relates   to
                violence against women and children.


       13.8.2      Separate  budgetary  allocations  be  made  for  violence
                against women in departments such as Safety and Security.


       13.8.3     The Department of Finance ensures that the gender analysis
                of the different department's programmes be reintroduced  in
                the National Budget.


  13.9     Inter-ministerial co-operation and co-operative governance


           The committee recommends that:


       13.9.1      The  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  makes  a   written
                submission on:-


                13.9.1.1      The  development  of  a  gender  desk  in  the
                           department.


                13.9.1.2     The department's programmes and efforts,  which
                           aim  to  curtail  the  international  and  cross-
                           border trafficking of  women  and  children  from
                           South Africa and into South Africa.


                13.9.1.3     What the department's role is together with the
                           Department of Justice in considering  legislation
                           in this regard?


       13.9.2     The Departments of Housing, Agriculture and  Land  Affairs
                provide the Committee with a  report  on  the  progress  and
                achievements  of  the  Women  For  Housing  Group   in   the
                Department of Housing, efforts in ensuring  that  women  are
                not  discriminated  against  in  the  granting  of   housing
                subsidies,  access  to  rural   housing   and   rural   land
                allocation.


  13.10    Co-operation between government and civil society


       13.10.1    Government departments to issue progress  reports  to  the
                Committee on their involvement with NGO's and in particular,
                what funding has been provided to the NGO sector  in  giving
                effect to CEDAW.


  13.11    The need for a statistical database


       13.11.1    The Department of Safety and Security should be  asked  to
                ensure that their information on violence against  women  be
                disaggregated in a  more  effective  manner,  which  clearly
                indicates  and  records  data  on  domestic   violence   and
                femicide.

The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of  the  Quality  of  Life
and Status of Women

Summary Report On Violence Against Women

JULY 2001

Introduction

The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of  the  Quality  of  Life
and  Status  of  Women  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Committee)  was
permanently established in June 1998 to monitor and  oversee  progress  with
regard to the improvement of the quality of life  and  status  of  women  in
South Africa. The Committee's specific  brief  is  to  monitor  government's
commitments made at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on  Women  in
Beijing in 1995 and the provisions of the United Nations Convention  on  the
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

The South African  government  signed  and  ratified  CEDAW  and  government
departments tabled their commitments to  the  Beijing  Platform  for  Action
(BPFA) in  February  1996.   Both  CEDAW  and  the  BPFA  detail  a  state's
obligation to  introduce  measures  to  protect  the  rights  of  women  and
mechanisms to eliminate gender-based violence.

The Committee's hearings on violence against women were  held  from  8th  to
17th November 1999. Copies off all written submissions  are  available  from
the Committee clerk. The objectives of the hearings were the following: -
  *   To identify what and where the blockages are which impede  women  who
       have been victims of all forms of violence, from access  to  justice;
       and
  *   To determine the varied ways in which such obstacles to  justice  can
       be addressed and eliminated.

This summary report will detail the following:


  *   An overview of the critical points raised in the submissions  at  the
       hearings, November 1999.
  *   To track the changes after the November 1999 hearings within  various
       sectors dealing with aspects of violence against women.

An Overview - Violence against Women Hearings, November 1999
The  detailed  report  discussed  violence  against  women,   with   special
reference to the submissions made at the hearings, under the headings:


  *   Criminal Justice
  *   Law Enforcement
  *   Welfare Services and Shelter
  *   Health Care
  *   Incarceration of Offenders
  *   Recent Research on Violence against Women
  *   Public Awareness and Education
  *   Allocation of Financial Resources and the Budget

Achievements of South Africa in Working Toward the Elimination  of  Violence
against Women

Criminal Justice

New and Proposed Legislation and its Implementation
New Legislation


  *   The Domestic Violence Act (DVA) (Act No. 116 of 1998) which  repeales
       some sections of the Prevention of Family Violence Act (Act  No.  133
       of 1993).
  *   The Criminal Procedure Act, which limits the  granting  of  bail  for
       persons accused of committing serious offences,  which  include  rape
       and which also makes provision for minimum sentences for  murder  and
       rape with aggravating circumstances.

Proposed Legislation
The South African Law Commission's (SALC) Sexual Offences  Discussion  Paper
incorporates a proposed Sexual Offences Bill which extends  the  common  law
definition of rape to include 'unlawful sexual penetration'  under  coercive
circumstances. The  proposed  legislation  provides  that  marriage  do  not
constitute a defence to rape.  Also, consent does not constitute  a  defence
in:


  (a) Sexual molestation.
  (b) Sexual offences against mentally impaired persons.
  (c) Child prostitution.

The  move  away  from  'without  consent'  to  'coercive  circumstances'  is
considered by many as progressive.

SALC has also produced a discussion  paper  on  procedural  aspects  of  the
prosecution of sexual offences, which include the cautionary rule,  evidence
of previous sexual reconciliation history of complainant.

Specific Impediments to the Implementation  of  the  Domestic  Violence  Act
(DVA) and Issues Pertaining to Sexual Offences - Submissions180

The following crucial points were raised at the Hearings of  the  Committee,
in written and oral form. It must be pointed  out  that  the  hearings  were
held before the implementation of the DVA (December  1999)  and  that  these
submissions highlight the perceived  problems  that  could  be  encountered.
These were:


  *   Women's inability to access their rights due  to  lack  of  knowledge
       around the DVA.
  *   Discretion of magistrates in sentencing procedures.
  *   Legal representation is too costly and  so  disadvantages  many  poor
       women.
  *   Education for the judiciary, for example,  clerks  of  the  court  is
       inadequate.
  *   Inaccessibility to  police  stations  and  courts  due  to  transport
       problems make it difficult for women to report and follow-up and thus
       recourse to the DVA would not fully be utilised.
  *   Whilst  the  legal  aspects  of  the  DVA  are  technically  correct,
       activists argue that support mechanisms to ensure the eradication  of
       domestic violence is lacking.
  *   Misconception around domestic violence even amongst victims as it  is
       still viewed as a "private family matter".
  *   Language barriers and staff shortages  further  exacerbate  the  full
       implementation of the DVA.
  *   Confusion around whether social workers  or  police  officers  inform
       victims of their rights.
  *   The 13 forms required to implement the DVA were still not printed.
  *   Producing proof  for  exemption  to  pay  for  protection  orders  is
       cumbersome.
  *   Infrastructure to break the cycle of violence is lacking.
  *   Department of Justice: consulting all role players is time consuming;
       lack of policy statements and implementation strategy will delay  the
       implementation of the DVA, increase in workload  may  result  in  bad
       service  delivery  and  will  have  detrimental  effects  on   gender
       violence. Infrastructure, support structures and  security  is  still
       lacking.
  *   Functioning of Existing Courts and Establishment of Special Courts:


       (a)  Negative experiences of courts in  general  which  is  a  direct
           consequence of a lack of adequate facilities and human resources
           to handle victims of gender violence, massive backlogs of  cases
           which causes delays of 9 months between date  of  complaint  and
           trial.
       (b)  Communication breakdown.
       (c)  Inadequate transport to hospitals, courts and police stations.
       (d)  Reluctance of medical examiners to appear in court.
       (e)  Victims waiting in the same hallways as assailants.
       (f)  Dockets being lost.
       (g)  Victims not notified of assailant's bail hearing.
       (h)  Failure of Sheriffs to serve interdicts in  informal  and  rural
           areas.
       (i)  Two permanent magistrates in the Sexual  Offences  Court  raised
           the following concerns:


         *  A reconsideration of the adversarial system in  sexual  offences
           cases.
         *  A re-examination of strict rules of evidence in sexual  offences
           cases, and cautionary rules.
         *  Children should testify through an intermediary.
         *  Section 170A should be  amended  to  include  mentally  impaired
           persons under 18 years.
         *  'Undue mental stress' is difficult to determine.
         *  Section 51(3) of the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act  regarding
           minimum sentences as well as Section 158 of the CPA which allows
           witnesses not to give evidence in the presence of  the  accused,
           is difficult to interpret.

In response  to  the  concerns  raised  above,  the  Department  of  Justice
provided the following input for more efficient service provisions.


  *   They were finalising a Customer Service Charter for court users.
  *   A service delivery plan was underway.
  *   A Victims Rights Charter was developed.
  *   Various information campaigns for court users, including the 16  Days
       of Activism  Campaign,  which  incorporates  the  issue  of  Violence
       against Women, were initiated.
  *   Using the information from  the  Canadian  Study  Tour  to  focus  on
       lessons learnt there, such as an  inter-sectoral  approach,  economic
       empowerment   of   women,   survivor   counselling    and    offender
       rehabilitation, and shelters and safe houses for victims.
  *   Specialised Family Courts are already operating as  pilot  courts  in
       Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Johannesburg and  Lebowakgomo  and
       these handle domestic violence cases.
      The Department plans  to  establish  20  additional  Sexual  Offences
       Courts within 2 years.

On the 1 December 1999, the Director of Public Prosecutions reported that  a
Special High Court concentrating only on rape cases will be  established  in
Mdantsane.

31.   Court Clerks, Interpreters, Prosecutors and Magistrates

Functions of Court Clerks - organisers and facilitators  of  case  rolls  at
courts are the primary assistants to applicants  for  protection  orders  in
terms of the DVA.

The concerns raised with regard to the above were:


  (a) Prosecutors needed to give better technical assistance and support to
       women.
  (b) High turnovers of prosecutors that were on leave  and/or  transferred
       to other courts impact negatively on gender violence.
  (c) Prosecutors  are  ill-prepared  because  of  workloads  and  lack  of
       resources.
  (d) No hearings for violations of interdicts.
  (e) Magistrates and prosecutors need training  on  non-legal  aspects  of
       rape.

In response to the above concerns, various departments commented on how  the
process was being addressed. The President of the  Regional  Court  for  the
Western Cape reported a system  of  "court  nags"  has  been  introduced  to
ensure court cases run on time and to telephone witnesses  and  role-players
two weeks prior to trail dates. The  Department  of  Justice  reported  that
they are  in  the  process  of  establishing  pre-trial  services  to  alert
prosecutors  and  magistrates  of  previous  convictions  and   arrests   of
offenders. The Head of Sexual Offences and Community Affairs in  the  Office
of the Director of Public Prosecutions reported  that  60  prosecutors  were
undergoing training which includes:
  (a) Collection of evidence.
  (b) Presentation of DNA evidence.
  (c) Cross-examination skills and sensitivity in dealing with witnesses.
  (d) Framing of age appropriate questions.
  (e) Also proposed that a coalition between NGOs, police  and  prosecutors
       should be  formed  to  provide  counsellors  and  intermediaries  for
       traumatised witnesses.

The Chief Director of the Justice  College  reported  that  magistrates  and
prosecutors are undergoing training in sexual offences, child law,  domestic
violence, violence against women, basic  human  rights  and  social  context
training.

32.   The Judiciary

The Committee expressed concern about inappropriate  sentences  handed  down
by High Court Judges and  implications  of  statements  in  rape  cases  and
violence against women. Concern  was  expressed  about  views  of  judiciary
which reflect stereotypes and suggestion of women  collaborating  in  crimes
against them. Further  concern  was  raised  around  the  interpretation  of
recent amendments to  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  which  deals  with  the
imposition of a minimum life sentence where the victim is:
  (a) Under 16 years old, is raped by more  than  one  person  acting  with
       common purpose, or where grievous bodily harm is inflicted, save were
       "substantial and compelling circumstances" exist which would  justify
       a less severe sentence. The judicial interpretation of this exception
       has come under scrutiny by women's organisations and the media.

The University of the Western Cape's Law Centre's  Gender  Project  examined
disparities in recent cases and  argued  that  judges  should  consider  the
following factors in 'substantial and compelling circumstances':


  (a) Whether the complainant has been sexually active is irrelevant.
  (b) Whether the complainant and accused  are  acquainted  or  related  is
       irrelevant.
  (c) Whether the complainant sustained any physical injury is irrelevant.
Appeals from the Regional Court and Sexual Offences Courts

2 concerns were raised:


  (a) Increase in the setting aside of convictions  and  the  reduction  of
       sentences on appeal.
  (b) The Director of Public Prosecutions expressed concern  about  lenient
       sentences being handed down where minimum sentences were applicable.

Appointments of Judges and Disciplinary Proceedings

The Chief Justice formulated the criteria for the appointment of judges  and
it became apparent that there is no specific requirement  for  knowledge  on
and sensitivity to issues relating to women and violence against women.  The
Minister of Justice reported that he was canvassing the views  of  judiciary
on new legislation on training, disciplinary and  grievance  proceedings  of
judges.

Education of Judges

Constitutional Court Judge Kate  O'  Reagan  presented  a  reported  on  her
attendance at a judicial colloquim on the application of  human  rights  law
at domestic level. Issues raised were:


  (a) Countries should seek ways to ensure access of women to  the  justice
       system.
  (b) Lawyers, legislators, judges and citizens to recognise the importance
       of and be familiar with international and regional human rights.
  (c) Judicial education for all stakeholders and to  integrate  CEDAW  and
       other human rights instruments into domestic law and decision  making
       to enhance the social, political and  economic  lives  of  women  and
       children.
  (d) Establishment  of  an  international  judicial  education  centre  to
       "assist countries in design, development  and  delivery  of  judicial
       education programmes on international human  rights  instruments  and
       jurisprudence, as well as an international resource centre to  advise
       and assist all stakeholders".
33.   LAW ENFORCEMENT
Previous Commitments and Recommendations

The 1998 White Paper on Safety  and  Security  places  emphasis  on  service
delivery for women who faced secondary victimisation from the  SAPS  in  the
past. Specific guidelines for use at station level have  been  devised.  The
White Paper adheres closely to the initiatives  of  the  Victim  Empowerment
Programme (VEP) under the National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS).

The 1998 report of the  Independent  Complaints  Directorate  (ICD)  on  the
conduct of members of the SAPS provided the following recommendations:


  *   Extensive training programmes for the SAPS to gain  an  understanding
       of the context and nature of violence against women.
  *   A list of organisations that deal with violence against women  should
       be placed at police stations.
  *   The releasing of information to the media should be reviewed.
Present Experience of the SAPS

The  submissions  to  the  Committee  regarding  the  SAPS  highlighted  the
difficulties confronted by women in  accessing  police  stations.  The  most
common categories that emerged strongly in submissions  from  the  NGOs  and
the SAPS were problems of attitude and abuse and operational problems.  (For
a full list of these problems, please refer to the more detailed report).

The following issues still remain to  be  addressed  by  the  Department  of
Safety and Security:-


  *   The development of a profile of rape survivors and perpetrators.
  *   Disciplinary action against members of the SAPS  who  are  themselves
       perpetrators of violence against women.
  *   The technical aptitude of investigating officers in the investigation
       of charges of violence against women; especially rape.
  *   The establishment of specialised units for rape  and  other  violence
       against women and children.
  *   The Department's participation in trauma centres for rape survivors.

Welfare Services and Shelters
Counselling and Shelters

In the White Paper on Social Welfare of 1997, guidelines include  strategies
to counteract all  forms  of  abuse  and  violence  against  women;  support
services for women who have been battered, raped and  sexually  abused;  the
training of police officers, magistrates and criminal justice  personnel  in
the management of violence against women, gender-sensitive welfare  services
and taking into account women's needs as care-givers.

Participants in the Hearings reported the following:


  *   An absence of proper counselling  for  women  who  are  survivors  of
       violence.
  *   Severe lack of temporary  safe  housing  for  women  as  a  means  of
       escaping situations of violence.
  *   Lack of government funding of shelters.
  *    Support  services  such  as  shelters,  financial   support,   legal
       assistance,  police  protection,  access   to   housing,   education,
       training,  employment  opportunities,  psychological  services   were
       essential to assist women to transcend the cycle of violence.
  *   The Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law and  Development  Project,
       UCT, presented their research findings of rural areas in the Southern
       Cape.  These include:


       (a)  Participants reported fear of retaliation,  public  humiliation,
           ostracism by family and friends and little faith in  the  police
           and courts.
       (b)   Women  reported  little  or  no  support  from  family  or  the
           community.
       (c)  Participants  reported  little  or  no  assistance  from  social
           workers and local welfare agencies.
The Welfare Ministry reported on the  following  achievements  and  proposed
projects:-


  *   A service delivery  for  police  and  other  professionals  has  been
       developed.
  *   "One-stop service" shelters were being planned.
  *   Training of the SAPS and the Department of Justice officials  on  the
       provisions of the DVA. The training of social workers and  volunteers
       would take place in January/February 2000.
  *   Planning of education and awareness campaigns of the DVA.
  *   The Victim Empowerment Programmes (VEP), a key programme of the inter-
       ministerial  National  Crime  Prevention  Strategy  (NCPS)  has  been
       launched.

The following issues remain to be addressed by the Department of Welfare:


  *   The Department's efforts to ensure that women are  not  discriminated
       against with regard to welfare grants and properly regarded  as  main
       care providers.
  *   The Department's efforts to ensure the allocation of  more  funds  to
       care dependency grants for seriously impaired children.

34.   Transport


  *    Various  submissions  described  the  difficulties  experienced   by
       especially rural women in accessing health care  and  legal  services
       due to inaccessibility of transport;
  *   Though the Department of Transport was not requested by the Committee
       to participate in the hearings, the Committee intends requesting  the
       Department to furnish it with its formal response  to  the  following
       issues, with reference to  its  White  Paper  on  National  Transport
       Policy of 1996. These are:


       (a)   The  Department's  efforts  to  make  public   transport   more
           accessible and affordable to women, who rely on  these  services
           for access to justice and health care services.
       (b)  The Department's efforts to improve  transport  within  villages
           and towns, as well as transport to and from rural areas.
       (c)  The Department's efforts to ensure the safety of  women  on  the
           public transport system.

35.   Health Care

Medico-Legal Examinations

Various submissions reported on practical difficulties experienced with  the
required medico-legal examination of  the  victims  of  sexual  assault  and
rape:


  *    Health  care  services  are   disproportionately   concentrated   in
       historically white and urban centres.
  *   A concomitant lack of access, mainly transport, especially for  rural
       women.
  *   Lengthy waiting periods between reporting the crime to the police and
       the medical  examination,  which  not  only  compounds  the  victim's
       trauma, but is also a deterrent to proceedings with criminal charges.
  *   A lack of privacy during the medical examination and a failure on the
       part of district surgeons to explain the reasons for  and  nature  of
       the examination. This is often due to linguistic problems.
  *   Inadequate treatment for  conditions  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  STD's  and
       pregnancy, or treatment without even the most basic  of  explanations
       of the health risks faced by rape survivors.
  *   The President of the Regional Court in  the  Western  Cape  told  the
       Committee that district surgeons often lack expertise and  equipment.
       There have also been cases where district surgeons  have  refused  to
       examine drunk and drugged victims.
  *   Reluctance on the part of district surgeons to appear in court;
  *   Suggestions that district surgeons  deliberately  completed  the  J88
       forms in an inadequate manner to avoid being called as a witness.

36.    Physical  and  Psychological  Aspects  of  Treatment  of  Victims  of
      Violence


  *   It further appeared  that  few  health  care  workers  were  properly
       equipped to deal with both the physical and psychological aspects  of
       the treatment of women and children who  were  victims  of  violence,
       especially sexual violence.
  *   The  Women's  Health  Project  reported  that  most  of  the  general
       practitioners surveyed by them felt inadequate in coping with  issues
       surrounding domestic violence.
  *   District surgeons  and  hospitals  were  only  concerned  about  rape
       victims when the survivor showed physical injuries.
  *   It also appeared that health workers  were  perfectly  positioned  to
       assist women who are victims of violence, with a  majority  of  women
       informing the health care worker who treats them of the  identity  of
       their abuser.
  *   Many health workers, however, are not trained to deal with issues  of
       violence and an education and counselling  opportunity  is  therefore
       missed.
  *   In the Department of Health's 1998 Progress Report to the  Committee,
       the Department stated that it had joined other countries to discuss a
       resolution on the prevention of violence as a public health priority,
       that it participates in the  National  Network  on  Violence  against
       Women and that it assisted in developing guidelines for survivors  of
       sexual offences.

The following issues remain to be addressed by the Department of Health:


  *   The necessity of shifting the focus of health care services for women
       from childbearing to reproductive health, including  counselling  and
       education  on  and  treatment  for  reproductive  health,  especially
       infertility, sexually transmitted diseases  and  especially  violence
       against women.
  *   Training and education of health care workers in domestic violence as
       a mainstream health issue.

37.   HIV/AIDS and Violence against Women


  *   Women and children who have been the  victims  of  sexual  abuse  and
       violence face  special  risks  of  contracting  sexually  transmitted
       diseases (STDs) and in particular HIV/AIDS.
  *   The violence and coercion involved in the sexual relationships of  so
       many men and women in South Africa  limit  especially  young  women's
       capacities to protect themselves against HIV/AIDS.
  *   Various perverse myths have arisen during the last decade  connecting
       sex with certain types of women with a cure for AIDS, thereby  adding
       a new dimension to sexual violence against women.
  *   Government funding of the controversial drug AZT. In  an  address  to
       the National Assembly on 16 November 1999, the National  Minister  of
       Health, Dr ME  Tshabalala-Msimang  stated  that  the  government  has
       declined to supply AZT to people infected with  HIV/AIDS  and  people
       who may have been infected through needle-pricks or through rape,  on
       two grounds - affordability and the absence of proper research on the
       possible  harmful  side-effects  of  AZT,  in  particular  its  toxic
       profile.

38.   Incarceration of Offenders


  *   The Department of Correctional Services presented a submission to the
       Committee describing their  extensive  education  and  rehabilitative
       counselling programmes for inmates, and in particular perpetrators of
       sexual violence.
  *   The department reported  on  their  education  programmes  for  women
       inmates (such as programmes on adult basic  education  and  training,
       reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS, parenting skills, stress and
       anger management, alcohol and drug abuse).
  *   The department's policy stipulates  that  mothers  with  infants  and
       young children must be kept in a separate Mother and Child Unit;
  *   It was also reported that the Department now had a programme by which
       all reasonable efforts were made to  notify  victims  of  the  parole
       hearings, and the release or escape of prisoners.
  *   The Department's submission points out that a victim or  relative  is
       responsible to inform the Commissioner of  Correctional  Services  in
       writing of her contact details, change of address and costs  incurred
       to attend the parole board hearings.
  *   The Department also attempts to assist prisoners about to be released
       by way of counselling, accommodation and transport  arrangements  and
       community  integration  programmes  to  assist  prisoners  to  obtain
       employment on release.

39.   RECENT RESEARCH ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

Research reports on violence against women were submitted to the  Committee.
However the limitations  of  the  research,  such  as,  specific  geographic
areas, and generalizations should  be  guarded  against  when  studying  the
findings. These difficulties highlight the necessity for a statistical  data
base on issues relating to violence against women and  children  and  gender
attitudes. A selection of research reports have been placed in this  summary
report. For more details  of  all  research  findings,  please  consult  the
complete report.

40.   SUMMARY OF RESEARCH

1.    UNISA's Institute for Social and Health Sciences presented a  research
   report on rape  surveillance  based  on  district  surgeons'  offices  in
   Johannesburg from January 1996 to December 1998.  It  includes  Hillbrow,
   Lenasia South and Chris Hani Baragwanath medico-legal clinics:


  (a) 51% survivors were between ages 15 and 25.
  (b) 88.3% of rapes were perpetrated by a person of the same race group.
  (c) 58.2% of rapes occurred over  the  weekends,  and  43.7%  took  place
       between 18h01 and 0h00.
  (d) 44.7% survivors were acquainted with their perpetrators.
  (e) Younger victims were more likely to know their perpetrators.
  (f) 31% of rapes were committed in open fields, 29.1%  in  rapists  home,
       and 14.2% in victim's home.
  (g) 73% of rapes were committed by single perpetrator  and  27%  involved
       multiple attackers.
  (h) Weapons were used in 54.9% of  attacks:  mostly  knives  (50.9%)  and
       firearms (35.3%)  In  85.5%  of  cases  weapons  were  used  only  to
       threaten.

2.    UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender, Law and  Development  Project
   research submission undertaken in rural areas in Southern Cape found that
   statistics and dynamics for rape are similar in rural  and  urban  areas,
   but access to justice and support differ enormously. The  study  revealed
   that:


  (a) Rural women experienced and witnessed  injuries  ranging  from  burns
       from boiling water to severe head injuries. Participants stated that,
       in their community, men were "professionals"  in  domestic  violence,
       hitting a woman on her body and not on her face, so that the injuries
       are  not  too  identifiable,  but  when  she  has  been  accused   of
       infidelity, women sustain head and facial injuries "to make her  ugly
       to other men".
  (b)  Participants  listed  domestic  violence,  alcoholism,  under-   and
       unemployment, the rape of women and property crime as major  problems
       in their communities.
  (c) Rape and sexual molestation of children  were  seen  as  the  biggest
       threats to women and girl children in the communities.
  (d) Economic abuse was a notable feature of the research.
  (e) Women listed the following  causes  of  domestic  violence:  Lack  of
       respect for women, problems with children, unemployment  and  alcohol
       abuse, suspicion or jealousy and culture.
  (f) The report also lists the following reasons for the limited access to
       justice for rural women:


   (g)      Economic disempowerment was mentioned as being the single factor
       which prevented women from removing  themselves  from  the  domestic
       violence.
   (h)      Women in rural areas  lack  nearby  services  and  the  cost  of
       transport decreases a woman's ability to leave violent situations or
       even seek information or assistance to deal with the problem.
   (i)      Limited access to state and private health, welfare and  justice
       services results in systemic discrimination by the state  in  almost
       every area of rural women's lives.
   (j)      No accessible houses or shelters for women in rural areas.
   (k)      Fears of community gossip or alienation from  their  communities
       if they seek assistance.
 (l)  Very few development services exist in rural communities.

The combined effects  of  poverty  and  violence  for  rural  women  in  the
Southern Cape create formidable barriers to  women's  equality,  mental  and
physical health, and their full  participation  in  civil  society.  Current
laws contain systemic inequalities, state legal  structures  are  inherently
discriminatory against women and do not meet the needs of rural women.

3.    The Medical Research Council's Centre for Epidemiological Research  in
   South Africa (CERSA) presented three research reports  at  the  hearings.
   ERSA presented a research report on domestic violence based on the  first
   major community-based prevalence  study  conducted  among  women  in  the
   Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and the Northern  Province.  Its  main  findings
   were the following:


  (a) Emotional, financial  and  physical  abuse  are  common  features  of
       relationships and that many women have been raped.
  (b) Physical violence often continues during pregnancy and constitutes an
       important cause of reproductive morbidity.
  (c) Many women are injured by  their  partners  and  considerable  health
       sector resources are expended providing treatment for these injuries.
  (d) Injuries result in costs being incurred in other sectors, notable  to
       the family and the women's community and to employers in the national
       economy.
  (e) Considerable mental distress is associated with abuse.
  (f) There was considerable agreement with  patriarchal  gender  relations
       but women also indicated that  the  prevailing  gender  attitudes  in
       their culture was much more patriarchal than their personal views.
  (g) The report also mentions that  there  was  considerable  disagreement
       amongst the women about the meaning  attached  to  their  culture  to
       customs like lobola, indicating the possibility of popular discussion
       and examination of these traditions.
  (h) Research conducted amongst  pregnant  Xhosa-speaking  adolescents  in
       Khayalitsha initially intended  to  focus  on  contraception,  bodily
       knowledge and pregnancy,  found  that  male  violence  dominated  the
       sexual relationships of these women.


4.    CERSA also reported  on  research  conducted  among  young  people  in
   Umtata. Some of their key findings were the following:


  (a) Physical assault and rape  or  coercive  sex  was  reported  by  many
       participants.
  (b) Violence was used  by  boys  as  a  way  of  imposing  the  rules  of
       relationships and was particularly associated with  girls'  rejection
       of "proposals of love", attempts to end  relationships,  refusals  of
       sex and their actual or suspected infidelity.
  (c) Physical violence was a way of life for not only the  teenagers,  but
       in all community relationships.
  (d)  The  gender  identities  of  the  participants  were   substantially
       constructed in terms of their success in  sexual  relationships,  and
       pursuits of gaining and keeping boy- and girlfriend were overwhelming
       the preoccupation for those young people.
  (e) Neither teachers nor parents made any effort to promote  safe  dating
       or to interfere in the violent activities.

5.     The  1998  South  African  Demographic  and  Health  Survey  reported
   statistics on violence against women that were significantly  lower  than
   those reported by other studies. The  survey  mentions  that  the  under-
   reporting of gender violence is well recognised and should be taken  into
   account in interpreting its results. The Survey also records that one  in
   five currently married women reported economic maltreatment, indicated by
   the regular non-provision of money for food, rent or bills, whilst having
   money for other things.

1.Public Awareness and Education


  *   It emerged strongly from the hearings that rape, sexual  assault  and
       domestic violence are more prevalent in South  African  society  than
       ever recognised and that fear and expectations of violence is  a  way
       of life for many South African women.
  *   The hearings also shattered the common myth  that  the  rapist  is  a
       stranger who lurks in dark alleys.
  *   Submissions  reportedly  mentioned  our  history  of  oppression  and
       disregard for human rights as the context in which  violence  against
       women  flourished,  and  emphasised  the  importance  of   addressing
       violence against women by placing it both  within  a  historical  and
       political perspective and to recognise the influence of apartheid  in
       the present mindset of individuals,  communities  and  society  as  a
       whole.
  *   It was also argued that the division of the people  of  this  country
       according to race contributed to the prevalence of violence  against
       women.
  *   The Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation explored  the
       imbedded patriarchy which contribute to  violence  against  women  in
       South Africa. Imbedded Patriarchy refers to the ideology of  granting
       men power and privilege over women can be  seen  as  the  one  factor
       unifying  South  Africa's  various  cultural   and   ethnic   groups.
       Patriarchy also has severe economic consequences for women,  who  are
       much more likely to be unemployed and without access to any income of
       their own, while men control the allocation of household finances and
       even hamper women's efforts to obtain and  keep  employment,  leaving
       women totally financially dependent.
  *   CERSA also reported deep-rooted patriarchy and a concomitant lack  of
       respect for women, who are  often  seen  as  the  property  of  their
       husbands or father, or communities, as a factor  in  the  scourge  of
       violence against women.
  *   Submissions also mentioned deepening levels of poverty and inequality
       in post-apartheid South Africa, which affects women more as the major
       component of the unemployed in South Africa.
  *   Gendered constructions of male and female sexuality have created  the
       idea that men should be sexually active and women passive and without
       sexual desire. This implies to some men that women need to be  forced
       to have sex in a context where it is  not  acceptable  for  women  to
       indicate her consent.
  *   Research has shown a vast discrepancy in attitudes  to  the  fidelity
       required from men and women. It is acceptable for men  to  have  many
       sexual partners, but  women  are  required  to  be  faithful  to  one
       partner.
  *   A submission also indicated that government  inaction  is  a  factor,
       which contributes to the high level of gender violence in societies.
  *   Submissions also pointed out that, despite its wide-ranging powers to
       educate the public, the media was irresponsible in its  reporting  of
       violence against  women,  perpetuating  stereotypes  and  relying  on
       sensationalism.
  *   Both government submissions and those of NGOs  reported  an  enormous
       lack of understanding of violence against women by the public.
  *   It was also apparent from the submissions that both men and women are
       uninformed about sex and sexual health and women are therefore unable
       to protect themselves and to provide information and support to other
       young women.
  *   Various submissions stressed  the  importance  of  involving  men  in
       programmes on eradicating violence against women.
  *   Although COSATU did not participate in the  hearings,  the  Committee
       Chair has addressed shop stewards  in  the  COSATU  violence  against
       women and HIV/AIDS campaigns. COSATU has produced a  guide  for  shop
       stewards on these issues and is in the process  of  holding  training
       workshops for its shop stewards.


  2.  Department of Education's Initiatives to Address the Issue:


       (a)  In its Gender Equity Task Team Report  (the  GETT  report),  the
         Department of Education  identified  the  following  issues  to  be
         considered and addressed  relating  to  gender-sensitive  education
         and violence against women:


       (b)  Identifying means of correcting gender imbalances in enrolment,
           dropout rates, subject choice, career paths and performance.
         *  The advantages and disadvantages of single sex schools.
         *  Sexism in curricula, textbooks, teaching and guidance;
         *  Sexism, sexual harassment and violence throughout the  education
           system.

The GETT report also lists the following recommendations:


       *    That new legislation should be developed to  make  explicit  the
         legal responsibilities  of  education  authorities  to  uphold  the
         rights of students to be free from discrimination and harassment.
       *    That the National Department  of  Education  should  develop  an
         interim policy on sex and gender based harassment and violence.
       *    That the National  Department  of  Education  should  develop  a
         training package for educational managers on  their  responsibility
         to prevent discrimination,  violence  and  harassment  as  well  as
         curriculum packages which incorporate  learning  about  gender  and
         violence at all levels of education.

The  Minister  of  Education  made  an  oral  submission  to  the  Committee
regarding the Minister and the  Department's  efforts  to  address  violence
against women. The following points were made:


  *   The Department  of  Education's  1997  report  on  Gender  Equity  in
       Education dealt with sex based violence in schools.
  *   The Director-General of Education reported to the Committee that,  in
       their attempts to include sex and gender education in the curriculum,
       they had initially experienced some resistance from sections  of  the
       communities who did not want to expose small children  to  issues  of
       sexuality. It was hoped that the issue could  be  more  appropriately
       addressed under the auspices of Curriculum 2005.
  *   The Minister of Education reported that a gender  Equity  Directorate
       had been established in April 1999, which liases  with  Gender  Focal
       Points in Provincial Departments  through  the  National  Gender  Co-
       Ordination Committee.
  *    The  Education  Department  was  also  preparing   gender   training
       programmes for all national and provincial officials, as  well  as  a
       Mainstreaming Handbook for use by gender officers.
  *   A school-based project on sex-based  and  gender-based  violence  and
       harassment was being developed.

The Committee would like to receive a formal response  from  the  Department
of Education on the following issues:
  *   The Department's  efforts  to  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  not
       isolated to the Gender Equity Unit.
  *   What  programmes  the  Department  is  planning  in  order  to  raise
       awareness about sexism and  violence  against  women  in  educational
       institutions  and  in  particular  the  pre-service  and   in-service
       training of teachers and to raise awareness in the general public.
  *   The provision of extended day care facilities  for  younger  children
       and infants born to school girls.
  *   The Department's investigation into the desirability  of  single  sex
       government schools and the possibility of teaching  certain  subjects
       separately to boys and girls.
  *   The development of gender sensitive textbooks and curricula, as  well
       as the development of comprehensive age-sensitive and  sexual  health
       education.
  *   The Department's efforts to improve the  education  and  Matric  pass
       rates and to decrease the dropout rate  of  girls,  especially  rural
       African and Coloured girls.
Other important theories that  emerged  for  the  perpetuation  of  violence
against women in South Africa noted:


  (a) The intersection of race and gender  oppression  -  examples  of  the
       double burden of oppression borne by  black  women  are  slavery  and
       indentured servitude. Women slaves and their bodies  were  considered
       the property of their owners. A certain  perception  of  how  African
       women should be treated also emerged.
  (b) Changes in the social order - research has shown that an increase  in
       violence against women, and especially sexual violence  often  occurs
       to changes in the social order.
  (c) Legitimising violence against women -  the  difficulties  created  by
       African traditional and customary law by adhering to customs that are
       oppressive to women.
  (d) Militarisation - the apartheid era militarisation of South Africa and
       the use of violent repression together with  anti-apartheid  movement
       decisions about education and armed reaction have resulted in  entire
       generations of 'lost' and violent young men and a general culture  of
       violence - where violence is seen as a legitimate means  of  conflict
       resolution.


       *    In  addition,  a  culture  was  cultivated  in  which  qualities
         regarded as 'feminine' is treated with contempt as  'weakness'  and
         a  tough,  aggressive,  brutal  and  competitive   masculinity   is
         promoted.
       *     Professor  Jacklyn  Cock  similarly  blamed   the   legacy   of
         militarisation which involves  "a  proliferation  of  weaponry  and
         ideas which link violence to masculinity".

3.    The Budget and Allocation of Resources


  *   At a Cabinet meeting in 1996, the  Department  of  Finance  committed
       itself to considering the reallocation  of  military  expenditure  to
       support women's economic  advancement.  In  1992/93,  the  Department
       reduced expenditure on Defence from 9.1% of total government spending
       to 5.7% in 1997/98. Spending on social services increased from  43.7%
       to 46.9%.
  *   In its Second  Annual  Report  (January,  1998  -  March  1999),  the
       Committee recorded its formal questions to the  Minister  of  Finance
       on, inter alia, progress on the Ministry's 1996  Cabinet  commitments
       to reduce military expenditure and to  utilise  the  savings  towards
       women's empowerment. The report further indicates that, in a briefing
       on 16 March 1998, the Minister indicated that military  spending  had
       decreased from 4.5% of GDP in 1993/94 to 1.5% in 1999/2000, and  that
       the main beneficiaries of this decrease had been the  Departments  of
       Health, Education and Welfare.
  *   Yet in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statements, the  average  annual
       growth in present and projected proportional expenditure for  Defence
       and Intelligence was 14.9%, more than double the figure for any other
       services, including Education, Health and Welfare.
  *   The Department of Finance was invited by  the  Committee  to  present
       submissions at the hearings. Although the  Deputy  Minister  attended
       the hearings, he advised the Committee that the  Department  had  not
       been able to prepare a submission to  the  Committee.  To  date,  the
       Committee has not received a  response  to  questions  posed  to  the
       Deputy Minister at the hearings.
  *   The Committee requires an urgent  response  from  the  Department  of
       Finance on the following issues:


       (a)  The Department's efforts to address the  unemployment  of  women
           formerly employed in the clothing and textile industries  caused
           by the liberalisation of trade policy as a means  of  increasing
           competitiveness in the manufacturing sector.


  *   Various projects in  the  Victim  Empowerment  Programme  (VEP)  were
       intended to focus on issues relating to violence  against  women  and
       children. However,  very  few  of  these  projects  have  sustainable
       funding, and many of the projects were only intended to  operate  for
       one year:


       (b)  "Multi-disciplinary Management of Child  Abuse  and  Neglect"  -
           Donor funding of  R2  million  paid  for  the  1998/99  year  of
           operation,  for  the  1999/2001  years,  "alternate  sources  of
           funding" would be sought.
       (c)  "Primary Health Care Model to Reduce the Risk  of  Interpersonal
           Violence" - this was only intended to be a one-year  project  to
           be implemented during 1998/99, with funding of R400 000  sourced
           from the VEP.
       (d)  "Violence Referral Centres" - a  pilot  programme  to  establish
           "Violence  Referral  Management  Centres  in   four   provinces,
           receiving referrals from  frontline  staff":  This  project  was
           similarly  only  intended  to  be  a  one-year  project  to   be
           implemented during 1998/99 at a cost of R510 000, funded by  the
           VEP.
       (e)  "Outreach Centres to Counteract Domestic Violence" - a programme
           designed to give  support  for  the  establishment  of  outreach
           centres in provinces to expand services to victims  of  domestic
           violence.  Donor  funding  of  R1.2   million   paid   for   the
           implementation of this project in  Mpumalanga  and  the  Eastern
           Cape, whilst the VEP paid R1.2 million for its implementation in
           the North-West Province and the Free State. The VEP would pay R3
           million for its implementation in the remaining  five  provinces
           in 2000/01. "Alternate funding" would be sought during 1998  for
           the continued operation of these programmes.
       (f)  R65  000  was  budgeted  from  the  VEP  for  "Access  to  Legal
           Provisions   to   Counter-Act   Domestic   Violence   in   Rural
           Communities",  a  project  intended  to  be  operational  during
           1998/99.
       (g)  "Violence Prevention in Schools", a project implemented  by  the
           Department of Health (in conjunction  with  the  US  Centre  for
           Disease Control for the 1998/99 year  at  a  cost  of  R65  000,
           funded by the VEP.
       (h)  "National Policy Guidelines on Victims of Sexual Offences"  -  a
           project encompassing nine provincial workshops to train  service
           providers on the basis of  the  national  policy  guidelines  on
           sexual offences - this project was funded by the VEP at  a  cost
           of R150 000 during 1998/99.
       (i)  "Victim Empowerment in Schools - Life Skills Curriculum" -  this
           project was funded by the  VEP  at  a  cost  of  R150  000,  and
           intended to be a one-year project during 1998/99.
       (j)  The VEP paid  for  a  training  course  for  the  SAPS  entitled
           "Victims of Violence: Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Case
           Handling Training", at a cost of R100 000 for  1998/99;  funding
           for 1999/2000 and 2000/01 "to be secured in order to  extend  it
           to these two years".
       (k)  An information  and  public  awareness  project  hosted  by  the
           Department of Welfare, funded until 2001 by the VEP.


  *   In its  Second  Annual  Report  (January  1998  -  March  1999),  the
       Committee reported that no specific budgetary  allocations  had  been
       made  for  violence  against  women,  unlike  other  crimes  declared
       priority crimes in terms of the National Crime  Prevention  Strategy,
       such as hijacking. Similarly, departments such as Safety and Security
       did not have  specific,  separate  budget  allocations  for  violence
       against women.
  *   The exclusion of victims of  domestic  violence  from  the  Fund  for
       Victims of Violent Crime Bill;
  *   The Commission for Gender Equality also raised the issue of involving
       the private sector in programmes addressing violence against women.
  *   Various submissions to the  Committee  mentioned  that  the  cost  of
       violence against women  in  South  Africa,  and  especially  domestic
       violence, has been calculated due  to  ineffective  documentation  of
       these incidents by the health and  criminal  justice  sectors.  These
       costs are both public and  private,  paid  for  by  women  and  their
       families.
  *   Calculating the real economic costs may be hampered by the fact  that
       violence against women is under-reported, prenatal damage  caused  by
       the abuse of pregnant  women  is  difficult  to  quantify,  long-term
       consequences  such  as  inter-generational   transfers   of   violent
       behaviour cannot be accurately estimated and private costs  to  women
       cannot be captured.

4.    Inter-Ministerial Co-Operation and Co-Operative Governance


  *   The National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS), adopted by the Cabinet
       in  May  1996,  is  the  government's   flagship   inter-departmental
       programme in its efforts to combat crime. One of the NCPS  programmes
       which  affects  issues  of  violence  against  women  is  the  Victim
       Empowerment Programme, hosted by the core  NCPS  departments,  namely
       Justice, Welfare, the SAPS,  Safety  and  Security  and  Correctional
       Services, but also involves the Departments of Health  and  Education
       and Provincial Departments;
  *   The Office on the Status  of  Women  (OSW)  was  established  in  the
       President's Office. R1.5 million of the OSW's funding of R2.5 million
       for 1998/99 was donor funding, which terminated in August  1999.  The
       budget for 1999/2000 only covers salaries and administration;
  *   During 1999, the OSW advised the Committee that it was  developing  a
       Green Paper on a National Gender Policy to be passed by the Cabinet.
  *   On 15 March 1999, the OSW also advised  the  Committee  that  it  was
       conducting a gender audit on  internal  transformation  and  external
       service delivery of all government departments and all the provinces,
       with a view to developing a national action plan.
  *   Although the Department of Foreign Affairs was not requested  by  the
       Committee to participate in the November 1999 hearings, the Committee
       would like to know whether and when a gender desk will be established
       in the Department. The Committee also requires information  regarding
       the  Department's  efforts  to  set   up   international   links   to
       international trafficking in women and prostitution.
  *   In view of various submissions relating to  women's  difficulties  in
       escaping situations of especially domestic violence due to a lack  of
       access to alternative housing, the Committee also requires a response
       from the Department of Housing and Agriculture and Land Affairs (both
       of whom were not requested to participate in the hearings)  on  their
       efforts to ensure that women are not  discriminated  against  in  the
       granting of housing subsidies, access to rural housing and rural land
       allocation.  The Committee is particularly interested in the progress
       and achievements of the Women for Housing Group in the Department  of
       Housing with reference to their April 1998 draft  document  entitled,
       "Guiding Principles and Practice Relating to Women's Housing Issues".

5.    Co-Operation between Government and Civil Society


  *   Numerous submissions mentioned the importance  of  an  inter-sectoral
       approach, involving both government and civil society, in  addressing
       violence against women.
  *   The  National  Network  on  Violence  against  Women  has  been  most
       successful in bringing  together  government  and  civil  society  on
       issues relating to violence against women. The Department of  Welfare
       has formed a  partnership  with  the  National  Network  on  Violence
       against  Women  and  the   Network   has   received   financial   and
       administrative support from the Department. The Department of  Health
       also participates in the National Network on Violence against Women.
  *   The Committee was told  of  the  involvement  of  organisations  like
       People Opposed to Women Abuse in  programmes  of  the  Department  of
       Correctional Services.
  *   At the same time, many NGOs mentioned their prime difficulty being  a
       lack of funding, and that most of  their  time  was  spent  on  fund-
       raising instead of addressing their substantive goals.

6.    The Need for a Statistical Database


  *   In South Africa, there has been a  notable  lack  of  community-based
       data and reliable statistics on violence against women and  children,
       its prevalence and epidemiological  studies  of  risk  factors.  Most
       research undertaken on violence against women  in  South  Africa  has
       been relatively small-scale, localised or has focused  on  particular
       sub-groups, e.g. health service users.
  *   Research efforts on the prosecution of  sexual  offences  cases  were
       made extremely difficult through the absence  of  any  record  system
       whatsoever by court officials, and police  dockets  and  court  files
       which were incomplete. Further, there is no official  record  of  how
       many women phone police stations when they are in a  crisis  or  when
       their lives are endangered.
  *   Disaggregation of data and the devising of protocols around  domestic
       violence may yield better data  and  the  Department  of  Safety  and
       Security is best positioned to do this.
  *   In its 1998 White Paper, the Department of Safety and Security stated
       that it aims to  improve  the  reliability  of  crime  statistics  in
       general. The Committee will request the Department to furnish it with
       a progress report in this regard.

Recommendations and Queries to Government Departments (Submissions  to  this
section were received from various  stakeholders  -  please  refer  to  full
document for details)

1.    Criminal Justice

The Committee recommends:


  *   that the availability of and access to legal aid  to  women  who  are
       victims of violence be given urgent consideration by  the  Legal  Aid
       Board and the Department of Justice;
  *    that  urgent  attention  be  given  to  the  appointment   of   more
       prosecutors, intermediaries, interpreters and magistrates,  and  that
       the Department of Justice allocate resources for this purpose;
  *   that clerks of the  court,  who  will  be  the  point  of  entry  for
       complainants in terms of the new  Domestic  Violence  Act,  be  given
       mandatory training in gender sensitivity and the effects  and  nature
       of domestic violence;
  *   that the establishment of  more  Sexual  Offence  and  Family  Courts
       receive priority;
  *   that attention be  given  by  the  Judicial  Service  Commissions  to
       sensitivity to gender issues in the appointment of High Court Judges;
  *   that gun control laws be enforced more strictly.
2.    Law Enforcement

The Committee recommends:


  *   That more female officers be made available to  assist  survivors  of
       violence;
  *   That the Department of Safety  and  Security  allocate  resources  to
       establish a proper surveillance  and  data  collection  system  which
       would make it possible, inter alia, to  identify  specific  locations
       where attacks on women regularly occur and to  identify  reasons  for
       the non-prosecution of violence against women;
  *   That more police stations  be  established  and  equipped,  including
       satellite police stations, especially in the rural and poorer areas;
  *   That urgent attention be given to more visible  street  policing  and
       street lighting;
  *   That the Department of Safety  and  Security  allocate  resources  to
       engage the services of experienced trainers from  reputable  NGOs  to
       train members of the police in:
       (a)  The devastating effect  of  violence  against  women,  including
           domestic violence which is often treated by police  officers  as
           "unimportant";
       (b)  Sensitive treatment of traumatised  survivors  of  rape,  sexual
           assault and violence against women in general;
       (c)  The various legal remedies available to survivors  of  violence.
           It appeared from various  submissions  that  complainants  often
           relied on the police for advice on her choice of remedy. In some
           cases, it was reported that police try to  dissuade  women  from
           laying  charges  against  perpetrators  by  stressing   negative
           consequences for women if they  insist  on  the  arrest  of  the
           offender;
       (d)  Accurate and adequate forensic investigations for the purpose of
           criminal prosecution.

Welfare Services and Shelters
The Committee recommends:


  *   That the Department of Welfare embark on extensive  training  of  its
       officials to equip them to deal with survivors  of  violence  against
       women;
  *   That both government and civil society give urgent attention  to  the
       establishment of shelters for abused women. This is also a project in
       which the private sector can  make  a  specific  and  greatly  needed
       contribution towards assisting women to remove themselves  and  their
       children from situations of violence.

Health Care
The Committee recommends:


  *   The incorporation of treatment of the survivors  of  sexual  violence
       and other violence against women in the curriculum for  the  training
       of doctors, nurses and other health workers. Such treatment must also
       incorporate  an  understanding  of  the  trauma  experienced  by  the
       survivor.
  *   That urgent attention be given to the availability  of  treatment  of
       rape survivors of  STD's  and  other  health  risks,  and  that  the
       Department of Health prioritises establishing the  effectiveness  of
       anti-retroviral drugs like AZT for rape survivors;
  *   That urgent attention be given to  women's  access  to  health  care,
       especially rural women;
  *   That priority be given to the expansion of the existing  project  for
       the training of forensic nurses; and
  *   That the removal of question 11(e) from Form J88 be considered.

Incarceration of Offenders
The Committee recommends that:


  *    The  Department   investigates   the   implementation   of   weekend
       incarceration, especially of perpetrators of domestic violence;
  *   A fund be created to which victims or relatives  can  apply  to  fund
       expenses related to attending parole hearings;
  *   A fund be created to assist prisoners who become victims of violence.

Public Awareness and Education
The Committee recommends that:


  *   An extensive public awareness campaign in all languages  through  the
       use of electronic and print media about the right of women to be free
       of violence. Such campaigns must address both women and men and  must
       target rural areas in an accessible way. It is also  imperative  that
       community  organisations,  especially  religious  organisations,  are
       involved in the campaign on an on-going basis  and  that  influential
       people in the community (including  politicians,  religious  leaders,
       business leaders and youth organisations) on national, provincial and
       local level, make public statements in support of the campaign.
  *   That the Department of Justice drives  a  public  education  campaign
       focussing on legal remedies available to women  who  are  victims  of
       violence, and in particular the provisions of the  Domestic  Violence
       Act.
  *   Proper education on sex, sexual health, the crime of violence against
       women and alternative  conflict  resolution  mechanisms  (other  than
       violence) -


       (a)  As part of the school curriculum, taught at  an  age-appropriate
           level from an early age. Such programmes must also focus on  the
           development of self-reliance and self-esteem for both girls  and
           boys. Attention also need to be  given  to  teacher-training  to
           ensure that teachers feel qualified to deliver such education.
       (b)  For parents  by  way  of  national  workshops  and  seminars  on
           parenting skills.
       (c)  For men through employee's organisations  and  unions.  Changing
           men's perceptions should receive high priority as  a  mainstream
           issue, and provision should be made for both primary  prevention
           as well as secondary prevention, such as counselling  programmes
           for abusers.
       (d)  In communities by representatives of  the  police,  welfare  and
           legal services, utilising  the  network  of  as  many  community
           organisations  as  possible,  including  women's  organisations,
           specifically to reach women who have  already  left  school  and
           unemployed men.

Such education should address, inter alia, the following questions:


       (a)  What is love? In what ways can it be demonstrated?
       (b)  What do young people do sexually? Why do people have sex?
       (c)  Do men and women have equal sexual rights?
       (d)  What kinds of relationship can young people have?
       (e)  What alternative sexual practices are there?
       (f)  How can men and women communicate about sexual matters?
       (g)  Who says no to sex, and how?  Who can ask for it?
       (h)  Who has or is allowed to have multiple sexual partners? And why?
       (i)  What is sexual abuse and violence?
       (j)  When and why does violence occur within relationships?
       (k)  Is violence acceptable within relationships?
       (l)  How can potentially violent situations be dealt with?

It appeared from numerous  submissions  that  the  lack  of  employment  and
realisable aspirations among especially young men contributed towards  abuse
of women though displacement of frustrations onto  vulnerable  partners,  as
well as through increased drug and  alcohol  use.  The  Committee  therefore
recommends that government prioritises job creation in areas where abuse  is
most prevalent.

Tracking the Changes after the November 1999 Hearings

From 2000 to 2001

Visits to various provinces by members of the Committee were  undertaken  in
April and June 2000 with a view to  meet  with  Magistrates,  South  African
Police Services Commissioners and Prosecutors. These  meetings  formed  part
of the Committee's investigation into the difficulties  experienced  by  the
SAPS, Magistrates and Prosecutors in each of the provinces  to  monitor  the
implementation of the National Instruction  on  the  Domestic  Violence  and
Maintenance  Act.   A  delegation  of  the  Committee   visited   Nelspruit,
Mpumalanga on 17 April 2000, Pietersburg, Northern Province on the  19  June
2000, Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape on the  19  June  2000  and  the  Western
Cape.

The issues highlighted below are prevalent to a greater or lesser degree  in
all areas that these investigations took place.

3.    Domestic Violence


  *   Application forms for domestic violence interdicts  -  shorter  forms
       were requested, more staff are required.
  *   Director Singani, Crime  Prevention,  informed  the  delegation  that
       victims are given a choice on whether they want to open a case or get
       a protection order. Normally victims choose the  latter  and  do  not
       want to open a case.  The SAPS need more staff to cope  with  filling
       of the forms.

4.    Public Education


  *   Public is illiterate and uninformed about the legislation.
  *   The public is often referred back to the police by  the  magistrate's
       courts. People get shifted from pillar to  post.  It  is  problematic
       just get more personpower to help with filling in the forms.

5.    Training and Restructuring
  *   Training of police officers is ongoing;
  *   Director  Singani  mentioned  the  possibility  of  getting  a  small
       structure to deal  with  domestic  violence  cases,  because  police
       officials are taken away from their ordinary duties.  The  SAPS  has
       to send two police officers to escort victims,  which  takes  up  to
       five hours. There needs to be a clarification of guidelines  on  the
       division of labour.
  *   Director Singani also indicated that there are no clear guidelines on
       who needs to be doing what, and said that the SAPS cannot  deal  with
       both, but they needed a subsection to deal with the matters.

Note from clerk: it is apparent that even senior SAPS  officers  regard  the
problem of violence against women as something that is  not  part  of  their
ordinary work, but an  extra  burden  placed  on  them.   This  attitude  is
alarming and an undertaking must be obtained from  the  Minister  of  Safety
and  Security  that  this  mater  will  be  dealt   with   immediately   and
effectively.
6.    Manpower and Language
  *   Director Singani pointed out that when the applicant is  referred  to
       the police for assistance with filling in the forms, the police  have
       the problem that they  do  not  have  the  necessary  personpower  to
       assist. He argued that capacity must be built at  magistrate  courts,
       for example, translators must be appointed. He complained  that  they
       only want to deal with the protection side of matters  and  this  can
       only be done if there is more capacity but they do not have the time.

7.    After-Hours Assistance


  *   Director Singani stated there  were  problems  getting  the  required
       assistance after hours with regard to applications. In Sheshego,  the
       magistrates have set certain hours to  deal  with  domestic  violence
       cases, up to 12h00, for instance.
  *   When victims go to the police station to deal with the problem, women
       use interdicts to cover other matters and most cases are withdrawn.
8.    Transport


  *   The SAPS do not have enough vehicles to fulfil its  transport  duties
       toward victims. There was a shortage of manpower  and  members  still
       had to manage their work in the time required. There  was  an  appeal
       that this problem be addressed.

9.    Shelters


  *   Shelters are mostly under the management of  men.  Suspects  complain
       that their wives are given to other men. There is a  perception  that
       this is a cultural matter. Some shelters are not open for 24 hours.

10.   Jurisdiction


  *   The areas of jurisdiction of the SAPS and the magistrate's courts are
       not exactly the same. Police officers often go outside of their  area
       of jurisdiction at times, although a  certain  area  may  be  in  the
       magisterial district. The SAPS has to apply for permission to operate
       outside their jurisdiction, but a senior officer may not be available
       at that crucial time. If jurisdictions could be matched  exactly,  it
       would save on time and labour.

11.   Addresses


  *   Victims or suspects often do not have proper addresses, because  they
       live in rural areas.

12.   Magistrates
Personpower and Language


  *   An official informed the  delegation  that  the  magistrates  in  the
       Northern Province were experiencing the same  problems  as  those  in
       Mpumalanga. They have a shortage of personpower.  His  civil  section
       has three clerks and they do full-time domestic  violence  complaints
       work. On the return  date,  it  often  happens  that  the  respondent
       approaches the court to have the order set  aside.  The  civil  trial
       gets too little attention.
  *   He pointed out that the civil section is chaotic as the three  clerks
       have to fill in all the forms and they experience problems because of
       a language barrier;
  *   Clerks sometimes refer the complainants to  the  SAPS  to  help  with
       filling in the forms. They need more  staff  for  the  completion  of
       forms and for trials. Other sections of work are being neglected;
  *   Over 30 000 documents are served per annum. Domestic violence  places
       another burden on the section.

13.   Restructuring


  *   Additional posts should be created in order to render services;
  *   Many magistrates' offices are using an organogram that  has  been  in
       operation for 30 years - it has not been upgraded.

14.   Financial Implications of the Domestic Violence Act


  *   The Domestic Violence Act has financial  implications  that  has  not
       been accounted for. The sheriff has to be paid and  magistrates  have
       pleaded that the Sheriffs delay  billing  until  the  next  financial
       year.

15.   Prosecutors
Staff


  *   The three divisions - Administration, Prosecution and Magistrates  do
       not communicate. The Act implies that they have certain duties.  Acts
       were passed but due to lack of  additional  staff,  there  are  major
       problems.  Furthermore,  when  cases  have  to  go  to   court,   the
       application is withdrawn and the process is often repeated.
  *    At  times,  the  magistrate  with  civil  court  also   deals   with
       applications for  victims  of  domestic  violence.  The  workload  is
       immense and magistrates themselves need more assistance.

16.   Jurisdiction


  *    The  discrepancies  in  the  jurisdictions  of  the  SAPS  and   the
       magistrates' courts - many  problems  are  encountered  as  the  SAPS
       nearby may want to bring a case before the court but  the  magistrate
       may not act because his jurisdiction is elsewhere.

17.   Inter-Departmental Co-Ordination


  *   There was a request that an  agreement  be  worked  out  between  the
       Departments of Justice and Safety and Security to co-ordinate  cases.
       This will result in a better flow of case. There has to  be  a  joint
       venture between Justice and the police to interrogate the Act and  to
       assist with the smooth running of the implementation.

18.   Problems with Act
  *   The Act makes no provision for cases where violence occurs before the
       interim order has run out and the final order is in place.

19.   Training of SAPS


  *   Members of the SAPS have not received sufficient training with regard
       to domestic violence.

20.   Department of Health and Welfare
Bureaucratic and Practical Stumbling Blocks


  *   In rural areas, there are no specific medical facilities for  victims
       - a clinic is open for certain hours and days.
  *   Medical facilities have been decentralised to be accessed by all;
  *   When domestic violence victims seek help, and  if  they  have  a  J88
       form, they cannot be helped as there may be  no  doctor  present  and
       therefore they will have to go to a hospital.
  *   Victims are often not accompanied as the SAPS do not  have  transport
       or the staff to handle this aspect.
  *   Many rape victims are taken to hospitals where there  is  a  lack  of
       crime kits and other forms, which would be  available  if  they  were
       accompanied.

21.   Statistics


  *   There are only statistics for  rape  victims  and  not  for  domestic
       violence assault, only for assault. A new form is in the  process  of
       being compiled and developed which will  help  record  statistics  to
       separate domestic violence cases from assault cases. This  form  will
       now be filled in at hospitals.

The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of  the  Quality  of  Life
and Status of Women
Summary Report on Violence Against Women
October 2001

Introduction
The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of  the  Quality  of  Life
and  Status  of  Women  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Committee)  was
permanently established in June 1998 to monitor and  oversee  progress  with
regard to the improvement of the quality of life  and  status  of  women  in
South Africa. The Committee's specific  brief  is  to  monitor  government's
commitments made at the United Nations Fourth World  Conference  in  Beijing
in 1995  and  the  provisions  of  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1995.

The South African  government  signed  and  ratified  CEDAW  and  government
departments tabled their commitments  to  the  Beijing  Platform  of  Action
(BPFA)  in  February  1996.  Both  CEDAW  and  the  BPFA  detail  a  state's
obligation to  introduce  measures  to  protect  the  rights  of  women  and
mechanisms to eliminate gender-based violence.

The Committee's hearings on violence against women were  held  from  8th  to
17th November 1999. The objectives of the hearings were the following:
  *   To identify the blockages which impede women's access to justice.
  *   To determine the varied ways in which such obstacles to  justice  can
       be addressed and eliminated.

All submissions of the 1999 hearings are available from the  Clerk  of  this
Committee.

Subsequent to the 1999 hearings,  the  Joint  Monitoring  Committee  on  the
Improvement of the Quality of Life and Status of Women either  initiated  or
participated  in  various  forums  highlighting  gender  violence  in  South
Africa. These were:


  *   The provincial visits to 3 provinces by a delegation from the  JMC  -
       17 April 2000 - Nelsruit, Mpumalanga; 19 June 2000 -  Port  Elizabeth
       and Pietersburg;
  *   The joint 2-day workshop between the JMC and the Public Participatory
       Unit (PPU) of Parliament, 25 - 26 July 2001, Parliament, Cape Town.
  *   The rural road shows held in conjunction with the PPU.

An Overview - Violence against Women Hearings, November 1999

Submissions from the hearings noted the many achievements made by the  state
in addressing and confronting the issue of gender-based violence. The  state
at the highest policy level has  committed  itself  to  the  elimination  of
gender violence. The preamble to the  Domestic  Violence  Act  116  of  1998
makes clear this intention as it sets this  legislation  out  as  "providing
victims with  the  maximum  protection,  which  the  law  can  provide'.  In
addition to the Domestic Violence Act, the  criminal  justice  system  began
the process of transformation  with  proposed  legislation  to  improve  the
lives of women  confronting  the  justice  system.  The  South  African  Law
Commission's  Sexual  Offences  Discussion  Paper  incorporates  a  proposed
Sexual  Offences  Bill.  SALC  has  also  produced  a  discussion  paper  on
procedural aspects of the prosecution of sexual offences.
Specific Impediments to the Implementation of the  Domestic  Violence  (DVA)
and Issues Pertaining to Sexual Offences - Submissions181

The following crucial points were raised at  the  hearings  in  written  and
oral form. It must be pointed out that the hearings  were  held  before  the
implementation of the DVA (December 1999) and  these  submissions  highlight
the perceived problems that would be encountered. These were:


  *   Women's inability to access their rights due  to  lack  of  knowledge
       around the DVA.
  *   Discretion of magistrates in sentencing procedures.
  *   Legal representation is too costly and therefore  disadvantages  many
       poor women.
  *   Education for the judiciary, for example, clerks of  the  court,  are
       inadequate.
  *   Inaccessibility to  police  stations  and  courts  due  to  transport
       problems make it difficult for women to report and follow up and thus
       recourse to the DVA would not be fully utilised.
  *   Whilst  the  legal  aspects  of  the  DVA  are  technically  correct,
       activists argue that support mechanisms to ensure the eradication  of
       domestic violence is lacking.
  *   Misconception around domestic violence even amongst victims is  still
       viewed as a "private family matter".
  *   Language barriers and staff shortages  further  exacerbate  the  full
       implementation of the DVA.
  *   The 13 forms required to implement the DVA were still not printed.
  *   Negative  experiences  of  courts  in  general,  which  is  a  direct
       consequence of a lack of adequate facilities and human  resources  to
       handle victims of gender violence.  There  are  massive  backlogs  of
       cases, which cause delays of about nine months between complaint  and
       trial.
  *   A definite need for the reconsideration of the adversarial system  in
       sexual offences cases.
  *   Prosecutors and magistrates need training  on  non-legal  aspects  of
       gender-based violence.
  *   South Africa should seek ways to ensure that  women  can  access  the
       justice system.

The above were some  of  the  key  concerns  raised  at  the  1999  November
hearings.  For more detail, see the summary report  of  July  2000  and  the
comprehensive report of February 2000.

Key departments and various  stakeholders  involved  in  addressing  gender-
based violence have pointed out the progress that have been  made  in  terms
of programmes,  budgetary  requirements  and  policies  that  will  aid  the
process towards the eradication of gender-based violence. For  a  full  list
of submissions made by key departments, please refer to  the  February  2000
report.

Findings from  provincial  visits  (2000)/workshop  (2001)  and  road  shows
(2001) to monitor the gaps found  in  the  implementation  of  the  Domestic
Violence Act of 1998.

Visits to various provinces by members of the Committee were  undertaken  in
April and June 2000 with a view to meet with magistrates, the South  African
Police Services (SAPS) Commissioners and prosecutors. These meetings  formed
part of the Committee's investigation into the difficulties  experienced  by
the SAPS, magistrates and prosecutors in each of the  provinces  to  monitor
the implementation of the National Instruction on the Domestic Violence  and
Maintenance Act (Act 99 of 1998). A  delegation  of  the  Committee  visited
three provinces and visits to the remaining provinces are envisaged  in  the
year 2002.

Some  of  the  key  concerns  highlighted  by  participants  at  the   above
interactive sessions  revealed  the  following  problems  (to  a  lesser  or
greater degree in different areas) encountered by women "victims"  accessing
the justice system:


  *   Application forms for domestic violence interdicts were too  lengthy.
       Shorter forms were requested.
  *   More staff is required to assist women at various stages.
  *   The public is still illiterate and uninformed about the legislation.
  *    Although  training  of  police  officers  is  ongoing,  there  is  a
       perception among certain SAP officials that violence against women is
       something that is not part of  their  ordinary  work,  but  an  extra
       burden placed on them.
  *   Lack of staff in certain courts and police  stations  further  hamper
       the process.
  *   Language issues and lack of translators  at  some  assistance  points
       were lacking.
  *   There are problems with receiving the required assistance after hours
       with regard to applications.
  *   Lack of vehicles to fulfil duties toward victims.
  *   Shelters for women are mostly under the management of men.
  *   The areas of jurisdiction of the SAPS  and  the  magistrates'  courts
       also pose a problem.
  *   The Domestic Violence Act has financial implications and all  aspects
       have not been fully covered.
  *   The Act makes no provision for cases where violence occurs before the
       interim order has run out and the final order is in place.
  *   In rural areas, there are no specific medical facilities for  victims
       as clinics are only open on certain days and for specific hours.
  *   Rape victims are taken into hospitals where there is a lack of  crime
       kits and the necessary forms required.

Recommendations

Stakeholders from various sectors at the 1999 hearings, the 2000  visits  to
the three provinces and the 2001 road shows and workshop recommended that:


  *   The availability of and access to legal aid to women who are  victims
       of  violence  be  given  urgent  consideration  by  the  stakeholders
       concerned.
  *   Urgent attention be given to increasing staff in key departments that
       work on gender-based violence.
  *   Both government and  civil  society  give  urgent  attention  to  the
       establishment of shelters for abused women. This is also a project in
       which the private sector can  make  a  specific  and  greatly  needed
       contribution.
  *   Urgent attention be given to the availability of  treatment  of  rape
       survivors of STD's and other health risks, and that the Department of
       Health prioritises establishing the effectiveness of  anti-retroviral
       drugs like AZT for rape survivors.
  *   An extensive public awareness campaign be undertaken in all languages
       through the use of electronic and print media  about  the  rights  of
       women to be free of violence. Such campaigns must address both  women
       and men, and must target rural areas in an accessible way.
  *   Proper education on sex, sexual health, the crime of violence against
       women and alternative  conflict  resolution  mechanisms  (other  than
       violence) at all levels in society be done.
  *   Investigate the possibilities of weekend incarceration, especially of
       perpetrators of domestic violence.
  *   Children have emerged as silent witnesses in  domestic  violence.  An
       integrated approach is key to assist women and children to deal  with
       the effects  of  violence.  Support  services  to  assist  women  and
       children should be linked to the courts.
  *   The application forms should be simplified.
  *   The judicial process should allow for women to be debriefed after the
       hearing in order for  her  to  fully  understand  the  terms  of  the
       protection order and how it can facilitate her protection.

Conclusion

The legislative process in terms of  addressing  gender-based  violence  and
increasing  women's  substantive  equality  in  South   Africa   is   highly
commendable if one notes the time- period in which  changes  were  effected.
However, for the cycle of  violence  to  be  broken  in  South  Africa,  the
interlinkages  and  crosscutting  issues  between  violence  against  women,
poverty and HIV/AIDS within the  development  framework  needs  to  be  more
thoroughly scrutinised.

10.   It was decided that this kind of provision is perhaps better and  more
     suitably located within the revised and comprehensive Child Care Act 74
     of 1983.
11.   Though this is comprehensively dealt with in the Labour Relations  Act
     66 of 1995, it means that  people  in  employment  are  protected  from
     sexual harassment. It seems clear that there are other areas where this
     is likely to take place. Thus further investigations and proposals will
     need to be made in this regard.
12.   The Commission on Gender Equality reported to the  Committee  that  it
     was in the process of conducting research on  judgements  on  rape,  as
     well as drafting of sexual offences legislation and  other  legislation
     which impact on women.

In its June  1998  report  on  the  Violence  Against  Women  Hearings,  the
Committee described a submission by Rape  Crisis  and  UWC's  Community  Law
Centre regarding the Namibian draft bill on sexual assault. This bill  dealt
with, inter alia, a redefinition of rape,  minimum  sentences  for  rapists,
order  for  payment  of   compensation   to   the   complainant,   mandatory
commencement  of  rape  trials  within  three  months  of  date  of  arrest,
disallowing a negative inference based solely on the  length  of  the  delay
between the alleged rape and the laying of  a  complaint,  the  right  of  a
complainant to be legally represented during criminal proceedings,  and  the
prohibition of evidence relating to  the  previous  sexual  history  of  the
complainant.

15.   The President of the Regional Court  for  the  Western  Cape  reported
     that there was currently a backlog of 7000 cases in  the  Western  Cape
     regional courts. The present delay  between  complaint  and  trial  was
     approximately 9 months.
16.   The SAPS's submission on its Family  violence,  Child  Protection  and
     Sexual Offences Units specifically mentions the difficulties caused  by
     numerous postponements of cases involving child witnesses, as  well  as
     trauma suffered by a child witness as a result of a postponement.

     March 1999), page 15, initially only 200 copies of the Guidelines  were
     distributed.  When the Committee raised concerns, the Department raised
     donor funding to ensure the printing of sufficient numbers of copies of
     the Guidelines.

     Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences on rape  surveillance
     at the Hillbrow, Lenasia South and Chris Hani Baragwanath  medico-legal
     clinics. This report also found that, in cases of  multiple  attackers,
     the attack was more likely  to  be  perpetrated  by  strangers  to  the
     victim, and in open spaces; single perpetrators  were  more  likely  to
     attack victims they knew and 48,2% of such attacks occurred  in  homes.
     These findings are echoed in the research findings among rural women in
     the Southern Cape by UCT's Institute of Criminology's Gender,  Law  and
     Development Project, which records that, in 55% of the  rapes  reported
     in their study, victims knew the offender by name or by sight.

     received little or no support from family or the community; women  were
     often too scared of retaliation to help other women, and  the  survivor
     feared public humiliation and ostracism by family  and  friends  should
