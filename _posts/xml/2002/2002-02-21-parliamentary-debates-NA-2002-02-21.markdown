          GOOD WISHES TO PARLIAMENTARY OBSERVER MISSION TO ZIMBABWE

                               (Announcement)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!  Before  I  get  to  the  Order  Paper,  as  the
parliamentary observer mission  will  be  departing  for  Zimbabwe  tomorrow
morning, I wish  to  take  this  opportunity  on  behalf  of  the  presiding
officers and the House, to wish the mission well. [Applause.]

We trust that they will conduct themselves in  a  manner  that  will  assist
them to carry out  their  functions.  Should  they  require  any  additional
assistance while they are in Zimbabwe, they should not hesitate  to  contact
us. We will be here and, of course, the  nation  awaits  their  report  with
anticipation.

We should also take this opportunity to express the hope that the people  of
Zimbabwe will be able to carry out their elections in conditions which  will
be conductive to an outcome that will be generally accepted. We really  hope
everything will go well and that our members will come back  not  in  pieces
but in one piece as a delegation.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms M A MOLEBATSI: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Minister Trevor Manuel yesterday delivered a  Budget  that
       performed the seemingly  impossible  feat  of  reducing  taxes  while
       increasing Government expenditure,  which  will  promote  growth  and
       expansion;


  (2) recognises that the additional R5,2 billion over the next three years
       to the Department of Safety and Security and the over R800 million to
       the Department of Justice, which will result in an extra 16 000  more
       policemen and -women, and a streamlined  justice  system  which  will
       dramatically reduce crime;


  (3) acknowledges that the 24% of expenditure allocated  to  education  as
       well as the Umsobomvu Fund will develop the skills base of our people
       and future leaders; and


  (4)  congratulates  Minister  Manuel  and   the   department   on   their
       extraordinary performance.

[Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the decision by the Gauteng government  to  make  nevirapine
       available at all public hospitals in the province;


  (2) notes that, under the leadership of  Tony  Leon  and  the  Democratic
       Alliance, the Western Cape has already implemented a  full  programme
       to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV;


  (3) expresses its dismay and outrage at the reaction of the  Minister  of
       Health and the ANC to the Gauteng announcement; and


  (4) calls on ANC-run provinces to show greater respect for life than  for
       party discipline and make  nevirapine  available  at  all  provincial
       health centres.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with disgust and  contempt  the  news  that  the  Western  Cape
       director, Greg Duncan, responsible  for  the  Arrive  Alive  Campaign
       drove at 205 km/h on  the  so-called  ``death  stretch''  on  the  N1
       highway near Beaufort West;


  (2) further notes that people such as this official  make  a  mockery  of
       honest Government projects aimed at improving safety and the lives of
       the people;


  (3) hopes that proper treatment of this case will prevail to prove to all
       and sundry that law is fair and just and that nobody is above it; and


  (4) believes that setting an example through this official  will  send  a
       strong message that organs of the state, the  courts,  among  others,
       mean business.

[Applause.]

Ms O R KASIENYANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the increases in social spending announced in the Budget  on  20
           February 2002;


       (b)  in particular the  increases  in  social  grants,  with  old-age
           pensions and disability grants being increased to R620  and  the
           child support grant to R130;


       (c)  that this increase, which is above the level  of  the  inflation
           rate,  must  make  a  significant  contribution  to  the  living
           conditions of the millions of recipients of social grants; and


       (d)  that the date of the increases has been  brought  forward  to  1
           April,  which  will  bring  immediate  relief  to  social  grant
           beneficiaries;


  (2) encourages the Government to pursue the target of       extending the
       child      support      grant      to      three      million      of
       the poorest children in our country by the end  of  2003    with  all
       earnesty; and


  (3) expresses its full support for the broader development thrust of this
       year's  Budget  in  terms   of   further   development   of   skills,
       infrastructure and economic opportunities.

[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House notes that the New NP -


  (1) welcomes the decision by  the  Zimbabwe  government  to  reverse  its
       unlawful ban on certain South African journalists;


  (2) congratulates the South African  observer  mission,  Sanef,  and  the
       Department of Foreign Affairs on the sterling  role  they  played  in
       assuring access to the electoral process for the media; and


  (3) demands that President Mugabe removes all obstacles that could hinder
       a free and fair election because Africa in general, and  Zimbabwe  in
       particular, deserve it.

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that job  creation  through  infrastructure  development  is  a
       viable economic alternative, recognised by many economic experts;


  (2)  acknowledges  that,  in  addition,  infrastructure  development  and
       maintenance is a  vital  and  undeniable  prerequisite  for  economic
       growth and investment;


  (3) recognises that social service delivery can only  occur  when  proper
       and effective infrastructure is developed and maintained;


  (4)  further  notes  that  infrastructure  development  and   maintenance
       backlogs in South Africa have reached staggering  levels  in  certain
       regions, and has consistently been neglected for the past decade  and
       more;
  (5) regrets the meagre amount allocated  to  infrastructure  spending  by
       national Government, which translates into a mere  0,6%  of  GDP,  as
       reflected in the newly tabled Budget; and


  (6) calls on the national Government to recognise its  responsibility  to
       create jobs and infrastructure, especially where  capacity  is  still
       lacking to do so at provincial and local government level.

Mr L M KGWELE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that this year's Budget is the second budget in which there are
       substantial increases in funding for education;


  (2) recognises that this  increase  will  enhance  HIV/Aids  life  skills
       programmes in schools, student financial aid and quality education;


  (3) acknowledges that the poverty alleviation thrust in this Budget  will
       result in more children acquiring quality education;


  (4) believes that the massive boost  in  infrastructure  allocation  will
       give meaning to the President's commitment that no child  will  learn
       under a tree; and


  (5) applauds this Budget, which will enable South Africa's youth to  take
       their place in a competitive and productive economy.

Mrs M A SEECO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation the Budget as presented  by  hon  Minister  T
       Manuel;


  (2) applauds Minister Manuel for -


       (a)  highligting the desire to reduce the crime rate in  our  country
           which inhibits economic growth by causing prospective  investors
           to reassess their investments; and


       (b)  his endeavour to pay special  attention  to  critical  areas  of
           concern such as social grants; and


  (3) although no mention was  made  in  regard  to  unemployment  and  the
       creation of wealth, is of the opinion that Rome was not built in  one
       day.

[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on  the  next
sitting day of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the  PAC  believes  in  the  right  of  all  peoples  to  govern
           themselves and therefore affirms the  right  of  the  people  of
           Zimbabwe to control their own destiny;
       (b)  the Zimbabwe elections should serve as a reminder that  Africans
           must not allow themselves to  be  trampled  upon  by  those  who
           intend to perpetuate their domination over the affairs  of  this
           world by keeping the land question  away  from  the  fundamental
           issues of today; and


       (c)  Africa,  dislocated,  dismantled,  and  divided  was  thrown  by
           colonisation into an international economic system in  which  it
           does not control anything;


  (2) believes Zimbabwe is a sovereign state and has the  right  to  assert
       itself, to secure its means of democracy, development and power;


  (3) notes that it is clear the  European  Union  will  not  allow  strong
       leaders to appear in Africa who will explain to Africa the new nature
       of power and what to do with it and that the next cadre of leadership
       in Africa must prepare our African people to  assume  a  position  in
       world power;


     4) further notes that Africa's people are living in a world power where
        Europeans are coming together in the form ...


[Time expired.]

Ms E GANDHI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall  move  on  behalf  of
the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)   the  Greenbury  Primary  School  in  Phoenix,  Durban,  was   a
           vandalised,   dilapidated   school   serving   an   impoverished
           community;


       (b)  in the past three years, through the  selfless  efforts  of  the
           principal, educators, the governing body and parents, the school
           has been turned around;


       (c)  this school recently entered a competition advertised in a local
           newspaper and won; and
  (2) congratulates the school on  winning  a  fully  operational  computer
       centre which they are now sharing with the community,  and  on  their
       initiative,  which  serves  as  an  inspiration  to  the  spirit   of
       Vukuzenzele.

[Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) is shocked at the chaotic state of the Johannesburg  Metro's  billing
       system where -


       (a)  thousands of accounts are never received;


       (b)  payments are credited to wrong accounts; and


       (c)  the call centre set up to deal with problems does not function;


  (2) believes that the growing arrears bill resulting from this chaos  has
       serious consequences for the delivery of services in Johannesburg;


  (3) expresses its disquiet at the ineptitude of the  ANC  mayor  and  his
       executive, who offer nothing but empty promises to ratepayers; and


  (4) calls on the ANC to put delivery ahead  of  party  interests  and  to
       replace incompetent politicians and officials with those willing  and
       able to do the job.

[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move on the  next
sitting day of Parliament:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates Sappi shareholding company on perking up in the face of
       the global economic downturn and increasing  investor  confidence  in
       the business;


  (2) commends its Managing Director, Eugene van  As,  for  his  leadership
       skills which have sustained the company  through  turbulent  business
       times in South Africa and abroad for a considerable length of time;


  (3) appreciates the fact that despite  the  September  11  holocaust  the
       group's  North  American  operations  nevertheless  showed  signs  of
       recovery and future prosperity; and


  (4) calls on all captains of industries to  stand  united  and  reinforce
       investor confidence in the country, in order to increase profits  and
       create jobs for the poor.

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the  former  commander  of  the  people's  army,  uMkhonto
       weSizwe, and the former Minister  of  Defence,  Comrade  Joe  Modise,
       passed away on 26 November 2001;


  (2) believes that Comrade Joe Modise played  an  important  role  in  the
       struggle for the liberation of the people of  South  Africa  and  has
       worked tirelessly in building a non-racial, nonsexist and  democratic
       South Africa;


  (3) commends the  Modise  family  for  providing  the  nation  with  this
       selfless and gallant fighter for freedom; and


  (4) calls on the people to pick  up  the  spear  and  continue  with  the
       struggle to accelerate change in our country.

[Applause.]

Mnr J SCHIPPERS: Mev die Speaker, ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem -


  (1) van president Thabo Mbeki se besluit dat verdere  konsultasie  tussen
       die Departement van Justisie en die SAPD noodsaaklik is  voordat  die
       gewysigde artikel 49 van die Strafproseswet geïmplementeer kan word;
  (2) van die kontroversie en ongelukkigheid onder lede van die SAPD en die
       Departement  van  Veiligheid  en  Sekuriteit  oor  die   voorgestelde
       wysigings; en


  (3) dat die Nuwe NP die voorstel vir verdere konsultasie  tussen  al  die
       rolspelers verwelkom, want reeds met die aanvanklike bekendmaking van
       die voorgestelde wysigings was die  Nuwe  NP  se  standpunt  dat  die
       wetgewing die veiligheid van die polisie in die gedrang sal bring.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J SCHIPPERS: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House notes -


  (1) President Thabo Mbeki's decision that  further  consultation  between
       the Department of Justice  and  the  SAPS  is  essential  before  the
       amended section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Act can be implemented;


  (2) the controversy and unhappiness among members of  the  SAPS  and  the
       Department of Safety and Security about the proposed amendments; and


  (3) the New NP welcomes the proposal for further consultation between all
       the role-players, because at the time of the original announcement of
       the proposed amendments the New NP's position was  already  that  the
       legislation will jeopardise the safety of the police.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of this House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) salutes the many South Africans who are  dedicating  their  lives  to
       dealing with the HIV/Aids pandemic;


  (2) notes with dismay that HIV/Aids remains a subject  of  confusion  and
       argument within the ANC, as illustrated again yesterday when the  ANC
       distanced itself from Premier Shilowa's decision to provide mother-to-
       child treatment;
  (3) laments the manner in which the  ANC's  confusion,  authored  by  its
       leader Thabo Mbeki, is translated into  Government  inaction  in  the
       face of thousands of preventable deaths;


  (4) condemns this continued strategy of the ANC to undermine the  efforts
       of people who are trying to prevent the deaths of thousands of  South
       Africans; and


  (5) calls on the ANC to stop their campaign of madness and make  HIV/Aids
       the priority of all three spheres of government.

                           FESTIVAL OF EID-UL-ADHA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Saturday is the Muslim Festival of Eid-ul-Adha, the second
       most important celebration of Islam, which  marks  the  last  day  of
       Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, as it commemorates the willingness  of
       Ibrahim to sacrifice his son to God; and


  (2) conveys to all Muslims the greetings of this House  and  wishes  them
       "Eid Mubarak".

Agreed to.

          CONDOLENCES TO VICTIMS OF TRAGIC TRAIN ACCIDENT IN EGYPT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and sadness the  tragic  train  accident  in  Egypt,
       resulting in more than 370 deaths;


  (2) shares the sorrow of the Egyptian people;
  (3) offers its condolences to the bereaved; and


  (4) wishes all those injured a speedy recovery.

Agreed to.

                      INTERNATIONAL MOTHER LANGUAGE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  today is International Mother Language Day; and


       (b)  that South Africa is a  multi-language  society,  and  that  the
           multilingual  nature  of  our  society  is  enshrined   in   the
           Constitution;


  (2) recognises that  the  multilingual  nature  of  our  society  is  not
       reflected in the day-to-day reality of our people, where  the  mother
       languages of millions of our citizens are not in use for purposes  of
       education, commerce and governance;


  (3) urges all South Africans to promote the use of all our  languages  in
       commerce, industry, education and governance;


  (4) calls on Government to implement training programmes and professional
       standards  for  interpreters  and  to  provide  extended  access   to
       government communications in all South Africa's languages; and


  (5) undertakes to provide more  extensive  and  effective  interpretation
       services within  Parliament,  to  offer  increased  use  of  all  our
       languages  in  public  participation  programmes  and  to   transform
       Parliament into an institution that leads in  the  promotion  of  our
       country as one  which  respects  and  cherishes  all  our  languages,
       putting none above the other.

Agreed to.
     PROMOTING MOTHER LANGUAGE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND
                   EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT

Mme N M TSHEOLE: Modulasetilo, maloko a a tlotlegang a  Palamente  ya  etsho

re e anyang mo letseleng. (Translation of Tswana paragraphs follows.)

[Ms N M TSHEOLE: Madam Speaker, hon members of Parliament, and our  visitors
who are listening from the gallery, I greet you.
Today we are celebrating, we are  celebrating  the  results  of  the  Unesco
negotiations which started in 1993 about languages. In 1999, Unesco for  the
first time started celebrating the mother tongue, that is the language  that
I was born with, that I acquired from my mother.

It is proper to encourage Unesco as it has thought of making today a day  of
celebrating our mother tongue, the one we have acquired.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Yes, hon Ellis?

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, on a point of order - not that this is  against
what the hon member is saying, because I do not know  what  she  is  saying:
Yet again, there is a very poor interpretation service, so poor  that  there
is, in fact, nothing at all. I am sure that we would all like to  hear  what
the hon member is saying in this very important debate. [Interjections.]

The  DEPUTY  SPEAKER:  Order!  Thank  you,  hon  member,  for  raising  that
important  point.  Can  the  management  please  follow  up  the  issue   of
interpretation. [Interjections.]

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Maybe, in a way, I can say that  I
am  protesting.  I  have  decided  to  speak  in  my  language  to  protest.
[Interjections.] I am going to speak in my language as a  form  of  protest,
because I know that the interpretation system is not in  a  good  condition.
[Applause.] I have often listened to the  interpretation,  and  it  has  not
been good. Even when I know the language that the speaker is using,  I  have
insisted on listening to the interpretation, and the quality is not good.

Today's occasion is the end product of discussions which  have  been  taking
place in the UN. Since 1993 Unesco has been  engaged  in  discussions  about
the significance of a mother language. These discussions culminated  in  the
first celebration of mother language in November 1999.  We  definitely  have
to applaud Unesco for observing 21  February  as  the  International  Mother
Language Day.

One might wonder  why  it  took  the  UN  such  a  long  time,  firstly,  to
acknowledge and recognise the significance of mother  language  to  personal
development, cultural diversity and peace-building; secondly, that at  least
half of the world's 6  000  to  7 000  languages  are  facing  the  risk  of
extinction.  While  we  do  not  want  to  minimise  the   significance   of
organisations that mobilise and  lobby  for  the  protection  of  endangered
animal species, it is surprising that it had to take  the  UN  such  a  long
time to recognise the significance of human communication,  the  only  means
through which human beings can communicate their thoughts.

It is not surprising, though, that the UN had to awaken to the  significance
of mother language, because it is not an exaggeration to say  that  most  of
the world's conflicts have  their  source  in  the  greed  of  the  powerful
nations of the world in not  recognising  the  cultural  identity  of  other
languages.

When I prepared my speech it was with a Setswana mindset, but now I have  to
say this in English. [Interjections.] A nation that is denied  its  language
is a  nation  being  destroyed  or  killed.  Iyanla  Vanzant,  in  her  book
Yesterday, I cried, says:


  In preparing this book I learnt that of all the experiences in  my  life,
  the one that had the most devastating effect was not being celebrated  or
  being made to feel welcome. It was worse than any beating  or  cruelty  I
  experienced.

These are the words from a woman who, as a child, was  so  abused  that  she
grew up into becoming a delinquent who, at the age of 21, had already  given
birth to four children, each with a different father. She is now  an  author
and a motivational speaker.

South  Africa  also  shares  her  experience  of  not  being  celebrated  or
welcomed. I am quoting these words to  show  the  impact  that  neglect  and
rejection can  have  on  a  people.  It  can  have  far-reaching  levels  of
devastation on a people. South Africans,  especially  the  speakers  of  the
other nine official languages, seem to be in a state similar to  the  one  I
described above. Although the Constitution recognises  all  nine  indigenous
languages of South Africa, including sign language ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The interpreters  are  now  available,
if you want to switch over to Setswana.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

[I do not know whether my time will be added to. I was interrupted  all  the
way, because we do not  respect  our  languages.  I  am  saying  this  today
because as Parliament we should be taking care of  our  languages.  We  have
been singing this song since 1994. We are not supposed to speak  our  mother
languages if we have not given the interpreters 24 hours' notice  before  we
speak them.

Now today, when we are supposed to celebrate our mother tongue, this is  not
possible.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  I  am  sorry,  hon  member,   for
disturbing you. We have tried to listen to the  interpretation,  but  it  is
not there. [Interjections.]

Mr T M GONIWE:  Comrade  Chair,  can  it  then  be  assumed  that  the  time
allocated to the speaker will not be affected by these stoppages?

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Hon members, let us not be disturbed by what  is  happening.
The woman that I have just quoted, Iyanla  Vanzant,  says  that  life  is  a
school and we learn from  every  experience  that  we  go  through.  I  hope
today's experience will be a lesson for all of us. I hope we are  not  going
to come out of today's experience not having learnt anything with regard  to
respecting mother languages in this Parliament. [Applause.]

The decision which has been taken by Unesco, as I said earlier, is  relevant
to South Africa. South Africa is one country that is  different  from  other
countries. We recognise 11 official languages, including a  12th  one,  sign
language. The Constitution adopted a policy emanating  from  the  ANC's  RDP
document, which propagates multilingualism. The experiences that I  referred
to earlier on, ie neglect and not being welcomed,  can  have  a  devastating
impact.

This Government has decided to make amends for what we  experienced  in  the
past, and the Constitution has started that process. As a follow-up  to  the
Constitution, the Government,  through  the  Department  of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology, made big strides  in  implementing  multilingualism.
The first of such  strides  was  the  enactment  of  the  Pan-South  African
Language Board Act in 1995. The Pan-South  African  Language  Board  is  the
first of its kind. It was a  very  difficult  process.  There  is  no  other
country in the world which has an institution like PanSALB. South Africa  is
a starter, and we need to celebrate this achievement on our  part.  We  need
to give ourselves a pat on the back and celebrate ourselves. [Applause.]

One other thing that we need to indicate with  regard  to  South  Africa  is
that, although we know that an institution like the  EU  Parliament  has  11
official languages and the  UN  also  recognises  many  official  languages,
South Africa is the only country which, at  national  level,  recognises  11
official languages as a nation and as a country.  The  institutions  that  I
have referred to - the UN and the EU - are multinational institutions.  They
have broad resources together, that is why  implementation  there  has  been
easier compared to South Africa.

Hon members may think that  by  protesting  here  in  Parliament  I  do  not
appreciate what has been done. I do  appreciate  the  achievements  of  this
country. I do appreciate that we have made a leap which  no  nation  of  the
world has ever attempted. We know that there are countries like India  where
indigenous languages are recognised, but these are regional languages  which
are not used in their parliament as we do it here in South Africa.

This is not an easy task, but the issue is that we have to make a start.  We
know that it is going to be a long walk, but we have to  make  a  start.  We
have to begin. I was glad that last week the Deputy Speaker referred to  the
achievements  that  have  been  made  by  Government  with  regard  to   the
implementation of multilingualism in our country.

I want to applaud the efforts made by the Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the
Pan-South African Language Board, Prof Marivate, who  is  up  there  in  the
gallery. She has done a lot to start where there was no foundation  at  all.
She started everything from scratch, but we know  that  every  province  now
has a provincial language committee. The languages are being taken care  of,
but when one starts where there is no  foundation,  where  one  cannot  draw
from previous experiences,  it  is  not  easy.  So  we  need  to  claim  our
achievements, in spite of the difficulties that are still there.

The message that remains open to us is the one we got from  the  President's
state of the nation address, ie volunteerism. How far  are  we  prepared  as
South Africans to use that message in promoting our  mother  languages?  Are
we making efforts to accommodate people who cannot speak languages that  are
not familiar to ours? Are we making efforts to expose our children to  other
children who cannot speak their language? The Minister of Finance  yesterday
also sent  a  message  of  solidarity.  Are  we  in  solidarity  with  other
languages that are not ours?

I often listen to the Mail &  Guardian  advertisement  over  the  radio.  It
sounds very proud when it refers to hundreds of millions of  people  in  the
world who speak English - including me. It sounds very proud when it  refers
to the millions who speak English in South Africa, and that if  people  want
information they can go to the Mail & Guardian. Does  the  Mail  &  Guardian
ever think of the millions of South Africans who cannot read  English?  What
happens to their right to  information?  What  happens  to  their  right  to
education? Does the Mail  &  Guardian  ever  think  of  doing  something  in
solidarity, for instance to help the deaf by developing  sign  language,  so
that they can also have access to education? This  is  the  solidarity  that
our Minister was talking about yesterday. This is the volunteerism that  our
President was talking about when  he  delivered  his  state  of  the  nation
address.

It is a pity that I am now speaking off the cuff, but  I  hope  the  message
has landed. Let us make an effort to be in solidarity with those who  cannot
speak English. I hope our  Parliament  will  also  act  in  solidarity  with
people like me, who wanted to speak Setswana. [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: I rise on a point of  order,  Mr  Chairperson.  We  have  a
speaker's list before us which shows that many speakers in this debate  this
afternoon are going to be using languages other than English. If  there  are
no translation facilities, what we are doing is disempowering those  members
and it should be a matter for embarrassment and  shame,  that  when  we  are
discussing the promotion of mother tongues we are in fact disempowering  our
own members. Would it assist if we were to adjourn for a  little  while  and
let the translation service commence? [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I  have  been  told  that
the translators are there. There is  a  technical  problem  right  now.  The
sound cannot go down from up here to the system. They are attending  to  the
technical problem. If the House wants us to adjourn for  a  few  minutes,  I
would not have a problem with that. Then they can deal  with  the  technical
problem, and then we can come back. Before I do that,  can  the  Whips  just
discuss amongst themselves and guide the  Chair  as  to  whether  we  should
adjourn or whether we should proceed. Can the Whips just discuss that now?

I see the next speaker is going to speak in English. Can I  afford  him  the
opportunity to do so whilst the Whips are re-sorting the programme?

Mr R S NTULI:  Chairperson,  it  is  so  unfortunate  that  once  again  the
Ministers to whom this topic has more relevance are not here. Even the  only
Deputy Minister who is here is not going to afford us  the  benefit  of  his
wisdom, because he is not on the speaker's list. Be that  it  may,  I  shall
proceed.

The decision to observe  21  February,  which  is  today,  as  International
Mother Language Day was unanimously taken at the 30th General Conference  of
Unesco held on 17 November 1999, as has been indicated.  With  half  of  the
world's 6 000 languages facing the risk of dying out, Unesco is  again  with
us here, observing International Mother Language Day as part  of  the  drive
to protect the intangible, yet very significant, heritage  of  humanity  and
preserve cultural diversity.

We should not just look at this thing as a problem  outside  our  frontiers.
Even in this country, as we may be aware, two languages are already  on  the
threshold of becoming extinct, namely the San and Khoi  languages.  This  is
very unfortunate. We recognise the importance of the mother  tongue  in  the
development of commmunication skills, concept formation and creativity,  and
the fact  that  mother  languages  are  the  primary  vehicles  of  cultural
identity.

In the context of educational practice or,  more  specifically  language  in
education, mother tongue instruction assumes a very significant role.  There
is a false but pervasive belief that children should get into  English,  the
latter being more of a global and commercial language, as soon  as  possible
or they will be retarded in learning. More  and  more  primary  schools  are
introducing English, in many cases, as a second language  to  learners,  and
as the language of learning from ever earlier stages. This is  done  in  the
belief that it will improve the learner's fluency  in  English  and  promote
good overall academic achievement.

Unfortunately, this may be far from the truth, and  it  is,  indeed.  It  is
possible that by using a second language from too early on we  are  stunting
the development of our learners' mother tongue, impeding the development  of
their  cognitive  abilities  but,  more  tragically,   developing   negative
attitudes towards the first language, the mother language, as shown by  some
former  Model  C  black  children,  and  resulting  in  low  achievement  in
conceptual subjects such as mathematics, accounting and science.

While we in South  Africa  have  introduced  a  second  language  system  of
education for the majority of our learners, often  from  the  early  primary
levels, we should note that there is no  single  model  of  second  language
education. The three important  distinctions  between  different  models  of
second language education programmes concern the goals  of  the  programmes,
the transitional versus  the  maintenance  nature  of  the  programmes,  the
degree of the immersion, and the time at which immersion begins.

A transitional programme has the goal of  ultimately  assimilating  learners
both linguistically and socially into the dominant language and culture.  On
the other hand, the maintenance programme has the goal  of  reinforcing  the
home language and sense of cultural identity  of  the  learner  as  well  as
developing  proficiency  in  the  second  language,  thus   promoting   full
bilingualism. We believe that  a  maintenance  bilingual  education  system,
achieved through a delayed partial  immersion  model,  is  the  best  for  a
plural society such as ours, which encourages multilingualism as a  unifying
factor.
It is widely accepted by many researchers  of  bilingual  education  that  a
unitary cognitive academic proficiency underlies all  language  performance.
This cognitive academic proficiency is developed  primarily  through  mother
language in the early years and may then be transferred to and expressed  in
a second language  later  on.  This  implies  that  if  a  learner's  mother
language comprehension remains underdeveloped, then so  does  the  learner's
cognitive ability.  Thus,  when  the  learner  attempts  to  pursue  studies
through the medium of a second language, that learner  will  bring  a  lower
cognitive academic proficiency to the task and be disadvantaged.

The popular notion that the  earlier,  the  better  with  regard  to  second
language education may possibly be based  on  the  appearance  of  a  second
language proficiency created by face-to-face interaction and, yet,  this  is
erroneous because we are confusing communicative proficiency with  cognitive
proficiency.

In the light of the foregoing, what then are the options that face  us?  The
DA advocates  that  schools,  particularly  the  primary  schools,  need  to
identify the grades at  which  the  different  languages  will  operate.  We
believe that a delayed partial immersion model is  best  for  South  African
schools. This implies that the use of mother language  as  the  language  of
learning should continue, as a minimum, until the  learners  are  around  10
years of age, which is up to Grade 4. The use of  English  or  Afrikaans  as
the language of learning should start, at the earliest, at Grade  5  and  be
pursued further.

Finally, the DA advocates  that  schools  should  recognise  the  difference
between different types of subjects. Some fields of learning, in  particular
mathematics and science literacy, are conceptually abstract and may well  be
delayed as introduced through the medium of the second language.[Applause.]

USIHLALO WAMAKOMITI: Mhlonishwa Mnumzane  Douglas  Gibson  ngicela  ulalele.
Sebengitshelile-ke  labo   abalungisa   imishini   ukuthi   imishini   yethu
isilungile. Ngakho-ke lezo  zikhulumi  ezilandelayo  angeke  zikhinyabezeke.
Inkulumo  yazo  izozwakala   kahle   ngezinye   izilimi.   Sesiyaqhubeka-ke.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The hon Douglas Gibson is  listening.  Those
who fix machines have told me that our machines  are  okay  now.  Therefore,
the speakers to come will not be disturbed. Their  speeches  will  be  heard
well in other languages. Now we are proceeding. [Applause.]]

I now call on the hon R S Ntuli. [Interjections.] I am sorry, I  meant  S  B
Ntuli, not R S Ntuli. There are two Ntulis following on one another.

Mnu S B NTULI: Sihlalo, iNdlu ehloniphekile kanye  noSosiswebhu,  ngiyabonga
ukuthola leli thuba engilinikeziwe lokuthi  ngizokhuluma  ngosuku  lwezilimi
zabantu esilubiza ngokuthi i-Mother Language.

Silugubha  okokuqala  namuhla  lapha  eNingizimu  Afrika.  Okokuqala   lokhu
esikwenzayo namhlanje. Nathi kufanele ukuthi uma  sikhuluma  ezinhlanganweni
lezo esisuke sikuzo njengalapha eNdlini  ehloniphekile,  sikwazi  ukukhuluma
ngolimi lwethu. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S B NTULI: Madam Speaker, honourable House and the Whip, I  am  glad  to
have this opportunity to speak on this, the day of mother tongues, which  we
call Mother Language Day.

It is the first time that we are celebrating it here  in  South  Africa.  We
are doing this for the first time. We, too, should be able to speak our  own
languages when we speak in large  meetings,  like  when  we  speak  in  this
honourable house.]

Colonialism  brought  with  it  various   mechanisms   to   keep   conquered
communities suppressed. One of the tools used was language. Language is  one
aspect of power, for people cannot share power if they do  not  have  access
to their own mother languages. Historically, it was for this reason that  in
1955, under the ANC as a liberation movement, people  gathered  in  Kliptown
to draw up the Freedom Charter. They drew up among others  clause  8,  which
states that the doors of learning and culture shall be opened.  This  clause
was drawn up because the Congress of the People acknowledged the  fact  that
for the total emancipation of the people to take place, the culture  of  the
people had to be restored.

Namuhla sithola ukuthi amagama ayaguqulwa bese kuthi lapho eguqulwa,  abanye
bethu bakhale ngokuthi lokhu kungukudlala ngemali. Akufanele lokhu  sikubone
njengendlela  yokuchitha  imali  ngokungafanele,   ngoba   uma   sesikhuluma
ngokulungiswa kwezinto sikhuluma  ngokuthi  kubuyiselwe  isithunzi  sabantu.
Ukuze  isithunzi  sabo  sibuyele,  kufanele-ke  ukuthi  bazibize   ngamagama
anencazelo empilweni yabo, kungaveli nje kuthiwe unguJani  kanti  bekufanele
kuthiwe unguSomangamani. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[We find that names have been changed and when they were changed some of  us
complained that it was just the waste of money. We should not  see  this  as
an unnecessary way of  spending  money,  because  when  we  talk  about  the
rectification of things, we  talk  about  the  re-installation  of  people's
status. For their status to be re-installed they should call  themselves  by
the words that have meaning in their lives, for example, one must  not  just
call someone Jan, while his real name is Somangamani.]

Hence, today, as we pay tribute to the International  Mother  Language  Day,
we South Africans should celebrate this day by ensuring that  we  learn  and
develop our mother languages. We should also learn other peoples  languages;
we should learn, respect and  appreciate  other  peoples  languages  in  the
spirit of our motto ``Unity in Diversity''.

Our Constitution contains a Bill of Rights which is mainly premised  on  the
notion of individual rights. The language clauses should be understood  from
the orientation of language as a right. Therefore, the purpose of  the  Bill
of Rights is to ensure that the South African society becomes  one  that  is
based on the firm democratic principle  of  equality,  irrespective  of  the
development of these other languages.

Hence, the structures established in terms of the Constitution are meant  to
assist in the democratisation of  our  society.  PanSALB  is  one  of  these
structures and thus its  work  will  further  these  democratic  principles.
Among  others,  the  national  and  provincial  governments  may   use   any
particular official language for the purposes  of  governance,  taking  into
account  usage,  practicality,  expense,  regional  circumstances  and   the
balance of the needs and preferences of the population as a whole or in  the
province concerned. But for the  national  Government  and  each  provincial
government it is a matter of must that it should use at least  two  official
languages. Municipalities must take into  account  the  language  usage  and
preferences of their residents.

Kungakho-ke nePitoli ekade  yaziwa  ngokuthi  yi-Pretoria  manje  sesiyibiza
ngokuthi  i-Tswane,  ne-East  Rand  sesithi  i-Ekurhuleni  kanti  i-Northern
Province isizokwaziwa ngeLimpopo.

Lokhu akusho ukuthi uhulumeni  wasekhaya  awunasidingo  sokusebenzisa  imali
ukwenza ezinye izinto. Izidingo zabantu bakithi ziseziningi  kakhulu,  kodwa
inkinga esinayo ngukuthi uma singawaguquli la magama, awabi nancazelo  futhi
awenzi kuxhumana phakathi kwabantu abaningi abahlala endaweni kanye  nendawo
leyo abazibiza ngayo; yize sesithi sikhululekile.

Uma  sinikeza  la  magama  aseguquliwe  akufanele,   ngiyagcizelela   futhi,
akufanele  sithi  cha  lena  ngenye  yezindlela  zokuchitha  izimali,   yini
kungenziwanga lokhu nalokhu. Kufanele sibe nokubekezelelana  siqonde  ukuthi
kusukela  ku-1994  sakha  kabusha,  ngakho  sizokwakha  nangakho   ukunikeza
amagama amasha ezindaweni zethu. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[That is why Pretoria, which was known as Pretoria, is  now  called  Tswane.
The East Rand is now known as Ekurhuleni and the Northern  Province  is  now
called Limpopo.

This does not mean that local governments do not have other needs  on  which
they can spend their money. The needs of our people are too  many,  but  the
problem is that if we do not change these words, they do  not  have  meaning
and they do not create communication among many people who reside  in  those
places, even though we say we are free.

When we give new names we should not, and I emphasise, we  should  not,  say
this is a waste of money, or ask why this and that was not done. We need  to
tolerate  each  other  and  understand  that  since  1994   we   have   been
reconstructing, therefore we will now reconstruct by renaming our places.]

The Department of Education has  drawn  up  a  language-in-education  policy
implementation plan. Through the plan the  department  addresses  itself  to
some nodal points, which are as follows: Firstly,  the  national  foundation
phase literacy programme which is aimed  at  improving  all  learners'  home
language competence in the foundation phase. In this regard  the  plan  will
make a distinction between  schools  serving  monolingual  and  multilingual
learner populations.

Secondly there is a national general and further development plan  programme
which is aimed at improving learners'  second  language  competence  in  the
post-foundation phase. The focus of this programme  would  be  learning  and
teaching in  mathematics,  science  and  technology.  Thirdly,  there  is  a
national language development programme, which will also focus on the  post-
foundation phase, that is from Grade 4 up to Grade 12,  to  make  sure  that
the very fundamental subjects like maths, science and  technology  are  also
translated into the said mother languages. In order  to  realise  the  above
initiatives, parents need to support school governing bodies.

Okuyiyona  ndlela  yokuxhasa   ama-school   governing   body   ngukuzihlupha
kwabazali, kuthi uma kubizwa imihlangano baye khona. Uma  befika  kuyo  leyo
mihlangano,  kufanele  bakwazi  ukuthi  imibono  yabo  ingene   emithethweni
ephethe inqubo yesikole ukuze abazali balabo  bantwana  abasezikoleni  lapho
izilimi zabo zingabhekelelwe khona, bafike bazikhulumele.  Kufuneka-ke  bese
bebambisana ne-governing  body  bathathe  izinqumo  ngokuthi  inqubo  yalesi
sikole izosebenza kanjani. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[The way of supporting school governing bodies takes place by means  of  the
parent's dedication in attending meetings when they are  called  to  do  so.
When they come to those meetings, they  should  be  able  to  endorse  their
opinions to suit the rules contained in the  school  policies  so  that  the
parents of those children who are  at  schools  where  their  languages  are
neglected will be able to  express  themselves  regarding  those  languages.
They should co-operate with school governing bodies and  take  decisions  as
to how the policy of their school is going to work.]

In so doing parents will also be heeding the President's call for  a  spirit
of volunteerism.

Ngiqinisekile ukuthi asidingi ukuthi sikhokhelwe ukwenza lokho,  singasukuma
sizenzele ngokwethu. Okubalulekile ngukuthi kusukela kulesi sikhathi  uqalwa
lo nyaka, kufanele sizimisele. Uma  senza  lokho,  siyobe  siletha  inguquko
empilweni yethu. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[I am sure we do not have to be paid for that, we can stand  up  and  do  it
ourselves. The important thing is that we  should  dedicate  ourselves  from
the beginning of the year. If we do that, we would be bringing about  change
in our lives.]

The school governing bodies of the  former  Model  C  schools  need  to  be,
receptive to transformation with regard to the change  in  schools  language
policy, in order to accommodate the  black  or  African  learners  in  their
schools. People are now settling in the formerly whites  only  areas.  As  a
result their needs, which include  education,  should  be  accommodated  and
their mother languages should be recognised. Learners should not be  grouped
based on their mother languages, but rather on the subject content.

Akufanele kuthiwe laba ngoba  bakhuluma  isiBhunu  ngeke  bafunde  isiNgisi,
ngakho masithathe laba  sibase  kuleli  klasi  ngoba  bangamaNdebele  bonke,
khona bezofunda isiNdebele. Uma senza kanjalo kusho  ukuthi  asiwuthuthukisi
umphakathi ngoba lona uzokhula engakwazi ukusebenzisana nalaba abanye.

Into esiyikhalelayo ngukuthi ukuqenjulwa kwamaklasi kungayi  ngolimi,  kepha
kuye ngezifundo ezifana ne-Maths, isayensi  nezinye.  (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[We should not say that because these people speak Afrikaans they  will  not
learn English. We argue that therefore we should  take  these  children  and
put them in that class just because they are all Ndebele, so that they  will
learn Ndebele. If we do  that,  it  means  we  are  not  improving  society,
because that child will not learn how to work together with other people.

What we are  complaining  about  is  that  classes  should  not  be  divided
according to language, but according to subjects such as maths, science  and
others.]

I am saying that in so doing, we as parents would be living up to our  motto
- which I referred to earlier, ie unity in  diversity  -  with  the  aim  of
building the envisaged rainbow nation.

Ngithanda ukugcina ngokuthi ngithi  ukubalula  lokhu.  Esikhathini  esiningi
thina  bantu   sivame   ukuthi   uma   sikhuluma   izilimi   uthole   ukuthi
asivumelananga ngenqubo yokuthi sizosebenzisa luphi  ulimi,  ngakho  ngicela
ukuthi sikwenze lokho. Nalapha ekhaya  namuhla  sizamile  ukuthi  sishintshe
izinkulumo  zethu.  Ngiqinisekile  ukuthi  amalungu  ahloniphekile   ayabona
ukuthi lokhu kuyakhinyabeza kakhulu, ngoba umuntu uqale abhale lokhu,  abuye
akucishe aphinde abhale okunye. Leyo ngenye  yezinto  ezingasiphathi  kahle.
Kodwa, kukho konke lokho, ngicela ukusho  ukuthi  ngiyathokoza,  ngiyabonga,
dankie, ke a leboga [thanks].  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  Zulu  paragraph
follows.)

[I would like to  conclude  by  mentioning  that  sometimes  when  we  speak
languages one finds that we have not  agreed  on  the  policy  of  how  that
language will be used, therefore, I would like us to do that. Even  here  at
home we tried to change our speeches. I am sure that hon  members  see  that
this is very disturbing, because one has to write  it  first  and  then  one
writes it over and one keeps doing just that, writing  and  rewriting.  That
is one of the things that we are not happy about. In spite of  all  that,  I
would like to say that I am happy, I am saying  thank  you,,  dankie,  ke  a
leboga. [Applause.]]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson and colleagues, we  know  with  certainty  -  and
regard it as self-evident - the necessity to  promote  mother  language  for
both development and  empowerment.  Moreover,  the  Constitution  entrenches
that. We know and believe this, and we  are  all  agreed  on  it.  And  yet,
ironically, here in Parliament today, we are still debating this issue.

In essence, there is a  problem.  Where  does  that  problem  lie?  It  lies
uniquely with  English,  moving  like  a  bulldozer  amongst  our  group  of
language huts, knocking them down to the left and  right,  back  and  front.
This is because English has become the language of  science,  commerce,  the
major cinema industry and of IT. It is, in a sense, unassailable.

In Germany they recently started taking BBC broadcasts directly in  English.
The BBC broadcasts with translations into German, but these  are  now  being
regarded as superfluous.

Now, to bang one's head against the widening use of English  is  to  inflict
self-injury. It would be more useful to examine how one's own mother  tongue
can be  supported,  in  spite  of  this  tremendous  onslaught  of  English.
Therefore, we need to turn our attention not to the enemy  outside,  but  to
the enemy within. This is the insidious and destructive enemy  that  damages
the mother tongue. That enemy is the lack of vocabulary.

To give hon members an idea, the English stock of  words,  with  which,  for
example, the Oxford Dictionary works, at the moment exceeds half a  million.
This stock continues to grow at an accelerated pace year in and year out.  A
person who has a good command of the English  language  should  be  familiar
with at least 20% of the word stock. This equates to about 100 000 words.

Now let us draw two circles, a big one and a small  one  within.  The  small
circle represents the area within which the mother tongue  is  employed.  In
that small circle, to be able to talk to one's mother, parents  or  friends,
one needs perhaps no more than 1 000 or  2 000  words.  But  in  the  bigger
circle, in which science and commerce prevail, we need to  be  able  to  set
our targets at 100 000 words.

Therefore,  in  societies  which  are  lagging  behind   educationally   and
economically, the vocabulary is very restricted. My guess - and this  is  no
more than a guess - is that in such communities the vocabulary  ranges  from
2 000 to 3 000 words and seldom exceeds 5 000 words.

Now if mother tongue is going to be confined to just limited social use  and
maybe very limited educational use, no matter how much  we  speak  about  it
here, no matter how much we bang our heads against the wall,  mother  tongue
is not going to grow, because it is going to have limited use in that  wider
circle.

The problem of vocabulary acquisition is an acute problem, and one that  all
of us, as members of Parliament, need to face up to. This is  a  problem  of
our schooling generally: in our schools we  attempt  to  teach  grammar  and
comprehension, but we do not teach the most fundamental  of  things,  namely
vocabulary.

Likewise, the promotion of literature, drama,  cinema,  etc,  must  also  be
given support, in order that that circle in which mother tongue is used  can
be broadened.  Further  developments  in  mother  tongue  will  be  directly
dependent on the following five factors.

Firstly, whether  young  people  in  society  are  socially  and  culturally
attracted to the mother tongue. Secondly, whether terms and  vocabulary  are
available for complex technological and scientific projects -  and  this  is
where the dictionary projects come into question.

Thirdly, whether suitable literature is available in volumes and at  a  good
price to readers who would want to  use  their  mother  language.  Fourthly,
whether the media, particularly the visual media, can develop support and  a
following. Fifthly, whether schools will have  the  expertise  to  focus  on
vocabulary as an important ingredient in education.

If we look at money, we find that the total amount of rands that we have  in
our back pockets or in our bank balance gives us freedom. The more rands  we
have, the freer we are to make choices and to spend our  money  the  way  we
want to. It is exactly the same situation with language: those who have  the
vastest vocabulary have the greatest freedom to read whatever they  want  to
read, study whatever they want to study and are able to articulate the  most
complex ideas clearly and lucidly, because they can call on that  vocabulary
at any moment, anywhere and at any time.

Consider the following: if my children, your children and  the  children  of
this nation were to come back from school today and  we  were  to  ask  them
about the extent of vocabulary expansion undertaken or if we  were  to  look
through their books, would we find that minimal  effort  was  made  in  that
regard? It does not matter whether this is Afrikaans, isiZulu or any of  the
other languages.
I want to state here quite clearly that as long as we do not concentrate  on
vocabulary expansion, there  will  be  no  development  of  mother  language
competence in our country. We may strive to spend a  lot  of  money  on  the
whole educational endeavour, but if the foundation is not built -  and  that
foundation is one of vocabulary - comprehension becomes impossible,  writing
becomes limited, expressing oneself becomes severely constrained.

So if we really want to be  able  to  promote  mother  tongue  and  language
generally, it is imperative and behoves us to  ensure  that  vocabulary  and
vocabulary expansion is given the utmost attention.

It is a very complex area and a moving target. Because of the fact  that  it
is a moving target,  we  are  not  inclined  to  give  attention  to  it  in
education. But that  is  a  weakness.  Until  and  unless  we  correct  this
weakness, our educational endeavour will miscarry and these great dreams  we
have of mother tongue education and its greater use, will remain a  hopeless
dream, something that we will be talking about for 5, 10 or  15  years.  The
problem is that the enemy is vocabulary. This is what we need to attack  and
conquer.

Mev A VAN WYK: Agb Voorsitter, moedertaal as  medium  van  onderrig  is  die
sleutel tot die ontwikkeling van Suid-Afrika en  die  ontwikkeling  van  die
ganse Afrika. Die bepalinge van die Vereenigde Nasies se Declaration of  the
Rights of Persons Belonging to National, Ethnic,  Religious  and  Linguistic
Minorities, waarna die agb Mev  Tsheole  verwys  het,  is  eintelik  gesonde
verstand, want dit beteken in wese  dat  mense  aanvaarding  geniet  en  hul
menseregte gerespekteer word. Op dié wyse verwyder 'n  regering  die  gevoel
van bedreiging,  verwerping  en  minagting  wat  minderhede  en  nasies  kan
ervaar.

Die  vervulling  van  hierdie  basiese  menslike   behoefte   verwyder   die
konflikpotensiaal  wat  daar  in  diverse  samelewings  kan   voorkom.   Die
miskenning en ondermyning van die status of  ontwikkeling  van  tale  in  'n
veelvolkige land is ook dikwels bloot op  vrees  gegrond.  Die  taak  is  te
ingewikkeld, redeneer die Regering; dit gaan  te  duur  wees,  redeneer  die
regering. Dit gaan te moeilik  wees  om  alle  groepe  wat  so  bemagtig  is
bymekaar te hou. Maar in Suid-Afrika - en ek wil eerlik wees,  ons  leef  in
'n tyd van openheid - is daar ook 'n ander dinamiek wat geld,  en  dit  gaan
om  die  moedertaal  van  een  van  die  groepe  in  ons   samelewing,   die
Afrikaanssprekende.
Die   President   en   die   regerende   party   gaan   uit   hul   pad   om
Afrikaanssprekendes gerus te stel, om hulle te  betrek,  om  hulle  te  laat
voel hulle word aanvaar as Afrikaners, om hulle aan te moedig om hul  kragte
en talente aan te wend ter ontwikkeling van ons vaderland.

Die Nuwe NP is die erfgenaam van die partye wat hul  oorsprong  het  in  die
bevrydingstryd van die Afrikaner, in die stryd  om  die  erkenning  van  hul
moedertaal en die  reg  op  moedertaalonderrig.  Die  Nuwe  NP  is  ook  die
erfgenaam van die party wat apartheid in die Wetboek vasgelê het.

Die ANC het die visie om met hierdie party 'n  ooreenkoms  aan  te  gaan  om
saam te regeer. Die ANC is bevry en die  Nuwe  NP  is  bevry,  want  hierdie
diepgaande simboliese optrede staan in die teken  van  versoening.  Hiervoor
kan ons almal hard werk. Hierdie versoeningsboodskap het egter nog nie  oral
uitgekom  nie,  en  kan  ook  nie  solank  daar  optrede   teen   Afrikaanse
geestesgoedere en instellings is nie, veral teen opvoedkundige inrigtings.

Maar wat veral bevry moet word, is die swart moedertale. Ons  wil  hê  mense
moet byvoorbeeld die relatiwiteitsteorie in Die  Groot  Gedagte  van  Gideon
Joubert, wat vroeër daar op die balkon gesit het, in Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho,  en
al die Afrika-tale, kan lees. Afrikaans staan in die pad daarvan. Hoekom  sê
ek so? Die oorblywende reste van uitgediende  vooroordele,  van  uitgediende
mistastinge  wil  Afrikaans  nie  sy  volwaardige  plek  toelaat  nie,   wil
Afrikaans nie sy bevrydingsrol van die ander inheemse tale laat  speel  nie.
Dis mos waar!

Die  ANC  hoef  nie  uit  grootmoedigheid  die  bepalinge  en  optredes  wat
Afrikaans en Afrikaanse instellinge aftakel uit die weg te ruim  nie.  Hulle
hoef ook nie Afrikaans bo ander tale  te  stel  nie,  maar  hulle  moet  wel
aanvaar dat Afrikaans 'n sleutelrol kan speel in die  ontwikkeling  van  die
ander  inheemse  tale.  Die  Woordeboek  van  die  Afrikaanse   Taal   speel
byvoorbeeld so 'n rol.

Die geweldige werk wat Afrikaanse vakkundiges ingesit het in die  verlede  -
ons het reeds  'n  baie  goeie  fondament  -  in  die  vorige  terminologie-
departemente, die Akademie vir Wetenskap  en  Kuns,  die  universiteite,  en
tans, onder  meer  in  die  Departement  vir  Kuns,  Kultuur,  Wetenskap  en
Tegnologie,  is  daar  vir  almal  om  te  sien  -  rakke   en   rakke   vol
vakwoordeboeke.

Ek herhaal, ons het 'n uitstekende fondament vir  die  taalontwikkeling  van
swart tale. Taalontwikkeling en vaktaallyste, spesifiek in die  swart  tale,
die  afgelope  ongeveer  30-40  jaar  is  grotendeels  die   prestasie   van
Afrikaanse terminoloë. Ter erkenning  van  hul  werk  vra  ek  die  Regering
vandag, en ek is baie jammer nie een van  die  betrokke  Ministers  is  hier
nie, om ook weer aan Afrikaans sy regmatige plek  te  gee  in  hierdie  nuwe
fase van bevryding wat Suid-Afrika nou betree, want  dan  kan  die  Regering
ook werklik skiet gee oor die moedertaalonderrig in ander tale.

Ek wil 'n boodskap stuur aan Mnr Asmal, en hom vra om die geld  te  vind  om
ten minste een groot terminologiesentrum by 'n  universiteit  te  vestig  om
stukrag te gee aan die ontwikkeling van Suid-Afrika se inheemse  tale.  Daar
is reeds universiteite wat sulke departemente het, en wat  bereid  sou  wees
om só 'n sentrum te vestig.

Die Nuwe NP wil moedertaalonderrig in  al  ons  inheemse  tale  tot  op  die
hoogste opvoedkundige vlak laat uitbrei. Die uitdagings van die opbloei  van
Afrika verg dit van ons.  Vaktaalontwikkeling  en  moedertaalskoolhandboeke,
tesame  met  beter  onderwys  en  opleiding  is  van  kritieke  belang   vir
opheffing. Dit is waarin die Minister van Onderwys  sy  formidabele  energie
moet stort.

Die ANC se National Education Policy  Inquiry-verslag  van  1993  onderskryf
hierdie argument. Dus, om al hierdie  en  ander  tegniese  en  opvoedkundige
redes ook, kan ons nie langer  voortgaan  om  Engels  ten  koste  van  ander
moedertale te bevorder nie. Bowendien, wat gaan  ons  doen  wanneer  Chinees
die  dominante   sake-   en   tegnologiewêreldtaal   word?   Moedertale   is
onvervangbaar. Daarsonder sal ons nie 'n renaissance beleef nie.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs A VAN WYK: Hon Chairperson, mother language as a  medium  of  education
is the key to the development of South Africa  and  to  the  development  of
Africa in its entirety. The provisions of the  United  Nations'  Declaration
of the Rights of  Persons  Belonging  to  National,  Ethnic,  Religious  and
Linguistic Minorities, to which the hon Mrs Tsheole referred,  are  actually
common sense, because it basically means that people  enjoy  acceptance  and
their human rights are respected. In  this  way  a  government  removes  the
feelings of danger, rejection and disrespect which  minorities  and  peoples
can experience.
The fulfilment of this basic  human  need  removes  the  conflict  potential
which can occur in diverse societies. The disregarding  and  undermining  of
the status or development of languages in a  multilingual  country  is  also
often based merely on fear. The task  is  too  complicated,  the  government
reasons; it is going to be too expensive,  the  government  reasons.  It  is
going to be  too  difficult  to  keep  all  groups  empowered  in  this  way
together. But in South Africa - and I want to be honest, we live in  a  time
of openness - there is also another dynamic which applies, and that  relates
to the mother language of one of the groups in our  society,  the  Afrikaans
speakers.

The President and the  governing  party  are  going  out  of  their  way  to
reassure Afrikaans speakers, to involve them, to make them  feel  that  they
are accepted as Afrikaners, to encourage them  to  utilise  their  abilities
and talents for the development of our fatherland.

The New NP is the heir  of  the  parties  which  had  their  origin  in  the
liberation struggle of the Afrikaner, in the struggle  for  the  recognition
of their mother language and the right to mother language  instruction.  The
New NP is also the heir of the party which wrote apartheid into the  Statute
Book.

The ANC has the vision to enter into an agreement with this party to  govern
together. The ANC is liberated and the New NP  is  liberated,  because  this
profound symbolic behaviour is the epitome of  reconciliation.  We  can  all
work hard for this. However, this message of reconciliation has not  reached
all areas, nor can it as long as there is action  against  Afrikaans  mental
assets and institutions, particularly against educational institutions.

But what must be liberated in particular are  the  black  mother  languages.
For example, we want people to be able to read the theory of  relativity  in
Die Groot Gedagte  by  Gideon  Joubert,  who  was  sitting  in  the  balcony
earlier, in Zulu, Xhosa and Sotho, and all the African languages.  Afrikaans
is standing in the way of this. Why do I say this? The remains  of  obsolete
prejudices, of  obsolete  blunders  do  not  want  to  allow  Afrikaans  its
rightful place, do not want Afrikaans to play its liberation  role  for  the
other indigenous languages. Surely this is true!

The ANC does not have to remove the stipulations and behaviour  which  break
down Afrikaans and Afrikaans institutions out of generosity.  They  also  do
not have to elevate Afrikaans above other languages, but  they  do  have  to
accept that Afrikaans can play a key role in the development  of  the  other
indigenous languages. The Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal,  for  example,
plays such a role.

The tremendous work which Afrikaans specialists put in  in  the  past  -  we
already have a very good foundation in the  former  terminology  department,
the Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns, the universities - and currently,  inter
alia, in the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology,  is  there
for all to see - shelves and shelves full of technical dictionaries.

I repeat, we have an excellent foundation for the  language  development  of
black languages. Language development and terminolgy lists, specifically  in
the black languages, over the past approximately 30 to 40 years are  largely
the achievement of Afrikaans terminologists. In recognition of their work  I
ask the Government today, and I am very sorry that not one of  the  relevant
Ministers is here, also once again to give Afrikaans its rightful  place  in
this new phase of liberation which South Africa  is  now  entering,  because
then the Government  can  also  truly  have  plenty  of  leeway  for  mother
language education in other languages.

I want to send a message to Mr Asmal, and ask  him  to  find  the  money  at
least to establish one large terminology centre  at  a  university  to  give
impetus to the development of South  Africa's  indigenous  languages.  There
are already universities which have such departments,  and  which  would  be
prepared to establish such a centre.

The New NP would like  mother  language  education  in  all  our  indigenous
languages to be extended to the highest educational  level.  The  challenges
of the revival of Africa require this of  us.  Terminology  development  and
mother language textbooks, together with improved  education  and  training,
are of critical importance for upliftment. This is  where  the  Minister  of
Education should expend his formidable energy.

The ANC's National Education Policy Inquiry report  of  1993  supports  this
argument. Therefore, for all  these  and  other  technical  and  educational
reasons too, we can no longer continue to promote English at the expense  of
other mother languages. Besides, what  are  we  going  to  do  when  Chinese
becomes  the  dominant  global  business  and  technology  language?  Mother
languages  are  irreplaceable.  Without  them  we  will  not  experience   a
renaissance. [Applause.]]

[Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Mr Chairperson,  hon  members  of  Parliament,  the  main
issue today is the celebration of the beauty and  diversity  of  our  mother
languages. I am not going to speak in a foreign language, but I am going  to
speak my mother  tongue,  because  saying  that  I  am  speaking  a  foreign
language would be wrong. We Basotho believe that each and every  thing  that
one does, one does not for his or her benefit alone, but for the benefit  of
his or her family or his or her community. That is  why  I  am  speaking  my
mother tongue, not in a foreign language.

We have ample reasons for celebrating these languages. Our understanding  is
that we are doing this as part of  the  celebration  and  enjoyment  of  our
liberation. We are enjoying the fact that we are South African citizens.  It
is our understanding, also, that all these things are possible,  because  of
our human rights.

Members of the ANC who  were  in  Durban  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,
attending the celebration of  the  ANC's  90th  birthday,  had  heard  this.
Besides those who were in Durban, all of us who were  in  this  House  on  8
February also heard it. We all know, as the Basotho  say,  that  the  little
ping cannot go ``ping'' before it hears the sound of the  great  ping.  When
the little ping does not go ``ping'', sometimes it is  because  it  has  not
heard the sound of the great ping. However, we  all  heard  the  great  ping
that sits over there. [Applause.]

This year, I would like us to take a closer look  at  the  things  that  are
going on in our country. The ANC, in its policy,  says  that  the  doors  of
learning and knowledge shall be fully opened. We heard, at the beginning  of
the year, on 8 February, when the great ping repeated for  the  third  time,
that all the doors of learning and knowledge must be opened for the sake  of
development.

Today, we may ask ourselves why we are celebrating these languages  in  this
manner. Firstly, when one understands  another  person's  language,  one  is
also able to  understand  how  that  person  lives.  One  is  also  able  to
understand where that person comes from, how poor or rich that person is.

When we look closely at all the languages of  South  Africa,  we  note  that
there are certain expressions that we simply  cannot  translate  fully  into
other languages. There are some amusing expressions that, when one tries  to
translate for a person who comes from  another  country,  are  difficult  to
understand.  For  example,  when  the  hon  Member  Ms  Ntuli  spoke   about
``mfaz'omnyama'' here the other day, we  could  not  understand  everything,
because  ``a  witch  always  remains  a  witch''  whereas  a  witch  and   a
traditional healer are not one and the same.

When I look at the Afrikaans language I am reminded of an  incident  that  I
will never forget that has to do with the brewing of  coffee.  They  explain
the different methods of brewing coffee in a peculiar way. We  all  know  in
English something that is called ``filtered coffee''. In  Afrikaans,  it  is
called ``moerkoffie''. If one tried to translate that by saying that  he  or
she is asking for ``moerkoffie, en hulle gooi die  koffie  in  en  moer  die
water by die koffie'', [filtered coffee, and they put in the coffee and  add
the  water]  the  English  translation  will  misses  the  pun.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.] However, all that is part of the beauty  of  this  country,  the
skills and expertise that are found in this country.

These days we complain about our children, saying that  they  are  prone  to
violence and disorder. We must admit, however, that  all  those  things  are
caused by the fact that, in the first place, they do not know  their  mother
tongues and, secondly, they do not know where they come  from  and  they  do
not know where they are going, because they have lost their culture.

When I was still a little girl, that is, before I went to school - I do  not
know how I can translate this concept of a little girl  that  I  am  talking
about  into  English  -   my   grandmother,   who   was   referred   to   as
``ngwanamoramaga'', used to teach me how to speak so that  my  tongue  could
get used to the language in preparation for school later  on.  She  used  to
make me practice the following limerick: Dipudi-ka-mabane-ga-se-ra-ke-re-di-
ldisa. I had to repeat this limerick very fast so that my tongue  could  get
used to the language so that when I eventually went to school,  the  teacher
would be able to communicate  with  me.  As  for  my  father,  he  made  the
exercise even more difficult for me. He used to make me  repeat  after  him,
saying:     Kgaka-sile-kgakala-gare-gare-pele-ga-dikgomo-kganthe-monna-tena-
morwa-morakala-o-a-reresa-ge-o-re-kgaka-sile-kgakala-gare-gare-pele-ga-
dikgomo.  [Applause.]  If  I  tried  to  translate  all  that  we  will  not
understand one another.

I was taught all this by my grandmother, who had  had  no  formal  education
whatsoever. It was only  when  I  was  in  Form  II  that  I  learned  about
phonetics. Can anyone tell me how my grandmother, who could not  even  write
her own name, knew these things? This is knowledge that is inherent  in  our
culture; it is an inborn skill. [Applause.]

Today, as we debate here, we may find out how our  languages  complement  or
reject one another. First of  all,  when  I  say  that  my  grandmother  was
referred to as ``ngwanamoramaga'', a person  who  is  proficient  in  Sepedi
will  know  that  she  was  an  only  girl.  That  is  why  she  was  called
``ngwanamoramaga''. It is because all the other children were boys. This  is
an indication of the richness of our language.

Today  our  Constitution  gives  us  the  right  to  use  all  our  official
languages. Time is against us. If we  were  to  agree,  after  consultation,
that each person must learn somebody else's language, we  will  progress  as
South Africans. Currently, we do not know one another, yet  all  of  us  are
children of this country.

When I looked at the Constitutive Act of the African Union I noted  that  it
also  allows  us  to  address  each  other  in  our  mother  languages  when
discussing what we must do  on  this  continent  to  bring  about  progress,
because for  a  long  time  we  were  segregated  according  to  our  mother
languages, some speaking French, others  Portuguese,  English,  etc.  Today,
however, we can come together and build our continent because we have a  lot
in common.

I would furthermore like to point out that last year  we  discussed  in  our
committee the feasibility of establishing a committee or board  for  African
languages. Such a committee will be of great  benefit  to  us.  Hon  members
have already heard from the explanation of the hon Member Mr Ntuli and  that
of the Deputy Chairperson of Committees, Mr Cassim, how this committee  will
work, that the intention is to compile dictionaries in our mother  languages
so that we may teach our children Science  and  Mathematics  in  our  mother
languages. Our languages were suppressed deliberately. Now is the  time  for
us to empower them, and to progress as a nation. [Applause.]

When we were debating the appointment of this committee, we were  left  with
a number of questions. I still have a number of questions that I would  like
to raise in this House. Why is it that at  our  universities  our  languages
are taught by people who do not speak those  languages?  Secondly,  when  it
comes  to  research,  a  person  researches  Sepedi  in  English.  I  cannot
understand why research is conducted in English when  the  researcher  wants
to understand Sepedi. These are some of the things that we,  as  Members  of
this House, must rectify and we must see  to  it  that  they  are  developed
properly. We have our work cut out, but I am confident that we will  succeed
because we are the South Africans who want to build this  country  of  ours.
If we co-operate, we will succeed. The little ping has  gone  ``ping''.  Let
us come together. [Applause.]]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Thank you, hon member.  I  hope
the hon member  will  be  making  that  special  brand  of  coffee  for  the
portfolio committee!

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil aansluit by mej Matubatse deur  te
sê dat hoewel ek baie hou van moerkoffie, ek  'n  afkeur  het  aan  gemoerde
koffie. [Mr Chairperson, I want  to  join  Miss  Matubatse  by  saying  that
although I really like ground coffee, I dislike the coffee dregs.]

I would also like to suggest that something be done about giving  access  to
the interpretation service to the journalists upstairs as well. They  suffer
a tremendous disadvantage in that the diversity of  this  debate  itself  is
lost to them altogether. Let us have some progress in that respect.

Humankind first emerged  in  Africa.  In  the  research  on  the  origin  of
humankind, all modern findings point in this  direction.  While  locally  we
are proud to focus on Cape Town as  the  Mother  City,  the  fact  that  our
continent is actually  Mother  Africa  is  often  ignored.  Mother  Africa's
offspring, as they left for other parts of the globe,  took  with  them  the
knowledge of the cultures, the customs and the  practices  that  were  drawn
from Mother Africa.

Prof Herbert Vilakazi, in his paper entitled The  Problem  of  Education  in
South Africa, argues that the crisis of Africa has its roots in the  African
slave trade, and the mass enslavement of Africans in the  Americas  and  the
Caribbean. It  was  deepened  and  systematised  by  European  colonisation,
colonialism and the domination of Africa.

The esteemed professor contends further that the tragic  experience  of  the
return of the very descendants  of  Mother  Africa,  who,  having  forgotten
their original relationship with her, enslaved their long-forgotten  cousins
and carried them in chains to distant lands, is  etched  in  the  psyche  of
humankind.

The observance of an International Mother Language Day is important  to  the
rise of Mother Africa, and therefore the rise of humankind. The  recognition
by Unesco's member  states  of  linguistic  and  cultural  diversity  is  an
acceptance  of  the   possibility   of   inspiring   solidarity   based   on
understanding, tolerance and dialogue. In the words  of  Unesco's  Director-
General, Koichiro Matsuura:
  Languages are not only an essential part of mankind's cultural  heritage,
  but the irreducible expression of  human  creativity  and  of  its  great
  diversity.

An estimated 6 000 languages are spoken worldwide, around a tenth  of  these
in Africa. While academics may argue a case for a  systematic  reduction  of
this number, the fact is that language is learnt  in  infancy  and  a  child
communicates best in its mother tongue.

Ek self het twee en 'n half tale geleer op my moeder  se  skoot:  Engels  en
Afrikaans, en dan basiese gebare. Dit is 'n groot nadeel vir my dat  ek  nie
meer tale geleer  het  nie.  Dit  is  die  houding  wat  ons  moet  aanleer.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I learned two and a half languages myself at my mother's knee: English  and
Afrikaans, and then basic gestures. It is very  much  to  my  own  detriment
that I did not learn any more languages. That is the attitude that  we  have
to adopt.]

Modern research points out that learners are  actually  suffering  permanent
disadvantage if the mother tongue is withheld in their education,  and  that
in so doing misconceptions and miscommunications arise.

The greatest problem arising from this fact is that languages themselves  do
not reach the same level of  growth  and  maturity  at  the  same  time.  In
African countries, more  so  in  South  Africa,  the  level  of  growth  and
development of multilingualism was predetermined and preprogrammed  to  keep
people apart and to keep them enslaved, rather than to  open  the  doors  to
their cultures.

The quest today is to promote communication,  understanding  and  solidarity
by encouraging the growth of all languages  and  to  foster  multilingualism
without losing track of developments in communication in  the  international
environment. [Time expired.]

Ms C DUDLEY:  Mr  Chairperson,  according  to  reports  many  South  African
children are being disadvantaged by being made to learn  English  too  soon.
International  research  levels  said  that  mother  tongue  proficiency  is
essential to mastering a second language and to academic success  generally.
At issue, however, seems to be not so much those who  are  starting  school,
but those already going through the system.

The ABC plan launched by an NGO to have language textbooks  translated  into
African languages to enable students to get a better  understanding  of  the
subject  before  doing  it  in  English  is  to  be  commended.   The   ACDP
congratulates those involved in this project.

The ACDP identifies with concern that children are being  made  to  learn  a
language which is foreign to them before they  have  grasped  at  least  the
basics of reading and writing in  their  mother  tongue,  just  as  a  child
should not be exposed to sex education, which cuts  across  values  held  by
the family, or  forced  to  learn  interfaith  religion  from  Grade  R,  as
Minister  Kader  Asmal  has  pledged.  Learning  about  other   faiths   and
responsible sex education can be useful just as other languages can be,  but
at the appropriate stage.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member,  I  think  you  are
exceeding  the  scope  of  the  topic.  You  should  return  to  the  topic.
[Interjections.]

Ms C  DUDLEY:  It  was,  in  fact,  Christian  missionaries  who  originally
codified the African languages, making it possible for them to be  read  and
be written. [Interjections.] But government interference in schools for  the
purpose of social engineering is not acceptable.

Minister Kader Asmal, by his own admission,  is  obsessed  with  controlling
all aspects of education through  one  mandatory  curriculum  which  imposes
radical sex  education,  compulsory  interfaith  religion,  takes  away  the
rights of parents  and  dictates  content.  This  is  a  travesty  and  will
culminate in a disaster.

Parents must have the final say, through school governing  bodies,  etc,  on
critical issues - including language - which affect their children  as  they
are answerable to God for the choices they  make.  The  state  must  not  be
allowed to usurp this very important and fundamental  responsibility.  [Time
expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I  think  you  put
the Chair in a difficult position when you take the main topic and treat  it
incidentally, and then take the incidental issues and  make  them  the  main
aspect of the debate. I  think  you  need  to  be  able  to  deal  with  the
substantive issue as the main issue.

Ms C DUDLEY: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Is language and  education
separable? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, if  you  look  at  the
thrust of the debate, you will find that it deals with the need  to  promote
mother tongue languages and, I think, that is what this  House  is  treating
at the moment: how to promote mother tongue usage.

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, met die skryf  van  die  Suid-Afrikaaanse
Grondwet het hierdie Regering veeltaligheid gekies. Hulle het  dit  nie  net
gekies nie, maar ook opdrag, volgens artikel 62 van die  Grondwet,  om  juis
veeltaligheid te bevorder. Tog gebeur dit nie.

Die eerste teken dat 'n taalgroep onderdruk word, is  wanneer  hy  nie  deur
onderwys sy taal van geslag tot geslag kan oordra nie.  Minister  Asmal  het
'n studiegroep saamgestel om die waardes van  die  onderwys  te  bepaal.  In
hulle werkstuk word ses waardes uitgewys,  waarvan  die  derde  een  is  dat
veeltaligheid 'n wesentlike norm van die onderwys is. Ons sê geluk  daarmee.
Die probleem is egter dat in die praktyk meer  as  80%  van  Suid-Afrikaanse
kinders tans nie moedertaalonderwys in Suid-Afrika ontvang nie.

Mev M P COETZEE-KASPER: Mnr die Voorsitter, op 'n  punt  van  orde:  is  dit
parlementêr dat die agb mnr Koos van der Merwe in die Huis eet, en  dat  ons
almal moet hongerly? [Gelag.] [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson,  with  the  writing  of  the  South  African
Constitution this Government chose  multilingualism.  They  not  only  chose
this, but have also been instructed, in accordance with section  62  of  the
Constitution, to promote multilingualism. However, this is not happening.

The first sign that a language group is being oppressed, is when  it  cannot
pass on its  language  from  generation  to  generation  through  education.
Minister Asmal has called together a study group to determine the values  of
education. In their report six values are highlighted, of  which  the  third
one  is  that  multilingualism  is  a  fundamental  norm  of  education.  We
congratulate them on that. The problem, however, is that  in  practice  more
than 80% of South  African  children  presently  are  not  receiving  mother
tongue education in South Africa.

Mrs M P  COETZEE-KASPER:  Mr  Chairperson,  on  a  point  of  order:  Is  it
parliamentary for the hon Mr Koos van der Merwe to be eating in  the  House,
and that we should all go hungry? [Laughter.] [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Let  us  carry  on  with  the
debate.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Mr Chairperson, may I just, in  terms  of  the  Rules,
reply and say to the hon member that it is peanuts and certain  animals  eat
them. The member can have one.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEE: Order! Thank you,  hon  member.  Please
preserve the decorum of the House so that the hon member can  continue  with
his speech.

Dr C P MULDER: Dit is jammer dat  ANC-lede  tydens  die  bespreking  van  'n
onderwerp soos hierdie sit en grappe maak oor ``peanuts''. Dit laat 'n  mens
wonder waarmee hulle besig is. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Binnekort  moet  die   Minister   egter   belangrike   besluite   neem   oor
moedertaalonderwys op universiteitsvlak. Die VF  het  aanvaar  dat  Minister
Asmal die beginsel van moedertaalonderwys verstaan, tog vra hy  hoekom  daar
in die vorige bedeling  twee  universiteite,  naamlik  Wits  en  die  Randse
Afrikaanse Universiteit, slegs vier kilometer van mekaar  was.  Hy  vra  die
vraag of dit deel was van die verwronge denke van apartheid.

In België sal Minister Asmal vind dat in Brussel 'n Vlaamse universiteit  en
'n Franse universiteit slegs 'n paar kilometer van mekaar af lê.  Die  vraag
is: is dit ook die gevolge van ``die verwronge logika  van  apartheid'',  of
is dit doodeenvoudig die beginsel van moedertaalonderwys,  toegepas  tot  op
universiteitsvlak?

Swartmense toon aan hoe apartheid hulle waardigheid aangetas het, en wil  hê
dat dit herstel moet word. Afrikaanse kinders is ná  1902  geforseer  om  in
Engels te leer, en die boodskap was duidelik: as jou taal minderwaardig  is,
is jy ook minderwaardig. Watter ander boodskap  moet  swart  kinders  vandag
kry as hulle nie moedertaalonderwys kan volg tot op die hoogste vlakke  nie,
maar geforseer word om in Engels te leer?

Verlede week kon ek Minister Ben Ngubane van die  IVP  ...  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is a pity that ANC members, during the discussion of  a  topic  such  as
this, are making jokes about peanuts. This makes one wonder  what  they  are
busy with. [Interjections.]

Shortly the Minister, however, would be  making  important  decisions  about
mother tongue education at  university  level.  The  FF  has  accepted  that
Minister Asmal understands the principal of mother tongue education, but  he
still asks why, in the previous dispensation, there were  two  universities,
namely Wits and the Rand Afrikaans University, merely four  kilometres  from
one another. He asked the question as if this was part of the  warped  ideas
of apartheid.

In Belgium Minister Asmal will find that in Brussels  a  Flemish  university
and a French university are situated merely  a  few  kilometres  apart.  The
question is: Is this also as a result of the ``warped logic of  apartheid'',
or is this simply the principle  of  mother  tongue  education,  applied  at
university level?

Black people indicate how apartheid have affected their dignity,  and  would
like to have this redressed. Afrikaans children  were  forced  to  study  in
English after  1902,  and  the  message  was  clear:  If  your  language  is
inferior, you are also inferior.

What other message is black children receiving today if they cannot  receive
education up to the highest levels in their mother  tongue,  but  are  being
forced to study in English?

Last week Mr Ben Ngubane of the IFP ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Are you rising on  a  point  of
order, hon member?

Dr Z P JORDAN: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: I would  like  to  bring
to the attention of  the  House,  as  another  point  of  order  was  raised
earlier, that there is no interpretation from Afrikaans into Xhosa,  Tswana,
Zulu and Sotho. So, especially on this day it is very  weird  actually  that
our Parliament is just failing us in this  respect.  I  actually  understand
Afrikaans perfectly, so I do not need an interpretation, but I am sure  that
there are other hon members who do not. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Taking into  consideration  the
response of the House, it is quite clear that this  is  a  matter  that  hon
members in this House believe need to  be  given  attention.  As  you  know,
there is no policy on this subject at present. The policy question has  been
deferred, and I believe that it might now be necessary and  imperative  that
such a policy be put in place.

Hon member, I am going to give you a few  seconds  of  injury  time.  Please
continue.

Dr C P MULDER: Daar het vandag 'n wonderwerk gebeur. Ek laat die res van  my
toespraak en ek gebruik die laaste paar sekondes hiervoor. Die VF  pleit  al
vir jare in hierdie Parlement vir veeltaligheid  en  dat  verskillende  tale
gebruik moet word. Vandag het daar 'n wonderwerk gebeur. ANC-lede,  oor  die
spektrum heen, het ook skielik veeltaligheid ontdek. Ons  is  baie  dankbaar
daarvoor. Hulle is die Regering van Suid-Afrika. Hulle is in beheer van  die
strukture en van die geld. Ons sien  uit  daarna  dat  hulle  'n  ordentlike
vertaaldiens in hierdie Parlement inbring, en dat hulle al die tale in Suid-
Afrika die erkenning gee wat hulle verdien, nie net Afrikaans nie, maar  ook
al die ander tale.

Ek is baie dankbaar daarvoor, en ek hoop hulle sal dit daadwerklik  uitvoer.
Hulle grootste probleem met die situasie tans,  as  ek  na  ANC-lede  vandag
geluister het, is hulle eie  Minister  van  Onderwys,  Minister  Asmal,  wat
besig is met Engels, Engels, alles Engels. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: I have witnessed a miracle today. I am abandoning  the  rest
of my speech and I am using the last few seconds for this.  For  many  years
the FF has been pleading in this Parliament  for  multilingualism  and  that
different languages should be  used.  Today  a  miracle  has  happened.  ANC
members,  throughout   the   spectrum,   have   also   suddenly   discovered
multilingualism. We are thankful for that. They are the Government of  South
Africa. They are in control of the structures and the money. We are  looking
forward  to  their  implementing  a  proper  translation  service  in   this
Parliament, and that they would give all the languages in South  Africa  the
recognition which they deserve, not only in Afrikaans, but also in  all  the
other languages.

I am very thankful for that and I hope  that  they  are  going  to  do  this
immediately. The greatest problem with the situation currently, if I  listen
to the ANC members today, is that their own Minister of Education,  Minister
Asmal, is  only  busy  with  English,  English,  everything  English.  [Time
expired.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  the  hon  Mr  T
Abrahams raised the issue of an interpretation service not  being  available
in the press gallery. The situation, as I have been notified, is  that  such
a service does, in fact, exist and that those who are in the  press  gallery
can avail themselves of the interpretation service. So  I  think  that  that
situation is in hand, and is not a problem. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Are you rising on  a  point  of
order, hon member?
HON MEMBERS: We cannot hear him!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Will you please  come  back  to
the microphone, hon member? I cannot hear you, and I  do  not  think  anyone
else  in  the  House  can.  Will  you  please  address  the  House  using  a
microphone?

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chair, it has just been indicated to me by the people in  the
press gallery that they cannot hear the interpretation.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! If  the  people  in  the  press
gallery can still not hear the interpretation,  I  would  appreciate  it  if
they could get in touch with the Table so that we  can  ascertain  what  the
problem is and deal with it.

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Mr Chairperson, hon members of the House, this debate  is
significant to me and, I can safely assume, to the majority  of  the  people
of South Africa, because it addresses  the  most  important  aspect  in  the
transformation process of our  country.  South  Africa  is  a  very  diverse
society in terms of language and culture and  because  of  this,  the  whole
country is challenged to facilitate unity in diversity.

The  ANC-led  Government  has  already  made  some  significant  strides  to
facilitate, firstly, respect for all  cultures  and  languages  through  the
Constitution and legislation, and secondly, the  promotion,  protection  and
development of the existing and the almost extinct  languages,  specifically
the Khoisan languages. The coat of arms is a living example in this regard.

The legislative framework is not all that can bring  about  the  quality  of
transformation that this country needs. This is a challenge that  Government
shares with communities, as well as the private sector. We all need to  rise
to the call that the President has just made in  his  state  of  the  nation
address, ie to lend a hand in the national effort to  build  a  better  life
for all.

We call upon all the institutions, including the  private  sector,  also  to
respond to this call by recognising the importance  of  different  languages
and cultures in the services that they  provide  to  different  communities.
Banks, hospitals, courts of law,  universities  and  Parliament  are  called
upon to employ a culturally diverse group of people to cater  for  different
population groups with different cultures and languages.

A bank, a court of law and a hospital should be  ready  to  receive  an  old
African woman pensioner  who  has  never  been  to  school,  but  needs  the
services of these institutions. This is  a  citizen  with  equal  rights  as
enshrined in the Constitution, and one such right is for  all  languages  to
be given equal status and respect.

An old Xhosa woman was happy when she  was  listening  to  the  Minister  of
Finance making a policy statement in her language about  ``ukukhuphuka  kwe-
nkamnkam''  [the  raise  in  pension  benefits].  [Laughter.]  This  is  the
attitude that Parliament and other institutions should promote.

The deepening of democracy is about people having to fill in  the  forms  in
the banks using their mother tongues. The deepening of  democracy  is  about
people visiting hospitals and being  able  to  explain  their  illnesses  in
their mother tongues.

The notion of indigenous knowledge systems becomes  very  important  if  the
question of language and culture is to  be  taken  seriously  by  all  South
Africans.  It  is  important   because   it   will   facilitate   systematic
revitalisation of indigenous knowledge systems, so that we are all  able  to
understand the cultural connotations  of  diverse  languages  and  behaviour
patterns. It is when we understand each other's cultures that respect  comes
automatically.

Africans, over centuries, have evolved systems of knowledge  that  saw  them
playing  a  key  role  in  the  development  of  human  civilisation.  Under
colonisation and apartheid, as well  as  global  oppression,  these  systems
were repressed, ridiculed  and  generally  afforded  a  low  social  status.
However, these systems have continued to exist in the minds of  the  people.
They have  continued  to  inform  the  existence,  frameworks  and  meaning,
especially of  the  majority  of  those  who  we  often  regarded  as  being
illiterate.

A nation, upon attaining freedom and independence, should  as  a  rule  look
for those aspects of life that  have  sustained  it  over  time.  It  should
furthermore seek to incorporate  this  knowledge  system  into  its  current
system of education, culture and economic development.
This debate today should be seen in the context of the legislation  that  is
before the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government -  section
185 of the Constitution, which establishes a  commission  ``to  promote  and
protect the rights of cultural, religious and linguistic communities''.  The
main  objective  of  the  commission  is  to  promote  and  develop   peace,
friendship,  humanity,  tolerance  and  unity  among  and  within  cultural,
religious and linguistic communities or community councils.

[South Africa is my home. With the 11 official languages we can  revive  our
traditions which were forgotten during the apartheid regime. People used  to
adopt other languages. Instead of looking for jobs,  people  used  to  learn
other languages and do injustice to their mother tongue by  mixing  it  with
the newly learned languages.

An author wrote a book called E  antswe  letseleng.  The  author  chose  the
word, ``letsele'' to suit his style of writing. The word ``letsele''  refers
to an animal breast, whereas a human breast is referred  to  as  ``lebele''.
That is the way it is  put  in  Setswana.  [Applause.]  The  right  word  is
``lebele''[human breast], but we use ``letsele'' [animal breast] to make  it
suit the style. When one uses the word  ``lebele''  in  one's  writing,  the
reader may think that one is talking about a sorghum granule, which is  also
referred to as ``lebele'' in Setswana.  Setswana  also  has  a  rich  poetic
vocabulary. Poetry praises warm the heart of the one being praised,  and  it
also reveals the person's lineage. For example, ``Good morning, Pilane,  son
of Manosa.'' ``Son of Manosa'' reveals the person's lineage.

Seeing is believing. I am talking about things that  are  taking  place  and
which we can see. When one looks at the private  institutions  one  realises
that the unemployment rate is very high. This results  from  the  fact  that
people experience problems with the language  used  by  interviewing  panels
during interviews, filling in questionnaires and required among  other  job-
related skills.

Client services in banks are not user-friendly with regard to  our  elderly.
English and Afrikaans are used as mediums of communication.  The  forms  are
also available in these languages only. Other languages are marginalised.  I
wish the Government would open its eyes to this problem.

Let languages be equal. Let us share the  South  African  cake.  Let  us  be
united in our ideas of building South Africa. United  we  stand.  We  should
work together  for  our  own  good.  A  democratic  South  Africa  has  been
realised. Let us not sit down and do nothing to improve our conditions.]

Finally, it is necessary to align ourselves with established norms in  terms
of section 6 of the Constitution, which says: ``All official languages  must
enjoy parity of esteem and be treated equitably.'' The  status  and  use  of
indigenous languages must be enhanced. Government must take legislative  and
other  measures  to  regulate  and  monitor  the  use  of  all  11  official
languages.

Kwa pele ka maleme, kwa pele [Forward with languages,  forward!]  Siyabonga.
[Thank you.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Thank  you,  hon  member.  The
performance seems to have been much appreciated.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: The greatest nations that are  powerful  today  are  by
and large countries that promote  diversity,  as  expressed  by  culture  as
practised and languages spoken in that particular country.  This  in  itself
should be regarded as  a  national  asset.  We  seem  not  to  treasure  our
languages and  culture,  maybe  because  we  are  unable  to  mobilise  this
resource  in  our  favour  to  advance  our  own  development  or   national
interests. We all know that language is an integral part of  a  culture  and
facilitates, and shared values  and  norms  that  are  translated  into  the
educational system, which is responsible for the development of  a  body  of
knowledge that becomes a source  of  empowerment  for  individuals  and  the
country at large.

The best scientists in the world are known to have been  educated  in  their
mother tongues. Countries such  as  France  and  Russia  provide  a  classic
example in this regard. We are  not  proposing  that  our  higher  education
institutions  alone  should  provide  critical   knowledge   in   indigenous
languages, but that our public institutions,  government  agencies,  schools
and  workplaces  should  instead   form   part   of   a   knowledge-exchange
environment, through cultural and social educational activities  to  empower
ourselves.

The greatest challenge facing our country is to undo  the  effects  of  past
unjust policies that sought to divide  us  through  language.  There  is  no
doubt that language, in this case, was  utilised  effectively  as  a  strong
instrument to isolate South Africans from each other. Therefore, it  is  the
same instrument that  we  need  to  deploy  to  unite  South  Africans.  All
languages in South Africa have to be promoted by making available  resources
in this battle.

Dr S E M PHEKO: I shall use the limited time at my disposal to address  this
subject  in  the   context   of   African   languages   in   this   country.
[Interjections.] These languages are scientifically  constructed,  as  their
grammar demonstrates. They are rich in proverbs and philosophy.
It must also be appreciated that these  languages  are,  in  some  respects,
richer than English.  For  example,  for  the  English  word  ``wash'',  the
Sesotho language has several which describe the action  with  precision.``Ho
hlapa'' [washing  the  hands],  ``Ho  iphotla''  [washing  the  face],  ``Ho
ikutletsa'' [washing the feet], ``Ho hlatswa'' [washing  clothes]  and  ``Ho
itola'' [washing the body]. Some concepts in  African  languages  cannot  be
translated into English. How does  one  translate:  ``Mabewana  a  boKadi-a-
Tsholo mailangwathelwa batho ba jang polokwe kaofela?'' This proverb is  the
opposite of ``half a loaf is better than nothing''. African  languages  have
no  problems  with  the  he's  and  she's.  They  have  ``modulasetulo''  or
``mgcinisihlalo''. The quarrel about chairman is a non-African affair.

The English language says God made man in his image. African  languages  use
``umntu'' or ``motho''. The pronoun of  the  ``u''  does  not  indicate  the
gender of the person. African languages do not indicate  whether  God  is  a
man or a woman, unlike the English language, which long ago decided He is  a
he. It must be admitted that African languages suffer a  lack  of  technical
terminology. Teachers and lecturers of African  languages  in  high  schools
and universities must ensure that the language of technology is developed.

African languages can be used to teach many skills. Africans do not need  to
master English before they  learn  a  skill.  The  Germans  have  built  the
Mercedes Benz car. They do not speak  English.  The  Chinese  have  acquired
nuclear weapons. They do not speak English.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: For the information of the House,  the
term ``chairman'' is actually an abbreviation of ``chair  manager'',  so  it
has no sexist connotations. [Interjections.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chaiperson, when  my  grandfather  was  in  school  at  the
beginning of the previous century he often  had  to  carry  a  little  board
round his neck that said  ``donkey''.  This  happened  when  he  was  caught
speaking the ``kombuistaal'' Afrikaans. A Mr Sergant, the  British  Colonial
Superintendent of Education wrote to Milner on 3 June 1901, as follows:


  Our sisters and daughters must complete that part of the work which their
  male relatives  are  unable  to  accomplish.  Our  military  police  have
  gathered the greater part of the child population into  these  camps  and
  ... the opportunity during the next year of getting  them  all  to  speak
  English is golden.

Maar dit is nou iets van die verlede, sal u sê,  kom  ons  vier  vandag  die
wonder van die verhewe stand van elke moedertaal onder die nuwe Grondwet  in
Suid-Afrika. Maar, beleef ons  nie  dalk  vandag  'n  situasie  van  interne
kolonialisme, van 'n nuwe Milnerisme,  nie?  Die  Departement  van  Openbare
Werke, en ander staatsdepartmente, verbied Afrikaners byvoorbeeld om in  hul
moedertaal te skryf of te kommunikeer. Dit blyk ook dat 80% van die  klagtes
wat PanSAT ontvang teen  die  Regering  gemik  is.  Minister  Asmal  sê  die
bestaan van die RAU 4 kilometer van Wits af is ``deel van  die  gevolge  van
die verwronge apartheidsdenke'' van daardie tyd en kla dat taal in  die  pad
staan van transformasie. Verder is daar by 'n  debat  soos  vandag  s'n  net
drie Ministers teenwoordig.

Ook vir Afrikaners is hul taal, soos Roland  Barthes,  die  beroemde  Franse
literêre teoretikus, gesê het, die ``naelstringtaal'' wat hulle aan  hierdie
kontinent verbind. Die taalkundige  J  C  Steyn  beskryf  Afrikaans  as  ons
Afrikataal wat ons aan Afrika verbind.

Terwyl hy in die gevangenis was, skryf Breyten Breytenbach oor  sy  bejaarde
moeder, Ounooi, en haar taal:


  ek dra jou bene, jou kantelende bloed
  en die klanke van jou keel-
  o moeder, seën my voor u gaan!

Saam met Breyten Breytenbach vier ons vandag die klanke van die  moederkeel.
Kom ons maak erns daarmee. [Applous.] (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[But, you will say, that all is in the past now, come let us  celebrate  the
wonder of the  elevated  position  of  each  mother  tongue  under  the  new
Constitution in  South  Africa.  But  are  we  not  perhaps  experiencing  a
situation of internal colonialism, of a new  Milnerism?  The  Department  of
Public  Works  and  other  state  departments  for  example  do  not   allow
Afrikaners to write or communicate  in  their  mother  tongue.  It  is  also
apparent that 80% of the complaints received  by  PanSALB  are  against  the
Government. Minister Asmal says that the existence of RAU only 4  kilometres
from Wits is part of the results of a  ``warped  apartheid  philosophy''  of
that  time  and  complains  that  language  is  standing  in  the   way   of
transformation. Furthermore, at a debate like  this  one  today  only  three
Ministers are present.

Even for Afrikaners  their  language  is,  as  the  famous  French  literary
theoritician, Roland Barthes, said, the ``language of the  umbilical  cord''
that joins them to this continent.  The  language  professional  J  C  Steyn
described Afrikaans as our African language that binds us to Africa.

While he was in prison, Breyten Breytenbach wrote about his elderly  mother,
Ounooi, and her language, as follows:


  ek dra jou bene, jou kantelende bloed
  en die klanke van jou keel-
  o moeder, seën my voor u gaan!


Along with  Breyten  Breytenbach  we  celebrate  today  the  sounds  of  the
mother's throat. Come, let us be serious about it. [Applause.]]

[Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, Azapo applauds everything that  is  being
done to make African languages get back their positions,  which  were  taken
from them during the time of our oppression.

Azapo is saying that what we are doing here  must  not  end  in  this  House
only, but should reach the people so that they are able  to  use  their  own
languages wherever they find themselves.

The way in which  the  Government  is  promoting  these  languages,  namely,
making sure that they get their status back, is what makes us want to  know:
What is really being done? Since we got our freedom, nothing has  been  done
to make sure that these languages are being promoted, more  especially  when
we look at  the  South  African  Broadcasting  Corporation,  or  the  Public
Broadcaster.

There are some languages that are still being oppressed  and  that  are  not
used like others. The Government must intervene.

The freedom we fought for must liberate our languages, to make sure that  we
are not oppressed by  the  languages  of  those  who  oppressed  us  before.
[Applause.]]

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Mnr die Voorsitter, Max du  Preez  skryf  in  een  van  sy
artikels dat dit belangrik is om die vermoë te  kan  hê  om  Engels  te  kan
praat, te kan lees en  te  kan  skryf.  Dit  is  immers  die  taal  van  die
sakewêreld en die taal waarmee mens wêreldwyd kan kommunikeer. Du  Preez  sê
dat as daardie vermoë om in Engels te kommunikeer verkry is  ten  koste  van
'n mens se moedertaal, dan is die prys vir daardie vermoë te hoog.

'n Onlangse opname het getoon dat die bruin kinders van  Ravensmead  op  die
Kaapse Vlakte wie se lewe en wêreld, in die woorde van  Anastasia  de  Vries
``intens Afrikaans'' is, besonder trots is  op  hulle  Afrikaanswees.  Hulle
beskou hulself as  Afrikaners  en  sê  duidelik  dat  hulle  Afrikaans,  hul
moedertaal, die belangrikste voertuig vir hulle kulturele identiteit, as  'n
middel tot bemagtiging gebruik waarmee hulle  die  trots  van  Afrikaanswees
wil uitbou en ontwikkel.

Afrikaans is die taal waarin ogies toemaak om met die Oubaas te praat:


  Onse Vader wat in die tjimmel in sit
  Ons wil nou vandag vir u kom bid
  Lat u se naam ook by ons geheilig raak
  Lat u se kapteinskap hier kom staningse maak.

Dis die taal waarin ons aanklop by die ``mottas'' [vroue], waarin ons  troos
en sing en toneelspeel en gedig het vir die ``people'' en vir ons kinders  -
ook om die woede wat in ons was gedurende 'n onheilige politieke  bestel  te
verwerk.


  Valentina Teresjkova, die naam moes jy dra; toe weer Leila  Khaleb,  want
  die pyn het gevra dat daar weerwraak moes  kom.  En  die  bitterheid  van
  gister, in stormagtige gemoed het geroep om vergelding, moes gestil  word
  met bloed. Jy  word  toe  Natassjia,  net  Natassjia,  dis  al.  Met  jou
  borrelende vreugde het die gal weggeval en my  arm  gees  van  gister  is
  verryk met jou deugde.

Ja, dis die taal waarin ons konfronteer en versoen.  Aan  die  agb  Minister
wil ons sê dat die kinders in ons skole in Ravensmead en in die Karoo en  in
die Vrystaat en in die Noord-Kaap en ander dele van ons land, wil weer  sing
en dig en klavierspeel en op 'n Afrikaanse manier met  hul  vingers  in  die
verf mors en hul boodskap gaan oordra  op  Oudtshoorn  by  die  Klein  Karoo
Nasionale Kunstefees en op die Voorbrandfeeste op Klaarstroom  en  Hoeko  en
Zoar en Deysselsdorp.

Ons durf nie langer toelaat dat hulle die geleentheid ontneem word  om  weer
in ons skole hulle Afrikaanswees deur kuns en kultuur uit te leef  nie.  Dit
is nodig dat hulle, in die woorde van die agb  Adjunkminister  van  Kuns  en
Kultuur ``met ander oë na die wêreld begin  kyk  en  met  kennis  van  hulle
verlede en groter  begrip  van  die  hede,  die  pad  kan  oopbreek  na  die
toekoms''. Volgens haar is 'n volk wat sy kuns en kultuur koester,  'n  volk
met vertroue en passie en drome.

Ons in die DA wil  hierdie  sentimente  steun.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Mr Chairman, in one of his articles  Max  du  Preez  wrote
that it was important to have the ability to speak, read and write  English.
It is, after all, the language of the business world  and  the  language  in
which people communicate worldwide. Du Preez said that if  that  ability  to
communicate in English had been acquired at  the  expense  of  one's  mother
tongue the price of that ability was too high.

A recent survey showed that the coloured children of Ravensmead on the  Cape
Flats whose lives and world  are,  in  the  words  of  Anastasia  de  Vries,
``intensely Afrikaans'',  are  extremely  proud  of  being  Afrikaans.  They
regard  themselves  as  Afrikaners  and  say  unequivocally  that  they  use
Afrikaans, their  mother  tongue,  the  most  important  vehicle  for  their
cultural identity, as a means of empowerment with which they want to  expand
and develop the pride of being Afrikaans-speaking.

Afrikaans is the language in  which  they  worship  and  pray  to  the  Holy
Father:

  Onse Vader wat in die tjimmel in sit
  Ons wil nou vandag vir u kom bid
  Lat u se naam ook by ons geheilig raak
  Lat u se kapteinskap hier kom staningse maak.

It is the language in which we appeal to the ``mottas'' [ladies],  in  which
we comfort and sing and act and write poetry for  the  people  and  for  our
children - also to  process  the  anger  we  experienced  during  an  unholy
political dispensation.


  Valentina Teresjkova, die naam moes jy dra; toe weer Leila  Khaleb,  want
  die pyn het gevra dat daar weerwraak moes  kom.  En  die  bitterheid  van
  gister, in stormagtige gemoed het geroep om vergelding, moes gestil  word
  met bloed. Jy  word  toe  Natassjia,  net  Natassjia,  dis  al.  Met  jou
  borrelende vreugde het die gal weggeval and my arm  gees  van  gister  is
  verryk met jou deugde.

Yes, this is the language in which we confront and  reconcile.  We  want  to
say to the hon the Minister that the children in our schools in  Ravensmead,
and in the Karoo and in the Free State and in  the  Northern  Cape,  and  in
other parts of our country, want to once again sing  and  write  poetry  and
play the piano and mess in paint with their fingers  in  the  Afrikaans  way
and  to  communicate  their  messages  at  Oudtshoorn  at  the  Klein  Karoo
Nasionale Kunstefees and at the Voorbrandfeeste  at  Klaarstroom  and  Hoeko
and Zoar and Deysselsdorp.
We dare no longer allow them to be denied  the  opportunity  once  again  to
live out their Afrikanerdom through the arts and culture in our schools.  It
is necessary for them,  according  to  the  words  of  the  hon  the  Deputy
Minister of Arts  and  Culture,  to  start  looking  at  the  world  from  a
different perspective and  with  knowledge  of  their  past  and  a  greater
understanding of the present, to be able to open  the  way  to  the  future.
According to her a people which cherishes its art and culture  is  a  people
with confidence and passion and dreams.

We in the DA want to support these sentiments. [Applause.]]

[Mr B M KOMPHELA: Hon Chairperson, I am very glad to be  one  of  those  who
are taking part in this noble debate. Will you please allow me  to  utter  a
few words of praise  in  respect  of  my  vernacular,  because  it  is  also
represented here today. It was dark, without sunshine, but today the sun  is
shining, and our language is regarded like any other language by  everybody.
[Applause.]

The ANC encourages the use of vernacular languages and we  do  not  do  that
because of our quest for a linguistic island  where  we  will  claim  to  be
protecting our indigenous  languages.  We  are  able  to  build  the  nation
through the use of language, and we in the ANC would like to point out  that
language is a very dangerous phenomenon, because through  language  one  can
build or destroy a nation.  That  is  not  the  way  in  which  we  perceive
language. We perceive it in the manner that  would  enable  us  to  build  a
nation which has a brighter future and potential.

I am therefore glad to realise that Ms Thoko Didiza and Mr Gomomo  are  also
here today. This is because they are some of the most important leaders  who
often use the indigenous languages whenever  they  make  speeches,  so  that
even those at home can hear and appreciate that  their  leaders  are  giving
facts that are about building the nation. I would like to point out that  it
is not only today  that  we  are  able  to  speak  about  the  fate  of  our
languages.

I would like to agree with Mr Ntuli that our children  must  be  exposed  to
their indigenous languages at a very early age so that they can be proud  of
their languages. This is what the ANC appreciates. [Applause.]

When we are here in Parliament people from  other  countries  are  observing
whether or not we undermine our indigenous languages, ie Sesotho,  isiXhosa,
or isiNdebele. We normally stand up and speak like some of the  leaders  who
promote and exhibit the richness of our languages of which we our proud  and
we boast that they were not swept away by colonialism.

I would like to talk about the chorus  that  says:  We  told  you  how  many
languages there should be. It is the peace-loving black South  Africans  who
said: If these men, who are throwing stones at us, say it  is  the  language
that can bring peace and prosperity in  this  country,  then  we  allow  our
leaders to implement 11 official  languages.  The  reason  is  that  we  are
looking forward to seeing this country having a bright future, with all  its
people benefiting.

This was not done by mistake by our people, it was a very painful  decision,
because when the Afrikaners decided  that  Afrikaans  should  be  the  first
official language, we became aware of how that language was used.  There  is
one thing I would like to  commend  them  for  and  that  is  the  way  they
developed,  strengthened  and  protected  Afrikaans.  However,  they  became
conceited in order to protect it and they shoved it  down  our  throats  and
forced it on us to  such  an  extent  that  we  exploded  and  rejected  it.
[Applause.]

If only they had treated Afrikaans in the same way as  other  languages,  as
South Africa belongs to all of  us,  and  not  made  it  superior  to  other
languages, we do not think, when we look back,  that  the  things  that  had
happened in the passed would have happened.  The  ANC  takes  no  particular
language as superior to any other language, because  we  have  learned  from
the Afrikaners' mistakes and seen what happens when  one  language  is  made
superior to other languages.

Lastly, to recognise the advantages and disadvantages of a language, in  the
mining industry, where our people  could  not  speak  the  language  of  the
Afrikaners, the latter introduced a certain language called  Fanakalo.  This
language gave the Afrikaners an opportunity to call us  names  that  we  did
not appreciate. It is not a language, it  is  just  like  taking  everything
available and putting it together and calling it a language.

We need to make that our point of departure and learn from  their  mistakes.
The ANC says that it respects each and every language in this  country,  and
each language will be given a fair and necessary opportunity.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you  rising  on
a point of order?

Mr C AUCAMP: Nee, mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil weet of the agb lid  bereid  is
om 'n vraag te beantwoord. [Tussenwerpsels.] [No, Mr  Chairman,  I  want  to
know  whether  the  hon   member   is   prepared   to   take   a   question.
[Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before proceeding,  hon  member
at the podium, are you willing to take a question from the hon Mr Aucamp?

Mr  B  M  KOMPHELA:  No,  Chairperson,  I  am  not  prepared   to   do   so.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, he is not  prepared
to do so. [Interjections.] Hon member, you may proceed with your speech.

Mnr B M KOMPHELA:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  dit  is  die  manier,  houding  en
benadering van lede  soos  die  agb  Aucamp  wat  hierdie  land  in  hierdie
omstandighede laat beland het. Vandag wil hy  egter  nie  verstaan  dat  ons
besig is om die land op te bou nie.

Dit was 'n groot fout om Afrikaans op die meerderheid van ons swartmense  af
te dwing. Ons het egter gesien en het  waardering  vir  hoe  die  Afrikaners
Afrikaans verdedig, maar dit was 'n groot fout om dit op ons  af  te  dwing.
[Applous.]

Ons is nie skaam om te sê dat mense se Engels vandag beter is  as  Afrikaans
nie. Wat is die verskil tussen Engels en die Afrikaans wat  op  swart  mense
afgedwing is? Daar is geen verskil nie. Die Afrikaners was die  verdrukkers,
net soos die  Engelse  wat  die  Afrikaners  verdruk  het.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr B M KOMPHELA: Mr Chairperson, it is the manner,  attitude  and  approach
of members such as the hon Aucamp that have caused this country  to  end  up
in these circumstances. But today he does not want  to  understand  that  we
are trying to build this country.

It was a big mistake to  force  Afrikaans  on  the  majority  of  our  black
people. We have, however, seen and can appreciate  how  the  Afrikaners  are
defending Afrikaans, but forcing it on us was a big mistake. [Applause.]

We are not ashamed to say that today the people's  English  is  better  than
their Afrikaans. What is the difference between English  and  the  Afrikaans
that was forced on black people? There  is  no  difference.  The  Afrikaners
were the oppressors, just like the English who oppressed the Afrikaners.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you  rising  on
a point of order?

Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it in order  for  the
hon member to  try  and  answer  a  question  that  has  never  been  asked?
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, you are quite  free
to proceed if you think that that was the question. [Interjections.]

Mr B M KOMPHELA: Mnr die Voorsitter ... [Mr Chairman ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you  rising  on
a point of order? [Interjections.]

Mr  C  AUCAMP:  Yes,  Chairperson,  I  am  rising  on  a  point  of   order.
[Interjections.] For your sake, I will speak English.  Is  it  not  ordinary
parliamentary procedure that you have the right to ask a question? It  seems
to me that if you want to ask a question, you are often accused  of  racism,
and  whatever  other  nonsense,  before  its   content   has   been   heard!
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  member,  there  are  two
points here, the first point is as follows: The right to take a question  is
that of the speaker at the  podium,  and  only  that  speaker  can  indicate
whether he or she wants to take a question or not. That is the first part.

The second  part  is  the  right  of  the  individual  who  is  speaking  to
anticipate  what  might  be  asked,  knowing  that  different  people   from
different  political   parties   have   different   political   persuasions.
Therefore, if they wish  to  build  into  their  speeches  such  reply  that
anticipates what the question might have been, that, again, is the right  of
the individual at the podium. I hope that suffices. [Interjections.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, with all due respect, may I  ask  that  your  last
ruling be checked, because I cannot agree with that, namely that even  if  a
question is not answered, one can,  in  anticipation,  be  accused  of  what
another member thinks one was going to  say.  That  is  not  how  we  should
proceed on this matter. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I  will  take  that
up. I will certainly take it for advice and rule on it. [Interjections.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson, may I address  you  on  a  further  point  of
order?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, hon member.

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, you indicated to the hon member that  there  are
two occasions, and you have put your point  of  view  across,  but  I  would
appreciate it if you could also bring to the attention  of  the  House  that
the Rules also make provision for a  member,  in  all  fairness,  to  put  a
question to the speaker at the podium. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think that is your right  and
we have, therefore, allowed you that right. I have recognised  whomever  has
stood up to ask that, but in order that I may be able  to  indicate  whether
you may or may not put a question, I in turn have to ask the person  at  the
podium whether the question should be taken. So, that right has been  given,
but,  of   course,   under   the   conditions   which   I   have   detailed.
[Interjections.] Hon member, you may proceed.

Mnr B M KOMPHELA: Mnr die Voorsitter, baie dankie dat u my beskerm.  Ek  wil
egter net 'n punt aan die twee agb lede van die  verskillende  partye  stel.
Die Huis staan, omdat die partye baie aggressief  en  arrogant  optree  deur
weer eens vir ons te kom sê wat ons moet sê; wanneer om dit  te  sê;  en  of
dit korrek is om 'n vraag te neem, of nie. Dit is baie arrogant en  dit  wys
hierdie mense bly nog in 'n ander land, nié hier  in  die  nuwe  Suid-Afrika
nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]

Ons nooi egter al hierdie mense uit om saam met ons hierdie land op te  bou.
Hulle moet met ons saamwerk om hierdie land 'n beter plek te maak. Ons  wil,
net soos hulle, dit doen. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr B M KOMPHELA: Mr  Chairperson,  thank  you  for  protecting  me.  I  do,
however, want to make  a  point  to  those  two  hon  members  of  different
parties. There is a commotion in the House because these parties are  acting
aggressively and arrogantly by telling us, once again,  what  we  should  be
saying; when we should say it; and whether it is correct or not  to  take  a
question. That is very arrogant and it shows that  these  people  are  still
living  in  another  country  and  not  here  in  the  new   South   Africa.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

We are inviting all of these people, however, to build  this  country  along
with us. They must co-operate with us  in  order  to  make  this  country  a
better place. We want to do that, just like they do.]

[It is for that reason, therefore, that you see their being as they are.  It
is because they think that whatever is done by them cannot be  changed.  But
if it is done by me, being short in height and dark in complexion,  then  it
can virtually be changed. That is why you see them insisting so much. But  I
would like to inform them that we will participate  in  the  development  of
their language, ie Afrikaans, whether they like it or not. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

                     OMISSION OF MOTION 1 ON ORDER PAPER

                               (Announcement)


The Deputy Chairperson of Committees announced  that  Motion  No  1  on  the

     MAKING OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, with reference to the letter from the Minister of Communications of
  31 January 2002 concerning the filling of vacancies  on  the  Independent
  Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) Council  (Announcements,
  Tablings and Committee  Reports,  p  102),  the  Portfolio  Committee  on

  vacancies in accordance with section 5 of the Independent  Communications

 MULTIPARTY PARLIAMENTARY OBSERVER TEAM LEAVING FOR ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENTIAL
                                  ELECTIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF  THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the multiparty Parliamentary Observer Team will leave  for
       Zimbabwe tomorrow to observe the Zimbabwean Presidential elections;


  (2) believes that it is in the interests, not only of  Zimbabwe,  but  of
       all the people in the Southern African  region  that  the  people  of
       Zimbabwe should have the opportunity to elect their President  in  an
       atmosphere  free  from  violence  and  intimidation  and  through  an
       electoral process that is genuinely free and fair;


  (3) also notes the undertaking made by the government of Zimbabwe at  the
       SADC extraordinary summit on 14 January 2002 in Blantyre, Malawi,  as
       contained in the final SADC communiqué on the Zimbabwean Presidential
       elections;


  (4) believes that adherence to the SADC undertaking should form  part  of
       the basis on which the freeness and  fairness  of  the  elections  is
       determined;


  (5) further notes -


       (a)  the concern  expressed  by  the  SADC  summit  over  a  previous
           statement made by the Zimbabwean army  on  the  outcome  of  the
           election and the summit's urging of the government  of  Zimbabwe
           to ensure that, in  accordance  with  the  multiparty  political
           dispensation prevalent in the  SADC,  political  statements  are
           made not by the military, but by political leaders; and


       (b)  that this concern is consistent with the OAU position  regarding
           the conduct of the military in political affairs; and


  (6) believes that -
       (a)  it is in the interests of both the people of  Zimbabwe  and  the
           people of South Africa that  the  parliamentary  delegation,  in
           conjunction  with  the  other  delegations  from  South  Africa,
           undertakes  its  task  with  responsibility,  impartiality   and
           integrity; and


       (b)  the presence of the multiparty Parliamentary  Observer  Team  in
           Zimbabwe will make a constructive contribution towards  ensuring
           that the election process is free and fair.

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 16:22.
