                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms M C LOBE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes-


       (a)  the growing number of Israeli citizens who  demand  and  support
           the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside  an
           Israeli state;


       (b)  the mass rally of over 50 000 Israeli citizens calling for peace
           held in Jerusalem over the past weekend; and


       (c)  with regret the reactionary stance  taken  by  the  Likud  Party
           which opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state;


  (2) therefore calls on the leadership of the Likud  Party  to  reconsider
       its position in the interest of peace and to desist from  using  this
       issue  as  a  politically  convenient  tool  in  its  own  intraparty
       leadership contests;


  (3) commends the peace forces in Israel, drawn from every sector of  that
       society, who have  courageously  resisted  the  tide  of  bellicosity
       typified by Israel's incumbent prime minister and the party which  he
       leads; and


   (4) reiterates its call for the resumption  of  peace  talks  and  speedy
       progress towards the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian  state
       that can coexist in peace with the state  of  Israel  within  secure
       borders.
[Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the DP:


  That this House -


  (1) notes with concern the mounting evidence of  systematic  collapse  of
       health-related services in the Eastern Cape, including -


       (a)  the nonpayment of funds to hospitals and TB clinics;


       (b)  the failure of the primary school nutrition programme;
       (c)  the failure to fill vacant, funded health-worker posts;


       (d)  the delayed payment of suppliers for all essential services; and


       (e)  the nonutilisation of last year's Aids budget and the  irregular
           transfer of the funds to a Fort Hare University account;


  (2) condemns this shocking mismanagement and heartless disregard for  the
       health of the province; and


   (3)      calls for the resignation of the premier and the MEC for  Health
       in the best interests of the people of the Eastern Cape.
[Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -
  (1) learnt with utter shame of the incident in which a South African  and
       a British citizen were connected to, and therefore arrested for,  the
       trafficking of drugs to New Zealand;


  (2) further abhors the use of our territory and its people by  foreigners
       to traffic drugs, not only to South Africa but also to other  states;
       and


  (3) appeals to our communities to refuse being used in criminal  acts  by
       foreigners.

Mr L J MODISENYANE: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the calls of  President  Thabo  Mbeki  in  Oslo  yesterday  for
       imbalances in international  trade  to  be  addressed  in  order  for
       African farmers to become globally competitive;


  (2) endorses the words of President Mbeki that there is a vital  need  to
       address issues of market access, agricultural subsidies and nontariff
       barriers as well as intra-African trade;


  (3)  calls  on  developed  nations  to  share  responsibility   for   the
       impoverishment of developing countries; and


   (4)      urges these nations to contribute  to  the  development  of  the
       African continent  through  the  removal  of  unfair  subsidies  and
       barriers to trade.
[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek op  die  volgende
sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die noodfondse wat aan agt teringhospitale in die Oos-Kaap beskikbaar
       gestel is, verwelkom, nadat  dit  aan  die  lig  gekom  het  dat  die
       provinsiale gesondheidsdepartement drie maande  agterstallig  is  met
       subsidies aan die hospitale en 'n uitstaande bedrag  van  R8  miljoen
       verskuldig is;


  (2) verder kennis neem  dat  dit  onaanvaarbaar  is  dat  die  Oos-Kaapse
       gesondheidsdepartement se swak dienslewering 1 600 teringpasiënte van
       voedsel en medikasie sou ontneem; en


  (3) 'n beroep doen op -


       (a)  die President om inhoud te gee aan sy openingsrede van 2002  oor
           swak dienslewering van staatsamptenare, deur die betrokkenes  te
           ontslaan; en


       (b)  die Oos-Kaapse provinsiale regering om hulle verbintenis tot die
           daarstelling van 'n infrastruktuur te verseker, wat  soortgelyke
           krisissituasies sal verhoed.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the emergency  funding  made  available  to  8  tuberculosis
       hospitals in the Eastern  Cape  after  it  came  to  light  that  the
       provincial health department is 3 months behind in subsidies  to  the
       hospitals and an outstanding amount of R8 million is owed;


  (2)  further  notes  that  it  is  unacceptable  that  the  Eastern  Cape
       department of health's poor service delivery would  have  deprived  1
       600 tuberculosis patients of food and medication; and


  (3) appeals to -


       (a)  the President to give content to his  2002  opening  address  on
           poor service delivery by public servants,  by  dismissing  those
           involved; and


       (b)   the  Eastern  Cape  provincial  government  to   ensure   their
           commitment to the creation of  an  infrastructure,  which  would
           prevent similar crisis situations.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) vehemently rejects the recent decision of the ruling Likud  Party  in
        Israel to  deny  Palestinians  their  inalienable  right  to  self-
        determination, in defiance of  a  UN  Security  Council  resolution
        calling for the creation of an independent Palestinian state;


  (2) sees this as an Israeli resolve to maintain the present status quo of
        balkanised, Israel-dominated Palestinian cheap  labour  reservoirs,
        which will be condemned to perpetual  servitude  to  the  state  of
        Israel;


  (3) repudiates Ariel Sharon's arrogant attempts to depose the  legitimate
        leadership of the Palestinians under Yasser Arafat and to impose  a
        puppet regime of his choice; and


  (4) calls on the United States to comply with and give effect to  the  UN
        Security  Council  resolution  calling  for  the  creation  of   an
        independent Palestinian state.
[Applause.]

Ms M S MANTUA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that staff from Luthuli House, the ANC head office, and Gauteng
       Province volunteered to clean Helen Joseph Hospital  on  Tuesday,  14
       May;


  (2) further notes that this is part of the programme  of  action  of  the
       ANC, which promotes a culture of volunteerism amongst our  people  so
       that they are actively involved in accelerating change and building a
       better life for all; and


  (3) commends the initiative of  the  ANC  staff  for  embarking  on  this
       programme and leading through action.

Mayihlome! [Prepare for action!]
[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, I shall move  at  the  next  sitting  of  the
House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the interim Constitution in Schedule  4  contains  certain
       political values that are viewed as immutable and non-negotiable;


  (2) notes  that  participation  of  minority  political  parties  in  the
       legislative process in a manner consistent  with  democracy  and  the
       provision for proportional representation are some of these political
       values upon which the final Constitution on the electoral system  was
       built;


  (3) notes that any electoral reform which effectively denies proportional
       representation  and  participation  of  minority   parties   in   the
       legislative process would be repugnant to the Constitution;


  (4) notes also that in the National Assembly time allocation to  minority
       parties for debates in the House  is  inadequate  and  renders  their
       participation in  the  legislative  process  meaningless  and  merely
       symbolical;


  (5) notes that these developments are a clear indication that the  ruling
       party is bent on domineering the minority parties through means  that
       may be unconstitutional;
  (6) calls upon the Speaker of the National  Assembly  and  all  presiding
       officers to devise a mechanism in which time allocation  to  minority
       parties for debates will be  done  in  a  manner  that  will  promote
       participatory and inclusive democracy; and


 (7)  condemns the practice of allocating one  minute  or  two  minutes  to
       minority parties during debates in the  House  as  contemptuous  and
       meaningless.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, I would like you to note  that  I  gave  you
more than a minute. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I give notice  that  I  shall,  on  the  next
sitting day of the House, move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the PAC has called  for  the  release  of  its  imprisoned
       former Apla members for over seven years now and that the PAC members
       who belonged to  its  military  wing,  Apla,  during  the  liberation
       struggle fought against apartheid, declared a crime against  humanity
       by the United Nations;


  (2) notes further that it was illegal and a  violation  of  international
       law to parade freedom fighters and apartheid criminals before the TRC
       and give amnesty to the criminals of apartheid,  while  denying  that
       amnesty to freedom fighters of this  country,  and  that  the  recent
       pardon of 33 prisoners by President Thabo Mbeki is by far inadequate;


  (3) notes again that the PAC still  has  a  number  of  its  former  Apla
       members, among whom  is  Kenny  Motsomai,  serving  two  life  prison
       sentences plus 19 years in Mangaung Private Prison, and that Motsomai
       was recently assaulted by a gang of criminals in this prison; and


 (4)  therefore calls ...
[Time expired.]

Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Chair, on behalf of the ANC I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Government has signed an agreement  on  restructuring  the
       electricity distribution sector;


  (2) recognises that this aims to create an affordable and  well-regulated
       electricity market which will, in the words of Minister Mlambo-Ngcuka
       ``give a stable industry to large users, and cost-managed tariffs  to
       the poor''; and


  (3) commends the Government for its commitment to efficient  delivery  of
       electricity services to all South  Africans  and  its  strategic  and
       innovative approach to combating inefficiency.

Mrs S V KALYAN: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move on  behalf  of
the DP:


  That this House -


  (1) notes that Parliament today lit a candle in  commemoration  of  those
       living with HIV/Aids;


  (2) further notes that recent statistics  show  that  about  6 000  South
       Africans are dying every week from Aids-related illnesses;


  (3) expresses its disquiet at -


       (a)  President Mbeki's continued equivocation regarding HIV/Aids;


       (b)  the Government's therapeutic paralysis in confronting the health
           crisis in our country; and


       (c)  continued negative state action against  concerned  doctors  who
           try to provide the best treatment to people living with HIV/Aids
           and rape survivors;


  (4) commends the NGOs and  selfless  individuals  who  are  carrying  the
       burden of the fight against HIV/Aids in South Africa; and


  (5) urges the Government to put the lives of people first and loyalty  to
       the ANC and party principles second.

Hon MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Mr E T FERREIRA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the SAPS for having managed to  track  down  a  funeral
       parlour in Orlando East, Soweto, that has been  responsible  for  the
       theft of vehicles and converting them into hearses;
  (2) detests the fact that Ndlovu & Sons  Funeral  Services  had  recently
       stolen cars to the value of almost R380 000, two of which belonged to
       another funeral parlour;


  (3) regrets that the owner of Ndlovu & Sons Funeral Services is still  at
       large, running away from facing the consequences of his actions; and


  (4) believes that the seizure of such vehicles by the police will help in
       alerting other such criminals that they will also be caught soon.

Dr R H DAVIES: Chair, I will move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the announcement that Toyota intends to invest a  further  R3,5
       billion in South Africa over the next three years;


  (2) further notes that this investment will be used to upgrade facilities
       and to expand the company's manufacturing plant, a fair proportion of
       which will be for the production of a model for the global market;


  (3) commends Toyota for showing such  confidence  in  the  South  African
       economy; and


 (4)  congratulates the South African Government for its transformation  of
       the South African economy into  a  dynamic  and  competitive  global
       player.
[Applause.]

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Mr Chairman, I give notice that I shall move  on  the  next
sitting day of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the judgment of the Cape High Court yesterday that the state is
       liable to pay damages to a victim of crime where the  perpetrator  of
       the crime is at  large  as  a  result  of  a  failure  of  Government
       officials to act appropriately or correctly;


  (2) congratulates Ms Alix Carmichele  for  her  dogged  determination  in
       pursuing her case through the courts over a period of seven years  in
       search of justice and for striking a blow on behalf of the victims of
       violent crime; and


  (3) believes that more attention should be  paid  by  Government  to  the
       victims of crime and measures to alleviate their position.

        SIERRA LEONE'S FIRST PRESIDENTIAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that on Tuesday, 14 May 2002, five  thousand  polling  stations
       opened in Sierra Leone for the first presidential  and  parliamentary
       election, following the end of this country's ten-year civil war;


  (2) recognises that the pre-election period has  been  by  far  the  most
       peaceful in Sierra Leone, which in the past  has  suffered  electoral
       violence, coups and a devastating civil war;


  (3) believes  that  this  election  is  a  major  milestone  towards  the
       achievement of a peaceful, stable and democratic continent; and


  (4) wishes the people of Sierra Leone a successful and peaceful  election
       and  looks  forward  to  their  anticipated   contribution   to   the
       development of the continent.

Agreed to.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                         (The late Ms Anarine Meyer)

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House expresses its deepest condolences to Mrs Carien Meyer  and
  to Mr Roelf Meyer, a former Minister in our Government, on the  sad  loss
  of their daughter Anarine in a motorcar accident.

Agreed to.

                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members,  I  now  wish  to
give a ruling. During debate in the House on 7  May  an  exchange  of  words
took place between the hon Mr Nash and the hon Mr  Davidson.  After  himself
having withdrawn an unparliamentary expression, Mr Davidson, on a  point  of
order,  asked  whether  it  was  parliamentary  for  the  hon  Mr  Nash,  by
implication, to call him a racist.

I undertook to study the Hansard. Having done so, I would now like  to  give
my ruling. The hon Mr Nash, in his speech referring to the hon Mr  Davidson,
said the following, and I quote:


  Blacks must not get these things, he seems to think. The only  reason  he
  has complained about this, the SFF purchasing Basrah Light,  is  that  he
  cannot see blacks entering the market and his  thinking  in  this  regard
  must change.

Concerning imputations of racist  mindsets,  we  must  accept  that  in  our
political discourse, the shadow of the  hateful  policy  that  prevailed  in
this country before 1994 will continue to loom over  what  we  do  and  what
remains to be done. For that reason references to race and colour,  as  they
impact on collective policy, will inevitably and  even  necessarily  feature
in general debate and cannot, on those grounds, be construed as  racist.  By
continuing to talk  in  disparaging  and  critical  terms  about  race-based
policies, we are in fact ensuring that we  move  away  from  the  legacy  of
racism.

It is a different  matter,  however,  if  such  references  are  imputed  as
reflecting the predisposition of individuals. In  that  regard  the  Speaker
has previously pointed out that, in view of our history, it is incumbent  on
members of this House actively to take the lead to rid our  society  of  its
racist heritage.

She emphasised that members, when participating in  debates  in  the  House,
had a unique opportunity actively to inculcate and  promote  the  values  of
tolerance,  diversity  and  inclusivity,  and  indeed  should   be   setting
standards in that regard.

It is appropriate for me, on this occasion, to renew that appeal.  Returning
to the Hansard of 7 May, I note that after an interjection the hon  Mr  Nash
went on to say, and I quote him:


  My racism is pathetic but the hon member cannot get rid of his racism.

The words in the latter part of that sentence are  a  direct  accusation  of
racism against another member, and just  as  the  hon  Mr  Davidson  had  to
withdraw a similar remark on that day,  I  must  ask  the  hon  Mr  Nash  to
withdraw the words, and I quote:


  ... the hon member cannot get rid of his racism.

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, I withdraw it. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  May  I  commend  you  and  the
others. It is in keeping with the appeal by the hon Speaker  that  we  serve
as role models in this regard.

                 MEDIA DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSITY AGENCY BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, hon  members,  when  Parliament
adopted the Constitution, it  was  set  a  vital  task.  It  is  a  task  of
providing a framework of policy and law that can make our  rights  a  living
reality for all South Africans, rich and  poor,  young  and  old,  male  and
female, urban and rural, black and white.

The Constitution enjoins us to correct the imbalances  arising  out  of  our
unjust past. It enshrines the aspirations of South  Africa's  people  for  a
truly democratic  society.  In  particular,  the  Constitution  affirms  and
entrenches the right  of  all  South  Africans  to  freedom  of  expression,
embracing the freedom of the press  and  other  media  and  the  freedom  to
receive and impart information or ideas.

The Bill which I have the privilege of introducing today is one  small,  but
significant, contribution to the task  of  translating  the  aspirations  to
freedom  of  expression  into  actuality.  When  our  country  emerged  from
generations of oppression and discrimination, these rights were enjoyed,  in
practice, only by a minority of citizens.

Even today, though there has been progress,  there  are  still  millions  of
South Africans who have minimal  access  to  these  rights.  Let  us  remind
ourselves of the stark reality. To  us,  reading  newspapers,  listening  to
radio and watching television are as familiar as breathing and  eating.  But
barely half of South Africans read newspapers or magazines; in rural  areas,
less than a third. Only three quarters of South  Africans  watch  television
and millions are still beyond the reach of FM radio.

Given the distribution of wealth in our society, and the history of  neglect
of the education of the majority, the communication landscape which  Comtask
surveyed in 1993 was one of the  barriers  to  full  participation  of  most
South Africans in the media. There  were  barriers  of  different  kinds  to
people participating as  consumers,  writers,  managers  or  owners,  or  as
citizens seeking perspectives in the media to  match  their  own  experience
and aspirations.

Such was the marginalisation of the poor and of black people from the  media
world that Comtask concluded that it was necessary to  establish  an  agency
whose task would be to lower those barriers, so that, in a reasonable  time,
the imbalances should diminish.

The progress that has been made in the boardrooms and newsrooms is  welcome.
But measured against the needs of the situation, it is a drop in  the  ocean
and only a beginning.

It was from such premises and aspirations, part  of  our  founding  national
consensus as a nation, that the project  towards  a  Media  Development  and
Diversity Agency began.

The Media Development and Diversity Agency Bill embodies the principles  and
objectives that have informed this initiative from  the  start  and  through
the long consultation with stakeholders. In my budget speech two years  ago,
I enumerated the most important of those principles.

A fundamental principle is that Government, the  private  media  sector  and
international donors should mobilise resources to promote media  development
and diversity. This principle of partnership  informs  every  facet  of  the
agency provided for in the  Bill,  as  it  informed  the  long  and  complex
process of consultation with stakeholders in all sectors  out  of  which  it
has emerged.

Funding from Government, both existing  allocations  to  the  Department  of
Communications in the field of media development and a recent allocation  to
the Government Communication and Information System, will support  the  work
of the agency. The commitments by the private  sector,  which  can  only  be
formalised when the  agency  exists  and  can  enter  into  agreements,  are
tangible and significant. Indeed, without anticipating the precise  figures,
we can  say  that  there  is  no  precedent  for  private  sector  financial
contribution to a statutory agency on this scale.

I would like to thank the media houses for their  positive  approach  during
the extensive consultation process. Notwithstanding differences of  opinion,
we reached consensus on very many issues, and as I understand it,  at  least
positions that all sides were comfortable with.

This gives concrete expression to the fact that complex as the media  sector
is in terms of differing interests, there is an  overriding  consensus  that
it is in the interests of our democracy and all sectors  of  the  media  and
our society to act together to redress the imbalances of our past.

The principle of partnership is carried forward into the composition of  the
board. Six members will be appointed through a  parliamentary  process,  and
three directly by the President, taking into  account  the  funding  of  the
agency. In particular, those three appointments will include  one  from  the
commercial print media and one from the commercial  broadcast  media  sector
so that there  is  participation  in  the  board  from  the  private  sector
funders.

The Bill leaves open the inclusion on  the  board  of  a  representative  of
Government as a principal funder, and indeed the originator  and  driver  of
this initiative aimed at promoting development and  reconstruction.  Perhaps
we should note where we stand on this matter of funding.

When we assessed the gap in resources  between  the  current  situation  and
what would be desirable, it totalled R500 million over the next five  years.
After that, the requirements  would  sharply  diminish,  with  much  of  the
backlog having been dealt with. With an eye on what  was  feasible,  and  on
the understanding that developing  media  enterprises  could  find  ways  of
raising the remainder from other sources, we set the  target  at  half  that
amount, in other words R50 million a year over five years.

We have commitments amounting to just over R40 million per annum. This  does
not include what will be forthcoming in terms of material  support  such  as
training, print and distribution  facilities,  or  subsidies  and  discounts
that the MDDA will be seeking.

As far as international donors are  concerned,  we  have  proceeded  on  the
basis  that  they  will  in  the  first  instance  want  South  Africans  to
demonstrate their commitment to  make  this  initiative  work.  Having  done
that, we are preparing to approach donor agencies for their support  for  an
initiative which has already awakened interest in other parts of the world.

A further basic principle informing the MDDA initiative is  that  the  MDDA,
as a body promoting the rights to freedom of expression through support  for
media development, should have a relationship with both Government  and  the
media houses, public and private, that is arm's-length.

The Bill explicitly requires  the  agency  to  be  independent.  It  defines
independence, not in terms of the composition of  the  board,  or  where  it
draws its members from, but by the way it acts  in  exercising  its  powers.
The law requires the board to be impartial and to act -


  ... without fear, favour  or  prejudice  and  without  any  political  or
  commercial interference.

There is a strong provision dealing with  conflict  of  interest  to  ensure
that funds are not disbursed to further the interests of any member  of  the
board. Amongst the principles we affirmed from the start was that  the  MDDA
should be a body with the necessary  authority,  and  should  have  a  small
structure with the best systems of corporate governance.

Those  involved  in  the  wide  and  lengthy  consultation   preceding   the
submission of the Bill are agreed that a critical reason for the failure  of
earlier attempts to  promote  media  development  and  diversity  was  their
informal character. The law which this  Bill  proposes,  and  the  consensus
amongst stakeholders, will ensure the authority and status of the MDDA.

A  further  principle  is  that  the  MDDA  should  be  transparent  in  its
operations, in so far as  it  should  conduct  its  operations  and  provide
assistance on the basis of broad  criteria  set  out  for  all  to  see.  In
requiring that the board formulate publicly the criteria and  guidelines  it
will  be  following  in  allocating  support,  the  Bill  will  ensure  such
transparency.

A  fundamental  guiding  principle  has  been  that  the  MDDA  will  pursue
diversity, not by interfering in the content of the media, but by  promoting
development that overcomes the many barriers that until now  have  prevented
historically disadvantaged communities from being full participants  in  the
media, whether as consumers, producers or distributors.

The Bill  is  informed  by  this  conviction  that  in  dealing  with  these
structural impediments, it will act as a catalyst  to  the  emergence  of  a
more adequately  diverse  media.  In  short,  developments  should  lead  to
greater diversity. The Bill  explicitly  affirms  that  the  MDDA  will  not
interfere in the editorial content of the media.

In any case, the agency will not have the power to do  so.  Where  there  is
reference to regulations, these are guidelines for the conduct of the  board
itself in the exercise of its functions. They are not regulations  governing
the opinions of others. As befits a statutory  body  based  on  partnership,
these guidelines have the dual authority of board  and  Minister.  The  Bill
requires  effective  concurrence  in   the   prescribing   and   making   of
regulations.

The MDDA  will  work  in  partnership  with  those  agencies  that  do  have
regulatory powers, such  as  Icasa,  and  the  process  out  of  which  this
legislation emerges has involved co-operation  and  consultation  with  such
bodies.

A broadcasting project to which the MDDA gives support  could  operate  only
if granted a licence by Icasa, and Icasa retains the  sole  right  to  grant
licences according  to  its  own  criteria.  The  MDDA  will  address  those
conditions which have undermined the emergence and, initially, the  survival
of community and small media projects.

The experience of recent years has made it quite clear that the granting  of
a  licence  does  not  translate  automatically  into  viability;  that  the
transfer of equipment does  not  ensure  sustainability  and  survival;  and
indeed that cash grants on their own will not ensure  lasting  health  in  a
media enterprise.

Capacity-building  and  training  in  all  areas  of  media  production  and
distribution therefore receive strong emphasis in the mix  of  support  that
will come from the MDDA. By providing a powerful impetus to the  development
of  community  media  and  small  commercial  media   amongst   historically
disadvantaged sectors of our society, the MDDA  will  promote  diversity  in
our media as a whole.
Small as this initiative may be in relation to the legacy to  be  addressed,
we are confident that it will act as  a  powerful  catalyst.  The  community
media sector of today will tell one that it  has  acted  historically  as  a
training ground from which journalists,  media  workers  and  managers  have
moved into the mainstream commercial media.

By promoting a reading culture amongst South Africans,  a  bigger  community
sector will expand interest in media products and  processes  generally,  to
the benefit of the established media.

It will enlarge the pool of creativity  and  communications  skills  in  our
country. In short, a vigorous and  expanding  community  media  sector  will
have consequences far beyond its own sphere, to the benefit  of  the  entire
media sector of South Africa and all our citizens.

All our research  points  to  an  immense  hunger  amongst  our  people  for
information which they can use to improve their  lives  and  which  empowers
them to have an effective say in governing. It shows, too, that this  hunger
is being inadequately met, for various reasons, by our  media  as  currently
configured.

In passing this Bill, this House will create a framework for  a  partnership
of Government and media that will create  more  implements  with  which  the
people of South Africa can plough the fields of freedom. It will  strengthen
their hands as informed and active agents in  the  reconstruction  of  their
country and the development of a just and prosperous society.

I would like to thank the  portfolio  committee  and  its  chairperson,  Nat
Kekana, for all the work that they have done from their  side  in  order  to
ensure that the  Bill  is  in  the  House  today.  The  Bill  has  benefited
substantially from the legislative experience and wisdom  of  the  portfolio
committee. The public hearings which the committee held, both on  the  draft
position paper  and  the  Bill  itself,  made  it  possible  for  all  those
interested in media development to play a part in this initiative. The  Bill
is  the  outcome  of  all  these  inputs  and  those  of  many  others   who
participated in the process. I wish to thank all those who have  contributed
to this democratic initiative, and I  call  upon  this  House  to  give  its
assent to this Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is the  most  thank  you's
the hon the Minister has made.

Ms M SMUTS:  Voorsitter,  ons  verneem  die  studente  van  die  Departement
Joernalistiek aan die Universiteit van Stellenbosch is  in  die  galery,  en
met u verlof verwelkom ons hulle graag.  [Chairperson,  we  understand  that
the  students  from  the  Journalism  Department  of   the   University   of
Stellenbosch are in gallery and, with your  permission,  we  would  like  to
welcome them.]

When  a  government  decides  that  the  case  for  media  diversity  is  so
compelling that a subsidy system should be set up, it should be willing  and
able to fund both the subsidies and the body that dispenses them and to  ask
us, as Parliament,  to  vote  the  necessary  funds.  Government  is,  here,
however setting up a body, the MDDA, which  it  has  made  clear  it  cannot
fund.  Its  contribution,  it  has  said,  will  be  limited   to   existing
allocations to departments such as Communications. It is not  clear  to  me,
from what the Minister has just said, whether more will now be  forthcoming.
But, what is clear is that the money for the new scheme, in  practice,  will
come from the commercial, print  and  broadcasting  sectors.  Originally,  a
levy was to have been imposed.  The  industries  dissuaded  Government  from
such a course. Now they will fund it by way  of  voluntary  agreements  with
the MDDA Board, concluded in terms of clause 21 of the Bill.

It must be noted that the industries are at present operating in an  anaemic
environment where adspend, their lifeblood, has  thinned,  and  where  costs
for items such as paper  have  skyrocketed.  The  print  media  association,
nevertheless, already runs a print development  unit  which  helps  start-up
papers. The industries are operating also in an environment  changed  beyond
recognition from the time when Comtask recommended an  arm's-length  subsidy
system.

By mid-2000, on the GCIS's own figures, 12 out of the 30  of  the  country's
mainstream editors were  black.  Debates  on  ownership  and  control  today
centre on such questions as whether Saki Macozoma's cash-flush  empire  does
or does not constitute an empowerment  company  to  a  degree  which  should
satisfy the broadcasting regulator that diversity would be served before  it
will allow Mr Macozoma to buy up more FM  stations,  in  the  light  of  the
existing - probably outdated - statutory prohibitions  on  concentration  of
ownership. Those are the debates today.

But, in spite of these realities the hon the Minister, in  his  foreword  to
the position paper on the MDDA, trots out the tired old communist idea  that
South Africa is still burdened by the special form of colonialism  that  has
shaped our country, and that the nature of the public  discourse  is  shaped
by patterns of ownership and control, such that the poor  and  disadvantaged
remain marginalised.

The position paper itself assures us that the legacy  of  apartheid  remains
and that significant  currents  of  thought  remain  marginalised.  Now,  no
prizes for guessing  which  current  of  thought  is  destined  for  greater
exposure. Government's goal, it seems to  me,  is  essentially  to  get  the
private sector to fund state media, and not for nothing, in my view, is  the
GCIS working on a satellite network for community radio stations.

Of course our ruling party thinks that it is the state.  In  fact  the  MDDA
created by  this  Bill  strikes  me  as  the  perfect  illustration  of  the
phenomenon which was once  described  in  one  of  those  deathless  Mail  &
Guardian columns by  Craig  Tanner,  which  were  written  to  the  hon  the
Minister's good self under the  rubric  of  Letters  to  the  Best  Man.  He
credited the Minister with, I quote, ``achieving the  synthesis  which  gave
us Thatcherism-Stalinism, the hallmark of the Mbeki regime''.

Is that not wonderful and is this  not  a  wonderful  illustration  of  this
remarkable  doctrine  of  Thatcherism-Stalinism:   the   profits   of   free
enterprise and free speech funding  the  thought  control  of  the  vanguard
party?

Government's goal goes, or went, beyond this, however. It wanted  the  MDDA,
according to its position paper,  to  fund  research  and  stimulate  public
debate on issues  including  ownership  and  control  patterns,  empowerment
trends, concentration, cross-ownership, limits on foreign  ownership  -  you
name it.

In other words, the industries must pay for enquiries that could  result  in
their own decimation. Until now they got  their  inquisitions  free,  as  it
were,  courtesy  of  the  taxpayer,  who  indirectly  forked  out  for  such
exercises as the Human Rights Commission's so-called media  racism  inquiry,
which,  of  course,  represented  the  ``national''  part  of  the  national
democratic revolution.

It would truly be a triumph of Thatcherism-Stalinism to  get  the  media  to
pay  for  the  next  stage  of   the   revolution,   but   fortunately   our
constitutional order is based on a different doctrine altogether. In so  far
as broadcasting is concerned, section 192 of the  Constitution  requires  an
independent authority to regulate broadcasting in  the  public  interest  to
ensure fairness and the diversity of views.

In the authoritative opinion of Adv  Gilbert  Marcus  and  Alfred  Cockrell,
written at the time the DP and the IFP were at loggerheads with the  ANC  on
the  constitutionality  of  the  Broadcasting  Bill  in  1998,  section  192
requires  that  the  broadcasting  authority   must   be   responsible   for
controlling and governing broadcasting activities in South  Africa.  Such  a
requirement, say the advocates,  would  be  meaningless  if  other  agencies
could also regulate broadcasting. It follows that that  section  effectively
disempowers  Parliament  from  authorising  any  agency   other   than   the
broadcasting authority to regulate broadcasting in the public  interest.  In
other words, that section deprives us in Parliament  of  the  competence  to
enact legislation which empowers any other agency to  regulate  broadcasting
activities.
Ensuring fairness and  a  diversity  of  views  broadly  representing  South
African society is the primary goal of regulation in  the  public  interest.
Regulation of matters relating diversity is therefore the sole  preserve  of
the regulator, Icasa, and the Democratic Alliance argued that  the  role  of
the MDDA must, of necessity, be limited to support for Icasa in  respect  of
broadcasting. Icasa's duties in  respect  of  diversity  have  already  been
legislated. The duties and objectives include a plurality of views,  control
by a diverse range of communities, diverse services  for  all  language  and
cultural groups, ownership and control by previously  disadvantaged  groups,
programming  for  grassroots  and  developmental  issues  including   health
community needs, determining priorities within the  community  radio  sector
and so forth.

It was therefore quite clear that the MDDA, as the Bill  stood,  would  have
encroached on the broadcasting regulator's constitutional terrain,  and  all
clauses   relating   to   research   into   diversity,   hearings,    public
consultations, meetings with  the  media  industry  and  recommendations  to
Government and industry were accordingly  removed.  It  should  in  addition
have been made crystal clear that the MDDA acts in  a  capacity  subordinate
to and supportive of Icasa.

In fact, such a supportive role could have been of great value to Icasa  and
I wish that we could have completed the clean-up of  the  Bill  so  that  we
could have supported it. Yes, I do. A genuinely disinterested  agency  could
have done so much better than  the  Department  of  Communications'  support
programme for community radio stations.

We heard from the  sector  during  hearings  how  lorryloads  of  unexpected
equipment had been known to arrive at radio stations' doors.  Now,  that  is
simply wasteful  and  unacceptable.  However,  sadly,  the  ANC's  redrafted
objectives clause falls well short of the proper approach to Icasa.

However, let me immediately say that  the  majority  party  did  better;  in
fact, the ANC MPs did well in respect of section 16 of the  Constitution  by
requiring consistency with its provisions upfront and  moreover  stipulating
that the MDDA must not interfere in the editorial content of media.

Even an MDDA, an agency whose role is limited to financial and  facilitative
support for small media, inevitably involves evaluation of  programming  and
content as part of a  business  plan,  especially  when  the  goals  are  so
social. It follows that the MDDA must be genuinely independent.

Indeed, the creation of criteria for funding was taken out of  the  hon  the
Minister's hands and put into those of  the  board  alone,  for  one  brief,
shining week at any rate. But, sadly, the Minister took  his  effective  co-
regulatory powers back the next week by ensuring that  only  he,  much  like
the Minister of  Communications  in  the  case  of  telecommunications,  can
ultimately gazette the regulations. We got that close.  But,  the  beautiful
language about independence from political interference in clause 2  is  now
eroded and spoiled. In addition, it is  tacitly  understood  that  the  GCIS
functionary will serve on the board alongside  the  representatives  of  the
commercial sectors. These three will be presidential  appointments,  sitting
with six appointed by us.

The fact that the Minister, who coregulates the  criteria  for  small  media
funding, is the very person tasked with propagating Government  information,
and that the GCIS sits on a supposedly independent board, is simply  fraught
with danger for media freedom. The idea that the GCIS  has  an  interest  in
the media environment, because that is where it needs  to  achieve  exposure
of  Government's  programmes  and  positions,  has   been   part   of   this
Government's thinking since the Comtask process. We argue  that  it  has  no
logical role in shaping the  media  environment.  On  the  contrary,  it  is
inherently dangerous to allow this Ministry to preside over the creation  of
the MDDA.

We are happy to have contributed to a better Bill and we compliment our  ANC
colleagues for many excellent amendments. But, in the end we have to  oppose
because those coregulatory powers have been  placed  in  the  hands  of  the
Minister who propagates Government information. [Applause.]
Mr N N KEKANA: Chairperson, I am really disappointed that the  DP  chose  to
simply oppose this Bill based on an ideological position.

The portfolio committee  conducted  public  hearings  and  also  received  a
number of written submissions. Right at the outset, we would like  to  thank
all the stakeholders who made contributions. Indeed, the public  submissions
made a  difference.  They  were  particularly  helpful  when  the  committee
deliberated and we were proud to table a  much  improved  amended  Bill.  We
must also thank the leadership of the Minister, the CEO and  staff  of  GCIS
for their contribution in ensuring that we have a Bill that is able to  open
up the media to many of our people.

It was noted by academics O'Dubhchair, Scott and Johnson in a  paper  titled
``Building a knowledge infrastructure  for  learning  communities'',  and  I
quote:


  Communities of the 21st  century  cannot  compete  without  advanced  ICT
  applications and without a commitment to build on a continuing process of
  learning, knowledge and action.

We believe that this Media Development and Diversity Agency Bill today  will
contribute towards building a new knowledge infrastructure  that  will  give
local communities greater responsibility for their future.  Our  communities
must be part and parcel of the change taking place, not only in our  country
but also at a global level.

Section 16 of our esteemed Bill of Rights bestows upon every citizen of  the
Republic of South Africa the right to freedom of expression, which  includes
the freedom to receive and impart information or ideas. This  Bill  that  we
are debating today is constitutional. Not only does it  satisfy  section  16
of the Constitution, but it also covers no fewer than  four  other  sections
in the Bill of Rights. It also satisfies section 192 of the Constitution.

The DP is not listening to what the Minister has said. This is  in  relation
to section 192. The Minister said - perhaps the  DP  needs  a  copy  of  the
Minister's speech - one cannot simply rely on licensing alone. This  is  not
based on some experience in the USA or somewhere else. It is  based  on  our
concrete experience here in South Africa. We have licensed  community  radio
stations. We have allowed  community  media  and  newspapers  in  particular
actually to collapse in front of our eyes. We cannot  leave  that  situation
to chance. We are creating an MDDA that is going to  make  a  difference  in
the communities.

Icasa licenses, and the MDDA steps in and looks into  how  best  to  sustain
the licence itself. Throughout the course of the  history  of  our  country,
the poor rural communities, women and other  marginalised  communities  have
all by default fallen into an  information  loop,  an  information  gap,  an
information divide. They have truly  been  relegated  to  the  outskirts  of
society. It is no wonder that the poverty and abject conditions under  which
they live persist to this day and are generally ignored by the media.

Across the globe it is accepted that we  now  live  in  what  is  called  an
information society and once one does not have access  to  information,  one
is disempowered and disadvantaged. A large proportion of our  population  is
disempowered and disadvantaged because they are not able and have the  means
to access information, thereby perpetuating their own disempowerment. It  is
this which  the  Media  Development  and  Diversity  Agency  Bill  seeks  to
redress.  Today  in  South  Africa  freedom  of  expression  and  access  to
information is enjoyed by an elite, whilst many  still  do  not  enjoy  this
right or the fruits of their hard-won rights which are now enshrined in  our
Constitution.

If people do not have information, how will  they  know  what  is  happening
around them? How will they make  a  contribution?  This  is  basically  what
democracy is all about. Our understanding of democracy  is  based  primarily
on this, that people must be informed so that they can make better  choices.
Once  our  people  have  access  to  information  and  to   the   means   of
communication, there will be numerous encouraging  benefits  and  advantages
to society as a whole. Our society will operate  in  a  more  inclusive  and
cohesive fashion as all sorts  of  information  about  various  initiatives,
situations and opportunities are shared in and between communities.  We  can
all see that the MDDA will bring opportunities and  hope  to  the  lives  of
many of our people, especially those in  rural  areas,  as  we  continue  in
reconstructing and developing our country.

The agency itself will,  through  its  programmes,  help  to  promote  media
diversity and development for the benefit  of  all  South  Africans  and  we
should not apologise for this or be ashamed of this, as the  DP  would  have
us be. It will be a resource for the whole nation  and  be  a  catalyst  for
much-needed media transformation, so that  all  South  Africans  may  become
better informed and better able to exercise their democratic rights.

It  will  promote  development  by  creating  an  enabling  environment  for
sustainable  media  diversity,  thereby  deepening   democracy.   It   will,
therefore, increase access to media for all citizens, both as consumers  and
producers. It will particularly ensure  that  the  voices,  aspirations  and
images of  marginalised  sectors,  such  as  women,  the  youth,  illiterate
people, rural people and people with disabilities, are heard and seen.

The MDDA will  be  a  statutory  body  which  will  be  independent  of  the
Government, the media, the industry, donors and  the  beneficiaries.  As  we
have just explained, the MDDA will address the inequalities  and  imbalances
in the media environment and will have nothing to do with the content. I  am
glad that the DP is crediting the ANC for inserting this particular clause.

It is very clear in the Bill that the agency must  not  interfere  with  the
editorial content of the media. This has been a very consistent line  argued
by the ANC, and we can even take it back to Comrade Walter Sisulu in one  of
the first broadcasts of Radio Freedom. This has been  our  argument  and  we
have been very consistent in so far as this position is concerned.

Notwithstanding this patent clarity, the DP has harped  on  and  on  in  the
committee, public hearings and even in the media, to anyone who  would  stop
and listen, about how this is not the case. [Interjections.] They have  said
so! They argue that, in fact, this agency is set up as a propaganda  machine
to  tell  people  what  to  write  and  broadcast   and   what   to   think.
[Interjections.] This is what they say. How noble of them  to  pretend  that
they are the guardians of free speech. They always argue like this -  access
to information.

Let us remind them of their past. They do not want us to  talk  about  their
past, but they played a role  in  the  apartheid  colonial  system  and  its
virtual propaganda machinery. Together with the apartheid  government,  they
controlled   what   South   Africans   wrote,   broadcast    and    thought.
[Interjections.]

This is what Mr Ellis's party has done. [Interjections.] The DP  has  always
been the party of the elite few. They have not changed, despite  parading  a
few  black  faces  at  their   conferences   and   playing   Kwaito   music.
[Interjections.]
They are the elite who, by  and  large,  currently  control,  own  and  have
access to the media. [Interjections.] Of course! The  reason  why  they  are
opposed to this Bill in  this  House  today  is  that  they  are  afraid  to
relinquish such control. [Interjections.] What Dene Smuts  was  arguing  for
today  was  to  retain  the  status  quo;  that  was  all  she  argued  for.
[Interjections.]

It is fine that a few black people can own the  media,  be  in  control,  be
editors ... By the way, the hon member did not  mention  that  some  of  the
editors, like Kaizer Nyatsumba, are now in the UK  or  somewhere.  The  Cape
Times here used to have a black editor. Where is that editor today? So,  she
should not quote statistics to try to satisfy  her  argument  here.  She  is
opposed to this Bill because it seeks to address the imbalance of the  elite
having full control.

Let me also point out that we have noted what the  DP  has  said  about  the
powers of the Minister here. The Bill reads, and I quote:


  The Minister may,  in  consultation  with  the  board,  make  regulations
  regarding any matter that is required or permitted to  be  prescribed  in
  terms of this Act.

This is not unusual, it is a universal practice that  regulations  are  made
by executives and ministers in various countries.  This  is  a  right  which
they  earned  through  elections.  I  do  not  know  who  can   make   laws.
[Interjections.]

It is clear  that  the  ANC  and  the  DP  have  a  fundamental  ideological
difference. There is nothing we can do to make the DP move  away  from  this
ill-advised and ill-informed position. [Interjections.]

If there is a regulatory authority or agency, the  general  approach  is  to
find  a  way  in  which  this  body  may  make  a  contribution,  either  in
consultation with the Minister or after consultation with the Minister.

Now, what the ``after consultation'' means is that the Minister can  go  and
talk to them and, of course, take their point of  view,  and  thereafter  go
and make regulations  ``in  consultation''.  This  is  the  legal  position.
Whoever one may contact will tell one this. ``In  consultation''  means  the
Minister has to take the views of the board, but the principle here is  that
governments are there to govern. Ministers  are  there  to  ensure  that  if
there is a gap in the law - because this House does not sit every day  -  if
there is a need to make  regulations,  one  makes  these  regulations.  That
power cannot be delegated to  some  particular  structure.  [Interjections.]
No, that is not the  case.  [Interjections.]  It  is  because  that  is  not
Government. That is not  the  executive.  It  is  a  body  that  relates  to
Parliament and the executive itself.

I do not know exactly  how  the  opposition  seeks  to  approach  this  very
serious issue. Even regarding the section 92 body in the  Constitution,  and
this whole question of regulation, it is regulation in relation to the  work
that they are doing. But when  we  talk  about  the  gap  in  the  law,  the
Minister has that power. The opposition should go back to  the  Broadcasting
Act, the one that was passed. They should go back to it and then  they  will
find exactly what we are talking about.

But it is very clear that in all the media and communications Bills that  we
have considered and passed in this house, there  is  an  ideological  divide
here, and I think there is  very  little  that  we  can  do  about  it.  The
opposition is espousing conservative, liberal views, whilst  ours  are  more
revolutionary and democratic. We are not only concerned  about  Sandton;  we
are concerned about the people in Alexandra whom the opposition only  visits
when they contest elections. That is the point. [Interjections.]

We are not only concerned about the Sandton people,  but  also  about  rural
areas. Many of us in the ruling party happen to be what Sol  Plaatje  called
the ``people of two worlds''. We have one foot in the urban  world  and  the
other in the rural world. That in itself gives  us  a  unique  insight  into
what our people really want. The opposition says the status quo must  remain
and we do not want to accept that argument. [Interjections.]  That  argument
falls away and we are not willing to accept it.

Lastly, the Media Development and Diversity  Agency  Bill  is  for  all  our
people. It is not only about whether we are going to give them  licences  as
far as community radio is concerned, about whether we are going to let  them
struggle. I met the editor of Alex Times and he is  struggling  to  survive.
Caxton has just abandoned them. Once this Bill is in place,  the  MDDA  will
be able to go to that editor  and  tell  them  that  we  are  not  going  to
interfere in his editorial content, but they are going  to  ensure  that  he
survives, because Alex Times must reflect the  views  of  the  community  of
Alexandra, which is my constituency.

Lastly, there is one other matter that one  has  to  address  right  at  the
outset. We have tried our best to ensure that we have an agency where  money
is not going to go to the administration but to projects that are  going  to
be approved by the board. We are going to make sure that we popularise  this
Media Development and Diversity Agency Bill to all communities, and we  will
ask GCIS also to reach out to communities so that they know  that  there  is
this particular agency that  exists,  an  agency  that  will  help  them  to
contribute to national debates, because that is the voice that is missing.

The pessimism of the elite is not reflected in communities  on  the  ground.
We  want  those  views  to  come  up  in  national  debates.  Those  student
journalists from Stellenbosch in the gallery must be able to  reach  out  to
all those communities. By the way, those journalism students  should  please
learn other official languages so that  when  they  go  into  townships  and
rural areas they do not rely on interpretations, but  on  their  own  first-
hand interaction with communities so that they can give these communities  a
voice in all the newspapers and radio stations they will be  working  under.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon members are  continuing
a second debate in the back there.

Ms S C VOS: Chairperson, when describing certain legislation in our  caucus,
the IFP will sometimes refer to a Bill as being in the ``yes,  but''  mould.
The Media Development and Diversity Agency Bill is  a  typical  example.  On
the  one  hand,  who  could  possibly  object,   in   our   resource-skewed,
postapartheid society, to the  promotion  of  an  enabling  environment  for
media development and diversity?

On the other hand, in the real world of politics all over the world, we  all
know the dangers of governments putting their sticky fingers  into  anything
to do with the media in all its multiplicity of forms. As  an  example,  and
one that springs readily to mind, let us ponder for a moment  the  world  of
Mr Robert Mugabe in neighbouring Zimbabwe - not  for  him  the  correct  and
natural tensions that apply to relations between politicians and  the  press
in democracies around the globe.

Early  on  in  his  now  imperial  presidency  he  decided  that  having  an
independent press, voicing critical opinion from time to time about him  and
his party, was an inconvenience he would rather not have. It is much  easier
to have state-controlled TV, radio and  print  media,  and  party  hacks  at
their helm, dancing to the tune of their political masters. Of  course,  now
he has gone one step further, and he locks up the brave souls  who  do  dare
to offer the citizens of Zimbabwe  a  glimpse  of  the  goings-on  in  their
nation, not authored and tailored by Zanu.

Among journalists there is a saying that goes: ``Show  me  a  country  where
there is famine and a free press.'' As famine looms large  in  Zimbabwe,  it
is perhaps no coincidence that Mr  Mugabe  is  host  to  the  exiled  former
Ethiopian dictator, who also brought terror and starvation to his  people  -
no doubt a case of birds of a  feather  flocking  together,  as  the  saying
goes.

From the outset, the IFP made its views well  known  about  this  particular
piece of legislation. It supported  the  principle  of  the  Bill  and  even
decided to go along with the concept  of  a  public-private  partnership  to
achieve its goals. But - and here is our big but - we  want  the  Government
to play an arm's-length role.

When a Bill involving the media is introduced directly from  the  Presidency
of  a  country,  as  this  one   is,   politicians,   certainly   opposition
politicians, take a long, hard look at it,  and  so  do  vigilant  citizens,
democrats all, as was evident from the  many  submissions  received  by  the
Communications committee.

When allocating funds for and establishing community  and  commercial  media
and research projects, the temptation  for  party-political  considerations,
in whatever guise, to come to the fore is just  too  great.  We  are  human,
after all.

In its first draft, the role to be played by the GCIS jumped off  the  pages
of the Bill. The hand of Government was made all too clear.  The  Minister's
slip, so to speak, was showing. Much gnashing of teeth  later,  and  to  the
considerable credit of the committee and its chairperson, this is no  longer
the case. But,  attempts  to  disqualify  employees  of  Government,  public
servants, from serving on the board through the back door failed.

However, all is not  lost.  Clauses  have  been  inserted  with  the  stated
intention of ensuring that the board, as proposed,  acts  independently  and
without any political or commercial interference, as the  hon  the  Minister
so rightly said. Office bearers and employees  of  any  party,  movement  or
organisation of a party-political nature are disqualified  from  appointment
to the board of the agency.

This is not exactly what the IFP wanted,  but  after  consideration  we  are
prepared to live with it. This is as good as it is going  to  get  in  round
one. It is now up to the  democratic  process  to  work.  In  our  qualified
support for this initiative, it is now up to us all and  to  those  whom  we
appoint to undertake this task to ensure that the media  and  the  research,
which will flow from this initiative, are indeed independent and  that  they
do indeed strengthen democracy in our country.

Throughout history, it is well recorded  that  governments  have  sought  to
impose controls on the flow of information and opinions in furtherance of  a
range of state interests. A free and independent media is known to be a  key
element in contributing to transparent and accountable governance.  The  IFP
can only hope that, as we pass this Bill today,  we  are  indeed  positively
contributing to the development of this reality throughout South Africa.  We
must, however, have no illusions that governments and  the  media  are  like
oil and water. They do not mix, and they should not be made to mix.

Mr M G PHADAGI: Chairperson, it seems that when we are  debating  this  Bill
we are debating it as if we are strangers in this  country.  A  person  will
come here and talk English and go back, so that she is  recorded  as  having
spoken on behalf of her party.
I want to assist this House  by  introducing  into  the  debate  the  actual
happenings in our country. I want to tell people about a town which  is  the
home to not less than 800 000 people. That is almost a  million.  It  has  a
university and several colleges. This town  is  in  the  rural  province  of
Limpopo, as are many  other  towns  in  that  province  and  also  in  other
provinces.

People in this town do receive newspapers every day, in  the  afternoon,  of
course. They queue until the van from Johannesburg  brings  the  newspapers.
They read about issues happening all over the country, but one thing is  for
sure - issues in their  town  are  not  mentioned.  When  their  issues  are
mentioned, one finds that there is excitement and a stampede  to  buy  these
papers.

Occasionally one finds that other issues in the  rest  of  the  country  are
interesting to the people of this  town.  They  are  used  to  buying  these
newspapers, but issues in their town such as  community  matters,  funerals,
weddings, politics and sport are not in the papers. This is a town which  is
serviced by another city which is not less than 500km  away.  Unfortunately,
the news they are getting is from one source, a  company  which  produces  a
lot of different newspapers. When one reads one newspaper, it  is  like  one
has read all of  the  newspapers  in  South  Africa.  They  speak  the  same
language and have the same style.

There is a need for the town I am talking about  to  have  a  voice  in  the
South African media. Alternative commercial  newspapers  in  this  town  are
started from time to time, but their lifespan is short and they  do  not  go
beyond their second birthday. Why?  Because  they  are  competing  with  big
companies, who have a monopoly  of  the  market.  Some  of  these  companies
belong to families which were promoted during apartheid times. These  family
newspapers are the only voice for the whole country.

People's agendas in different towns are set by these families which own  the
newspapers. These newspapers with different titles belong to  one  group  or
section of our community, and have remained the same ever  since  they  were
established. But at least since 1994 there have been some changes  here  and
there. One sees a black face managing or as editor, but still  reporting  to
the very same school of thought.

I need to warn some of my colleagues in  the  portfolio  committee  that  if
their constituencies, to whom they are preaching every day, could hear  them
saying that we should stop this, they would definitely not get the votes  of
those constituencies again. They would not come back here. [Interjections.]

Those people are really fighting to have  a  voice.  The  small  number  who
voted for those members are convinced that they are  going  speak  on  their
behalf. So if Dene  Smuts  comes  here  and  says  that  English  should  be
stopped, she is not representing those constituents at all. [Applause.]

Fortunately enough, the Constitution ... [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Essop, they do not want your voice, they want our voice.

Mr M G PHADAGI: Chairperson,  the  Constitution  of  this  country  is  very
clear. It says, and I quote:


  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes


  (a) freedom of the press and other media;


  (b) freedom to receive or impart information or ideas ...

The Reconstruction and Development Programme of  1994  tells  us  that  open
debate and transparency in Government and society are  crucial  elements  of
reconstruction and development. This requires an  information  policy  which
guarantees the  active  exchange  of  information  and  opinions  among  all
members of society.

The RDP goes on to say that the democratic Government must seek  to  correct
the skewed legacy  of  apartheid,  in  terms  of  which  the  media  was  an
instrument of NP policy, community media were repressed, private media  were
concentrated in the hands of a few monopolies, and a  few  individuals  from
the white community determined the contents of the media.  The  RDP  further
says that new voices and genuine competition,  rather  than  a  monopoly  of
ideas, must be encouraged. This is a document all of us respect.

Helo bammbiri li khou amba fhungo la vhukuma line heyi khoro ya vha  hu  uri
yo dzulela lone hafha. [That paper is portraying the real  issue  that  this
House is debating here.]

The good news for the people in the town I referred to earlier is  that  the
Government has taken the bold step of setting up an independent agency  that
will address some of their problems of media development  and  diversity  in
South Africa, called the Media Development and Diversity Agency.

This agency will help people  to  own  their  own  newspapers,  particularly
those marginalised by  race,  language,  sex,  geographic  location  and  so
forth, because a newspaper is like any other business. This agency is  going
to  assist  us  to  run  those  businesses  by  assisting  those  people  in
Thohoyandou and many other towns to acquire loans at a  low  interest  rate,
and ensuring that proper business plans are drawn up, which  will  determine
the specific steps to be followed that will make the business a success.

The money acquired will also assist with the training of the staff, so  that
they will be able to run their businesses properly. It will also be used  to
commission media research  to  assess  needs  and  fund  research  projects.
Progress is also going to be monitored that  addresses  issues  relating  to
media development and diversity. That is good  news  for  the  people  I  am
talking about.

The MDDA Bill will ensure that  information  will  be  disseminated  to  all
communities, especially to the poor and marginalised ones. The  ANC  is  the
party which always has and will continue to represent the interests  of  the
poor and marginalised communities, hence we give this Bill  our  unequivocal
support.

[It is said that to be familiar with  what  is  happening,  one  has  to  be
informed. So we are told to stand up, since help is available to  those  who
help themselves. Today the sun is shining on us. There  is  a  saying:  ``An
opportunity comes only once''. The department has opened its doors  for  us.
The only thing remaining is  that  we  must  work  hand  in  hand  with  the
department in our villages. We should get hold of these newspapers  that  we
are encouraged to have. If we  do  have  them,  today  will  never  be  like
tomorrow. We will be able to tell our children  what  is  happening  in  our
country. Moreover, we will know the agenda of the town  we  are  living  in.
Then we would not be told what to do by  people  who  are  miles  away  from
where we live.
Now the time is ours. We are supposed to participate and make sure  that  as
people, we can be counted amongst those who distribute the  newspapers  here
in South Africa.]

Mnr J J DOWRY: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister, in  'n  jong  ontwikkelende
demokrasie soos Suid-Afrika moet  'n  mens  enige  stap  verwelkom  wat  die
verskeidenheid  van  menings  en  stemme  in  die  media  bevorder.  Dit  is
bevorderlik vir gesonde debat wat die lewe van almal raak, en dit lê ook  'n
goeie grondslag vir onderlinge begrip in 'n samelewing wat  dikwels  nog  in
kompartemente bestaan.

Meer kompetisie beteken ook dat die bestaande  media  gedwing  word  om  nog
beter te funksioneer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J J  DOWRY:  Mr  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  in  a  young,  developing
democracy such as South Africa one should welcome  any  step  promoting  the
diversity of opinions and voices in the media. It is beneficial for  healthy
debate touching the lives of everyone, and it also lays  a  good  foundation
for  mutual  understanding  in  a  society  that  still  often   exists   in
compartments.

More competition also means that the existing media are forced  to  function
even better.]

The Media Development and Diversity Agency Bill marks a  critical  stage  in
the way towards an agency that will help to ensure that  the  constitutional
rights of freedom of expression and information are enjoyed in  practice  by
all South Africans. Broad consensus exists on the need for  such  an  agency
to help redress the legacy of imbalances in access to and  the  use  of  the
media.

I agree with the GCIS that fundamental to the  philosophy  of  the  MDDA  is
that it will not involve itself in content. Rather, it aims to overcome  the
barriers to media development which  have  helped  preserve  the  imbalances
that still exist, like  a  lack  of  access  to  resources.  By  helping  to
overcome such barriers to media development, the  MDDA  should  promote  the
climate conducive to greater media diversity.
Dit  is  steeds  'n  onweerlegbare  feit  dat  mediadiversiteit  tydens  die
afgelope ag jaar nie noemenswaardig gegroei  het  nie.  Die  industrie  moes
baie meer gedoen het om mense uit die agtergeblewe  gemeenskappe  te  betrek
by opleiding, mediageleenthede, en so meer. Baie  meer  mense  uit  voorheen
benadeelde gemeenskappe kon op dié wyse eienaarskap  van  media  bekom  het.
Die industrie het as't ware die Regering gedwing om  met  die  wetgewing  te
kom sodat die wanbalanse aangespreek kon word.

Hoewel die wetgewing in beginsel lofwaardig is, laat dit  ook  terselfdertyd
ernstige vrae ontstaan. Artikel vyf wat gehandel het  oor  die  samestelling
van die beheerraad is gelukkig na debatvoering in  die  portefeulje  komitee
sodanig aangepas dat dit tans baie meer aanvaarbaar is, en dat 'n mens  dalk
daarmee kan saamleef nadat die invloed van GCIS op die samestelling uit  die
weg geruim is. Hoe dit  ookal  sy,  die  politici  kry  magte,  rakende  die
samestelling van die raad, wat geensins bevorderlik is  vir  persvryheid  in
enige demokrasie nie.

Dit het niks te doen met mense se eerlikheid, al dan nie. Dit  is  slegs  'n
geval dat die Parlement, en die  uitvoerende  gesag,  die  pers  onafhanklik
moet hou, en hom moet toelaat om sy eie sake  te  hanteer.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is still an irrefutable fact that the media diversity  during  the  past
eight years has not grown considerably. The industry should have  done  much
more to involve people  from  the  disadvantaged  communities  in  training,
media  opportunities,  and  so  forth.  Many  more  people   from   formerly
disadvantaged communities could have gained ownership of the media  in  this
manner. The industry basically forced the Government to  come  forward  with
the legislation so that the imbalances could be addressed.

Although the Bill is commendable in principle, at the  same  time  it  gives
rise to some serious questions.  Luckily,  after  debate  in  the  portfolio
committee, section five, which dealt with the  composition  of  the  control
board, was  adapted  in  such  a  manner  that  it  is  currently  far  more
acceptable, and that one will possibly be able to live  with  it  after  the
influence of the GCIS on the composition has been removed. In any case,  the
politicians are being  given  powers,  concerning  the  composition  of  the
board, which is in  no  way  conducive  to  freedom  of  the  press  in  any
democracy.

This has nothing to do with people's honesty or dishonesty. It is  merely  a
case of Parliament, and the executive authority, having to  keep  the  press
independent, and allowing it to handle its own affairs.]

According to clause 15 certain media will be helped  financially  by  direct
subsidies, low interest rates, etc. The danger exists that these media  will
lose their independence by their financial dependence on the state and  will
no longer be able to fulfil their watchdog  function  freely.  There  is  no
guarantee that the state will not abuse its power in this  instance.  Direct
subsidies should have been managed by a totally independent body and not  by
the state.

Direct subsidies to small commercial media projects are also  very  welcome.
Direct subsidies, that is, cash grants to small  commercial  media  projects
are part of the enabling environment that the Bill  seeks  to  create.  Such
support is very much in line with the principles  of  economic  empowerment.
In our view the subsidies should be managed by  an  independent  body,  away
from the state, so that press freedom should not in any way be  compromised.
Yes, we remember The Citizen newspaper. Many people  benefited  by  millions
from that project that was supported by the state.  But  the  fact  that  it
happened does not make it right.

Ons moet onthou: ``Wiens brood men eet, diens woord men spreek.''

Lae rente lenings om 'n bedryf aan die gang te kry, is iets  wat  die  staat
reeds doen, en dit kan, soos ons reeds gesê  het,  ook  in  die  mediabedryf
gedoen word, mits dit op 'n streng sakegrondslag gebeur. Selfs al sou  sulke
lenings deur 'n onafhanklike  instansie  toegestaan  word,  sou  uitdruklike
kontraktuele waarborge ook nodig wees om te keer dat die betrokke  media  se
onafhanklikheid, en reg om die staat vrylik te  kritiseer,  aan  bande  gelê
word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We must remember: ``Wiens brood men eet, diens woord men spreek'',  meaning
``Don't bite the hand that feeds you''.

Low-interest loans to get a business started are  already  provided  by  the
state, and this can, as we have said before, also be applied  in  the  media
industry, provided that it takes place  on  a  strict  business  foundation.
Even if such loans were approved by an  independent  organisation,  explicit
contractual guarantees would also be necessary to prevent  the  independence
of the media concerned, and its right to freely criticise  the  state,  from
being curbed.]

In principle a democratic state should do nothing to  even  faintly  suggest
that it wants to restrict press freedom. This means that there should be  no
interference in  an  industry  where  market  forces  define  the  state  of
business. The state should rather engage in talks with  the  media  industry
to express its concerns  about  imbalances  in  the  industry.  They  should
convince the industry to allow more voices on its  own  initiative.  In  the
end every newspaper, magazine and radio station  is  a  commercial  business
which has to stand on its own financial legs.

Newspapers may be more than  just  another  commercial  business,  but  they
still cannot function without money. Just  like  the  state  cannot  support
factories that do not make money, it cannot support media which do not  have
a chance of survival without subsidies.

In die geheel genome moet  daar  simpatie  vir  die  doelstellings  van  die
wetsontwerp wees, veral met die doelstelling om diversiteit  vir  die  media
te vestig deur voorheen benadeelde mense in te bring, en hulle  te  help  om
eienaarskap te kry van 'n  ekonomiese  aktiwiteit  in  ons  gemeenskap  waar
hulle nog nie veel kans gekry het nie.

Die Nuwe NP sal help saamwerk om dit te laat  realiseer,  maar  die  metodes
wat deur die wetsontwerp in die  vooruitsig  gestel  word,  pas  nie  in  'n
liberaal-demokratiese staat nie. Die feit dat die raad slegs regulasies  kan
maak in konsultasie met die Minister, dui daarop dat die raad  nie  absoluut
onafhanklik kan optree nie.

As dit enige ander liggaam in Suid-Afrika was waaroor ons hier gepraat  het,
kon die inmenging deur die staat nog begryp word, maar ons  praat  hier  van
die pers, die media, wat 'n absoluut onafhanklike pilaar van die  demokrasie
is, en wat langs die Parlement  en  die  uitvoerende  gesag  'n  derde  baie
belangrike rol speel. As een van die ander twee pilare begin  voorskriftelik
raak ten opsigte van die  media,  is  ons  besig  om  die  fondasie  van  'n
swaarverdiende demokrasie uit te  kalwe,  en  sal  ons  die  buitewêreld  se
respek verloor.

Om dié rede kan die Nuwe  NP  ongelukkig  nie  die  wetsontwerp  steun  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In all,  there  has  to  be  sympathy  for  the  objectives  of  the  Bill,
especially with the objective of establishing diversity  for  the  media  by
bringing in formerly disadvantaged people, and  assisting  them  in  gaining
ownership of an economic activity in our society  in  which  they  have  not
received many chances.

The New NP will co-operate in helping  to  realise  this,  but  the  methods
envisaged by the Bill have no place in a liberal democratic state. The  fact
that the board can only make regulations in consultation with  the  Minister
shows that the board cannot act absolutely independently.

If it had been any other body in South Africa that we were  discussing,  the
intervention of the state could  have  been  understood,  but  here  we  are
talking about the press, the media,  an  absolutely  independent  pillar  of
democracy which, alongside Parliament and the executive authority,  plays  a
third very important  role.  When  one  of  the  other  two  pillars  starts
becoming prescriptive in respect  of  the  media,  we  are  undermining  the
foundation of a hard-earned democracy, and we will lose the respect  of  the
outside world.

For this reason the New NP unfortunately cannot support the Bill.]

Mrs W S NEWHOUDT-DRUCHEN: Mr Chairperson, hon members,  it  gives  me  great
pleasure to introduce this Media Development and Diversity Agency Bill  that
is in front of us.

Before I mention why this Bill  is  so  important,  let  me  just  say  that
everyone needs information, whether it is  by  word  of  mouth,  reading  or
listening. We all need information. Knowing what is going on  around  us  is
important. On that point, I would like to thank Comrade Chairperson Nat  and
Comrade Randy. They are always willing to keep in touch with me, willing  to
provide me with information via a small device known as  a  cellphone.  How?
Via short message systems. I would like to thank them. [Applause.]

According to our Constitution, we know that  every  South  African  has  the
right to receive information, and  the  right  to  express  and  disseminate
one's opinion within the law. This has not always  been  so.  We  have  just
ended a system of apartheid where public media were turned into  instruments
of National  Party  policy  where  community  media  were  repressed,  where
private media were concentrated in the hands of  a  few,  and  where  a  few
individuals from the white community determined the content of the media.

As a result, the poor and the disadvantaged remain marginalised in terms  of
the media. As Minister Essop Pahad said, and I quote:


  It is common cause that the media in our own country, in its perspective,
  still reflects  a  narrow  range  of  interests  not  reflective  of  our
  country's diversity.

The Bill provides  for  the  establishment  of  the  Media  Development  and
Diversity Agency, which will help create an enabling environment  for  media
development and diversity that is conducive to public  discourse  and  which
reflects the needs and aspirations of all South  Africans.  The  Bill  makes
sure  that  the  communication  environment  improves  so  that   a   better
infrastructure is built and a media that  gives  expression  to  the  voices
currently marginalised will emerge.

The Bill will not interfere with the content  of  any  newspaper,  but  will
make sure that there is an area that will allow  media  to  develop  and  to
meet the diverse needs of  all  South  Africans.  The  Bill  calls  for  the
promotion  of  media  development  and  diversity  by   promoting   support,
primarily  to  community  media  projects.  We  know  that  the  print   and
distribution infrastructures are concentrated  in  the  metropolitan  areas,
and innovative ways to distribute newspapers  to  disadvantaged  communities
in rural and peri-urban areas have yet to emerge. In order to promote  media
diversity,  ownership  and  control  of  the   distribution   and   printing
infrastructures must be addressed.

What do we know about community  newspapers?  I  myself  like  to  read  the
community newspapers, because they are easily understood.  Issues  regarding
my community are raised in these  newspapers.  They  talk  about  issues  of
social concern such as social grants  and  how  to  access  them,  what  the
police are doing in the area, how members of the community can support  each
other, various community activities are mentioned, and all these  activities
are important in our daily lives.

But, we know that, in rural areas, community newspapers are  not  available.
It is in these communities that these community newspapers are  not  written
in the language of the people who live in those communities.  Little  or  no
support is given to these community newspapers.

Newspapers in our own languages will promote literacy, which  we  so  dearly
need in South Africa considering the high level of illiteracy.

According to Statistics South  Africa,  there  are  about  4  million  South
Africans over the age of 15 who are illiterate and  a  further  3,5  million
adults who are functioning illiterate. We need a  culture  of  learning  and
reading, which needs to be encouraged amongst all our people. The  promotion
of literacy and a culture of reading is important both  for  the  individual
and nation-building.

As  mentioned  in  the  position  paper,  the  MDDA  will  liaise  with  the
Department of Education and  other  literacy  organisations  in  considering
support for literacy material production to promote reading.

We need our people to take ownership of community newspapers. I am happy  to
say that this new Bill makes provision for the appointment of a board  which
will support anyone wanting to start their own community newspaper.

Support of ownership will be given to those from historically  disadvantaged
communities. This agency  will  also  encourage  the  development  of  human
resources,  training  and  capacity-building  within  the  media   industry,
especially amongst historically disadvantaged groups, which  include  women,
the youth, children, people  with  disabilities,  the  working  class,  poor
people, people living in rural areas, people living  in  cities  and  towns,
those  having  limited  media  resources,  marginalised   language   groups,
illiterate people and senior citizens.

Yes, as we can see, the Bill is for our people  at  grassroots  level.  This
Bill is basically for us. We congratulate the GCIS for bringing  this  Bill.
Let us continue to work and make  a  better  life  for  our  people  through
making  South  Africa  an  information,   informative,   informed   country.
[Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson,  I  wish  to  congratulate  the  hon  member  Wilma
Newhoudt-Druchen for, in her way, communicating with us and  giving  us  her
innermost feelings on this particular measure.

Worldwide, the media environment is rapidly offering a  greater  variety  of
choice. This is equally true of the media environment in South  Africa.  The
modern  media  environment  offers  more  diversity  and  a  freer  flow  of
information, nationally as well as globally. The other  side  of  the  coin,
however, is that the media can also limit access. South Africa has  its  own
history of a media controlled by particular segments of the population.

Based on Comtask recommendations of  1996,  Cabinet  apparently  decided  to
focus its attention on both media diversity and media development. The  MDDA
will be responsible for developing expertise through  funding  and  research
around media development and diversity, and will  operate  at  arm's  length
from Government, the media industry and donors.

The motivation for the creation of such a body is twofold, as it will  focus
on both diversity and development. Media  diversity,  broadly  speaking,  is
about giving all sectors of  society  affordable  access  to  a  variety  of
opinions and sources of information. These  sectors  range  from  the  aged,
disabled people, people in poorly resourced and remote  areas,  to  working-
class people, women, children and illiterate people.
Ideally, media diversity should reflect the multilingual  and  multicultural
nature of South African society. Within nations, a  combination  of  private
and public initiatives  can  persuade  the  media  to  set  certain  minimum
standards with regard to content and media ownership.

This can be done on a  self-regulating  basis.  A  major  challenge  is  the
transfer of these standards in  an  international  context.  Ultimately,  an
international media system - a so-called global forum -  can  be  developed,
which could offer all individuals and citizens  the  opportunity  of  having
their voices heard.

South Africa is fertile ground for media development. As  a  result  of  the
lack of media diversity in South Africa, the media industry  was  left  with
insufficient  development  in  the  field  of  news  production  and   media
management. Factors  such  as  media  research,  media  financing,  literacy
projects, capacity-building, including journalistic, management,  strategic,
business and financial skills, and networking at regional,  local,  national
and international levels, are the key  focus  areas  of  media  development.
Media development will therefore focus on  matters  such  as  ownership  and
management, access to media, content, news, advertising and ownership.

Factors contributing to the need for an agency  for  media  development  and
diversity are the need for an independent media  development  and  diversity
body  free  from  interference  by  Government;  the  active  promotion   of
democracy and the emphasis being placed on as a wide  a  variety  of  voices
and opinion as possible; the balancing of freedom of expression against  the
right of others, with particular  reference  to  respect  for  standards  of
decency, especially with regard to children, but  avoiding  censorship;  the
accessibility of information,  particularly  in  regions  with  insufficient
human and financial resources;  creating  as  fine  a  balance  as  possible
between the marketplace and the consumer; and enabling governments  to  play
their part in deregulating the media, without exerting undue control.

In conclusion, the drive for the  development  and  diversification  of  the
media in South Africa seems to be in line  with  international  developments
in this field. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Some hon members,  particularly
to my right, are agitating the decibel meter.  If  you  would  just  contain
yourselves, please.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson, the role of the media should effectively  be
about sharing news and views in partnership with society  as  a  whole.  The
creating of information, as well as access to it, is  an  inalienable  right
and  possession  of  the  public  and  the  protection  thereof  should   be
respected.

The  ACDP  respects  the  right  of  the   freedom   of   information   that
intrinsically means the independence of the media in this regard. The  media
should be respected for  the  democratic  role  they  play  within  society.
Therefore our understanding  is  that  like  Government,  the  media  should
equally enjoy space to  develop  according  to  the  needs  and  changes  of
society.

In the apartheid era, the media danced according to the tune of  the  ruling
regime of the time. The media currently seem not to have unlearned this  bad
habit of self-censorship, as they are still biased in giving more  time  and
coverage to bigger parties, thus effectively diminishing their role as  true
democratic institutions of society.

The media are to blame for not  taking  the  initiative  in  broadening  and
diversifying their role in society. Unfortunately, Government  has  to  step
in and promote this process, but fails to do so, and where the  media  could
have controlled this process, Government will  gladly  usurp  centre  stage.
What should have been a natural and  freely  diversified  media  development
process will now be transformed into a controlled process implicated by  the
financial sanction of central Government.

The Bill, as it stands, implies that the agency will determine the  mode  of
operation of media development and diversification based  upon  the  support
of the Minister, and he will enjoy authority over this process. The ACDP  is
concerned about the powers and influence that the Minister  will  have.  The
ACDP is all in favour of the development and diversification of  the  media,
especially if the party will enjoy greater  respect  for  its  own  role  in
Parliament. Yet the issue at stake is not how we can  benefit,  but  whether
the media will be free of Government interference. I trust that this is  not
another Zimbabwe in the making.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairman, the PAC  supports  the  Media  Development  and
Diversity  Agency  Bill.  [Applause.]  Our  country  needs  development  and
diversity in the media. This is one of the main ways of  promoting  national
stability and enriching democracy in our country.

The media in this country desperately need a process of  decolonisation  and
abandonment of behaving as if the eurocentric view of the world is the  only
one in the world.
African countries have made a blunder of the first magnitude by allowing  so
much foreign or European investment in media to control  the  minds  of  our
people to their advantage. Diversity cannot come out  of  media  which  were
founded on colonialism and racism, and  whose  objectives  were  to  protect
foreign interests and trample down those of the indigenous people.

The purpose of the  Media  Development  and  Diversity  Agency  Bill  is  to
provide for the support of projects aimed  at  promoting  media  development
and diversity.

The PAC goes along with clause 6 regarding  qualifications  of  persons  who
may not be appointed on the board  of  the  agency.  Clause  17  deals  with
special groups who must benefit.  Some  of  them  are  poor  people,  people
living in rural  areas,  women,  the  youth,  children,  illiterate  people,
senior citizens and people with disabilities. The present media  pay  little
or no attention to these special groups.

However, we find that clause 18(3) contradicts clauses 6(c) and  (d),  which
say respectively that a person may not be an MP or the office  bearer  of  a
political party. Yet clause 18(3) provides for the Minister to  provide  for
detailed criteria for selecting, albeit  in  consultation  with  the  board.
[Applause.]

Ms M R MORUTOA:  Mr  Chairperson,  members  of  the  Cabinet,  hon  members,
members of the public, firstly, I would like to correct a statement from  my
colleagues from the portfolio committee from the opposition  party.  Nowhere
in the Bill does it state that the Government Communication and  Information
System will be represented on the board.  Hon  members  Vos  and  Smuts  are
misleading the House.

My speech will  be  on  the  outstanding  importance  of  having  the  Media
Development and Diversity Agency  Bill  enacted.  The  ANC  gives  its  full
support to this Bill because the historic aim of the  ANC  is  to  lead  the
democratic and patriotic forces to destroy the apartheid legacy and  replace
it with a united, nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South Africa in  which
people as a whole shall govern and all shall enjoy equal rights.
The time has come!  And  the  time  is  now!  The  MDDA  is  an  independent
statutory body without regulatory powers. Its aim will be to obliterate  the
barriers that exist in achieving the  Government's  objective  of  universal
access to diverse information in the society. For  instance,  commuters  are
interested in receiving information on programmes  addressing  their  social
needs in their indigenous languages. The only way to address the  plight  of
these communities is by licensing more community radio  stations.  Community
radio stations represent  the  democratisation  of  communications  and  the
adaptation of the media for the use of  communities.  They  aim  to  be  the
basis of popular participation by communities.

It has been seven years  since  the  first  community  radio  licences  were
issued, and community radio has had a profound  impact  on  opening  up  the
airwaves in South Africa.

The latest radio audience measurement, or  Rams,  figures  estimate  overall
weekly listenership at well over three  million.  In  the  past  five  years
alone 100 community radio stations have been licensed and 80  of  these  are
still going strong.

The radio stations became a breeding ground for big-timers like  the  famous
Phat Joes of this world who happened to be  volunteers  at  community  radio
stations before they became famous. The community radio that I  am  speaking
about should be a different one from the cheap radio stations  that  we  had
previously. It should address issues of women and give  information  to  the
elderly  about  their  social  grants.  It  should   broadcast   educational
programmes for the youth. The MDDA should work with Icasa for the  licensing
and co-ordination of community radio stations.

On the other hand, it would be ideal for the  universal  service  agency  to
roll out telecentres where community radio stations  could  be  established.
Gone are the days of the colonialist order.  I  would  like  to  remind  the
House of the broadcasting stations we had in the 1950s.  In  Soweto  we  had
Radio Fusion. I do not know how many hon members still remember  what  Radio
Fusion was. Umsakazo. [Radio.] A box was installed in a house,  without  any
consultation with the occupants of the premises. It did  not  give  one  any
option but  to  listen  to  the  programmes  prepared  by  the  broadcasting
authorities. It was also used for propaganda purposes. The  first  programme
on Radio Fusion would start at five. I have already mentioned that  one  had
no option, because there were no utilities to operate  on  this  device.  In
the morning one was compelled to  listen  to  this  loud  sound  of  a  cock
crowning: ``Cookerookookoo.'' [Laughter.]

Vukani, vukani, sekusile madoda. [Kuyahlekwa.] [Wake  up,  wake  up,  it  is
already daylight. [Laughter.]]

This meant everyone should wake up and start running  for  their  trains  or
buses to go and toil for their living,  while  the  society  of  whites  was
enjoying the preferred radio stations such as Springbok  Radio,  the  medium
waves and LM Radio. [Interjections.] These stations were using  English  and
Afrikaans, and were very biased towards the white communities.

The poor black people never even thought of having  a  sophisticated  device
such as a radio.

Sekela Sihlalo,  ndichaza  indlela  le  zixabiseke  ngayo  iindawo  zosasazo
eluntwini,  ngoba  nabantu   abadala   baye   bakwazi   ukumamela   iinkqubo
zenkamnkam,  nolutsha  luyakwazi  ukuva  ngamathuba   emisebenzi   kwiindawo
ngeendawo nakwiidolophu ezinkulu.  Enye  into  ebalulekileyo  ngala  majelo,
ziimfundiso ezikhoyo ngesifo ugawulayo. Le ke yinto ebaluleke  kakhulu  kula
maxesha angoku. Ndiyathemba okokuba le  ntetho  iya  kufikelela  ezindlebeni
ezibukhali  zabemi  boMzantsi  Afrika.  (Translation  of   Xhosa   paragraph
follows.)

[Deputy Chairperson, I am trying to explain the importance of the  media  to
people because even old people can listen over the radio to programmes  that
talk  about  pension  issues,  the  youth  are  able  to  hear   about   job
opportunities in different places and big towns and  cities.  Another  thing
that is important  about  the  media  is  that  people  get  educated  about
HIV/Aids. That is very important nowadays. I hope that all the  citizens  of
South Africa will hear this speech.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think the hon member could  well  be
called upon to start the next Comrades Marathon. [Laughter.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the media is one of the  world's  key  factors
in communication. The message that it conveys, portrays and  establishes  is
crucial. This could be both positive and negative but, as  a  Government  of
transparency, we think that it is crucial  that  all  activities  should  be
accessible to the public, whether positive or negative.

We have passed the era of shoving things under the  carpet  and  hiding  the
truth. It is mainly for this reason that today  many  people  still  falsely
believe that the era  of  apartheid  was  an  era  of  good  governance  and
management of South African affairs, as they  were  unaware  of  the  racial
discrimination. People were  misled  to  believe  that  lie  and  are  today
puzzled by our Government's performance  regarding  transformation  and  the
lack of funds. Others claim that it engages in unnecessary  expenditure  but
they do not realise that we are sitting with a massive  foreign  debt  which
was accumulated by the past  regime.  Hard  work,  sacrifice  and  time  are
needed to overcome it. If the foreign debt was written off, our  performance
and achievements would be much greater.

However, I am here to rather talk about the Media Development and  Diversity
Agency Bill that the MF  supports.  Having  noted  the  various  organs  and
parties that were consulted, it would be  expected  that  the  agency  would
serve as a credit. As part of the Government of transparency, the  MF  hopes
that this agency will also undertake to ensure the success and  achievements
of the Government's projects for the people  so  that  the  true  notion  of
delivery should be conveyed, and hope and confidence  be  instilled  in  our
people and the Government of our people.

The  MF  supports  the  Media  Development  and   Diversity   Agency   Bill.
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, wanneer ons praat  van  verskeidenheid  en
ontwikkeling, rakende dit wat  hierdie  Raad  gaan  doen,  dan  is  die  AEB
positief. Die grond van ons bestaan is dat verskeidenheid erken  moet  word.
Ons glo ook  dat  ontwikkeling  op  alle  gebiede  die  sleutel  is  tot  'n
suksesvolle Suid-Afrika, dat die media  in  Suid-Afrika  die  verskeidenheid
van alle  gemeenskappe  moet  reflekteer,  en  dat  alle  gemeenskappe  moet
ontwikkel. Die staat moet hiertoe bydra, finansieel ook, want  die  vryemark
kan wreed wees. Dit kan die vet koeie vetter maak en monopolieë  tot  gevolg
hê.

Maar wanneer die regerende party, via sy Minister  van  propaganda,  indirek
'n keuse kan uitoefen oor wie gefinansier word, en wie nie, begin  die  rooi
ligte flikker. Die gevaar bestaan dan dat  die  verskeidenheid  kan  sneuwel
ter wille van ``his master's one voice''. Ons het vandag mooi  beloftes  oor
onafhanklikheid gehoor. Waarom dan die groot regeringsinspraak?

As 'n mens onafhanklikheid soek, implementeer  jy  onafhanklikheid.  Jy  kan
nie vir wolf skaapwagter maak, net omdat hy so mooi belowe hy gaan  nie  die
skape eet nie. Hy gaan. [Gelag.] Dit is in sy aard. Hy is 'n  politikus  wat
stemme soek by 'n volgende stembus. Hy kom  boonop  van  'n  party  met  die
hoofdoelwit:  ``To  change  the  minds  and  the  hearts  of  the  people.''
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Ten spyte van al die mooi ideale mag politici nie  op  hierdie  wyse  beheer
kry oor die media nie. Wat is die alternatief? 'n Onafhanklike  liggaam  wat
soos die OVK  met  vaste  kriteria  en  vaste  formules  verskeidenheid  kan
bevorder.  Ons  het  hier  te  doen  met  'n  proses   van,   nie   ``social
engineering'' nie, maar ``media engineering''. Dit is 'n goeie diagnose  wat
gemaak is, naamlik dat daar 'n behoefte ontstaan het; ongelukkig is  hierdie
wetsontwerp dodelike medisyne.

Die AEB kan nie hierdie wetsontwerp steun nie. [Applous.]  [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, when we speak of  diversity  and  development,
regarding what this House is going to do, then  the  AEB  is  positive.  The
foundation of our existence is that diversity has  to  be  acknowledged.  We
also believe that development in all spheres is  the  key  to  a  successful
South Africa, that the media in South Africa should  reflect  the  diversity
of all communities, and that all communities must develop.  The  state  must
contribute to this, also financially, because the free market can be  cruel.
It can fatten up the fat cows and cause monopolies.

But  when  the  governing  party,  via  its  Minister  of  propaganda,   can
indirectly exercise a  choice  regarding  who  will  and  who  will  not  be
financed, the red lights start  flickering.  The  danger  then  exists  that
diversity can be slain for the sake of ``his master's one voice''. Today  we
heard lovely promises regarding independence.  Why,  then,  does  Government
have such a great say in the matter?

When one seeks independence, one implements  independence.  You  cannot  let
the wolf take care of the sheep just because he dutifully  promises  not  to
eat the sheep. He will. [Laughter.] It is in his nature. He is a  politician
seeking votes at the next poll. In addition he  comes  from  a  party  whose
main  aim  is  to  change  the  minds  and  the  hearts   of   the   people.
[Interjections.]

In spite of all the fine-sounding ideals, politicians may not  gain  control
of the media in this manner. What is the alternative?  An  independent  body
which, like the IEC, can promote diversity with set criteria  and  formulas.
Here we are dealing with a process, not of social engineering, but of  media
engineering.  A  good  diagnosis  was  made,  namely  that  a  need  exists;
unfortunately this Bill is deadly medicine.

The AEB cannot support this Bill. [Applause.] [Interjections.]]
The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, I would like, first of all,  to
thank all of the speakers who participated in this debate for  their  input,
and I include Ms Dene Smuts. However, I do regret one  thing:  The  approach
taken by Ms Dene Smuts reminds me that we actually do live in two worlds.

There is a world inhabited by the DP, which is very  different  to  the  one
inhabited by the hon members Phadagi and Morutoa, for example, and it  would
have helped the hon members from the other world to  sometimes  just  pay  a
little attention to what the hon Phadagi and Murotoa said, for example.  Now
I am not sure that Ms Smuts's choice,  as  a  journalistic  device,  to  use
Thatcherism-Stalinism is going to endear  her  to  those  very  conservative
friends and supporters that she has. They are not going  to  be  happy  with
her. She probably lost her party some votes. If I were the Whip Mr Ellis,  I
would  have  another  look  at  her  speeches   before   she   makes   them.
[Interjections.]

If that hon member had some thoughts to control he could control  them,  but
some of those members do not have any thoughts, so it is a bit difficult  to
control them.

I do understand that Ms Southgate's party  has  very  few  members  in  this
House and therefore it is not possible for the ACDP to  attend  all  of  the
meetings of the portfolio committees, but it would have helped  if  she  had
just taken the trouble to actually read Bill. I take it that  she  can  read
English. It would have taken her no more than  half  an  hour  to  read  the
Bill. If she had read the Bill, Ms Southgate would not have  said  what  she
said.

There is nothing in this piece  of  legislation  about  government  control,
nothing whatsoever. What it does say is that, with  respect  to  regulations
that would govern even the way the  board  may  function,  the  Minister  in
consultation with the board, as Comrade Kekana pointed out, will make  these
regulations. With any government in any part of the  world,  the  making  of
regulations is essentially the function of the executive. What we have  done
in this Bill is bend over backwards to  accommodate  those  in  the  private
sector who are making a contribution and who said that they did not  want  a
situation in which regulations were passed which would make them unhappy.

Let me repeat this so that the hon member does not have to  read  the  Bill.
The Minister cannot make regulations on  his  own.  They  will  be  made  in
consultation with the board and the board itself cannot publish  regulations
in the Gazette ... [Interjections.] The hon member should  read  page  8  at
the bottom there, and if she still does  not  understand  she  can  meet  me
outside and I will explain it.

Secondly, I would be ashamed if I were one of  those  hon  members,  really,
because I am  utterly  disgusted  at  someone  who  could  stand  here,  not
understanding a piece of legislation, and then express the hope  that  there
will not be a Zimbabwe. What is the matter with them?  Politically,  I  call
on them not to join the serried ranks of the reactionaries. If they want  to
win one more  seat  in  2004,  they  should  not  go  in  the  direction  of
reactionary politics, because then they will  lose  even  those  seats  that
they have now. [Applause.]

Let me say this to Ms Smuts. If we had wished to do so, as the Government  -
we are putting more money into this than the private sector - we could  have
done so without the necessity of having any piece of legislation.  We  could
have set up a media development and diversity agency. What we have done,  in
spite of the fact that we are putting in more money, is  actually  introduce
a piece of legislation which, as Ms Vos asked, will then put this agency  at
arm's length from the Government. We have done this in  spite  of  the  fact
that we are putting the bulk of the money into the agency.  There  are  very
few governments in this world that are prepared to do that.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Would  the  Minister  please  start
rounding off?

The MINISTER: We are prepared to do that because we believe  very  sincerely
that what we require in South Africa is a diversified media  that  will  act
and  operate  in  a  way  in  which  those  of  our  people  who  have  been
systematically denied the right not only to receive information but also  to
impart it will now begin to get that right. That is why we  are  setting  up
this agency.

So it is the opposite of any attempt to control  anything.  Therefore,  even
at this late stage - I have known Ms Smuts for a long  time,  we  negotiated
together at Kempton Park, and I know that she  is  a  nice  person,  she  is
bright, and that she understands many things - I would  like  to  appeal  to
her to support this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time  (Democratic  Party,  New  National  Party,  African
Christian Democratic Party and Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging dissenting).

The House adjourned at 18:56.
