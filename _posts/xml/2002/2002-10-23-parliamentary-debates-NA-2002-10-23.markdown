[Mr I Z NCINANE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that this month, which has been dedicated to the protection of
       children's rights, a young girl of 17, Philani Xintolo, is doing
       voluntary work with homeless children in Umtata;


  (2) believes that the voluntary work done by this young girl is in
       response to the ANC's call to all the people of South Africa to
       become volunteers for change in this country;


  (3) commends Philani Xintolo for doing voluntary work, particularly among
       homeless children; and


  (4) calls upon all the citizens of South Africa, young and old, to follow
       this very good example and lend a hand in the creation of a better
       life for all the people of this country.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That this House -


  (1) notes that the crossing-over period for local government councillors
       ended last night;


  (2) notes further that the ANC/New NP alliance enticed a few hundred
       councillors into their ranks;


  (3) thanks the ANC for disposing of the New NP as a political competitor;
       and


  (4) acclaims the fact that the political discourse and competition in
       South Africa between now and 2004 will be between the ANC and the DA.



[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock that some doctors in Cape Town are practising in
       fear of their lives while others are being forced to close their
       surgeries as a result of a spate of attacks and armed robberies;


  (2) further notes that some of the doctors alleged that the police had
       failed to respond at the time of the crimes and took three weeks to
       arrive and to take down full statements;


  (3) realises that we cannot afford to have surgeries closing down and
       doctors leaving, especially in the poor areas; and


  (4) calls upon the relevant authorities to urgently address these and
       other crimes against surgeries and hospitals around South Africa.

[Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the month of October is for the rights of the children and
       that His Majesty Chief M P K Tshivhase awarded the merit certificates
       to -


       (a)  matric learners who obtained the highest marks at Shayandima
           Secondary School;


       (b)  three teachers who excelled in teaching; and


       (c)  about 10 school principals who were given laptop computers;
  (2) believes that these awards encourage the culture of learning,
       teaching and being responsible to the community and that education is
       an important tool to encourage children to know their rights as
       citizens and leaders of tomorrow; and


  (3) would like to thank his Majesty Chief M P K Tshivhase in this
       education and encouragement to the learners, teachers, school
       principals and the royal clan of the Tshivhase family.]

Mnr A BLAAS: Mevrou die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis, namens die Nuwe NP:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  Denel 'n multi-miljoenrand- buitelandse kontrak met die Finse
           vloot gesluit het, deur plaaslik vervaardigde Umkhonto-oppervlak-
           tot-lug-missiele aan hulle te verskaf; en


       (b)  dit die eerste buitelandse kontrak vir Umkhonto-missiele is en
           dat die missiele uniek is deurdat hulle vertikaal gelanseer kan
           word, 'n intelligente vermoë het om tussen 'n verskeidenheid
           teikens te kan onderskei en, verder ook aantreklik gemaak word
           deur die mededingende prys waarteen dit gelewer kan word;


  (2) verder kennis neem dat -


       (a)  Finland 'n lid van die Europese Unie is en dit in Suid-Afrika se
           guns tel, aangesien dit vertroue in die Suid-Afrikaanse
           wapenvervaardigingsbedryf by ander lidlande van die EU kan
           inboesem; en


         b) die Nuwe NP Denel gelukwens met hierdie groot kontrak en die
            hoop uitspreek dat dit een van vele sal wees wat daartoe sal
            bydra dat ons inheemse wapenvervaardigingsbedryf sy regmatige
            erkenning in die internasionale wapenbedryf sal kry.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Denel concluded a multi-million rand offshore contract with the
           Finnish navy, by supplying them with locally produced Umkhonto
           surface-to-air missiles; and


       (b)  this is the first offshore contract for Umkhonto missiles and
           that these missiles are unique in that they can be launched
           vertically and have an intelligent ability to distinguish
           between a variety of targets and is further also made more
           attractive by the competitive price at which it can be supplied;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  Finland is a member of the European Union and this is in South
           Africa's favour, as it can instil confidence in the South
           African armaments manufacturing industry with other members of
           the EU; and


       (b)  the New NP congratulates Denel on this large contract and
           expresses the hope that this would be one of many which would
           contribute to our local armaments industry getting its deserved
           recognition in the international arms industry.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I will move on behalf the UDM at the next
sitting of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) affirms that access to proper and adequate public health care is a
       primary function of Government, which is a constitutional right of
       every citizen that Government must progressively realise;


  (2) acknowledges that health care issues, ranging from nutrition to
       reproductive care, to HIV/Aids and other communicable diseases have a
       major impact on millions of South Africans and, if considered in
       total, point to a massive social injustice that continues to occur
       eight years into the democratic dispensation;


  (3) therefore expresses its disgust with figures for January this year
       that were released yesterday and which indicate that there were 29
       208 vacant posts at public health institutions, which has been
       attributed to the brain drain as well as inadequate budgets at
       provincial health departmental level; and


  (4) calls upon the Minister of Health to develop strategies to prevent
       the medical brain drain as well as to ensure that provincial health
       departments receive adequate funding in the next budget to appoint
       health care professionals to address this unnecessary and highly
       irresponsible backlog.

(Translation of Sotho notice of motion follows.)

[Mr S PHOHLELA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Social Development, Honourable Zola
       Skweyiya, will hold a two-day summit with representatives from all
       tiers of government, business leaders, NGOs, faith-based
       organisations and international donors;


  (2) further notes that the theme of the planned conference is ``Poverty
       Alleviation and Eradication - for Integrated Business and Government
       Approach'' and will focus on the creation of partnerships for poverty
       alleviation, the fight against HIV/Aids, children's access to social
       grants and the rights of the elderly and disabled;


  (3) believes that this summit will contribute to the ongoing national
       dialogue to develop strategies to meet the socio-economic challenges
       of the poor and in a fight against poverty; and


  (4) commends Minister Skweyiya for embarking on this important
       initiative.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  there is a threat of war against Iraq by the governments of
           America and of Britain; and


       (b)  both governments are endangering world peace by their intended
           aggression in Iraq;


  (2) observes that to eradicate poverty and accelerate economic
       development, especially in the former colonised countries of Africa
       and other, there must be peace in the world so that all available
       resources may be used for sustainable development envisaged by the
       recent World Summit for Sustainable Development;


  (3) cautions that if the American and British governments want action to
       be taken against Iraq, it must be authorised by the Security Council
       according to the United Nations Charter;


  (4) believes that America and Britain as permanent members of the
       Security Council must observe the UN Charter and international law in
       general; and


  (5) salutes the People's Republic of China, France and Russia, which are
       three of the five permanent members of the Security Council, for
       abiding by the UN Charter and condemns America and Britain for their
       intention to commit aggression against Iraq, whose main objective is
       to protect their oil interests in the Middle East.

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, at the next sitting of the House, I will move
on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the landmark judgment handed down by Acting High Court Judge
       Hilton Epstein last week when he dismissed Filmmaker De Reuck's claim
       that he had a constitutional right to possess child pornography;


  (2) notes that the judge stated that the Constitution was not ``a licence
       to deprave, nor is it designed to promote shameful or wicked
       behaviour'', and that child pornography ``is debased, dehumanises and
       has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and that it presents one of the
       most, if not the most, serious problems threatening the fabric of
       South African society,'';


  (3) further notes that the evidence presented by the state advocates
       indicated that the psychological effects on children involved in
       child pornography included feelings of guilt, worthlessness and rage,
       which could lead to long-term problematic social and sexual
       functioning; and


  (4) consequently calls upon Government to use every means at its disposal
       to eradicate this growing multi-million Rand business, which is a
       scourge of our society.

[Applause.]

Mr L V NGCULU: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the United States National Institute for Health awarded
       the Universities of Stellenbosch, Witwatersrand and Cape Town a grant
       to the tune of R220 million;


  (2) further notes that this money will be used for research projects
       which will focus on testing whether the interruption of treatment is
       an affordable way of controlling the HIV infection, determining the
       efficacy of two child vaccines and developing simple and inexpensive
       methods of diagnosing HIV and monitoring treatment;


  (3) believes that the outcome of this research project will contribute
       positively to improving existing intervention strategies to curb the
       spread of HIV/Aids; and
  (4) welcomes the R220 million grant to fight the scourge of HIV/Aids.

[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That this House -


  (1) notes that –


       (a)  the final report of the UN Panel on the Illegal Exploitation of
           Natural Resources and other Forms of Wealth of the DRC found
           that ruling elites of the governments of the DRC, Rwanda, Uganda
           and Zimbabwe are involved with global criminal networks in the
           exploitation of natural and fiscal resources; and


       (b)  the Zimbabwe Defence Minister proposed to President Mugabe that
           a company be set up in Mauritius to disguise the continuing
           economic interests of the Zimbabwe Defence Force and elite in
           the DRC; and


  (2) calls on President Mbeki to give assurances that -


       (a)  silent diplomacy is confronting Zimbabwe's new resource
           colonialism in the DRC;


       (b)  South Africa is not a transit country for or recipient of
           conflict commodities from the DRC; and


       (c)  any South Africans implicated in the report are under
           investigation for possible prosecution.

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) learns with extreme horror that an eight-year-old school girl in
       Gauteng was raped in class by a fellow pupil in the presence of other
       pupils;


  (2) recognises that this problem is one that has to be rooted out; and


  (3) calls on the Ministers of Education and of Safety and Security
       immediately to set up a high-level investigation and to report fully
       to the House.

Mr L ZITA: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Industrial Development Corporation, IDC, has announced that
           it is entering into a R230 million empowerment deal with Black
           Management Forum Investment Firm and Karsten Boerdery in the
           agricultural sector for the development of Koebos Fruit Farms in
           Northern Cape, which will export grapes; and


       (b)  this project is estimated to bring approximately R166 million in
           foreign currency and to lead to the creation of 1 250 jobs;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the implementation of this empowerment deal will contribute
           positively in the transformation of the agricultural sector to
           allow for the participation of historically disadvantaged
           communities as farmers; and


       (b)  the new job opportunities which will be created by this project
           will contribute positively to the fight against poverty; and


  (3) welcomes this empowerment deal, among IDC, Karsten Boerdery and Black
       Management Forum Investment Firm to develop Koebos Fruit Farms.

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting
of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the confession by Mr Andile Ngcaba, the DG of the
       Department of Communications, that the SABC has no funds to create
       the regional broadcasting service to promote multilingualism; and


  (2) calls on the Government to recognise the historical, diminished use
       and status of our people's indigenous languages, and to implement
       practical and positive measures to elevate the status of and advance
       the use of indigenous languages, including Afrikaans.
[Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -

           toilet in the Old Assembly section of Parliament;


       (b)  the fire was detected by Lulamile Klassen, a Parliamentary
           switchboard operator;


       (c)  the cause of the fire is attributed to an electrical
           malfunction; and


       (d)  that neither smoke detectors nor the fire alarm was activated;
           and


  (2) commends maintenance assistant, Shaun Brown, Lulamile Klassen and
       service officer Gavin Solomons for their brave and heroic actions in
       extinguishing the fire with gas fire extinguishers and in so doing
       averting a potential disaster in our Parliament.

                                FINANCE BILL

                         BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Speaker, hon members of this House,
the Bill that we present here today is debated in the wake of the
celebration of Press Freedom Day in our country on 19 October. This 25th
commemoration of a very dark day in our country, when a number of black
news organisations were closed down and their members arrested because the
apartheid government did not like their views, is a stark reminder of what
we as a Government should never repeat, and what we as South Africans
should never again accept.

Perhaps it is opportune that this Bill is debated at a time when we are
reflecting on where we come from and contemplating the future of our young
democracy. The debate on this Bill and the commemoration help us to
reaffirm that media is fundamental to democracy and that a free media is
imperative.

The Bill we are presenting was first received with some hysteria and
unfounded or misguided accusations of Government's intentions to control
the media, particularly the public broadcaster, and ride roughshod over the
Constitution and the rights it confers on those in the media. Nothing could
be further from the truth.

We introduced the Bill very conscious of the fact that it would spark
debate about broadcasting's role and social obligations, a debate we had
tried unsuccessfully to engage in with the SABC for two years. Our
experience from the complaints that we had received from a number of
members of this House and members of the public, both urban and rural -
both those who are highly literate, with access to numerous media, and
those who are illiterate, with limited access to the media except radio -
helped to shape this Bill.

We were painfully aware of how the media, and the SABC in particular, had a
so-called expert - I hope members still remember him - by the name of
Eugene Nyathi. In fact, I was painfully reminded that the SABC is the one
that created Nyathi during my chairpersonship of that organisation.

More recently two other issues of how broadcasters can unleash havoc on the
public were brought to my attention. A radio in a province I shall not name
had a weekly programme in which an expert on witchcraft was presented to
the public, only to be told by the so-called expert psychiatrist that he is
actually a mental patient. I asked myself: Why and how can we unleash such
insanity - excuse the pun - on our unsuspecting public.

In another province, a weekly programme had an internecine war fanned
between two people, one a mayor of a town and the other a radio programme
presenter. The unsuspecting public were not informed that the presenter was
in fact the former mayor of that town who was unhappy about having been
ousted. Such abuse of our airwaves was certainly not intended by the right
of freedom of expression.

What appeared as an extreme position of Government in the Bill was intended
to have all South Africans - and, indeed, this Parliament - focus their
attention on the challenge of accountability and responsibility in
broadcasting, cognisant of the diversity of experiences of all the people
of this nation.

After the initial reaction of this nation and the portfolio committee
through the newspapers, radio programmes and the debates of hon members of
this House, we are able to focus on the real issues, rather than the
imagined ones that arose out of either a lack of reading and/or the failure
to understand the Bill.

The debates allowed us to deal with challenges confronting South Africa,
such as unequal access to television broadcasting in languages of the
majority; lack of sufficient local content in programming that reflects
South Africa and a shared vision of a diverse population; balancing the
right of freedom of expression with the other rights enshrined in the Bill
of rights in the Constitution; and challenges that are reflected in what
Joe Thloloe, a respected journalist, called ``the deteriorating standards
in the news room''. He asks us to accept these fact, because a large core
of experienced journalists have been lost to the trade.

He wrote as follows in the Sowetan: ``With the influx of junior reporters,
the craft has lost its stature''. In this vein another journalist wrote
that journalists must use analytical tools to verify information and get
their stories from primary sources, rather than replacing these with
telephone and fax journalism. And he complaints that there is no
verification.

It was those kinds of things that influenced us in the manner in which we
first drafted the Bill. It was also challenges such as the lack of news,
editorials, programming, language and other policies that informed or
shaped the content of the national broadcaster, or else the lack of
knowledge on the part of the public regarding any existing policies. It was
challenges of the incomplete or what I called unfinished debate and the
poorly articulated discourse on national interests, as well as the
challenge of funding the public broadcaster without compromising its
independence.

We are happy now that finally common sense and reason have prevailed over
posturing, political rhetoric, sound bites and other opportunistic
machinations, thereby allowing us to reach consensus on a wide range of
issues pivotal to the development of the broadcasting system. As the debate
of this Bill proceeded, it became clear that the discussions became less
political and more about what is good for this new democracy in the context
of a society that has not yet achieved what is called national consensus.
There developed a cohesion and a respect for different views and I wish to
thank all involved for this co-operation.

This Bill brings greater clarity by categorising different licences in
accordance with services provided. We wish to thank all those that made
technical inputs, such as Multichoice, M-Net, Orbicom, Sentech and Telkom,
for their valuable inputs in this regard.

The Bill also provides for the implementation of the conversion and
corporatisation of the SABC. It includes a charter, as well as
accountability and compliance mechanisms. It strengthens the role of the
publicly selected board in terms of governance and of Icasa in terms of
regulation, licensing and monitoring.

To ensure delivery by the public broadcaster on its mandate, it is now
required in law that it prepares and submits to the regulator policies that
will ensure compliance with the regulator's code of conduct and its licence
conditions, as well as the objectives contained in the Broadcasting Act.

The board must ensure public participation in the development of policies
and institute regular and effective means to solicit public opinion about
its programming and give due consideration to that public input. The SABC
must also develop its own code of conduct to ensure that the corporation
complies with the constitutional principle of equality and equitable
treatment of all people, all languages and the rights of all to
information. The SABC must strive to provide a wide range of audience
interests, beliefs and expressions, and a high standard of accuracy,
fairness and impartiality must be adhered to.

The Bill now vests regional services with the SABC as entities under the
full control of the SABC Board. These additional television services that
will broadcast regionally in languages appropriated to the regions achieve
one of the founding principles of the Constitution. This not only gives
greater coverage to indigenous languages, but also recognises the cultural
diversity and needs of our people, and enriches our society. It also states
that original services should receive grants from the state and that
revenue can also be drawn from sponsorships, donations and other grants.

Concern has been expressed about the potential dilution of the regulator,
who is constitutionally empowered to issue broadcasting licences. However,
there is legal precedent for the legislature to give direction to the
regulator to begin a licensing process over which it would then have sole
control.

For example, Parliament mandated the IBA to license a third television
channel after the triple-enquiry process. No regulator can operate without
direction and it is not unusual internationally for either parliament or
government also to give guidance or to defend the interests of the public.
Of particular importance is that, for the first time, the SABC is required
by law to develop these policies in areas of its operation, such as
editorial, content programming, local content, education, etc.

The provision that SABC must enjoy freedom of expression, as well as
journalistic, creative and programming independence is retained, but this
right is correctly placed in the context of and is to be balanced with
other rights of all citizens. This freedom of expression is integral to the
freedom of our people and, as our President said during his Freedom Day
address this year, and I quote:


  Freedom will have meaning if we work not only for individual fulfilment,
  but also for the good of every South African, men, women and children,
  and in so doing recognise that the freedom of each and every one of us is
  necessarily connected to the freedom of all.

The charter now states that the programming of the SABC must reflect South
African values and attitudes, display South African talent and offer a
variety of South African views, as well as advance the national and public
interests. And therefore the public broadcaster must encourage the
development of South African expression by providing a wide range of
programming in all official languages.

We have listened to a number of imputs that suggest that we should have a
separate Bill for the SABC and we will give serious consideration to this.
The procedures for granting additional pay-television licences are catered
for, thus allowing for competition in this sector.

In conclusion, I must emphasise that this Bill is about real issues, real
people and their real needs. We have sought to ensure that the broadcasting
system as a whole contributes to making a difference in peoples' lives by
allowing for the reflection of their reality and the enhancement of their
empowerment, so that we or they can participate in ... sociopolitical
discussions in order to shape the future of this country and its people.

The space we have carved for meaningful participation by the public must be
used to advance the national interests of building a united, democratic and
caring South Africa. As individuals and collectives, we must take
responsibility to make our input in the shaping of policies that will
define the South African expression. As we have always said, rights go hand
in hand with responsibilities, therefore we must always remember to
participate in policy formulation and the implementation of the law. So let
us all pay our television licences: it is the right thing to do.

Finally, we wish to thank all the organisations and people who made
valuable contributions throughout the processing of this Bill. We know we
have a better Bill that satisfies the majority of the concerns that were
raised.

I would like to thank all the members of the Portfolio Committee on
Communication, especially the chairperson, for steering through a Bill that
ensures broadcasting which reflects the diversity of our people, their
cultures, traditions and aspirations.

I also want to thank all the individuals and organisations that
participated in the public processes and hearings, thereby enriching the
discussions and strengthening our democracy. Special thanks go to the
Department of Communications, in particular to the director-general and the
deputy director-general, for co-ordinating the process that culminated in
the presentation of this Bill to Parliament.

I request that this House accept this Bill. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, the new Government tactic to achieve old goals
seems to be to table, leak or otherwise introduce shock measures which
reverse the negotiated new order and then, having created a panic, to
retreat in a show of sweet reason to a compromise position. That
compromised position becomes the new norm or point of departure. Little by
little, the original principle is eroded. Step by step, the original goal
is advanced.

It has taken weeks of work by many people just to return broadcasting to
the status quo ante minus.

Partye wat deel wil vorm van die proses van regering, is vol verligting.
``Sien,'' sê die Nuwe NP, ``die ANC is nie magshonger nie!'' Ryke ironie,
komende van waar die Nuwe NP sit. [Parties who want to form part of
government are quite relieved. ``You see'', says the New NP, ``the ANC is
not power-hungry!'' Such irony, if one considers where the New NP is
sitting.]

``They never meant it'', is what the New NP is saying. The SACP and Cosatu
know better. I am prepared to accept that the hon the Minister did not
intend to act inappropriately, but she is very badly advised, as they say.
The trouble, in our view, comes from much higher up, as a glance at
Umrabulo's media policy, preceding the ANC conference and endorsed from
high up, makes abundantly clear.

Hon members must not expect the DP to vote for this Bill just because we
helped to legislate the unconstitutionality out of it. That is what
Parliament is supposed to do, and it is high time, in fact, that this
committee redeemed itself. I do not see any reason why we should be so
thrilled that we managed to defeat overtly unconstitutional measures like
ministerial control of SABC policies, that we should then vote for the
substitute, a constitutionally respectable but otherwise intrusive and
unnecessary requirement.

We do not see why we should vote for a Bill that undermines the logic of
even the existing regulatory regime, when technology is running far ahead
of the law and the industries are crying out for a convergence of law,
which is DA policy. The department keeps promising such a law year after
year after year, while it keeps tabling measures which further compound and
confuse the present layers of alternately repetitive and contradictory
statutes.

It has reached a point where the National Association of Broadcasters
despairingly, I think, tabled a mammoth submission which, section by
section, proposed amendments not only to this Bill, but also to the rest of
the Broadcasting Act, and to the IBA Act, which underlies it and had been
watered down by the Broadcasting Act. No such luck, of course. We either
did not take their proposals on board, or took just the tiniest bit.

We did some of the same, with limited success, but could not persuade the
committee that clauses that similarly either repeat or alter the Public
Finance Management Act - which, of course, has application - should be
deleted. One tries, one fails.

The current regulatory regime still rests on the assumption that the
regulator conducts feasibility studies before it allocates scarce
frequency, and before it allows competition in markets where the available
advertising revenue indicates that viability might be a problem.

Government simply ignored this. The Government, which until now has been so
allergic to multilingualism that the existing 11 radio stations are called
by names that carefully avoid referring to the actual language, now wants
us to believe that the need for African language TV is so urgent that all
viability issues must be superseded.

Daar is ander maniere om ons Afrikatale te bevorder. Geld kon beskikbaar
gemaak geword het vir die herinstelling en uitbreiding van die
streekvensters van vroeër - hulle is weens koste afgeskaf - en daar is nuwe
tegnologieë, met nuwe moontlikhede. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[There are other ways to promote our African languages: money could have
been made available for the re-establishment and extension of erstwhile
regional windows - these were abolished for reasons of cost - and there are
new technologies with new possibilities.]

But most importantly, we feel disinclined to vote for a Bill which scrapes
by for constitutionality, but yet again reduces the safeguard against
interference. It sets a new precedent which will become the new principle
for the interpretation of section 192 of the Constitution, the section
setting up an independent broadcasting regulator.

The hon the Minister here sighted precedent, I would respond in the
following way on the third channel on which Parliament voted for the SABC:
That matter arose from a section of the 1993-94 IBA Act; it was an
injunction under that Act. It, therefore, preceded the final Constitution,
section 192, so other considerations applied and prevailed.

I would like to demonstrate to hon members just how the progressive erosion
of principle works by showing how the compromises of 1998 became the
principles of 2002. The debate about the control of broadcasting is not a
new one - control is the original goal. It is only the shock tactics that
are a new element in the strategy, it seems to me.

We had almost exactly the same debate in l998. When Minister Naidoo tried
to tamper with section 192 of the Constitution, the media featured him with
his face superimposed on TV screens, dictating the 8 o'clock news like PW
of old. Even the matter of the national interest was foreshadowed in the
Green Paper of l997, which invoked the``new national vision'' or
``identified national goals.

Minister Naidoo then planned for a strategic equity partner for the SABC,
just as this Bill kept referring, before amendment, to a period when the
state would no longer be the sole shareholder of the corporation.

We argued in 1998 - and we had to do it all over again now - that
Parliament does not under section 192 have the competence to authorise any
agency other that an independent broadcast regulator to regulate
broadcasting in the public interest. President Mandela was prepared to send
the then Broadcasting Bill back to Parliament at our request. It is the
compromise made at that point that became the new norm from which this Bill
retreats yet again.

In 1999 we succeeded in defeating the ministerial powers to issue
directives to the regulator. The compromise was that the Minister could
issue specific kinds of directives under certain conditions. It is
interesting that we came dangerously close to using one of those powers
this time, ie the power to determine priority for the development of
broadcasting. It seemed elegant enough at first to all of us, but in fact
it interrupts and subverts the regulator's own priorities for broadcasting.

In 1999 the regulator was given a certain set of absolutely exclusive
powers. It is because this provision may be interpreted as constituting a
limitation of Icasa's general powers that the National Association of
Broadcasters urged us now to reinstate the catch-all general powers the
regulator used to have under the IBA Act. This was not done.

The list of specific powers which neither Government nor Parliament may
interfere with, after the compromise of 1999, is naturally topped by
Icasa's right to license. Yet, here we are after the amendment, not quite
licensing by statute, but nevertheless requiring the SABC to apply to Icasa
for additional services. In theory it could refuse, and this is largely
what renders this provision constitutional.

But the remaining question - which I find to be very difficult - is whether
we are nevertheless indirectly constraining the regulator or usurping a
material aspect of its regulatory function. This, the Constitutional Court
has ruled in a comparable context, would be unconstitutional.

One could argue that this is not so, because we no longer say how many
channels there must be; in which geographical areas; and which languages
must cover them. On the other hand, we do the list the languages, we do set
a criterion for coverage. In addition, we intrude on the regulator's long-
term work on regional commercial services due to be licensed late in 2004.

We direct the SABC to ask for increased dominance of the broadcasting
landscape - its dominance is almost complete, practically - when the
regulator is supposed to encourage diversity. We allow the regulator to
determine the extent to which the services will draw on advertising
revenue, but any such revenue whatsoever will affect the vested rights of
existing licensees.

In fact, the reason why that Faraday cage is still blocking the broadcast
of Bop into Gauteng is that the IBA ruled that it would affect e-tv and
other services trying to achieve viability. Government wants Bop-TV for the
new services. It is because of this that such new services must be publicly
funded.

Public media funding is perhaps a desirable goal, many people want it, but
it is, of course, also exactly what the ANC is proposing in Umrabulo. This
holds dangers - they are inherent. [Interjections.]

Constitutionally, the new approach probably scrapes by as in 1999, but in
the process it creates a precedent. Politically the dangers are all too
clear. The Government wants to set up panic stations with public money,
because there is a popular revolt against its rule. All that stands in its
way now is a regulator which must insist on applying its own judgment. If
it does that without interference, then perhaps we can look forward to a
good result.

The other thing that stands in its way - and I wish to pay tribute here -
is an SABC board which has proved in this long process that it takes its
task of protecting free speech and editorial independence very seriously.
Those rights are now restored in this Bill. That board appears to me to be
taking them as seriously as they deserve to be taken and, therefore, I am
encouraged.

I cannot resist adding just one last footnote for its political, perhaps
historical, interest. In the course of legislating I had the pleasure to
move two Cosatu amendments, regrettably without success - perhaps the
combination was simply more than the ANC could bear.

We moved their excellent proposal that the memorandum and articles of
association to be drawn by the Minister should be submitted to public
scrutiny and parliamentary approval, and that we should approve any
alteration of share capital or sale of shares.

To colleagues from Cosatu, I really do regret that it was not accepted. I
think that their work is always excellent. We differ in many respects, but
there are others in which we concur. [Applause.]

Mr N N KEKANA: Madam Speaker, I think Dene spoilt the debate, I wish to
tell Comrade Aubrey, in this colourful House. Dene is spoiling this debate
just by being ... [Interjections.] Yes.

Many views have been expressed about the Broadcasting Amendment Bill before
this House today. If there is anything that was achieved, even before its
implementation, it was that it sparked off unprecedented national debate on
media-related issues. It successfully generated a great deal of national
interest and passionate public dialogue on the challenges facing the SABC.

It was encouraging to observe South Africans expressing their views and
stating their opinions without any fear of being prosecuted or arrested.
This is what is meant by freedom of speech, and the kind of public
discourse generated by this Bill must continue. Matters of national and
public interest are better addressed in an open and transparent manner. It
is this rich tradition and heritage from our national liberation struggle
that must be preserved for the benefit of future generations.

The DP argued for the withdrawal of the Bill, because they said that it
undermined freedom of expression. What a lame excuse, Madam Smuts! This
attitude is similar to the one displayed by the NP in the sixties who
delayed the introduction of television until 1976 because it threatened
`volkkultuur', stating that South Africa had to be protected from that evil
black box. This was what they called the television.

Today, the DP is displaying a similar approach. It is not surprising,
because they absorbed into their ranks the conservative right-wing elements
from the old NP. [Interjections.]

Soon after the Bill was tabled, the propoganda machine of the DP went into
action, shouting that media freedoms were being undermined. Even Mr
Holomisa of the UDM joined the lynching party and the self-righteous media
commandos who had, at last, found proof of abuse of power by the ANC
Government - so they claimed.
Ms M SMUTS: [Inaudible.]

Mr N N KEKANA: They were ululating and stating that the Government wanted
to turn the SABC into a mouthpiece and propoganda tool of the ANC. The ANC,
I must say, had no such intentions, and the hype and hysteria was
unnecessary. [Interjections.]

Unlike the right-wing political tradition that has inspired the DP, the ANC
is proud of its history and policies. The DP is guided by racist and
reactionary views such as those of Dr Albert Hertzog, the then Minister of
Post and Telegrams, who delivered combative and angry speeches in the
apartheid parliament in the 1960s, defending the non-introduction of
television in South Africa.

The SPEAKER: Order! Will you just take your seat for a moment, please?

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Is it permissible for the
hon member to refer to the party as `racist'?

HON MEMBERS: Yes!

The SPEAKER: Order! I heard `racist views'. I will check the Hansard and
see if it was the party referred to. [Interjections.]

Mr N N KEKANA: Madam Speaker, that hon member is not listening.

Although there were about 3 500 television stations across the globe in
1963, the apartheid government was determined that there would be no
introduction of television in South Africa. [Interjections.] This is those
hon members' history. African countries such as Ghana, Algeria, Egypt,
Kenya, Morocco and Zimbabwe, which was called Rhodesia then, introduced
television long before South Africa.

The apartheid regime used every trick in the book, and every piece of
research they could lay their hands on to justify their foolish actions.
Television was regarded as being the greatest destroyer of the family, and
poisonous to youth. They thought children would be retarded by television.
It was also regarded as a spiritual opiate or spiritual dagga.
[Interjections.] There they are!

Before they are tempted to agree with the family values approach, which
appears to be logical, here is the main reason. Speaking in Parliament on
22 May 1963 - hon members will find this in Hansard - Dr Hertzog said the
following about television:


  It will undermine the position of the white man in South Africa, and make
  the black man an even greater enemy of the white man.

Rob Nixon, in his Homelands, Harlem and Hollywood, further quotes him as
uttering the most racist and ridiculous statements in defence of why
television should not be introduced in South Africa. It is simply
unbelievable. It will make a box office movie, I must say.

Let me quote what Dr Hertzog said:


  It is afternoon ...

The hon members should listen carefully.


  ... and the Bantu houseboy is in the livingroom, cleaning the carpet.
  Someone has left the television set on. The houseboy looks up at the
  screen, sees a chorus line of white girls in scanty costumes. Suddenly,
  seized by lust, he runs upstairs, and rapes the madam.

[Interjections.] This is their own history. It is here. [Interjections.]

I wish he was alive today. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr N N KEKANA: We enquired about his whereabouts, and of course, who came
to explain where Dr Hertzog was? It was the hon Madam Dene Smuts! Hon Madam
Smuts confirmed, yesterday in our committee meeting, that indeed Dr Albert
Hertzog had died. It was not the New NP that said so. The apartheid regime
was so proud of this Dr Albert Hertzog that they even had the guts to name
the tall Hillbrow tower after him! [Interjections.] It was called the
Albert Hertzog Tower. Does the hon member remember?

Future generations must reject with contempt attempts by the DP, inspired
by the Hertzogs of this world, to deny the majority access to television by
maintaining the current marginalisation of African languages and culture.
Under the guise of affordability, the DP's member has argued - she has
written about it, like Dr Hertzog - she tells us that the television system
is an expensive system and it must be paid for. This was from the hon Dene
Smuts. [Interjections.]

South Africans demand that the SABC broadcast television programmes in
their own languages. It is a shame that today we are still talking about
the lack of coverage of African languages, including Afrikaans, on
television. While the industry and the public made valuable contributions,
certain political parties based their comments on suspicion and
superstition.

For the record, the ANC stated in its 1999 Election Manifesto, and in many
policy documents before 1994, that the SABC must be guaranteed its
independence. [Interjections.] Even the recent ANC policy conference
restated this policy statement. As living proof, we have before this House
an amending Bill that will improve the public broadcasting system and
provide a clear, legal and regulatory framework in the broadcasting
industry.

What lies behind the sensational and dramatic reaction to the Bill is the
itch to maintain the status quo, namely, television must continue to
broadcast a high level of foreign programming in a language that is not
accessible to the majority of South Africans. Let me say that an empty
vessel makes the loudest noise, and this is what Mr Holomisa and Ms Smuts
generated - a lot of hullabaloo that has since been replaced by a big,
embarrassing yawn. [Interjections.] Why? It is because all the so-called
concerns were addressed by a one-page amendment tabled by the ANC to
clarify the true intention of Government in addressing the relationship of
the SABC and the Minister.
The best that the DP could contribute in the committee was to make certain
technical reflections, but they agreed with the ANC amendments. They had no
alternative tabled, except to delete the so-called controversial section.
[Interjections.]

After the ANC amendment, there were suddenly no more grounds of
constitutionality, no more talks of obsession to gain control of the SABC.
This attempt to confuse and mislead the public has been frustrated, and all
South Africans will benefit immensely from this Bill. We have effected
changes that spell out clearly the role of the SABC Board in developing
policies and the necessary public participation in the formulation of these
policies.

The SABC is also, for the first time, through legislation, compelled to
consider regular inputs of public opinion on its broadcasting services. The
accountability of the SABC has been clarified, and the ANC is satisfied
with the provisions in the Bill to increase the answerability of the
broadcaster to the public. There is no more room to hide. All SABC policies
must be finalised by the Board after public comment. We deliberately
avoided stipulating a mechanism of public engagement, but we are hopeful
that the SABC Board will use its roving provincial board meetings to engage
locals, civic organisations, even political parties for that matter, to
improve the services and programmes of the public broadcaster.

Another matter that received considerable attention in the debate was the
relationship between the media, the public broadcaster and the advancement
of national interests or public interests. A certain Ivor Wechter, writing
for the IT Brainstorm magazine, asked the question that summed the
suspicion and superstition of media commandos who questioned the intention
of our democratically elected Government. He asked:


  If a democratic Government is inherently trustworthy, why is one of the
  basic tenets of democracy that the executive, legislative and judiciary
  branches of government be independent?

He continues to ask another question which betrays his true intention and
purpose in asking this question:


  Why would our Constitution not only call for parliamentary oversight and
  the jurisdiction, of course, over the executive, but also for a free
  press?

First, like all the other so-called proponents of free speech and freedom
of the media, he deliberately ignored section 16 of the Bill of Rights.
Like the DP and many of their neo-liberal believers, they are being
selective in their interpretation of freedom of expression. It is actually
in our democratic Constitution. [Interjections.]

Let me educate hon members a little bit. Section 16 of the Constitution
provides for the freedom of expression and states:


  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes -


  (a) freedom of the press and other media;

This is where Madam Smuts stops, as does the rest of the DP. The
Constitution, however, goes further. They conveniently omit that, in this
particular section, there is a further qualification which states that
there is the
  (b) freedom to receive or impart information or ideas;


  (c) freedom of artistic creativity, and


  (d) academic freedom and freedom of scientific research.

This is what the rest of section 16 says, but they conveniently omit this
particular part of section 16.

Given the full text of section 16, we should ask: How can South Africans
exercise this fundamental human right when they are not afforded an
opportunity to develop and broadcast local content, and thus realise their
artistic creativity? If the information they receive is not even in the
language they understand, how can they exercise this right if there appears
to be such blatant prejudices against their language?

The founding provisions of our Constitution directs the state to take
practical and positive measures to elevate the status and advance the use
of indigenous languages. Government is compelled to intervene and issue a
directive to the public broadcaster to address the language deficit of our
broadcaster. However, the current situation can easily result in litigation
against the state. [Interjections.] Any person or community whose language
is underrepresented on SABC television may take the state to court and
argue, successfully, that their language is being discriminated against.
The responsibility, therefore, lies with Government as it must give effect
to the guarantees of the Constitution.

The public radio stations of the SABC have been more successful in
promoting all languages of our country, but it is obvious to viewers that
television is not quite accessible. In the short term, multilingual
programming is the best way to address the language deficit on television.

While it is unrealistic to imagine that all 11 official languages will have
their own distinct television channels, the introduction of digital
terrestrial technology will assist in closing the gap between the usage of
English and the other 10 official languages. We are, today, through
legislation, directing the public broadcaster to deliver television
programmes in all official languages. There is nothing unconstitutional
about what we are doing.

We have, for the first time, through legislation, compelled the SABC to
develop a South African expression. The Minister has gone to great lengths
to address this particular matter. Not only must the SABC enjoy and
exercise freedom of expression, creative and journalistic independence, but
now there is a clear, spelt-out national obligation to the public of South
Africa. We believe that the SABC has a critical role to play in building
and shaping the moral fibre of our society and the building of a united and
patriotic nation.

We would like to say to the SABC management and journalists that while they
enjoy the rise that we are giving them, they also have obligations to the
public of this country. We decided to include in the Bill both national and
public interests without offering any outright definitions. The reason we
have done so is that we are convinced that there is nothing wrong in
stating that the public broadcaster must deliver programming to advance
national and public interests.

In fact, this Bill, compared to laws of other Commonwealth countries, is
very moderate. In our country, like all other democracies, the far-reaching
provisions of our Constitution are the brick and mortar that constitute
national interest. Whereas public interest tends to be populist and often
reflects fashionable views in society, national interests are all-
encompassing and inclusive. National interests should not be confused with
party-political interests. It is those like the DP spin doctors who often
conflate the two concepts in order to suppress discussion and debate on
this important subject of advancing national interests.

Recently, the coverage of news from an African perspective through SABC
Africa, now available on free-to-air television channels makes us proud as
Africans. The SABC must forge alliances with other public broadcasters on
the African continent and advance the African Union, Nepad and promote the
vision of an African renewal.

It is only through a free and independent public broadcaster and media that
many African countries can be protected from the rogue elements that seek
to topple democratically elected governments. Coup plotters usually target
and capture radio and television stations to announce their malevolent
intentions and deeds. It is therefore important for a country to have
multiple and varied radio, television and newspaper sources to make it coup-
free.

Although we must encourage the transformation of the advertising industry,
to recognise that they have a responsibility to support media diversity and
development in our country, the dependence of the SABC on advertising is
unhealthy. The advertising industry unreservedly supports programmes that
are aimed at the so-called white, English-speaking audiences.

The ANC believes that, in the coming years, the country must move towards a
public-funded model of the public broadcaster. Although the SABC must
continue to rely on mixed funding, which includes sponsorship grants, the
huge dependence on advertising must be reduced. Parastatals must use their
public relations budgets creatively through the sponsorship of local
content dramas.

The ANC, at its recent policy conference, resolved to encourage Parliament
to establish a dedicated radio and television channel to enable greater
participation and access by the public to the legislature. The idea of a
national youth station, as contained in the IBA triple inquiry report, must
be revived.

We received, all in all, 28 written public submissions, and we would like
to thank many of the industry players who have made a contribution towards
improving this Bill. All Bills before Parliament are subject to change,
subsequent to parliamentary submissions and hearings, which is a matter of
procedure in passing good law. We would like to thank the Minister, the
Director-General and the department as well as parliamentary staff,
including state law advisers, for working tirelessly to assist the
committee to deliver on time any matter before us. All political parties
have, over the years, shown a great level of co-operation and maturity in
dealing with matters of public and national interest before the committee.

The ANC supports this Bill, as amended.

Ms S C VOS: Chairperson, as we have heard, this Bill has not had an easy
birth. At its conception, to give it a more human face, it became evident
that this was an unwanted baby. The IFP unsuccessfully pleaded that it be
returned to its parents immediately, ie the Minister and her department.
This was one infant that we were not going to rock happily in its cradle.
Nobody cooed over this baby, we can assure you.

Red flags were raised across the land, and yet again our brightest legal
minds sharpened their pencils at vast expense to their clients. As is now
usual in the Portfolio Committee on Communications, a rescue mission was
mounted and after a somewhat difficult labour, we became the midwives to
this brand new product we have before us today.

Once again we are indebted to our chairperson, Mr Nkenke Kekana, who has
now firmly established in our committee a highly inclusive process of
allowing relevant and affected parties to constructively contribute to our
deliberations. All members have benefited enormously in past years from the
expertise that the ICT industry generously and regularly places at our
disposal. Unfortunately, they have little choice: many of the Bills placed
before us require extensive amendment, to put it kindly.

To put it bluntly, the question that really needs to be asked is why, time
and again, does the department think that it can get away with placing
before the very beady eyes of the well-honed committee, draft legislation
which is sometimes unconstitutional and often incoherent, notwithstanding
the hidden agendas. More often than not we receive Bills in which there is
more than one definition of the same subject matter, but these days that is
just a minor detail.

An alarming golden thread now weaves its way through much of the draft law
placed before us. It takes the form of consistent attempts by the
department to introduce direct executive control over broadcasting and
telecommunications in this country, in spite of constitutional and other
legislative constraints in this regard. There is a view, which the IFP
shares, that the Communications department now wants to claw back the power
correctly taken away from the state and placed in independent hands during
our constitutional negotiations, and in founding legislation immediately
post 1994.

The Constitution is quite clear: An independent authority must ``regulate
broadcasting in the public interest''. The Independent Communications
Authority of South Africa, Icasa, under the excellent leadership of Mr
Mandla Langa, has shown itself well up to the task of attempting to protect
its mandated role of independently regulating the broadcasting and
telecommunications sectors of our society.

But from where we sit in the communications committee - and if one listens
to the industry in general - there is no doubt that, while the department's
budget is awash with funds for myriad consultants, as well as empire-
building policy-making programmes and projects, Icasa is almost being
starved into submission. The department has a barely concealed,
contemptuous attitude to Icasa. The regulator is woefully underresourced
and denied the capacity to do its job properly. This House must correct
this wrong by urgently applying its mind to this matter.

The communications committee finds itself caught up in a turf war for the
control and manipulation of public and private broadcasting, and the
telecommunications industry in general. Given the intensely political
nature of the terrain of this battle, vigilance is required. One needs to
ask, for instance, why the Electronic Communications Security (Pty) Ltd
Bill has just been shepherded through the intelligence committee and not
where it obviously belongs, ie in the communications domain.

This Bill directly impacts on matters relating to the telecommunications
industry and has the fingerprints of the Department of Communications all
over it. Not all of us can surely be so naïve as to not wonder why it was
steered through the safer waters of the intelligence committee - surely
less intimately familiar with the subject matter - and, needless to say,
survived relatively intact. The stormy seas of the communications committee
would, no doubt, have been a different matter.

Over and over again in our committee we have to address matters of
constitutionality and ``executive creep'' into the public and private
domain of the ICT sector. It is no wonder that there are now some very
sharp lawyers in this country, who are more or less employed on a permanent
basis by relevant public and private players. Yet again, with this Bill
before us today, some of the country's top legal brains flew yet again into
Cape Town. There was no doubt on anybody's minds that the Broadcasting
Amendment Bill was unconstitutional and had vast implications in a number
of critical areas.

It must be noted that our public broadcaster and our regulator, let alone
the industry in general, as well as numerous representatives of civil
society, showed their mettle with this Bill. It was a joy to see them
defend democracy, freedom of speech and freedom of expression. That they
had to do so against a Government department is clearly cause for concern.

Matters that bounded off the pages of this Bill included attempts to exert
ministerial power over the reporting and editorial policies of the SABC. We
obviously stopped that in its tracks, and the SABC board must now submit
its policies to Icasa.

The Minister now says that all she wanted was for the public broadcaster to
be held accountable to the people it serves. She has got her wish. The SABC
will, as members have heard, now developed a code of practice, and it must
provide suitable means for regular input of public opinion.

So blatant was the intention to turn the public broadcaster into a state
broadcaster that the authors of the draft Bill were even so unsubtle as to
attempt to delete a previous statutory power, which said that the SABC
would ``enjoy freedom of expression and journalistic, creative and
programming independence.'' That clause, needless to say, has found its way
back into the Bill.

Another unconstitutional attempt to license regional television stations by
fiat, completely ignoring the regulator, Icasa, has also been cured. It is
not that the IFP and others have a problem with the development of regional
television services: we just do not think that the state should run them.
We think Icasa must apply its mind to all matters relating to broadcasting,
as it is mandated to do.

The IFP has long championed the principle of regional television and radio
broadcasting services. It is a cornerstone of IFP policy. We have long
argued that only they can really cater for the various language and
cultural needs, as well as the imperatives of the people of South Africa.

Way back in the heady post-1994 days, when we began drafting new
broadcasting and telecommunications laws, it was the IFP who called for
provincial public broadcasting funded from the public purse. At that time
we were accused of wanting apartheid and homeland broadcasting. Now, my,
have times changed!

Now, on and on we ploughed through this Bill. As members will hear time and
again, we have all but rewritten what started out as the shock-horror,
unconstitutional Broadcasting Amendment Bill. How it ever got through
Cabinet, in the first place, how it was not immediately eviscerated by the
state law advisers, is a mystery to many.

On the other hand, now that it is not unconstitutional and various other
matters too numerous to mention have also been redrafted, does the Minister
of Finance have any idea what is heading his way? Did Cabinet apply its
mind to the financial implications of the Bill, relating, specifically, to
the funding of the proposed regional television services?

This could well be a ``surprise, surprise, Mr Manuel!'' Bill, because we do
not think it has been costed at all. [Time expired.]

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, the New NP believes that great progress has been
made in Parliament's communications committee to bring the Broadcasting
Amendment Bill into conformity with the Constitution. The original draft
attracted a storm of protest because it proposed to make the SA
Broadcasting Corporation subject to the control of the Minister of
Communications in a manner which would infringe on the constitutional
provisions of freedom of speech and independence of the media.

We thank the committee and applaud the courageous stand taken by committee
chairperson Nat Kekana in engaging with the SABC and the industry
regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, on
these contentious issues. However, the communications director-general will
continue with his long- established practice of presenting either
unconstitutional or power-grabbing draft legislation to the committee in
the future, and we will deal with it.

The promulgation of this Bill will represent a breakthrough in bringing a
future of greater transparency and public trust in the SABC. The Bill's
original proposal to make the SABC's editorial language and journalistic
policies subject to ministerial approval had been replaced by their
referral to Icasa, which is responsible for ensuring that the SABC complies
with its founding charter.

The New NP is glad that the ANC supported our proposal that the amending
Bill also provide for public participation in policy making. With regard to
the legislative creation of two new regional television channels to cater
for other national languages and Icasa's licensing role, the committee has
decided that the provision for this would be accommodated in the new
licence to be issued in the SABC when it is incorporated as a public
company.

An outstanding matter was a clause allowing the Minister to decide on what
limitations should be placed on the cross- ownership of the media. We are
concerned that this would be a unilateral decision by the executive, and
hoped that the clause would be amended to require Icasa to submit a report
to Parliament which would then make a decision.

The Broadcasting Amendment Bill of 2002 has raised a fair amount of
headline-grabbing controversy around the issue of the SABC's editorial
independence. But Government's intention to create new channels to promote
indigenous languages is commendable.

The Government has finally recognised that the current position violates
the constitutional status of these languages. A public broadcaster must
ensure fair and equitable representation of all languages in its full range
of programming. One does not need to be an African cultural nationalist to
appreciate that there is a large body of African views in need of a
broadcasting presence.

However, when your three channels are dedicated to national broadcasting
and 11 national languages have to be accommodated, the crux becomes more
complicated than the ideal. There are commercial realities. In a global
context, where television has to respond to commercially-driven
competitors, where will the money for these channels come from? Who out
there is going to finance the costs of producing Tshivenda documentaries,
dramas and comedies? Who out there is going to foot the Bill for news-
gathering and reporting in Afrikaans, including the cost of training Tswana
journalists and reporting from the North West?

Where will the money for these channels come from? From the state!
Government must accept the fact that the public broadcaster must be
subsidised. The SABC's management and board have confirmed in recent debate
that the language requirement and the public broadcasting mandate is
something they cannot afford. According to current research, these
languages draw audiences from fewer views and are therefore not highly
attractive to advertisers.

The recognition that 10 of the 11 official languages are marginalised in
television is long overdue. But as is evident, there must be practical
steps to achieve the policy goals. The implementation will have to make
sense, as well as be affordable and viable. A possibility is to spread the
11 official languages across the existing three SABC channels and the
proposed two new channels. This would ensure representation of languages
across channels, rather than have a concentration within a channel. In this
scenario, particular channels could specialise in at least two languages
for the main news bulletin and specific genres outside of news, drama and
documentaries.

Die Nuwe NP se uitgangspunt is dat die SABC die infrastruktuur en die
bedrewendheid het om aan ons 'n stelsel te verskaf wat 'n maksimum aan taal-
 en kultuurvryheid en uitdrukking sal toelaat - die voorvereiste vir
versoening.

Ons benadering is ook in ooreenstemming met die beginsels en riglyne van
die nuwe Uitsaaiwet. Die tegnologie begunstig dus kulturele en
taaldiversiteit. Dit beteken dat ``die eter so wyd is soos God se genade''
en dat die moderne tegnologie 'n gawe is van God om ``te leef en te laat
leef'', asook vir die voorsiening van kulturele Lebensraum in 'n tyd van
onophoudelike konflik op ander vlakke. Die tegnologie laat ons toe om te
differensieer sonder diskriminasie.

Die Nuwe NP sal hierdie wetsontwerp steun. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The New NP's point of departure is that the SABC has the infrastructure
and the skill to provide us with a system which will allow a maximum of
language and cultural freedom and expression - the prerequisite for
reconciliation.

Our approach is also in agreement with the principles and guidelines of the
new Broadcasting Act. The technology thus favours cultural and linguistic
diversity. This means that ``the ether is as wide as God's grace'' and that
modern technology is a gift from God ``to live and let live'', also for the
provision of cultural Lebensraum at a time of continuous conflict on other
levels. Technology allows us to differentiate without discrimination.

The Ne NP will support this Bill.]

Mnr S ABRAM: Mnr die Voorsitter, wanneer die Kabinet 'n konsepwetsontwerp
oorweeg vir tertafellegging, en daarvoor goedkeuring verleen, is dit uiters
belangrik dat behoorlik gekyk en aandag gegee word aan sowel grondwetlike
as finansiële implikasies. Ons het nou net hier gehoor dat die wetsontwerp
voorsiening maak vir die SABC om alle landstale eweredig te bevorder. Dit
het geweldige en ernstige finansiële implikasies. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[MR S ABRAM: Mr Chairperson, when the Cabinet considers a draft Bill for
tabling and grants approval for that, it is of the utmost importance that
both constitutional and financial implications are looked at properly and
receive thorough attention. We have just heard here that the Bill makes
provision for the SABC to promote all of the official languages equally.
This has enormous and serious financial implications.]

As far as the Bill itself is concerned, I will be failing in my duty if I
did not pay tribute to the chairperson and members of this committee, who
worked extremely long hours. The chairperson, who possesses very special
powers that enable him to take a lot of criticism, is always willing and
prepared to listen to varying viewpoints and, in the end, get them together
to find, by way of consensus, a settlement which will please practically
everybody.

I realise that, as an opposition party member, I cannot expect everything
that we want to be part of the end product. Of course, by the very nature
of our presence here, it means that there has to be a great deal of give
and take. Amongst the more contentious clauses in the original Bill as
published were clauses 6 and 15. Clause 6 has been totally rewritten. It is
a totally new clause, whilst clause 15, which sought to insert a new
section 13(a) in Act 4 of 1999, was dropped. The objectionable clauses
which one feared would place power in the hands of a political functionary
have, therefore, disappeared.
In terms of section 192 of the Constitution, Act 108 of 1996, national
legislation must establish an independent authority to regulate
broadcasting in the public interest, and to ensure fairness and a diversity
of views broadly representing South African society. The Bill addresses
this matter by expressly referring to public interest. Although various
interpretations of public interest exist, it seems that the amending
legislation places the focus on matters such as freedom of expression, as
well as journalistic, creative and programming independence as enshrined in
the Constitution, in accordance with the newly inserted clause 1 of Bill
34A of 2002.

In order to give expression to South Africa's constitutional obligation, it
is proposed that the new SABC should offer plurality of views and a variety
of news, information and analyses. It follows that an integral part of such
a plurality of views includes the SABC's news, editorial policy,
programming, local content, educational universal service and access, as
well as language and religious policy. These obligations are fairly self-
explanatory in giving effect to the prominent constitutional obligation of
access to information, which in terms of section 32 of the Constitution,
means that everyone has the right to access to information held by the
state, and any information held by another person that is required for the
exercise of protecting any rights. [Time expired.]

Mrs W S NEWHOUDT-DRUCHEN: Chairperson and hon members, according to our
Constitution everyone has the right to use the language and to participate
in the cultural life of their choice. Everyone also has the right of access
to information. But access to information must be provided in the language
understood by all. The SABC must reflect the multilingual and diverse
nature of South Africa. Thus far the SABC has not provided for all the
official languages in their programming.

Why is the emphasis on language so important? It is because we talk and
communicate every day, and information goes around every day. It is
important that children learn a language, so that they can communicate with
their own family members. Outside their home environment they need to
communicate with other members of society.

We have members of the disabled community who are deaf. Deafsa statistics
show that there are 4 million deaf and hard-of-hearing people living in
South Africa. Of that number, approximately 1,6 million use sign language
as their first language of communication. Sign language is a visual
language. By that I mean that the deaf do not use their ears to access
information; instead, they use their eyes. If they cannot use their eyes to
communicate, they are cut off from obtaining information everyday.

One way of obtaining information is via the television. For a deaf person,
this is one of the best ways, because TV is visual to us. But we do not
receive information via television, as it is mostly inaccessible to us, the
deaf community. The deaf community cannot understand what is going on on
TV. We who are deaf have to play a guessing game as to what has been said
on TV.

A deaf person came to make a presentation at the public hearings we had. He
said the first time he went to America he sat for 17 hours watching TV,
because all the programmes were captioned. For the first time, he was able
to understand what was said on TV.

We also have members of the disabled community who are blind. About 0,6% of
the South African population is either blind or partially sighted. There
are some frustrating times when they do not know what is going on on TV,
for example when something happens very quietly and there is no sound where
people can see what is happening, but the blind cannot.

People who are blind do not know what colours are on TV as well. They need
things to be described to them. Both deaf and blind people are expected to
pay for their TV licences, yet they do not have full access to TV
programmes.

One of the resolutions taken at the ANC national policy conference is that
the public broadcaster must ensure that its television programmes have
close captioning, sign language and other means, to cater for the deaf
community. I am happy to say that this new Broadcasting Amendment Bill has
added that to the objectives of the Broadcasting Act, Act 4 of 1999, which
states that the SABC must be responsive to the audience's needs, including
the needs of the deaf and the blind, and account on how those needs will be
met. This is an achievement for us as the ANC.

What is necessary is that the deaf community must have access to television
programmes, either through sign language or via captioning. Let me give hon
members an example of sign language programmes. The news and some
educational programmes for children are interpreted into sign language. I
am happy that that provision has been met.

Captioning differs from subtitles, in that the words are coloured and are
positioned to indicate who is speaking. It also provides information on the
music and the sound effects, which may be important to the understanding of
the programme.

Subtitling only places words in other languages at the bottom of the
screen. Deaf people will be able to read and understand what is happening
on the TV programme. This will not only benefit us as the deaf community,
but will also benefit people who can hear but cannot read and write, namely
the hearing children, youth and adults. Adults will also be able to learn
to read via captioning or subtitling.

People who are blind should be provided with video descriptive services. A
visually disabled person will be able to hear via headphones a description
of whatever and whoever is on the screen. This will help them understand
better what is happening on TV. We know that having access to information
via TV in our own language is very important.

South Africa has 11 official languages, but the SABC does not broadcast in
all the official African languages of South Africa. Language allocation
during prime time, that is, between 6pm and 10pm, shows that English is the
only language on SABC 3, as quoted in the 2002 Annual Review Report.
Approximately 50% of prime time on SABC 2 is in English, followed by
Afrikaans, which is 30%, and 12% for Sotho languages. More than 70% of
prime time on SABC is in English, while only 15% is allocated to Nguni
languages.

The new Broadcasting Amendment Bill aims to change this. Under this
amending Bill the SABC is mandated to provide regional television services.
This means that the SABC will be licensed to provide additional television
services which will be broadcast regionally into our African languages such
as Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, Siswati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans,
Isindebele, Isixhosa and isiZulu in the respective regions on an equal
basis.

At every meeting when the SABC reports to the Portfolio Committee on
Communications, the complaints have always been the same: ``There is no
money.'' Well, now we have the objectives in law and the SABC must provide
the means of access for the deaf and the blind. The amending Bill says that
regional services provided by the SABC must be funded by money appropriated
by Parliament. There will be no financial implications prior to the passing
of this Bill, but there will be financial implications for the
implementation processes.

We hope that TV services are already included in the next financial year's
Budget. But we anticipate that next year's services to people with
disabilities, as well as regional services, will definitely be included in
that Budget. If the SABC wants money from the Government and if they want
regional services to be successful, they must be accountable for proper
financial regulations.

We expect that at the end of next year the licensing process for these
regional services will be completed, up and running and providing these
services.

The provision of services to cater for the various languages and for access
by people with disabilities is not the responsibility of the SABC only, but
of other broadcasting companies as well, such as e-tv, M-Net and others.
Icasa must make sure that this is included in the license conditions for
all.

To end, I would like to congratulate ourselves on the completion of this
amending Bill, and to thank all involved for their hard work. I would also
like to thank those who took part in the presentations and public hearings,
to enable us as members of Parliament to be more sensitive to the needs of
others in our country.

The ANC supports the amending Bill.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, the Orwellian concept of a government
controlling the thoughts of a nation through the mass media is a dangerous
concept.

With regard to the initial introduction of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill
by the Minister, there was an understanding or interpretation to the effect
that this was an attempt by Cabinet to introduce the Big Brother concept
into our broadcasting legislation. This has been temporarily stopped, but
unless this kind of determinant thinking pattern is itself controlled,
Government will mostly likely introduce similar pieces of legislation in
the future.

Public broadcasting should be the most transparent of all media
engagements, since it is less directed by private interest. Ironically,
public interest seems to be interpreted by Government to mean ``politically
owned'' through what it terms national interest, captured in clause 4(d) of
the Bill. South Africa has a Constitution that endorses a public policy
where the rights of all citizens are guaranteed, protected and
substantiated on the basis on the basis of democracy, pluralism and
diversity.

The Broadcasting Amendment Bill wanted to negate all of these values, wrest
them from the public domain and then vest, in the case of this Bill, all
authority in the Minister, who would finally decide what information is
palatable or compatible for public consumption.

We are glad to state that such Orwellian measures have been stopped dead in
their tracks. The Broadcasting Amendment Bill is now handed back to the
public, with the responsibility on corporations such as the SABC to ensure
proper regulatory measures to meet the public's diverse needs. The
contributory role of Icasa becomes relevant in this regard.

However, the SABC should be required to reflect a diverse business culture,
and does not need Icasa to regulate such practices. We must strive for is
guaranteed independence for the SABC. This victory was achieved through
multiparty effort and public support in general.

The point the ACDP wishes to highlight in this regard is that the people of
this country value their independence and freedom from control. The SABC
should, therefore, take clear notice of this and realise from the onset
that its mandate is a public mandate, and not a Government or party-
political mandate.

In view of its independence, the SABC must draw a definite line where the
public funding of the media is found to have a contributory influence.
[Interjections.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, the PAC supports the Broadcasting Amendment
Bill. This Bill is amending the Broadcasting Act of 1999. Its purpose,
inter alia, is to add certain definitions, as well as clarify the
relationship between the policies governing public commercial services and
the values of broadcasting services.

The Bill also provides for the application and granting of television
licences, the imposing of penalties for failure to pay television licence
fees and the appointment of inspectors. It is important that people paying
for their television licences also watch, to a large degree, what interests
them.

Languages that are neglected on television, such as Tshivenda and Xitsonga,
must be considered. It does not make sense to talk of 11 official languages
in the Constitution of this country while they are treated as if they are
not equal. The time allocated to these languages must be equal. At present
some languages get more than their share. How are viewers expected to pay
for their licences when they do not get value for their money?

The SABC television seems to be reluctant to cover events in rural areas
and in other African countries. Of course, democracy will not thrive in our
country if the SABC is concerned only with the activities of the ruling
party and does not give reasonable coverage to political parties which are
not in Government. Supporters of these parties pay their TV licences so
that, among other things, they can watch the activities of the parties they
support.

I want to emphasize that the SABC can play an important role in nation-
building in this country if it promotes the important cultural values of
our country. That would create political stability, accelerate economic
development and eradicate poverty.

I cannot go into other matters.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Dr S E M PHEKO: The PAC supports this Broadcasting Amendment Bill.

Mr M A MAYIZA: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister of Communications, hon members,
it is common knowledge that for many years the majority of our people were
not afforded the opportunity to watch television in the languages of their
choice, but were compelled to learn and enjoy the next best language chosen
for them by those in the broadcasting industry.

It is, therefore, with this knowledge in mind that clause 26 of the Bill
introduces a new provision for the establishment of two regional television
services in the country. This will assist the national broadcaster in
rolling out programmes in indigenous languages, which are currently not
adequately covered by the national broadcaster.

In relation to these two regional television services, the Bill further
provides for the establishment of one or more corporate entities, which
must be licensed to service either of the regional services. These
corporate entities must be financed by the state.

However, the possible public and private investor participation through
advertisements is not ruled out. The advantages of the proposed funding by
the state are extensive, amongst which one may tabulate a few.

Firstly, the fact that television, as part of the media in general, is a
highly contested terrain which is therefore not neutral, indicates that
major reliance on private or public investment by these corporate entities
will have undesired implications on their independence.

Secondly, the influence that private and public investment has on
television and the media in general has the capacity to undermine the
Government's objective of ensuring the development of local content and
local language usage in the regional services.

The Bill proposes stringent methods of licence fee collection, by
introducing penalties and prosecution. The current licensing provisions are
reinforced and, in addition thereto, any person who defaults on the payment
of licence fees may be liable to pay to the SABC a penalty to the amount
equal to double the amount of the applicable licence fee. This penalty will
be in addition to the prescribed licence fee which the defaulter will still
be liable to pay.

For many years people have refused to pay licence fees, using the excuse
that they were not being employed or claiming poverty, while they could
still afford to buy television sets, hence the reinforcement of these
stringent payment methods.

However, in the introduction of these stringent measures, we have not lost
sight of the fact that there are people who genuinely deserve some relief
from licence fees. It is in this regard that the Bill provides for
exemptions as may be prescribed by the Minister through the regulations.

On the other hand, some people have argued that they do not even watch
television, since their languages are not catered for. They say that they
are, therefore, refused access to the television. The two regional
television services that I have mentioned earlier will ensure the
development of all languages, including sign language. The development of
sign language will attract the 4 million deaf audience who are refusing to
pay licence fees, claiming that the current language usage does not cater
for them.

Dealers and businesses have also not escaped the net of licence fees. In
the event that a television set is released without proof of a licence, the
dealer shall, on conviction, be liable for the payment of a fine of R3 000
for every set so released, but not exceeding a total amount of R10 000.

There has been confusion as to whether a person must have one television
licence for each television set that one has, or whether it is sufficient
for a person to have only one television licence for all television sets
that one has. The Bill makes it clear that a person must have a television
licence for each television set that one has.

For purposes of accounting, the Bill also dictates the requirements for
proper financial accounting systems as prescribed by the Public Finance
Management Act, as it provides for the yearly submission of audited
budgeting reports to Parliament. It is, of course, a fact that the only
interference of Government and Parliament shall arise in instances where
there is failure on the part of the board to account properly, as the Bill
demands.

I want to draw hon members' attention to the fact that the ANC, since
taking over power, has always demonstrated its commitment to the freedom of
the press and noninterference policy. I further want to express that this
belief is still in the proposed policies for the coming conference of the
ANC.

The Bill calls for the authority to monitor and enforce compliance with the
charter by the corporation. It is on the basis of this commitment that I
would like to reassure the opposition parties that their continuous
pretence of concern regarding interference with the freedom of the media
emanates from their previous practice.

I would also like to emphasise that our commitment to our Constitution and
the Bill of Rights is what we will not sacrifice. Hence the said
development of a wide range of programmes that reflect South African
attitudes, opinions, ideas, values and artistic creativity without
undermining the rights of the television viewers.

Participation by the public in the development of the policies referred to
in the Bill is also a key factor, for it calls on the public to assist in
ensuring a quality service and ownership. We are talking about a public
service here. How can it be a public service if the public has to accept
what is imposed upon them?

The Bill also gives the authority the right or power to question and
monitor the corporation, since the authority is entitled, in terms of the
licence conditions, to know if the corporation is not in compliance.

I want to draw to the Minister's attention the fact that some members of
the other parties, especially those from the ACDP, are an embarrassment by
coming here and telling stories, for they never took part in the
deliberations on this Bill. For them to come here and confuse the House is
unfortunate.

I also want to bring to their attention the fact that one will always see
the interference of the ACDP in those broadcasting stations that are owned
by these religious people. Their reaction is based on the fact that this is
what they do, for they do not understand or believe in the freedom of the
press. They do not even believe that the press has the authority to assist
this country to develop. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, broadcasting media, whichever or whoever they
may be, and all of us, have been severely held back and hampered and
tampered with and suffered many other forms of abuse by the apartheid
regime. The MF is glad to see that broadcasting in South Africa, that also
suffered under apartheid, is undergoing the necessary transformation
process.

It is important for all licence holders to enjoy the programmes. The
broadcasting industry is very important. It is our window to the world.
Whether it is a documentary, educational TV or just a movie or soapy like
The Bold and the Beautiful, our people are watching and learning. The
question that is then often asked is: If broadcasting plays such an
important part in our day-to-day lives, should the material to be broadcast
not be overseen and monitored to rather exhibit programmes that will
instill good moral values in our society?

Good moral values are personally instilled and not necessarily influenced
by the media. For instance, there might be a documentary on nightclubs and
drugs, but it might not entice viewers to take on these habits. What is
important, is that parental guidance and such strategies exist to monitor
certain explicit movies and I sincerely hope that they do.

The most important factor, however, is the shift in broadcasting from the
minority to the greater majority. We have seen a major shift in TV with
more people of colour being introduced to the system. The increase in local
productions and so forth is also encouraging with regard to the talented
material that our society has to offer. The multichannel distribution
service, which must apply, is most welcome. We also hope that in the near
future the Indian language will also be included.

The MF supports the Broadcasting Amendment Bill.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Geagte Voorsitter, 'n oom in my gemeente het altyd, as 'n
mens hom vra of dit goed gaan met die gesondheid, geantwoord, ``Dominee, op
my ouderdom gaan dit net beter; dit gaan nie goed nie.'' (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, whenever this older gentleman in my
congregation was asked about his state of health, he would always answer:
``Reverend, much improved for my age, but I am not well''.]

The moral of the story is that better is not necessarily good. That is the
case with this Bill. After inputs by opposition parties and civil
organisations, the Bill is better, but still not good enough to get our
support.

'n Bekende taktiek in die sakewêreld is die volgende. Die prys van 'n
artikel van R100 word opwaarts aangepas tot R200. As jy hom dan vir R150
koop, dink jy jy het 'n winskoop gekoop, en dan dink jy sommer ook die
winkelier is 'n gawe kêrel. Intussen het jy steeds R50 te veel betaal.

Die aanvanklike bepalings van hierdie wetsontwerp was soos daardie R200
prysetiket, totaal onaanvaarbaar, met die Minister wat beheer kry oor die
beleid van die SABC, en totaal onkonstitusioneel, soos duidelik uitgewys.
Nou dink die ANC ons gaan tevrede wees met R150.

Die AEB sê nee. Ons het twee besware. Eerstens is daar gans te veel
wetsvoorskrifte wat die Onafhanklike Kommunikasie-owerheid en die raad van
die SABC bind hul onafhanklikheid in die gedrang bring. Wetsvoorskrifte,
moet lede onthou, dra altyd die stempel van die meerderheidsparty, en dra
dus 'n sterk politieke karakter.

Tweedens word die Kommunikasie-owerheid in sy beleid gebind, nie net aan
die openbare belang nie, maar aan die nasionale belang. Hierdie nasionale
belang word maklik herdefinieer as die  staatsbelang. Die staatsbelang word
weer, in die volgende asem, die regeringsbelang en weg is die noodsaaklike
onafhanklikheid en word die openbare uitsaaier uiteindelik ``his master's
voice''.

Hou verder in gedagte dat die Minister, by die aanvang van die debat oor
hierdie wetsontwerp, spesifiek gekla het dat die pers nie die regering se
boodskap goed oordra nie.

Verder is die vraag of met hierdie nasionale belang dalk bedoel word een
algemene konsensus wat diversiteit en verskil van mening uitskakel as
irrelevante randverskynsels en van die openbare uitsaaier 'n monochroom-,
eenstemmige koor wil maak. Die wetgewing is beter, maar nog nie goed nie.
Die AEB kan dit nie steun nie.

Mag ek ten slotte die agb Kekana gelukwens met sy kennis van die antieke
geskiedenis. Dr Albert Hertzog het reeds in 1969 die destydse regerende
party verlaat, min of meer die tyd toe die agb Kekana gebore is.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[The following is well-known tactics in business. The price of an article
of R100 is marked up to R200. So when you buy it for R150, you think you
have bought a bargain, and you think the shopkeeper is a nice guy.
Meanwhile you have still paid R50 too much.

The initial provisions of this Bill were like that R200 price tag; totally
unacceptable, with the Minister gaining control over the SABC's policies,
and totally unconstitutional, as was clearly pointed out. Now the ANC
thinks we are going to be satisfied with R150.

The AEB says no. We have two objections. Firstly, there are far too many
legislative provisions binding the Independent Communication Authority and
the board of the SABC, compromising its independence.

Secondly, as regards policy the Communication Authority is being linked not
only to public interest, but also to national interest. This national
interest is easily redefined as state interest. With the next breath, state
interest in turn becomes government interest, gone is the essential
independence and the public broadcaster eventually becomes ``his master's
voice''.
Also keep in mind that the Minister, at the start of the debate on this
Bill, complained in particular about the press not having properly conveyed
the Government's message.

The question is further whether this national interest could refer to one
general consensus which eliminates diversity and difference of opinion as
irrelevant fringe phenomena, attempting to turn the public broadcaster into
a monochrome, undiversified choir. This legislation has been improved, but
it is still not a good law. The AEB cannot support it.

Finally, may I congratulate the hon Kekana on his knowledge of ancient
history. Dr Albert Herzog had already left the erstwhile ruling party by
1969, more or less the time when the hon Kekana was born.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, now that this Bill is to be made law,
Azapo calls on the board of the SABC to involve all sections of our
community in a meaningful way when it consults the people for the
formulation of the charter of co-operation.

Closest to Azapo's heart is the question of local content, because the
broadcasting must reflect the identity and diverse nature of our society.
Our national television ranks highest among priorities that have to be
considered. At the moment all three SABC channels could easily pass for
European channels. The quantity of foreign material is overwhelming. It is
so overwhelming that it is also reflected in the style and content of
locally produced material. The humour, the settings and the
characterisation are all foreign. This is not acceptable. Our national
television must be seen to reflect the identity and diverse nature of our
society.

The treatment of languages by our public broadcaster has, up to now, not
been satisfactory. Now that the Bill has been completed, there can no
longer be any reasonable justification by the board of the SABC to delay
the implementation of the content of this Bill. There can never be any
justification for not having the ability to practise an equitable language
policy on the basis that there is no legislation. There is legislation now.
The equitable distribution of language policy must then occur.

Azapo supports this Bill.
Mnr R D PIETERSE: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek dink die feit dat agb Aucamp hier
gestaan het, is alreeds 'n ``bargain''. Ek dink hy moet nie meer
``bargains'' soek nie, want dan moet ons hom natuurlik daarop wys dat hy
glad nie 'n vergadering bywoon nie. Ek gaan die agb Green die verleentheid
spaar en nie oor sy afwesigheid praat nie. Hy moet ophou om hier skynheilig
te wees vir almal en te probeer preek. Hy kom nie na een vergadering nie en
het allerhande verskonings.

Mej Smuts, wat die Engelse weergawe van die AWB verteenwoordig, het ons
natuurlik gewys tot watter hoogtes sy kan gaan met haar gekkery. Sy was 'n
absolute ``clown'', en ons aanvaar dit want dit is deel van haar party se
kultuur. Gisteraand het hulle natuurlik verskonings gesoek om te drink en
dit 'n ``celebration'' genoem. Waarvoor, weet ek nie. Natuurlik kry ons
almal verskonings vir hoekom ons ons wil oorgee aan die drank, soos die DA
gisteraand. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr R D PIETERSE: Mr Chairperson, I think the fact that the hon Aucamp has
stood here is already a bargain. I do not think that he should look for
more bargains, because then we would of course have to point out to him
that he never attends any meetings. I am going to spare the hon Green the
embarrassment of talking about his absence. He should stop being a
hypocrite here and trying to preach to everyone. He does not attend a
single meeting and has all sorts of excuses.

Miss Smuts, who represents the English version of the AWB, has of course
shown us to what lengths she can go with her clowning. She was an absolute
clown and we accept that, because it is part of her party's culture. Last
night they were naturally looking for excuses to drink and called it a
celebration, for I do not know what. Of course, all of us find excuses for
indulging ourselves in alcohol, as the DA did last night. [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Smuts, are you rising on a
point of order?

Ms M SMUTS: Chairperson, it was not easy to follow the hon member. What was
he saying? That the DA drank last night? What is he referring to? Would you
kindly consider whether that is parliamentary or not? I do not think he was
referring to me.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member. I was trying
very, very carefully to follow what he was saying. So far, what he said
does not appear to have had a direct impact on any individual member. If he
had crossed that line, I would have called him to order.

Mnr R D PIETERSE: Dit is maar die storie. Sy het nie reg gehoor nie. Dit is
'n geval van die skoen wat druk, sodra ons van drank praat.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr R D PIETERSE: That is the story: She did not hear correctly. It is a
case of the shoe's pinching as soon as we talk about alcohol.
[Interjections.]]

``Pay your TV licence, it is the right thing to do!''

As I rise on behalf of the ANC on to support this Broadcasting Amendment
Bill, I want to repeat what I said: As a proud South African, please pay
your TV licence! It is the only thing to do!

I want to dedicate this input of mine to the children of our beloved
country, as this is the Month of the Child in terms of the Letsema
campaign. But I also want to pay homage to them, as they are often
forgotten when we pursue the transformation of our country.

When this Bill was first introduced, there was a huge outcry as to whether
or not it was constitutional to make the SABC ``His Master's Voice.'' The
hon the Minister and the DG of the Department of Communications have on
many occasions assured the industry, in particular the SABC, of its
continued independence and no interference from herself, her good office or
from the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Communications, Mr
Nkenke Kekana. The chairperson was once again at his brilliant best when he
steered the committee and the discussion on this rocky road, and one needs
to thank him for the outstanding role he has played to get the committee
and the industry players to agree that this is a very good piece of
legislation.

The Bill facilitates a process that would allow the SABC, while retaining
its mandate, to educate, entertain and inform, as well as split into public
and commercial services. It is also important to note that we have removed
the wording - ``while the state is the sole shareholder'', because it sent
wrong signals to ordinary South Africans and played into the hands of those
who propagated that we must privatise everything at all cost. The public
broadcaster belongs to the people and is a national asset.

This public broadcasting service will definitely not be boring. It will
focus on education and will inform the public in a very creative way. I
must stress that this will not be easy to achieve, but is achievable if we
all play our positive part.

Whilst the SABC and its subcommittees are facing the challenge of replacing
the management board, they must ensure much more or and greater
transparency in the commissioning of programmes. This Africa will rise like
a giant phoenix, soaring across the globe in the face of adversaries, and
the SABC must be there to cover it.

We have seen the global reality from a South African perspective and I want
to encourage hon members to watch SABC Africa. Education and information
about the AU and Nepad, our economic programme, should be taken to the
people. The public broadcasting services should be there and involved, and
should even take the lead.

The public broadcasting service must and will showcase the real South
Africa. It must tell the South African story through their creative works,
and allow South Africa to express itself to its people. If I could suggest
any story to illustrate South Africa in its finest form, then it is to
focus on the South African women. We have enough material about the quality
and success of our African women to last us a couple of years. I urge the
SABC not to close their eyes or to ignore the quality of the ready-made
material on our African women.

Ek dink dadelik aan 'n vrou soos Sara Bartmann, wat op 'n jong ouderdom
weggerokkel is na Engeland toe, en in Frankryk moes werk as prostituut, en
ook later daar gesterf het. Sy is verlei deur 'n Engelse heer wat ook as
mediese dokter gewerk het. Meer as honderd jaar later bring ons Regering -
en ons moet oplet, nie sommer enige regering nie, maar 'n ANC-regering -
haar oorskot terug en sorg vir haar ordentlike begrafnis.

Dit is hierdie soort oorwinning teenoor die felste aanval op teen ons vroue
wat vertel moet word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I immediately think of a woman like Sara Bartmann, who was lured to
England at an early age and had to work as a prostitute in France, where
she died later. She was seduced by an English gentleman who also worked as
a medical doctor. More than a hundred years later our Government - and we
must take note, not any old government, but an ANC Government - has
returned the remains and ensured her decent burial.

This is the kind of triumph over the harshest attack on our women that must
be mentioned.]

Soul City is another good example of public service. While covering health
issues, this programme educates, is solid, but still very entertaining. We
are waiting with bated breath for more talk shows and actuality programmes,
particularly in languages other than Afrikaans and English. Stop giving us
excuses!

Ons kan onder geen omstandighede aangaan met verskonings dat ons moedertale
afgeskeep en dikwels geïgnoreer word nie. [Under no circumstances can we
continue making excuses that our mother tongues are being neglected and
often ignored.]
The SABC should grit its teeth and execute its language mandate. We have
award-winning programmes such as Special Assignment which raise issues that
are uppermost in the minds of our people and get them to talk about them.

Fokus met Freek is 'n ander program wat baie goed en insiggewend is.
Voorleggings deur Deafsa dui daarop dat baie Suid-Afrikaners hardhorend is,
of selfs doof. Van hulle het selfs meer as een gestremdheid en vind dit dus
moeilik, of selfs onmoontlik, om met die wêreld te kommunikeer, soos gesien
deur die oë van die uitsaaier.

Hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp maak voorsiening vir die regstelling daarvan
en dus sal gebaretaal, sowel as drukskrif, binnekort op beeldradio's gesien
word.

Ons kan nie die fout maak om tale teen mekaar uit te speel of politiek
daarvan te maak nie. Ons moet in dieselfde asem gelykwaardige tyd aan al
ons amptelike tale gee. Die huidige raad van die SABC sal hier 'n oorhoofse
rol speel, met programme wat die publiek sowel as kommersiële
uitsaaidienste sal bestuur. Hierdie struktuur laat natuurlik toe dat daar
baie gefokusseer word op die detail van die mandaat en die positiewe
uitvoering daarvan. Hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp is die begin van 'n baie
opwindende periode in die lewe van die uitsaaiwese van die SABC.

Ek wil baie dankie sê aan almal wat voorleggings gedoen het, soos Deafsa,
Tabema, SABC, MNet, Multichoice - maar veral Cosatu wat weer eens
uitstekende werk gedoen het. Ek sluit af met 'n aanhaling van my vriend wat
sê:


  Ek is gebore op 'n ou sendingstasie, Zoar, bekend vir sy ongestreepte
  strate en min water, maar ook vir sy liefde en sy omgee vir mense.
  Grootgeword op stofstrate van die Kaapse Vlakte, geswerf van werkplek tot
  werkplek om armoede te ontduik. Ek praat Afrikaans met 'n sleng, en baie
  van my vriende praat Sotho of Xhosa. Ek is trots wanneer ek sê my hart is
  rein en oop. Ek gee om vir my medemens, waar hy of sy ookal vandaan kom
  in Moeder Afrika. Ek is trots op wanneer ek sê: Inderdaad ek is 'n
  Afrikaan. Inderdaad ek is 'n African.

Die ANC steun hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp sonder enige voorbehoud.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Fokus met Freek is another excellent and informative programme.
Submissions by Deafsa indicate that many South Africans are hard of
hearing, or even deaf. Some of them even have more than one disability and
therefore find it difficult, or even impossible, to communicate with the
world, as seen through the eyes of the broadcaster.

This amending Bill provides for the rectification of this and soon sign
language, as well as subtitles, will be seen on television.

We cannot make the mistake of playing languages off against each other or
politicising them. We must, at the same time, give equal time to all our
official languages. The present board of the SABC will play a controlling
role in this regard with programmes that will manage the public as well as
commercial broadcasting services. This structure allows for a strong focus
on the detail of the mandate and its positive implementation. This amending
Bill is the beginning of a very exciting period in the life of the
broadcasting service of the SABC.

I want to say thank you very much to everyone who made submissions, such as
Deafsa, Tabema, SABC, MNet, Multichoice - but especially Cosatu who has
once again done excellent work. I conclude with a quote from my friend,
which goes:


  Ek is gebore op 'n ou sendingstasie, Zoar, bekend vir sy ongestreepte
  strate en min water. Maar ook vir sy liefde en sy omgee vir mense.
  Grootgeword op stofstrate van die Kaapse Vlakte, geswerf van werkplek tot
  werkplek om armoede te ontduik. Ek praat Afrikaans met 'n sleng en baie
  van my vriende praat Sotho of Xhosa. Ek is trots wanneer ek sê my hart is
  rein en oop. Ek gee om vir my medemens, waar hy of sy ookal vandaan kom
  in Moeder Afrika. Ek is trots op wanneer ek sê: Inderdaad ek is 'n
  Afrikaan. Inderdaad ek is 'n African.

The ANC supports this amending Bill unconditionally.]

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Mr Chairperson, hon House, I would really
like to thank hon members for the debate that we had today and for the
support that many hon members, especially of the opposition, have given to
this Bill.

However, I would like to say to hon Dene Smuts who says that I was badly
advised ...

Ms M SMUTS: Very!

The MINISTER: ... and she says very badly advised, from higher up. I think
part of the problem is the lack of understanding of how we work, because it
is precisely the ``higher ups'' that said to me: ``Are you sure that this
is where you want to go?'' I asked them whether they were lily-livered or
not, because all hon members of this House come to me all the time,
complaining that I must exercise control and ask for this and that from the
SABC.  They said that we need more money coming from the state. They asked
about accountability, because when the SABC does not spend its money well
they do not go to the SABC but run again to me, because they do not sit in
the committees.

What this Bill has done is that it has forced South Africans. I would like
to say to the hon Vos that I also shared her joy, seeing how all of us,
whether one was on this side or the other side, wanted to defend the
freedoms. These are freedoms that the ANC has always fought for. I am glad
that - what is the word again - one puts something under the chicken-coop
and the chickens go scattering all over! [Laughter.] That is what South
Africans did and that is why we have a much better Bill that everybody has
contributed to.

I know that what we have done is to place a very difficult task on the
SABC.  Unless we did what we had done in terms of policy, accountability
and all of those things, we would have made the task of the management and
the board of the SABC extremely difficult. However, because I have
confidence in the managerial capacity for finance, policy and operations,
it gives me confidence. The road for the SABC is going to be a difficult
one, but I have never doubted that as South Africans, and as SABC
management, we will overcome and be able to deliver.

Let me refer to the issues around politically owned and public interests. I
think there is indeed something that we as South Africans sometimes have to
think about and that was raised by the hon Nat Kekana, namely the
questioning of the integrity of the Executive. In questions this Executive
should not be referred to as `your Executive'. Whether hon members like it
or not, it belongs to all of them. We are part and parcel of this
`mengelmoes'. So we all have to work together to make sure and be able, as
I say, to see where it is where we support one another, where we say that
we should not infringe upon one another's powers, but where we all do this
for the betterment of this country.

Dit is dus nie 'n kwessie van die nasionale belang is nie die staatsbelang
nie. Ek het so lank geveg dat ons nie die staatsbelang moet bevorder tot
nadeel van die mense van die land nie. Ek weet nie waarom ek vir die
staatsbelang moet staan nie, want môre, wanneer hierdie party nie so sterk
is soos wat hy nou is nie, sal ek wil terugkom en ander wette maak. Die
nasionale belang is álmal se belang; nie een mens se belang teenoor 'n
ander mens se belang nie. Dit is tyd dat Suid-Afrikaners besef ons is Suid-
Afrikaners wat'n nasionale konsensus moet hê. [Applous.] Ek wil graag baie
dankie sê aan die mense wat hierdie wetgewing gesteun het. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is therefore not a question of the national interest not being the
state interest. I have fought for so long to ensure that we do not promote
the interests of the state to the detriment of the people of the country. I
do not know why I should take a stand for the interests of the state,
because tomorrow, when this party is not as strong as it is now, I will
want to come back and pass other laws. The national interest is everyone's
interest; not the interests of one person as opposed to the interests of
another. It is time South Africans realised that we are South Africans who
must have a national consensus. [Applause.] I should like to say thank you
very much to those people who have supported this legislation. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (Democratic Party, African Christian Democratic
Party and Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging dissenting).

The House adjourned at 17:42.

     sec 75), dated 23 October 2002:


         The Portfolio Committee on Health, having considered the subject
         of the Medicines and Related Substances Amendment Bill [B 40 -
         2002] (National Assembly - sec 75), referred to it and classified
         by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section 75 Bill, reports the
         Bill with amendments [B 40A - 2002].

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional
     Development on the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill [B 55 - 2002]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 22 October 2002:
         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development,
         having considered the subject of the Judicial Matters Amendment
         Bill [B 55 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 75), referred to it
         and classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section 75
         Bill, reports the Bill with amendments [B 55A - 2002], and
         endorses the classification of the Bill as a section 75 Bill.


         The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


         1. Clause 22 of the Bill as introduced was intended to address
              problems experienced by attorneys and candidate attorneys in
              the areas of the Eastern Cape which formed part of the former
              Transkei and areas of the North West Province which formed
              part of the former Bophuthatswana. These were intended to be
              measures of an interim nature, pending the enactment of the
              Legal Practice Bill, which is intended to rationalise the
              legal profession and the legislation which regulates the legal
              profession. In the light of matters raised in the Committee
              and recent representations received on Clause 22, it would
              appear as if this Clause, while on the face of it appearing to
              be straightforward, may need further consideration and
              consultation with other role-players.


              The Department is therefore requested to consult with the
              relevant role-players on the issues at hand and to revert to
              the Committee during February 2003 with appropriate
              amendments, if necessary, that address all the issues, and
              which contain the necessary transitional arrangements.


         2. The Committee has been approached to consider inserting
              provisions in the Attorneys Act, 1979 (Act No. 53 of 1979),
              which will make it compulsory for all newly admitted attorneys
              and sole practitioners to complete a legal practice management
              course. This should go a long way towards reducing the number
              of claims against attorneys which arise as a result of a lack
              of management and/or administrative skills. While amendments
              have been prepared and made available for consideration, the
              Committee, because the deadline for the submission of draft
              legislation has expired and because of the tight legislative
              agenda for the remainder of the session, requests the
              Department to submit the amendments, which have been prepared
              by the Department and which differ from the original proposals
              submitted by the attorneys' profession in a number of
              respects, to all role-players for their comments and to revert
              to the Committee during February 2003 with firm legislative
              proposals.


         3. The Committee notes that the amendments effected to sections
              415 and 417 of the Companies Act, 1973, may also be required
              in respect of similar provisions of the Insolvency Act, 1936.
              The Committee requests the Department to consider the
              desirability of amending the Insolvency Act, 1936, in a
              similar manner, or to include them in the comprehensive review
              of insolvency legislation, and to revert to the Committee on
              the matter during February 2003.
     Report to be considered.
