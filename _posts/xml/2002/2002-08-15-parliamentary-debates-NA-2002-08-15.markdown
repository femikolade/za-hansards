Mr J P CRONIN: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next  sitting  day  of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  17 August marks the 20th Anniversary of the  murder  of  Comrade
           Ruth First, South African freedom fighter,  communist,  academic
           and journalist;


       (b)   Craig  Williamson,  a  notorious  apartheid   spy   and   agent
           provocateur, has accepted responsibility for this crime; and


       (c)   he  has  deliberately  misled  the  Truth  and   Reconciliation
           Commission about this assassination plot to protect  his  former
           superiors and collaborators;


  (2) salutes the contribution made by Comrade Ruth First in  the  struggle
       for  the  realisation  of  a  liberated,  nonracial,  nonsexist   and
       democratic South Africa; and


  (3) reaffirms its commitment to the noble principles and ideals for which
       Comrade Ruth First lived and died.
[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day  of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  with  regret  that  the  President,  who  is  accountable  and
       answerable to Parliament, will be unable to answer  Questions  on  21
       August because of obligations at  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
       Development;


  (2) observes that the dates have been known for months and  these  should
       have been co-ordinated with the parliamentary programme;


  (3) notes further that the President appeared at Question time once  this
       year, on 21 May 2002, and that if he keeps the dates in September and
       October, he will have accounted to the House only  three  times  this
       year;


  (4) regrets this disdain of Parliament; and
  (5) resolves that this is entirely inadequate if Parliament is to  fulfil
       its constitutional obligation to hold the President accountable.

[Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day  of  the
House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that five Johannesburg policemen were arrested  on  charges  of
       robbery, corruption and theft after a robbery of a cellphone shop  in
       Hillbrow;


  (2) further notes that the policemen were arrested with the assistance of
       members of the public;


  (3) condemns corruption in the SA Police Service and urges  the  relevant
       authorities  to  take  the  necessary  action  needed  to  wipe   out
       corruption; and


  (4) applauds the police and members of the public who assisted them,  for
       the swift arrest of the accused.

Ms M M RAMAKABA-LESIEA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at  the  next
sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Comrade Lilian  Ngoyi,  a  former  President  of  the  ANC
       Women's League and the Federation of South African Women, and others'
       led more than 20 000 women of all races  in  the  historic  march  in
       1956;


  (2) recognises her role in inspiring young people to  volunteer  to  defy
       unjust apartheid laws, and that she  was  a  central  figure  in  the
       women's struggle;


  (3) acknowledges that Comrade Lilian Ngoyi was  the  first  woman  to  be
       elected to the National Executive Committee of  the  ANC  and  to  be
       awarded ``isithwalandwe''


  (4) vows in this month of women's emancipation to continue  to  work  for
       the ideals that Comrade Lilian Ngoyi has fought  for  throughout  her
       life, namely -


       (a)  a society  where  all  shall  be  truly  equal  before  the  law
           irrespective of sex and gender; and


       (b)  a society where all forms of discrimination on the basis of race
           and gender, and gender inequality shall cease to exist.

[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  on  the  next
sitting day of this House:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates Professor Margaret Orr on  her  moral  victory  in  her
       fight against sexual harassment, with the  resignation  yesterday  of
       the man who made her position untenable at Unisa, former  Chairperson
       of Unisa's Council, McCaps Motimele;


  (2) notes that Professor Orr has courageously struck a blow for women  by
       refusing to be  part  of  the  conspiracy  of  silence  about  sexual
       harassment and has been completely vindicated in her actions  through
       the damages award by the courts and  the  subsequent  resignation  by
       Motimele; and


  (3) supports the decision by Unisa not to  pay  the  damages  which  were
       awarded against Motimele that are clearly his responsibility.

[Applause.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  on  behalf  of
the UDM at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) views with grave concern the revelations in the National Conventional
       Arms Report that the Government failed to disclose to the UN Register
       of Arms Sales that it had sold 28 G-5 artillery pieces to Malaysia;


  (2) considers this a serious omission that undermines  the  international
       credibility of our country and compromises its standing as key player
       in peace-keeping efforts in  the  Southern  African  region  and  the
       continent; and


  (3) regards it as an ominous dereliction of duty and lack of  good  faith
       by officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the  National
       Conventional  Arms  Control  Committee,  who  are   responsible   for
       suppressing this information.

Mrs M L NGWENYA: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting of  the
House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  policewomen manned roadblocks throughout the country during  the
           period of 6 to 9 August 2002; and


       (b)  during this period 227 people were arrested, 681  traffic  fines
           were issued, 30 stolen vehicles were recovered and  100  illegal
           immigrants were detained;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  this successful mission reflects that women can carry out  tasks
           and responsibilities which are in the interest of society  as  a
           whole; and


       (b)  the Government and the people of South Africa must  continue  to
           work towards the creation of an enabling environment  for  women
           to be equal partners in the struggle to roll back  the  frontier
           of poverty and gender inequality; and


  (3) commends the policewomen who carried out these  roadblocks  and  thus
       contributed to the fight against crime.

[Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, I intend to move at the following sitting of  the
House on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  on 7 August 2002 public hearings were held on the Education Laws
           Amendment Bill [B 31 - 2002]; and


       (b)  these hearings were  well  attended  by  teacher  unions,  SAQA,
           Independent  Schools  Association   of   SA,   the   Independent
           Examination Board and several Christian organisations;


  (2) further notes that several of  these  organisations  expressed  their
       concerns with certain proposed amendments as envisaged  by  the  said
       Amendment Bill:


       (a)  The Independent Schools Association of SA  was  concerned  about
           the possible diminishing status of independent schools and  that
           the independence granted by section 29(3)  of  the  Constitution
           could be watered down by the introduction of section 6(a) of the
           South African  Schools  Act,  which  empowers  the  Minister  of
           Education to determine  a  national  curriculum  as  well  as  a
           national process for the assessment of learner  achievement  for
           public and independent schools; and


       (b)  Section 29(3) of the Constitution allows for  the  provision  of
           education  that  is  different  from  that  provided  in  public
           schools. These differences may be of a  philosophical,  cultural
           or religious nature,  and  the  introduction  of  section  6(a),
           especially with reference to a single  national  curriculum  for
           independent schools as well, undermines the  independence  given
           to the independent educational  institutions,  as  envisaged  by
           section 29(3) of the Constitution.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with disgust that, in reaction to the tackling of  the  referee
       in the rugby test match on Saturday,  Mr  Rian  Oberholzer,  Managing
       Director of Rugby South Africa, literally added insult to injury with
       his emotional outburst against what he called  ``boorish,  boerewors-
       eating, brandy-drinking supporters'';


  (2) is of  the  opinion  that  Mr  Oberholzer  makes  himself  guilty  of
       stereotyping and generalisation, and  insulting  a  large  sector  of
       South African rugby supporters, and that the way and context in which
       he used the term ``boorish''  may,  in  tens  of  the  Equality  Act,
       constitute hate speech against a certain section of the community;


  (3) asks Mr Oberholzer to take notice that his stiff upper  lip  approach
       does not contribute to the popularisation of the game; and


  (4) is of the opinion that Mr Oberholzer has missed  the  opportunity  to
       point out that the disgusting behaviour of but one  supporter  is  an
       isolated case, and that instead he has thrown petrol on the  fire  of
       the venomous international press trying to put the whole  country  in
       the dog box because of one isolated incident.

[Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Chairperson, at the next sitting of this House I  shall  move
on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the statement by the Minister of Health that the Government  is
       seeking ``best use'' of female condoms;


  (2) further notes that female condoms are 20 times  more  expensive  than
       male condoms and that the Government is working towards ensuring that
       they are accessible to all women;


  (3) believes that the availability of quality and ``easy to use''  female
       condoms empower women to exercise their  right  to  choose  protected
       sex;


  (4) welcomes  the  announcement  made  by  the  Minister  of  Health,  Dr
       Tshabalala-Msimang, that the Government is  seeking  to  ensure  that
       female condoms are accessible to all; and


  (5) calls on -


       (a)   the  Minister  to  expedite  measures  to  make  these  condoms
           available to all, as they will also assist to curb the spread of
           communicable diseases in order to enable women to exercise their
           reproductive rights and to enjoy safe sex; and


       (b)  all men to accept and respect the right of women  to  choose  to
           use female condoms.

[Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Chair, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the extraordinary statement of the Deputy Minister  of  Foreign
       Affairs that the situation in Zimbabwe ``does not  endanger  regional
       security'';


  (2) regrets that he and the  Government  have  ignored  the  constructive
       proposals of the DA over  the  last  two  years,  including  targeted
       sanctions against Zanu-PF and using South Africa's economic  leverage
       to persuade that government  to  abandon  its  destructive  policies,
       including  antiwhite  ethnic  cleansing  and   the   destruction   of
       Zimbabwean agriculture, which has led to starvation in  the  country;
       and


  (3) calls on the Government to use all diplomatic weapons  and  to  cease
       pretending that quiet diplomacy has any further role to play in  this
       sad chapter of our region's history.

[Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chair, I give notice that on the next sitting day  of  the
House I will move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the downgrading of Brazil's debt status by Moody's  will  affect
           all emerging markets;


       (b)  as an emerging market South Africa is also experiencing the woes
           of other emerging markets; and


       (c)  the exchange rate of the rand touched  its  worst  level  in  15
           weeks; and


  (2) urges the Government and  the  South  African  Reserve  Bank  not  to
       overreact about  concerns  that  the  devaluation  of  the  rand  may
       rekindle inflation concerns and to refrain from increasing  the  repo
       rate, which would necessarily have severe consequences for the  South
       African economy and employment.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice
that at the next sitting of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the WSSD is the largest conference to be held in Africa and  the
           largest gathering of heads of state in South Africa;


       (b)  the President's inability to attend  Parliament  is  regrettable
           but understandable given the magnitude of the summit,  and  that
           an alternative date is being arranged; and


       (c)  the DP did not raise an objection when the matter was raised  in
           the Programming Committee this morning; and


  (2) calls on the DP to cease their  opportunism  and  make  a  meaningful
       contribution to this Parliament and this country.

[Applause.]

                         SANDF MEMBERS DIED IN FIRE

                             (Draft resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that three members  of  the  SA  National  Defence  Force  died
       tragically and another three were seriously injured while  attempting
       to extinguish a fire in Nylstroom;


  (2) expresses its condolences to the families of the deceased and  wishes
       the members in hospital a speedy recovery; and


  (3) acknowledges the bravery of our SANDF members who risk their lives on
       a daily basis to protect and serve South Africa and its people.

Agreed to.

         DEATH OF THE SECRETARY OF THE UNION OF AFRICAN PARLIAMENTS

                             (Draft resolution)

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  Mr  Fall,  Secretary-General  of  the  Union  of  African
       Parliaments, co-ordinator of activities of the Africa  Group  at  the
       Inter-Parliamentary Union and a Senegalese delegate of the IPU,  died
       on Friday after suffering a stroke;


  (2) and especially those  Members  who  participated  at  the  IPU,  will
       remember the energy with which he conducted  events  of  the  African
       continent and his selfless assistance to the South African delegation
       at the Morocco conference;


  (3) notes that his support for the honourable Gwen Mahlangu, a member  of
       this House, led  to  her  being  elected  as  President  of  the  Co-
       ordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians of the IPU; and


  (4) says that Africa has lost a son, South Africa has lost a dear friend.

Agreed to.
    CONGRATULATIONS TO REPUBLIC OF INDIA ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR DAY OF
                                INDEPENDENCE

                             (Draft resolution)

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) extends its congratulations to the Republic of India on the  occasion
       of that country's Day of Independence;


  (2) acknowledges the vast cultural contribution that India has made,  and
       continues to make, to the world in general  and  to  our  country  in
       particular;


  (3) acknowledges also that India is a shining example of  how  a  country
       that is multilingual, multicultural and heterogeneous may thrive  and
       obtain strength from its diversity; and


  (4) wishes the people of India a joyful day and  a  happy,  peaceful  and
       prosperous year.

Agreed to.

       EXPORT CREDIT AND FOREIGN INVESTMENTS INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF  TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,
Deputy Ministers, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, after  a  long  absence
from this House as a result of my back operation, I think it is only  proper
and appropriate that I use the first opportunity to  thank  the  members  of
this House, my friends and colleagues for all the support at the time I  was
ill. [Applause.] I thank hon members for all those chocolates,  the  flowers
and in particular the prayers. I can assure hon members that I am as fit  as
a fiddle and on my way to full recovery.

The amending Bill before us seeks to further amend  the  Export  Credit  and
Foreign Investments Insurance Act, Act 78 of 1957,  as  amended,  to  ensure
the smooth operation of the Export Credit  Insurance  Corporation  of  South
Africa Limited. This corporation was established  on  2  July  2001  as  the
official export credit agency of the Department of Trade and  Industry.  Its
role  is  to  facilitate  and  encourage  South  African  export  trade   by
underwriting bank loans and investments outside  the  country  in  order  to
enable foreign buyers to purchase capital  goods  and  services  from  South
Africa. As such the corporation fills a market  gap  in  the  provision  of,
especially, political risk cover.

In  its  first  financial  year,  the  corporation  has  undertaken  a  full
assessment of 54 applications for export credit  insurance  cover  and  five
applications for investment guarantees. It has  approved  32  export  credit
applications for projects in 28 countries and  on  five  continents  to  the
value of R7,5 billion  and  investment  guarantees  to  the  value  of  R1,2
billion. Ten export credit  insurance  applications  were  declined  in  the
process and 12 were  being  processed  at  year  end.  The  actual  policies
issued, or in the process of being issued, totalled  R3,5  billion,  whereas
investment guarantees issued totalled R1 billion.

I now come to the proposed amendments to the Act, especially to  sections  1
and 2. Although section 2 of the Act is quite clear on the  agency  role  of
the corporation, section 1 may  be  interpreted  in  such  a  way  that  the
Minister  is  required  to  approve  every  contract  of  insurance   and/or
amendment thereto. Whilst such micromanagement by  the  Minister  was  never
contemplated, insured parties are not at ease with the wording  of  the  Act
as it stands, because of  the  large  amounts  of  money  involved.  Insured
parties, particularly  international  banks  who  are  prepared  to  put  up
finance for projects at competitive rates, are concerned that they  may  not
have proper insurance cover due to a technicality  in  the  wording  of  the
Act. Section 1  has  therefore  been  reworded  to  exclude  the  Minister's
concurrence. In the process, it is proposed that the definition of  contract
of insurance be replaced with a more appropriate  definition  of  policy  of
insurance. As a consequence, section 2 also needs to be amended.

If we look at the proposed changes to section 3, hon members will see  that,
prior to the establishment of  the  corporation,  we  as  the  DTI  provided
reinsurance on contracts of insurance  pertaining  to  export  transactions.
This section deals with the percentage of the cover. The section reads  that
indemnity shall not exceed 90%  of  a  total  loss.  In  past  years,  if  a
transaction had a value of say R100, we as the DTI could indemnify,  and  in
fact we did indemnify, up to R90 of the loss. Close scrutiny by lawyers  has
revealed that a strict  interpretation  of  the  present  Act  may  allow  a
maximum indemnity of only R81. For this reason the section also  has  to  be
amended, because this was not the intention. The intention was  to  actually
provide indemnity for a full R90.

In terms of section 8 of the Act, the Minister shall appoint public  service
officers to administer this Act. We will see that this  is  a  remnant  from
the previous dispensation, when officials of the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry used to be involved in the  administration  of  reinsurance.  Today
the corporation issues insurance in terms of the Export Credit  and  Foreign
Investments Insurance Act and in terms of an agreement with the Minister  as
specified in section  2  of  the  Act.  Furthermore,  participation  by  DTI
officials is no longer necessary, because the corporation is  subject  first
to the Companies Law and has an independent board of directors appointed  by
the Minister. It is also subject to insurance law and is scrutinised by  the
Financial Services Board. Finally, it is also subject to the Public  Finance
Management Act and is a listed company.

Clause 5 of the amendment Bill therefore proposes to  repeal  the  whole  of
section 8 to take away participation by DTI officials. If we look at  clause
6, at the time of the adoption of the Export Credit and Foreign  Investments
Re-insurance Amendment Act, the corporation had  not  yet  been  established
and as hon members look at the Act they will see that we refer that  to  the
Export  Credit  Agency  and  this  has  created  some  confusion.  Clause  6
therefore proposes the substitution of Export Credit Insurance  Corporation.
We intend to make the Act retrospective to 2 July 2001. I think it  will  be
in the interest of both the corporation and its clients that the Act  has  a
retrospective effect.

Finally, all stakeholders have been consulted, but this  amendment  Bill  is
in fact a result of  an  approach  by  all  the  stakeholders  that  I  have
mentioned, including the banking industry and the IDC. So I am  hoping  that
the Bill will be supported by all, because it has come about as a result  of
problems in the operations of the corporation.

Mr N S BRUCE: Chairman, I congratulate the Deputy Minister on  her  complete
recovery of health, and welcome her back to the House. It is such a  novelty
to see Ministers in the House these days  that  we  are  especially  pleased
that she is back here. I suspect, having looked at  her,  that  she  enjoyed
the chocolates more than she did the flowers. [Laughter.]

This is a Bill that will largely  facilitate  public  servants  rather  than
politicians directly, using tax  payers'  money  in  support  of  investment
projects in Africa that  are  more  politically  convenient  than  they  are
economically viable. Far be it from my party, however, to stand between  the
Government and its mistakes. While we voted against the  nationalisation  of
this aspect of export credit provision, it would be churlish not to  support
these amendments now.

What is strange about this nationalisation of export credit  guarantees,  is
that only yesterday  five  Cabinet  Ministers  assured  the  Anglo  American
Corporation and De Beers that it was not, and  never  had  been,  Government
policy to nationalise industry or any part of it. It is  a  nationalisation,
modest  though  it  may  have  been,  which  also  flies  in  the  face   of
Government's privatisation policy.

No wonder that  for  two  consecutive  years  now  the  Minister  of  Public
Enterprises has assured this House that he is on track to sell off what  the
trade unions regard as the family silver, but he has sold nothing. The  late
Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Gerhard de Kock,  used  to  say,  ``Do  not
think because we do nothing we have not got a policy.'' The  Minister  might
like to borrow that phrase next year when, for the third  time,  he  repeats
his empty promises.

Yesterday, five Cabinet Ministers sat eyeball-to-eyeball  across  the  table
with the directors of Anglo American and De Beers  -  as  fine  a  bunch  of
upstanding young capitalist as one would find anywhere - when  the  Minister
said that nationalisation never had been and never was our  policy.  Can  we
believe them? [Interjections.] After all  the  bad  faith  involved  in  the
negotiation of the minerals Bill, and then the leaked Mining Charter,  which
could have been written by Bob Mugabe blindfolded ...  [Laughter.]  How  can
investors believe them?

According to the newspapers today, the Minister of Housing wants  the  banks
to lend our savings to customers who are unable or unwilling to  repay  what
they have borrowed. Next thing she is going  to  want  to  nationalise  them
too! Mind you, with Saki Macozoma, the hero of  South  African  Airways,  as
deputy chairman of Standard Bank, she might be  doing  some  shareholders  a
good turn. [Laughter.]

The hon  Essop  Pahad  does  not  have  to  worry  about  nationalising  the
newspapers, the Irish have done a wonderful job  for  him.  [Interjections.]
Behind all this confusion is a worthwhile desire to advance  black  business
opportunities. My party can make common  cause  with  Government  over  this
issue, as indeed it can over the need for economic growth at twice the  pace
it is now. The trouble is that Government  does  not  know  how  to  achieve
either of these objectives.

President Mbeki admitted, standing where I am now,  when  he  last  came  to
this House to answer questions, that  Government  had  no  policy  on  black
economic advancement. The outcome is contradiction,  blunder  and  inaction,
all of which create uncertainty in the minds of investors. For instance,  if
mines were nationalised, the foreign  shareholders  who  own  70%  of  Anglo
American alone, would have to be compensated. That would be another  massive
capital outflow we cannot afford.

If they were not compensated, the mining industry would soon atrophy, as  no
new investment flows in. The pensions  of  millions  would  disappear,  jobs
would evaporate, AIDS would soar. President Mbeki invited the opposition  to
put forward empowerment  ideas.  My  party  is  ready  to  do  so,  we  have
constructive ideas, which we believe will spread the wealth of this  country
among   all   the   people,   without    constricting    wealth    creation.
[Interjections.]

No matter what the Minister says to the  contrary,  investors  believe  that
growth and black economic empowerment are mutually exclusive.  There  is  no
economic argument to contradict that;  convincing  investors  otherwise  can
only be done by the  demonstration  of  ingenuity.  If  President  Mbeki  is
serious about what he said, if he is  serious  about  spreading  wealth  and
creating wealth  in  this  country,  he  may  find,  as  his  Ministers  did
yesterday,  that  consensus  in  this  matter  is  more  constructive   than
confrontation. [Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES: Mr Chairman, Mr  Bruce  was  not  present  at  the  committee
meetings when this amending Bill was discussed. [Interjections.]  I  believe
he was over in London doing constituency work.  [Interjections.]  It  is  no
real surprise that he does not understand what this Bill is actually  about.
[Interjections.] Last year, when we amended this Act for the first time,  he
expressed similar views. I think that  he  failed  to  understand  what  the
Export Credit Insurance Corporation was all about.

It is a corporation which  is  there  to  manage  long-term  political  risk
insurance on behalf of Government. This is a  form  of  insurance  which  is
quite critical to  enable  contractors  and  suppliers  to  do  business  in
neighbouring countries, but it is a form of insurance  that  is  simply  not
being provided by the private market and which  the  private  market  indeed
expects Government to provide a guarantee for.
Now I wonder whether Mr Bruce, next time when he is on a constituency  visit
to London, would care to talk, not to black empowerment firms, but to white-
owned companies such as Billiton, and ask them whether  they  would  prefer,
in the name  of  his  principles  of  the  free  market  or  whatever,  that
political risk insurance was not provided for the Mozal  project  and  other
major ongoing projects. I think we know what the answers  are.  I  think  we
know that what he said was a complete load of nonsense.

It is about establishing an agency  which  is  going  to  manage  this  very
important form of insurance.

The Bill we have before us today does not, in fact, change  any  substantial
principles in the Act which we passed last year. It is largely a product  of
debate and discussion between lawyers of various  interested  parties  about
the interpretation of certain clauses in the Act which we passed last  year,
and it is intended to give legal  certainty  in  a  context  in  which  some
lawyers believe there is ambiguity.

The underlying purpose of the amending Bill today and the  reason  why  this
Bill is being passed urgently is to allow certain arrangements with  foreign
export credit agencies to go ahead. The Deputy Minister  outlined  the  main
provisions which are being amended  in  this  Bill  to  give  greater  legal
certainty, but I must say, in the committee stage all the parties that  were
there did not have any real problems with those clauses.

There was one issue which did cause us a measure of concern and I just  want
to mention it  here.  That  was  the  provision  for  retrospectivity.  This
amending Bill, as the Deputy Minister said, is made retrospective to 2  July
2001, the date on which last year's amending Act came into force.

Like, I imagine, most  members  in  the  House,  members  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Trade and Industry have an a  priori  reluctance  to  agree  to
retrospective legislation, and we only  agreed  in  the  committee  in  this
particular  case  after  we  had  heard  from  all  the  interested  parties
concerned that they  were  unanimously  in  favour  of  it,  which  is  what
persuaded us that this was necessary.

The enactment of this Bill before the end of August will  allow  the  Export
Credit Insurance Corporation to conclude an agreement with certain  British,
Japanese and German export credit agencies which will cheapen  the  cost  of
providing cover for  phase  2  of  the  Mozal  project  in  Mozambique.  The
Industrial Development Corporation as well as  a  number  of  South  African
banks are involved in the financing of phase 2 of the Mozal project.

Mozal 1, which involved a  US  $1  billion  investment  in  Mozambique,  has
already had a major impact on the Mozambiqan  economy.  It  was  responsible
for a jump of 182,9% in  the  value  of  Mozambique's  manufacturing  output
between 1999 and 2000, and for a further 37,4%  increase  in  the  country's
manufacturing value added in 2001.

Phase 2 of the Mozal project will  double  the  output  of  the  plant  from
253 000 tons to 506 000 tons of aluminium ingots a  year.  The  construction
of this project will provide important business for South African firms  and
also exports to South  African  suppliers.  Phase  2  of  the  project  will
involve a similar investment of US $1 billion.

It is clearly, therefore, in our own interest as  an  economy,  as  well  as
that of Mozambique and the region that this  investment  goes  ahead.  Since
this Bill will  clear  a  small,  but  significant  hurdle  on  the  way  to
realising that investment, I have pleasure in commending it to the House.

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, I will not cross swords with the  hon  Professor
Davies. In fact, today we are at idem on many of the points. As far  as  the
hon Bruce  is  concerned,  I  find  his  speeches  always  amusing,  if  not
bemusing, and the member can carry on,  at  least  there  is  a  glimmer  of
laughter whenever he appears at the podium.

The Export Credit  and  Foreign  Investments  Insurance  Amendment  Bill  is
noncontroversial, and all political parties present at  the  committee  were
in agreement with these amendments.  The  amendments  basically  consist  of
name changes, technical corrections and, most importantly, they clarify  the
position that the Minister is not required to personally get  involved  with
the acceptance of the insurance policies with regard to foreign  investments
and the risk acceptance thereof.

Greater clarification about foreign risks, and  particularly  the  so-called
sovereign risk, is to be welcomed. One hundred percent of the so-called  90%
political risk is now being covered.  The  importance  of  this  legislation
will be that foreign investors can come to the table and invest directly  in
foreign projects like Mozal. The alternative would have had been that  South
Africa would have to finance these projects from foreign loans which we  had
to arrange and had access to.

The IFP and other parties were not happy with  the  retrospectivity  of  the
amendments, dating it back to 2nd July  2001.  However,  the  committee  was
assured that none of the interested parties  would  be  prejudiced  by  this
backdating and we had also been assured by those relevant bodies  which  all
attended  the  meeting.  The  committee  accepted  this  and  as  such   the
respectivity had been implemented.

The IFP will support the amendment to the Bill.

Dr R T RHODA: Chairperson, on behalf of the New National Party I would  like
to welcome the Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry  back  to  the  Chamber
after her short period of physical incapacitation, and  wish  her  a  speedy
recovery.

Chairperson, the hon Deputy Minister and the chairperson of  the  Trade  and
Industry  committee  have  already  briefly  explained  the  need  for   the
amendments. The amendments are mostly of a technical  nature  and  therefore
it will not be necessary for me to go into the finer detail thereof.

It is a pity that Mr Bruce did not take some time to  study  the  amendments
properly, then he  would  have  known  more  about  it.  The  Export  Credit
Insurance Corporation of South Africa Limited was established in July  2002.
It was established as the official export credit agency  of  the  Department
of Trade and Industry in terms of the Export Credit and Foreign  Investments
Insurance Act of 1957.

As members know, the principal objective of the ECIC is  to  facilitate  and
encourage  South  African  export  trade  by  underwriting  bank  loans  and
investments outside the  country  in  order  to  enable  foreign  buyers  to
purchase capital goods and services from the Republic.

We  have  repealed  obsolete  provisions  and  substituted  certain  gender-
insensitive words  and  expressions.  South  Africa  is  a  commodity-driven
country and amendments to  this  piece  of  legislation  will,  I  am  sure,
further boost investor confidence.  The  New  National  Party  supports  the
amending Bill.

Adv Z L MADASA: Mr Chairperson, the Bill is  really  a  technical  amendment
introduced to the House perfunctorily. It seeks to clear perceived  or  real
ambiguities that may arise from the reading of section  2  of  the  existing
Act.

It is alleged that section 2, as it stands, may be interpreted to read  that
the Minister of the Department of Trade and Industry has  to  approve  every
contract relating to policy insurance, despite the delegation of  powers  to
the ECIC. The amendment seeks to bring clarity and  allows  for  the  proper
interpretation of section 2. Other amendments are consequential hereto.

Although there is nothing contentious contained in this  amending  Bill  per
se, I would like  to  make  the  following  policy  statements.  Contingency
liabilities do increase and because of that the department is  not  absolved
from taking a vigilant stance with regard to these contingency  liabilities.
I suggest that, as far as risk management is concerned, the department  must
insure that the risk is spread through engaging other national insurers.

Since there is nothing contentious in the Bill per  se,  the  ACDP  supports
it.

Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, I want to congratulate the Deputy  Minister  on
a speedy recovery after her back operation. I want to  give  her  a  bit  of
sound advice, and that is to keep it calm. My wife had two  back  operations
and maybe the second operation was as a result of  her  getting  too  active
and busy too soon after the first one.

Globalisering het gekom om te bly. Suid-Afrika kan nie as 'n eiland  bestaan
nie,  en  moet  ten  alle  tye  'n  volwaardige  rolspeler   wees   in   die
internasionale wêreld.

Die   AEB   glo   dat   die   tegniese   regstellings    vervat    in    die
Wysigingswetsontwerp      op      Uitvoerkrediet-       en       Buitelandse
Beleggingsversekering 'n positiewe invloed sal  hê  en  sal  help  om  Suid-
Afrika  se  broodnodige  uitvoermark  te  bevorder  en  te  stimuleer.   Die
wysigingswetsontwerp is bloot tegnies van aard en is juis  daarop  gerig  om
mikrobestuur deur die agb Minister te voorkom. Ook die regstelling  om  alle
twyfel oor die maksimum persentasie skadeloosstelling uit die  weg  te  ruim
was noodsaaklik.
Die AEB gebruik hierdie geleentheid om 'n beroep op die Regering te doen  om
alle hindernisse uit die weg te ruim, asook  ondeurdagte  uitsprake  wat  'n
negatiewe uitwerking het op Suid-Afrika se uitvoeromset.

Die AEB  steun  hierdie  wetgewing.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Globalisation is here to stay. South Africa cannot exist as an island,  and
should at all times be an equal role-player in the international world.

The AEB believes that the  technical  amendments  contained  in  the  Export
Credit  and  Foreign  Investments  Insurance  Amendment  Bill  will  have  a
positive influence, and help to promote  and  stimulate  the  export  market
that South  Africa  so  desperately  needs.  The  amending  Bill  is  purely
technical in nature and for that very  reason  it  is  aimed  at  preventing
micro-management by the hon Minister.  The  amendment  that  has  as  object
removing all doubt about  the  maximum  percentage  in  indemnity  was  also
essential.
The AEB is taking this opportunity to call on  the  Government  to  do  away
with all impediments, as well  as  ill-considered  statements  that  have  a
negative impact on South Africa's export turnover.

The AEB supports this legislation.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Mr Chairperson, I thank  all  the
hon members who support this Bill and would like to say to hon  Madasa  that
we have noted his input about the spreading and sharing of risk.

I have nothing really to say about the input of hon Bruce,  because  he  had
nothing to say about the matter under discussion.  His  whole  input  was  a
waste of our time. However, just to educate him a little  bit,  let  me  say
the following. To date, South Africa's export to  Mozal  amounts  to  US  $1
billion. Secondly, without this initiative Mozal would not have  been  built
if South Africa's export finance of US $6 million was not available.

Furthermore, the  above  has  created  a  competitive  advantage  for  South
African exporters of technical goods and services that  has  resulted  in  a
permanent inflow of US $6 million US, without any outflow of the rand. So  I
am sure that if hon Bruce had attended committee meetings  and  studied  the
amendments, he would have seen how valuable these amendments are.  Technical
as they are, they have a major impact on the economy of the country  and  on
the exports of the country. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                   WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Chairperson, hon members, the event  that  all  of
us have been working so hard for over the past two years  is  now  upon  us.
The World Summit on Sustainable Development promises to be a pivotal  moment
in history in which the countries of  the  world  come  together  to  review
their progress on  sustainable  development  over  the  past  10  years  and
formulate a global plan of action as to how we all wish to work together  to
tackle the many problems relating to poverty and environmental degradation.

I recall the words of our President, President Mbeki, in Rio at the  handing
over of the torch, when he stated, and I quote:


  As my brother, President Cardoso passes on the torch -  the  flame  being
  Agenda 21 -  to  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  -  the
  Johannesburg world summit  -  the  enormity  of  the  responsibility  and
  challenge becomes tangible. We know that  he  hands  over  the  torch  on
  behalf of the victims of unsustainable development, concerned citizens of
  the world and on behalf of our children and future generations,  to  whom
  the earth really belongs.

The handing over of the torch meeting that took place in June of  this  year
saw leaders of the three countries of Sweden, Brazil and South  Africa  come
together  to  represent  the  passing  of  the  spirit   of   international,
multilateral  co-operation  on  environmental  and  sustainable  development
issues. It all started 30 years  ago  with  the  holding  of  the  Stockholm
Conference on the Human Environment and was followed 20 years later  by  the
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. It certainly is  a
proud moment in our country and continent that the torch will now be  coming
to Africa, along with the responsibility of giving the world  a  new  global
deal on sustainable development.

In order to mobilise and involve the parliamentary sector  in  Southern  and
East Africa,  Globe  Southern  Africa  has  been  running  an  earth  summit
campaign in the region over the past year.  On  13  and  14  May  2002,  the
second parliamentary conference ahead of the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development  was  held   in   Windhoek,   Namibia,   where   the   assembled
parliamentarians adopted the Windhoek Declaration. I must mention that  this
Parliament was well represented at that meeting.

UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated in a  speech  that  he  gave  to  the
London School of Economics and Politics  in  February  of  this  year  that,
``Since Rio, 66 countries have  become  poorer,  poverty  and  environmental
degradation is worsening and levels of assistance  have  decreased''.  These
concerns outline the stark reality that the global  community  needs  to  be
aware  of  going  into  the  final  negotiations  of  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development. Although the Johannesburg summit will not  be  able
to rectify all these problems in just two weeks,  it  is  important  that  a
concrete process is put in  place  that  will  fundamentally  address  these
concerns.  The  Windhoek  Declaration,  therefore,  outlines  the  following
points with regard to what Globe members would  like  to  see  come  out  of
Johannesburg.

Firstly, the  Johannesburg  summit  outcomes  must  be  action-oriented  and
focused  on  addressing  the  barriers  and  specific  needs  of  developing
countries. The global deal should create the framework for  defining  a  new
relationship  between  the  developing  countries  and  the   industrialised
countries. It must give effect to the targets in the Millennium  Declaration
and co-ordinate, deliver and monitor arrangements based on  partnerships  by
clearly  defined  institutional  arrangements.  It  must  also  ensure  that
partnerships and  initiatives  are  tangible,  result-oriented  and  include
mechanisms for monitoring progress in their implementation.

It should ensure that these outcomes support the  implementation  of  Agenda
21, as well as objectives and targets set by the international community  in
the area of sustainable development.

These statements are in unison with the  African  position  adopted  at  the
African  preparatory  conference  on  the  World   Summit   on   Sustainable
Development, which was held in October last year and which  called  for  the
Johannesburg Programme of Action  as  a  key  outcome  of  the  summit.  The
Johannesburg Programme of Action must set out the vision and  implementation
plan to strengthen policies and processes towards  sustainable  development.
It must define clear targets. This is where Rio had shortcomings.
To my mind, the challenge of the World Summit on Sustainable Development  is
to develop a common vision of sustainable development  which  all  countries
and different sectors of society can commit to, and in their  own  way  take
the vision forward. I realise that  there  is  still  some  disagreement  on
elements of the draft plan of implementation that will be negotiated at  the
summit. I feel confident,  however,  that  the  government  delegations  and
heads of state assembled in Johannesburg  will  be  able  to  resolve  these
differences and give the world a concrete plan  that  we  can  use  to  take
forward the sustainable development agenda. All of the countries have  their
own particular interests and preferred ways of addressing  the  issues,  but
it is important that  we  find  some  commonality  that  will  allow  a  new
partnership between the North and South to emerge.

On the subject of partnerships, I would like to draw hon members'  attention
to an important milestone in Africa's development, the New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development, or Nepad. This is a pledge by African  leaders,  based
on a common vision and a firm and shared conviction  that  as  leaders  they
have a pressing duty to eradicate poverty  and  to  place  their  countries,
both individually and collectively, on a  path  of  sustainable  growth  and
development and, at the same time, to  participate  actively  in  the  world
economy.

The international process leading to the summit has  been  characterised  by
intense negotiations, with moments of hope and frustration. At  many  points
in the last two years, though,  South  Africa  has  shown  itself  to  be  a
champion for sustainable  development  and  has  often  taken  the  lead  in
bringing direction and focus to the global process.  This  was  particularly
evident at PrepCom 3 in New York, where  13  of  the  largest  international
NGOs released a publication entitled Sekunjalo Ke Nako,  praising  the  work
of the South African delegation and claiming  that  their  nonpaper  on  the
global deal was a small ray of light in the process.

On 17 July this year President Thabo Mbeki convened a friends of  the  chair
meeting that was led by South  Africa's  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Dr
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma,  and  the  United  Nations  Secretary-General,  Kofi
Annan. This meeting was held as an attempt to find ways of breaking some  of
the deadlocks between countries over the most contentious  issues  contained
in the  draft  plan  of  implementation.  As  a  result  of  this  important
initiative, we can feel confident and we  can  therefore  already  hold  our
heads high in having played a leading  international  role  in  making  sure
that the World Summit on Sustainable Development is a success.

Now, as legislators we have a vital role  to  play  in  taking  forward  the
vision of the World Summit on Sustainable Development. As political  leaders
we can influence  public  opinion  and  can  increase  public  knowledge  of
relevant sustainable development agendas. As legislators we vote on Acts  of
Parliament and can ensure that the legislation protects the environment  and
quality of people's lives and advances  effective  sustainable  development.
As advocates we can mobilise the  involvement  of  Government,  the  private
sector and civil society to discharge  their  societal  responsibilities  in
responding appropriately  to  the  challenges  of  sustainable  development.
Lastly, as resources mobilisers  we  can  allocate  financial  resources  to
support and enhance effective sustainable development  programmes  that  are
consistent with sustainable development principles.

I think at this stage I must mention that all  these  good  things  that  we
have heard are as a result of a collective. As  much  as  I  never  want  to
point people out and call them by name, there are  men  and  women  in  this
Assembly today who have played a very important role.  I  think  I  have  to
start with the women,  seeing  as  we  are  celebrating  igama  lamakosikazi
[women]. Mrs Mbuyazi and Mrs Ndzanga were the two women  who  went  to  meet
with the US Congress men and women and tried to speak sense to  them  in  so
far as the Kyoto Protocol is concerned.  Some  of  those  people  are  still
praising the efforts of these two ladies. Sally Nqodi and  Mampe  Ramotsamai
represented  us  in  New  York  and  Indonesia  respectively  and  when  the
Sekunjalo Ke Nako tract was established and was sung for the  South  African
delegation, these women were actually the torch-bearers. I cannot  undermine
the efforts of one of the DP members whom I respect so much,  Janet  Semple.
In most cases I always refer to her as ``comrade'',  because  she  puts  the
nation first.

I must also mention that at the last conference  of  the  Interparliamentary
Union there were two speakers who came from this Assembly, Mr Durand and  Mr
Arendse.

Mr Arendse, I am very happy  you  are  out  of  hospital  and  to  hear  the
contributions that you have made.

He gave a speech with regard to which the University of  Cape  Town  emailed
me to say, ``Please  give  us  the  speech  that  Mr  Arendse  gave  at  the
Interparliamentary Union''.

And, of course, we have a think-tank. I always say,``Botlhogoputswa ba  itse
kwa re yang teng.'' [Elders know where we are going.] Uncle  Reg  September,
Mr Moorcroft, Prof Mbadi, and Mr Le Roux, I will always  remain  very  proud
of you.

I want to say, in conclusion, that I therefore look forward to working  with
all of you at the summit. There are over 500 side-events to  date  and  most
of them need parliamentarians to participate, so we will  be  participating.
And we will do our best. We will do what we are known for, and we are  known
for performance. We will never disappoint you. [Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Thank you, hon Chairperson. It is  always  a  pleasure  to
follow after the hon  Gwen  Mahlangu-Nkabinde,  who  is  such  an  efficient
chairperson of our portfolio committee.

The World Summit on Sustainable  Development  will  be  the  largest  United
Nations Conference ever. It is an enormously complex event,  both  in  terms
of content  and  organisation.  It  presents  a  managerial  and  logistical
challenge to this country which, if  successfully  met,  will  establish  us
firmly in the elevated ranks of those countries which have  the  ability  to
organise a  world-class  function.  But  more  importantly,  if  the  summit
succeeds, as we all hope it will, it will mark yet another step  forward  on
the long road which we all have to travel if we are to  make  this  earth  a
cleaner,  safer  and  more  pleasant  place   for   ourselves   and   future
generations.

The fact that we are  the  host  country  to  this  hugely  important  event
provides, or should have provided, South African parliamentarians  with  the
chance of a lifetime to be part of it. Unfortunately, this is not the  case.
Apart from a very select few, we as parliamentarians will have to  view  the
event from afar or, at best, from the sidelines. This is  deplorable.  Other
than the executive, the presiding  officers  of  both  Houses  and  the  our
chairpersons from the Select and Portfolio  Committees  on  Foreign  Affairs
and Environmental Affairs and Tourism, there will  be  no  participation  at
all of any other member of Parliament in the central United Nations part  of
the conference.

Representation of this Parliament at the second level, which  is  in  effect
the 2-day International Parliamentary Conference, will be restricted  to  25
members of Parliament only. For the rest,  the  remaining  members  of  this
Parliament and the NCOP, participation and observation  will  be  restricted
to the third or outer circle of fringe events. I believe that it  is  highly
unfortunate that the interests of ordinary members  of  Parliament,  all  of
whom will have an interest in some aspect or  another  of  this  conference,
have been neglected in this way.

To return to the nature of the conference itself, South Africa's slogan  for
the  summit  is,  ``People,  Planet  and  Prosperity''.  This  slogan  draws
attention to the fact that there has been a shift in  emphasis  from  purely
environmental issues to the importance of sustainable  social  and  economic
development within the context of acceptable environmental  practices.  This
concept was first articulated at the Rio Earth Summit in terms  of  the  so-
called Agenda 21. This agenda had as its aim the  creation  of  a  safe  and
just world in which all life has dignity. It worked from  the  premise  that
poverty and inequality were of the greatest threats  to  global  sustainable
development. Our slogan of ``People, Planet and Prosperity'' is therefore  a
very apt one.

One of the paradoxes of the situation in which the  world  finds  itself  is
the fact that some of the worst polluters of our  environment  are  not  the
poorest countries where  poverty  is  endemic,  but  the  richest  and  most
powerful countries. The United States of America, for example, which is  one
of the wealthiest countries on earth, is also responsible for  some  of  the
worst pollution  the  world  has  ever  seen.  This  situation  has  created
tensions which will doubtless stimulate a great number of heated debates  at
the conference.

Of special importance to the African Continent will be the issues of  peace,
security and stability. These are issues which are  basic  requirements  for
sustainable development. Wars and internecine conflicts have  hampered  many
African countries from achieving sustainable development.

Other  problems  which  have  global  application,  but  are  of  particular
relevance to Africa, are land degradation, desertification and the  loss  of
biodiversity, which follows in their wake. Of immediate  importance  is  the
effect which this land degradation and related issues have on food  security
and poverty. This continent has the capacity to  feed  itself,  but  has  in
many instances been prevented from doing so because sustainable  development
has not been pursued.

A further priority area at the summit will  be  economic  development  where
African countries will be calling for a shift  in  emphasis  away  from  aid
towards trade access with  industrialised  nations.  The  impediments  which
have been placed in the path of free trade with industrialised countries  is
a thorny issue which will also enjoy serious debate.

There are many other issues which  I  do  not  have  the  time  to  mention.
Suffice it to say in closing that a tremendous amount of work has  been  put
into this very important conference by a great  number  of  South  Africans,
all of whom are deserving of our thanks. Our  sincere  wish  is  that  their
labours will be rewarded by the best ever World Summit which  will  set  new
standards of excellence for other countries to follow.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, let me start by thanking you for  engaging  us
in this debate. In actual fact, this debate was due yesterday,  but  let  me
also thank our Chairperson who has been consistently asking  for  this  slot
so that we could have it. In fact, she  has  been  pressurising  us  in  our
debates, in our portfolio committee, that we should have  this  debate.  Now
it has happened today.

The World Summit on Sustainable Development  is  a  mystery  to  most  South
Africans. Some people say that they know nothing about the summit, some  say
that it is for those who are rich, some  know  about  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development but cannot  afford  to  be  part  of  it,  some  are
preparing themselves politically and otherwise for the summit and  some  are
already there with their exhibitions of arts and craft.

We want to thank the departments for  helping  those  people  and  even  for
going to the summit. We want to thank all the departments who have  made  it
possible for the poor people to be there. If one asks the people  what  they
think about the conference, and what will this  conference  achieve  at  the
end, they say that it is just like any other conference that  has  come  and
gone. So they do not know what is then going to happen.

If one asks them for the venue of the conference, the answer is that  it  is
``somewhere in Johannesburg'', because venues are in different places.  Some
people are saying that something is happening at Nasrec and Ubuntu  Village.
So there are so many venues. But on the whole, the summit is  a  no-go  zone
for the poor, because it is very expensive; R1 500  is  very  expensive  for
the poor.

I want to refer members to the story that was in the Cape Times on the  10th
of July. During the world summit pre-conference  meeting,  the  participants
were advised that a generous gift from the Dutch government was to be  given
to  the  Johannesburg  World  Summit   Company,   which   is   JOWSCO,   for
distribution. We are certain that it is not the wish of this  Government  to
compromise the poor people, poor civil  society,  including  the  NGOs  from
Africa  and  in  particular  from  South  Africa,  by  keeping   them   from
participating in the Civil Society Global Forum. The delegates  are  charged
an amount of R1 500. We are  appealing  to  our  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism to intervene.

What is this World Summit on Sustainable Development? It is the  development
that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of  the
future generations to  meet  their  own  needs.  Our  Chairperson  has  just
rightly said that we must preserve the earth for the future  generations  as
we found it, and we owe it to our future generations.

The IFP welcomes the theme  chosen  for  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development which will be held in Johannesburg, which is People, Planet  and
Prosperity. This theme calls for improving the quality of life  for  all  of
the world's people without increasing the use  of  natural  resources.  This
requires the integration of action in three  key  areas,  that  is  economic
growth,  conserving   natural   resources   and   environment   and   social
development.

South Africa and other developing countries have  a  unique  opportunity  to
lead the way, and we have a chance to do it right the first  time.  We  have
learnt from the mistakes of  the  developed  countries  which  have  largely
destroyed their own natural resource bases. Conservation  International  has
noted that only 17  countries  claim  two  thirds  of  the  world's  natural
resources.

The first Earth Summit, which was held  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1992  made
history in bringing global attention to the understanding that the  planet's
environmental problems were intimately linked  to  economic  conditions  and
problems of social justice. It showed that if people are poor  and  national
economies weak, the environment suffers. If the environment is  abused,  the
natural resources overconsumed, people suffer and their economies decline.

Let me examine what has been achieved  after  10  years.  Instead  of  human
beings being the centre of development in Africa as  a  whole,  their  lives
and livelihoods have become less and less unsustainable. Instead of  poverty
eradication, poverty is on the rise worldwide. This  is  happening  in  both
rich and developing countries, and both rich and  poor  countries.  Diseases
such as TB and the HIV/Aids pandemic add to the spiral of  poverty.  Instead
of restoring the integrity of the earth's ecosystem, we stand on  the  brink
of an environmental catastrophy.

Global warming is on the rise, weather patterns  are  becoming  increasingly
unpredictable, we have heavy  rains  in  winter,  and  physical  and  sexual
violence  against  women  has  become  pandemic.  Instead  of  respect   and
appreciation  of  the  knowledge  of  the   indigenous   people,   we   find
exploitation of their knowledge.

Let me now examine the  obstacles  to  sustainable  development  in  Africa.
African people and governments have  faced  formidable  obstacles  in  their
attempts to promote sustainable development in the implementation of  Agenda
21 for the following reasons. There was a lack of  financial  resources  and
of human resources, a lack of capacity to implement Agenda 21,  an  increase
in HIV/Aids, food insecurity, desertification, poverty, and so on.

Let me also touch on the air pollution. Recently in Richards Bay, there  was
a case where there was a gas leak and about  200  people  were  admitted  to
hospitals. This is very much unfortunate, because it has happened at a  time
when we are just  at  the  doorstep  of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development and some people have just been admitted to hospitals.

If we talk about sustainability, it means that  the  local  people  must  be
involved even in the setting up of plants and also in the  planning  of  any
development. Our local councillors must be part of the development plan.  We
must also challenge those who are putting in pipes to say,  if  this  breaks
what will happen to our lives? We owe it to our people to tell them what  we
have done regarding  damage  control  for  these  things.  So  we  are  also
awaiting the results of the internal investigation into  this  matter.  What
went wrong in that plant when it was then implemented? [Time expired.]

Mr E S MAGASHULE: Comrade Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members, it  is
a privilege for South  Africa  to  host  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development, which is expected to be the largest international  summit  ever
convened,  with  approximately  65  000  participants.  It  is,  indeed,   a
tremendous opportunity for this country to turn a new corner on  sustainable
development.

Indeed, the second millennium has provided humanity with  the  capital,  the
technology and  the  human  skills  to  end  poverty  and  underdevelopment.
Despite  the  substantial  increases  in  wealth   that   the   process   of
globalisation  has  generated  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  almost   half   the
population lives in poverty. There has been  no  progress  in  reducing  the
poverty  rate  and  the  number  of  people   in   poverty   has   increased
substantially since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.

It is therefore clear that the Johannesburg World  Summit's  Mission  should
simply be to reinvigorate, at  the  highest  political  levels,  the  global
commitment to sustainable development agreed upon ten years ago at  the  Rio
Earth  Summit.  There  is  a  broad  agreement  that  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development should not be about rewriting Agenda 21,  but  about
delivering on the commitments already made. There  is  a  need  for  a  very
clear programme of action to emerge from  this  summit  that  sets  concrete
targets, clear time frames, commitment to  fund  programmes  and  monitoring
mechanisms to police implementation.

Let me try to focus again on the main issues of  my  presentation,  that  is
the issue of local government. This  is  one  issue  that  directly  affects
millions of people around the world.

The round table on partnership for sustainable cities was conceptualised  to
include participation by habitat  ministers  and  mayors  from  the  African
region and other World Summit delegates from the  civil  society  and  local
government  sectors  with  a  very  clear  interest  in  sustainable   human
settlement. It will therefore be encouraging to get input from South  Africa
through the mayor of  Johannesburg,  Comrade  Amos  Masondo,  South  African
Minister Sankie Mthembu-Mahanyele  and  habitat  ministers  responsible  for
human settlement from Nigeria, Senegal and Egypt.

Agenda 21, just like the RDP document, recognises that  broad  participation
and inclusiveness are key to the success of sustainable development.  It  is
therefore highly appreciated  that  there  will  be  this  local  government
forum, centred around the unique ability  of  local  government  to  achieve
tangible improvement in global, environmental  and  sustainable  development
conditions through cumulative local action.

Since local action moves the  world,  it  is  clear  that  this  forum  will
provide opportunity for local government leaders and role-players and  their
partners from the local government dialogue paper to be part of  the  summit
and the world. The summit is relevant to  our  dream  as  envisaged  in  the
Freedom Charter - the  dream  that  there  shall  be  houses,  security  and
comfort; the dream that the slums shall be demolished and new suburbs  built
where all shall have transport, roads and lighting, playing fields,  crèches
and social centres. Sustainable urbanisation  brings  the  crucial  linkages
between cities and their environments,  at  local,  metropolitan,  regional,
national and global levels. Poverty, gender inequality and  deprivation  are
central challenges to sustainable urbanisation. No process  of  urbanisation
or development will be sustainable unless it  successfully  addresses  these
issues.

This  means  that  the  economic  and  social  dimensions  are  crucial   to
sustainable urbanisation in human settlements of all sizes.  It  means  that
the scourge of HIV/Aids, which so powerfully impacts on cities and  poverty,
must also be addressed, which is vital to  be  integrated  into  sustainable
urbanisation. The central question that  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development must answer is, therefore, what must we do and how must  we  act
in  order  to  turn  the  world  from  its  current  path  of  unsustainable
development and to act decisively to defeat  poverty  and  underdevelopment,
particularly in Africa?

Defeating poverty cannot be achieved without a fundamental restructuring  of
the economic, political and social  relations  that  define  our  world.  In
particular, it requires a massive and sustained infusion of  resources  from
the developed world to the countries of the South, particularly  in  Africa.
All this must also happen at local government level. South Africa  has  been
implementing the RDP since 1994 and the principles of the RDP  reflect  very
clearly the objectives and vision of Agenda 21. The  vision  of  integrating
social, economic and environmental  factors  into  planning,  implementation
and decision-making has been central to all programmes and policies  of  the
ANC-led Government at all levels.

The  process  of  IDPs,  which  requires   a   high   level   of   community
participation, is a critical feature of the  legislative  framework  of  our
new system of local government.  It  is  an  important  demonstration  of  a
country  committed  to  the  principles  and   objectives   of   sustainable
development. As a country at local level, we  have  managed  to  pursue  the
goal of equity and poverty eradication through the  provision  of  the  free
basic services policy;  through  economic  development  by  way  of  special
development initiatives; through  identifying  communities  that  have  been
economically  neglected;   and   through   integrated,   sustainable   rural
development programmes and urban renewal programmes.

Our system of democratic and  nonracial,  sustainable  local  government  is
barely 18 months old. Municipalities in South Africa  are  legally  mandated
to develop IDPs. The intention of  these  IDPs  is  to  realise  integrated,
sustainable and  participatory  development  planning  and  other  goals  of
Agenda 21 at a local level. These are the issues which the World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development will have to  focus  on  and  learn  from  different
experiences. It is also clear that the issue of sustainable  energy  is  one
fundamental area in which to address poverty. The urban  sustainable  energy
environment and development programmes have been working  in  South  Africa,
in particular in an area called Khayelitsha,  to  introduce  people  to  the
concept of sustainable energy-efficient homes.

I am sure we will be able to learn and  share  experiences,  but  ultimately
also resources, with  the  rich  developed  countries  and  cities.  Let  me
conclude by once more quoting from the Freedom Charter:


  There shall be peace and friendship.

We declared in 1955 that the right of all people of Africa to freedom  shall
be recognised and  shall  be  the  basis  of  close  co-operation.  This  is
becoming a reality. The dawn of the African century is a reality.

We have a destination: The World Summit on Sustainable Development.  To  get
there we need to turn our attention  towards  implementation.  Let  us  make
Johannesburg a success. Ours is a march that must unite the  broadest  range
of progressive forces in action for building  a  better  world  for  all;  a
march that  must  build  on  the  capacity  of  ordinary  people  for  self-
emancipation and unleash this potential for the benefit of all humanity.

Indeed, we are on course. Let the summit intensify the  struggle  to  secure
the social and economic upliftment of all the people everywhere in a  manner
that protects the global environment.  This  is,  after  all,  South  Africa
beyond apartheid - a non-racial, non-sexist and united democracy.

Mr J W LE ROUX: Mr  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  very  able
Chairlady, the hon Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde, for her very  kind  words.  Thank
you, Gwen.

Gedurende die laaste aantal maande het Minister Moosa, die departement,  die
beheermaatskappy en sy talle komitees alles in die stryd gewerp om  van  die
komende  beraad  'n  sukses  te  maak.  Die  toewyding  en  entoesiasme  was
oorweldigend en ons vertrou dat die wêreldberaad 'n reusesukses sal wees.

'n Beraad van hierdie omvang het natuurlik 'n invloed oor  die  hele  wêreld
en sal tot 'n groot mate  bepaal  watter  natuurlike  erfenis  ons  vir  die
nageslag laat. As gasheerland het ons die ideale geleentheid om  Suid-Afrika
te bemark as 'n land met 'n blink toekoms. Dit is 'n reklamegeleentheid  wat
net eenvoudig móét slaag.

Die 120 staatshoofde en duisende belangrike invloedryke mense  wat  nou  vir
ons gaan besoek, kan vir ons  op  die  langtermyn  uit  'n  finansiële  hoek
gesien deurslaggewend wees. Elk een van  hierdie  besoekers  moet  oorweldig
word deur ons gasvryheid  en  goeie  diens  en  moet  ons  land  verlaat  as
ambassadeurs.

Een van die hooffokuspunte  van  die  beraad  is  armoedebekamping  en  baie
debatte sal oor  omgewingsvriendelike  ontwikkeling  gevoer  word.  Daar  is
sekerlik baie redes vir armoede  in  Suid-Afrika  en  in  Afrika,  maar  die
gebrek aan beleggersvertroue is ons grootste probleem. As  ons  aan  hierdie
besoekers kan bewys dat Suid-Afrika 'n veilige hawe vir  kapitaalinvestering
is en dat die groeipotensiaal geweldig groot is, het ons in die eerste  doel
van die beraad geslaag.

Aangesien 'n derde van die afgevaardigdes reeds aangedui het dat  hulle  ook
verder in die land gaan toer, kan hierdie beraad toerisme  in  die  algemeen
bevorder. Die komende beraad bied aan ons die geleentheid om Suid-Afrika  as
'n uitstaande toeristebestemming te bemark. Toerisme dra tans minder  as  5%
van ons bruto binnelandse produk by terwyl in suksesvolle  lande  die  syfer
om en by 10% is. Dit word verder beraam  dat  die  beraad  ons  ekonomie  as
geheel met R1,6 biljoen sal  baat  en  dat  16  000  korttermyn-  en  1  600
langtermynwerksgeleenthede geskep sal word.

Die begroting vir die beraad was aanvanklik R550 miljoen. Dit lyk  egter  of
die koste om en by R630 miljoen gaan wees. Dit is noodsaaklik  dat,  wanneer
sulke groot bedrae geld gespandeer word, ons seker moet maak  dat  ons  land
die maksimum voordeel kry.

Die beraad sal fokus op belangrike sake soos water  en  sanitasie,  energie,
landbou, gesondheid en bio-diversiteit. Tydens die beraad  sal  daar  gepoog
word om langtermynooreenkomste te sluit om hierdie wêreldvraagstukke  op  te
los.

Wat die ekologiese toestand van die aarde betref, is dit so dat  die  meeste
kenners saamstem dat die afgelope 30 jaar katastrofies was en  dat,  as  ons
nie besin nie, die volgende 30 jaar sal bepaal wat die  kwaliteit  van  lewe
op die planeet gaan wees. Bewaringsorganisasies  en  wetenskaplikes  is  dit
eens  dat  ons  tans  baie  meer  verbruik  as  wat  vervang  word  en   dat
besoedelingsvlakke gevaarlike afmetings aanneem. Daar is  tans  geen  sprake
van volhoubare benutting van die meeste  belangrike  bronne  van  die  aarde
nie.  Die  vernietiging  van  natuurlike  habitat,  die   oorbenutting   van
natuurlike hulpbronne, die verspreiding  van  indringerplante  en  diere  en
veral die  vrylating  van  koolstof  in  die  atmosfeer  is  die  brandpunte
waaromheen langtermynoplossings gevind sal moet word.

Soos ons gesien het met die debat rondom HIV/Vigs, is daar botsende  teorieë
en is dit nie maklik om altyd kaf van koring te skei  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[During the last few months Minister  Moosa,  the  department,  the  control
company and its many committees have done everything possible  to  make  the
forthcoming summit a  success.  The  commitment  and  enthusiasm  have  been
overwhelming and we trust that the world summit will be a huge success.

A summit of this extent naturally has an impact  on  the  entire  world  and
will, to a large degree, determine what natural  heritage  we  leave  behind
for our descendants. As the host country we have  an  ideal  opportunity  to
market South Africa as a country with a bright future. This is  a  marketing
opportunity which simply must succeed.

Viewed from a financial perspective, the 120 heads of  state  and  thousands
of important, influential people who are now going  to  visit  us  could  be
crucial to us in the  long  term.  Every  one  of  these  visitors  must  be
overwhelmed by our hospitality and good service and must leave  our  country
as an ambassador.

One of the primary focus points of the summit  is  poverty  alleviation  and
many debates will be held on  environmentally  friendly  development.  There
are certainly many reasons for poverty in South Africa and  in  Africa,  but
the lack of investor confidence is our biggest problem. If we can  prove  to
these visitors that Africa is a safe haven for capital investment  and  that
the growth potential is enormous,  we  will  have  succeeded  in  the  first
objective of the summit.

As a third of the delegates have already indicated that they are also  going
to tour elsewhere in  the  country,  this  summit  can  promote  tourism  in
general. The forthcoming summit offers us the opportunity  to  market  South
Africa as an excellent tourist destination. Currently,  tourism  contributes
less than 5% of our gross domestic product, while  in  successful  countries
the figure is approximately 10%. It is further  estimated  that  the  summit
will benefit our economy as a whole by R1,6 billion and that 16  000  short-
term and 1 600 long-term job opportunities will be created.

The budget for the summit was originally R550 million. However,  it  appears
that the costs will amount to approximately R630 million.  It  is  essential
that when such large amounts of money are spent  we  must  ensure  that  our
country gets the maximum benefit.

The summit will  focus  on  important  issues  like  water  and  sanitation,
energy, agriculture, health and biodiversity. During the summit  an  attempt
will be made to conclude long-term agreements to solve these global issues.

As far as the ecological condition of the earth is concerned,  most  experts
agree that the past 30 years were  catastrophic  and  that,  if  we  do  not
reconsider, the next 30 years will determine what the  quality  of  life  on
the planet is going to be. Conservation organisations and  scientists  agree
that we are currently using much  more  than  is  being  replaced  and  that
pollution levels are assuming dangerous proportions. There is  currently  no
suggestion of sustainable utilisation of the  most  important  resources  on
earth. The destruction  of  the  natural  habitat,  the  overutilisation  of
natural resources, the expansion of alien vegetation  and  animals  and  the
emission of carbon into  the  atmosphere  in  particular,  are  the  burning
issues to which long-term solutions will have to be found.

As we saw with the debate around HIV/Aids, there are contradictory  theories
and it is not easy to always separate the wheat from the chaff.]

There are several controversial issues that must be  debated  and  long-term
planning is now essential. On the issue  of  carbon  dioxide  emission,  all
scientists agree that the level of pollution is far too great. This  is  not
a  problem  for  the  African  continent.  The  entire  continent  is   only
responsible for 3%  of  the  world's  carbon  emission.  Unfortunately,  the
production of electricity at  our  coal  power  plants  does  cause  serious
pollution problems.

At present the best technology by way of which  to  avoid  the  emission  of
carbon  dioxide  is  nuclear  power.  Unfortunately,  that  leaves  us  with
radioactive waste, which is an emotive issue and needs  serious  debate.  At
present solar and  wind  power  is  environmentally  friendly  but  far  too
costly. In this regard many new and innovative methods of  producing  energy
will  be  discussed.  It  is  hoped  that  in  the  near   future   exciting
breakthroughs will occur.

A second issue, on which there is virtually total scientific  agreement,  is
the question of biodiversity. At present there are more  species  identified
than ever before in the history of our  planet,  so  one  would  not  expect
biodiversity to be a problem. In actual fact, there are over 11 000  species
in grave danger of being wiped out. Many species  on  the  danger  list  are
classified as important species. The loss of  these  important  species  has
huge ripple  effects  and  some  scientists  believe  that  the  sixth  mass
extinction of life on earth is under way. [Interjections.] The way in  which
our abalone  reserve  is  being  destroyed  by  our  own  citizens  and  the
destruction of the Patagonian toothfish reserve, as well as the  red  roman,
red steenbras, poenskop and many other species, is a stark reminder  of  how
quickly extinction takes place.

Lastly, Chairperson, we do see a difference of  opinion  amongst  scientists
on whether we are in a period of global warming or whether we  are  actually
in a rather cool period. The melting of the ice caps and rising  sea  levels
do indicate that we have a huge problem and that the  greenhouse  effect  is
taking its toll. The argument against the global warming  lobby  points  out
that for the last 20 years air temperatures have been measured with  extreme
accuracy and show no warming whatsoever. Sea temperatures  of  the  Atlantic
Ocean show the same result. Actually, these temperatures have been  constant
for a  long  time.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  during  the  Viking
civilisation  Greenland  was  a  habitable  colony  with  lots  of   farming
activity, but it is now a frozen wasteland.

Speaker, the aim of the summit is  to  find  long-term  solutions  to  major
environmental and poverty-related problems. It is good news  that  two  days
have been set aside before the conference  to  reach  general  consensus  on
major outstanding issues. The summit must focus on eradicating  poverty  and
a balance must be found between  social  development,  economic  development
and the protection of the environment.

It will serve no purpose  if  the  conference  gets  embroiled  in  a  fight
between developed and underdeveloped countries and,  worse  still,  if  USA-
bashing becomes the focus of the conference. If 120 heads of  state  and  60
000  delegates  can  come  up  with  a  global  action   plan   to   achieve
environmentally sound development and as  a  result  eradicate  poverty,  we
will be satisfied and proud. I thank you.

Mnu L M MBADI:  Mgcinisihlalo,  abaphathiswa  abalapha,  ndivumeleni  ndithi
kuNkosazana uGwen Mahlangu: ``Phezulu ngabafazi, phezulu!''

HONOURABLE MEMBERS: Phezulu! [Kuyaqhwatywa.]

Mnu  L  M  MBADI:  Phantsi  ngamadoda!  [Kuyahlekwa.]  Ndiyabulela  kakhulu,
ndilusizi kuba uSekela-Mongameli engekho apha.  Ngokunye  ndimbuzile,  kanye
ngalo  mcimbi  mhla  wayebuzwa  imibuzo.   Kambe   akazange   andive,   kuba
ndandithetha isiXhosa samaXhosa. Ndandibuza okokuba ngaba  baphi  na  abantu
ngathi sithetha phezu kwabo nje.  Kambe  ke  ngomhla  wesibhozo  kwakuyo  le
imiyo uthethe nabo kule Ndlu ingasekunene kwethu  ngaphezu  kwethu.  Enkosi.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Mr L M MBADI: Chairperson, hon ministers, please allow  me  to  say  to  Ms
Gwen Mahlangu: ``Forward with women, forward!''

HON MEMBERS: Forward! [Applause.]

Mr L M MBADI: Down with men! [Laughter.] I am  grateful  however,  it  is  a
pity that the hon the Deputy President is not here. Otherwise I  asked  him,
particularly about this matter, when he was being  questioned  one  day.  He
did not understand me, because I spoke pure Xhosa. I  asked  him  where  the
people are because it seemed we are talking above their heads.  However,  on
8 August 2002 he addressed them in the House that is above us on  the  right
side. Thank you.]

The Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, in his statement  to  the
National Assembly on 8 August, created hopes and expectations in  the  minds
of both urban and rural  communities  by  listing  the  main  areas  already
agreed upon. These  are  the  eradication  of  poverty;  implementation  and
delivery of issues agreed upon; the realisation of a  balanced  emphasis  on
all three pillars of sustainable development,  namely,  social  development,
economic development and the protection  of  the  environment;  as  well  as
access to water and sanitation, energy, health, food security,  biodiversity
and ecosystem protection.
I have mentioned here but a few main areas that touch at the heart of  local
communities. Communities  in  and  around  the  conference  areas  stand  to
benefit from the spin-offs. The question may well be  asked,  what  outcomes
can the local communities in the deep  rural  areas  expect?  The  sincerest
expectation  is  the  translation  of  the  agreements  into  reality,  thus
bringing a better quality of life to all.

The main areas that could improve the life  of  local  communities  are  the
following. Firstly  there  is  Education.  It  is  promised  that  by  2015,
children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete  a  full
course of primary education.  Children  living  in  rural  areas  and  those
living in poverty, especially girls, will  have  access  to,  and  have  the
opportunity to complete, a full course  of  elementary  education,  so  that
they might acquire the basic skills necessary to enhance their wellbeing  in
the community and society.

The  conference  promises  to  meet  the  millennium  development  goal   of
promoting gender equality  and  empowerment  of  women,  eliminating  gender
disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005. If these promises  are
to have any meaning for the deep rural areas, a rethink  is  needed  on  the
condition of their schools  and  infrastructure  which  make  these  schools
accessible. It is not mean to remind this House that in some areas  learning
still takes place under trees or in dilapidated mud-brick classrooms  or  in
mud-brick rondavels of homesteads around the schools. There is no  schooling
during inclement weather. Children in  such  schools  are  hoping  that  the
World Summit will bring about an improvement in  the  conditions  that  they
have to endure.

Next we come to health and  sustainable  development.  The  Rio  Declaration
states that human beings are at  the  centre  of  concerns  for  sustainable
development and that they are entitled to a healthy and productive  life  in
harmony  with  nature.  The  goals  of  sustainable  development  cannot  be
achieved when rural  hospitals  have  no  doctors  and  both  hospitals  and
clinics have no medicine. There is a shortage of nurses  in  both  hospitals
and clinics and very little is being done  to  improve  the  situation.  The
House is aware of the condition of  hospitals  in  some  provinces.  Special
programmes to assist children orphaned by HIV/Aids and  other  diseases  are
not yet in place in many rural areas.

Poverty eradication is another area.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr L M MBADI: Ndilusizi kakhulu, mhlekazi, kuba  bendisenomcimbi  ebendifuna
ukuwubeka apha eNdlwini. [It is just a pity because I have an issue  that  I
wanted to put forward to this House.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, the critical issue facing us as  parliamentarians
will be monitoring the implementation of the final  agreement  arising  from
the summit. The Interparliamentary Union will meet during this  summit,  and
focus on  the  role  of  parliamentarians  in  ensuring  implementation  and
accountability  with  particular  reference  to  compliance  with  reporting
requirements. This will go a long way  to  ensure  that  the  implementation
problems following the 1992 Rio agreement are not repeated. We are proud  as
a portfolio committee that the hon Gwen Mahlangu serves on the executive  of
the IPU, and will undoubtedly make a valuable input at its meeting.

It must also be  recorded  that  we  do  not  agree  with  all  the  aspects
contained in  the  chairman's  text  for  negotiations,  particularly  those
related to reproductive health care. We will however, positively  contribute
to the debates surrounding the implementation  plans  in  the  six  priority
areas of health, education, water and sanitation, energy, food security  and
technology.

Poverty alleviation is clearly a main thrust of the  conference,  and  quite
rightly  so.  Recently  various  organisations   including   the   WHO,   UN
Development Programme, the World Bank and Oxfam calculated  the  total  cost
of implementing millennium development goals which are aimed  to  halve  the
world's poverty by 2015. The lowest quote came in at US$50 billion  and  the
highest at US $100 billion per year.
The question can also be posed as to what  role  religious  communities  and
churches can play at the summit. Whilst churches continue to play a  pivotal
role in poverty alleviation worldwide, they can also contribute  theological
and moral substance to discussions at the summit.

Biblical stewardship holds that we are trustees and keepers of creation.  We
need to understand that we are wielders of  extraordinary  cumulative  power
that can affect all of life in fundamental and unprecedented  ways.  We  now
possess the  knowledge  to  build  and  destroy  on  a  massive  scale.  Our
knowledge is  outstripped  only  by  our  ignorance  and  its  dangers.  The
steward's  moral  quest,  then,  is  for  a  just  and  sustaining  use   of
unprecedented knowledge and power. It is apposite,  therefore,  to  conclude
with the Creation Care Prayer which churches are encouraged to  use  on  the
eve of the summit, on Sunday 25 August 2002.

The Creation Care Prayer is as follows: C - creating God, you have given  us
a vision of a new heaven and a new earth;  R  -  resources  conserved;  E  -
earth tended; A - atmosphere cleansed; T -  trees  planted;  I  -  injustice
ended; O - oceans teeming; N - nations at  peace;  C  -  creator;  redeemer,
sustainer. A - alert nations, enthuse churches; R - receive  our  commitment
and so entwine our lives with Your purposes; that E - earth and heaven  will
then sing of Your glory. Amen. [Applause.]

Ms B P  SONJICA:  Chairperson,  as  we  celebrate  this  month  as  a  month
dedicated to women, I wish to take this opportunity to pay  tribute  to  all
women, especially those who were at the  forefront  fighting  alongside  our
male comrades for the liberation of the oppressed in our country.

My input is drawn from South Africa's position paper  on  Water,  Sanitation
and Forestry, for the WSSD, which was presented recently by  Comrade  Ronnie
Kasrils at a water symposium in Stockholm. Of course, I  will  elaborate  on
the elements that I have chosen.

The South African Constitution, section 27(1)(b),  declares  water  services
as a basic right, making  it  obligatory  for  the  Government  to  make  it
available to all its citizens for social and  developmental  usage.  Comrade
Kasrils captures this very well when he says:


  Water is life. The amount and nature of the  available  water  determines
  the extent and nature of that  life.  The  amount  and  nature  of  water
  available also determines where development can take  place.  It  is  the
  task  of  a  government  to  care  for  this  water,  to  seek  its  fair
  distribution, balance the competing usage and to facilitate its wise  use
  for, amongst other things, social and economic  development.  Development
  is crucial to ensure that we can eradicate the scourge  of  poverty  that
  stalks our planet.

This statement is relevant for all governments,  but  most  importantly  for
governments of the developing world, which is characterised  by  famine  and
underdevelopment. As all hon members know,  South  Africa  is  also  one  of
those countries.

Apartheid South Africa was characterised by social injustice,  reflected  in
inequality in all sectors of our society,  including  the  water  sector,  a
situation which the democratic Government had to redress. The Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry was established to carry out that task.  It  came
up with the Water and the Water Services Acts respectively, to  bring  about
social justice in this area.

The position to be  presented  is  based  on  the  background  I  have  just
outlined. The following are some of the issues that South Africa will  raise
at the summit: One, the commitment of governments and  international  bodies
to ensuring that water services are accessible  to  all;  two,  setting  and
meeting  of   the   targets;   three,   people   participation,   especially
participation by women; four, the programme of action beyond Johannesburg.

On the first point of  governments'  commitment  to  making  water  services
accessible  to  all  citizens,  South  Africa's  democratic  Government  can
proudly say that it has made strides in trying to  breach  the  gap  between
the people who did not have access to water services and those who had, pre-
1994. There is no doubting its commitment, which is reflected  in  both  its
policies and the budget allocation that has been increasing over time.

Siyazi ukuba abantu  abazizigidi  ezisixhenxe  abakawafumani  amanzi,  kanti
abazizigidi  ezilishumi  elinesibhozo  abakabonelelwa  ngeenkonzo  zogutyulo
lwelindle. La manani abandakanya  naba  bantu  lihamba  lisima  nabo  ilungu
elihloniphekileyo, iNkokeli yeQela eliPhikisayo, ukuze livele  kumabonakude,
lisenza ngathi liza kubalungiselela  kwiingxaki  zabo.  Hayi,  siyazi  ukuba
yipolitiki nje yakhe leyo. Eneneni, ziinkqubo zikaRhulumente ezi  azibangayo
esele ziqhubeka ukuzama ukutshintsha imeko yeendawo ezinamanzi amdaka.

Ndibhekisa  kwezaa  nkqubo  zohlaziyo  lwemimandla  yeedolophu   kwaneNkqubo
Manyanisiveyo yoPhuhliso lwaMaphandle. Kaloku  kukho  imali  ayibeke  bucala
uRhulumente  ukuze  kulungiswe  ezi  meko.  Ntonje  uphuhliso  asinto  uvuka
seyenzekile ngathi ngumsebenzi wobugqi; yinto ethabatha ixesha, ngakumbi  xa
ubani  ezimisele  ukwenza  into   eyiyo   engenzi   nje,   esenzela   abantu
abaxabisileyo.

Kukho umkhuba  othile  obonakalayo  phakathi  kwamaqela  ezopolitiko  wokuba
iimbono   neenkqubo   zikaRhulumente   azenze   ezawo.   Kaloku    izitshixo
zikuRhulumente kwaye uRhulumente wazinikwa ngabantu beli lizwe  ngalaa  voti
yamisela uRhulumente  wesininzi.  Zonke  ezi  zinto  zenzeka  ngenxa  yokuba
uRhulumente okhokelwa yi-ANC uzimisele ukufezekisa laa  minqweno  yayilwelwa
yi-ANC, yokuphucula impilo yabantu bonke kungakhethwanga bala.  (Translation
of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[We know that 7 million people still do not have access to water,  and  that
18 million have not been provided with sanitation  services.  These  figures
include the people that the hon the Leader of the  Opposition  has  appeared
with on TV, pretending that he is going to help  solve  their  problems.  We
know  that  he  is  just  playing  politics.  Indeed,  it  is  the  existing
Government policies that attempt to turn  around  the  situation  in  places
with no clean water that he is claiming as his.
I am referring here to the urban renewal projects and the  Integrated  Rural
Development Strategy. Money has  been  set  aside  by  Government  for  this
purpose. However, development does not happen overnight -  abracadabra;  and
there it is. It  takes  time,  particularly  when  one  intends  to  develop
something worthwhile for the people one holds dear.

There is  a  tendency  among  opposition  parties  to  claim  as  their  own
Government views and policies. The keys are with  the  Government  and  were
given to it by the people of this country during the election that  put  the
majority Government in power. All these things have become possible  because
the ANC-led Government aims to fulfil the rights that the  ANC  fought  for,
such as improving the health of all the people irrespective of colour.]

We also need the commitment of the developed world and  other  international
bodies to direct donor funds towards  ensuring  service  to  the  7  million
people in South Africa that do not have access to clean water  and  the  1,1
billion people who do  not  have  water  in  the  whole  world.  I  am  also
referring to the 18 million people without sanitation, as well  as  the  2,4
billion people who do not have access to adequate sanitation in  the  world.
That should  be  redressed.  We  cannot  begin  to  talk  about  sustainable
development if the conditions under which the very people, who  are  key  to
development live, are not improved.

The second issue that South  Africa  will  endorse  is  the  setting  up  of
targets for halving the backlog in the water supply that I have  alluded  to
by 2015. We are also calling for a  similar  target  for  the  provision  of
sanitation to  halve  the  number  of  people  without  access  to  adequate
sanitation by 2015.

South  Africa  and  Africa  are  already  gearing  themselves  towards  this
achievement as evidenced by the  African  Sanitation  Conference  and  South
Africa's sanitation workshop, which was held recently in Johannesburg.

South Africa is also supporting the  international  Wash  programme  of  the
Water Service and  Sanitation  Collaborative  Council,  which  is  based  in
Geneva. The campaign promotes a comprehensive approach to  sanitation,  that
sanitation is not only about toilets, but  also  about  water  and  hygiene,
especially if we are  aiming  at  combating  the  water-borne  diseases  and
improving the health of our people,  especially  the  health  of  women  and
children.

Water is life. It  is,  therefore,  imperative  that  all  governments  work
towards ensuring that fresh water  is  available  forever.  So  we  need  to
conserve and protect this commodity. The Department  of  Water  Affairs  has
just  released  its  National  Water  Resource  Management  Strategy,  which
establishes  mechanisms  for  water   management   in   our   country.   The
establishment of catchment management agencies dealing with leakages is  one
of the areas referred to in this strategy.

However, the best way we can manage the resources is to empower people  with
information. Of utmost importance is the involvement of women  in  strategic
positions within the sector. Sadly, at this point in South Africa  they  are
grossly underrepresented.  We  believe  that  by  bringing  women  into  the
mainstream we would be bringing  in  efficiency,  equality,  accountability,
transparency and clean governance.

It is also important for the developed world to assist the developing  world
to redress the infrastructure  backlog.  However,  the  infrastructure  that
will be put in place must be able to provide a  sustainable  service.  There
is a move towards the abolition of the construction of dams, which is  based
on the fact that contractors that have been involved in the construction  of
dams have been accused of corruption.

We are saying that rather than  putting  a  blanket  approach  on  this,  we
should address the problem of corruption because such an approach says  that
the  developing  world  must  look  into  options  that  will  not   provide
sustainable services.

The global target of aid, which is 0,7% of GDP in developed  countries,  has
not been reached and in some countries levels  have  been  reduced.  We  are
calling on the developed world to meet its target and  also  to  enter  into
agreements  with  developing  countries  rather  than  loose   partnerships,
because we believe that this will minimise corruption.

Lastly, we call on all South Africans to go there  with  a  united,  proudly
South African voice and  put  South  Africa  on  top  of  the  international
agenda. The most important call that we will make  is  that  a  strategy  to
implement the Johannesburg Resolution should be established and  implemented
and we  are  confident  that  South  Africa  will  lead  by  example.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, if we look around us in  South  Africa  and
in Africa, we see that we are in trouble; in  trouble  because  development,
as we know it, is not solving the problems of the poor. The old  development
definitions and methods are not solving the problems of the poor  -  not  in
South Africa, Africa or in the rest of the world.

Why? Because the industrial economy, as we know it, is not sustainable.  The
destruction of our  basic  resources,  for  example,  land,  water  and  the
atmosphere, is the critical point. It is calculated that if everyone in  the
world tried to reach the  development  level  of  the  average  middle-class
American today, then we would need five more Earths. We  do  not  have  five
more Earths. We only have this one, and the resources of this Earth.

Dit het ingrypende implikasies as ons aanvaar dat die  industriële  ekonomie
soos ons dit ken, nie  volhoubaar  is  nie.  Vernietiging  van  ons  basiese
hulpbronne, naamlik grond, water en die atmosfeer  het  dus  'n  akute  punt
bereik. Steeds poog lande nie om die proses om te keer nie,  maar  slegs  om
dit  te  stabiliseer.  In  Amerika  se  geval  sien  hulle  nie   kans   vir
stabilisering nie, maar hulle vereis steeds meer hulpbronne.

Die eenvoudige probleem is dat te veel van die aarde  as  beperkte  hulpbron
verwag word. Die armes vereis te veel van die aarde,  omdat  hulle  nie  oor
die middele beskik om iets anders te doen as om roofbou toe te pas nie.  Die
rykes vereis te veel van die aarde omdat  hulle  begeertes  geen  einde  ken
nie.  Ek  herhaal:  Daar  word  bereken  dat  as   elke   wêreldbewoner   'n
lewenstandaard  handhaaf  wat  gelyk  staan  aan  dié  van  'n   middelklas-
Amerikaner, sal ons die hulpbronne van nog vyf  aardes  nodig  hê.  Wat  nou
gemaak?

Die  antwoord  lê  dus  nie  net  in  bevolkingsbeperking   nie,   maar   in
begeertebeperking. Of anders gestel: As die mens as organisme wil bly  leef,
moet hy homself as 'n element van die ekologie sien, as deel van die  natuur
en hom so probeer gedra.

Globalisering hou baie voordele vir ons  in,  maar  globalisering  word  ook
deur baie gesien as  'n  proses  wat  die  rykes  bevoordeel  en  die  armes
benadeel. Ons moet 'n balans hier  vind.  Hopelik  sal  die  komende  beraad
daarin slaag om hierdie balans te vind. Globalisering het daartoe gelei  dat
daar nuwe waardering vir die plaaslike,  die  eie,  die  besondere  is.  Die
moderne mens is ``global and local''.  In  Amerika  trek  die  mens  na  die
platteland waar hy rustig dan met sy rekenaar aan  die  globale  wêreld  kan
deelneem, terwyl hy die voordele het  van  'n  klein  gemeenskap  waarin  hy
lewe.

Die VF glo dat die ontwikkeling en die  antwoord  vir  die  ontwikkeling  in
Suid-Afrika en Afrika in  'n  gemeenskapsbenadering  lê.  Afrikagemeenskappe
moet daarvan vergeet dat die regering, die Weste, of wie ookal,  hulle  gaan
red. Ons moet begin werk aan selfstandige gemeenskappe. Dit beteken  dat  'n
gemeenskap homself verbind om tot 'n baie groot mate  sy  eie  behoeftes  te
bevredig. Dit geld ook vir  Afrikaners  wat  tans  rondworstel  op  soek  na
oplossings vir hulle groterwordende probleme van armoede en ontmagtiging.

Die Britse ekonoom Schumacher het in sy werk Small is  Beautiful,  Economics
as if People Mattered opgemerk dat ons uiteindelik daarvoor  moet  hoop  dat
ons liewers 'n miljoen klein ``villages'' wêreldwyd sal hê, as enkele  groot
megapolisse. Kom ons hoop  hierdie  benadering  geld  by  die  beraad.  [Tyd
verstreke.] [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This has  far-reaching  implications  if  we  accept  that  the  industrial
economy as we know it is not  sustainable.  The  destruction  of  our  basic
resources, namely the soil, water and the atmosphere, has indeed reached  an
acute point. Still some countries do not attempt to curb  the  process,  but
merely to stabilise it. In the case of America they do  not  see  their  way
clear to stabilisation, but yet they continually demand more resources.

The problem is simply that too much is expected of the earth  as  a  limited
resource. The poor demand too much of the earth because  they  do  not  have
the means to do anything other than overcropping. The rich demand  too  much
of the earth  because  their  demands  know  no  limits.  I  repeat:  It  is
estimated that if every citizen  of  the  world  maintained  a  standard  of
living similar to that  of  a  middle-class  American,  we  would  need  the
resources of another five earths. What must be done?

The answer therefore does not lie only in limiting the  population,  but  in
limiting our desires. Or, put otherwise, if man  wants  to  live  on  as  an
organism, he should see himself as an element of the ecology and as part  of
nature, and try to behave accordingly.

Globalisation has many advantages for us, but is also  seen  by  many  as  a
process which favours the rich, to the detriment of the  poor.  We  need  to
find a balance here. Hopefully the coming summit will manage to find such  a
balance. Globalisation has led to a new appreciation of the local, the  own,
the unique. Modern man is both global and  local.  In  America,  people  are
moving to the rural areas, where they can quietly participate in the  global
world with their computers, whilst still  enjoying  the  advantages  of  the
small community in which they are living.

The FF believes that development and the  answer  to  development  in  South
Africa and Africa as a whole lie in a communal approach.  African  societies
should not rely on their government, the West, or whoever, to  rescue  them.
We should start working towards self-sufficient  communities.  This  implies
that a community should, to a very great extent, commit  itself  to  meeting
its  own  needs.  This  also  applies  to  Afrikaners  who  are  at  present
struggling to find solutions for their ever-increasing problems  of  poverty
and disempowerment.

The British economist Schumacher remarked in his work  Small  is  Beautiful,
Economics as if People Mattered that we should hope that  we  would  end  up
with millions of small villages worldwide,  rather  than  with  a  few  very
large metropolises. Let us hope that  this  will  be  the  approach  at  the
summit. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Mr Chairperson, the moment that we  have  been  waiting
for  in  South  Africa  has  arrived:  Thousands  of  foreign  visitors  are
descending  on  our  shores  to  attend  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development.

What is significant about this event in our country? Firstly, the summit  is
expected to propose and commit to a programme of action aimed at  addressing
sustainable development goals. It is at this gathering that  the  summit  is
expected to find practical solutions on how  to  better  the  lives  of  the
world's poor countries.

It is appropriate that  the  United  Nations  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development is taking place in the rich Sandton suburb a stone's throw  away
from Alexandra, one of South Africa's oldest  and  poorest  townships.  This
opulent  meeting  place  will  provide  international  decision-makers   and
visitors  with  a  first-hand  experience  of  what  we   mean   by   uneven
development. It will capture, succinctly, what is meant when  we  say  there
are two worlds in one country.  When  we  compare  and  contrast  Alexandra,
Gugulethu, Soweto and many other townships in  South  Africa  with  Sandton,
Constantia and Waterkloof, we find  answers  as  to  what  damage  apartheid
policies in South Africa have done to the majority of this country in  terms
of unequal living standards.

It is not by coincidence that the summit's agenda  mirrors  the  development
and transformation challenges faced by our country.  These  challenges  are:
access to clean running  water,  affordable  energy  and  technology,  waste
management, access to healthcare, food security and poverty eradication.

The reality is that issues of sustainable  development  are  not  about  the
environment only, but should be inclusive of broader issues  addressing  the
poverty  that  is   deeply   entrenched   in   our   communities   and   the
underdevelopment of poor countries. The  question  of  trade  relations  and
debt management or cancellation should be at the centre of the discussion.

Secondly, we need to take pride in the fact  that  our  country  will  be  a
subject of international and national focus. The immediate benefits  of  the
summit  are  being  felt  at  the  economic  level  -  direct  and  indirect
employment opportunities have been created, which is good for our economy.

This is an opportunity to take advantage and to  showcase  South  Africa  to
the world and deal with the negative perceptions about this  country.  South
Africa has a lot to offer the world. Let us  share  with  our  visitors  our
experiences as to how we have managed to reach where we are  democratically,
despite ... [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Mr Chairperson, global summits can be helpful  and  effective
only if the majority of the world participates.

The World Summit on Racism held in Durban  was  unfortunately  boycotted  by
some countries  which,  ironically,  needed  the  summit  most.  After  that
summit, the world witnessed dark clouds  gathering  when  the  September  11
episode shook the world, and nearly brought all of us  to  the  brink  of  a
cataclysmic end. One might even say that  the  Israeli-Palestinian  problem,
which has the same elements of world tragedy, could have  been  resolved  at
the Durban summit.

The Earth Summit, taken seriously, could impact on the whole world and  help
to make our planet a better and safer place for our children and  posterity.
In order to realise this ideal we should have  adequate  funding.  It  is  a
pity that the rich countries of the world have not been  magnanimous  enough
to contribute to the success of the summit.

One of the main emphases of the summit is  poverty.  The  number  of  people
going to bed with  empty  and  rumbling  stomachs  is  increasing.  Our  own
country, which is hosting this summit, and our neighbouring  SADC  countries
are no  exceptions.  We  hope  that  the  glittering  lights  of  Gauteng  -
literally meaning `place of gold' - will not  blind  the  delegates  to  the
groans of the poor.

It is a pity that the sophisticated infrastructure required to host a  world
indaba of this size can only be found in places such as Sandton.  The  ideal
place for hosting this type of conference would  have  been  Sekhukhuneland,
Vendaland, Ciskei, Transkei, Zululand, etc. It is hoped that  the  needs  of
the poor will not be forgotten, and that the poor  and  unemployed  will  be
given some slices of the cake that the windfall of the summit will bring.

The other focus of the summit is on a cleaner and more  secure  environment.
The  concerns  for  clean  water  and  sanitation  should  not  be  ignored.
Industrial pollution and pollution caused by poverty should  be  reduced  or
contained. It is hoped that no strikes or  demonstrations  will  be  planned
for the duration of the summit, particularly if they are aimed  at  throwing
rubbish in the streets.

I might add  that  although  the  democratic  rights  of  citizens  bringing
forward the concerns and the plight of the poor, jobless  and  the  landless
must be respected, any  attempt  to  disrupt  the  summit  must  be  roundly
condemned.

The PAC has supported the summit for months, and we will continue to do  so.
We therefore wish the summit every success, and  hope  that  it  will  bring
changes to our country, our continent and our planet.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH:  Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members,  as  with  other
ministries, I am proud to report that my ministry has played  a  significant
and central role  in  the  build-up  to  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development. At the Rio Summit, health was seen as being at  the  centre  of
sustainable development. Ten years after the  Rio  Summit  health  is  still
seen as one the most important priorities in sustainable development.

This is a concept that I hold dear, because we  cannot  achieve  sustainable
development if the health problems of the world, and in particular those  of
the developing world, are not addressed. Because of  this,  I  have  ensured
that health plays a pivotal role in the  summit.  In  January  this  year  I
hosted a meeting supported by  the  WHO,  the  SADC  health  ministers,  and
representatives of E9 countries. At this meeting we explored in  detail  the
relationship between health and sustainable  development  and  emerged  with
what is now internationally known as the Johannesburg Declaration on  Health
and Sustainable Development.

The US, having participated at this meeting in Johannesburg, did not  pledge
itself in support of the Johannesburg Declaration. This was  later  to  have
an influence on the positions to be taken by the US both in  Geneva  and  in
the subsequent international forums. In this  declaration  we  recalled  the
first principle of the Rio Declaration, which proclaimed that  human  beings
are at  the  centre  of  concerns  for  sustainable  development.  They  are
entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature.

We note with concern the reality that despite  much  progress  health  today
and into the future continues to be severely compromised,  with  sub-Saharan
Africa carrying the greatest  burden  of  disease.  In  our  declaration  we
called for  reaffirmation  of  the  millennium  development  targets  and  a
commitment from the international community to scaling  up  its  efforts  in
health to the level required to make the desired impact on disease.

The declaration, which I  will  make  available  to  Parliament,  offers  an
understanding of  the  inextricable  link  between  health  and  sustainable
development, calls for scaled-up interventions to impact  on  the  countries
most burdened with  disease,  and  identifies  specific  actions  needed  to
address the poverty, globalisation, environmental  and  health  systems  and
causes of ill health.

The Johannesburg Declaration  formed  the  basis  of  a  resolution  that  I
presented to the assembly of the WHO in  May  this  year.  This  declaration
formed the foundation of a resolution  that  was  adopted  by  World  Health
Assembly. This means that  health  ministers  around  the  globe  share  our
concerns and recognise that improved health drives sustainable  development,
and that urgent action is required to  reduce  the  unacceptable  levels  of
unnecessary suffering and death.

This concern is shared by the Secretary-General of the UN,  Mr  Kofi  Annan,
who  has  placed  health  amongst  the  top  five  issues  for   sustainable
development. We have also seen the Health Chapter of the base  document  for
the Summit, known as the  Chairman's  Text,  grow  in  clarity  and  content
through the various preparatory committees,  culminating  in  the  situation
where health was the most agreed upon  chapter  at  PrepCom  4  in  Bali,  a
chapter that drew heavily on our Johannesburg Declaration.

It must be noted that  the  preparatory  work  and  negotiations  have  paid
dividends. This was evidenced by the fact that when the Health  Chapter  was
adopted  with  only  a  few  instances  of  so-called  bracketed  text,  the
delegations at the PrepCom 4 spontaneously broke  into  applause.  The  only
outstanding area is around the Doha Trips Agreement on access to  affordable
medicines. This is an area in which we cannot afford to  compromise  and  we
will continue fighting to ensure  that  the  world's  poor  have  access  to
affordable medicines.

Whilst we  would  have  preferred  tighter  time  frames  and  more  binding
language,  I  am  nevertheless  pleased   that   the   Health   Chapter   is
comprehensive. It deals,  amongst  other  things,  with;  unacceptably  high
levels of poverty, and  the  need  therefore  for  programmes  to  eradicate
poverty  and  starvation  and  to  ensure  development;  strengthening   the
capacity of health care systems to deliver basic health services to  all  in
an efficient, accessible and affordable manner;  improving  the  development
of human resources in the health  care  services;  a  programme  to  achieve
health literacy globally; reduction  of  mortality  rates  for  infants  and
children and maternal mortality rates;  promoting  the  use  of  traditional
medicine and protection of traditional knowledge; sharing  access  of  women
to health  care  services  including  reproductive  health  care;  accessing
environmental  threats  to  human  health;  technologies  for  safe   water,
sanitation,  and  waste  management;   strengthening   occupational   health
programmes; promoting health by  ensuring  access  for  all  to  sufficient;
safe, culturally accepted and nutritionally  adequate  food;  combating  HIV
and Aids; implementing national preventive and treatment strategies for  HIV
and Aids; ensuring adequate funds for the global fund to fight Aids, TB  and
malaria; mobilising funds for research and development and ensuring that  it
is directed towards relevant research; reducing health  problems  associated
with  air  pollution  and  other  health  problems   associated   with   the
environment;  and  addressing  non-communicable  health  problems  such   as
cancer, hypertension and diseases of lifestyles.
It is quite a comprehensive Health Chapter and it is something that  we  can
build on and strengthen during the next 10 years. The  key  tenets  of  this
declaration are completely in line with Nepad, which is our  guiding  socio-
economic  political  framework  for  making  a  visible  impact  in  health,
sustainable development and poverty alleviation in the  region  and  on  the
African continent.

Eight years after the first democratic elections in our country  we  are  at
the verge of totally eliminating polio in South Africa, and we  are  working
towards certifying  the  whole  of  the  SADC  region  polio-free  by  2005.
Immunisation coverage among children has improved substantially and  measles
is no longer a serious threat to child survival in South Africa.

In 1996 there were 10 567 cases of measles and 24 deaths. In 2000 this  came
down to 1 593 cases and no deaths. As part of our  international  solidarity
work, we signed a co-operation agreement with Angola to assist them  in  the
training of their health personnel and  to  be  their  referral  centre  for
polio diagnosis. In  July  2002  we  signed  an  agreement  with  Italy  for
collaboration  in  health  research  and  strengthening  health  policy  and
planning at national level.

I am also pleased to report to Parliament  that  I  will,  in  collaboration
with WHO, be hosting a parallel event  at  the  Ubuntu  village  during  the
summit. Among others Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Director-General  of  the
WHO and Ms Carol Bellamy, the Executive Director of Unicef will be  the  key
speakers during this event.  The  meeting  will  explore  the  evidence  and
action for investing in health and in  particular  children's  environmental
health.  We  will  carefully  consider  pragmatic  examples  of  health  and
sustainable  development  and  the  potential  for  partnerships  in  health
research for development.

One cannot consider health and sustainable development without  focusing  on
the very real tragedy unfolding right now on  our  sub-continent,  which  is
famine. The health parallel event will  begin  with  the  ministers'  round-
table which I will be convening entitled, ``Pushing back  the  frontiers  of
poverty to address the issues of poverty and  nutrition.''  Colleagues  from
SADC  countries  will  present  an  analysis  of  the  situation  and  offer
intersectoral proposals for addressing the immediate  challenge  of  hunger,
and for putting in place sustainable solutions so  that  future  generations
do not suffer from the scourge of malnutrition.

As health ministers we will be advocating  that  this  must  remain  a  very
central purpose of the summit. I believe that if, at the  very  least,  this
is one thing that we achieve, a combined call and action that  ensures  that
no person shall suffer hunger, then the summit will be a success.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the  WHO  and  my  fellow  SADC  health
ministers  for  the  support  they  have  provided  and  the   Minister   of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism for the effectiveness of the lead role  he
and  his  department  have  played  in  the  preparations  for  the  summit.
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, 'n groot eer het Suid-Afrika te  beurt  geval
om  gasheer  te  wees  van   die   komende   Wêreldberaad   oor   Volhoubare
Ontwikkeling. Die AEB is maar te deeglik bewus van die reusetaak wat op  die
organiseerders en die duisende rolspelers en vrywilligers  rus  om  van  die
beraad 'n sukses te maak.

Ons wil Minister Moosa en sy span  alle  sterkte  toewens  en  die  vertroue
uitspreek dat 'n eersteklas aanbieding daartoe mag lei  dat  Suid-Afrika  se
gradering op alle vlakke regoor die wêreld sal styg. Dit is  'n  geleentheid
om Suid-Afrika te bevorder  as  toeristebestemming,  beleggersbestemming  en
gewaardeerde handelsvennoot. Ook die 1 600  permanente  werkgeleenthede  wat
as gevolg van die beraad geskep gaan word, is 'n belangrike  byvoordeel  wat
nie misgekyk mag word nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Madam Speaker, a great honour has been bestowed upon South Africa, that  of
acting as host for the coming World Summit on Sustainable  Development.  The
AEB is all too well aware of the giant task  of  making  a  success  of  the
summit that rests on the shoulders of the organisers, the many  role-players
and the volunteers.

We want to wish Minister Moosa and his team everything of the  best  and  we
want to express our confidence that a first-class presentation may  lead  to
an elevation in South Africa's grading  at  every  level  right  across  the
globe. It is an opportunity to promote South Africa  as  a  destination  for
tourists and investors and as a valued partner in trade.  Also,  the  1  600
permanent job opportunities that are going to be created as a result of  the
summit is an important additional advantage that may not be overlooked.]

Please ensure that Mr McHugh of Ireland is not one of the officials.

Die vraagstuk omtrent volhoubare ontwikkeling is van  kardinale  belang  vir
alle lande regoor die wêreld. Een van die  belangrikste  beginsels  wat  die
Bybel ons  leer,  is  dié  van  verantwoordelike  rentmeesterskap.  Koos  du
Plessis sing in sy bekende ``Gebed": ``Wat ek is,  is  net  genade,  wat  ek
het, is net geleen.'' Die gedagte is duidelik: Ons moet só  omgaan  met  wat
die Skepper tot ons beskikking gestel  het  dat  ons  nie  blote  parasiete,
blote opgebruikers word nie, maar dat komende geslagte  ook  'n  ruimte  kan
vind in ons land, ons kontinent en oor die hele wêreld.

In die laaste strofe van ``Die Stem van Suid-Afrika''  bid  ons,  ``...  dat
die erwe van ons vaad're vir ons kinders erwe bly.'' Dit kan  in  'n  sekere
sin die leuse wees op die beraad. Enige suksesvolle boer sal vir 'n mens  sê
as jy boer, kan jy nie net kyk na vanjaar se oes, net om  volgende  jaar  'n
uitgetrapte plaas te hê nie. 'n Mens moet so boer dat jy volgende  jaar  nog
kan boer, en meer nog, dat jou seun ná jou ook kan boer en dat  jou  buurman
ook water vir sy beeste het.

In die wêreld is daar  vandag  inderdaad  'n  legio  gevare  vir  volhoubare
ontwikkeling. Die verhitting van die atmosfeer, die  toename  van  skadelike
aardgasse, die uitwissing van mariene bronne en ja, ook  die  vraagstuk  van
armoede wat die hele wêreld bekruip,  is  maar  enkele  voorbeelde.  Dit  is
krities  belangrik  dat  hierdie  sake  met  verantwoordelikheid  en  oorleg
gehanteer sal word.

Die AEB wil egter waarsku teen een gevaar: Terwyl  Suid-Afrika  die  gasheer
is, moet ons daartoe bydra dat die beraad  nie  ontaard  in  'n  onsmaaklike
polarisasie tussen die ``haves'' en die ``have nots'' nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The question concerning sustainable development is of vital  importance  to
countries right across the globe. One of the most important principles  that
the Bible teaches us is the principle of responsible  stewardship.  Koos  du
Plessis sings in his well- known song Gebed: ''Wat ek  is,  is  net  genade;
wat ek het, is net geleen.'' The sentiment is obvious:  We  must  deal  with
what the Creator has put at our disposal in such a manner  that  we  do  not
become mere parasites and consumers, but so that  future  generations  could
also find a place in our country,  our  continent  as  well  as  the  entire
world.

In the last verse of ``Die Stem'' of South Africa, we pray: ...''  that  the
heritage they give us for our children yet may be''. This can in  a  certain
sense be the slogan at the summit. Any successful farmer will tell one  that
when one is a farmer one cannot just look at this year's crop, only to  have
a denuded farm the next year. One must farm in such a manner  that  one  can
still farm the following year; and more so, that one's son  can  farm  after
one and that one's neighbour also has water for his cattle.

There are indeed numerous threats to sustainable development  in  the  world
today. The warming of  the  atmosphere,  the  increase  in  harmful  natural
gases, the eradication of marine resources and yes,  also  the  question  of
poverty that stalks the world are  but  a  few  examples.  It  is  of  vital
importance that these issues  should  be  handled  with  responsibility  and
consideration.

The AEB however, wants to warn against one danger:  While  South  Africa  is
the host we must make a contribution to the summit not degenerating into  an
unpleasant polarisation between the haves and the have nots.]

We must take care that the summit does  not  become  an  exercise  of  blame
shifting on the industrialised countries of the  world,  or  the  other  way
round. Something like this happened with  the  World  Conference  on  Racism
recently held in South Africa. During that  conference,  the  South  African
Minister of Foreign Affairs played an important role and tried her  best  to
avoid just that. We call on Minister Moosa and every  important  role-player
in South Africa to do their utmost so that the summit should not  turn  into
an event of the good, the bad and the ugly.

Die AEB wens hulle alle sterkte toe met die belangrike beraad. Mag  dit  nog
baie vir ons land en vir die toekoms van alle bewoners van  hierdie  planeet
beteken. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The AEB wishes them well with this important  summit.  May  it  hold  great
promise for our country and for the future of all  the  inhabitants  of  our
planet.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam  Speaker,  every  society  strives  to  create  a
political,  social  and  economic  framework  around   which   developmental
processes can take place. The political, social and economic  framework  can
be referred to as a system in which role-players are allowed to  participate
provided they stick by  the  rules.  In  modern  society,  these  rules  are
formalised by way of laws,  various  conventions  and  agreements  that  are
entered into amongst nations of  the  world.  Most,  if  not  all  of  these
conventions and agreements, are in favour of the rich.

The  poor  always  get  marginalised  and  their  activities  are  seen   as
mitigating against good governance and order, meaning  good  governance  and
order in favour of the rich. This is what happens when the poor do not  have
access to clean water; when the rich pollute the environment; when the  rich
sell drugs to poor at  exorbitant  prices;  when  there  is  no  fair  trade
between poor and rich countries; when the  capitalist  system  of  the  rich
marginalises the poor into poverty; and when the rich regard all of this  as
normal.  Therefore,  for  the  poor,  the  World   Summit   on   Sustainable
Development should mean an arena of struggle against very  powerful  forces.
For the poor and poor countries, the conference should be a platform to  let
the rich know that  their  survival  is  dependent  on  the  eradication  of
poverty and all forms of deprivation that the poor live under.

For poor countries, in particular, the agenda should  be  to  challenge  the
rich  countries  to  understand  that  within   the   global   developmental
framework,  poverty  eradication,  the  creation  of  a  clean  environment,
equitable distribution of resources to all earth's children and  the  ending
of trade imbalances between rich and  poor  countries  is  fundamental.  The
success of sustainable development in a world where the majority  are  poor,
can only be judged by the way in which it is  capable  of  transforming  the
material conditions under which  poor  people,  all  over  the  world,  find
themselves into something better and its  ability  to  enable  the  poor  to
sustain the developmental processes.

The outcome of the conference should be  capable  of  creating  an  enabling
environment and conditions that create a better world for all.

Mr M I MOSS: Madam Speaker, I am privileged to speak in this debate  on  the
World Summit on Sustainable Development as  it  is,  in  many  aspects,  the
biggest and the most important gathering of people from all  walks  of  life
to  ensure  that  planet  earth  will  not  only  be  preserved  for  future
generations, but that the plight  of  the  poor  will  be  relieved  through
sustainable development.

Since the World Summit on Sustainable  Development  will  address  virtually
all issues one can think of, I shall limit my input  to  matters  pertaining
to the environment, fishing and the protection of  the  coastal  and  marine
life. South Africa has proved itself as a champion  in  the  world  when  it
comes to the issues of  protection  and  conservation  of  the  environment,
biodiversity, fishing and marine resources.

To substantiate the above, is the fact that we  are  one  of  the  very  few
countries in the world that can significantly increase the  total  allowable
catch of  fish  stocks  and  other  marine  resources  in  our  waters.  Our
population of wildlife is growing and our national parks are  expanding  all
the time. These constructive and positive developments take  place  in  full
consultation and partnership with  communities,  especially  those  directly
affected. An example is the San Heritage Land and Mier Heritage  Land  which
will be subject to separate contract  park  agreements  with  South  African
National Parks. According to this agreement, South  African  National  Parks
will conserve the animals, plants and natural environment  on  the  heritage
land. The community parties may, by means  of  the  entity  that  represents
them, use the land  in  terms  of  the  agreement  as  landowners.  The  two
communities may also use the land for symbolic and  cultural  purposes.  The
South African National Parks and the community parties  will  form  a  joint
management board.
This month is women's month and  our  chairperson,  who  is  also  a  woman,
started the debate on  a  very  positive  note.  I  want  to  add  that  our
Government has allocated fishing quotas to many women who not only  work  at
sea, but also add value to the product. They also participate  in  the  full
process of the fishing industry, including exports.

Within the African process, African countries have undertaken an  integrated
and innovative  approach  to  the  protection  of  the  coastal  and  marine
environments  with  the  overall  aim  of  enhancing  sustainable   economic
development, food and economic security and addressing poverty  eradication.
The African process has achieved substantial political support and has  been
warmly endorsed by the African Union and the African Ministerial  Conference
on the Environment. Most recently, it has been integrated into  the  coastal
and marine component of the environment initiative of  the  New  Partnership
for Africa's Development.

The years of hard work since the  inception  of  the  African  process  have
finally proved to be a reality.  By  joining  hands,  we  shall  ensure  the
success not only of the partnership conference, but also of further work  on
the African process.

Over the past  century,  governments  all  over  the  world,  including  the
previous South African government before 1994, had no respect or  mercy  for
the environment at large. Many fish species decreased and were on the  brink
of extinction.  In  South  African  waters  fish  stocks  are  beginning  to
recover.

The Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Valli Moosa, who  is  and
will be playing a key role at the World Summit for Sustainable  Development,
said in Parliament recently, and I quote:


  For most of this period, our ancestors lived in harmony with nature. Over
  the  millennia,  human  beings  advanced   socially,   economically   and
  culturally, never once facing self-destruction. All that changed  in  the
  last 100 years. Human beings, for the first time, started destroying  the
  very earth which we need for our survival.
A lack of resources to combat the above has led to  a  massive  decrease  of
abalone on our coasts. Patagonian  toothfish  populations  in  the  Southern
Ocean are declining at an alarming rate as a result  of  over  a  decade  of
overfishing mainly by illegal, unreported and unregulated operators.

Die uitdruklike doelwit  van  menige  internasionale  mariene,  vissery-  of
kusooreenkoms is ingestel op die bevordering van die volhoubaarheid van  die
bron op  die  lang  termyn.  Terselfdertyd  moet  politieke  stabiliteit  op
wêreldvlak  verseker  word  deur  die  verwydering  van  die   oorsake   van
konflikte, ekonomies of andersins.

Alhoewel  dit  edele  doelwitte  is  hierdie,  is  die  realiteit  dat   die
kompleksiteit  van  die  ooreenkomste  en  die  gebrek  aan   internasionale
beheerstandaarde lei tot die bevoordeling van die ontwikkelde lande.  Gesien
in die lig van hierdie lande se  lang  geskiedenis  van  uitbuiting  is  dit
daarom van kardinale belang dat die ontwikkelende  lande  moet  saamspan  om
beheerstandaarde daar  te  stel  wat  sal  voldoen  aan  die  beginsels  van
regverdigheid, gelykheid en nie-diskriminasie in die oseane en  ten  opsigte
van kusbeheer op nasionale, streeks- en wêreldvlak.  Hierdie  standaarde  en
beheerraamwerk moet  ook  voorsiening  maak  vir  'n  heroorweging  van  die
toekenningsvereistes.

Die verminderende visbronne in die ontwikkelde wêreld en die gevolglike  hoë
pryse van vis en verwante produkte het oor die afgelope  dekades  gelei  tot
die verskuiwing van die fokus van hierdie  lande  na  die  meer  oorvloedige
visbronne  van  die  ontwikkelende  lande.  Hierdie   faktor,   tesame   met
oorbefondsing en die feit dat regerings van die ontwikkelde  lande  massiewe
subsidies uitdeel, het  gelei  tot  'n  verkragting  van  visbronne  in  die
ontwikkelende lande.

Tans is daar 'n  groot  beweging  van  die  waters  van  geïndustrialiseerde
ontwikkelde lande na die waters  van  die  ontwikkelende  lande.  Hulle  het
toegang bekom deur vennootskappe aan te gaan met plaaslike  maatskappye  wat
'n  tekort  het  aan  gepaste  skepe  en  implemente,  en  deur  die  nodige
ooreenkomste met ander regerings en dié van ontwikkelende lande.

In die strewe na 'n uitvoergeoriënteerde beleid is dit noodsaaklik dat  daar
gewaak word teen  die  toekenning  van  kwotaregte  en  permitte  aan  groot
uitvoermaatskappye ten koste  van  kleinskaal-  en  bestaansvissermanne.  'n
Voorkeur aan 'n toekenningsbeleid ten gunste  van  groot  uitvoermaatskappye
sal later daartoe lei dat kusgemeenskappe uiteindelik toegang  tot  'n  baie
belangrike voedselbron ontneem word en dat  vis  slegs  'n  luukse-item  sal
word op die tafels van  mense  in  die  ontwikkelde  wêreld,  wat  reeds  'n
oorvloed voedsel het. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The express objective of many  international  marine,  fishing  or  coastal
agreements is geared to the promotion of the sustainability of the  resource
in the long term. Simultaneously, political  stability  at  a  global  level
must be ensured by the removal of  the  causes  of  conflicts,  economic  or
otherwise.
Although these are noble  objectives,  in  reality  the  complexity  of  the
agreements and the lack of international control  standards  result  in  the
favouring of the developed  countries.  In  view  of  these  countrys'  long
history  of  exploitation,  it  is  therefore  vitally  important  that  the
developed countries must work together to set control  standards  that  will
comply with the principles of fairness, equality and  non-discrimination  in
the oceans and in respect of  coastal  control  at  national,  regional  and
global level. These standards and  the  control  framework  must  also  make
provision for a reconsideration of the allocation requirements.

Reduced fishing resources  in  the  developed  world  and  concomitant  high
prices of fish and related products during the past few decades have  caused
a shift  in  focus  from  these  countries  to  the  more  abundant  fishing
resources  of  the  developing  countries.  This   factor,   together   with
overfunding and the fact that the governments of  developed  countries  hand
out massive subsidies, has led to the exploitation of fishing  resources  in
developing countries.

At present there is a large movement  from  the  waters  of  industrialised,
developed countries  to  the  waters  of  developing  countries.  They  have
obtained access by entering into partnerships with local  companies  lacking
suitable ships and implements and by means of the necessary agreements  with
other governments and those of developing countries.

In pursuit of an export-orientated policy it  is  essential  that  we  guard
against  the  allocation  of  quota  rights  and  permits  to  large  export
companies at the expense of small-scale and subsistence fishermen.  Priority
in allocation policy in favour of large export companies will  later  result
in coastal communities ultimately being deprived of a very important  source
of food, and that fish will become only a  luxury  item  on  the  tables  of
people in the developed world, which already has an abundance of food.]

The people who will  be  gathering  at  the  World  Summit  for  Sustainable
Development will have to  ensure  that  the  slogan,  ``People,  Planet  and
Prosperity'' will preserve planet  earth  for  generations  to  come.  South
Africa will certainly play a big  role  to  ensure  that  the  focus  is  on
poverty  eradication,  sustainable  development  and  access  to  water  and
sanitation,  energy,  health  care,  food  security  and  biodiversity   and
ecosystem protection. The summit  will  also  be  about  implementation  and
delivery. [Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Madam Speaker, special greetings this afternoon  to  Ms  Gwen
Mahlangu-Nkabinde. We are very proud to be part of her team.

Ecotourism,   defined   by   the   International   Ecotourism   Society   as
``responsible  travel  that  conserves  the  environment  and  sustains  the
wellbeing of local people'', is one of the fastest growing segments  of  the
tourism industry. As many as 60% of international tourists travelled  during
the 1990s to experience and enjoy nature.

Ecotourists are  usually  very  environmentally  aware  and  South  Africa's
hosting of the World Summit this month offers a window  of  opportunity  for
our  tourism  industry  to  confirm  its  commitment  to   sustainable   and
responsible tourism.

We are probably all aware of the benefits that  tourism  can  bring  to  our
country. President Thabo Mbeki,  in  an  article  in  Sawubona  this  month,
states:


  For us in South Africa, tourism is part of  the  long  walk  to  economic
  freedom, as the natural beauty and diversity of  our  people  are  shared
  with visitors.

Some of these benefits include  the  fact  that  roughly  65%  of  new  jobs
created by tourism annually are found  in  the  developing  world.  Many  of
these positions go to women. Approximately 45%  of  workers  in  the  hotel,
catering and restaurant sectors are women - a much higher share than in  the
labour market overall. Did the hon members know  that  90%  of  the  world's
tourism enterprises are small businesses, from family-owned  restaurants  to
one-person snorkeling operations?

The tourism branch of the Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism
has initiated the development of an integrated Ecotourism  Development  Plan
for South Africa as well as the Generic Guidelines for  Responsible  Tourism
Development.  These  responsible  tourism  guidelines  are   voluntary   and
intended to protect and enhance the environment in which they  operate,  all
of which dovetails very nicely with the aims of the World Summit.

Measurement  of  good,   sustainable   environmental   best   practice,   an
environmental management system and an awards programme  will  position  the
hospitality industry  in  South  Africa  as  world  leaders  in  sustainable
development. The working group, consisting of  representatives  of  Southern
Sun,  Intercontinental,  FEDHASA,  JOWSCO  and  certain  Metro  councils  in
Gauteng, certainly deserves credit for these proposals.

An initiative by the Association of Independent  Tour  Operators,  Aito,  to
avoid  destinations  and  properties  where  no   environmental   management
programmes have been established was confirmed by the recent  signing  of  a
memorandum  of  understanding  between  these  leading  international   tour
operators.

The  guidelines  are  based  on  very   similar   social,   economical   and
environmental principles, which also govern the greening of the summit  such
as air quality and pollution, by  managing  and  reducing,  where  possible,
emissions  into  the  atmosphere;  community  and  social  involvement,   by
managing and involving all stakeholders such as the local  community,  staff
and guests in the  environmental  programme;  measuring  and  monitoring  of
appropriate  short-term  and  long-term  energy  usage  such  as  oil,  gas,
electricity, petrol, wood, etc; taking positive steps in the management  and
creation  of  awareness   of   relevant   health   issues   like   HIV/Aids,
tuberculosis, hepatitis and waterborne diseases; procurement  policies  that
are conducted with  minimum  impact  on  the  environment;  the  collection,
storage  and  recycling  of  waste  material  and  by-products   and   water
conservation.

I do not have much time to go into much detail on  the  above,  but  members
might be interested to know that one of the visible features of  the  summit
will be the consumption barometer which will demonstrate, on a daily  basis,
how much carbon the summit  is  generating,  how  much  waste  is  going  to
landfills, how much is being recycled and  how  much  water  and  energy  is
being used. The barometer will be displayed at major  venues  on  electronic
billboards and published in daily newspapers.

Members of the hospitality industry have been asked to sign a  statement  of
intent,  committing  themselves  to  implementing  a   responsible   tourism
programme and all signatories will be listed in a Responsible Tourism  Guide
for South Africa. These programmes, initiated in part by the holding of  the
World Summit, will leave a lasting legacy for sustainable tourism  in  South
Africa. [Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, from a South African perspective  the  World
Summit  is  already  a  success  even  before  it  has  begun.   For   that,
congratulations must go to the Departments of Environment,  of  Agriculture,
and of Arts and Culture, our hon Gwen  Mahlangu  and  JOWSCO,  because  they
have managed to co-ordinate their efforts, which is something  that  we  are
not always good at doing. [Applause.]

They have managed to prevent the summit from becoming an avenue for any  one
of the major players to force the agenda, either of business, government  or
so-called civil society. I say so-called, because no group  or  organisation
can claim to be the single representative voice of civil society.

The summit has offered a platform for all  to  work  towards  the  goals  of
partnerships between the developed and  the  developing  world  and  between
business, Government and civil society. If  goals  are  scored  by  opposing
teams, the game will be lost. It will be won if we collectively ensure  that
the globalising world unfolds in a way that narrows  the  gap  between  rich
and poor and that it enables the earth to prosper.

Preliminary success has been felt mainly in Gauteng, where an  explosion  of
energy has triggered into action schemes that have been in the pipeline  for
many years. A core of young people and all parts of  communities  have  been
trained in tourism and now  understand  that  everything  they  do  makes  a
difference to the planet.

The entire universe comprises energy. Energy has as much power to create  as
to destroy. Everything in the world is ecologically linked,  whether  it  is
nature, society, economics or politics, and in  all  fields  every  positive
step has a ripple effect that takes us forward, and every negative one on  a
downward spiral.

There will be logistical problems  at  the  summit.  There  may  not  be  an
agreement on time frames, but these will  not  constitute  failure.  Failure
will result if NGOs place their demand for time frames, which are  extremely
difficult to set realistically, above  a  collective  intention  to  improve
life on this earth.

Failure will result if promises of partnership  between  the  developed  and
developing  worlds  are  not  realised  into  technology  transfer,   shared
research and joint programmes.

Failure will result if we do not find a  way  to  globalise  equity  and  to
agree across continents on how to draft patent laws, so that they  encourage
development while respecting and protecting  the  indigenous  knowledge  and
goods, such as rooibos tea, of local people.

If we compress 15 billion years of the history of the Cosmos into one  year,
humans emerged on 31 December and began their  ascendancy  one  hour  before
midnight. It has taken less than half a second  to  threaten  the  continued
existence of life on earth and in the  next  millisecond  it  could  all  be
gone. Hopefully, this seminal  Summit  will  set  us  on  an  uphill  spiral
towards the twenty-first century.

The IFP wishes the organisers and the visitors  ``indlela  entle''  [a  safe
and rewarding journey]. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, it is my very pleasant  task  this
afternoon ... [Interjections] ... when the babble on my left stops,  to  say
that I appreciate very much the high degree not only of consensus, but  also
of agreement reached in the House.

The cynic might say, of course, if there is agreement, it  must  be  a  very
artificial situation. But I think the cynic,  as  some  Irishman  said,  who
knows the price of everything and the value of nothing, would  be  wrong.  I
am very proud of this House, because this session was enormously  important.
It was enormously important to relate our  own  existential  issues  to  the
rest of the world. It is more enormously important that we  have  reached  a
degree of understanding of that, because it is important.

Secondly, I do not think it is the numbers that will  make  the  conference.
It will not be the heads of state  that  will  make  the  world  conference,
although I think we will feel good about it that the  numbers  make  it  the
largest conference ever.

I do not think it is these physical manifestations. It will largely  be  the
way in which we can strengthen the international consensus  on  the  various
issues that the hon members have spoken about, and how we  can  forward  the
battle. There is a real battle here. That is why I think it is important  to
recognise that  30  years  ago,  when  the  first  conference  was  held  on
development in Stockholm, for the first  time,  they  could  say  that  they
would talk about the human environment, not only the  physical  environment.
Then, 10 years ago, at the extraordinary conference in Rio  de  Janeiro,  in
which many of us took part - not as a governmental delegation,  but  because
it was necessary to redeem the earth and humanity,  the  emphasis  there  in
Rio was really about environmental and social policies and  priorities.  For
the first time, the world related social policies to the environment.

That is why I believe, myself, that there is an opportunity in  Johannesburg
now to project this  understanding.  We,  particularly,  will  play  a  very
important part, because Africa will be the centrepiece in this. That is  why
that I regret very much that there was no agreement here.

The hon Moorcroft must realise that the essence of this conference  is  that
it is an intergovernmental conference. South African participation  will  be
limited to the two Ministers and the President who will be  there.  That  is
why we pushed  very  hard  for  the  other  areas  of  involvement  so  that
parliamentarians can play a part in that. That is why it is  important  that
in the parliamentary session, we cannot have more  than  25,  because  there
are 180 countries taking part in this.  That  is  why  it  is  important  to
recognise that it will be a South African position reflecting the  views  of
this House. It is a common South African position  that  will  be  reflected
there. I think it is very important that a  common  South  African  position
will be there. South Africa and Africa will play an important  part  in  the
world  summit.  Therefore,  the  slogan  that  everybody  has  referred  to,
``People, planet  and  prosperity'',  will  play  a  leading  part  for  our
continent.

However, how ever much agreement  there  may  be,  we  must  recognise  that
whatever our focus, we must also bear in mind that  notions  of  development
are contested.  Conceptions  of  development  are  shaped  by  many  issues,
contradictions,  challenges  and,  more   importantly,   opportunities.   We
therefore  need  to  ensure  that  the  real  developmental  needs  of   our
continent, our country and the developing world  are  at  the  forefront  of
this summit's deliberations.

A very famous bishop in Brazil once said that, in fact, development must  be
to exercise one's option for the poor. Exercising the option  for  the  poor
must be the central feature. That is why there will  be  contestation,  not,
in fact,  a  deliberate  attempt  to  sour  relations,  but  there  will  be
differences of world view at the conference.
The whole issue, for example, of debt relief  or  debt  abolition,  and  the
issue of trading patterns are enormously important for  the  south.  In  the
same way, the transfer of technology is also an  important  issue.  We  have
moved away from declaratory resolutions, which we  had  at  Monterey,  where
five billion was offered, to a much greater understanding  of  Nepad  as  to
what the exact needs of our continent and, therefore, of the world are.

The market itself cannot resolve these contradictions and problems  that  we
face.  There  must,  therefore,  be  social  intervention.  There  must   be
intervention  by  states,  between  states  and  within  the  community   to
recognise the real basis of development. So, central to this is  championing
the issue which I have been asked to speak about, which is the  relationship
between education and development. There, I have  answered  the  hon  member
who asked me.

As Africans, we assert that education is key  to  confronting  the  multiple
challenges of social dislocation, of environmental degradation  and  poverty
eradication. We must assert that education is  a  vital  process  to  attain
human development goals, and to place the African continent on  the  pathway
of sustainability.

So members should appreciate that no country or region is ever  successfully
developed  without  adequate  levels  of  human   capital.   Investment   in
education, therefore, is crucial.  Our  own  President's  emphasis,  in  his
state-of-the-nation address in February, was to talk about the  dynamics  of
development in our country. However, many make the mistake of  reducing  the
role of education to simply that of economic development. There is no  doubt
that economic  development  forms  one  of  the  foundations.  Most  experts
believe that economic development without skills development will  lead,  in
fact, to a cul-de-sac.

This narrow interpretation  therefore,  misses  the  necessary  contribution
that education makes to the development of values such as good  citizenship,
justice, tolerance, sensitivity to the environment and peace. If we  exclude
these ethical factors,  then  we  will  have  the  situation  of  Enron,  of
WorldCom, of America  Online,  of  Vivendi  and  many  others,  where  greed
becomes the main motivating force for human existence.

The market, as Adam Smith once thought, might moderate greed. However,  Adam
Smith's ghost will be  turning  around  now,  because  the  market  has  not
mediated as far as  greed  is  concerned.  The  collapse  of  the  financial
markets, then, ... [Interjections] ... I see that hon  member  has  grown  a
beard now. He will look very much like Lenin now! [Interjections.]

The  collapse  of  the  financial  market  has  shown  that  there  must  be
mediation. The  mediation  must  be  one  of  solidarity,  an  understanding
between states that economic systems are not cast in stone, and  that  their
developments have to take place  to  meet  the  needs.  Education  plays  an
important   role   in   providing   for   sustainable   and    comprehensive
understanding.

The investment in education on the continent has steadily  declined  through
the adoption of policies  laid  down  by  external  financial  agencies,  by
greed, corruption, the lack of ability of governments  to  act  or  lack  of
will. This, in turn, has reduced our institutional capacity to  sustain  the
quantity and quality of output in the production  of  intellectual  capital.
Many African universities, once  proud  centres  of  excellence,  have  been
unable to keep pace with technological innovations  to  sustain  the  up-to-
date libraries  and  information  systems  vital  to  the  cutting  edge  of
research. Enabling  environments  and  richer  countries  continue  to  draw
promising   intellectuals   away   from   the   difficult   and    sometimes
incapacitating realities of many universities on our continent.

Public schools have suffered similarly in terms  of  resources  and  skilled
personnel. Illiteracy rates remain high as  33,4%  for  men  and  52,7%  for
women in sub-Saharan Africa. Wars deny education to young  boys  and  girls,
forced into fighting at an early age.  Gender  inequalities  that  privilege
male children in terms  of  attitudes,  opportunities  and  economic  duties
prevent and discourage girls from receiving education.  More  than  half  of
school-aged girls in 22 countries do not even receive an education.  So,  we
will require a capital injection in Nepad with the demand for  U$64  billion
a year. Central to Nepad is  the  question  of  human-resource  development.
Human-resource development will drive, therefore, the revolution in Africa.

As for ourselves, we know that investment in our people  is  no  luxury.  We
know and realise  that  education  is  a  process  and  that,  today,  in  a
technological world  and,  to  use  a  catchphrase,  through  globalisation,
education does not end with a final qualification. That is why we are  going
to take a lead in Africa to help our  brothers  and  sisters  in  Africa  by
convening the first conference on distance education next year, so  that  we
can share our remarkable capacity in distance education with countries  that
have not yet moved in that direction.

There has to be some statement about what this conference will  do  for  the
poor. I do not think the conference will do anything for  the  poor.  It  is
the standards  the  conference  will  set  that  we  must  invoke.  I  will,
therefore, say that as far as we are concerned, it is not doom and gloom.

We can now show that we have the highest  proportion  of  girl  children  in
schools in the Third World, and we are possibly  leading  there.  More  than
50% of our students in universities and technikons are young women. We  have
a virtual 100% participation rate in primary school education. We  have  the
highest proportion of children in the secondary cycle in  Africa.  All  this
has been achieved through the commitment we have made to our people.  It  is
not something for self-glorification. It is simply that  we  recognise  that
we must make this kind of leap in the educational world.

The  international  community,  therefore,  has  made   great   strides   in
widespread consensus for a global agenda for education  and  training  since
Rio,  and  in  many  other  areas  we  have  a  never-diminishing  role  for
declaratory resolutions passed, because declaratory resolutions  can  become
the basis for building on that. We know, after Rio, the treaties  that  deal
with the environment have come into force. They are  a  matter  of  enormous
importance, because they are being implemented. The  floods  in  Europe  and
the Far East show  how  we  cannot  play  the  fool  with  our  environment.
Therefore, we have to grapple through public opinion to ensure that some  of
the  more  negative  aspects  of  non-ratification  of  the   protocol   are
challenged.

I end by saying that it is enormously important for us to  show  that  sense
of  solidarity  with  Africa,  but  understanding  that  without  joint  and
collective action, we cannot do anything. I think myself, on behalf  of  the
Government,  that  what  Johannesburg  will  show  is  the  last  stage  or,
possibly, the last chance that we have to  deal  with  the  enormous  issues
such as health - including the eccentric views of Mr Swart -  and,  for  the
first time, water and sanitation are playing a central role. We must  ensure
that the countries of the north are able to target  and  take  part  in  the
implementation.

I think it is a glorious opportunity in which this House  is  reflected.  We
can  build  a  world  fit  for  all  our  children  to  live  in,  and  make
Johannesburg succeed in that. Phambili,  phambili,  Johannesburg!  [Forward,
Johannesburg!]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 16:50.
