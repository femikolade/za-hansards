                   PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS

                                  (Debate)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,  hon
members, today, in the year of the  volunteer  for  the  reconstruction  and
development of our country, I wish to dedicate this speech  to  one  of  the
stalwarts  and  chief  volunteers  of  the  ANC,  Comrade   Wilton   Mkwayi.
[Applause.]

In 1955, our people converged at the Congress of the People in  Kliptown  to
discuss the kind of a South Africa they  want  to  build.  They  derived  an
important demand which captured the imagination of  the  young  and  old,  a
demand which encapsulated a vision for a future South Africa  and  a  battle
cry for different generations engaged in a  struggle  for  a  united,  free,
nonracial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa.

They sought to do this because of  their  frustration  with  the  manner  in
which our country was being governed. They also understood  and  hoped  that
this country could be run better for the benefit of all who live in it,  and
thus loudly proclaimed: ``The people shall govern.''

The fourth session of our second democratic Parliament began on Friday  with
the formal opening address by the President of  the  Republic.  Millions  of
our people watched this event with pride  and  profound  interest.  That  in
itself  bears  testimony  to  the  gigantic  strides  we   are   making   in
democritising our country. Our people watched these  proceedings  with  keen
interest, because to them it was,  indeed,  a  celebration  of  freedom  and
democracy; a celebration of coming to fruition of that important  clause  of
the Freedom Charter which inspired  different  generations  of  our  people,
young and old, to engage in a struggle to fight against the  white  minority
regime and replace it with a government that is based on  the  will  of  the
people.

The  mood  of  excitement  and  expectation  associated  with   this   event
epitomises the change from the undemocratic past that was  characterised  by
uninspiring  and  unfriendly  institutions.  Contrary  to  our   past,   our
democratic Parliament has become an institution  on  which  our  people  pin
their hopes for deliverance  from  hunger  and  want.  This  does  not  hold
through for the previous parliament, which was an expression of  oppression,
exploitation and racial discrimination.

This year marks the seventh year  since  the  advent  of  democracy  in  our
country. We have progressed in working towards a Parliament  which  reflects
and enhances the processes of democratic change. steadily but surely we  are
making strides in transforming our country. The slogan  ``the  people  shall
govern'' is now a reality which inspires our people to  deepen  and  advance
our cause to build a nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and  prosperous  South
Africa.
The hon the President's inspiring address to this House  sounded  a  clarion
call to the entire nation. It has clearly articulated what we need to do  as
South Africans, to succeed and be a winning nation. The  focus  we  continue
to place on the struggle to eradicate poverty, is  further  confirmation  of
the commitment that this Government has to build a better life for  all.  He
correctly pointed out that the  central  question  that  we  would  have  to
answer at the end of the day is:


  ... whether what we are doing as the legislature, the executive  and  the
  judiciary, as well as the fourth estate and civil society, is helping  to
  lift from the shoulders of our people the intolerable burden  of  poverty
  and underdevelopment.

The focus of my speech is to define the central role  that  Parliament  must
play in rolling back the frontiers of poverty and  building  a  better  life
for all. Parliament has an obligation of passing legislation  which  governs
our  people's  lives.  The  legislation  that  has  been  passed   in   this
institution since 1994  has  provided  a  legal  framework  to  improve  the
quality of the life of our people and to accelerate  the  transformation  of
our society.

Public  representatives  also  have  a  responsibility  to  discharge  their
obligations as members of this  institution.  They  have  to  represent  the
interests of the people who elected them to  this  institution.  We  have  a
heavy burden of ensuring that our democracy functions properly, and that  it
addresses the interest of the majority of our people.  This  means,  amongst
other things, that we must be accountable to  the  public;  we  must  report
back  to  the  public  and  raise  public  mandates  in  this   institution,
Parliament.

The tasks that face our public representatives are enormous and  it  becomes
important that as Parliament continues  to  transform  itself  to  become  a
peoples Parliament, it must  develop  appropriate  systems  to  support  and
empower public representatives to carry their mandates with  greater  levels
of efficiency and professionalism. We need to do more to  equip  our  public
representatives with skills for information technology and  other  forms  of
training. Parliament needs to develop the most appropriate infrastructure  -
physical and human resources - to enable us  to  fulfil  our  constitutional
prerogative. Most importantly, we need to define in  clear  and  unambiguous
terms the kind of public representatives that can be oriented  to  focus  on
the historic challenge of the eradication of poverty.

Our work as this august House needs to be judged on the extent to  which  we
contribute to the eradication of poverty and  underdevelopment  in  our  own
country. By way of introspection, we need to acknowledge the fact that  this
House through its debates and other work, has not performed  with  unity  of
purpose and action to the achievement of our national  goal  of  building  a
caring and people-centred society.

Short-term political point-scoring tended to be the main determining  factor
of some pronouncements and policy positions. We, in  the  ANC,  have  always
sought to build national consensus on fundamental matters that confront  our
nation.

We welcome the commitment by our  Government  to  continue  embarking  on  a
comprehensive strategy to fight the scourge of HIV/Aids in our  society.  We
can say, without fear of contradiction, that our Government cares about  the
HIV/Aids pandemic,  which  continues  to  ruin  the  lives  of  our  people.
However, we  must  inculcate  a  sense  of  responsibility  and  sensitivity
amongst ourselves as public representatives in the manner in which  we  deal
with issues of this nature. We cannot afford to politicise a matter of  live
and death such as HIV/Aids.

  Last  year,  we  witnessed  a  number  of  statements  and  actions  which
undermined the integrity of the House. These statements  were  made  because
of an obscure understanding of the notion of  oversight.  A  simplistic  and
narrow understanding of the  oversight  function  of  this  Parliament  only
means, for the  DP  and  its  cohorts,  that  the  legislature  should  have
adversarial relations with the executive. This is not our understanding.

Our premise in understanding oversight moves from the understanding that  we
need to move in unity to roll back the frontiers  of  poverty  and,  at  the
same time, strengthen our  democracy.  This  means  that  we  need  to  have
constructive  relations  with  the  executive   without   compromising   our
oversight  responsibility.  Therefore,  our  task  is  to  see  to  it  that
Government's policy is in line with the supreme law of the country and  that
Government's programme  is  implemented  within  the  legislative  framework
passed  in  Parliament.  Where  there  are  mistakes  and  shortcomings   in
implementing Government's  policies,  the  legislature  should  be  able  to
intervene timeously and sensitise the executive and the public  about  these
shortcomings.

Therefore, this means that there  has  to  be  a  constructive  and  dynamic
interaction between the legislature and the executive, as they both  operate
within the framework of the Constitution of our country, and have  a  common
goal of eradicating poverty, strengthening our democracy and developing  our
society.

The challenges that face our country are enormous. Our people expect  public
representatives to provide guidance and hope during these trying  times.  We
need to mobilise and rally our people behind the agenda  of  transformation,
if we have the political will to strengthen this  new  democracy.  Political
parties  represented  in   this   House   have   diverse   backgrounds   and
constituencies with diverse interests which are,  sometimes,  contradictory.
Yet, there are issues that cut across different sectors, class,  racial  and
religious groupings, which are of common concern to all of us.

It thus becomes  imperative  that,  despite  our  differences  as  political
parties, we need to identify issues which are of common concern  to  all  of
us and jointly seek solutions.  We  need  to  do  this  in  the  spirit  and
commitment of building a new nation.

The ANC is  committed  to  working  with  all  political  parties  to  reach
national consensus without  compromising  our  people-centred  policies.  In
pursuit of this objective, we cannot be  blinded  into  believing  that  all
opposition political parties are necessarily patriotic. We must be  able  to
distinguish between  a  patriotic  opposition  and  a  counter-revolutionary
opposition.  [Applause.] By so doing, we will certainly be moving away  from
our painful  past,  which  has  been  characterised  by  racism  and  racial
divisions.

The President of the Republic of South Africa, His Excellency Comrade  Thabo
Mbeki, made a clarion call to the people to join the Vuk'uzenzele  campaign.
This calls on our people to play an active role in the process  of  positive
change. The January  8  statement  declared  this  year,  the  year  of  the
volunteers for reconstruction and development. Following  this  declaration,
there has been an emergence of movement of volunteers,  and  this  has  been
particularly evident during the period of the reopening of schools.  We  saw
public representatives painting and visiting schools because  they  need  to
build on this important development and maintain its momentum.

The programme of Parliament has  been  designed  in  a  manner  that  allows
public representatives to spend more time  with  their  constituencies.  The
Vuk'uzenzele campaign challenges all of us to work amongst  our  people  and
to provide much-needed leadership to the  constituencies  we  represent,  to
rejuvenate the spirit of volunteerism and mobilise our people to be part  of
this campaign.

This  year  we  need  to  focus  our  energies  on,  one,  doing  our  work,
particularly constituency work; two, informing  our  constituencies  of  the
work in progress in Parliament and in Government; and, three,  listening  to
the concerns of  the  people  and  ensuring  that  these  are  presented  in
Parliament.

 We are mindful of the fact that our strong and  stable  democracy  requires
that we work with our neighbouring  countries  for  the  reconstruction  and
development of the region, in order for our own democracy to be stable.
Parliament has over the years developed an  international  relations  policy
which  is  underpinned  by  the  spirit  of  world  peace,   democracy   and
development. We have developed strategic partnerships  with  parliaments  in
the region and continent, so that we together exchange ideas, based  on  our
experiences, to strengthen our democracy and development.

It is for that reason that the Parliament of the Republic of  South  Africa,
with the permission of the presiding officer in this House, will be  sending
a multiparty delegation to Zimbabwe to oversee  the  Presidential  elections
in that country. We hope that our presence,  together  with  that  of  other
international  observer  missions,  will  contribute  to  the  creation   of
condusive conditions for the people of Zimbabwe  to  elect  a  President  of
their choice.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, we meet in this  Parliament  in
very sombre times. The DA offer our condolences to grieving families of  the
25 victims of the accidents in Kwazulu-Natal last Tuesday.

Siyabakhumbula  kakhulu   labo   bantu   abashonelwe   engozini   yezitimela
kwaDukuza. [We deeply regret the passing away of the people who died in  the
train accident at Stanger.]

Ons dink ook aan die duisende Suid-Afrikaners wat desperaat voel  as  gevolg
van die Saambou-debakel.  Hierdie  Parlement  moet  aan  hierdie  twee  sake
dringende aandag gee. [We also think of the thousands of South Africans  who
are desperate as a result of the Saambou debacle. This Parliament  must  pay
urgent attention to these two issues.]

Let me also wish the President well for  recovering  so  speedily  from  his
accident yesterday ... [Interjections] ... and let me straightaway give  him
credit for his Government's achievements, notably the  provision  of  water,
electricity and housing to several  million  poor  people.  Any  success  in
alleviating poverty and advancing democracy will always receive the  support
and congratulations of the DA. For the achievements the President stated  on
Friday, he has our support.

But if the Government is to get the credit for its successes, then  it  must
also take responsibility for its failures. Regrettably,  the  Government  is
failing the people  on  the  biggest  challenges  of  our  times:  advancing
democracy, building  prosperity,  providing  security,  combating  Aids  and
creating opportunity. These  are  the  large  issues,  and  too  often  they
receive from this Government small answers.

Friday's  address  to  this  House,  whatever  its  other  merits,  left  me
convinced that we exist in two realities. In the President's reality, a  GDP
growth rate of 2% is acceptable under present  circumstances.  Our  HIV/Aids
programme, he told the World Economic Forum, is among the best in the  world
and that the fight against crime is going as well as can be expected.

In the Presidents reality  we  need,  I  quote:  ``...  Only  build  on  the
foundation which has been laid.''
In the President's reality many  of  our  problems  are  best  explained  by
``carefully  cultivated  pessimism  and  despair''.  As  if  all  our  major
problems were matters of perception. But once the President decides that  it
is about perceptions or prejudice, then  the  game  is  all  about  bullying
editors and buying off a  portion  of  the  opposition,  as  indeed  he  has
already done.

But still the problems remain, and the problems cry out for  resolution.  It
is not a matter  of  perception  that  unemployment  is  up  and  growth  is
dangerously down, that Aids is killing the nation, that  crime  is  rampant,
that Zimbabwe is collapsing and that our currency is in  crisis.  These  are
all hard facts and they proceed from other equally hard facts.

And the hardest fact of  all  is  that  by  its  own  promise,  and  by  the
expectations of our people, Government is a long way  off  course.  That  is
the people's reality, a reality of facts with immediate,  tangible,  painful
human consequences. And I regard it as our duty, I would like to say to  the
President, to articulate that reality in this House.

 The President quoted on Friday, and it is his good and great  right  to  do
so, from a very praiseworthy study by the University of Stellenbosch on  the
current performance of Government. But the other  reality  of  our  economic
situation was bluntly articulated last year by the  Centre  for  Development
and Enterprise, another think-tank, in the following way:


  The implications for the expected rate of economic growth ...

And it was then projected at 3,5% GDP -


  ... comes close to being a national disaster. The  simple  fact  is  that
  unless we are able to achieve 5% to 6% growth per year sustained  over  a
  long period, we are not going  to  be  able  to  reduce  the  backlog  of
  unemployment and poverty in South Africa.

Now, against the currently projected  growth  of  2%,  a  national  disaster
becomes a people's tragedy. The President,  on  Friday,  drew  attention  to
certain statistics.  As  is  his  good  right,  he  took  credit  for  their
achievement.

But let us also discuss some other hard  facts  and  some  other  statistics
that were omitted from Friday's speech.  Since  1998  unemployment  in  this
country has grown conservatively by more than 1 million. From  1994  to  the
year 2000, 174 000 people were murdered in South Africa. More people die  of
Aids in South Africa every week than died  in  the  World  Trade  Centre  on
September 11. South Africa has the highest incidence of rape in  the  world.
The poorest 10% of our people are worse off than they  were  in  1993.  Only
25% of South African households are secure in  their  supply  of  food,  and
that statistic was given to us by the Minister in answer to a question.

Last week's released Global Competitiveness Report 2001-2002 found that  out
of 75 countries, South Africa rated last in maths and  science,  came  third
from the bottom for labour relations and only  71st  for  investment.  Since
1994 the rand has dropped from R3,61 against the dollar to R11,49.  That  is
the reality in terms of which we have to discuss  all  our  plans,  all  our
policies and from which to advance our principles.

Yet in the state-of-the-nation address last week there was a great  measure,
with respect, of wishful thinking. One was  left  with  the  impression,  in
terms of the President's analyis, that with a little tinkering over here,  a
slight adjustment over there, a spot of fine-tuning  somewhere  else  and  a
couple of conferences,  we  will  somehow  succeed  in  turning  that  stark
reality on its head.

If only it were so. But the  truth  is  that  South  Africa  needs  a  bold,
creative, radical programme underpinned by visionary leadership. It  is  far
easier to be critical than it is to be correct, so the  fair  question,  one
that will appeal immensely to the last speaker since it was formulated by  V
I Lenin, is: What is to be done? [Interjections.]

First, we must unchain the  economy.  There  are  a  number  of  steps  that
Government promises to make, does not  make  or  should  make.  May  I  just
suggest some of them? We should privatise  decisively.  The  President  last
year promised privatisation - more spoken of than seen - starting  with  the
Telkom IPO, Denel and Safcol.

The President, two and a half years ago, promised an overhaul of our  labour
legislation. Why are the potential employers not given  reason  to  invest?.
Deregulating the environment is the best thing we could  do  for  small  and
medium-sized business.

The hon the President drew attention to unemployment.  Two  years  ago,  the
Government collected nearly a million rand in the Umsobomvu Fund.  Where  is
it? Why do we not use it for practical job creation programmes,  instead  of
wasting money on a growth and development  fund?  In  the  face  of  massive
poverty and joblessness, we believe that the Government has a duty  to  help
those who cannot help  themselves.  We  therefore  welcome  the  President'a
announcement on Friday  that  higher-than-inflation  increases  in  old  age
pensions and child grants will be given.

But, frankly, that is the beginning of the question and not the end  of  the
problem. That does not go far enough. We proposed - and we will do so  again
in the Budget debate, in a few weeks'  time  -  a  basic  subsistence  grant
which will at least give R110 a month to the desperately poor, to  put  food
on the table. We will elaborate on this mechanism  and  on  the  funding  in
that debate.

 Secondly, we must have a fundamental change on our HIV/Aids policy. It  was
quite extraordinary on Friday that the President displayed a bold and  ready
acceptance  for  the  very  controversial  science  of   dating   primordial
artifacts, such as the exciting find at Blomboskuil. But on the other  hand,
the President resolutely refuses to  accept  the  overwhelming  evidence  of
science and medicine on HIV and Aids.

We keep hearing - and perhaps we are tired  of  hearing  -  about  newspaper
people who have taken to interpreting the President's words, with  the  help
of some selective off-the-record briefings, suggesting to  us  that  despite
appearances, the President has actually changed his stance on  this  crucial
issue. But the signals are entirely mixed. The President and  his  party  as
recently as two weeks ago, in the words of Mr Smuts Ngonyama, said that  the
importation of antiretrovirals into the country could ``open our country  to
biological warfare''. We have heard it all before and  frankly,  we  do  not
believe it anymore.

If in fact there is a change in policy, why cannot the President say  so  in
a manner that is straightforward and intelligent? Why on  this  unbelievably
life and death matter, this  war  that  is  devouring  our  nation  and  the
children of South Africa, do we have to be Kremlinologists to  read  between
the lines or to study tea leaves? For  example  it  is  incomprehensible  to
infer that there has been a  policy  u-turn  on  mother-to-child  programmes
when the Government itself is undergoing an appeal against the court  ruling
in favour of the provision of Nevirapine to  HIV  positive  pregnant  women.
What we need is an unequivical, unambiguous and  urgent  statement  that  as
matter of fact, not a matter of assumption, HIV does cause Aids.  That  must
be the foundation of the programme. In addition, there is a  whole  host  of
things that should be done, can be done and presumably, must be done.

Provide antiretrovirals to all pregnant women with HIV - and may I say  that
this was first mooted in this Parliament by this party as long ago  as  June
1999. Provide all  rape  survivors  with  access  to  antiretrovirals  where
indicated. Expand our antiretroviral provision incrementally  from  there  -
it should  not  just  stop  there!  The  programme  should  start  with  all
children. There are many children dying in our hospital of Aids who are  not
babies. We need to expand and roll out the programme to them.

Thirdly, we must revolutionise our approach to combating  crime.  We  simply
cannot allow Government to become anaethetised  to  the  levels  of  violent
crime that plague our people, including the  horrendous  incidence  of  baby
rape.

Die DA het in die afgelope jaar verskeie stukke  privaat  ledewetgewing  oor
misdaad  op  die  Tafel  geplaas.   Verskeie   beleidsinisiatiewe   is   ook
aangekondig wat hier in die Wes-Kaap toegepas is. Ons sal egter weer  tydens
die begrotingsdebatte daaraan aandag gee. [In the past year  various  pieces
of private members' legislation  on  crime  have  been  tabled  by  the  DA.
Various policy initiatives were also announced which were  implemented  here
in the Western Cape. We shall, however, pay attention to these again  during
the budget debates.]

But there is one concrete proposal that I will make here  today.  Scrap  the
next round of the arms procurement deal  and  spend  the  money  instead  on
strengthening our criminal  justice  system.  [Applause.]  Dr  Delport  will
elaborate on this point later today.

Given the reality of our situation, how is it  that  Government  can  afford
R60 billion in armaments against an imaginary foreign enemy, when it  cannot
afford to fight the real enemy in our midst, namely the criminal.

Fourthly, we must put our policy on  Zimbabwe  -  which  is  having  such  a
massive effect on our international investment situation and  positioning  -
right side up by turning  our  face  against  the  profound  wrongs  of  the
government in Harare. Let me immediately say that I am ...

An HON MEMBER: What about Israel?

The LEADER OF THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION: It was not a member of  SADC  when  I
last checked! Maybe you would like to make it a member.

I am glad to see that on Friday  the  President  said  that  the  people  of
Zimbabwe had to be allowed to choose their own future. That statement,  with
respect, was far more explicit than anything the  President  has  ever  said
before, and it was  far  better  than  his  silence,  for  example,  on  the
question of Swaziland. But  with  respect,  that  was  a  statement  of  the
obvious. Although he made his statement at 11:30 am South African  time,  in
terms of the evolving catastrophe next door it was  about  five  minutes  to
midnight.

 Frankly, our vague, ineffective, quiet-diplomacy policy has contributed  to
the current disastrous state of affairs in Zimbabwe. The  silence  where  we
needed plain speaking does not lend support to Nepad, but gives  comfort  to
the rights-delinquent government of Zimbabwe. Simply take  a  look  at  this
headline in The Herald newspaper of last month:


  ``I won't dump Zim'', Mbeki pledges support -  move  deals  opposition  a
  blow.

That is how our policy is being interpreted in Harare. [Interjections.]

Over the past two years the President has too  often  backed  Mr  Mugabe  or
remained silent when he should have spoken out. He has offered him  economic
aid. Consistently this Government has overlooked the murders, the  tortures,
the rapes, the bombing of newspapers and the harassment of  judges.  It  has
looked  the  other  way  when  journalists  were  hounded,  intimidated  and
expelled, or when MPs were harassed and arrested. It has turned a blind  eye
when farmers were killed and chased off their land, when tens  of  thousands
of farmworkers suffered mass beatings, kidnapping and some even death.

Now the President says that the  people  of  Zimbabwe  must  be  allowed  to
choose. Fine. Then the next question is how we will act to help ensure  that
the people of Zimbabwe will be given the free choice that  is  their  right,
because that then becomes the only question.

Die President  moet  in  besonderhede  uitspel  watter  kriteria  die  Suid-
Afrikaanse regering gaan toepas en op watter  gronde  hulle  die  verkiesing
vry en regverdig gaan verklaar. Die  gevolge  wat  die  Mugabe-regering  sal
moet dra, indien daar nie aan die vereistes voldoen word nie, moet deur  die
President uitgespel word. [The President must  spell  out  in  detail  which
criteria the South African Government is going to apply and on what  grounds
they are going to declare the  election  free  and  fair.  The  consequences
which the Mugabe government will have to bear, if the preconditions are  not
met, must be spelt out by the President.]

And of all the great challenges and policy failures I have  outlined  today,
I believe that the one that contributes  most  to  the  underlying  lack  of
confidence in our  current  situation  is  not  so  much  a  policy  but  an
attitude.

Our politics is too much characterised by the ANC's  obsessive  accumulation
of power in its self-confessed attempt  to  extend  its  hegemony  over  the
state and all of civil society. There is  insufficient  distinction  between
democracy on the one hand and power on the other. The  ANC  sees  itself  as
the organic expression of the will of the people, a vanguard  party  of  the
black majority. And so it is  that  we  sit  with  a  very,  very  dangerous
agenda. [Interjections.]

Let me tell members something about the tendency. The hon Chief  Whip  spoke
about counter-revolutionary elements. Let us see  what  Mr  Gwede  Mantashe,
secretary-general of the National Union of Mineworkers, said as recently  as
the  ANC's  90th  anniversary  celebration.  Maybe  he  too  is  a  counter-
revolutionary. He wrote:


  The error that we have to  avoid  is  to  give  the  liberation  movement
  absolute trust, absolute power and an absolute  mandate.  The  result  of
  this is the emergence of dictatorships. This leads  to  people  repeating
  verbatim what the centre of power says. The  long-term  effects  are  the
  death of open debate and the muzzling of analytical minds.

I believe that if one looks back at the arms deal,  for  example,  one  sees
the worst elements of that dangerous tendency. [Interjections.]

Let me conclude with a few words about the opposition. First,  no  democracy
can flourish without an opposition, an opposition which  is  principled  ...
[Interjections.] Members are just shouting down the currency.  No  democracy
can  flourish  without  an  opposition  which  is  principled,  vibrant  and
nationwide in reach and range, an opposition which is chosen by  the  voters
and not by the Government. [Interjections.] No country is a  democracy  when
its people cannot choose an alternative government. The Democratic  Alliance
is that opposition and the core of that alternative. [Interjections.]

Second, we all make  mistakes.  Certainly,  I  made  a  few  last  year  ...
[Interjections.] And you just  inherited  my  biggest  mistake,  Trevor  ...
[Applause.] But I hope I am always ready to admit them and put the  good  of
our country before my own prejudices and ego.

 Third, I commit the DA not just to oppose this  Government's  failings  but
to always offering  alternative  solutions  to  the  problems  we  all  face
together.

Fourth, I commit the DA to  always  seeking  that  which  is  best  for  our
country and our people.

We will continue to do everything in our power to build  South  Africa  from
the opposition benches.

Fifth, we will work with others to harness the goodwill which, for  example,
the Minister of Home Affairs advences so well into a peaceful revolution  of
principled and pragmatic change.

Finally, we believe passionately that there is a  better  future  out  there
for our country and her people. However stormy our present may  be,  we  see
beyond the rainbow to the security and prosperity  that  lie  on  the  other
side. That great future is our goal. To reach it is our life's work. I  hope
most sincerely that towards this end, however we differ on  means,  everyone
here and all the people up there who are represented  here  may  be  united.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, Your Excellency the  President,
Your Excellency the Deputy President and hon  members,  this  year's  debate
has forced my party and me into some kind of soul-searching. We  have  heard
the President's state of the nation address, and there is a lot in  it  with
which we totally agree. Yet we have different opinions in  respect  of  some
of the things that he said, and some of those  which  he  ommitted  to  say.
This  is  not  the  first  time  that  we  as  a  distinct  political  party
participating  in  President  Mbeki's  Cabinet  find  ourselves  in  such  a
situation.

This year there are forceful considerations prompting us to  emphasise  both
the points of similarity and those of  difference.  By  doing  so,  we  will
strengthen our country's governance, and also the course of democracy.

Before I do so, I must remind myself and some of my colleagues why my  party
and I have accepted to serve in President Mbeki's Cabinet. We have not  done
it for our own personal sake, but because we seek to  reconcile  our  people
who have been divided by brutal low-intensity civil war of  about  20  years
which killed no less that 20 000 thousand people. By showing  how  President
Mbeki and I can work hand in hand at the highest levels of  Government,  our
people on the ground may find it in their hearts  to  reconcile  with  those
who were once their enemies.

Conflicts at grass-roots level are of an intensity beyond the  understanding
of people with an ordinary secure and stable life. People need to  reconcile
with those who kill their family members and grow to regard  them  not  only
as no longer enemies, but as brothers and sisters with whom  to  join  hands
in the common work of reconstruction and development.

For this reason, His Excellency President Mbeki and  I  had  to  project  an
image of unity and solidarity, and give an example  of  how  people  can  in
fact, in spite of differences, work together. For this reason, for the  past
five years in my public addresses I have stressed the call for  unity  above
and beyond any differences. For this reason, I have  remained  committed  to
the course of reconciliation and to unity at all costs. Only those who  have
witnessed the horrors of war may fully appreciate how  true  reconciliation,
which goes deep in the hearts and minds of our  people,  is  more  important
than  any  political  or  policy  differentiation  which  one  may  wish  to
highlight, to promote a well-functioning democracy.

I remain committed to being a promoter of unity among all  members  of  this
House and their respective views and opinions. Our unity is  more  important
than right and wrong on marginal issues of policy or governance, because  we
have not yet reached a point where the  foundations  of  our  democracy  are
solid enough to withstand old fractures. We also need  more  unity  to  heal
new fractures in our democracy, which are showing in  the  debates  of  this
House.

We must unify this House in a  common  national  cause  and  respect  people
across both sides of the isle.

Our Cabinet participation has also been motivated by our  desire  to  enable
our constituency to receive the recognition it deserves in  the  history  of
the liberation struggle. This is not a Buthelezi  issue,  but  one  that  is
about millions of people who followed  me  and  their  contribution  to  our
struggle for liberation, which has been obliterated from the record  of  our
history by violent propaganda  and  vilification  against  me.  After  seven
years in the Government of the country, no steps  have  yet  been  taken  to
address the legacy of lies used against me and my constituency to  undermine
our contribution to the liberation struggle.

 We have had setbacks on this  pilgrimage  and  this  long  journey  to  our
destination of reconciliation and peace  in  our  country.  I  was  terribly
hurt, for example, when the Indian community in Chartsworth invited me  last
year to attend the birthday of His Excellency former  President  Mandela  in
Chartsworth. The top leadership of the ANC  in  the  province  was  present,
apart from the fact that our icon former President Mandela was  there.  When
it was my turn to speak, supporters of the ANC tried to  drown  what  I  was
saying by singing songs. Doc Mkhize got up and tried to stop  that,  but  he
did not succeed, to the extent that when it  was  time  to  speak,  for  His
excellency former President Mandela, he had to detract from  his  speech  to
and tell them where he and  I  come  from  and  the  long  journey  that  we
travelled together in the liberation struggle.

Those are  setbacks  which  indicate  that  we  have  not  yet  reached  our
destination.

I was very impressed by a quote, and I wish that some of  the  presentations
that we as Cabinet attend from time to time given by the  police,  could  be
attended by members of this House, because the figures that were  quoted  by
the President, for example, are from the  places  where  crime  is  highest.
More than half of the crime has been  reduced.  I  know  that  this  is  not
visible to  most  people,  but  I  wish  it  was  so.  When  one  gets  that
comprehensive presentation from the police one  does  not  get  to  see  it,
because it is not visible to all and sundry.  However,  there  has  been  an
improvement as far as our reduction of crime is concerned.

Having said so, I must say that I have a problem with our  criminal  justice
system itself. For example, on 23 June 2000,  my  Deputy  in  the  Buthelezi
area was shot at with AK-47  in  his  bed.  Fortunately,  he  did  not  die.
Suspects were arrested. But up to this day, the matter has not  come  before
a court. Certainly, one of the things that indicate that in  our  quest  for
reconciliation and peace we still have a long way  to  our  destination,  is
the high profile case of the Mayor  of  Nongoma,  in  which  names  of  high
profile leaders in the province were mentioned  and  in  which  existed  not
only  circumstancial  evidence,  but  also  evidence  given  by  people  who
actually saw with their own eyes the people who shot at the mayor. Yet  that
case came to nothing.

I have a very high regard for our director of prosecutions,  and  I  do  not
think he would have idly decided to take the matter before court if  he  had
not been convinced that there was, infact a case.

I have seen, first hand, the untold suffering  of  those  who  followed  me,
many of whom paid the ultimate sacrifice. In  Vosloorus  our  candidate,  Mr
Justice Hadebe, was assassinated  during  the  local  government  elections.
Suspects were arrested, but up to now that case  has  never  come  before  a
court. I know that, had we not acted  the  way  we  did  and  stood  by  the
principles that  we  have,  our  struggle  for  liberation  would  not  have
succeeded and perhaps South Africa would have been turned into  a  wasteland
in a bloodbath.

Through our unity, their contribution must  be  recognised.  Yet  this  year
there are certain foundational issues in respect of which my conscience  and
my constituency force me to highlight differences. As I do so I am  reminded
of past seasons in which I also highlighted fundamental differences with  my
colleagues in our liberation struggle which caused an entire armed  struggle
and a campaign of vilification directed toward me and  my  constituency.  At
the time I kept insisting that our liberation struggle had  to  receive  the
benefit of  different  approaches  in  a  multipronged  and  composite-level
strategy.

I did not condemn the ANC for its call for an armed struggle. In fact,  when
the hon the President, in the company of the late Mr Dlomo, came to  see  me
at Heathrow Airport, he raised this issue  that  the  movement  that  I  was
working with in South Africa, the ANC, was troubled by the fact that  I  did
not support the armed struggle. The hon the President may  remember  that  I
actually said, on that occasion that I would go very far as someone  in  the
country because I had never condemned the struggle. I have always said  that
I espoused nonviolent strategies  of  the  old  ANC  as  propounded  by  the
founding fathers of the ANC in 1912. But I  went  on  to  say  that  as  the
government had banned the ANC, the PAC  and  silenced  the  leaders  of  our
people, I could well understand why the ANC had taken up arms.

 However, I claimed my constituency's right  to  pursue  the  same  goal  of
liberation through a different path. I affirmed  the  fundamental  principle
of pluralism, which is now, importantly, perhaps more in  jeopardy  than  it
was  then.  If  our  democracies  should   succeed,   we   need   to   allow
differentiated approaches and a plurality of voices not only  to  be  heard,
but also listened to and respected.

I have listened to the President's state of the nation  address  and,  as  I
have said already, I am at one with the  President  in  the  goals  that  he
outlined. We share a vision. We share hopes and aspirations in the same  way
that, 20 years ago, Dr Oliver  Tambo  and  I  shared  a  vision,  hopes  and
aspirations in respect of our liberation struggle. However,  my  reading  of
the present situation and of the state  of  the  nation  is  less  rosy  and
positive than the President has portrayed to us. It might be the  case  that
he may be seeing a glass half-full, which I perceive to be half-empty.

However, as I come from communities where people are  dying  from  Hiv/Aids,
as well as the  consequences  of  unemployment  and  poverty,  I  cannot  be
satisfied with what we  have  achieved,  great  as  it  is.  I  must  wonder
whether, in addition  to  the  many  right  things  that  we  have  done  as
government, we have not erred in other  respects.  After  all,  humanum  est
errare, to err is human.

I feel I must focus on our errors and, if necessary, take it upon myself  to
say that we have erred. I am not pointing fingers. If indeed we have  erred,
let the blame be so apportioned that  I  too,  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi,  shall
carry that blame. But, in God's name, let  us  recognise  our  mistakes  and
correct them as soon as we can before our people pay too dire  a  price  for
them.

In exercising a necessary dose of self-criticism, we must  open  our  hearts
to conflicting views.

I am concerned, Madam Speaker, by the divisions in this House.  I  see  that
after your workshop, there is a slight improvement in the behaviour of  your
members. I will say openly that, at times, I also  have  problems  with  the
way members hackle members of other parties.

I also say openly that, at times, I also have  problems  with  the  way  the
Leader of the Opposition expresses himself and the nature of his attacks  on
Government. At times he is not sufficiently sensitive about  the  collective
psychology of the majority of South Africans, who have been talked  down  to
for centuries. It may well  be  a  cultural  thing  which  he  is  not  even
conscious of. It may also be a question of an age gap between  me  and  him.
[Laughter.]

Our fledgeling democracy is not yet ready for the type of with  and  tongue-
lashing  which  characterises  political  debates  in  old  and  established
democracies.

At times I have felt aggrieved by his apparent abrasiveness, even though  it
was not directed towards me. But we must realise that  his  abrasiveness  is
the product of a high intellect and the spirited passion of a  true  patriot
- which he is who means well. [Applause.]

I am very concerned that at times what the Leader of the Opposition  has  to
say is not heard, because of the way he goes about saying it.  I  will  make
an example by comparing this something that happened when I  was  a  student
at Fort Hare. Recently in a speech the hon  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition
made, he referred to people in the ANC who have developed potbellies.  Well,
I may well have said the same thing, but in a different way.

It reminded me of the time when we used to read The  Torch  as  students  at
Fort Hare, when Bennie Keys was still there. I  remember  Rev  Skomolo,  who
was the champion of the ANC in  Port  Elizabeth,  delivering  a  very  fiery
address and The Torch reporting the address. Our  ANC  leader  in  the  Cape
Province was Prof Matthews, the father of the Deputy Minister here.  Because
he was sitting there and had not left  the  Native  Representative  Council,
The Torch reported that Rev Skomolo had delivered a very fiery address,  but
had forgotten that on the same platform from which he  was  speaking,  there
were those who had developed potbellies from crumbs  that  had  fallen  from
Pharo's table. [Laughter.]

 That is the kind of expression that I am referring to,  ie  the  fact  that
one can say the same thing in different words. I  think  we  must  learn  to
listen to the Leader of the Opposition and anyone else  including  even  our
enfant  terrible,  Patricia  de  Lille.  [Laughter.]  We  need  to  build  a
democracy based on a plurality of viewpoints in this House.

Against this background I need to consider my own position. I have  been  in
government for 40 years, and in politics  all  my  life.  I  did  not  enter
politics because of my ambition, but was forced to do so  by  circumstances.
I was forced by my birth as Inkosi, by my mother and by the leaders  of  the
ANC. I responded to pressures placed on me by the aspirations of my  people.
The same aspirations are likely to force me to  remain  in  politics  for  a
long time, and it may be the case that my destiny is not  yet  accomplished.
Yet I have no ambition of my own, nor is there anything  else  that  someone
in my position can really aspire to.

I see my role as that of an honest man amongst all of you, who  is  beholden
to no one, expects nothing and fears even less. I am free, and feel  that  I
must speak to all of you from all the parties from my heart, and share  with
you that I see our nation being  in  a  very  precarious  state.  Unless  we
identify the things which are going wrong, our analysis of the state of  the
nation will continue to focus on the  half-full  glass.  We  must  hear  the
voice of those who are suffering because things are not  going  the  way  we
wished, and start from there.

All of us are now affected by HIV/Aids. We all know somebody  who  is  dying
of Aids, or somebody close to us who knows someone in  that  condition.  Our
nation is dying of HIV/Aids. We can no longer hesitate or falter. We can  no
longer wait or debate. This is the time to act in the full  measure  of  our
capacity, leaving no stone unturned. For this  reason,  my  party  gave  our
national chairman, the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal,  the  hon  Lionel  Mtshali,
the firm instruction to order the immediate distribution  of  nevirapine  to
all our HIV-positive pregnant women  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  so  as  to  prevent
their babies from being born with a death sentence. [Applause.]

KwaZulu-Natal  is  the  province  with  the  greatest  percentage   of   HIV
infection, and last year alone 80 000 people died of  Aids-related  diseases
and 40 000 babies were born HIV-positive, condemning them to die a  horrible
death long before puberty. All those children could easily have been  saved.
For this reason my party had to do what it did.

The Premier of KwaZulu-Natal  has  now  instructed  that  henceforth  health
facilities in KwaZulu-Natal shall ensure that children are not born  with  a
death sentence. He went on to a full measure of what can in  fact  be  done,
and instructed that even  in  those  areas  where  testing  and  counselling
cannot take place at this juncture, nevirapine  be  made  available  to  all
mothers, whether they are HIV-positive or not.

As  soon  as  the  logistical  capacity  allows  us  to  test  and   provide
counselling even in such remote areas the distribution  of  Nevirapine  will
finally become limited only to mothers who are proven  to  be  HIV-positive.
But in the interim we cannot wait for months,  if  not  years,  to  have  an
infrastructure which can determine the HIV status of women and provide  them
with the required counselling. As 40% of women giving birth in his  province
are now HIV-positive, Premier Mtshali has correctly treated this  matter  as
the medical emergency that it  is,  and  required  that  where  testing  and
counselling are  not  possible,  nevirapine  be  given  to  all  prospective
mothers, unless a mother chooses to opt out of the  programme  by  producing
an HIV-negative test result or by requesting to be tested in  spite  of  the
lack of counselling capacity. We need this type  of  approach,  which  rolls
out the programme ahead of capacity if we are genuinely committed to  saving
each and every life. We need to do the same with  antiretroviral  drugs  for
mothers and for all those who are HIV-positive.

I am also desperately concerned about unemployment.  The  President  in  his
state of the nation address quoted some  of  the  investments  that  we  are
getting into the country. I was frankly depressed because  I  do  not  think
that much will be done in this  respect  unless  we  realise  that  somehow,
somewhere - I do not know how  -  we  have  erred.  In  many  respects,  the
economic conditions of vast segments of our people is now worse than it  was
10 years ago.  Enormous  progress  has  been  made  in  bringing  water  and
electricity  to  our  people,  and  economic  activities  are  beginning  to
proliferate amongst those who were once excluded from the  productive  cycle
and mainstream economy. We have done well in that respect and I am  sure  we
will be able to do more or better in the future. But we must recognise  that
our record in employment generation is unsatisfactory  and  that  somewhere,
somehow, we must have erred.

 We have the best Minister of Finance this country  has  ever  had,  perhaps
better than most in the world. [Applause.] Our fiscal policy is  better,  it
cannot be compared with  many  in  the  emerging  economies,  yet  I  cannot
understand why is it that in spite of all  that  investors  are  not  coming
into our country. Our economy is reported to be growing only at  a  rate  of
1,1% per year, which makes us one of the slowest growing  economies  in  the
world. According to recent statistics, 21,2% of our population  is  employed
and we have an unemployment rate of 29,5%, which is one of  the  highest  in
the world and could be higher if one broadened the  spectrum  of  those  who
could be considered to be employable.
When I spoke in similar debates in the past I stressed the need  to  develop
a long-term vision, identifying where we wish our country  to  be  25  years
hence, so that we could backtrack  our  actions  to  determine  how  to  get
there. I stressed the need to make massive national investments in  emerging
technologies, identifying new technological  frontiers  to  meet  technology
ahead of its evolution. I impressed the need to  leap-frog  our  country  to
that rendezvous with history by training our people, not only  for  what  is
required of them but also for what should be expected of them in  10  years.
I have also impressed the need to open our  country  to  foreign  skills  so
that we can import not only the foreign financial capital we so  desperately
need, but first and foremost the human capital of required skills which  can
enable our country to progress  towards  its  intended  destination.  I  was
pleased that His Excellency the President stressed the need for a policy  on
training. Against that statement I was very distressed that  my  Immigration
Bill has encountered the  stratagem  that  is  has  encountered  up  to  the
highest level, which has delayed its passing up to now.

I have accompanied this vision with the need to identify the crucial  fields
in which employment can be generated, not in 10 years,  but  yesterday.  The
two  greatest  employment-generating  possibilities  in  our   country   are
agriculture and  tourism.  As  a  Government  we  need  to  support  labour-
intensive agricultural industries which produce  high-added  value  products
and are not land-intensive. Our natural climate is  perfectly  suitable  for
such industry, for which there is a strong international demand.

Tourism is the fastest growing industry in the world and  has  the  capacity
to employ people at all levels, promoting large and small businesses alike.

We must accept that inspite of the many very possible  efforts  our  country
is still not  regarded  by  international  observers  as  tourist  freindly.
Inspite  of  our  efforts  we  were  falterd  in  projecting   our   country
internationally. I want to underline that we were falterd in  projeting  our
country in more ways than one. We should not escape reality  of  the  matter
just because we may like it or rightly regard it to be unfair.

Perceptions are perceptions, no matter how untrue or unfair they may be.  As
hon members know, I have been on the international scene for half a  century
and have highly placed friends throughout the world who convey to  me  their
impressions with candour. These are not people  who  are  enemies  of  South
Africa. The harsh reality is that international perceptions of South  Africa
are now very poor. In all likelihood, this is a contributing factor  to  the
downfall of our national currency, which in less than four weeks cut by  one
third the wealth of international  terms  of  all  our  wealth,  income  and
assets.

We must look into the issue of international perceptions  with  honesty  and
courage, and recognise that somehow something went wrong  and  that  we  may
have erred.

The recently published Global Competitiveness Report produces by  the  World
Economic Forum and Harvard University places our country near the bottom  of
75 countries which they considered. This might be  wrong  in  fact,  but  it
reflects the perception which exists. We are listed  as  one  of  the  worst
countries in the world in terms of orgainsed crime, incompetence  of  public
officials, labour relations, investment rates,  access  to  foreign  capital
markets, flexibility of  the  labour  market,  productivity  and  our  other
salient aspects of our economy.

 We need to change the perception of our country, through  bold  initiatives
which show that we are moving in  a  new  direction,  such  as  getting  our
economy going by bringing about genuine extensive  and  economically  driven
privatisation, not in a matter of years, but in a matter of months.

Let me pause here and  say  that  the  Cabinet  are  jointly  and  severally
responsible. What I am saying about this matter  is  not  oblique  or  vague
critisism of my colleques, the ministers, because I am  jointly  responsible
with all that they have tried to do for our country. I would like to put  it
on record that I know they have done their best. But I know that there is  a
debate in this country as far as privatisation is concerned which  is  them,
which is between the ANC and his partners.

Hon members have heard me harping on this point since 1994, and  they  house
have seen me dancing and singing: Asiyifuni i-Gear,  asiyifuni  i-Gear.  [We
do not want Gear, we do not want Gear] on this poduim  ...  [Laughter.]  and
yet little has been done in recognition of this its  wisdom.  Similarly,  we
need to re-engineer our system of labour relations to create flexibility  in
the labour market, increase productivity  and  create  real  incentives  for
people to seriously undertake  the  training  opportunities  which  are  now
available, as the President stated. Without  this  being  done  the  massive
investment we have made to promote  training  is  in  jeopardy  of  failure,
which would be a national disaster and tragedy.

We also need to take a hard look at our foreign  policy,  across  the  board
which especially at this time in the global history is highly  conducive  to
shaping international perceptions. We  compliment  His  Excellecy  President
Mbeki for his tireless efforts in Africa which have assisted to  solve  many
problems across the continent. However, we have serious back home which  the
world has not failed to notice also.

While it is flattening that everyone in South  Africa  is  looking  for  our
assistance in solving their problems, the world and our people  alike,  know
that we have enormous problems which they expect us to  solve.  It  is  very
good that we have become one of the catalysts of the African Union,  but  we
must accompany our desire to promote  the  unity  of  Africa  with  that  of
promoting democrasy in Africa.

Unity cannot come  before  real  democracy,  and  real  unity  can  only  be
sustained once real democracy and the blessing of a genuinely free and  open
society characterised by genuine pluralism, exist in all African  countries.
We cannot hesitate or falter when it comes to drawing a distinction  between
those countries which are democratic, and those which are not.

We should utilise the same approach in respect of foreign  policy  positions
we take in respect of countries or situations  beyond  the  borders  of  our
continent.

We must show our commitment to democracy by recognising that  our  true  and
genuine partners are those who are as committed as we are to democracy,  and
the for the values of liberty and freedom which we  profess  to  hold  dear.
Whatever regime oppresses its  own  people,  depriving  them  of  the  basic
liberties on which we have established our republic, is  likely  to  operate
on the same basis in respect of its neighbours and foreign countries  alike,
either through oppression, direct war or  forms  of  indirect  war  such  as
terrorism.

This is a time in history where friends and foes are counted, and those  who
try to sit on the fence are rapidly pushed into  the  camp  of  foes.  I  am
committed to the development of South Africa and have no doubt  in  my  mind
that our country belongs in  the  camp  of  countries  which  are  genuinely
committed to democracy and to the  blessing  of  development,  progress  and
prosperity, which come only in a genuinely open and free society.

I would like to tell the hon the President that, when I came out as  it  has
happened to most of us, gangs  surrounded  me.  When  they  ask  me  what  I
thought of the President's speech, I told them that I did not think I  could
have done better in an hour, as he did. [Laughter.] And  I  should  like  to
tell the hon the President that I meant that.

I am saying that this is the time to be united, really united.  Even  if  we
speak with different voices and emphasis. Our country  needs  our  diversity
of opinion  and  a  leadership  capable  of  recognising  its  value,  fully
accommodating it. [Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, it is appropriate that  at  the  mid-
term  state-of-the-nation  address,  we  take  stock  of  the   Government's
achievements  and  failures  during  the  first  half  of  its  term.   More
important, perhaps, is for us to seek  a  real  national  consensus  on  our
approach to the great challenges  facing  South  Africa  including,  amongst
others, poverty, crime, unemployment, homelessness and  HIV/Aids.  The  most
important task facing us is the developing of  a  unity  of  purpose  and  a
constructive dialogue between the different political parties.

The hon President's unequivocal commitment to an open  economy  is  a  vital
element in making South Africa part of the modern global  economy.  This  is
not a theoretical debate; it is about  economic  growth,  job  creation  and
addressing poverty.

We must  continue  to  implement  the  measures  required  to  ensure  rapid
economic growth. We must  create  an  environment  conducive  to  attracting
foreign direct investment, and lay the basis  for  future  economic  growth,
through excellence in education and training. This will require us  to  also
invest more in research and  development,  build  partnerships  in  Southern
Africa and in Africa, further  liberalise  trade,  and  to  make  a  greater
effort to promote entrepreneurship and the development of small, medium  and
micro enterprises.

To take maximum advantage  of  a  global  economy,  regional  political  and
economic stability is vital.

Ons kritiek oor  die  beleid  van  stille  diplomasie  teenoor  die  huidige
Zimbabwiese regering, is bekend. Die aankondiging op Vrydag dat  Suid-Afrika
twee waarnemingspanne gaan stuur, en die verbintenis deur die  regering  dat
slegs die uitslag van 'n vrye en regverdige verkiesing aanvaar sal word,  is
belangrike, positiewe ontwikkelings.

Zimbabwe het vir ons gewys dat daar in die vinnig veranderende  wêreld,  nie
meer wegkruipplek is vir regerings en lande wat onstabiliteit veroorsaak  en
basiese vryhede en regte minag nie. Zimbabwe se  negatiewe  invloed  op  ons
hele streek het opnuut die nuwe interafhanklikheid wat deel is van die  nuwe
wêreld,  beklemtoon.  Die  manier  waarop  die  regering  gaan  bly  by  die
verbintenis wat mnr Mbeki uitgespel het, is 'n  belangrike  element  is  ons
aansien as 'n  leier  op  die  Afrikavasteland.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Our  criticism  of  the  quiet  diplomacy  policy  regarding  the   current
Zimbabwean government is well known. The announcement on Friday  that  South
Africa will be sending two observation teams and  the  commitment  from  the
government that only the outcome  of  a  free  and  fair  election  will  be
accepted, are important, positive developments.

Zimbabwe has shown us that there is no hiding place  in  the  fast  changing
world  for  governments  and  countries  which  cause  instability  and  who
disregard basic freedoms and rights. Zimbabwe's negative  influence  on  our
entire region has once again emphasised the new interdependence which  forms
part of this new world. The way in which the government will stay  committed
to what Mr Mbeki has spelled out is an  important  element  in  how  we  are
perceived as a leader on the African continent.
Much has been said, written and invented about  the  agreement  between  the
New NP and the ANC. Some say it will make  a  much  needed  contribution  to
ensure that we finally leave the trenches of the  past  behind;  others  say
that it is nothing less than a political evil.

When  the  ANC  was  unbanned  in  1990,  the  inevitable  happened.  People
supporting the ANC ran to one corner, and those not supporting the  ANC  ran
to other corners. The party-political dispensation  after  1994  was  really
only a perpetuation of the divisions that  we  had  before  1990.  As  South
Africans, we never really had the opportunity to sit  together,  to  get  to
know each other and to determine who belongs with whom.

I and many others never had the opportunity to work with a Zola Skweyiya,  a
Trevor  Manuel,  a  Terror  Lekota,  a  Ben  Ngubane  and  vice  versa.  The
Government of National Unity, between 1994 and 1996 was too  early  and  too
forced to really provide that opportunity. Instead of jointly accepting  the
challenges of the new South Africa, the GNU was perceived to be  more  of  a
balancing act between old South Africa and new South Africa interests.

 It makes no sense to start a new South Africa with a  new  Constitution  if
the old division simply continues. The truth  is,  the  challenges  are  now
different. In all the analyses of Zimbabwe,  people  are  missing  one  very
important point: What would Zimbabwe have been like  if,  soon  after  their
independence, there had been white leaders with courage and  conviction  who
stood up to take the hands of black leaders, and black leaders who  did  the
same? Instead, in  Zimbabwe  white  leaders  chose  to  demonise  the  black
leadership, and black leaders chose to demonise the  white  leadership.  The
result, the ongoing racial tension, is there for everybody to see. What  the
New NP and ANC have done will forever change the older visions.  [Applause.]


In the ranks of the minority communities, our decision has caused  a  heated
debate and a lot of uncertainty. [Interjections.] I will deal with you  now,
just be patient! [Laughter.] What people have been  brought  up  with,  what
they have been taught to fear, they are now urged to accept,  to  work  with
and to respect.

I fully recognise that it may be exactly the same in some  quarters  of  the
ANC  alliance,  but  it  is  better  to  provide  hope   than   to   promote
hopelessness. The hard and uncomfortable  truth  is  that  the  relationship
between the minority communities and the black majority in our  country  is,
to a large extent, based on fear. Sometimes that fear  manifests  itself  in
withdrawal, in denial; sometimes in arrogance,  or  in  simply  leaving  the
country. [Laughter.]

There are those who do not regard old fears and distrust as  something  that
should be replaced by mutual trust and respect. They regard  fear  as  their
only political lifeline to exploit, to fuel and to inflame.

In a DP/DA  pamphlet  distributed  over  the  past  few  days,  they  use  a
comparison between South Africa and Zimbabwe to say that they - heaven  help
us - will help to ensure  that  critics  of  this  Government  will  not  be
suppressed, tortured or murdered.

Of course we have differences in our political life, which is as  it  should
be. But to fuel fears by outright fear-mongering in  an  extreme  sense,  is
wrong and irresponsible. [Applause.] Our  challenge  is  to  strengthen  the
stable centre and, yes, people all over the spectrum who were  opponents  in
the past are forming new partnerships. The  ANC  and  the  New  NP  are  one
example. But on the right-hand  side  of  the  political  spectrum,  certain
liberals and rightwingers are increasingly finding solace  in  each  other's
arms. [Applause.]

Verkramptheid in English is just  as  bad  as  verkramptheid  in  Afrikaans.
There is no difference: verkramptheid  is  verkramptheid  in  any  language.
[Interjections.] The moment the leadership of a  party  starts  to  advocate
``What is bad for the country is good for the  DA'',  the  question  arises:
How should we judge them as patriotic South  Africans?  How  do  they  judge
themselves? [Interjections.] I know for a fact that  there  are  individuals
in the DP/DA who are extremely uncomfortable with that  lack  of  commitment
to this country. [Interjections.] The New NP and I have had to  endure  many
vicious attacks from the DP/DA over the last few  months  and  from  certain
outside interests sympathetic to  their  cause,  their  approach  and  their
style.

Let me put on record, once and for all, the following:  Firstly,  the  DP/DA
says that they are a principled opposition. Let us see how  principled  they
are. [Interjections.] The people that have abused in are starting  to  cheer
me! something is wrong out there! [Applause.]

When the Mpumalanga Premier was criticised, quite  rightly,  for  his  well-
known remark that it was justified for politicians  to  sometimes  lie,  the
DP/DA could not contain their glee and  set  the  following  standard  in  a
speech in this Parliament by the DP leader, and I quote:


  Hon members must not expect the opposition to  stand  by  and  allow  our
  President to condemn dishonesty but then to condone lies;  or  to  preach
  probity and yet reward criminal  conduct.  What  we  require  is  strong,
  determined and honourable leadership.

Last year when the then  Premier  of  the  Western  Cape  -  now  the  DP/DA
provincial leader - changed his mind four times in three days  on  where  he
stands on the NNP-ANC agreement, and later admitted in his  own  words  that
he stretched the truth, the DP/DA leader came out actively him, saying  that
he had been extreme duress from his party's  national  leaders  to  two  the
party line. [Applause.]

What  happened  to  principled  opposition?  Double  standards  are   double
standards.

Secondly, the DP/DA is always telling anyone who is willing to  listen  that
they are the party of the rule of law. The treatment  of  Mr  Peter  Marais,
now the Premier of the Western Cape, by the leadership of the DP/DA,  ripped
the mask off that party. The High  Court  made  some  scathing  observations
with regard to the conduct of the DP/DA leadership:
  The  conduct  of  the  DA's  NNC  was  under  the  circumstances  unjust,
  inequitable and unreasonable.

I said it then and I want to repeat it now. If one,  as  a  leader,  is  not
willing to stand up for one person being treated unfairly, one can never  be
trusted  to  stand  up  when  many  people  are  being   treated   unfairly.
[Applause.] One cannot criticise President Mugabe for undermining  the  rule
of law, when one is oneself doing exactly the same in  one's  own  political
party. [Applause.] The high-handed manner, the arrogant  way  in  which  the
leadership of the DP/DA dealt  with  Peter  Marais  and  other  individuals,
reminds me of what Cecil John Rhodes once said about his  relationship  with
Cape Afrikaners in the late 1800s:


  They are not my friends. They are not my enemies. They are my  tools  and
  when I am finished with them, I throw them away.

Thirdly, the DP/DA is a  party  of  hypocrisy,  spin  doctoring  and  window
dressing. What they say to the people of South Africa differs  greatly  from
what they admit to themselves. In a confidential internal strategy  document
circulated in January this year, provided to us by members of their  caucus,
the DA undertook a postmortem process of  soul-searching  which  revealed  a
massive gap between what the party tells the public and what they  admit  to
themselves. [Interjections.] In last  week's  DA  pamphlet,  they  tell  the
public that they will win the  Western  Cape,  but  in  their  own  internal
document they acknowledge that and I quote:


  The ANC and the New NP together are likely to have more than 50%  of  the
  support in the Western Cape and the Northern Cape.

On 7 December 2001, the leader of the DP/DA said the following:


  The DA is today a party united for the first time since its inception  in
  June last year.

Yet in January 2002, in their  own  internal  document,  they  admitted  the
opposite:
  The events of  the  past  year  have  caused  suspicion,  resentment  and
  conflict between people in the DA. It manifests itself in  off-the-record
  sniping to journalists and an unusually high degree of negative gossiping
  inside the party. [Interjections.]

I  could  go  on  and  quote  the  DA's  internal  document  on   consulting
professionals in the field to develop a shared organisational  culture,  and
the cultural clashes in their party. But  I  do  not  know  if  there  is  a
psychologist who is paid enough to  take  on  this  assignment.  [Laughter.]
First they tried the lawyers and that failed and now  they  are  trying  the
psychologists.

Fourthly, the arrogance and self-righteousness of  the  DP/DA  destroys  the
valuable contribution that some individuals in the DP/DA can make.

Today we all had to witness here, again,  how  we  are  lectured  about  the
requirements for good and stable government. [Interjections.] But  the  very
same party lecturing us is the first party in history that I  know  of  that
caused a government  to  fall  because  of  two  street  names!  [Applause.]
[Laughter.]

For many decades - very unfairly, I have to say to our friends in the IFP  -
the old province  of  Natal,  before  it  became  KwaZulu-Natal,  was  often
jokingly referred to  as  the  last  colonial  outpost.  The  last  colonial
outpost is not a province of this country; it is a  political  party  -  the
DP/DA. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

In conclusion, the challenges in our country are immense, but so too is  the
willingness to form new partnerships to overcome these challenges. We  South
Africans have a unique characteristic. Where other people would simply  give
up, we open new frontiers.  Where  other  people  would  retreat  back  into
laagers, we seek new horisons. Where other nations would  allow  differences
to  tear  them  apart,  we  unite  our  nation  around  common   challenges.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Order!
The MINISTER OF SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Madam  Speaker,  Comrade  President,
Comrade Deputy President, hon members, I must thank the  hon  Marthinus  Van
Schalkwyk  for  successfully  burying  the  hon   Tony   Leon.   [Applause.]
[Laughter.] And, I  am  sure  the  crowd  that  they  had  rented  for  this
afternoon will be beginning to trickle back into their  buses  to  go  home.
[Laughter.]

The President's state-of-the-nation address  is  a  comprehensive  statement
about everything that is of national interest in our country today  and  how
we position ourselves in relation to  key  strategic  interventions  in  the
continent. It is a statement that refuses merely to cite  an  issue  without
indicating what the Government  and  relevant  stakeholders  are  doing  and
intend to do in relation to all the matters that have been  prioritised  for
attention. The widespread  applause  that  it  has  received  all  over  the
country confirms the fact  that  the  issues  canvassed  are  real  and  the
solutions proffered, explicit.

But, there are political parties such as the PAC  of  Azania,  the  DA,  the
ACDP and the UDM which are at pains to find  fault  with  the  statement  in
order to justify their missed-opportunity prattle.

Cosatu remains an ally of the ANC. Similarly the SA  Communist  Party.  When
we talk of an alliance, we are  talking  about  components  that  constitute
that alliance - not the confusion that is characteristic of the  left  here.
[Interjections.] Two parties were supposed to have merged,  but  they  still
refer  to  themselves  as  an  alliance;  who  is  the   alliance   between?
[Laughter.] That is why there is this great confusion around them.

The state of the nation address is not regarded by the President, his  party
and the vast masses of our people as a  window  of  opportunity,  like  they
want to suggest, to jettison this position in order  to  embrace  the  other
one and look good in the eyes of charlatans and political opportunists.

The issues raised in the address  are  serious  matters  that  cry  out  for
serious attention and solutions. That is why the President has indicated  in
very precise terms,  what  we  shall  be  doing  in  respect  of  all  them,
including Zimbabwe, HIV/Aids and crime.

Another expression of this brand of political delinquency is  found  in  the
statement of the hon Patricia de  Lille,  which  she  is  lamenting  on  the
President's imaginary course to ``white academics in  Stellenbosch''  for  a
score card of Government's performance, even though the President makes  the
point abundantly clear that we received an unsolicited report  from  a  team
of academics. ``Unsolicited'' does not make any sense in  the  mind  of  the
hon member Patricia de Lille. [Interjections.]

The political positions taken by these parties are not accidental  slips  of
the  tongue.  On  the  contrary,  they  are  a  characteristic  trait  of  a
leadership that has arrogated to itself the status of fault-finding  zealots
totally  removed  from  the  processes   of   change   and   transformation,
reconstruction and development. Unfortunately for us and millions  of  South
Africans who have applauded the  state  of  the  nation  address,  there  is
nothing we can do to correct what shows  itself  as  essentially  a  factory
fault. There is nothing we can do about it. [Applause.]

The point that Shenge made about unity in  this  House  is  very  much  well
taken. It is a point that time and again he makes in Cabinet and  in  public
meetings. He is concerned about  the  unity  beyond  the  confines  of  this
Chamber. These are the concerns that time and  again  he  would  make  as  a
responsible leader of our people.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: [Inaudible.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: What makes Shenge the  adorable  leader
that he is the man that we would continue  to  respect,  regardless  of  the
fact that he belongs to a different party - is Shenge's  readiness  to  say:
``this is my country and the solution and resolution of its problems are  my
responsibility as well''. [Applause.] This is the Shenge who is saying:  ``I
have been vilified in the past, I have been given names  in  the  past,  but
under no circumstances am I  going  to  surrender  my  responsibility  as  a
leader.'' He is a leader who is not  pronouncing  his  leadership  position,
like my learned friend next to me here.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: He is  a  leader  whose  quality  as  a
leader are evinced in the struggle, a leader who at all  material  times  is
prepared to put his shoulder on the wheel.

On the issue of Zimbabwe, Shenge has expressed himself quite openly both  in
Cabinet and outside of it. And Shenge has been to Zimbabwe  himself,  to  be
able to say that this is what we want  to  see  being  done,  to  save  this
country from a revolution - unlike Tony  Leon,  who  has  been  to  Zimbabwe
because it is  a  characteristic  trait  with  him  to  polarise  any  given
situation.   [Interjections.]  He  goes  to  Zimbabwe   to   polarise   that
situation. He talks of Aids to polarise the issue.  He  talks  of  crime  to
polariase the issue. He is very content to be where he  is  right  now,  and
not to be in the theatre of war and struggle against poverty  and  all  ills
that are afflicting our country. [Applause.]

He has chosen to take a position somewhere in the pavilion  and  be  contend
to be a spectator, while the rest of  our  people  here  are  busy  building
their country. He is lost to the cause of this country.  The  solution  that
he is providing for Zimbabwe - ie that we must regard President Mugabe as  a
truant high school boy who must be beaten - is  typical  of  his  historical
behaviour. That is what he did in the past as  a  soldier.  [Interjections.]
That is what exactly he did in the past as a mercenary  in  the  SA  Defence
Force. [Applause.] He was plundering Zimbabwe: he was beating up people  who
opposed the policies  of  the  then  government.  He  is  suffering  from  a
nostalgic yearning.

He is yearning for the  days  when  he  was  a  mercenary.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

The  goals  to  be  resolved  have  been  adequately  highlighted.   Poverty
alleviation is critical, if not central, to the attainment of the goal of  a
better life for all our people. When we give adequate attention to the  idea
of pushing back the frontiers of poverty, we are, at one and the same  time,
addressing and redressing the issues  of  the  health  of  our  people,  the
creation of job  opportunities,  the  reduction  of  crime  levels  and  the
building of an appropriate infrastructure,  both  in  the  urban  and  rural
settings.

Tackling poverty, as was urged in the state-of-the-nation address and  many,
if not all, the problems - social and economic - which are facing us at  the
moment, have been invariably addressed.

I agree with Comrade President that the specific task is not  the  exclusive
responsibility of the Government, as some political parties  would  like  to
suggest. The idea of the creation of a government of national  unity,  which
finds expression in the Harare Declaration which President  himself  drafted
and sold to the OAU, the Non-Aligned Movement, the UN and  the  Commonwealth
long before the Codesa and the World Trade Centre negotiations, was born  of
the desire  to  mobilise  millions  of  our  people,  black  and  white,  to
constitute ilima for the reconstruction  and  development  of  our  country.
That is  the  central  message  that  emerges  in  that  state-of-the-nation
address - for us to see ourselves as participants in the  very  act  of  our
own liberation from these afflictions that we have talked about here.

The easiest stake was, and still is, not the pre-eminence of  this  or  that
particular party, but the redemption of a country and  the  people  who  had
been divided, most of the time, violently for a very, very long time.

Ilima  is  the  answer,  whether  we  are  dealing  with  crime,  education,
rehabilitation,  Zimbabwe,  HIV/Aids,  poverty,  etc.  Ilima  projects   the
collective drive and subdues the individual whim. The DA, UDM and UCDP  will
always remain strangers to the concept, because  their  politics  thrive  in
polarising every issue of national importance. They will,  at  all  material
times, refuse to be part of an ilima - a national  consensus  -  to  tackle,
together, all issues relating to the reconstruction and development  of  our
country. They are happier with the cosy seats somewhere in the  pavilion  as
spectators and fault-finders. That is where the major problem is.  They  are
not going to be involved, and when we talk of the unity of  this  House  and
the unity of our people, we are not talking about unity in  abstract  terms,
but we are talking about unity in action, because  relevant  and  meaningful
unity is born of action out of a desire to achieve certain objective  goals.


We must ignore them and rather continue to mobilise millions of our  people,
black and white, for the realisation of the goals we have set ourselves.  It
is in our own interest, as a people,  to  build  and  consolidate  this  new
patriotism that is emerging. This is our country.  Its  future  and  destiny
are in our own hands. [Interjections.]

Yes, vuk'uZenzele [rise and act]! It was  the  spirit  of  voluntarism  that
delivered us from the clutches of colonial white  domination.  It  is  still
going to be our own participation that will play a role in the  act  of  our
own  liberation  from  crime,  poverty  and  disease.  Over  and  above  the
vuk'uZenzele example that the President has cited in  his  address,  we  are
happy to report  that  the  response  of  our  people,  since  the  call  to
volunteer, has been a massive one in schools, prisons  and  police  stations
across the face of the country.

As a matter of fact, it is the readiness of  our  people  to  work  together
with the police and volunteer information about the  crime  in  their  areas
that  has  contributed  immensely  to  the  huge  successes  that  the   law
enforcement agencies have recorded in the past  year.  It  is,  again,  this
idea of Vuk'uZenzele that has inspired our  people  in  a  number  of  rural
areas to initiate ozenzele: vegetable gardens and cloth  and  wooden  works,
just on their own.

The urban setting also had its VukuZenzele initiatives  such  as  imigalelo,
stokvels, burial societies  etc.,  to  come  to  terms  with  the  objective
reality they sought to influence.

The President is correct when he says  that  this  sense  of  self-reliance,
this refusal to be a spectator and an armchair critic,  must  be  recaptured
because, after all, it has always been there. It must now serve as  a  handy
instrument in our  hands  to  build  the  new  patriotism  across  race  and
ethnicity lines.

The point here is that one does not have to be in Government  to  contribute
to the betterment of the quality of life of our entire people. As  a  matter
of fact, and as the President has indicated,  people  out  there,  on  their
own, are making their mark against poverty and other ills that  afflict  our
country. That is what we mean by unity in action and  that  is  what  is  of
relevance to us as we discuss the State-of-the-nation address. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  President,  Deputy
President and hon members, 96 years ago, the founding  father  of  the  ANC,
Pixley kaSeme, speaking in New York, said, and I quote:


  A brighter day is rising upon Africa. Yes,  the  regeneration  of  Africa
  belongs to this new and powerful period. The regeneration of Africa means
  that a new and unique civilisation is soon to be added to the world.

Sadly, slavery, colonialism, imperialism, neocolonialism and  the  Cold  War
defeated  Africa's  efforts  at  regeneration.   However,   today   we   can
confidently proclaim the 21st century the African century. We do so  because
there is a new generation of African  leaders  who  are  willing  to  accept
their responsibilities and leadership roles, to struggle for and to  achieve
African revival.

The ANC's January 8 statement made on the occasion of its  90th  anniversary
calls on us, I quote:


  To ensure that the process  of  globalisation  does  not  result  in  the
  further all-round widening of the gap between the rich,  developed  north
  and the poor, developing south, which would condemn billions of people to
  poverty.

It goes on to say


  This would be a certain recipe for the most catastrophic social upheavals
  engulfing the whole globe.

This is the same message that the President has been  giving  to  very  many
international audiences when speaking  at  many  international  conferences.
This vision and understanding that the President has been putting out  about
the  challenges  facing  the   new   world   order   is   highly   respected
internationally, and as a result he has become a  true  champion  of  Africa
and the south. It is, therefore, important to ignore the  rantings  of  this
side, which says the President must stop travelling abroad and stay at  home
because there are problems at home.

We cannot divorce our problems from  our  challenges  internationally.  This
was so aptly reflected when the world leaders who convened in New  York  for
the historic United Nations Millenium Summit declared  that  they  would,  I
quote:


  ... support the consolidation of democracy in Africa and assist  Africans
  in their struggle for lasting peace, poverty eradication and  sustainable
  development, thereby bringing Africa into the  mainstream  of  the  world
  economy.

That is the message the President has been giving for many years.

The year 2002 is, therefore, one of the most challenging for South  Africa's
foreign policy. South Africa, by the very nature  of  its  strong  visionary
leadership, its inept democratic alliance,  its  successful  democracy,  the
strength of  its  economic  fundamentals  and  technological  base  and  its
efforts to address the inequalities and injustice  of  the  past,  is  in  a
unique position to contribute positively to the reforming and shaping  of  a
new global order, especially ending global  inequality,  poverty  space  and
the marginalisation of Africa.

Therefore, the greatest challenge facing us is  the  implementation  of  the
New Partnership for Africa's Development. Nepad is  our  hope  to  eradicate
Africa's underdevelopment and poverty. It is a pledge  by  African  leaders,
based on a common vision and on a firm and shared conviction, that  we  have
a pressing duty to eradicate poverty and to place our countries on the  path
of sustainable growth and development.

The initiative is anchored on the determination  of  Africans  to  extricate
themselves and the  continent  from  the  malaise  of  underdevelopment  and
exclusion in a globalising world. It is a call for  a  new  relationship  of
partnership between Africa and the international community to  overcome  the
development chasm. The partnership is to be  founded  on  a  realisation  of
common interests and benefits and on equality.

Nepad recognises that there have been  attempts  in  the  past  to  set  out
continent-wide development  programmes.  For  a  variety  of  reasons,  both
internal and external, including questionable leadership  and  ownership  by
Africans themselves, these have been less than  successful.  However,  as  I
have indicated, today there  is  a  new  set  of  circumstances  which  lend
themselves to integrated practical implementation.

The President, speaking at the OAU summit, said:


  We speak here of a realistic programme of action  and  not  a  mere  wish
  list. As we have taken these decisions, we have also made the  commitment
  that we will ourselves, as Africans, ensure that  we  discharge  our  own
  responsibilities  to  implement  what  we  have  committed  ourselves  to
  implement. In our actions, we will be guided by the principle: Nothing is
  done until it is done.

I am delighted to report that good progress has been made and  the  critical
phase of implementation has now begun. The five  identified  priority  areas
of the Nepad  programme  of  action  are:  capacity-building  on  peace  and
security; economic and  corporate  governance;  banking  and  the  financial
sector; regional infrastructural projects; and agricultural development  and
market access for African products. These  priority  areas  hold  tremendous
opportunities for South African business and civil society, and I urge  them
to get involved in the implementation of the Nepad programme.

It is often stated that the crisis situation in Zimbabwe is  a  litmus  test
for the success of Nepad. We strongly disagree with the threats  that  there
should be collective punishment against all of  Africa  because  of  certain
developments in any one country.  Nepad  cannot  be  held  hostage  to  such
threats.

The meeting this week of high-level representatives of the G8 countries  and
members of the Nepad implementation team will, I believe,  ensure  that  our
detailed and concrete preparations for the G8 summit in Canada in  June  are
on course.

We also look forward to  the  visit  of  the  Canadian  prime  minister,  Mr
Chrétien, who is visiting six African countries, including South Africa,  to
discuss Nepad in preparation for the G8 summit.

To achieve the objectives of Nepad, we  need  strong  institutions.  We  are
therefore proud that in July we will host the first session of  the  African
Union, a continuation of  the  AU.  The  transition  to  the  African  Union
reflects the continuation of Africa's own resolve to deal  with  the  legacy
of colonialism and underdevelopment and to focus on meeting the basic  human
needs of its people.

 Our immediate objective will be to put in place the core structures of  the
African  Union.  These  are  the  assembly  of  the  heads  of  states   and
government,   the   executive   council   of   Ministers,   the    permanent
representative committee of ambassadors, and the  commission  that  will  be
providing the secretariat services of the Union.

We  are  currently  negotiating  the  rules  of  procedure   governing   the
functioning  of  these  structures,  and  we  intend  to  ensure  that   the
structures meet the goals and  ideals  of  the  African  Union.  I  call  on
members of  Parliament  and  the  respective  committees  to  rise  to  this
challenge and to make a contribution to the debate that is  going  on  about
the institutional framework of the African Union.

We will also be hosting the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  in
Johannesburg from 26 August to 4 September.

It  will  be  the  largest  international   conference   ever   held,   with
approximately 65 000 people attending. The main goals of  the  World  Summit
on Sustainable Development are the reinvigoration at the  highest  political
level of the global commitment to sustainable development, the forging of  a
north-south  partnership  to  promote  sustainable   development   and   the
acceleration of the implementation of Agenda  21.  Once  again,  I  call  on
Parliament and its respective committees to make  a  major  contribution  to
the success of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

It is frequently asked why South Africa is a favourite  destination  for  so
many major international conferences. If one listens to the  DP,  one  would
have to believe that we are a country that is dying  because  of  crime  and
other problems. This is a  view  that  is  not  held  by  the  international
community. I think the President,  in  his  state  of  the  nation  address,
addressed the question when he said, and I quote:


  The nations of the world elected to come to  our  country,  because  they
  understand and appreciate what we have done in the last  seven  and  half
  years to address within our own borders precisely the same questions that
  constitute the global agenda.

On September 11, the world was shocked by the terrorist attacks on New  York
and Washington. The South African Government immediately  and  unequivocally
condemned these acts of  terrorism.  We  have  committed  ourselves  to  co-
operate against all forms of terrorism, but this must be under the aegis  of
the UN.
The Secretary General of the UN, speaking  in  the  General  Assembly,  said
that we should remember that  none  of  the  issues  that  faced  us  on  10
September have become less urgent. The number of people living on less  than
$1  a  day  has  not  decreased.  The  numbers  dying  of   Aids,   malaria,
tuberculosis and other preventable  diseases  has  not  decreased.  In  many
parts of the world afflicted by the scourge  of  the  war,  innocent  people
have not ceased being murdered, mutilated, dragged  and  driven  from  their
homes. In short, he said that the agenda for peace,  development  and  human
rights is no less pressing than it was  before  the  terrorist  attacks.  If
anything, it has taken on a new urgency. Seldom has  a  danger  of  division
within the human family and  the  need  to  resist  that  danger  been  more
clearly understood.

We face two possible futures:  a  mutually  destructive  clash  between  so-
called civilisations based on the exaggeration  of  religious  and  cultural
differences, or a  global  community  respecting  diversity  and  rooted  in
universal values. The latter must be our choice. But we can only achieve  it
if we bring real hope to the billions now trapped in poverty,  conflict  and
disease.

The Secretary-General's statement only confirms what South Africa  has  been
saying for many years, ie that in order to defeat terrorism we must adopt  a
holistic  approach.  Therefore,  we  must  deal  with  the  root  causes  of
terrorism, inter alia conflicts and underdevelopment. Unlike some people  on
my left, we do not believe  that  there  can  be  good  terrorists  and  bad
terrorists. All terrorists are bad.

In this  regard  conflict  prevention,  management  and  resolution  on  the
African continent will remain a key foreign policy objectives of  the  South
African  Government.  We  consistently  proclaimed  that  there  can  be  no
progress and development in Africa if  there  is  no  peace,  democracy  and
stability. In this respect, I am happy to note that much progress  has  been
made in finding a long lasting solution to the conflict in the DRC.  We  are
honoured that the inter-congolese dialogue will  start  its  proceedings  in
south Africa on 25  February.  It  is  estimated  that  over  300  Congolese
delegates will gather in South  Africa  to  map  out  the  future  of  their
country. This dialogue is expected to last 45 days. We  will  do  everything
possible to ensure that the inter-congolese dialogue is a huge success.

In Burundi, former President Mandela and  Deputy  President  Zuma's  efforts
led to the ground breaking signing of the Arusha  Peace  and  Reconciliation
Agreement.  Deputy  President  Zuma  and  President  Bongo  of   Gabon   are
continuing their efforts to convince the two armed groups who have  not  yet
signed the ceasefire agreement to do so as soon as possible.  Unfortunately,
there has been very slow progress in this respect.  However,  we  are  happy
that  an  interim  government  has  been  established  and  is  begining  to
function.

All South Africans can be proud of the fact that  the  SA  National  Defence
Force is actively providing  VIP  protection  for  members  of  the  interim
government. The SANDF  has  done  magnificent  work  and  should  be  highly
commended.

The proposed regional summit involving all  stakeholders,  which  will  take
place during the first half of  this  year,  should  consolidate  the  peace
process in Burundi.

With regard to Zimbabwe, while Tony  Leon  keeps  referring  to  this  issue
through selective democratic outpourings, the South  African  Government  is
committed to continue assisting the people of Zimbabwe in  exercising  their
political will in  a  conducive  environment  for  the  upcoming  elections.
[Interjections.]

Towards the realisation of this goal,  the  Government  will  be  sending  a
multisectoral South  African  observer  mission  of  50  persons  under  the
leadership of Dr Motsuanyane. The  50  persons  will  be  drawn  from  trade
unions, big business, black business, the judiciary,  academia,  agriculture
and religious  organisations.  The  observers  will  be  deployed  in  three
phases, the first commencing on 13 February and the last on 3 March 2002.  A
15-person multiparty parliamentary team will depart on 20 February.
One conflict that has given rise to the worst  forms  of  terrorism  is  the
Palestinian-Israeli  conflict.  We  remain  deeply   concerned   about   the
continuing occupation of Palestinian territory, the excessive use of  force,
the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, the wanton  destruction
of property, the house arrest of President Arafat and the deliberate  policy
of destroying the Palestinian  authority's  infrastructure.  It  is  actions
such as these that create a favourable environment for suicide  bombers  and
those that are opposed to peace. [Time expired]. [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, hon  President,  Deputy  President  and  hon
members, the responsibility that lies on our  shoulders  is  to  guide  this
country to the freedom implied in our Constitution.

Today  we  must  ask  whether  those  who  govern  have  succeeded  in  this
historical task. We also  wish  to  rise  to  the  challenge  of  responding
frankly and forthrightly to the central question of  whether  we  are  doing
enough to uplift our people. Instead of acknowledging Government's  failures
to fulfil its historic mandate,  the  President  rather  invoked  the  noble
attitude of lending a hand. South Africans have been called upon to  lend  a
hand in every sphere of society.  As  the  President  acknowledged  himself,
many countless South Africans are doing exactly that.

I will not hesitate to say this: South Africans have been lending a hand  to
other South Africans since the dawn of time. They have done so across  class
and racial barriers, precisely because the government's ability  to  lend  a
hand has been ineffective and insufficient.

It is wrong for this Government and the ANC to hijack this  idea  for  their
own benefit, and to hide their own failures  behind  the  innate  generosity
and compassion  of  South  Africans.  I  submit  that  South  Africans  must
exercise their democratic right to ask what this  Government  is  doing  for
them. This is not a request. It is the rightful expectation of  every  South
African citizen that the Bill of Rights will  be  realised  and  that  their
taxes will be used to improve their quality of life.

South Africans do not expect to be told that they  must  lend  themselves  a
hand whilst the Government wastes their  taxes  on  unnecessary  weapons  of
war. Yes, this Government has  betrayed  the  trust  of  South  Africans  by
opting to waste their taxes  on  billions  of  rands  of  guns,  instead  of
eradicating poverty and unemployment. It is hypocrisy  for  this  Government
to claim, in terms of the reduced budget deficit, that it cannot spend  more
on social needs, and then to turn around and  spend  R66  billion  on  arms.
Indeed this happens against the reality of massive unemployment,  widespread
poverty and starvation, and the escalation of the HIV/Aids pandemic.

The moral standing of a Government that is  insensitive  to  this  scale  of
suffering is highly questionable and must be condemned. Unemployment is  the
engine of  our  poverty,  our  insecurity,  crime  and,  indeed,  our  moral
dilemma. Talk of moral regeneration is an empty vesel without real  hope  of
a real job.

The President  failed  to  demonstrate  leadership  and  vision.  All  South
Africans were anxiously awaiting current programmes of action. All  what  we
ask is for the Government to take the lead and do what they were elected  to
do. Is that asking too much?

Last Friday's speech was an  opportunity  to  provide  clarity  and  vision.
Sadly, on the most important issues, it left many questions  unanswered.  We
hoped for clarity on the economic policy. We waited with  bated  breath  for
the announcement of a new direction, a fresh approach, but in vain.  Nothing
new was said - in fact, more  of  the  same.  Absolutely  no  hope  for  the
unemployed!

Around the world there are signs of a growing recognition that  Washington's
consensus that has  dominated  macroeconomic  thinking  over  the  past  two
decades is fundamentally flawed. A new set of ideas is emerging,  but  South
Africa seems determined to ignore this trend, apparently mesmerised  by  the
course that it set itself some years ago.

That policy has, indeed, delivered microeconomic stability, but we  wish  to
ask the Minister of  Finance:  Where  are  the  fruits  of  that  austerity?
[Interjections.] Where is the growth that is needed to  create  jobs?  These
are some of the unanswered questions.

The UDM was dismayed to note that among all the statistics  offered  by  the
President, there was nothing about the unemployment rate. On this  he  dares
not speak. The reality is too horrible. Everywhere we turn in South  Africa,
the same excruciating reality bears down on us: too few South Africans  have
jobs.

So what would the average South African, who tragically is  more  likely  to
be out of work than employed, have made of the President's speech? Would  he
or she have been encouraged by talk of yet another summit? Last time it  was
called the Jobs Summit; this  time  it  will  be  called  the  ``Growth  and
Development Summit.'' Another year, another summit. South Africans are  sick
and tired of the confusion created by  the  ambivalent  tripartite  alliance
leadership. [Applause.]

This is the ruling clique that preaches the elimination of  unemployment  in
the  streets  and  legislates  retrenchments  and  greater  unemployment  in
Parliament. We need a credible vehicle to drive the process leading  to  the
suggested summit. It certainly must not be the Government  or  its  alliance
partners. We cannot afford to leave the future of our economy in  the  hands
of a clique which  is  responsible  for  the  unemployment  of  hundreds  of
thousands of our people.

Already the summit is doomed to fail if the President insists, as he did  in
his address, that the economic course that he has set is not up for  review.
I wish to ask the President this question: If the economic  policy  is  cast
in stone, what are we going to discuss?

The President repeated the  empty  promises  of  previous  years,  expecting
South Africans to believe that the economic policies  that  have  failed  to
create jobs for eight years will now succeed.  It  is  an  undeniable  truth
that the President fails to acknowledge that  the  people  of  South  Africa
want jobs, not guns. [Applause.]

But where is the action? Where is the evidence that the Government is  doing
all it can to intervene in the  economy,  to  create  jobs?  The  historical
imbalances, which were exacerbated by  the  advent  of  economic  sanctions,
cannot be left to the dictates of the market to be corrected.

Our own Government threw caution to the wind, jettisoned trade  tariffs  and
rushed  into  ill-conceived  free-trade  agreements  with  countries   which
imposed constraints on our  agricultural  produce  and  steel  products.  We
jumped onto this bandwagon of trade liberalisation, when tariffs would  have
given our industries a new lease of life as it emerged  from  the  siege  of
the sanctions of the antiapartheid struggle.
On the other hand they contradict this article of  faith  by  entering  into
agreements with China, whose goods that are brought into this  country  come
from state factories, while local manufacturers have been  forced  to  close
shop because Government would not protect them. [Interjections.]

 The UDM suggests  that  domestic-led  growth  is  the  key  to  the  future
economic success of South Africa. The UDM suggests that  massive  investment
in infrastructural development and maintenance will create jobs and  improve
the quality of life  of  South  Africans.  The  UDM  suggests  that  if  the
Government were to show faith in its own economy by  investing,  that  would
be  the  most  significant  encouragement  to  improving  foreign   investor
confidence.

We feel that the neo-liberal dogma that this Government is  clinging  to  is
not even practised with such fevour  by  its  own  authors,  the  west.  For
instance in France, America  and  across  the  developed  world  governments
continue to subsidise their own industries, including  their  farmers.  They
intervene  in  their  economies   for   the   benefit   of   their   people.
[Interjections.]

It is only here that one is labelled left of the  centre  when  one  expects
government to do more. It is  only  here  where  the  label  ``left  of  the
centre'' is an insult. When the UDM is described as left of the  centre,  we
are proud because it implies that we believe in a form  of  governance  that
puts the people first, and not the ruling clique. [Interjections.]

The UDM has not moved so much to the left as that the ANC has moved  to  the
right in its blind pursuit neo-liberal economic  policies.  [Interjections.]
Unfortunately, they dragged many with them  to  the  right.  Where  are  the
plans to retain our qualified citizens?

Last year the President promised that the immigration Bill would be  steered
towards a speedy enactment. He said it had become the victim  of  a  strange
and irrational tug of war  between  the  ANC  and  the  IFP.  When  is  this
Government going to provide proper incentives, eg salaries and  support,  to
keep our teachers, nurses and doctors in South Africa? [Interjections.]

With respect to  the  academics  of  the  University  of  Stellenbosch,  the
reality on the ground is far harsher than the President  made  their  report
to imply. In places such as Elliotdale, which  Statistics  SA  has  declared
the poorest district in the country, people experience the true  reality  of
this Government's inability to deliver.

The reality of black  economic  empowerment  has  been  disillusionment.  It
became selective and targeted a small ANC elite,  presumably  so  that  they
can in turn fund their party.  Consequently,  empowerment  projects  in  the
mining  and  other  industries  were  concentrated  on  a  few  individuals,
including some of the people who are leading. [Interjections.]

Black economic empowerment is centred around a chosen  elite.  Take,  as  an
example, black economic empowerment in the oil industry.  The  criteria  for
the selection  of  people  as  shareholders  is  not  clear  and  leaves  an
impression that it  is  yet  another  case  of  nepotism  where  people  are
selected on the basis of their relationship with influential people  in  the
corridors of power.

This tendency  is  now  having  a  ripple  effect  among  potential  foreign
investors. Recently  German  businessmen  quizzed  President  Mbeki  on  the
perception that it is a precondition for foreign  investors  to  lean  their
investments to selected black-owned local companies. This was the case  with
the arms-deal controversy, where foreign investors were coerced  into  joint
ventures with certain  black  empowerment  companies  owed  by  certain  ANC
members. [Interjections.]

Mr Pahad knows them! He is jumping like a  popcorn  there  and  I  think  he
should rather sit down! He is nothing else but a glorified Minister  in  the
Office  of  the  President.  He  should  shut  his  mouth,  because  he   is
responsible for these ills! [Interjections.] This is a  clear  case  of  the
ANC-Government's  unethical  business  practices  and   smacks   of   brazen
corruption.
The preservation of human life is fundamental  to  our  democracy.  On  this
score we can frankly and honestly state that this Government has failed  us,
especially in terms of the HIV/Aids pandemics. The Government's failure  and
reluctance  on  this  matter  is  captured  stringently  by  the  City  Pres
editorial of 23 December 2001, and I quote:


  How many thosands of graves must be dug before our  own  Pharaoh  can  be
  made to  realise  that  this  is  too  much?  It  is  apparent  that  the
  Government's refusal to provide these drugs is not  based  on  scientific
  reasons, but purely on the whims  of  a  President  whose  ego  has  been
  bruised and who refuses to accept that his views on HIV/Aids are wrong.


  It is such a tragedy that thousands of young  lives  will  be  sacrificed
  because of a brittled ego  of  a  President  and  a  psychopathic  Health
  Minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.

That is what the City Press said, not  Holomisa.  In  this  hourglass  every
grain of sand represents the life of  a  baby  lost  because  our  President
would not provide HIV/Aids treatment. I want to tell the President  and  his
party that it seems that time is running out.

Those South Africans who have  joined  the  struggle  against  HIV/Aids  and
those who have taken to the street against a Government that purports to  be
people-centred are displaying the highest form of  patriotism  in  order  to
save the lives of helpless babies and millions of infected citizens.

Among these patriots I include the courageous religious  leaderships  -  the
likes of Bishop Ndungana, whom the President  castigated  when  he  differed
with him on these issues and Desmond Tutu, former President Nelson  Mandela,
Constitutional Court Judge  Cameron,  trade  unions,  the  Treatment  Action
Campaign, medical scientists and doctors. [Interjections.]

However, we note that the Government that asks us to lend a hand,  is  tying
the hands of doctors and nurses who  want  to  treat  Hiv/Aids.  Is  it  any
wonder that we are losing their skills to other countries?

Benza ingxolo apha. Ndive uTshwete ebhuda apha. Uyafuna ukuxelelwa.  Asisayi
kuthabatha miyalelo  kuye.  Sanyulwa  apha;  asiqengqelekanga  ngokomxoxozi.
[Uwele-wele] Into ekufuneka  eyazile  yinto  yokuba  bachithe  iimali  apha,
bethenga izixhobo, abantu betyiwa yindlala, begula. [Uwele-wele.]

Nangoku ndicela umngeni kuye ndisithi aze akhe aye eMpuma Koloni,  akhe  aye
kujonga iindlela eziya bangazilungisiyo. Sizibona zilungiswa  kuphela  phaya
ecaleni kwekhaya lika  Mphathiswa  weMisebenzi  yoLuntu,  kodwa  kwintsalela
yeMpuma Koloni akukho nto.

Makahambe aye KwiPhondo loMtla; abantu  bayalamba.  Makahambe  aye  KwaZulu-
Natal; abantu bayalamba. Badlala ngemali. Bahamba apha esithubeni,  bexokisa
abantu. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[They make a noise here. I heard Tshwete waffle here. He needs to  be  told.
We shall not take  instruction  from  him.  We  are  here  because  we  were
elected; we did not roll into this place like melons. [Interjections.]  What
he should know is that they spent money  here  on  buying  arms,  while  the
people out there are starving and sick. [Interjections.]

I challenge him to go to the Eastern Cape to see  the  state  of  the  roads
they are failing to repair. We see repairs going on on the  roads  close  to
the home of the Minister of Public Works, but in the rest  of  the  province
nothing is being done.

He must go to the Northern Province; people are starving. He  should  go  to
KwaZulu-Natal; people are starving there too. They are  wasting  the  money.
They move around the country, telling people lies. [Applause.]]

Mr T M GONIWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: the hon member  Mr  Bantu
Holomisa says that hon Minister Tshwete goes around  the  country  lying  to
people. That is unparliamentary.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I thought the hon Holomisa  was  not  saying  the
individual hon Tshwete, but a collective that  hon  Tshwete  belongs  to.  I
think we would need to scrutinise the words that he used,  so  that  we  can
see what he actually said.

The MINISTER FOR THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Madam  Speaker,
Comrade President, Comrade Deputy  President  and  members  of  this  House,
having listened to various leaders of opposition parties, one  feels  shamed
by the quality of presentation before this House.

When I listened to some of these inputs, I could not  help  but  consider  a
quotation ...

When I listened to some of these inputs, I could not  help  but  consider  a
quote from John Ruskin. He says that there are  two  types  of  people:  The
believer, the builder and the praiser; or the unbeliever, the destroyer  and
the critic.
We listened to various people this afternoon, including  the  hon  Holomisa,
who not so long ago was a General in some small part of the country that  he
ran down and milked at that point in time.  [Interjections.]  Think  of  the
Judge White commission. When one listens to the kind of input he makes,  one
feels that clearly, he must go and look at economics  once  again.  He  must
also seriously review that nature of misinformation to this House.

The hon member has a responsibility  to  inform  the  public  correctly.  He
should not try to build himself - not his party, himself - on the  backs  of
the people of this country. [Interjections.] It does not become anybody  who
sees himself as a patriot. [Interjections.] When I listened to him,  and  to
the hon Tony Leon, it  made  me  think  of  a  poet,  Adam  Small,  who  is,
ironically in the DA now. He said:

Die Here het gaskommel.

[Tussenwerpsels.] Wat hy gesê het, is:
  ... wat maak dit saak
  soos die Engelsman sê it cuts no ice
  die Here het gaskommel
  en die dice het verkeerd geval ...

In this instance, for the likes of the two of them ...


  ... daai's maar al.

They do not care, ... [Interjections.] ...  because  in  essence  what  they
cannot  accept  is  that  there   are   two   primary   choices   in   life.
[Interjections.]  The  ANC  and  the  President  are  walking   that   path.
[Interjections.] In the words of Dennis Waitley those choices are -


  ...  to  accept  the  conditions  as  they  exist,  or  to   accept   the
  responsibility for changing them.

We have accepted the reponsibility for changing  them.  [Interjections.]  We
are willing to ensure that we  take  things  forward,  because  one  of  the
central themes running through the President's  address  on  Friday  is  the
role that  civil  society  can  play,  that  broader  society  can  play  in
realising  the  ideals  we  have  for  this  beautiful  country   of   ours.
VukuZenzele! We are not prepared  to  demobilise  our  people,  as  the  hon
Holomisa suggests. Shame on him ... [Applause.] ... for  implying  that  our
people should be passive recipients  of  state  power,  of  state  services,
without their involvement.

Our President challenged the nation, and Mr  Holomisa  is  not  prepared  to
accept that, because he has always been shortsighted. I want to  go  further
and say that the President brought this theme to the fore,  both  last  year
and this year. This is the evidence of his wisdom,  of  his  leadership  and
visionary qualities which he will not accept.

The President is encouraging our nation to draw on qualities, at this  point
in time underutilised, and to this effort, to harness more capacity  in  the
war against poverty. We have the courage to take it forward. It is  not  new
to the ANC that individuals and organisations that are mobilised  to  assist
in  fulfilling  the  country's  national   agenda   can   make   a   massive
contribution. Across the nations of the world, in varied cultures,  we  find
a multitude of expressions of public life,  people  who  look  out  for  one
another's wellbeing, and that of society as a whole.

Our country has a proud tradition of using people's power for improving  the
fate of society in general. There has been a tradition of  rendering  public
service where the state cannot, will not, or did not in  the  past.  Members
should turn their minds 10 years back, preceding the dawn  of  democracy  in
South Africa. In every township, from Mdantsane to Guguletu, from Huhudi  to
Alexandra,  the  civics  and  other  democratic  structures  were   directly
involved in rendering  services  where  the  recalcitrant  apartheid  regime
denied people access to resources of the state, or to  supplement  where  it
was clearly of an inadequate quality.

All over South Africa  street  and  block  committees  were  discussing  and
contributing ideas. It was a buzz! The energy was felt.
This phenomenon was  given  names  by  the  intellectuals.  They  called  it
``human  and  social  capital''.  The  prevailing  wisdom  is   that   these
additional forms of capital are as important in the bigger scheme of  growth
and development as what is traditionally accepted as  capital  -  money  and
infrastructure. It says that we should not stare ourselves  blind  at  money
and infrastructure alone. If we filter these other  forms  of  capital  into
the equation, it has the potential of changing  our  development  experience
tremendously.

Now in our second term as a democratic Government,  South  Africa  is  in  a
beneficial position where civil society and the market can operate within  a
clear national agenda set by a democratic Government within  the  parameters
of a Constitution that  makes  significant  room  for  direct  and  indirect
participation of the population. The policy  framework  has  been  developed
adequately to allow for more durability in the policy  environment,  and  it
is starting to become marked by consolidation and continuation, rather  than
by major changes and radical suspensions  of  policy  initiatives.  We  have
passed the situation where a deliberate vacuum was  left  by  the  apartheid
government in service delivery to large segments of our population.

South Africa has resisted the idea that the state should be  diminished  and
left weakened in terms of its service delivery role. As a Government we  are
convinced that a strong state, in combination with strong  partners  in  the
market and the community sector, is a  recipe  for  our  future  development
successes. And we will not be demobilised by  rhetoric  and  speeches.  That
rhetoric and speeches are safe in some statements by irresponsible  leaders,
as we have seen today:

Diegene wat  geensins  patriote  is  nie  en  diegene  wat  patriotisme  nie
verstaan nie. [Those who are no  patriots  at  all  and  those  who  do  not
understand patriotism.]

A situation of finding synergy and harmony between  efforts  emanating  from
different quarters will allow for greater effectiveness and less wastage  of
our resources in fruitless competition.
We should also resist  the  inclination  to  think  that  partners  need  to
compete with one another  to  fulfil  the  exact  same  function  or  in  an
undermining fashion exploit  one  another's  weaknesses  or  positions.  The
successful relationship is rather one of complementing one  another  in  the
knowledge of our relative strengths.

I just want  to  go  back  to  the  relevant  strengths  and  weaknesses  of
different  partners  in  the  development  process.  Our  President,  in  an
interview  with  SABC-TV,  commented  that  activism   and   competence   in
mobilisation techniques are not really the  strengths  that  our  Government
officials will be remembered for. Many of them are not particularly  apt  at
dealing with communities at grass-roots  level.  However,  they  do  control
vast resources  and  they  are  able  to  handle  large-scale  projects  and
programmes out to scale. Their ability to access and mobilise financial  and
other infrastructures do exceed that of small community  organisations.  The
state is the only institution that has the  reach  and  scope  to  roll  out
programmes to scale. This in turn is not  a  characteristic  of  efforts  of
small informal community organisations that are more particularist in  their
nature and limited scope. Hence the need  for  a  close  partnership  as  we
strive to deepen the Batho Pele principles.

As I have pointed out, we have a proud history  of  activism,  in  spite  of
what was shamefully said earlier in this House. We have a proud history  and
tradition of participation. International experts in  participatory  methods
of development, policy-making and decision-making in the past came to  South
Africa, acknowledging that it is one of a  handful  of  countries  that  are
setting the standard and the agenda regarding participatory methods.

They came here to look at how it was done before they wrote their  textbooks
and manuscripts. On one occasion our President reffered to  a  comment  made
by the head of state in Austria, describing South Africa as a pilot  project
that is being closely observed and analysed by the international  community.


The time has come for us to re-assert our energised presence in  the  spaces
which were created for us and which we created in our legislative  framework
to determine the quality of our lives and proffer quality solutions  to  the
problems we are experiencing, and which is deeply rooted  in  the  expertise
that is created through the university of life, through  a  government  that
is interested in its people. Power to the people! Vuk'uZenzele.
[Wake up and do it for yourself]!

I  think  the  entire  policy-making  culture  of  this  country  has   been
transformed, as we can see, and more detailed programmes and project  levels
opportunities are been created, where direct opportunities for  consultation
and even more  meaningful  levels  of  participation  exist.  These  include
parents in school management bodies, also looking at  communities  that  are
shaping  safety  and  security  transformation  through  community  policies
forums, and user consultation forums for public health  facilities,  but  to
mention a few.

I would like to conclude by  saying  to  this  House,  quoting  from  Martin
Luther King:


  There is nothing more dangerous than to build  a  society  with  a  large
  segment of the people in that society who feel they have no stake in  it;
  who feel that they have nothing to lose. People who have a stake in their
  society  protect  that  society,  but  when  they  don't  have  it,  they
  unconsciously want to destroy it.

I quote this  piece  because  of  hon  Holomisa's  irresponsible  statements
before this House.

We are never going to allow the demobilisation of our  people  -  we  fought
for that too dearly. We cannot allow those  who  are  from  the  peanut/pina
gallery within the House to throw stones and to make  suggestions  that  are
ill - based and ill-founded, in an attempt to misinform our people, such  as
that leader who is howling showing he is a nitwit in this  House.[Applause.]
[Interjections.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, the state  of  the  nation  adress  by  the
President was well received by most South  Africans.  Many  believe  it  was
balanced, albeit lacking in detail on issues  that  needed  urgent  response
and answers.

We salute Government for providing about 7 million of our people  access  to
clean  running  water  and  for  successfully  making  about   3,5   million
electricity grid connections. Commendable progress has  also  been  made  in
the redestribution of over 1 million hectares in the land reform  programme.
The ACDP says well done for these achievements.

In his speech, the President also informed this House  that  the  number  of
houses built or which are still under construction  to  date  is  about  1,2
million. Because we  know  about  the  difficulties  many  have  with  their
houses, we want to caution Government not to sacrifice quality for  quantity
in the process of providing desperately needed houses.

Another big plus for which I must commend the President is  his  annoucement
that the allocations of both  old-age  pension  and  child  grants  will  be
increased by far more  than  the  rate  of  inflation.  This  is  good  news
especially for those South African who rely on these grants  as  their  only
source of income.

Taxpayers always welcome the news of futher tax cuts, particularly those  on
the lower end of the salary scale. It was refreshing also to hear  that  the
plight of the poor is at the top of Government's agenda.

Not only South Africans, but also most people all over  the  the  world  who
are concerned about events in Zimbabwe, agrees with the  President  when  he
says, and I qoute: [... let the people of Zimbabwe speak through the  ballot
box!]

This will only be possible if the Mugabe government creates  a  climate  and
condition  conducive  for  free  and  far  elections  to  take  place.  This
obviously requires  the  maintanence  of  law  and  order.  The  President's
remarks about Zimbabwe lacked detail and the assurance that  our  Government
cares about what is happening to our neighbours in the North.

A perception must not  be  created  that  our  President  or  Government  is
protecting and defending President Robert Mugabe who clearly has  a  problem
that has turned him into a ruthless dictator.  He  is  a  man  who  despises
democratic principles and practices.

It is regrettable that by yesterday the Zimbabwean  government  had  refused
to give accreditation to the head of the EU observer mission, Pierre  Schori
of  Sweden.  The  fact  that  the  Zimbabwean  government  rejects  election
observers  from  Sweden,  Britain,  Denmark,  Finland,   Germany   and   the
Netherlands, should justify the EU's decision to impose smart  sanctions  on
Mr Mugabe, his family and Cabinet Ministers. Their assets, most of which,  I
believe one day we will hear were stolen, must be  frozen.  They  should  be
denied visas to European countries, especially those countries whose  people
they are denying accreditation. It is high  time  that  EU  countries  start
playing the hard ball Mr Mugabe has been playing for a long time.
Why should all the people who disagree with him publicly be accused of  bias
in favour of the opposition parties? Why should the  print  shop  that  does
business with opposition parties be petrol-bombed? Why  should  the  offices
of Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper, the  Daily  News,  be  fire-
bombed for disagreeing with and reporting on the criminal activities of  the
so-called war veterans? I trust that the South African observer  mission  to
Zimbabwe will not be intimidated  into  silence  when  they  see  atrocities
taking place in front of them.

In July this year our country will be hosting the  founding  summit  meeting
of  the  African  Union.  For  the  African  Union  to  succeed  where   the
Organisation of African Unity failed, a few things  will  have  to  be  done
differently.

Firstly, the AU must honestly promote and  defend  multiparty  democracy  in
Africa, while denouncing  dictators,  military  and  oppresive  governments.
Secondly, All African leaders who are part of the AU must hold  one  another
accountable and insist on good governance, the rule  of  law,  human  rights
and fiscal discipline. Those who enrich themselves from state  coffers  must
not be allowed to get away with it.

When he was in Paris,  the  Nigerian  president,  Obasanjo,  said  that  his
predecessor, General Sani Abacha, and his family stole  about  $4,3  billion
from public funds during his four and a half years in  power.  Although  the
theft and plundering of national assets were widely-known, even the OAU  did
nothing about them. Our President has to  assure  us  that  such  corruption
will not be tolerated in the African  Unity,  even  if  he  has  to  make  a
principled stand against corruption on his own.

Thirdly,  African  leaders  must  take  full  responsibility  for  what   is
happening on this continent and stop shifting the blame all  the  time.  For
how long will our leaders blame colonialism  whenever  they  fail  to  solve
their problems? We want to see  maturity  taking  place  among  our  African
leaders. Two of the signs of that maturity will be a willingness  to  accept
constructive criticism and full responsibility for what is happening on  the
African continent, and particularly in their  respective  countries.  Before
we  can  seriously  talk   about   African   solutions,   we   must   accept
responsibility for both our successes and failures.

What the hon President said on the issue of Aids was disappointing and  much
less than what had been expected. Most South  Africans  had  hoped  that  he
would support the principle of providing anti-retroviral drugs to  all  HIV-
positive  pregnant  mothers,  in  order  to   reduce   the   mother-to-child
transmission of the virus.

The ACDP understands that there are a lot of other logistical  factors  that
are involved in the efficacy of anti-retroviral interventions, and  that  is
the reason I am referring to his principled position. We salute the  Western
Cape and Kwazulu-Natal governments for taking a principled stand  of  making
Nevirapine accessible to all pregnant mothers who are HIV-positive.

On the issue of crime, South Africans who do not have personal body  guards,
and whose properties do not have 24-hours security guards,  will  definitely
disagree with the hon President, the hon Minister and  the  Government,  who
say that the police are winning the war against crime. Global agencies  that
have ranked South Africa as one of the  most  unsafe  places  on  earth  are
correct. For as long as innocent people are robbed  and  killed,  and  women
and children are raped on a daily basis, then the Government is denying  the
reality of what is happening on the ground by trying to convince the  public
that violent crime is on the decrease. It is not seen on the ground.

Lastly, the ACDP fully endorses the call by hon Dr Buthelezi for unity,  and
as he put it, even if we speak with different voices and emphasis.  When  we
disagree with the Government, we are not unpatriotic. We are  concerned  and
we love our country. [Applause.]

Somlomo, Mongameli namalungu ePalamente ahloniphekileyo. [Madam Speaker,  Mr
President and hon members ...]

Our  President  has  posed  the  challenge  of  ensuring  that  our   social
transformation is built on the foundation of  a  caring  and  people-centred
society. My input will  focus  on  how  health  policy  is  contributing  to
achieving the above national goal. I will touch on the achievements  of  our
policy and on the challenges still lying ahead: the  HIV/Aids  epidemic  and
the quality of care in our health care institutions.

When the ANC Government took over,  we  were  confronted  with  poverty  and
underdevelopment. In health care institutions we spend  a  lot  of  time  on
ensuring that we improve  access  to  health  facilities  for  all,  through
clinic-building programmes,  through  restructuring  hospitals  and  through
ensuring fair distribution of health personnel. We  introduced  free  health
care at a primary level.  Now,  the  focus  is  on  the  reconstruction  and
rehabilitation  of  our  infrastructure.  The  ANC  Government  has  put  an
emphasis  on  rehabilitating  the  teaching  hospitals,   particularly   the
formerly disadvantaged institutions.

 Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central  Hospital  in  Durban  is  now  complete  and
should be functional soon. A new Umtata academic hospital will be  completed
in March this year. This replaces the hospital that  was  neglected  by  the
Holomisa homeland  government  and  allowed  to  degenerate  into  a  shack.
[Interjections.] Despite all these efforts, we still face the  challenge  of
producing health personnel capable and willing to be deployed  in  the  most
deserving and rural areas.

We introduced community service for doctors, pharmacists  and  dentists.  We
salute the government and the people of Cuba for not only lending  us  their
doctors, but for also offering to  train  our  students  from  disadvantaged
communities. They pose a challenge to our own medical schools which fail  to
attract and support such students. We need to urgently review the  admission
processes and criteria in all our medical schools.

The ANC has fought for affordable medicines ensuring that we put the  health
of the nation first before profits. We have won  the  first  battle  in  the
courts. We are winning the support of  other  nations.  We  are  now  better
placed to promulgate the law and start implementing the policy.

We are under no illusion that we can eradicate the  burden  of  diseases  of
poverty, like TB, HIV/Aids, cholera and malaria, as the President  said,  at
the push of a button''. We are also aware that the health  outcomes  do  not
only depend on health services. The health of our nation relies  heavily  on
the provision of infrastructure like clean water,  sanitation,  electricity,
telephones, housing; on adequate food  security  through  the  provision  of
land and  agricultural  skills;  and,  lastly,  on  education,  particularly
female  basic  education.  The  ANC  Government   has   introduced   various
interventional programmes to address these challenges  hence  ensuring  that
we are on course for a better life for all.

I shall now turn to the greatest challenge that our country is  facing:  the
HIV/Aids epidemic. The ANC is moving from the  premise  that  the  HI  virus
causes Aids.  Currently,  there  is  no  cure  for  Aids.  This  should  not
immobilise us into a corner of despair, because as a nation we can  win  the
war against this epidemic. We shall gain courage from  the  fact  that  more
than 70% of our adult population is still free of the disease.

The ANC concurs with the words of Kofi Annan who,  when  opening  the  World
Assembly last year said:


  Aids is an unprecedental global  crisis.  It  requires  an  unprecedented
  response from each and every  one  of  us.  Turning  back,  the  HIV/Aids
  epidemic is a task beyond individual efforts no matter how outstanding or
  heroic. It requires communities, nations, regions  to  come  together  in
  concerted co-ordinated action.

From the outset, long before some of the opposition parties and some fly-by-
night leaders  were  even  awake  or  even  conceived,  the  ANC  adopted  a
multisectoral approach,  nondiscrimination  of  affected  people,  community
empowerment  to  get  a  community-based  response,  public  awareness   and
community-based prevention initiative.

Contrary to what the Leader of the  Opposition,  Tony  Leon,  is  saying  or
preaching, there is no change in ANC policy.

The ANC opted for a comprehensive  approach  based  on  social  mobilisation
rather than simply stop gap measures. Dr  Peter  Piot  of  UNAIDS  concurred
with our position during last year's World Assembly, when he said:


  The world has known about Aids for 20 years. During that time the disease
  has spread to every continent. In the worst affected countries it has set
  back human progress by decades. But over the past 20 years we have learnt
  a great deal about how to tackle Aids. The most important lesson has been
  that half measures do not work against the epidemic.  The  only  way  the
  epidemic can be reversed is through total social mobilisation.

Our  Government  has  responded  by  forming  partnerships   in   mobilising
resources and society, through the South African National  Aids  Council  or
Sanac. The national strategy incorporates the following: Prevention  through
awareness, life skill and mother-to-child programmes;  treatment,  care  and
support; human and legal rights; monitoring research and  surveillance;  and
a special focus on the youth.

 For the strategy to succeed, it  must  take  into  account  what  has  been
described as the main drivers of the epidemic  in  Africa,  namely  poverty,
migration and gender imbalances.

Some of the successes are the following: We  are  currently  spending  about
R190 million in the Government action plan focusing on  prevention.  We  are
the only country in Southern Africa that procures  and  distributes  quality
condoms free to the  public.  The  Government  is  currently  spending  R100
million per annum, due to the three-times increase in  condom  use  from  96
000 in 1999 to 250 000 last year.

More than 90% of South Africans are aware of how  to  prevent  the  disease.
Antenatal surveys indicate  that  the  increasing  prevalence  we  witnessed
previously has stabilised in the last two years by about 24%.

This year we will be doubling our  allocation  for  integrated  strategy  to
R320  million.  This  will  focus  on  life  skills  programmes,   voluntary
counselling and testing and community-based initiatives.

There has been significant changes in behaviour among  younger  age  groups.
The surveys among women under 20 years of age show that while  30%  of  them
reported condom use in 1999, 66%  used  condoms  during  their  last  sexual
encounter in 2001.

The prevalence in the under  20  years  age  group,  which  is  the  closest
indication of new infections, is on the decline.

There are still many challenges ahead. We need  to  sustain  our  prevention
awareness campaigns with more emphasis on behavioural  change.  The  ANC  is
firm and committed to finding ways to  prevent  and  reduce  mother-to-child
transmission. We encourage the Government in  partnership  with  society  to
confront whatever challenges we have identified in the 250 nevirapine  pilot
sites, so that we may expand the programme to other areas.

We would like  to  dispel  the  myth  that  antiretroviral  drugs  cure  the
disease.

Kukhona abazama  ukuhlukanisa  uhulumeni  nemiphakathi.  Bafaka  imfundisoze
yokuthi kunekhambi elingelapha lesi sifo. UHulumeni we-ANC uzimisele  ukulwa
nokubhebhetheka kwaleli gciwane. [There are people who are trying to  create
division within the Government. They  are  spreading  the  false  idea  that
there is a cure for this disease. The ANC Government  is  prepared  to  stop
the spread of this disease.]

We must also dispel the myth that the ANC does not care for the infected  or
the affected people.  What  we  have  not  done  is  politicising  the  Aids
epidemic for narrow political gains. We,  as  a  caring  organisation,  have
chosen to work with the people and society in finding solutions for all  the
challenges we confront in fighting the scourge.

In this war, we shall not divide but unite  our  communities  in  action  to
defeat the epidemic.

While we may agree with some of  the  important  matters  raised  by  iNkosi
Buthelezi, we must take cognisance of medical research  and  bad  practices.
Even in the developed world  the  advice  is  against  the  blanket  use  of
antiretrovirals,  for  the  simple  reason  of  costs,  toxicity   and   the
increasing propensity to develop resistance.

The  ANC  shall  continue  to  fight  for  affordable  medicine   to   treat
opportunistic infections - which are the major causes  of  deaths  -  to  be
available in all our community. We shall continue to fight and mobilise  for
affordable and safe antiretrovirals.

We shall continue to  roll  out  necessary  infrastructure  to  empower  our
communities to have food securities and healthy life  styles,  in  order  to
boost their immunity against communicable diseases.

We shall continue to dispel the discrimination of  the  affected  people  in
our communities. We will fight for the dignity  and  strive  to  treat  them
with compassion. We shall mobilise all sectors of our society for  community
initiatives, partnerships and community-based care and support.

We remain convinced that the battle against Aids will be lost or won at  the
community level. Every organisation or individual must  define  his  or  her
contribution to the national effort to fight the  scourge.  This  Parliament
must define its role. We believe that  MPs  are  in  a  better  position  to
destigmatise Aids and mobilise community support and awareness.

In conclusion, I would like to address the equality of care from our  health
institutions. The Government has laid the basis  for  people-centred  health
care. We have adopted the Batho  Pele  and  the  patient's  charter  in  all
provinces.  We  are  transforming  governance  structures  in   our   health
institutions.

What is critical is to translate these into  palpable  action  in  order  to
avoid forcing our poor people to go and buy their  dignity  elsewhere.  This
can only be done if our health professionals go an extra mile in their  call
of duty to ensure that they contribute in easing the burden on  our  people.
This is possible if our communities  form  partnerships  in  governance  and
service delivery, particularly to the vulnerable communities.

The ANC thanks all those patriots who have  chosen  to  put  a  shoulder  in
persuing our national goal for a better life for all.

[Applause.]]

Dr J T DELPORT: Agb Speaker, Meneer die President, ek wil  net  ter  aanvang
die baie DA ondersteuners op die gallery welkom heet hier in die  Parlement.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]

Op 27 Februarie 1901 het generaal Piet Cronje  by  Paardeberg  oorgegee  met
4000 man, 'n beslissende gebeurtenis in die Tweede Vryheidsoorlog.  Generaal
De Wet sê hiervan dat dié daad tot die  einde  van  die  oorlog  sy  letsels
gelaat het. Dit kan 'n mens verstaan. Leiers besef nie hoe groot  die  effek
van hulle dade op die siel en gees van hulle mense is nie. Dit was  nie  per
se die verlies van 4000 man nie, nee, meer die  verlammende  uitwerking  van
willoosheid.

Voor ek ernstiger perspektiewe aanroer, net drie kort opmerkings  gerig  aan
die adres van die agb lid, mnr Marthinus van  Schalkwyk.  Eerstens,  dit  is
duidelik die agb lid het nog nie 'n pos  nie.  Hy  moes  praat  vir  'n  pos
vandag. [Gelag.] [Applous.] Meer ernstig, hy het sy  Paardeberg  belewe.  Hy
het 'n keuse gemaak. Hy moet  daarmee  saamleef  dat  hy  sy  wil  en  visie
onherroeplik  gekompromitteer  het.  'n  Derde  opmerking,  in  ligte  luim,
gelukkig het hy  nie  meer  4000  man  om  mee  oor  te  gee  nie!  [Gelag.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr J T DELPORT: Hon Speaker, Mr President, at the outset I would just  like
to  welcome  the  many  DA  supporters  in  the   gallery   to   Parliament.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

On 27 February 1901 General Piet Cronje surrendered at Paardeberg with  4000
men, a crucial event in the Boer War. General De Wet  said  in  this  regard
that this act left its scars until the end of the war.  One  can  understand
that. Leaders do not realise how great the effect of their deeds is  on  the
soul and spirit of their people. It was not the loss of  4000  men  per  se;
no, more the paralysing effect of passivity.

Before I touch on  more  serious  perspectives,  I  just  have  three  brief
remarks aimed at the address of the hon member, Mr Marthinus van  Schalkwyk.
Firstly, it is clear the hon member does not yet have a position.  Today  he
had to talk for a position. [Laughter.] [Applause.] More seriously,  he  has
experienced his Paardeberg. He made a choice. He has to live with  the  fact
that he compromised his wishes and vision irrevocably. A third remark, in  a
lighter vein  -  fortunately  he  no  longer  has  4000  men  to  surrender!
[Laughter.]

Let me now turn to the President's address. There is  general  consensus  in
this House today that South Africa is faced with three major  enemies,  that
is  poverty,  crime  and  Aids.  I  had  hoped  today  that  we  would  have
experienced on Friday a President that stood up forcefully for  his  people,
for  what  they  need.  I  had  hoped  that  he  would  have  announced  the
cancellation of the arms contract as far as it is legally possible; that  at
the very least he would have initiated an inquiry into  the  possibility  of
such a cancellation, because that is what we must do. The arms  deal  was  a
senseless exercise. It was not what was  needed,  given  the  needs  of  our
country.

We can no longer afford to spend money, billions of rands  on  a  fictitious
enemy. We now need to use that money to fight the three  major  enemies,  ie
crime, poverty and Aids. These are the enemies. The hon the President,  with
all due respect, did not deal adequately and decisively with these  enemies.
Government's priorities are  wrong.  The  priorities  of  our  spending  are
wrong.

Die siel en gees van ons mense kry seer as gevolg  van  hierdie  willoosheid
aan die kant van die Regering. Sien agb lede, wat  nou  hier  lekker  praat,
nog die wanhoop in mense se oë as nog 'n gesin  onder  roof  en  moord  lei?
[Tussenwerpsels.] Sien hulle hoe die vlam van hoop vir 'n  beter  lewe  kwyn
as  daar  nog  'n  dag  verbygaan  waarop  arm   mense   nog   armer   word?
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]

Sien agb lede dit nog raak dat die trots uit 'n man se  lewe  verdwyn?  Sien
hulle nog raak hoe sy skouers hang as daar nog 'n dag  verbygegaan  het,  en
hy nie werk kon kry nie? [Applous.] Sien die agb  President  die  paniek  in
die siekes se oë wat weet teen hierdie siekte het hulle nie raad nie?

Ons polisie  het  die  afgelope  jaar  minder  geword,  nie  meer  nie.  Die
infeksiekoers  van  HIV/Vigs  het  gestyg,  dit  het  nie  gedaal  nie.  Die
munisipaliteite wat in ons voorlinie moet veg teen armoede raak stadig  maar
seker bankrot. Dit gaan  op  'n  fiasko  uitloop.  Werkgeleenthede  wat  die
enigste ware antwoord is op armoede word minder, dit word nie meer nie.

Dít is die werklikheid waarteenoor hierdie Regering  'n  willoosheid  en  'n
onvermoë om op te tree toon. Ek vra met groot  erns,  het  die  Regering  sy
deernis met die lot van ons mense  verloor?  Het  wêreldburgerskap  vir  ons
belangriker geword as 'n siek kind? Het luukse motors en  stralers  vir  die
Regering belangriker geword as brood op die tafels van ons armes?
In belang van hulle wat nie die geleentheid het om hier te  praat  nie,  bid
ek dat die agb President die regte  keuses  sal  maak.  Ek  wil  hê  dat  sy
Paardeberg, waar hy by staan, 'n gloriedag vir hom sal word,  want  dit  sal
glorie vir Suid-Afrika bring. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The soul and spirit  of  our  people  are  injured  as  a  result  of  this
passivity on the part of the Government. Do hon members, who speak  here  so
easily, still not see the hopelessness in people's eyes when another  family
suffers robbery and murder? [Interjections.] Do they see the flame  of  hope
for a better life fading when  another  day  passes  in  which  poor  people
become even poorer? [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Do hon members still see the pride disappearing from a man's life?  Do  they
still see how his shoulders hang when yet another day passes and he has  not
been able to find work? [Applause.] Does  the  hon  the  President  see  the
panic in the eyes of those who are sick and know that they have  no  defence
against this illness?

Our police have been reduced over the past few  years,  not  increased.  The
infection  rate  of  HIV/Aids  has  risen,   it   has   not   dropped.   The
municipalities which must fight on  our  front  lines  against  poverty  are
slowly but surely becoming bankrupt. This is going to result  in  a  fiasco.
Job opportunities, which are the only real answer to poverty,  are  becoming
fewer, not more.

This is the reality towards which this Government is indicating a  passivity
and an inability to act. I ask in all seriousness, has the  Government  lost
its compassion with the fate of our people? Has  global  citizenship  become
more important to us than a sick child? Have luxury  cars  and  jets  become
more important to the Government than bread on the tables of our poor?

In the interests of those who do not have the opportunity to speak  here,  I
pray that the hon the President will make the  right  choices.  I  want  his
Paardeberg, at which he is standing, to become a glory day for him,  because
it will bring glory for South Africa. [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

Mrs W S NEWHOUDT-DRUCHEN: Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,  hon  members  of
Parliament, South Africa belongs to all who live in  it,  black  and  white.
The ANC's 8 January statement said, and I quote:


  We know that we are beginning to off-load the burden of poverty,  hunger,
  disease, ignorance and underdevelopment that continue to afflict millions
  of our people.

 Some of our biggest burdens are child rape and abuse.  The  opposition  may
choose to believe differently, but we know that  the  apartheid  structures,
institutional marginalisation  and  inequalities  bred  violence  and  moral
decay in our communities.

Since it was formed 90 years ago, the ANC's struggle for liberation for  has
been motivated by strong  ethical  convictions,  especially  for  the  moral
value of justice and equality for  all,  and  respect  and  care  for  other
people.

We are a young democratic South Africa, but we  are  still  confronted  with
the diseased social and economic climate of this apartheid legacy which  has
resulted in the abuse of many of our children.

In South Africa, children's rights as outlined  in  the  Convention  on  the
Rights of the Child, are enshrined in section 28 of the Bill  of  Rights  of
the Constitution. The Bill of Rights is informed by the  understanding  that
a child's best  interests  are  of  paramount  importance  in  every  matter
concerning the child. Our children are precious and they have the  right  to
the best our country can offer. Our children's rights should  be  understood
by every child in this country and be respected by every adult.

Allow me to  highlight  some  of  the  rights  that  we  need  to  know  and
emphasise, wherever we go: the right  to  family  or  parental  care  or  to
appropriate alternative care when removed from the family  environment;  the
right to basic nutrition, shelter, health  care  and  social  services;  the
right to be protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse and degradation  and
the right to be protected from exploitative labour practices.

From the Freedom Charter,  we  know  that  ``all  shall  enjoy  equal  human
rights, all shall be equal before the law''.  All  of  these  oblige  us  to
fight for the creation of a nonracial and nonsexist society, both  of  which
are requirements contained in our democratic  Constitution.  It  also  means
that we must work to ensure that the rights of children  are  respected  and
enforced.

The struggle for real equality stands at the heart of our efforts to  create
a new people-centred society. They encompass all  aspects  of  our  national
life and touch every one of our citizens. They require that we  all  achieve
the goal of equality, in state and society, through a sustained  integration
and open process of fundamental social transformation. We  should  eradicate
the legacy  of  a  racist  and  patriarchal  society  which  resulted  in  a
situation of contempt, domination and discrimination  for  the  overwhelming
majority of our people, including our children. They require of us to  expel
from our society immoral behaviour which results in  the  victimisation  and
abuse of the weakest amongst us, namely, our children. This comes  from  the
January statement.

What do we mean when we talk about abuse? Well, child  abuse  is  forcing  a
child to touch one; hitting and hurting a child, often to  relieve  our  own
frustrations, exposing a child to pornographic acts or literature,  touching
a child where or when he/she does not want to be touched, breaking down  the
self-confidence of a child, rape and incest, not sending a child to  school,
keeping a disabled child  at  home  because  parents  are  embarassed  about
having a disabled child, and the sexist neglect of a girl  child  in  favour
of a boy child.

The Freedom Charter specifically provides that we should teach  the  ``youth
to love their people and their culture,  to  honour  human  brotherhood  and
sisterhood, liberty  and  peace''.  These  values  should  inspire  all  our
people, both young and old. They should help us to recreate our  society  as
one that unites our society to fight against murder, violent crimes  against
persons, and the rape and abuse of women and children.

We should work to ensure that, in addition to improved law  enforcement,  we
succeed in mobilising all our people to join as one to fight  these  crimes,
especially those that violate  the  most  vulnerable  in  society,  such  as
children.

We know that our police force cannot work alone to get rid of all  the  evil
in our society.

It is our responsibity to take up our President's call for volunteerism  and
to remember that ``every child is my child.'' I applaud the policewoman  who
took a deaf boy under her wings after he had been badly  treated  and  found
tied to a table in his home. I applaud the volunteers  who  are  counsellors
for the victims of abuse at the Steenberg  police  station  trauma  unit  in
Cape Town.

 Our child protection  units  are  filled  with  overworked,  but  committed
policewomen  and  men  who  work  hard  to  find  and  arrest  perpetrators.
Perpetrators must be arrested and given the toughest sentence  that  can  be
handed down. Our courts must make sure of this.

Let me tell hon members about an incident that happened in my  constituency,
which  is  an  example  of  how  the  term  "child  abuse"  can   often   be
misinterpreted. I have been told that a representative from  the  provincial
department of education  accused  a  sign  languange  interpreter  of  child
abuse, thinking that she was speaking on behalf of deaf  pupils.  Four  deaf
pupils, who are attending a hearing  school,  expressed  their  views  about
preferring to attend a hearing school with full access to  a  sign  language
interpreter to attending a school for the deaf, where some  teachers  cannot
sign and the standard of education is lower than in hearing schools.

The interpreter does not speak for the deaf. She only  interprets  for  them
or voices over. Disabled children, like all children, have a  right  to  the
freedom of expression and the right to full access at any school.

In response to the outcry about child abuse and rape, a task group on  child
abuse has been set up in Parliament. Seven  portfolio  committees  form  the
task group. Their brief is to  conduct  public  hearings  on  the  abuse  of
children. The aim of the hearings is to get an understanding of  the  nature
of the crime, the gaps in existing legislation that  protects  children  and
the problems with current responses and protection systems.

Short-term and long-term recommendations will be  made  to  the  Government,
based on the outcome of these hearings. Yes, the ANC believes  that  in  our
struggle for a  truly  nonracial,  nonsexist  democratic  South  Africa,  we
cannot   separate   social   transformation   from   spiritual   and   moral
transformation.

We call on our communities to: one, strengthen the  cohesion  of  societies;
two, encourage co-operatione and collective commitment  to  the  improvement
of both the individual and society;  three,  respect  every  member  of  the
community; and, four, build a new society based on a sound value system.

Our work to build in South Africa a better life for all continues.

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, what is the definition of a good  leader?  A
good leader must find the correct  balance  between  fearlessness  and  even
unpopular guidance on  the  one  hand,  while  staying  in  touch  with  his
followers, on the other hand. The  hon  President  is  under  pressure  from
different pressure groups to change his economic vision  for  South  Africa,
yet he showed willingness to be  unpopular  with  some  by  stating  in  his
opening address that the path of an open economy that he has charted is  not
up for review. The FF congratulates him on this.

The President's success, which he achieved abroad recently with Nepad,  must
also be applauded. Unfortunately, in my seven minutes there is only time  to
discuss one issue, the sudden outreach from the ANC towards Afrikaners.

I have a mandate to speak on behalf of those who  voted  for  the  FF.  Yet,
listening to Afrikaner debates, I believe  I  reflect  the  opinion  of  the
majority: Dialogue with the ANC was our approach since 1993.  We  lost  many
votes in 1999 because we were too far  ahead  of  our  supporters  on  these
issues.

How serious is the ANC about really addressing Afrikaner issues?  Afrikaners
are confused because the ANC  sends  out  different  signals  towards  them.
Reading Prof Esterhuysen's report, one of the things the  Government  failed
to do was to recruit 30 000 reservists to help protect farms.  That  sent  a
signal.

Changing the names of only the Afrikaans towns in the Northern  Province  in
a two-week blitzkrig, without any real consultation, sends  a  message  that
Afrikaners are  not  welcome  in  that  province.  Yesterday  I  advised  an
Afrikaner industrialist to invest his money in another province.

At the same time, Mr  Lekota  reaches  out  to  Afrikaners,  praising  their
commitment to Africa and their expertise in helping to  make  a  success  of
South Africa.

I sat in this Chamber listening to ANC speeches for the past eight years.  I
listened to the speeches of the young ANC lions sitting there behind  us  in
the backbenches of  the  ANC,  emotional  speeches  whipping  up  people.  I
listened to the older ANC members over there, telling us  of  the  struggle,
everyone with a story of how he personnaly suffered, but also  dreaming  and
longing for the good old days of the struggle in which  politics  were  less
complicated.

 I listened to the ANC exiles, mostly sitting over  here,  telling  us  what
happened in South Africa while they were  away,  not  realising  that  their
versions of South African reality were tinted by  the  propaganda  angle  of
the source from which they obtained the information abroad.
The more I listened to ANC speeches, the more I became convinced  that  they
do not understand the Afrikaner. What makes the situation  so  dangerous  is
that they believe they do understand us perfectly. What was one of the  main
criticisms black people had against the National Party  government  and  its
policies? It was that the National Party thought they  knew  what  was  best
for black people and therefore decided on their behalf.

Listening  to  the  ANC  speeches  over  the  past  year,  I  get  the  same
impression. When we tell this House how  Afrikaners  experience  affirmative
action, the ANC answers  aggressively:  ``We  know  best.  You  are  typical
racist Afrikaners that resist change and transformation,'' without any  idea
of what is really happening to Afrikaners in the workplace.

Recent  research  at  Eskom  showed  how  the  practical  implementation  of
affirmative action  is  the  most  important  factor  in  the  hardening  of
Afrikaner attitudes at  the  moment.  When  we  speak  about  the  Afrikaans
language and  how  English  is  forcing  all  other  languages  out,  it  is
experienced as an attack on black people. One must  study  our  history.  We
resisted English in 1820  during  the  Anglo-Boer  War.  We  resisted  every
effort to anglicise us.

What a disappointment it was to arrive at Parliament  and  to  see  the  new
notice  boards  only  in  English.  We   proposed   using   four   languages
alternatively. I find it ironic that the FF is fighting more for the use  of
other languages than most of the mother-tongue speakers here  do.  When  the
FF fights for mother-tongue education, the ANC hears  that  we  want  to  go
back to the old education system before 1994.

Mr Asmal said the other day that the fact that Wits University and  RAU  are
4 km apart is the weird logic of apartheid. It shows  that  Mr  Asmal  still
does not understand the concept of  mother-tongue  education.  In  Brussels;
Belgium,  Mr  Asmal  will  find  the  French  university  and  the   Flemish
university only a few kilometres from each other. The same occurs in  Leuven
where the university split in the '60s for language and cultural reasons.

Is this also the weird logic of apartheid, or is it the principle of mother-
tongue education applied to tertiary  level?  When  we  argue  for  minority
rights and self-determination, the ANC hears secession and an  unwillingness
to play a role in South Africa. This is totally  wrong.  One  must  read  my
speeches and  my  lips  if  one  wants  to  know  how  I  offered  Afrikaner
expertise, explaining that when the South African ship goes down, we all  go
down together.

Self-determination is part of the solution, and not  an  opposing  solution.
One must read the debates in  Europe  and  at  the  United  Nations  on  how
minority rights and self-determination are propagated as  the  solution  for
plural societies - the only solution  that  succeeded  in  getting  the  co-
operation and loyalty of minority groups.

When the ANC launched their volunteer project, ANC officials  wrote  to  the
newspapers that Afrikaners were too selfish to take part in  such  campaign.
What nonsense! My sister's son attends the Afrikaans  primary  school  Anton
van Wouw, in Pretoria. This Afrikaans school has an agreement,  voluntarily,
with the Banareng Primary School in  Atteridgeville.  The  Afrikaans  school
donated computers to Banareng and  sponsored  Banareng  children  that  were
chosen to present their province at the  national  gymnastic  championships.
Banareng, again, taught the  Afrikaans  schoolchildren  how  they  can  make
money from their own vegetable garden at school.

Every year the 800 children from each  school  exchange  Christmas  presents
that they make themselves. At the moment, the parents at Anton van Wouw  are
helping Banareng with a bread project. The profit from every loaf  of  bread
sold is used to buy a brick. Banareng has  already  built  three  classrooms
from this project. Why does Anton van Wouw do this? Because they  are  anti-
black or racist?

In Bloemfontein Mrs Marie Basson started a project to  get  street  children
off the streets. She got them interested in the local library.  The  project
is so successful that the majority of these children were ready and  willing
this year to go back to school. What motives might she have? Racism?  Maybe,
those hon members do not understand Afrikaners?

I believe win-win solutions for South Africa  are  still  possible.  I  will
guide my follewers along this route. But I am not going to commit  political
suicide by deserting  the  interests  of  my  supporters,  because  the  ANC
expects it of me.

It is easy to be politically correct  in  this  House  by  not  telling  the
truth. The old NP government preferred to talk to the Matanzimas and not  to
the Mandelas during the 60's. The ANC and  the  President  must  decide  how
serious they are in reaching out towards Arikaners, ie whether  they  prefer
short-term Matanzima solutions and  bluff  themselves,  or  are  willing  to
tackle real Afrikaner problems and get permanent solutions.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, hon President, Deputy President and  hon
members, there is no doubt that South Africa  as  a  nation  wants  to  move
forward as a nation united by a common destiny to build a just  society  for
everyone. To quote our President Mbeki during his  address,  he  alluded  to
the fact that -


  ... During the past year our country has moved further forward towards  a
  society free of poverty and underdevelopment.

He went on to say, and I quote:


  We are nowhere near liberating millions of our people from this scourges.

The President could not have been more correct  on  this  point  this  time.
However,  more  concrete  action  is  needed  to  address   the   identified
challenges. It is on the basis of this statement that the  President  admits
that there is a  need  for  the  Government  to  rethink  its  strategy  and
approach on issues considered controversial from the Government's  point  of
view.

These same issues, if not addressed, will admittedly reverse all  the  gains
achieved by our Government. The question of HIV/Aids  threaten  to  decimate
the South African population and if it is not tackled headon, it will  spell
disaster. Once we acknowledged  the  Government's  reconciliatory  note,  we
expect more in terms of practical steps to be taken as far as  the  question
of providing HIV/Aids drugs is concerned.

We have noted with great interest that the Government  would  intensify  the
programme against HIV/Aids, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis  and
other communicable diseases. We would like to see  the  Minister  of  Health
announcing a healthy budget as a  concrete  step,  ensuring  that  what  the
President said becomes a reality.

It is clear that we have all come to the realisation that the debate  around
Aids should  centre  around  saving  lives  through  available,  tested  and
scientifically proven means. We already have the  information  and  what  is
left is for the Government to make these drugs  accessible  to  the  poorer,
who cannot afford them.

We need to advise the President that the fight against poverty should  be  a
priority and a multifaceted approach. There is no  doubt  that  the  biggest
cause of poverty is the high rate of unemployment and the inability  of  our
economy to grow at a level that would allow us  to  create  more  employment
opportunities. If not, the Government's Vukuzenzele campaign will  not  work
and will amount to a futile exercise.

We welcome the figures which state that more than 3,3  million  grants  were
paid out and that the Government is to  register  an  additional  3  million
children by 2002. We are therefore ready to measure  to  the  challenges  of
assisting the Government to meet these  targets  and  register  these  needy
children. The President has also made reference  to  the  inability  of  the
SMMEs'  to  access   finance   from   the   mainstream   banking   financial
institutions. It is a well-known fact that Khula and  Ntsika,  as  financial
institutions set up specifically to assist SMMEs',  are  not  responsive  to
the needs of the small entrepreneur.

On Nepad, we would like the Government to  accelerate  this  initiative  and
equally prioritise South Africa' development.

 The South African Government should not be viewed as  the  sole  driver  of
this process.

We would like to acknowledge that the R10 million contribution South  Africa
made to assist Mali to stage the Caf games in Mali  was  money  well  spent.
This serves  as  a  concrete  example  of  what  partnership  means  at  the
continental level. [Time expired].

Mr L M KGWELE: Madam Speaker, His Excellency  the  hon  the  President,  His
Excellency the hon the Deputy President, hon Ministers, hon members,  it  is
obvious from some of the inputs that have thus far been made in this  debate
that the state-of-the-nation address that the President delivered on  Friday
piqued the pious hopes and delusive views  of  some  of  the  desperate  and
destructive elements represented in  this  august  House,  particularly  the
``Deurmekaar Alliance'' and the UDM.
On behalf of  the  ANC  I  rise,  firstly,  to  commend  the  President  for
announcing momentous priority plans  for  implementation  by  Government  in
2002, and today's issues that affect the education  of  our  nation,  as  we
regard investment in people  as  one  of  our  key  strategies  towards  the
eradication of poverty,  disease,  illiteracy  and  violence,  which  remain
serious challenges hindering the pace of development.

The provision of opportunities for people to develop themselves in order  to
improve the quality of their lives and  the  standard  of  living  of  their
communities  remains  a  central  objective  of   the   Reconstruction   and
Development Programme.

The fundamental renewal  of  our  society  means  and  requires  developing,
maintaining and supporting a South African  education  and  training  system
for the 21st century, to attain the objectives  spelt  out  in  the  Freedom
Charter and the Reconstruction and Development Programme.

If one evaluates the progress registered in improving our  education  system
through the collective efforts  of  Government,  with  the  support  of  the
business sector,  donor  agencies,  sponsors,  private  individuals,  school
governing  bodies,  parents,  teacher  unions,  learners  and   communities,
Government has indeed made great strides in this regard.

Ruri kopano ke  maatla.  Mmogo  re  ka  potlakisa  diphetogo  go  fitlhelela
botshelo jo bo botoka go botlhe gonne tau di se  nang  seboka  di  siiwa  ke
none e tlhotsa. [Indeed, unity is the power. We will all  work  together  to
bring about a better life for all because  together  we  stand,  divided  we
fall.]

A lot can be achieved if we all respond positively to the  President's  call
to rise and act - vuk'uzenzele. The hon the President's call for the  nation
to unite in action for change presents all of us  with  the  opportunity  to
volunteer our time,  resources  and  expertise  to  contribute  towards  the
achievement of our national  task  of  reconstruction  and  development,  to
build a caring and  people-centred  society.  This  task  is  not  only  the
responsibility of Government; it is the task of all our people.

Letsema le thata ka mong wa lona. Mokodue go tsoswa  o  o  itsosang.  Re  le
setshaba re tshwanelwa ke go ikemela ka dinao, re tsee karolo  mo  go  ageng
le go sireletsa dikolo tsa rona. [We have to take part in the projects  that
we initiate. As the nation, we should stand on our feet and  participate  in
building and protecting our schools.]

To protect our children's future and in response to  the  President's  call,
we should together with Government fight  against  the  abuse  of  children,
vandalism, corruption, theft and the misuse of resources.

It is encouraging  and  commendable  that  education  remains  an  important
priority of Government, as can be seen by  the  allocation  of  21%  of  its
national Budget, that is R58,4  billion,  towards  education.  In  2001  the
President's Government made a long-term investment  that  lay  a  foundation
for a higher quality of life, great employment opportunities  and  a  better
skilled workforce, contrary to the canvassed impression that our  Government
spends a lot of money on defence.

It is commendable  that  our  Government  has  managed  to  bring  down  the
country's expenditure on defence from 9% to a reasonable  6%.  This  is  not
something that the opposition cares to inform the public about. This is  the
truth, nothing else but  the  truth.  Instead  they  feed  the  public  with
negative rhetoric.

 One of the truths that  they  do  not  inform  the  public  about  is  that
Government has done a lot within its limited resources to improve access  to
higher education, and that Government has allocated over  R2  billion  since
1994 towards the national student financial aid  scheme  to  assist  81  609
needy students from disadvantaged communities to pursue tertiary  education.
[Applause.]

We should all pride ourselves for having a Government that has  one  of  the
highest rates of investments in education in the  world  to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty and underdevelopment.

Indeed we are a  winning  nation.  Maybe  we  need  to  take  stock  of  our
successes and appreciate what the  rest  of  the  continent  and  the  world
appreciate in and about us. Have we listened too long to the hon Leon,  some
bites that we have forgotten who he really is, what we are  capable  of  and
how we ought to be going as a nation. Maybe the hon President  could  assist
by sharing with us as to what is it that the rest of the  world  appreciates
about South Africa, and South Africans.

It is gratifying that the Government, through  the  Tirisano  programme  has
prioritised and is giving attention  to  the  implementation  of  norms  and
standards for funding of schools to promote equity; sustaining the  improved
the matric results through intervention such  as  whole  school  evaluation;
eliminating  of  the  illiteracy  among  adults  and  youth;  improving  the
rehabilitation of schools; addressing issues of HIV/Aids  in  the  education
and training sector; developing the professional quality  of  our  teachers;
and, improving Maths, Science and Technology in our schools.

It is also critical that we extend the net of our primary  school  nutrition
programme to also reach learners  than  the  current  4 719  489  that  have
beneffitted from it, and the adoption of the  human  resource  strategy  and
the national plan for higher education. However,  I  also  believe  that  we
should do more to improve access to higher education by  ensuring  that  our
youth from rural areas and poor urban families  find  it  easier  to  access
financial  assistance  to  register  for  tertiary   education,   and   that
recognition of prior knowledge is recognised by our institutions  of  higher
learning to  enable  the  multitutes  of  our  people  who  were  denied  an
opportunity to study by the previous system.

The hon President has reminded us in his address that the  restructuring  of
higher learning will not be an easy one. Indeed we agree with him  that  the
restructuring must be done if we are to meet the country's  needs  for  high
level human  resource.  It  must  be  done  if  we  are  to  produce  future
generations  of  black  intellectuals  and  researchers.  Although  the  hon
Minister of Education has clearly stated on  numerous  occassions  that  the
restructuring of higher education will not lead to closure of any  sites  of
learning, there is still a great deal  of  uncertainty  which  needs  to  be
addressed.  If  need  be,  Government  must  re-assure  the  public  of  the
continued  provision  of  higher  education  in  institutions  such  as  the
University of Transkei in Umtata.

The restructuring process must not be  held  at  ransom  by  individuals  or
institutions. We have already seen examples of such  resistance  to  change.
It is unfortunate that such resistance to transformation is  dressed  up  in
other guises. Let us be clear that the  current  restructuring  exercise  is
nowhere an assult on academic freedom  as  freedom  is  safeguarded  in  the
Constitution and the Higher Education Act.

We have confidence that Government will ensure that  the  process  does  not
only temper with historically disadvantaged institutions  to  the  exclusion
of historically advataged institutions.

Sedikwa ke ntswapedi ga se thata. Ke a leboga.

It was an honour to participate in this debate. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, President and Deputy President, a nation  with
many desperate needs is bound to have unusually high  expectations.  Such  a
nation looks up to its Parliament, Government and President  for  some  sign
of hope. This makes our task this session extraordinary.

As we sit in this Parliament, we can hear the deafening groans of the  poor,
who have carried the burden of racial oppression for  many  years  and  were
hoping that the new democratic dispensation would  bring  changes  in  their
lives. Instead of changes, they watch with disbelief as  the  ranks  of  the
unemployed swell daily. With inflation reducing  the  buying  power  of  the
rand, their meagre resources bring very few goods home.
We also have Aids  victims  and  potential  victims  who  thought  that  the
President would make Aids the main subject of his address. They  hoped  that
the President would propose that the nation declare war on Aids.

Those who have borne the brunt of apartheid rule  find  that  they  are  the
ones who are still at the bottom of society's ladder.  The  only  change  is
that they can now vote for the government of the day -  actually,  they  did
vote twice for this Government.

This Parliament was told triumphantly by the  President  that  ``the  people
have spoken.'' I wish to agree with the President that, indeed,  the  people
have  spoken.  But  does  he  really  understand  what  they   are   saying?
[Interjections.] Surely they were not saying that it is fine to  starve,  to
be unemployed or to be homeless? They were not saying that it  is  fine  not
to have land on which to stay.

The informal settlements are increasing daily. For  people  in  a  desperate
situation to be told by their  Government  to  ``go  back  where  they  come
from'' was gross insensitivity. It was a kick in the  teeth  to  people  who
live under the open sky in the land of their own ancestors.

On the question of land, the people are not asking to have a share  of  only
13% of the land.  This  is  a  wrong  assumption  which  is,  unfortunately,
common. They clearly are want - and are entitled to - a  share  of  100%  of
the land. Nobody is suggesting that this is an easy problem. The  people  of
this nation must solve this problem.

We have long called  for  a  national  summit  on  the  land  problem.  With
respect, this Government, this party alone cannot  solve  the  problem.  The
Government had 65% of the vote, but has less than 13% of the land. With  all
its best intentions,  this  Government  cannot  deliver  on  its  own:  this
national problem needs all the parties, all the landowners -  including  the
churches - and all the people whose moneys are tied up in land.

If all the stakeholders can act together in one  spirit  of  love  for  this
country, that can bring new hope for  our  nation.  Without  addressing  and
solving this problem, there is just no fitire or  peace  for  this  beatiful
country of ours.

The  ostrich  tactic  of  hiding  our  heads  in  the  Zimbabwean  sand   is
irresponsible and dishonest in the  extreme.  The  Zimbabwean  farmers,  who
should have been part of a land indaba, are only now debating the  solution,
and I am told  that  two  thirds  of  the  farmers  there  now  support  the
government's plan of allowing them to keep one good farm and  then  let  the
rest be distributed to the landless.

I want to believe  that  our  farmers  in  this  country,  who  are  closely
attached to the soil and therefore to this country, the  authentic  Africans
who love the smell of the soil of the country, would  not  disagree  with  a
fair, sensible formula which will bring peace to our country.

The African Union parliament which is meeting in our country in  July  is  a
major achievement for Africa and for the President of our country.
Let us, however, not trivialise it by turning it into an ANC event. We,  all
of us, need to rise and mark this event  with  the  dignity  and  historical
consciousness that it deserves. Remember that we are surrounded by  a  cloud
of witnesses who have laid down their lives for this dream,  and  they  will
be celebrating this event with us.

  The unity of Africa and the long delayed development that must come  from
  this unity are issues of great importance for this  continent  and  those
  who love it. This brings to mind the words of Zeph Mothopeng:
  Unite, unite, all you Africans, unite, and rally to the banner of African
  nation. Promote, project the African personality  and  create  one  giant
  monolinguistic state of Africa.

... or the words of our national anthem:


  Nkosi sikelel' Afrika ...


  Morena boloka setshaba sa heso [God bless our land]
  Yiva imithandazo yethu [Hear our prayers]


  Usikelele [Bless us].

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I listened attentively  to  the  the  hon
the President's speech on Friday. It gave me a lot of food for thought,  not
so much on what he said, but that which he did not say. It puts my  mind  on
what his ideals are for our country.

We accept many of the things that he said. We all want  a  successful  South
Africa, we all want a successful Africa. The reason for the  differences  is
not so much the ideals, but the approach and the method according  to  which
we want to achieve them.

If one looks at the African Renaissance, which is the President's topic,  we
find that for Africa to succeed, South Africa must succeed. If South  Africa
does not succeed, Africa  will  not  succeed.  For  that  we  need  the  co-
operation of all the people of  South  Africa.  We  also  need  to  position
ourselves in such a way that the international world should also accept  our
position, because we cannot just deal with matters on our own, in  isolation
of what is happening in the rest of the world.

Unfortunately, some of our current points  of  view  in  terms  of  Aids  or
Zimbabwe do not offer any hope of co-operation internationally.  Our  points
of view are questioned and that creates a problem. That is why aid does  not
come to our country. People ask the question: If this is  your  position  on
Aids, what will your position be on other things? That is  why  I  say  that
clarity is important.

Dit bring my by 'n volgende punt:  werkloosheid.  Waar  ek  op  die  oomblik
besig is met 'n tussenverkiesing op  plaaslike  vlak,  loop  ek  tussen  arm
mense rond. Die meeste van hulle is werkloos. Daar is nie werk nie,  en  die
vraag is,  hoewel  die  President  aangekondig  het  dat  sosiale  pensioene
verhoog  gaan  word,  wat  van  die  werklose?  (Translation  of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[This brings me to  my  next  point:  unemployment.  Where  I  am  currently
involved with by elections at the local level, I  walk  among  poor  people.
Most of them are unemployed. There is no work, and  the  question  is,  even
though the President has announced that social pensions will  be  increased,
what about the unemployed?]

What is the hon the President's position? What are we going to do?  I  would
like to help the President as far as I can. People have  no  income  and  no
money, and food prices - eg for commodities such as maize -  have  over  the
last couple of years increased by  over  60%.  People  do  not  have  money.
Somewhere we would like to see a plan on the table from  the  Government  of
the day on how we are going to deal with this.

My other point concerns land reform. We all have  a  role  to  play  on  the
question of land reform, as the leader of the PAC  has  just  said.  We  all
share that ideal, and we would like to do that. Again, it is a  question  of
methods. If we do not succeed  with  land  reform,  South  Africa  will  not
succeed.

With all due respect to the Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,
which is doing its best to facilitate a  better  land  reform,  they  cannot
succeed because the expertise for doing that is outside the  department.  If
we do not have the farmers, the private sector and the bankers  included  in
this programme, we will not succeed.

Daar is geweldig baie welwillendheid daar buite. Ons moet 'n manier vind  om
dit bymekaar te kry. Op die  oomblik  slaag  ons  nie  daarin  nie.  Dit  is
absoluut belangrik dat ons dit moet doen. As ons dit nie doen nie,  sal  ons
verlore wees.

Geluk met die  program  wat  met  Agri-SA  daargestel  is.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There is an incredible amount of goodwill out there. We must find a way  to
harness it. At the moment we are not succeeding in this. It is  of  absolute
importance that we do this. If we do not do this, we will be lost.

Congratulations on the programme established with Agri-SA.]

This is the new approach to agriculture. Again, there is  a  question  mark.
Will that be just words or will it facilitate, in  the  end,  getting  South
Africa out of the doldrums?

'n Laaste punt: ek sien die President het nuwe  bondgenote  gekry.  Ek  wens
hom sterkte toe vir  sy  samewerking  met  hulle.  Vorige  ondervinding  van
samewerking met sy nuwe bondgenote, wat voorheen in die  DA  was,  toon  dat
dit meer te doene gehad met persoonlike politieke oorlewing as met sake  van
landsbelang wat die toekoms van demokrasie in Suid-Afrika sou bepaal.

Die parlementêre leiers van die Nuwe NP het ook sterkte nodig.  Dit  is  nie
die eerste keer dat die Nuwe  NP  en  die  ANC  wil  saamwerk  nie.  In  die
onderhandelings met die oorgangsgrondwet het  die  Nuwe  NP  agtergekom  hoe
hard die ANC kan onderhandel.

Tydens die Regering van Nasionale Eenheid het ons  gevind  hoe  moeilik  dit
is. Dit het  tandekners  gegaan  met  meerderheidsoorheersing.  As  'n  mens
saamstem, is jy 'n held, verskil jy, dan is jy 'n rassis.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
Die Nuwe NP het probeer saamwerk in daardie tyd, ten spyte van De Klerk  wat
dit reggekry het, en die nuwe leier van die Nuwe NP is nie De Klerk nie.  Ek
het hul leier vandag hoor praat, en al wat ek kan  sê  is:  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[A last point: I see the hon the President has acquired some  new  alliances
I wish him all the best in his co-operation with them.  Previous  experience
of co-operation with his new alliances,  who  were  previously  in  the  DA,
indicates that it had more to do with personal political survival than  with
issues of national interest which would determine the  future  of  democracy
in South Africa.

The parliamentary leaders of the New NP also require fortitude. This is  not
the first time that the New NP and the ANC have  sought  to  co-operate.  In
the negotiations at  the  time  of  the  interim  constitution  the  New  NP
realised how hard the ANC can negotiate.

During the Government of National Unity we  found  out  how  difficult  this
was. There was some gnashing of teeth associated with  majority  domination.
If one agreed, one was a hero, if one  differed,  then  one  was  a  racist.
[Interjections.] The New NP did attempt to co-operate during that  time,  in
spite of the fact that De Klerk achieved this, and the  new  leader  of  the
New NP is not De Klerk. I heard their leader speak today, and all I can  say
is:]

I heard the hon member speak under De Klerk, I heard him  speak  under  Tony
Leon, I heard him speak today,  and  I  wonder  what  he  is  going  to  say
tomorrow. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker,  the  address  by  the  President  on  8
February 2002 touched on core  issues  such  as  poverty  eradication,  land
reform, housing, black economic empowerment, as  well  as  the  position  of
traditional leaders in our society. Indeed, the state  is  obliged  to  take
positive action to meet the needs of those living in extreme  conditions  of
poverty, homelessness, or in intolerable housing.

These socioeconomic rights need to be dealt with  and  understood  in  their
historical and social context, given the legacy of deep social  inequalities
that emanate from our past.  Millions of black people live in conditions  of
grave deprivation. The high level of unemployment,  the  inaccessibility  of
clean water, electricity, food, and adequate health services  testify  daily
to the miserable conditions in which black  men,  women  and  children  find
themselves.

Azapo believes that it is possible to put into place sustainable  programmes
that are geared at the eradication of all forms of  deprivation  that  black
people live under. However, these programmes cannot succeed if, at the  same
time, the Government is not prepared to  discuss  the  macroeconomic  policy
that sometimes gets our people out of jobs.

We should take cognisance of the fact that, up to now,  Government  has  not
paid  much  attention  to  the  quality  of  houses  built  by  construction
companies contracted to Government. Azapo is not at all  encouraged  by  the
mere mention of the statistical figure of 1,2 million units which have  been
built.  To us it is not the number of  units  built  that  counts,  but  the
quality. If indeed, we want to create a better life for all,  then,  surely,
we should also, at the same time, build better houses for all?

Government should, as a matter  of  urgency,  establish  a  coherent  public
housing programme controlled by a state-run housing company that  will  work
towards the progressive realisation of the rights to access to adequate  and
decent housing.

Azapo welcomes the announcement that Comrade Bantu Biko will  be  recognised
and honoured for his contribution to the liberation of our land and  people.
Azapo will do all in its power to work with all interested parties  to  make
the 25th anniversary commemoration a success. Despite the fact that  Comrade
Biko is one of the founder members of our movement, the black  consciousness
philosophy, we have always had the view that he and  many  other  heroes  of
our struggle are symbols of the black struggle and its collective efforts.

Azapo supports Government's efforts to create a conducive condition for  the
people of Zimbabwe to determine their own destiny. We do not want to  choose
who the president of Zimbabwe should be, but the people of Zimbabwe  should.


Azapo is  encouraged  by  the  commitment  of  Government  to  finalise  the
position, role and functions of traditional leaders.  We  find  it  strange,
though, that a black government does  not  seem  to  understand  the  roles,
responsibilities and functions of traditional leaders. The black people  are
in the majority, and, yet, positive aspects of their  traditions  and  norms
have not as yet been incorporated into our  emerging  democratic  processes.
Those who colonised us like it when we despise our traditions. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I congratulate you, hon member. It is not often  that  a
maiden speech receives a warm hug from the  leader  of  a  political  party.
[Laughter.]

The  MINISTER  OF  LABOUR:  Madam  Speaker,  Comrade  President  and  Deputy
President, it is not my  intention  today  to  remind  hon  members  of  our
painful history - of the time when Bantu  Education  was  crafted  with  the
sole purpose of relegating and condemning black students to  being  ``hewers
of wood and drawers of water'' and of the time when young  people  who  were
black were forbidden  from  entering  apprenticeships  to  learn  craft  and
acquire skills that are economy demanded. It is not my  intention  today  to
remind my highly esteemed colleagues in this House of the  time  when  young
black students were  fed  inferior  education  by  unqualified  teachers  in
overcrowded classrooms; of the time when blacks  were  forced  to  study  in
severely under-resourced racially segregated universities; of the time  when
workers who were black were denied quality training and thus  denied  access
to decent jobs, and of the time  when  entrepreneurs  who  were  black  were
prevented from trading in urban areas. No, it is  not  necessary  to  remind
hon members of these things because we are all conversant with this  painful
past, including those teams that are making noise on my  left.  But  I  must
ask hon members to remember that atrocious policies of apartheid  have  left
us with an invidious and unenviable legacy which will take many  decades  to
reverse.

The damage caused by our painful past continues to permeate  and  negatively
affect the tapestry of our economy and  fabric  of  our  society.  Too  many
children are still failing at school because  their  schools  have  not  yet
recovered from decades of neglect; too many adults  are  illiterate  because
they were denied schooling; too many workers have  too  few  skills  because
they were denied training opportunities; our small business sector is under-
developed because of the trading restrictions  of  the  past;  and  many  of
those who are white  and  were  privileged  to  be  given  quality  learning
opportunities have used their privileges  to  flee  democracy,  leaving  the
country with huge skills gap.
As a result of this stupedous mess we have inherited from our painful  past,
many would-be  investors  think  twice  before  investing  in  our  country,
fearful that their profits will not be realised.

It was against this background that our President announced  South  Africa's
first human resource development strategy during last year's  State  of  the
Nation address.  The  overarching  goals  of  the  strategy  are  ambitious,
including an improvement on the human development index for South Africa,  a
reduction  in  inequality  and  a  higher  position  on  the   international
competitive table.

The HRD  strategy  looks  at  all  aspects  of  learning  and  supports  the
development of our people from soon after birth to well into  maturer  years
with the aim of achieving - in the words of our  President,  ``a  nation  at
work for a better life for all.'' The aim of the HRD strategy is to  improve
the foundations for  human  development,  to  improve  the  supply  of  high
quality skills, to increase employer participation in lifelong learning  and
to support employment growth to industrial  policies,  innovation,  research
and development.

It is common knowledge that only a minority of school leavers  are  able  to
progress to higher education while the  majority  face  a  bleak  future  of
unemployment or employment in low skilled jobs. And sadly, in  recent  years
this pool of people have been joined in the labour market by those who  have
been retrenched, and  even  by  those  graduates  who  have  completed  high
education programmes but are enable to secure jobs.

  The  HRD  strategy  looks  at  all  aspects  of  learning  supporting  the
development of our people from soon after birth to their mature  years  with
the aim of achieving, In the words of our Honourable President.  The  nation
at work for a better life for all.  The  aim  of  the  HRD  strategy  is  to
improve foundations for  human  development,  improve  the  supply  of  high
quality skills increase employer participation  in  life-long  learning  and
support employement growth to industrial policies innovation,  research  and
development.
It is common comrades and friends, that only a minority  of  school  leavers
are able to progress to higher education while the  majority  face  a  bleek
future of unemployment or employment in low  skill  jobs.  Sadly  in  recent
years this pool of people have been joined in the  labour  market  by  those
who have been retchened and even by those graduates who have completed  high
education programmes but have been unable to secure work.

The  HRD  strategy  has  triggered  a  new  set  of  bursaries  in   certain
professional  fields.  For   instance   management,   especially   financial
management and information and communication  technology  these  are  to  be
funded from the national skill fund established by  the  Skills  Development
Act. I hope to announce achievement to Combrade President of the  target  of
1000 bursaries before the end of March  this  years  in  the  above  mention
skills, unfortunately the  Honourable  Member  Bantu  Holomisa  who  damaged
Transkei is not in the House now to listen to this.

In the Honourable President's state  of  the  nation  adress  the  President
expressed urgence to establish an ICT university. This  call could not  have
come at a better time as electronic commerce begins to desplace  traditional
trading nethods South Africa is to become a leading  supplier  of  knowledge
intensive goods and services given its strategic location on  the  continent
and its state of the art communication infra-structural  network.  But  this
is not to be unless we adress the skills defasite which  is  notouriasly  in
international competitiveness. Not only will the ICT university  expand  the
quality and quantity of ICT skills among  historically  disadvataged  people
but will undoubtably also enormously contribute to our economic growth  into
a moral development, job creation and poverty alliviation.

Our approach to the challegeways by the Honourable President in relation  to
funds allocated to the national skills funds  Umsobomvu  employment  subcidy
is too fold. On the one hand we are seeking to be responding  to  the  ideas
and initiatives of communities themselves. By providing  training  funds  to
help prepare local people  to  participate  in  local  economic  development
project.

There are many exiciting examples of projects already undertaken such micro-
interprise support. 80% of the 200 million that the  provinsial  offices  of
our department are responsible for dis had  already  incommited  by  January
this year and 55% had actually spent.

On the one hand within this financial year we  intend  to  announce  funding
allocations to 23 large scales strategic initiatives  sector  education  and
training authorities. Targeting support for emerging  firms  and  vulnerable
workers within each of these sectors.This is even a project targeting micro-
lenders managed by banksitter. The total funds allocated  to  this  projects
exseed a billion rand over the next three years.

In areas where skills are scarce such as ICT engineering managerial  skills.
With regards to the wages incentives  aimed  at  encourage  job  creation  a
draft amendment to the Income Tax Act has now  been  perpared  and  will  be
circulated for public comment. the proposal is for the tax incentive of  R25
000 to employers  who  provide  learnerships.  It  is  anticipated  Combrade
President that they will be a massive response from employers and that  many
thousands  of  people  will  begin   to   enjoy   quality   based   learning
opportunities.

As  regards  to  learnership  the  new  work  based  training  programme  is
promising we have set ourselves the target of  3000  learners  by  March  of
this year.

I can assure the hon Comrade President that we will reach  our  target  with
the new intake this year. Otherwise, I know that he will hang  me  if  I  do
not reach that 3 000 by March 2002.

I would like to tell the hon Comrade President that progress in  the  public
sector has been much better, as indeed it should be. My  colleague  the  hon
the Minister for Public Service and  Administration  has  ensured  that  the
public service Seta was established last year. Samti, the  State  Management
Training Institute has trained some 13 000 managers. A number of  milestones
have been achieved in enhancing our capacity to  support  employment  growth
to industrial policies innovation and research.

Mhlali-ngaphambili noMongameli,  ingaba  andenzi  okulungileyo  ukuba  ngaba
andinakuthi: aba abasichasayo, ngamatyutyusi  amagwala.  Le  ngxoxo  ithande
ukuba yigxogxa. Ke ziza kutsala nzima iziqihela nezinyhola  ezifana  nelungu
elihloniphekileyo uBantu Holomisa.

Into endiyibonayo kuye kukuqhaqheka  nokuqaqadeka.  Andiqondi  ukuba  angabe
aqhuqheke.  Makangxeng'  umoya   ke   uDlamini,   angazikrazuli   umphefumlo
ngezilengetyana  ezifana  noBantu.  Mna  ndicinga  ukuba  unokuba   uyagula,
unenkenqe. Kungenjalo, unesifo sokulibala.

Ube  enalo  ithuba  angalisebenzisanga  ngeliya  xesha   ebephethe   kweliya
laphesheya kweNciba. Indlala egqubayo kweli lizwe, ngakumbi  phaya  phesheya
kweNciba,   ayidalwangwa,   ingabangelwanga   yiANC   nakukukhokela   kwakhe
uMongameli,  ungoyena  ongomnye   wabantu   abangunobangela   wenxele   lika
khetsekile elithwaxa abantu phesheya kweNciba.

Silwa imfazwe, silwa amadabi': Utsho oka Nkuhlu, uSobantu, kwenye  yeencwadi
zakhe. Ewe, akumnandanga ukulwa imfazwe. Kodwa asina kuba  sajika.  Ndiswele
nje umnqayi, kuba ngendigweba iimbambo  zincazelane.  Ndiswele  nje  iqwili,
ndiswele    ingxam     ngendibethelela,     ngendibekela,     ngendikhafula,
ngendithsuthsuza, ndichile, ndithi: embo kuba  umhlola  thina  siwukhombile.
Iqwili, uMongameli ulithe thaca phambi kwethu.

Masileleze ke, sidomboze, ngendlela alikhokele ngalo uDlamini eli lizwe  loo
baw' mkhulu. Izinja zikhonkotha inqwelo ehambayo, emileyo  ziyayintsontsela,
yaye nengasebenziyo ikholisa ukuzalela iinkuku.

Yiyo ke loo nto ndithe makhe ndimncacazele  uMongameli  kwezi  zibongo  zika
Sobantu Nkuhlu  ukuze  akhe  arhabule  kuzo.  Yena  ke  uwuchanile  umhlola,
neqwili unisinikile. Kushiyeke ukuba singxashe,  sisonge  imikhono,  singene
endimeni  ngoba  unyaka  uwuvule  ngokunxiba  i-avarolo,   wafaka   ikepusi,
wabonisa  abantu  abaphephezelisa  amaqhina   ukuba   ayakhululwa   amaqhina
kusetyenzwe.

Kulo mbandela waseZimbabwe, xa ndivala, ndiyayibulela  kakhulu  mna  indlela
uMongameli awuphethe ngayo.  Ubuchule  nobunono  awubambe  ngawo  lo  mcimbi
ugqwesa uhlobo iBrithane, iMelike kunye noManyano lwaseYurophu  oluthe  bona
bawubamba  ngayo.  Ngelishwa,  bayawugabangxa  lo  mcimbi.  Ngumbandela   lo
ongafuni zindlongondlongo ezijonge inzuzo yexeshana.  Ngumba  ofuna  umonde,
ngumba ofuno unonophelo.

Inkani ayigotywa ngenkani. Abo ke abasebenzisa inkani  yesele  mabazi  ukuba
uxam wakholwa  ngamantintinti.  Mabakulumkele  ke  ukukhasela  eziko,  hata.
[kwaqhwatywa] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Let me say to the hon the President that I would not be doing justice if  I
do not mention the fact that the opposition  are  cowards.  This  debate  is
turning into a yawn. So retards such as hon  Bantu  Holomisa  are  going  to
have a tough time.

I see him as a loose cannon. I think he is beyond redemption.  I  appeal  to
Dlamini not to allow himself to be worked up by nobodies such  as  Bantu.  I
think he is either sick, a psycho or is suffering from amnesia.

He had an opportunity, which he could have used, when he was at the helm  in
the former Transkei. The poverty prevalent in this  country,  especially  in
the former Transkei, is not a creation of the ANC, nor  did  it  come  about
when the ANC came to power,  neither  did  it  arise  from  the  President's
leadership. Hon Bantu Holomisa is one of the  people  whose  actions  caused
poverty in the former Transkei.

``We are fighting wars and battles'', so says Sobantu Nkuhlu in one  of  his
books. Yes, it is not nice being involved in wars, but there is  no  turning
back. I wish I had a stick, which I would have  used  to  visit  justice  on
someone. I wish I had herbs, which I would have  used  to  drive  away  evil
spirits, because we have pointed out the way. The President has provided  us
with the cure.

 We must show our appreciation and be grateful to Dlamini for the manner  in
which he has led this country of our forefathers. Dogs bark at a moving  car
... [Interjections] ... urinate ... [Applause] ... against a stationary  one
... [Laughter] ... and the car which is no longer in working  order  becomes
a nest for hens.

That is the reason I thought I  should  share  with  the  President  one  of
Sobantu Nkuhlu's poems. He has hit the nail on the head,  and  has  provided
the cure. All that remains is for us to get ourselves  ready,  roll  up  our
sleeves and start working, because he started off the  year  by  putting  on
overalls and a cap and showing the people in ties that  sometimes  ties  are
taken off so that people can work.

In conclusion, regarding the issue of Zimbabwe, I personally am  happy  with
the way the President has handled it. The skill and finesse  with  which  he
handled this matter far surpasses the manner in which Britain,  America  and
the European Union  handled  it.  Unfortunately  they  are  mishandling  the
issue. This is a matter not for criminals looking for cheap gains.  This  is
a matter that should be handled with patience and care.

One should not fight fire with fire. Those  who  go  against  advice  should
know that ``He who will not listen, will be made to feel.'' They  should  be
careful not to play with fire, for they will be burned. [Applause.]]

Debate Interrupted.

1.    The Minister for the Public Service and Administration:


     Written Explanation, dated 6 December 2001, from the Minister  for  the
     Public Service and Administration in terms of section 65(2)(a)  of  the
     Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1  of  1999),  setting  out
     reasons why  the  Annual  Report  and  Financial  Statements  of  State
     Information Technology Agency for 2000-2001  could  not  be  tabled  in
     time:


     Dear Dr Frene Ginwala


     DELAYED SUBMISSION OF STATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGENCY (SITA) ANNUAL
     REPORT 2000/2001 FINANCIAL YEAR


     With reference to the above, the State  Information  Technology  Agency
     (SITA) has not been able to timeously submit its Annual Report for  the
     2000/2001 Financial Year because of the following reasons:


     - Delays in the finalisation of the content of the  report,  especially
         by external auditors. The Report was kept for at  least  two  weeks
         by each of the external auditors (PWC and MSGM), working on  behalf
         of the Auditor-General's Office.
     -  The  Auditor-General  took  three  weeks  with  the  report   before
         authorising SITA to go ahead with its final printing.
     - These delays outlined above, resulted in SITA not being able to  meet
         printer's deadlines.


     However, the Annual Report has been  printed  and  will  be  tabled  to
     Parliament on 7 December 2001.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Defence  on  the  Joint
     Investigation Report into the Strategic Defence  Procurement  Packages,
     dated 5 December 2001:


         The Joint Standing Committee  on  Defence,  having  considered  the
         matters  in  the  Report  falling  within  the  parameters  of  its
         portfolio, in particular Chapters 3-7  and  10-12,  and  having  to
         report on the relevant findings and recommendations by  6  December
         2001 (ATC No 153, p 1441), reports as follows:


         A. Introduction


              On 15 November 2001, the Joint Investigative  Team  (hereafter
              the Agencies),  which  investigated  certain  aspects  of  the
              Strategic  Defence   Packages,   presented   its   report   to
              Parliament. Although aspects of the  investigation  are  still
              under way, the Agencies managed to complete most of the  tasks
              within its mandate. We note the findings  of  the  Report  and
              congratulate the Agencies for  their  work  in  compiling  the
              Report.


              This  Report  of  the  Committee  strives  to  make   concrete
              suggestions regarding the following:


              1.  Identifying the key strategic issues raised in the Report,
                  which require consideration by both the executive and  the
                  parliamentary committees on defence.


              2.  Making various  process  recommendations  as  to  how  the
                  findings of the Report can be taken forward.


         B. Role of Parliament


              According to the Defence Review (chapter on Acquisition),  the
              Committee has a key role  in  monitoring  and  overseeing  the
              Ministry of Defence, Armscor and  the  Department  of  Defence
              (DoD)  on  any  acquisition  process.  This  role  should   be
              strengthened through the institution of  appropriate  Standard
              Operating  Procedures  between  the   relevant   parliamentary
              committees  on  defence  and  the   Ministry   regarding   the
              management of any acquisition process.


              The rationale for involving the  parliamentary  committees  on
              defence in these decisions is as follows:


              1.  All major procurement programmes are capital-intensive  by
                  nature  and,  as  such,  require   substantial   financial
                  outlays from the fiscus. Parliament approves  the  defence
                  budget and therefore has an interest in ensuring that  any
                  financial outlays are managed according to the budget.
              2.  The mandate of the parliamentary committees on defence  is
                  to provide oversight over the  key  policy  processes  and
                  developments within both Armscor and the DoD, and as  such
                  any  acquisition  project  represents   a   major   policy
                  position for both Armscor and the DoD.


              3.   All  major  procurement  programmes   are   fundamentally
                  strategic  by  nature,  and  as  such  the   parliamentary
                  committees on defence have  a  responsibility  to  oversee
                  both Armscor and the DoD on the strategic implications  of
                  such packages.


              4.  Sub-optimal equipment will not  only  affect  the  SANDF's
                  combat-readiness, but also  the  lives  of  those  persons
                  operating such equipment. Parliament and  its  committees,
                  as  the  political  custodians  of  the  national  defence
                  function, have a moral and a political  responsibility  to
                  ensure that all acquisition  purchases  conform  to  basic
                  operational and security standards.


                  The parliamentary committees on  defence  should  play  an
                  important role in advising the Ministry, Armscor  and  the
                  DoD on the strategic aspects  of  such  packages  and  the
                  political  sensitivity  of  any  proposed  purchases.   To
                  perform these tasks adequately, it is  critical  that  the
                  parliamentary committees  on  defence  in  particular  and
                  other related parliamentary committees in  general  should
                  develop the necessary capacity and planning schedules  and
                  receive  the  necessary  resources  to  acquit  themselves
                  capably.


         C. Security clearance


              The status of security clearances within both Armscor and  the
              DoD needs to be investigated as a matter of  urgency.  Updates
              of existing security clearances and  vetting  of  non-security
              cleared personnel need to be effected as a matter of priority.


              In cases where there  was  a  breach  of  security  directives
              and/or  legislation  in  the  defence   procurement   process,
              necessary steps needs to be taken.


         D. Record-keeping


              Control over internal Armscor and DoD documentation and record-
              keeping  needs  to  be  improved  in  accordance  with   those
              procedures governing the control of classified information  as
              set out by the counter-intelligence function of  the  DoD.  An
              audit trail of all processes linked to  procurement  processes
              needs to be maintained and managed at all times.


         E. Acquisition policy


              Current Armscor and DoD procurement policy compares favourably
              with previous procurement policies that pertained within  both
              Armscor and the DoD in the past. Aspects  of  the  procurement
              policy do need to be fine-tuned,  and  personnel  within  both
              Armscor and the DoD  need  to  be  made  conversant  with  the
              content and the importance of this policy. This  will  require
              the institution of appropriate training and workshops, as well
              as Standard Operating Procedures within Armscor and  the  DoD,
              to ensure that this is accomplished.


              Each phase of the  procurement  process  should  be  concluded
              according to policy prescripts before proceeding to  the  next
              phase. Furthermore, proper authorisation should be obtained at
              each  phase  before  continuing.  Such  authorisations  should
              determine whether the next phase is embarked upon.


              Considerations such as the strategic  objectives  of  the  DoD
              that impact on the procurement process, should be weighted and
              form part of  the  value  system.  It  must  then  be  applied
              consistently throughout the process.


              Future defence procurement  packages  need  to  be  critically
              assessed against the needs of the current strategic and global
              environment.


              The Defence Review states that procurement should, as  far  as
              possible, attempt  to  make  use  of  local  defence  industry
              capabilities.  The   Report   notes   that   foreign   defence
              capabilities were privileged over domestic  capabilities.  The
              parliamentary committees believe that this situation needs  to
              be  avoided  if  local  defence  capabilities,  an  undisputed
              national strategic asset, are to be maintained.


         F. Armscor Act


              A Work Group that had to deal with the drafting of the Armscor
              Act, was established by the Ministry  of  Defence  in  January
              2000. We are concerned that there was not sufficient  feedback
              to Parliament. This should be  attended  to  as  a  matter  of
              urgency, given certain observations by the Agencies.


              The role of Armscor and the DoD with regard to  subcontracting
              needs to be clarified. We understand in the Report that it  is
              not the policy of  Armscor  and  the  DoD  to  interfere  with
              subcontractors, yet numerous  instances  of  interference  are
              mentioned. Whilst Armscor has  the  right  to  interfere  with
              subcontracting,  it  must  do  so  within  the  framework   of
              government policies vis-á-vis affirmative  procurement,  black
              empowerment and technical and strategic needs.


              Armscor as the procurement agency of the DoD, as  mandated  by
              law, should resume this responsibility when the  DoD  procures
              defence equipment.


         G. Cheetah fighters


              The Report observes that the SAAF indicated  the  lifespan  of
              the Cheetah fighters to be up to around 2012. What will be the
              position of the Cheetah in the light of the acquisition of the
              Gripens?


         H. Implications for SAAF's operational budget
              The Chief of the SAAF allowed the amount of R176 million to be
              deducted from the budget  of  the  SAAF,  notwithstanding  his
              awareness of the 30% shortfall with regard to the readiness of
              the Air Force. We will need to be briefed on this  aspect,  in
              particular with regard to the impact on the  total  budget  of
              the SANDF.


         I. Structures


              We note with concern a plethora of structures  and  committees
              involved in the acquisition process. We refer, inter alia,  to
              PCB, SOFCOM,  JPT,  IONT,  AAB,  AACB,  Technical  Team,  etc.
              Furthermore, we observe the following  with  regard  to  these
              structures:


              1.  Individuals occupying a number of positions, thus blurring
                  the lines of accountability and authority.


              2.  A lack of race and/or gender balance.


              3.  People are given incompatible functions to perform.


         J. Conflict of interest


              The issue relating to Conflict of Interest needs to  be  dealt
              with resolutely and decisively within the  public  service  in
              general and by both the DoD and Armscor  in  particular.  This
              will  require  institution  and/or  amendment  of  appropriate
              legislation to govern and control the  activities  of  serving
              public servants. Persons named in the Report  as  having  been
              involved  in  a  Conflict  of  Interest  and/or   engaged   in
              activities deemed unprofessional from the perspective  of  the
              procurement process, should be debarred from  service  in  any
              civil service or parastatal.
              The Chief of Acquisition occupied a position of Chief Director
              within the DoD. Given the fundamentally  political  nature  of
              procurement, it is felt that a person at that level should not
              have been given such incompatible function  to  perform.  This
              also  applies  to  other  officials  from,  for  example,  the
              Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). It  is  felt  that  in
              future  a  person  with  more  political   and   institutional
              seniority should manage such processes.


              Real and apparent conflict  of  interest  did  emerge  between
              various senior officials of  the  DoD,  Armscor  and  the  DTI
              (particularly  those  directly  involved  in  the  acquisition
              packages) and members of the bidding  teams  for  the  various
              equipment within the Strategic Defence Packages (SDP).


              The determination of responsibilities within  the  acquisition
              process needs to be rationalised and streamlined. It  came  to
              the attention of the parliamentary committees on defence  that
              senior DoD and Armscor officials frequently "wore a number  of
              hats", thereby limiting their ability to act  impartially  and
              to avoid a real or perceived  conflict  of  interest.  In  our
              opinion, this  impeded  good  governance.  This  is  not  only
              limited to the DoD and  Armscor,  but  includes  officials  of
              other state departments.


              An investigation needs to be conducted by the DoD and  Armscor
              of those individuals whose professional behaviour was  queried
              in the Report.


         K. Conclusion


              Implementation framework


              To ensure that the mentioned and  future  recommendations  are
              applied  in  a  consistent  and  rational  manner,  the  Joint
              Standing Committee on Defence will compile  an  implementation
              framework  that  will  specify,  amongst  other  things,   the
              following:


              1.  The co-ordinating responsibility for the implementation of
                  the diverse recommendations contained in this Report.


              2.   The  Executing  Authority/Authorities   responsible   for
                  implementing  those  recommendations,  which   have   been
                  assigned to them within the context of this Report.


              3.  The ongoing oversight/monitoring of these responsibilities
                  and their execution and the  authorities  responsible  for
                  this monitoring role.

2.    Report of the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests on  the
     Joint Investigation  Report  into  the  Strategic  Defence  Procurement
     Packages, dated 6 December 2001:


         On 14 November 2001 the Speaker of the National  Assembly  referred
         the  Joint  Investigation  Report  into   the   Strategic   Defence
         Procurement Packages, in  so  far  as  it  relates  to  Members  of
         Parliament,  to  the  Joint  Committee  on  Ethics   and   Members'
         Interests for consideration.


         The Committee met on the 16  November  2001  and  agreed  that  the
         Report only makes two references to Members, namely:


         (1)     The allegation that Mr Mashimbye and Mr M Scott received  a
              motor vehicle from prime contractors/bidders was found  to  be
              without substance.


         (2)     Secondly, Chapter 1.3.1.2(4) in the  table  states  that  a
              criminal case is pending against  Mr  Yengeni.  The  Committee
              received opinion from the Chief Parliamentary Law Adviser that
              in terms of the sub judice rule it would be  prudent  for  the
              Committee to wait for the  conclusion  of  the  criminal  case
              before the Committee considers  the  allegation  of  the  non-
              disclosure of the benefit by Mr Yengeni.  The  Committee  will
              therefore pursue  the  matter  after  the  conclusion  of  the
              criminal case against Mr Yengeni.


         (3)     The Report makes reference to the lack  of  rules  to  deal
              with conflict of interests. In so far as Members of Parliament
              are concerned the Committee is considering a Code of  Conduct,
              of which the draft proposals specifically deal  with  conflict
              of interests and  post  tenure  employment  restrictions.  The
              Committee aims to complete the draft code in the first quarter
              of next year.
         (4)     The Committee had received a complaint against Mr Msomi  in
              respect of the alleged receipt of discounts on motor  vehicles
              from a bidder/contractor, the Investigating  Report  makes  no
              reference  to  the  allegations  against  Mr  Msomi,  and  the
              Committee  therefore  agreed  that  it   will   consider   the
              allegations against him through the normal procedures  of  the
              Committee.


         Report to be considered.

National Assembly:

1.     Report  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Defence   on   the   Joint
     Investigation Report into the Strategic Defence  Procurement  Packages,
     dated 5 December 2001:


         The Portfolio Committee on Defence, having considered  the  matters
         in the Report falling within the parameters of  its  portfolio,  in
         particular Chapters 3-7 and 10-12, and  having  to  report  on  the
         relevant findings and recommendations by 6 December 2001  (ATC,  14
         November 2001, No 152, p 1390), reports as follows:


         A. Introduction


              On 15 November 2001, the Joint Investigative  Team  (hereafter
              the Agencies),  which  investigated  certain  aspects  of  the
              Strategic  Defence   Packages,   presented   its   report   to
              Parliament. Although aspects of the  investigation  are  still
              under way, the Agencies managed to complete most of the  tasks
              within its mandate. We note the findings  of  the  Report  and
              congratulate the Agencies for  their  work  in  compiling  the
              Report.


              This  Report  of  the  Committee  strives  to  make   concrete
              suggestions regarding the following:


              1.  Identifying the key strategic issues raised in the Report,
                  which require consideration by both the executive and  the
                  parliamentary committees on defence.


              2.  Making various  process  recommendations  as  to  how  the
                  findings of the Report can be taken forward.


         B. Role of Parliament


              According to the Defence Review (chapter on Acquisition),  the
              Committee has a key role  in  monitoring  and  overseeing  the
              Ministry of Defence, Armscor and  the  Department  of  Defence
              (DoD)  on  any  acquisition  process.  This  role  should   be
              strengthened through the institution of  appropriate  Standard
              Operating  Procedures  between  the   relevant   parliamentary
              committees  on  defence  and  the   Ministry   regarding   the
              management of any acquisition process.


              The rationale for involving the  parliamentary  committees  on
              defence in these decisions is as follows:


              1.  All major procurement programmes are capital-intensive  by
                  nature  and,  as  such,  require   substantial   financial
                  outlays from the fiscus. Parliament approves  the  defence
                  budget and therefore has an interest in ensuring that  any
                  financial outlays are managed according to the budget.


              2.  The mandate of the parliamentary committees on defence  is
                  to provide oversight over the  key  policy  processes  and
                  developments within both Armscor and the DoD, and as  such
                  any  acquisition  project  represents   a   major   policy
                  position for both Armscor and the DoD.


              3.   All  major  procurement  programmes   are   fundamentally
                  strategic  by  nature,  and  as  such  the   parliamentary
                  committees on defence have  a  responsibility  to  oversee
                  both Armscor and the DoD on the strategic implications  of
                  such packages.


              4.  Sub-optimal equipment will not  only  affect  the  SANDF's
                  combat-readiness, but also  the  lives  of  those  persons
                  operating such equipment. Parliament and  its  committees,
                  as  the  political  custodians  of  the  national  defence
                  function, have a moral and a political  responsibility  to
                  ensure that all acquisition  purchases  conform  to  basic
                  operational and security standards.
                  The parliamentary committees on  defence  should  play  an
                  important role in advising the Ministry, Armscor  and  the
                  DoD on the strategic aspects  of  such  packages  and  the
                  political  sensitivity  of  any  proposed  purchases.   To
                  perform these tasks adequately, it is  critical  that  the
                  parliamentary committees  on  defence  in  particular  and
                  other related parliamentary committees in  general  should
                  develop the necessary capacity and planning schedules  and
                  receive  the  necessary  resources  to  acquit  themselves
                  capably.


         C. Security clearance


              The status of security clearances within both Armscor and  the
              DoD needs to be investigated as a matter of  urgency.  Updates
              of existing security clearances and  vetting  of  non-security
              cleared personnel need to be effected as a matter of priority.


              In cases where there  was  a  breach  of  security  directives
              and/or  legislation  in  the  defence   procurement   process,
              necessary steps needs to be taken.


         D. Record-keeping


              Control over internal Armscor and DoD documentation and record-
              keeping  needs  to  be  improved  in  accordance  with   those
              procedures governing the control of classified information  as
              set out by the counter-intelligence function of  the  DoD.  An
              audit trail of all processes linked to  procurement  processes
              needs to be maintained and managed at all times.


         E. Acquisition policy


              Current Armscor and DoD procurement policy compares favourably
              with previous procurement policies that pertained within  both
              Armscor and the DoD in the past. Aspects  of  the  procurement
              policy do need to be fine-tuned,  and  personnel  within  both
              Armscor and the DoD  need  to  be  made  conversant  with  the
              content and the importance of this policy. This  will  require
              the institution of appropriate training and workshops, as well
              as Standard Operating Procedures within Armscor and  the  DoD,
              to ensure that this is accomplished.


              Each phase of the  procurement  process  should  be  concluded
              according to policy prescripts before proceeding to  the  next
              phase. Furthermore, proper authorisation should be obtained at
              each  phase  before  continuing.  Such  authorisations  should
              determine whether the next phase is embarked upon.
              Considerations such as the strategic  objectives  of  the  DoD
              that impact on the procurement process, should be weighted and
              form part of  the  value  system.  It  must  then  be  applied
              consistently throughout the process.


              Future defence procurement  packages  need  to  be  critically
              assessed against the needs of the current strategic and global
              environment.


              The Defence Review states that procurement should, as  far  as
              possible, attempt  to  make  use  of  local  defence  industry
              capabilities.  The   Report   notes   that   foreign   defence
              capabilities were privileged over domestic  capabilities.  The
              parliamentary committees believe that this situation needs  to
              be  avoided  if  local  defence  capabilities,  an  undisputed
              national strategic asset, are to be maintained.


         F. Armscor Act


              A Work Group that had to deal with the drafting of the Armscor
              Act, was established by the Ministry  of  Defence  in  January
              2000. We are concerned that there was not sufficient  feedback
              to Parliament. This should be  attended  to  as  a  matter  of
              urgency, given certain observations by the Agencies.


              The role of Armscor and the DoD with regard to  subcontracting
              needs to be clarified. We understand in the Report that it  is
              not the policy of  Armscor  and  the  DoD  to  interfere  with
              subcontractors, yet numerous  instances  of  interference  are
              mentioned. Whilst Armscor has  the  right  to  interfere  with
              subcontracting,  it  must  do  so  within  the  framework   of
              government policies vis-á-vis affirmative  procurement,  black
              empowerment and technical and strategic needs.
              Armscor as the procurement agency of the DoD, as  mandated  by
              law, should resume this responsibility when the  DoD  procures
              defence equipment.


         G. Cheetah fighters


              The Report observes that the SAAF indicated  the  lifespan  of
              the Cheetah fighters to be up to around 2012. What will be the
              position of the Cheetah in the light of the acquisition of the
              Gripens?


         H. Implications for SAAF's operational budget


              The Chief of the SAAF allowed the amount of R176 million to be
              deducted from the budget  of  the  SAAF,  notwithstanding  his
              awareness of the 30% shortfall with regard to the readiness of
              the Air Force. We will need to be briefed on this  aspect,  in
              particular with regard to the impact on the  total  budget  of
              the SANDF.


         I. Structures


              We note with concern a plethora of structures  and  committees
              involved in the acquisition process. We refer, inter alia,  to
              PCB, SOFCOM,  JPT,  IONT,  AAB,  AACB,  Technical  Team,  etc.
              Furthermore, we observe the following  with  regard  to  these
              structures:


              1.  Individuals occupying a number of positions, thus blurring
                  the lines of accountability and authority.


              2.  A lack of race and/or gender balance.


              3.  People are given incompatible functions to perform.


         J. Conflict of interest
              The issue relating to Conflict of Interest needs to  be  dealt
              with resolutely and decisively within the  public  service  in
              general and by both the DoD and Armscor  in  particular.  This
              will  require  institution  and/or  amendment  of  appropriate
              legislation to govern and control the  activities  of  serving
              public servants. Persons named in the Report  as  having  been
              involved  in  a  Conflict  of  Interest  and/or   engaged   in
              activities deemed unprofessional from the perspective  of  the
              procurement process, should be debarred from  service  in  any
              civil service or parastatal.


              The Chief of Acquisition occupied a position of Chief Director
              within the DoD. Given the fundamentally  political  nature  of
              procurement, it is felt that a person at that level should not
              have been given such incompatible function  to  perform.  This
              also  applies  to  other  officials  from,  for  example,  the
              Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). It  is  felt  that  in
              future  a  person  with  more  political   and   institutional
              seniority should manage such processes.


              Real and apparent conflict  of  interest  did  emerge  between
              various senior officials of  the  DoD,  Armscor  and  the  DTI
              (particularly  those  directly  involved  in  the  acquisition
              packages) and members of the bidding  teams  for  the  various
              equipment within the Strategic Defence Packages (SDP).


              The determination of responsibilities within  the  acquisition
              process needs to be rationalised and streamlined. It  came  to
              the attention of the parliamentary committees on defence  that
              senior DoD and Armscor officials frequently "wore a number  of
              hats", thereby limiting their ability to act  impartially  and
              to avoid a real or perceived  conflict  of  interest.  In  our
              opinion, this  impeded  good  governance.  This  is  not  only
              limited to the DoD and  Armscor,  but  includes  officials  of
              other state departments.


              An investigation needs to be conducted by the DoD and  Armscor
              of those individuals whose professional behaviour was  queried
              in the Report.


         K. Conclusion


              Implementation framework


              To ensure that the mentioned and  future  recommendations  are
              applied in a consistent and  rational  manner,  the  Portfolio
              Committee on Defence will compile an implementation  framework
              that will specify, amongst other things, the following:


              1.  The co-ordinating responsibility for the implementation of
                  the diverse recommendations contained in this Report.


              2.   The  Executing  Authority/Authorities   responsible   for
                  implementing  those  recommendations,  which   have   been
                  assigned to them within the context of this Report.


              3.  The ongoing oversight/monitoring of these responsibilities
                  and their execution and the  authorities  responsible  for
                  this monitoring role.


     Report to be considered.

2.     Report  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Finance   on   the   Joint
     Investigation Report into the Strategic Defence  Procurement  Packages,
     dated 6 December 2001:


         On 18 November 1998 the Cabinet approved an  amount  of  R29 773,13
         million for the acquisition of  armaments  for  the  South  African
         National Defence Force. The finding of  the  Special  Investigation
         is that 49% of the financing costs of this  purchase  was  excluded
         from this amount. (Finding 1, p 263 - Financing  Costs  is  defined
         as the "value  of  the  total  financing  costs  payable  over  the
         financing period, i.e. interest,  management  fees,  export  credit
         fees, etc, expressed in million US$" (Annexure A Point 10)).


         The Report also states that the "figures did not include  a  number
         of items such  as  freight  insurance,  taxes,  project  management
         costs, financing costs and loan premiums" (par 9.1.2.1).


         The Cabinet mandated the Departments of Defence (DoD), of  Finance,
         of Public Enterprises and of Trade (DTI)  and  Industry  to  engage
         with detailed negotiations with the  preferred  bidders  so  as  to
         achieve   affordable   agreements.   The    International    Offers
         Negotiating Team (IONT) was set up to do  the  negotiations,  which
         would  result  in  a  final  contract  for  the  offered  equipment
         (Chapter 8).


         On 31 August 1999, the Affordability Report compiled  by  the  IONT
         stated that the total cost of the package, at an estimated  forward
         exchange rate, was R36 482 million, "consequently  the  total  full
         cost is substantially higher  than  that  originally  presented  to
         Cabinet" (par 9.2.3.6 (b)). One of the most  significant  increases
         was the rise in the purchase of  the  LIFT  &  ALFA  from  R15  603
         million to R19 620 million (par 4.6.15, p 103).


         The new total figure  included  all  procurement  costs,  viz.  the
         contract price (the actual  military  equipment),  statutory  costs
         (freight insurance and taxes incurred by the Department of  Defence
         and Armscor in managing  the  procurements),  financing  costs  for
         deferring payments to suppliers, ECA premiums payable on  all  ECA-
         backed loans, and escalation of all of the preceding  amounts.  The
         amount was calculated on an estimated  forward  exchange  rate  and
         excluded financing costs (par 4.6.15).


         On 25 November 1999, the Cabinet approved  an  amount  of  R30  285
         million for the  entire  package,  exclusive  of  financing  costs.
         These expenditures will be carried via transfers to  the  Strategic
         Defence Account of the Department of Defence.  The  contracts  were
         signed on 3 December 1999.  Certain  cost-containing  changes  were
         made that  differed  from  the  original  Cabinet  decision  of  25
         November 1998. These changes were necessitated  by  the  escalation
         of the costs identified by the Affordability Report, due partly  to
         the omission of certain costs at the initial  presentation  to  the
         Cabinet. Some of the significant changes included the following:
         1. The number of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) to  be  purchased,
              was decreased from 40 to 30 (par 8.11.3.2). This resulted in a
              decrease in total costs from R2 446 million to R1 965  million
              (par 8.11.3.7).


         2. The implementation costs of R176,3 million for the LUH will  now
              have to be incorporated into the SAAF budget, as  this  amount
              was not included in the presentation  to  the  Cabinet  on  15
              September 1999 (par 8.11.3.6).


         3. The  omission  of  the  purchase  of  Maritime  Helicopters  was
              estimated by the Affordability Team to amount to R967 million.
              It appears, from an answer given by the Minister of Defence in
              Parliament, that the SANDF will purchase these helicopters and
              that delivery will  be  at  the  same  time  as  that  of  the
              Corvettes (evidence given at  parliamentary  hearings  of  the
              Joint Investigating Team (JIT) (4/12/2001)). It  would  appear
              that the cost would have to be carried by the  budget  of  the
              SANDF outside of the amount agreed  by  the  Cabinet  that  is
              attributable to the Special Defence Account. It  is  uncertain
              where the costs of such a transaction would be incurred in the
              budget.


         4. The purchase of  the  LIFT  &  ALFA  was  separated  into  three
              phases, called Tranches, with the option to cancel Tranches  2
              and 3 at a later date. This decision was made because  of  the
              unpredictability of foreign exchange rates and economic growth
              over a 10- to 15-year period (par 8.8.3.2). The government  is
              committed to an amount of R15 916 million for the total LIFT &
              ALFA package, with Tranche 1 amounting to approximately R7 830
              million. The total cost of  the  entire  arms  acquisition  of
              Tranche 1 stands at R22 199 million. The Chief of the SAAF has
              stated that there is a risk involved in reducing the number of
              aircraft that would be available to train pilots. Furthermore,
              because  the  dual-seater  Gripen  does  not  have  the   full
              operational capacity of the single-seater, it  does  not  have
              the same deterrent value, and  without  the  purchase  of  the
              second and third Tranches, the operational fighter  capability
              of  the  SANDF  will  be  severely  limited  after  2010  (par
              4.7.8.6).


         5. Some of the essential functionalities of  the  aircraft  in  the
              LIFT & ALFA packages had been removed during  the  negotiation
              phase, and their cost will have to be accommodated outside the
              Cabinet-approved package (par  8.11.2.4  and  par  4.7.9),  as
              these  costs  were  not  submitted  to  the  Cabinet  (Finding
              4.12.7). The Chief of the SAAF has indicated that "the LIFT  &
              ALFA aircraft is a  system  in  terms  of  the  total  systems
              management approach. This means that any  scenario  that  does
              not include all  the  components  of  the  system,  cannot  be
              supported" (par 4.7.8.6). The JIT estimates that the inclusion
              of these functionalities would amount to R1 169 million. It is
              uncertain   whether   these   functionalities   are   to    be
              reincorporated or not. The  costs  will  have  to  be  carried
              outside of the Strategic Defence Account.


         6. The leasing of the simulator equipment for the Hawk  and  Gripen
              had been transferred from Tranches 2 and 3 to a full  purchase
              agreement in Tranche 1. The costs of the Hawk  and  Gripen  in
              Tranche 1 are therefore respectively 35% and 34%  higher  than
              the average cost. This would represent  an  implicit  cost  of
              about R1 736 million, should government exercise its option to
              cancel (par 4.7.8.4).


         Due to these cost-cutting measures, the JIT found  that  they  were
         unable to make a conclusive finding on  the  total  impact  of  the
         IONT on the value of the total costs. Finding 8.12.4. reads:


              "However, it is not possible to make a conclusive  finding  on
              the total impact of IONT, because:


              *   Some functionalities of the packages were removed.
              *   The quantity  of  equipment  for  the  LUH  programme  was
                  reduced.
              *   Certain costs, for example management and statutory costs,
                  had not been included in the presentation to Cabinet".


         In view of the fact that certain cost-containing  measures  had  to
         be introduced once the Affordability  Report  found  that  not  all
         costs had been submitted to the Cabinet in November 1998, and  that
         some of these costs might have to be funded outside of the  package
         finally approved by the Cabinet in 1999, the JIT has made  two  key
         recommendations which are fully endorsed by the Committee:


              Par 4.13.5:


                  "Detailed  and   accurate   information,   including   all
                  possible  costs,  should  be  submitted  to  Cabinet.  All
                  currency   risk   implications   regarding   international
                  armaments acquisitions should  be  disclosed  to  Cabinet.
                  Such information is necessary  to  ensure  that  essential
                  functionalities  are  not  removed  from  aircraft  during
                  negotiations due to budget constraints".


              Par 8.13.4:
                  "Proper consultation and an impact study  should  be  done
                  before equipment types or functionalities are reduced".


         The Committee further recommends that amendments be  introduced  to
         the Public Financial Management Act that will ensure that not  only
         the cost implications of legislation  brought  before  the  Cabinet
         and Parliament be fully spelt out, but that  the  affordability  of
         all major purchases by  the  government,  including  all  financing
         costs and potential risks,  be  made  known  prior  to  any  formal
         decisions being taken. The role of Parliament in  this  case  needs
         to be clearly specified.


         Furthermore, the Committee recommends  that  affordability  reports
         are finalised prior to the finalisation of purchase negotiations.


         The  Committee  also  wishes  to  endorse  the  following   further
         recommendations of the JIT:


              Par 8.13.1:


                  "It should be prescribed that all  procurement  processes,
                  including  negotiations  with   preferred   bidders,   are
                  properly documented to ensure a proper audit trail".


              Par 8.13.2:


                  "DoD should take steps to  ensure  that  good  procurement
                  practices are adhered to  and  that  compliance  with  the
                  prescribed tender procedures is strictly controlled".


         In addition, the Committee also endorses the recommendation of  the
         JIT in par 3.4, which states, inter alia, that "the  staff  of  DoD
         and Armscor involved in procurement should be properly  trained  to
         ensure that they assimilate and fully understand the policy with  a
         view to its effective implementation".


              Par 8.13.3:


                  "An approved negotiation strategy and terms  of  reference
                  should  be  in  place  prior  to   the   commencement   of
                  negotiations".


         The  Committee  is  aware  that  the  government  is  preparing  to
         overhaul  its  entire  procurement  policies  and  practices,   and
         recommends  that  the  shortcomings   of   this   particular   arms
         procurement process be fully identified and analysed  with  a  view
         to rectifying them in the reforms that are to be adopted.


         The Committee takes note that  the  government  has  an  option  to
         cancel  Tranches  2  and  3,  should  it  so  wish.  The  Committee
         recommends that the Cabinet continue to review the  advantages  and
         disadvantages of exercising these options on a  regular  basis.  In
         this regard,  the  Committee  notes  with  increasing  concern  the
         rapidly increasing exchange rate risk posed by the recent  dramatic
         decline in the value of the Rand. It is common knowledge that  this
         was entirely unanticipated by all analysts and could not have  been
         taken into account at the time of the signing of the contracts.  It
         is,  however,  a  serious  factor   that   must   be   taken   into
         consideration.   Furthermore,   it   is   regrettable   that    the
         Affordability Model that was drawn up,  did  not  take  opportunity
         costs into consideration (p 263, par J). It is recommended that  in
         future all affordability models should include such a component.


         From a macro-economic point of view, the Committee  takes  note  of
         the statements made by the  Director-General  of  Finance,  to  the
         effect that although the  loans  are  mainly  in  foreign  currency
         denominations, the total foreign debt exposure of South  Africa  is
         still very low and does not exceed 10%  of  total  debt.  There  is
         therefore  hardly  any  risk  of  severe  foreign  debt   exposure.
         Secondly, the projected fiscal deficit of 2,6% is  still  scheduled
         to remain on track at that same level.


         The Committee notes that there are a number of provisions  for  the
         regular update of the revised figures of  the  costs  of  the  arms
         procurement. These will  be  made  available  each  year  with  the
         tabling of  the  Budget  in  February  and  with  the  monthly  and
         quarterly  revenue  and  expenditure  reports  that  the   National
         Treasury  issues.  The  Committee  recommends   that   a   standard

         (1)      On  25/11,  Cabinet  approved   a   staggered   (tranched)

              was agreed to purchase 24 Hawk and 28 Gripen as one package.


         (2)     Increase in cost from 18/11 presumed to be the omission  of
              certain cost elements - p 239.


         (3)     Increase in cost from 18/11 presumed to be due to  omission
              of certain cost elements - p 239.


         (4)     Increase in cost from 18/11 presumed  due  to  omission  of
              certain cost elements - p 239.


         (5)     Increase in cost from 18/11  due  to  omission  of  certain
              cost elements - p 243. Decrease in cost from 31/08 unknown.


         (6)     Decrease in cost from 31/08 unknown.
         (7)     Decrease in cost from 31/08 due to  reduction  in  purchase
              of LUH from 40 to 30 - p 242, par 8.11.3.7. The implementation
              cost  of  R176,3  million  not  included  in  programme   cost
              presented on 15/09. Cost must be incorporated into SAAF budget
              - p 243, par 8.11.3.6.


         (8)     Increased costs from 15/11 due to increased financing  cash
              flows, statutory and project  management  costs  and  the  ECA
              premium (p 244). The actual  contract  price  same  as  tender
              price for both dates, viz. R4 226 million


         (9)     Decrease in price from 15/09 due  to  negotiated  reduction
              in tender price from R5 469 million to R5 412 million - p 240.


         (10)    Increase in price from 15/09 due to increase  in  statutory
              cost and project management, financing preferred cash flow and
              ECA premium. Contract price is R1 249 million - p 243.
         (11)    Decrease in cost from 31/08 (see footnote 15).


         (12)    Increase in cost from 15/09 mainly due to the  transfer  of
              the leasing of the simulator equipment for the Hawk and Gripen
              from Tranche 2 and 3 to a full purchase agreement in Tranche 1
              - p 258 & p 106.


         (13)    Difference with 18/11  due  to  omission  of  certain  cost
              elements such as statutory and project management  costs,  ECA
              premiums and financing costs, amounting to R4 017 million more
              than was approved - p 103.


         (14)    The leasing of the simulator equipment  for  the  Hawk  and
              Gripen has been transferred from Tranche  2  &  3  to  a  full
              purchase agreement in Tranche 1. The costs for  the  Hawk  and
              Gripen in Tranche 1 are 35% and 34% higher  than  the  average
              cost - par 4.7.8.4.
         (15)    The increase from 15/09 is due to increased  statutory  and
              project management costs and training equipment. The  contract
              price is R13 359 million. The  difference  with  31/08  (large
              decrease) is due to  the  fact  that  some  of  the  essential
              functionalities of the aircraft in the LIFT and ALFA  packages
              have  been  excluded,  thereby  causing  a  reduction  of  the
              programme cost. The cost of these items will  have  to  funded
              outside the Strategic Defence Programme - par 4.7.9, p 107.


         (16)    The  final  cost  at  contract  price  amounted  to  R30,05
              billion was somewhat lower than the  total  cost  approved  by
              Cabinet on 5 November 1999. This was due to a reduction in the
              negotiated  contract  prices  of  the  trainer   and   fighter
              aircraft. The 2001 Budget estimates of  the  total  cash  flow
              expenditure on the strategic defence procurements excluded the
              export credit premiums, which are part of the financing costs,
              of which the total expenditure would be R43,0 billion.


     Report to be considered.

3.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on  the  Joint
     Investigation Report into the Strategic Defence  Procurement  Packages,
     dated 5 December 2001:


     In accordance with the directive  of  the  Speaker,  published  in  the
     Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports of 14 November 2001,  the
     Portfolio Committee on Trade and  Industry  met  to  consider  "matters
     falling within its portfolio, and in  particular  Chapter  12"  of  the
     report, and reports as follows:


         The Committee met with Mr Bahle  Sibisi,  Deputy  Director-General,
         and  Mr  Lionel  October,  Chief   Director   in   the   Industrial
         Participation division of the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry
         (DTI), on 21 November and 4  December.  Members  of  the  Committee
         also had an opportunity to clarify certain matters with members  of
         the Joint Investigating Team at a  joint  committee  meeting  on  4
         December 2001.


         The  DTI  team  gave  the   Committee   their   response   to   the
         recommendation in par 12.4, p 370, of the  report.  They  indicated
         that the Minister of Trade and Industry  had  already  stated  that
         this recommendation would be implemented. They also indicated  that
         steps were being taken to  upgrade  administrative  and  monitoring
         capacities in the Industrial Participation Secretariat and to  deal
         with a number of procedural  shortcomings  highlighted  in  various
         chapters of the report. These include the appointment of  dedicated
         portfolio managers to manage and  monitor  each  of  the  companies
         that have large obligations; biannual review meetings  and  monthly
         assessment  meetings;  improved  procedures  for  the  approval  of
         projects and awarding of credits; and improved  administrative  and
         record-keeping systems.


         The DTI indicated that the Industrial Participation (IP)  contracts
         came into effect in April/May 2000, and  that  the  third  biannual
         review is in the process of being completed. While the DTI was  not
         in a position to provide a full report  at  this  stage,  they  did
         provide  the  Committee  with  a  preliminary   overview   of   the
         performance  of  the  National   Industrial   Participation   (NIP)
         projects that  fall  under  the  DTI.  The  total  NIP  obligations
         arising from the  Strategic  Defence  Procurement  Packages  (SDPP)
         (value of investment in projects and export earnings  generated  by
         them) amount to US$ 13 410,69 million. The first  "milestones"  are
         due in 2003 and 2004, by which time obligors are required  to  meet
         investment and export targets of US$ 3,998 million.  The  Committee
         was told that projects to the value of US$ 5,008 million  have,  in
         fact, already been  approved  and  are  active,  meaning  that  the
         implementation of the NIPs "exceeds the contractual milestone by  a
         safe margin". The DTI undertook to table a fuller  progress  report
         for the Committee early next year.


         The Committee is strongly of the view that  the  implementation  of
         both the NIPS and DIPS is of major importance to  the  country  and
         an integral part of the "value for money" of the Strategic  Defence
         Procurement Packages.


         The Committee accepts the "Findings" in section 12.3, and notes  in
         particular the concern expressed in par 12.3.8.


         The Committee also notes the report by  the  DTI,  indicating  that
         certain measures are in place to  improve  procedures  and  conduct
         regular performance reviews. The Committee further notes the  DTI's
         view that the implementation of IP projects to date is  broadly  on
         track and exceeds contractual milestones, and  that  there  are  no
         indications at present  that  any  of  the  prime  contractors  are
         preparing to take advantage of the  "opt  out"  provisions  of  the
         contracts.


         The Committee endorses the following recommendations:


         1. Par 4.13.6: Proper evaluation of IP offers should take place  at
              the RFO stage of a procurement process in order to ensure that
              only feasible projects are  selected  and  that  the  need  to
              negotiate with bidders to replace projects at a later stage is
              consequently minimised. At the  same  time,  it  needs  to  be
              recognised that market conditions can change in ways that make
              some adaptation unavoidable or desirable. A  delicate  balance
              needs to be struck between the need for clarity and  certainty
              as a basis for monitoring  implementation  and  the  need  for
              flexibility to  allow  adjustment  as  new  market  conditions
              arise.


         2.  Par  12.2.9.5(e):  Credits  towards   the   discharge   of   IP
              obligations based on signed  contracts  with  local  suppliers
              rather than the presentation of invoices could be open to  the
              abuse indicated in the report. The DTI team told us  that  the
              latter was already established practice.


         3. Par 12.4: In the interaction with the Joint  Investigating  Team
              on 4 December, it became clear that a major  concern  in  this
              regard was the sharp drop in the value of the  penalty  charge
              that would arise from non-completion, as  distinct  from  non-
              implementation of an obligation (a reduction from 10% to 5% of
              the contract  price).  The  Committee  hopes  that  the  legal
              opinion will contribute  to  identifying  ways  in  which  the
              closure of this and other possible loopholes can contribute to
              ensure  compliance  with,  rather  than  opting  out  of,   IP
              obligations.


         At  the   same   time,   we   believe   that   ensuring   effective
         implementation of IP projects (both those related to  the  SDP  and
         those arising from other procurements) is a function of  much  more
         than tight controls in contracts.  It  depends  also,  and  perhaps
         even more critically, on follow-up actions by the  government,  and
         the  DTI  in  particular,  interacting  with  the  contractors  and
         creating the conditions for IP projects to go ahead. This  includes
         working  together  with  contractors  to  identify  locations   for
         projects,  generate  infrastructure  services  and  provide   other
         services on a similar basis as those provided to  other  investors.
         All of this relates to broader  issues  of  investment  policy  and
         industrial strategy.


         It is,  moreover,  of  critical  importance  that  the  lessons  of
         administrative and procedural shortcomings in  respect  of  the  IP
         projects arising from the SDP are translated  into  more  effective
         processes  of  negotiating  IP  projects  in  respect   of   future
         procurements. The fact that the DTI has  identified  the  need  for
         improvements and implemented some reforms, is to be welcomed.


         All of the above are matters that  fall  well  within  the  overall
         oversight responsibilities of the Committee. We  note  and  welcome
         the DTI's commitment to providing us with  a  fuller  report  early
         next year. This, the Committee has indicated to the DTI,  needs  to
         be broken down project by project, with the benefits to be  derived
         from each  project  also  disaggregated  into  clear  categories  -
         investment, export earnings, direct  and  indirect  jobs.  We  need
         also to receive timely and  regular  reports  from  the  Industrial
         Participation  Secretariat  on  IP  projects  arising  from   other
         procurements.


         The Committee, finally, welcomes the  indication  by  the  Auditor-
         General that monitoring of implementation of IP projects will  form
         part of the regular audits of the DTI, carried out by his Office.


     Report to be considered.

4.     Report  of  the   Portfolio   Committee   on   Public   Service   and
     Administration on the Joint Investigation  Report  into  the  Strategic
     Defence Procurement Packages, dated 6 December 2001:


     A.     Introduction


         The report being considered relates to the investigation  into  the
         Strategic Defence packages for the  acquisition  of  armaments  for
         the South African  National  Defence  Force,  which  was  conducted
         jointly by the  Offices  of  the  Public  Protector,  the  Auditor-
         General and the National Director of Public Prosecutions.


         The investigation came  about  after  it  was  established  by  the
         Auditor-General,  during  November  1998,  that   the   procurement
         process  was  a   high-risk   area   that   warranted   a   review.
         Subsequently,  a  special  review  by   the   Auditor-General   was
         conducted and signed on 15 September 2000, which  recommended  that
         certain areas of the  procurement  process  needed  attention.  The
         matter was handled by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts  of
         the National Assembly, which recommended that a multi-agency  probe
         into the matter be conducted, hence Parliament's approval for  such
         an investigation on 2 November 2000.


         The three agencies conducted  the  investigation,  and  focused  on
         cost to State, the selection of prime  contractors,  the  selection
         of subcontractors and  the  contracts  themselves.  After  thorough
         investigation of  these  issues,  the  agencies  established  that,
         despite certain anomalies and  technical  inadequacies  at  various
         stages of  the  procurement  process,  there  was  no  evidence  of
         improper  or  unlawful  conduct  by  the  government.   They   made
         recommendations on areas in respect of which  particular  attention
         needed to be drawn by the Executive or the  Prosecuting  Authority,
         with a view to taking action.


         Upon receipt of this report from  the  three  agencies,  Parliament
         instructed eight Committees to interact  with  the  aforementioned,
         and the Portfolio Committee on Public  Service  and  Administration
         was accordingly charged to deal  with  issues  falling  within  its
         scope, particularly Chapter 10.


     B.     Background


         1. Chapter 10 deals with anomalies  related  to  the  selection  of
              subcontractors in the procurement  process,  and  particularly
              the fact that the reports indicates  that  there  has  been  a
              conflict of interest in the selection process,  and  that  the
              process was not managed according to stipulated processes.


         2. The facts in this regard are that -


              (a) the Chief of Acquisitions had a conflict  of  interest  in
                  the process, arising from the fact that he had  a  brother
                  who had an  interest  in  subcontractors  that  were  also
                  bidding for the contracts. He declared  that  conflict  of
                  interest, and yet did not recuse himself  from  activities
                  of  the  PCB  meetings,  which  were  to  decide  on   the
                  allocation of such contracts.


              (b) The main contractors did not follow a formal  process  for
                  the selection of subcontractors in all instances, as  they
                  only embarked on teaming arrangements and  joint  ventures
                  with the local defence industry.


              (c) Despite the fact that it is a requirement of  the  Defence
                  Review and the Department of Defence's Procurement  Policy
                  that role-players  should  have  security  clearance,  the
                  Chief  of  Acquisitions   did   not   accordingly   secure
                  clearance.


              It should be noted that the agencies found the facts mentioned
              above to be a serious violation of the expected  conducted  of
              people charged with responsibilities of public duty, and  that
              they  (the  agencies)  declared  the  Chief  of  Acquisitions'
              declaration of interest to be null and void.
              As we deal with this report, we should not lose sight  of  the
              fact that there are policies we may employ to address some  of
              the negative tendencies highlighted above. The Public  Service
              Act and the Public Financial Management Act  (PFMA)  are,  for
              instance, useful tools to deal with questions of  conflict  of
              interest, financial management and procurement.


     C.     Recommendations


         1. The Committee supports the recommendations of the agencies,  and
              believes that, as  they  are  implemented,  existing  policies
              should  be  taken  into  account  so  as  to  avoid   possible
              duplication.


         2. In strengthening this position, we request  the  Public  Service
              Commission  to  closely  monitor   the   process   of   policy
              implementation on an ongoing basis, and report thereon to  the
              Committee.


         3. We call on the Department of Defence and the Department  of  the
              Public Service and Administration to work  closely  with  each
              other in  addressing,  in  particular,  the  urgent  personnel
              audit, in order to  ensure  that  all  staff  members  of  the
              Department of Defence  comply  with  the  prescribed  security
              clearance requirements, within a period of 12 months.


         4.  Portfolio  Committees   of   the   National   Assembly   should
              accordingly   exercise   stricter    oversight    on    policy
              implementation, as the situation requires.

     Development on  the  Joint  Investigation  Report  into  the  Strategic
     Defence  Procurement  Packages  (the  Procurement  packages),  dated  3
     December 2001:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the matters in  the  Report  falling  within  the
         parameters of its portfolio, and  in  particular  Chapter  13,  and
         having to report  on  the  relevant  findings  and  recommendations
         before 6  December  2001  (Announcements,  Tablings  and  Committee
         Reports, p. 1390-1), reports as follows:


         1. The Portfolio Committee noted the contents  of  the  Report,  in
              particular Chapter 13 and the finding in paragraphs  13.4  and
              14.1.15, in response to the view expressed by the Committee on
              Public Accounts that the main (prime) contracts did not appear
              to be well prepared, namely that the  drafting  of  the  prime
              contracts was of a high standard and that such contracts  were
              found to be  well  defined  and  understandable,  without  any
              instance of particularly clumsy language having been found  to
              have been used.


         2. The Portfolio Committee noted  that  the  National  Director  of
              Public Prosecutions has initiated certain public prosecutions,
              which may be linked to the Procurement packages.


         3. The Portfolio Committee noted  that  the  National  Director  of
              Public Prosecutions has publicly indicated that investigations
              into  possible  criminal  charges  in  connection   with   the
              Procurement packages are continuing, which may lead to further
              public prosecutions in this regard.


         4. The Portfolio Committee noted that the Report does  not  contain
              any  specific  recommendations  relating  to  matters  falling
              within the parameters of its portfolio, including Chapter 13.


         5. The Portfolio Committee recommends that-


              (a) the draft Prevention of Corruption Bill,  presently  being
                  processed by the Department of Justice and  Constitutional
                  Development and the relevant  Interministerial  Committee,
                  be introduced into Parliament, as a  matter  of  priority,
                  in  order  to  address  possible  loopholes  in  our   law
                  identified in the Report, in particular those relating  to
                  various conflict of interest situations and to extend  the
                  current  laws  pertaining  to   corruption   and   related
                  offences of dishonesty; and


              (b)  the  National  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions,  on  a
                  mutually agreed to date in  February,  submit  a  progress
                  report  to  the  Portfolio  Committee,  regarding  further
                  possible criminal investigations and  public  prosecutions
                  emanating from the Procurement packages.


     Report to be considered.

6.    Interim Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts  on  the
     Joint Investigation  Report  into  the  Strategic  Defence  Procurement
     Packages, dated 6 December 2001:


         The Joint Investigation Team's report into  the  Strategic  Defence
         Procurement Packages was submitted to  Parliament  on  14  November
         2001. This report was thereafter referred to  eight  Committees  of
         Parliament, including the Standing Committee  on  Public  Accounts,
         for consideration.


         The Committee agreed that  political  parties  would  independently
         prepare their own questions for clarity on the report of the  three
         investigating agencies.


         The process of interaction with the  Joint  Investigation  Team  on
         questions for  clarity  about  the  Strategic  Defence  Procurement
         Packages occurred on 4 and 5 December 2001.


         The Committee envisages that  it  will  adopt  its  Report  on  the
         Strategic Defence Procurement Packages to the House  on  Wednesday,
         12 December 2001, and therefore requests  that  it  be  granted  an
         extension until that date.

              Pursuing its parliamentary oversight function,  in  accordance
              with Joint Rule 132D of the Joint  Rules  of  Parliament,  the
              Committee visited the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature (the
              Legislature).


              The Eastern Cape was identified as the first  province  to  be
              visited, based on the following motivation:


              (a) It is one of the provinces that has established a  similar
                  committee.


              (b)  It  is  also  one  of  the  rural  and   poverty-stricken
                  provinces.

              province on behalf of the Committee. The  Committee  therefore

     B.  Findings


         1.  Welcoming by Standing Committee


              Mr Chris Motsilili, chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee,
              welcomed the Committee, expressed his sincere appreciation  to
              the Committee for electing to  visit  the  Eastern  Cape,  and
              expressed  the  hope  that  the  Committee  and  the  Standing
              Committee would learn from one another.
              He outlined the programme for the three days.


         2.  Official opening by Deputy Speaker


              The Deputy Speaker of the Legislature welcomed  the  Committee
              on behalf of the Speaker, Mr M  Matomela.  She  gave  a  brief
              background on the establishment of the Standing Committee,  as
              well as its roles and functions.  She  wished  the  Committees
              success on their deliberations.


         3.  Joint meeting


              The joint  meeting  was  co-chaired  by  Ms  Bogopane  and  Mr
              Motsilili.


              Ms Bogopane outlined the aims and objectives of the visit. She
              also outlined the rules establishing our  Committee,  and  its
              role, functions and powers in terms of  Joint  Rules  132A  to
              132D.


              Mr Motsilili took the Committee through the terms of reference
              of the Standing Committee (as stated by the  Deputy  Speaker),
              and said that the Standing Committee was established  in  July
              1999,  before  the  establishment  of  the  Joint   Monitoring
              Committee.


              The  following  differences  between   the   committees   were
              identified,  which  would  require  attention  in   order   to
              facilitate smooth working relations:

         4.  Presentation by OSDP


              The OSDP was established on 1 April 1999, and up to  now  only

                  * Has  the  OSDP  benefitted  from  being  placed  in  the
                    Premier's Office?


                  * Why has there been only one employee in the Office?


                  * What are the barriers that make it  difficult  for  that
                    employee to play a co-ordinating role?


                  * Has the Premier been informed  about  the  lack  of  co-
                    operation from departments?

                  * Non-availability of sufficient funds.


              (c) Weaknesses identified


                  * No effective interaction with the Premier


                  * No co-ordination of rural development


                  *  No  disability  audits  have  been   conducted   within
                    government departments


                  * Disability  projects  have  not  been  monitored,  as  a
                    result of financial constraints


                  * No clear understanding as to why the Office is  situated
                    in the Premier's Office.


         5.  Presentation by PPA


              The delegation was briefed by Ms K Scott, co-ordinator of  the
              PPA, located in the provincial department of welfare.


              (a) Questions asked

                  * What programme have they implemented since inception?

                  * What has  been  the  nature  of  the  division  of  work
                    between the PPA, the Office  of  the  Premier  and  the
                    Standing Committee?


                  * Has the PPA audited legislation regarding children?


                  * What are the frustrations of the PPA?


              (b) Problems identified (which hinders service delivery)

                    policy/programmes   relating   to   children   in   all
                    departments


                  * Programmes and activities are not the responsibility  of
                    the PPA, but of the department of welfare


                  * The location of the PPA in  the  department  of  welfare
                    leads to a lack of budgeted funds and of recognition


                  * The present formation of the PPA excludes civil society


                  * Due to the above, the effectiveness  and  visibility  of
                    the PPA has been non-existent - it has not been able to
                    respond to the needs of children in the province.


              (c) Weaknesses identified (which hinders service delivery)
                  * No budget


                  * No staff


                  * No status


                  * It is not  located  in  a  position  that  empowers  the
                    programme to perform its functions


                  * Mobilisation and co-ordination, as well as  partnerships
                    between the government and civil society, do not exist.

                    Standing Committee?


                  * Why in the Provincial Youth Commission Act  is  the  PYC
                    proposing the appointment of three full-time provincial

                    Committee?

                    Youth Commissions in the National Youth Commission Act


                  * The National Youth Commission Act also does not  outline
                    the relationship between the NYC and PYC


                  * The National Youth Commission Act fails  to  define  the
                    role  of  provincial   governments   in   funding   the
                    operations and programmes of the PYC.

                  * Shortcomings of the NYC are allowed to  influence  their
                    work.


         7.  Outreach visit


              The Committee was divided into  two  groups,  because  of  the
              vastness of the province, and to award members an  opportunity
              to see different things at the same time. The one group  would
              report to the other.

              * Mr M I Moss, Committee member

              The aim was to evaluate the accessibility project, which is  a
              partnership between the PYC, the OSDP and  the  Department  of
              Public Works.


              (a) Accessibility project


                  The project has benefitted young people and  will  benefit
                  disabled people in the future.  The  following  weaknesses
                  were identified:


                  * Before identifying  and  prioritising  buildings,  there
                    was not proper consultation with and agreement  by  the
                    stakeholders, which, for example, led to buildings  not
                    in urgent need of renovations being renovated.


                    The deputy director of the OSDP herself  is  physically
                    disabled. She has been in an  inaccessible  office  for
                    the past two years - she could hardly identify her  own
                    office for renovation.  Also,  there  is  no  sign  for
                    parking for people with disability at the  legislature,
                    where she parks every day. Instead, a primary school in
                    a community in Grahamstown was renovated,  where  there
                    is no disabled child enrolled.


                  * Lack of consultation with people working in  or  heading
                    the  different  institutions  identified  to  be   made
                    accessible.


                    For example: The Grahamstown Day Hospital used  a  ramp
                    for stretchers when ambulances brought patients  there.
                    The ramp can now not be used for that purpose  anymore,
                    as walls have been built to make it  longer  so  as  to
                    enable a person in  a  wheelchair  to  use  it  without
                    assistance. So now the clinic is  inaccessible,  as  it
                    has no ramp for severely ill patients.


                    When we enquired how such a  mistake  can  happen,  the
                    sisters and doctors indicated that  they  were  neither
                    consulted nor informed of the renovations -  they  were
                    not even aware of what else would be happening  to  the
                    clinic. All they knew, was that people had come to take
                    measurements; they never saw the plans or charts.


                  * The project is not supervised by anybody to ensure  that
                    it meets the required accessibility standards,  neither
                    is anybody checking structure quality.


                    At the Department  of  Welfare,  a  toilet  had  to  be
                    renovated by fitting a  slightly  wider  sliding  door.
                    However, all that was done, was to change the  door  to
                    open from the outside instead of the inside, which made
                    it difficult for a person in a wheelchair to  open  it,
                    as it would open towards that person.


                    At Makana Primary School, ramps  were  built,  but  the
                    classroom was still inaccessible. A child would  go  up
                    the ramp, but would not be able to enter the classroom.


                  * The project was not planned; the  stakeholders  did  not
                    agree to the duration of the contract  (the  commission
                    indicated that the department had said  the  money  was
                    finished, but the  contractors  did  not  complete  the
                    work).


                  * The OSDP indicated that it is the South African  Federal
                    Council on Disability  (SAFCD)  that  had  handled  the
                    project.  They  provided  the  list  of  buildings  and
                    accessibility guidelines, and  they  entered  into  the
                    partnership, not the OSDP.


                  *  The  PYC  indicated  that  they  were  responsible  for
                    identifying young people for training as  well  as  for
                    the institutions that trained young people.  They  were
                    further  responsible  for   facilitating   a   way   of
                    integrating these  young  people  at  the  end  of  the
                    project. The employers have taken  some  of  the  young
                    people permanently.


              (c) Visit to Mayor's office


                  We met the Mayor and his councillors, but we  were  unable
                  to hold a meaningful meeting - the lift was  not  working,
                  so we could not reach his office. We were introduced,  and
                  the purpose of the visit to Grahamstown was explained.


              (d) Visit to Youth Multi-Purpose Centre in Cradock


                  This Centre is one of those built by the PCY. The  manager
                  gave a brief background and took us on a tour  around  the
                  building. He indicated that he would no longer be able  to
                  manage  the  Centre,  as  he  was  going   back   to   the
                  Department.


                  The purpose of the Centre was for departments  to  use  it
                  for their youth programmes.  Unfortunately  that  has  not
                  happened yet, as it is  a  well-developed  structure,  but
                  under-utilised at present.


              Group 2


              This group went to  the  Tsolo  Special  School  for  Mentally
              Disabled Children, and consisted of:


              * Mr B Willem, leader of the delegation


              * Ms Hobongwana, Standing Committee member


              * Ms M S Maine, Committee member


              * Ms N Cindi, Committee member


              * Mrs J Witbooi, Committee member


              * Ms C Nkuna, Committee member.


              (a) The principal of the school welcomed the delegation:


                  * In  1977,  the  School  started  catering  for  mentally
                    disabled children only. The vision of this School is to
                    develop and raise the level of self-esteem of  mentally
                    disabled  children  through  education,  training   and
                    practical skills. Through its  mission  statement,  the
                    School is committed to work  in  partnership  with  all
                    stakeholders, so as to ensure that each learner receive
                    the best education.


                  * At present, the School has an enrolment  figure  of  70,
                    and three teachers employed by the government, plus two
                    volunteers and nine non-teachers.


                  * The government, grants  and  school  fees  of  R100  per
                    learner per month fund the school.


                  * The school governing body consists of a  social  worker,
                    a  psychiatric  nurse,  four  parents,  two   community
                    members and the school principal.


              (b) Constraints


                  The principal mentioned the following  problems  hindering
                  the effectiveness of the school:


                  * Lack of access to telephones


                  * Lack of access to electricity


                  * Lack of accommodation


                  * Lack of beds and bedding.


              (c) Meeting with Premier


                  The Committee met with the Premier before  they  left  the
                  province  on  4  May.  Introductions  were  done  by  both
                  chairpersons.


                  The  background  to  the  visit  was  set   out   by   the
                  chairperson of the  Committee.  The  provincial  programme
                  was  outlined  by  the   chairperson   of   the   Standing
                  Committee.


                  The Premier welcomed the Committee to his Office  (not  to
                  the province, as that had already been done by the  deputy
                  speaker). He also thanked  us  for  visiting  the  Eastern
                  Cape.


                  Ms Bogopane highlighted our findings  and  recommendations
                  to  be  considered  by  the  province,  and  referred   to
                  presentations, questions asked and weaknesses  identified.
                  Findings  and  recommendations  in  this  Report  are  the
                  issues raised with the Premier,  recommendations  made  to
                  him and his response to questions.


     C.  Conclusion


         This visit was long overdue - the province required guidance  on  a
         number of areas, and we were in a  position  to  assist.  Committee
         members were exposed to the  challenges  faced  by  provinces,  the
         interpretation of some of the legislation passed  by  the  National
         Assembly and how this  impacts  on  the  lives  of  people  in  the
         province.
         Lack of exposure to a  number  of  activities,  and  to  documents,
         impedes smooth functioning and  interpretation  of  issues  by  the
         province. The impact of poverty  is  a  reality  in  the  province.
         There  is  a  high  level  of  illiteracy,  and  officials  in  the
         Premier's Office lack a  general  understanding  of  the  political
         clout  and  status  of  their  programme  in  relation   to   other
         departments.


         Due to the vast needs of the province,  institutions  such  as  the
         PYC, which is supposed  to  be  co-ordinating  programmes,  end  up
         implementing programmes in order to  try  and  meet  the  needs  of
         young people in the province. This  leads  to  misunderstanding  of
         the  role  of  these  programmes,  and  the  chances  of  it  being
         corrected, are very slim.


     D.  Recommendations


         The Committee recommends that:
              (a) the name and status of the Standing  Committee  on  Youth,
                  Gender and Disabled be changed


              (b) the Provincial Plan of Action for children be relocated to
                  the Premier's Office


              (c) budgets be allocated to programmes, so as to enable it  to
                  function properly


              (d) the OSDP be staffed immediately to ensure that it is well-
                  equipped to respond to the needs of disabled people


              (e)   the   Integrated   National   Disability   Strategy   be
                  provincialised  to  ensure  that  it   responds   to   the
                  immediate needs of disabled people


              (f)  an  awareness  campaign   on   inclusive   education   be
                  established, led by the Standing Committee


              (g) amendments to the promotion  of  youth  affairs  be  fast-
                  tracked


              (h) the amendments in  paragraph  (g)  above  also  include  a
                  reduction in the number  of  commissioners  and  in  their
                  terms of office


              (i) the restructuring of the Provincial  Youth  Commission  be
                  accelerated


              (j) the role of  the  Premier's  Office  be  re-emphasised  to
                  public servants serving  in  that  Office,  and  that  the
                  Standing Committee explain their political  responsibility
                  to them


              (k) the Standing Committee concentrate on  the  implementation
                  and  allocation  of  budgets  to  the  programmes  it   is
                  responsible for


              (l)  the  Standing  Committee  no  longer  deal  with   junior
                  officials but with heads of department


              (m) the Standing Committee monitor all departments,  not  only
                  ones closely linked to it.

     1.  Terms of reference


         The Committee undertook  a  study  tour  to  the  Eastern  Cape  to
         investigate:


         * levels of service delivery


         * conditions under which officials were working


         * interaction between civil society and the government
           at provincial and national level


         * management of poverty relief and other projects
         * extent of poverty in the province


     2.  Background information


         The Committee resolved to undertake  this  visit  as  a  result  of
         several reports in the media and from members  of  Parliament  from
         that province about the conditions of social  service  delivery  in
         the province. This decision was reinforced  after  a  meeting  with
         the MEC for Welfare in the Eastern Cape on 28 March 2001 about  the
         provincial  budget.  It  became  apparent  from  reports  that  the
         conditions are worse in the rural areas of the  former  Ciskei  and
         Transkei. It was  consequently  decided  to  concentrate  on  those
         areas.


         The delegation was led by the Chairperson,  Mr  E  Saloojee  (ANC),
         and comprised of Mr F Bhengu (ANC), Ms  X  C  Makasi  (ANC),  Ms  J
         Chalmers (ANC), Ms S Kalyan (DP), Mr A Z A Van Jaarsveld (New  NP),
         Prof L M Mbadi (UDM), Ms Z Adhikari (Committee Secretary) and Ms  A
         Kakaza (Committee Assistant).


     3.  Summary


         The multiparty delegation spent three days in the Eastern  Cape  in
         an attempt to understand  the  conditions  of  the  people  on  the
         ground and to investigate the  levels  of  service  delivery.  They
         visited  paypoints  and  met   with   officials,   non-governmental
         organisations (NGOs), special projects and the MEC for Welfare.


     4.  Paypoints


         A.  Findings


              Diya Store, Butterworth


              The journey to this paypoint took about 45 minutes on very bad
              gravel  roads.  Officials,  who  have  to  cover  three   main
              paypoints, leave Butterworth at 08:00 in the morning and reach
              the furthest paypoint an hour later. They  start  the  payouts
              here and then begin to work their  way  back  to  Butterworth.
              Officials use Ford bakkies that are quite old and need  to  be
              replaced.


              Payment of grants takes place in a dark sparsely stocked shop.
              There is a single table with an official on either  side.  The
              one official checks the identity document while the other then
              fingerprint the beneficiary and hands over the cheque. A third
              official oversees the process. Beneficiaries  generally  stand
              or sit on the floor. There are no  chairs  or  restrooms.  The
              delegation met several individuals who have applied for grants
              several months ago and were simply told to keep coming to  the
              paypoints every month to see if their grants had come through.
              The delegation met a boy who did not  have  the  use  of  both
              hands and had applied for a disability grant last year but was
              still waiting for a response from  the  Department  of  Social
              Development.


              After receiving their cheques, the beneficiaries rely  on  the
              shop owner to cash them. This is done for a  fee  of  R20  per
              cheque and they generally get their money within a day or  two
              after handing over the cheques. Transport to  town  costs  R24
              return and involves walking quite a distance to the point from
              which taxis operate, so most beneficiaries rely  on  the  shop
              owner. The Community Welfare Forum in the area exists  but  is
              not functioning. The Department  of  Welfare  has  offered  to
              advise the forum when it meets.  These  forums  are  voluntary
              bodies.


              Esingeni Store, Tsolo


              This paypoint is situated about 50 minutes from Tsolo and  the
              roads are extremely poor, with  narrow  crossings  over  dried
              riverbeds.  As  at  Butterworth,  officials  started  at   the
              furthest  point  and  worked  their  way  back   through   six
              paypoints. There are 78 paypoints  in  the  district  and  two
              teams over three weeks are responsible for payment of grants.


              This paypoint consists of a  table  outside  a  shop  with  no
              shelter. The beneficiaries crowd around the officials and wait
              for their names to be called. One official  calls  out  names,
              the second  identifies  the  beneficiary  using  the  identity
              document and the third sitting at the table  fingerprints  the
              person and hands over the cheque. They often deal with  up  to
              6 000 persons per paypoint.  There  is  no  running  water  or
              toilets and beneficiaries have to go to the  river  for  those
              facilities.


              As at Butterworth, the shop owner cashes the cheques. At  this
              place it is done for a fee of 14% commission on the  groceries
              that they had bought on credit for that  month.  Beneficiaries
              are given their money after the shop owner  has taken what was
              owing to him. Beneficiaries at  this  paypoint  also  had  the
              option of cashing their cheques at J H  Security,  a  security
              company, for a fee.


              Officials use a Ford Bantam bakkie, which often  breaks  down.
              In order to complete all  the  payments  the  officials  leave
              Tsolo at 5am and return at nine pm. Officials are  accompanied
              by the police due to the violence and robberies in  the  Tsolo
              area. A problem identified was that many of  the  elderly  get
              beaten and robbed by the youths in the area on the  days  that
              the payouts have been made.


              At this paypoint, members  found  an  aged  lady  lying  on  a
              mattress on the ground waiting for  her  pension  payout.  Her
              daughters brought her to the paypoint, as she was too frail to
              walk there herself. In order for one of  them  to  become  the
              procurator, she would have to travel to Umtata  with  them  to
              make the changes. A member of the Community Welfare Forum said
              that there were many people who had applied for disability  in
              November 2000 but who  have  not  received  anything  yet.  He
              undertook to forward the list of names to the Committee.


              East London Post Office


              The post office is contracted by the  Department  to  disburse
              grants on their behalf. Security at the post office  was  very
              strict and the delegation was not allowed to enter the payment
              halls  until  the  Postmaster-General  gave  permission.   The
              security company only let beneficiaries  with  valid  identity
              documents into the hall, which is attached to the post office.
              A member of the welfare committee was present outside the hall
              to ensure that the process ran smoothly. The  post  office  is
              insured against robberies and is able to get money within  two
              hours if it is stolen.


              The current hall is very small and the payment point was to be
              moved to another larger hall in the building  by  the  end  of
              August to ensure that people did not have to  wait  in  queues
              outside.


              Payment is in the form of cash. Grants were paid in  the  hall
              on the main payout day and paid out at the  post  office  next
              door for the  rest  of  the  month.  Vouchers  are  issued  to
              beneficiaries after  their  identity  document  were  checked.
              These vouchers  are  then  handed  into  another  counter  and
              redeemed for cash. If vouchers were not claimed by the end  of
              the month, then it  would  be  returned.  If  the  beneficiary
              collected  the  following  month,  they  would  be  given  the
              outstanding vouchers for up to three months.


              The  post  office  works  on  a  computerised  system   called
              Postlink, which records  the  vouchers  issued.  The  computer
              system is linked to the national mainframe. A paper backup  is
              created  at  the  same  time.  Any  problems  encountered  are
              referred to Deals House, where  the  regional  office  of  the
              Department of Welfare is situated. There are  no  departmental
              officials present at this paypoint and the post  office  staff
              handles all the transactions. There is currently no help  desk
              at the post office, but they  envision  having  one  when  the
              payments move over to the larger hall.


         B.  Conclusions


              * As a result of  the  advanced  infrastructure  of  the  post
                office that operates in  the  urban  areas,  the  system  of
                payment works better than in the rural areas.


              * Beneficiaries in the rural areas who are  paid  out  by  the
                Department of Welfare, are at the mercy of  the  local  shop
                owners and private companies to cash their cheques.


              * The voluntary welfare committees in the rural areas are  not
                working  effectively  due  to  a  lack  of  information  and
                incentive.


              * The vehicles used by the officials  are  clearly  inadequate
                for the terrain that they have to cover.


              * Information does not reach people in the rural  areas  about
                the categories of grants that they are able  to  access  and
                the requirement that they would need to meet.


              *  The   long   and   difficult   distances   that   potential
                beneficiaries have to travel  hamper  accessing  grants  and
                information. Travelling these distances are also  relatively
                expensive per trip.


              * Many people have been unable to access  grants  due  to  not
                having the correct documentation. Those who have applied for
                documents often have to wait  long  periods  before  getting
                their documents. It is a struggle to rectify  mistakes  such
                as incorrect identity  numbers,  incorrect  ages,  duplicate
                identity  numbers  and  persons  who  have  been   summarily
                declared dead.


              * The crime situation  in  the  rural  areas  intensifies  the
                already unfortunate position of the poor.  People  in  these
                areas are very poor and are thus dependent on the grants  in
                order to survive.


         C.  Recommendations


              * Social workers should be encouraged to go to the rural areas
                at least once a month to inform and  educate  the  community
                about the various grants and the processes of accessing it.


              * Welfare committees should be empowered and developed to play
                a more active role in the communities that they serve.


              * A transport allowance should be made available  for  members
                of the welfare committee so that there is some incentive  to
                take responsibility.


              * Officials should pay house visits to those beneficiaries who
                are too infirm to travel to the urban  centres  to  register
                procurators  or  make  any  other  changes.   Alternatively,
                officials who come out to make  payments  should  bring  the
                relevant forms  with  them  and  set  some  time  aside  for
                processing and dealing with problems.


              *  The  Department  of  Public  Works  must  be  persuaded  to
                intensify its programme of providing  proper  infrastructure
                in terms of roads to the rural areas.
              * The Department of Home Affairs needs to address the  problem
                with regard to the slow processing of identity documents and
                birth and death certificates.


     5.  Welfare and non-governmental organisations


         A.  Findings

             Thembalethu Professional Foster Care Programme


              This programme is part of the  Butterworth  Child  and  Family
              Welfare  Society.  The  Society  was  started  in  1995  as  a
              voluntary organisation and was formally launched in 1996.  The
              foster care programme was started in 1995 to deal with  street
              children and other vulnerable groups.  About  10  mothers  and
              helpers were trained during this time. Children are placed  in
              foster care while their families were  being  traced  and  re-
              unification was co-ordinated. Natural parents are involved  in
              the programme as far as possible.


              In order  to  raise  funds  for  the  foster  parents  and  to
              encourage the  natural  families  to  function  normally,  the
              programme has started the Zenzile  programme.  This  programme
              produces pottery, clothes, embroidered cushions and  bread  so
              that parents are able to generate  an  income  with  which  to
              maintain their children. They have also started  the  Fumaneka
              crop production programme, with 25  men  and  women  producing
              crops for income. In addition to training parents, many of the
              children are empowered with the same skills in order to assist
              in generating an income. The programme, however, noted that it
              was having difficulty selling and marketing its products.


              When the programme started, it did not have  a  social  worker
              and only employed  a  childcare  worker  in  1999.  It  found,
              however, that it was unable  to  place  children  through  the
              court system and was forced to  employ  a  social  worker.  In
              April 2001 they were allocated a subsidy for a  social  worker
              but are unable to afford a childcare worker as well. The Child
              and Family Welfare Society  is  experiencing  a  problem  with
              retaining the services of their social  workers  because  they
              invariably  leave  for   employment   opportunities   in   the
              government, where the pay is  better  and  there  are  greater
              benefits.


              The organisation is committed to an  integrated  developmental
              approach. They work closely with the Siyakhana street children
              shelter. As regards foster care, they incorporated the  family
              preservation programme and do preventative work in the form of
              awareness programmes with parents and children. This  approach
              extends to child-headed households and foster parents who have
              been trained to look after HIV-infected children.


              Non-governmental organisations: Umtata


              * Umtata Child Abuse Resource Centre


                This is a non-profit organisation that  was  established  in
                October 1996 as  a  result  of  the  enormous  need  in  the
                community. It was set up by  various  organisations  and  is
                multi-sectoral in its  approach.  It  has  assisted  in  the
                formation of the Child Protection Units that are attached to
                the SAPS. It has looked at adding another unit,  which  will
                have psychologists, doctors and social  workers.  They  have
                submitted their request for funding  of  this  unit  to  the
                department 13 months ago but have not received any  response
                to date, not even a letter of acknowledgement.


                The main aim of the organisation is the prevention of  child
                abuse. It does this through campaigns at  schools,  churches
                and other community centres. In addition, it  does  research
                into issues of child abuse in order to assist with its work.
                They have a good  relationship  with  the  Child  Protection
                Unit,  the  regional  welfare  office  and  the   provincial
                department of welfare.


                It is finding it increasingly difficult to operate due to  a
                shortage  of  funding  and  human  resources.  Due  to  time
                constraints set by funders, they are  often  in  a  position
                where they are unable to spend the money granted within  the
                specified period resulting  in  them  losing  the  continued
                support from those funders.


                They experience difficulty assisting beneficiaries to access
                the  child  support  grants.  Many   do   not   have   birth
                certificates and the process of obtaining them is difficult.
                They are also finding it difficult to access grants for HIV-
                positive persons who are no longer able to work.


              * Action Group for Children in Distress


                This organisation was started in June 2001  and  deals  with
                relieving distress of children that have been abandoned as a
                result of HIV/AIDS. They designed referral  forms  for  NGOs
                who refer the children to the Action Group. These forms  are
                used  for  statistical  purposes  and  to   get   background
                information on children  before  placing  them  with  foster
                parents. The organisation also gives children grants of R300
                in the form of vouchers or payment of school fees.


                They are dealing with  increasing  numbers  of  orphans  and
                child-headed  households.  Their  working  radius  currently
                covers an area of 20 km and they only have one field worker.


              * SOS Children's village


                They  are  affiliated  to  an  international  child  welfare
                organisation that seeks to help children who are in need  of
                care because they have lost their parents. The  organisation
                provides a home for these  children  in  small,  family-type
                groups. Children are placed in the care of a  foster  mother
                and other  abandoned  children  become  their  brothers  and
                sisters.
                Children come into the care of the SOS  children's  villages
                through  a  statutory   process.   One   of   the   problems
                experienced, is the lack of response or long delays from the
                provincial office. In addition,  it  has  not  received  any
                feedback on its service plans submitted over  the  past  two
                years in line with the current financing policy.


              *   Siyakhana Youth Outreach and Education Programme


                This NPO's mission is to provide  professional  services  in
                the rehabilitation of street children by providing  shelter,
                skills training and assisting  other  similar  organisations
                with skills development. They  were  formed  in  1998  after
                consulting with a wide range of social forces and approached
                the Presidential Projects Trust for funding.  Rehabilitation
                Day Care Centres have been established in  Umtata,  Engcobo,
                Butterworth, Lusikisiki and Mt Frere, as  these  areas  were
                identified as having serious problems with street children.


                Children on the street are persuaded to go  to  the  centre,
                where they are cleaned and fed. They are encouraged to  talk
                about their families  and  interact  with  a  social  worker
                during their stay at the centre. Files are opened  for  each
                child and their families are traced  in  an  effort  at  re-
                unification. Children are also  enrolled  in  school  in  an
                effort to normalise their lives.


                The Umtata and Engcobo centres are funded by the  Department
                of Welfare. Efforts  to  get  funding  from  the  provincial
                government for the other three centres  have  proven  to  be
                futile as there has been no proper response to  applications
                made. The future of these centres is uncertain, as the funds
                received from the Presidential Projects Trust are  about  to
                be exhausted.  An  additional  problem  experienced  is  the
                unavailability  of  social  workers   in   some   districts.
                Experience has shown that they achieved the most success  in
                the areas where they  were  able  to  actively  involve  the
                social workers.


              * Eluxolweni Child Care Centre


                This centre operates within a Christian framework where they
                reintegrate street children back into society  as  empowered
                young people. This is done by working both with  the  family
                and the child. They provide short- to medium-term  physical,
                emotional, educational and spiritual care.  At  their  night
                shelter, they run a skills training centre  for  the  street
                children and the community.


                One of the main problems experienced by the organisation  is
                the shortage of funding which impacts on the manner in which
                they are able to  operate.  The  funding  problem  has  also
                resulted in a situation where they have been unable to  make
                provision for the girl child.


              * Sinawe Referral Centre


                This centre is situated at the Umtata General  Hospital  and
                is  a  multi-disciplinary  service   established   for   the
                management of  victims  of  violence.  They  provide  legal,
                medical, psychological and social  services  to  victims  of
                violence. This is done in conjunction with  other  NGOs  and
                CBOs.  They  also  run  awareness  programmes   within   the
                community about crime prevention. Their services  extend  to
                children affected by crime and violence as well.


                The SAPS had not been deployed in the centre  yet  and  this
                creates problems with regard to the protection of  children.
                They are also experiencing problems with setting up a  place
                of safety and their own transport.


              * Tembelihle Home


                This is an  undertaking  of  the  Umtata  Child  and  Family
                Welfare society and is a place of safety for  abandoned  and
                abused children between the ages of two and  14  years.  The
                children are admitted  through  the  Child  Protection  Unit
                (CPU) or social workers. The children are  cared  for  while
                the CPU and social  workers  complete  their  investigation.
                Children are generally returned to their families. The  home
                was started in September 1997 and has since begun to  employ
                a teacher for the children.


              Non-governmental organisations: East London


              * Advancement of Disadvantaged Project Training Centre


                This is a computer-based training centre that  was  launched
                by the Anglican Church at  Mdantsane  in  1995.  They  offer
                three-month  courses  in  the  fields   of   administration,
                financial management and computer skills. They are committed
                to   empowering   the   disadvantaged   unemployed   people,
                especially the youth.


                One of  their  main  challenges  is  being  able  to  secure
                adequate funding, as  overseas  funders  were  beginning  to
                focus  on  other  African  countries.   Funding   from   the
                Department of Labour has been  cancelled  because  of  their
                expectation of 70% placement after training.


              * Institute of training and education for capacity building


                This organisation was originally an  educational  NGO  whose
                focus was extended to the broader community with issues such
                as HIV/AIDS awareness and social  development.  They  assist
                communities to access grants and are  involved  in  a  crime
                reduction project. They work closely  with  the  police  and
                Child Protection Forums to reduce crime. They have  launched
                AIDS  awareness  programmes  in  schools  and  at  community
                centres.


                Their challenges include the  growing  unemployment  crisis,
                children who are starving and dying in the  former  Transkei
                and the escalation of the AIDS problem.


              * Masimanyane Women's Support Centre


                This organisation is aimed at the empowering of women.  They
                deal with issues of domestic violence, maintenance and child
                support, HIV/AIDS awareness  and  educating  and  empowering
                women about their rights.


                Besides  highlighting  the  problem   with   funding,   they
                indicated that they too are experiencing  difficulties  with
                regard to the inadequate justice system and court  officials
                who were not  taking  the  issue  of  maintenance  seriously
                enough. They feel very strongly that the position  of  women
                has not improved, and noted  that  the  problem  of  poverty
                impacted very strongly on the plight of women.


              * Rural Support Services


                The Rural Support Services focuses on water, sanitation  and
                health issues. They respond to the needs of the community by
                trying to get funding for  projects.  They  also  assist  by
                setting  up  projects  and  programmes  around  health   and
                hygiene.


                They  are  faced  with  challenges  of  lack  of  access  to
                information about processes and rights. Expectations of  the
                community are very high but the delivery of services is very
                slow and people tend to get disillusioned. As a  development
                agency, they are experiencing difficulty getting funding and
                have had to resort to charge  consultant's  fees  for  their
                services.
              * East London Family and Children Welfare Society.


                There are about 40 organisations  that  are  involved  in  a
                social development focus form of welfare. They are forming a
                platform with which to  engage  with  the  government  about
                legislation  and  policy.  They  tend  to  focus  on  family
                preservation and social development.


         B.  Conclusions


              *   Welfare and non-governmental organisations are  unable  to
                retain staff due to better opportunities in the  government.
                Although subsidies are received  regularly,  they  have  not
                been increased for a few years.


              *   Organisations are having increasing  difficulty  accessing
                funding as most of it goes directly to government.
              *    Organisations  need  training  with  regard  to  business
                management skills.


         C.  Recommendations


              *   Organisations must be encouraged to look into the idea  of
                extended families when dealing with orphaned children.


              *   The funding proposals with regard to subsidies must be re-
                evaluated. The subsidisation of non-profit organisations and
                non-governmental organisations must be improved.


              *   Lotto funds must become available for organisations to tap
                into, as many have lost their funding as a  result  of  this
                process.


              *   Government departments at all levels should interact  with
                each other to deal with issues of  poverty,  infrastructure,
                water, sanitation and access to grants. Legislation in  this
                regard should be encouraged.


              *   Civil society must be encouraged to  engage  their  public
                representatives on issues of concern to them. This  type  of
                interaction  should  cut  across  party  lines   to   ensure
                effective delivery.


     6.     Poverty relief and departmental pilot projects


         A.  Findings


              Masiphatisane Club


              A group of five women decided to fight poverty by  starting  a
              sewing project in 1997. They initially started with their  own
              sewing machine and contributed  R60  per  month  to  build  up
              capital. After hearing about the government  assistance,  they
              successfully applied through the local welfare office. At this
              stage  they  were  reduced  to  four  members.   The   initial
              disbursement was R10 000 in July 1999. This money was used  to
              buy an electric sewing machine, an overlocker and fabric  from
              East London. In March 2000 they were given a second tranche of
              R12 000.


              They are experiencing difficulty with selling their  products.
              They have decided not to use any of the money that  they  were
              given by the government, and are attempting to  use  only  the
              profits of their sales.  They  are  currently  not  drawing  a
              salary from the business. They  are  aspiring  to  sell  their
              products in Butterworth and East London and are hoping to  get
              a contract to produce  tracksuits  and  school  uniforms.  The
              local social  worker  has  been  monitoring  the  project  and
              attempting  to  help  them  with  regard  to  their   business
              management, but with very little success.


              The project is currently being run from the home of one of the
              women, who  gets  a  small  payment  to  cover  the  costs  of
              electricity used. There  is  no  real  form  of  security,  as
              members indicate that they trust each other.  The  chairperson
              and treasurer are the signatories  of  the  bank  account  and
              decisions are made by consensus.


              Mhlakulo HIV/Aids home based care project


              This project is attached to a clinic outside Tsolo  and  is  a
              joint integrated project run  by  the  Departments  of  Social
              Development and of Health. It was started in June 2000 and has
              recruited about 55 volunteers. The  volunteers  were  selected
              from people who worked at the clinic. The project was  started
              after consultation with traditional  leaders,  faith  healers,
              Unitra  and  other  community  members.  The  volunteers  were
              identified  and  placed  into  different  categories  after  a
              process of screening. The volunteers have been trained in home-
              based care but still  need  training  in  professional  foster
              care. Volunteers interact with the families  of  the  ill  and
              coach them in caring methods. Families are identified as being
              in need if they meet the requirements set out by the project.


              Transnet has donated containers which will be used as  offices
              and counselling centres. They hope to be fully operational  by
              December  2001.  Volunteers  are  given  a   small   transport
              allowance in order to visit the critically ill and  take  them
              to  hospital.  The  project  has  applied  to   the   national
              Department for cars in order to conduct home visits. They were
              relying on NGOs  in  the  area  to  assist.  The  project  has
              initiated smaller projects in order to produce an  income  for
              the volunteers. They are hoping to  give  volunteers  a  small
              monthly cash payment.


              The home-care packs have not been made available yet but  they
              were relying on the clinic to supply them with  the  necessary
              resources in this regard. Testing is being done in Umtata  and
              there is often a long waiting period  for  results.  They  are
              hoping to start testing at the project by September 2001.


              The project also addresses the plight of children in  distress
              by placing them in foster care. As far as  possible,  children
              are placed within  their  families.  The  process  of  placing
              children gets delayed as a result of some children not  having
              the correct documentation.


              Kidds Beach Development Association


              This project was established as a non-profit organisation  and
              was given funding of R138 000 by the national Department for a
              three-month period from March to June 2001.  The  aim  of  the
              project is to help the community by providing home-based care,
              to help the community access  grants,  setting  up  SMMEs  and
              placing orphaned children. They have formed partnerships  with
              the  regional  and  district  offices  of  the  Department  of
              Welfare, the Department of Labour for training, the Department
              of Home Affairs for identity documents  and  the  Kidds  Beach
              Post Office. The project has trained caregivers  from  all  35
              villages that they service. Monthly reports of their  progress
              have been submitted to the national Department.
              The MEC for Welfare, Ms N Kondlo, had some reservations  about
              the project, as she felt that it extended beyond  its  mandate
              of  home-based  care  for  people  with  HIV/AIDS.  She   also
              indicated  that  the  provincial  government  had  only   been
              informed about the existence of the project two  months  after
              it had been set up. She had not seen the business plans or any
              of the reports that had been submitted on the progress made.


         B.  Conclusions


              * There seems to be very little monitoring of projects on  the
                ground by the disbursing agency or the national Department.


              * Although  applications  are  handed  in  to  the  provincial
                authorities, the decision lies with the national  Department
                to award funding.


              *  The  social  workers  are  unsure  of  their  role  in  the
                monitoring of poverty relief projects.


              * Members running the projects  are  not  very  clear  on  the
                objectives of the business plans. Within the poverty  relief
                project, the women were  starving  themselves  in  order  to
                succeed.


         C.  Recommendations


              *  Projects  must  be  assessed  for  viability  before  being
                approved. Sufficient time must be spent on  the  process  of
                evaluating a project before funding is approved.


              * Communities must  be  given  training  in  developing  their
                business and marketing skills. This  type  of  guidance  and
                education must be ongoing  and  its  effectiveness  must  be
                measured.


              * Projects that are approved, must  be  able  to  benefit  the
                community and not only enrich a few individuals.  They  must
                be designed so that it is able to expand to incorporate more
                people.


              * The relationship between the disbursing agency, national and
                provincial governments must be  clearly  indicated  so  that
                each level is aware of  its  responsibility  and  there  are
                clear lines of communication between them.


              * The  Department  must  ensure  that  projects  are  properly
                resourced if they are to succeed.  The  HIV/AIDS  home-based
                care  project's  lack  of  transport  makes  meeting   their
                objectives extremely difficult.


              *  The  relationships   and   co-operation   between   various
                government departments such as Home  Affairs,  Public  Works
                and Social Development must  be  strengthened  in  order  to
                assist with the realisation of these projects.


              * Comprehensive mechanisms  for  monitoring  must  be  put  in
                place, with responsibilities clearly defined.


     7.  Welfare Offices


         A.  Findings


              Butterworth District Offices


              The district offices are housed in a run-down  house  that  is
              being rented by the provincial Department of Education for R24
              000 a month. The contract expires at the end  of  August  2001
              and they will then share premises with  the  regional  office.
              The property has not been maintained and there is a clear lack
              of resources. Files are generally stored on open shelves or in
              boxes. The cupboards in the kitchen are full of old files that
              have not been stored properly.


              The regional office occupies a small house, which  desperately
              needs to be fixed and renovated. The walls  and  ceilings  are
              unpainted and the floor tiles are  loose  in  several  places,
              making it dangerous to walk on. The  office,  which  processes
              applications, is very small,  resulting  in  applicants  being
              forced to wait outside and be exposed to the  elements.  These
              offices  are  slightly  better   resourced,   as   there   are
              functioning computers loaded with  recent  software  and  they
              have filing cabinets.


         B.  Conclusions
              * The conditions under which the  departmental  officials  are
                expected to work, are not conducive to motivating  them  and
                thus affecting their productivity.


              * The shortage of resources negatively  affects  the  time  it
                takes to process applications.


         C.  Recommendations


              * The Department of Public works must be urged to renovate and
                possibly extend the property  at  the  Butterworth  regional
                office.


              * The provincial budget should take into  account  the  better
                resourcing of regional and district offices.


              * The offices dealing with  members  of  the  public  must  be
                adequately resourced in order to accommodate the elderly and
                disabled.


     8.  Meeting with MEC


         The MEC responded to the following issues that were raised:


         * Grant payouts.


           There are cases of backpay dating from 1996, when the department
           ran out of funds and a moratorium was placed on  the  processing
           of applications. Some officials, however,  continued  to  accept
           applications and as result these were  not  processed.  Many  of
           these files have since disappeared. This has  become  a  problem
           with the new regulation that stipulates  that  backpay  must  be
           backdated to the date of application.


         * Class action court case


           The East London court decided that the administrative action has
           disadvantaged the group of beneficiaries and ordered  that  they
           be reinstated. The  Department  of  Welfare  has  contested  the
           group's status as a class as it comprised of both permanent  and
           temporary disability beneficiaries. The temporary  beneficiaries
           simply had their grant  cancelled.  The  department  is  in  the
           process of locating some of the permanent beneficiaries in order
           to reinstate them.


         * Roads


           The condition of the roads is terrible but it cannot  be  solved
           instantly.  The  Department  of  Public  Works  has  an  ongoing
           infrastructure programme. An amount of  R140  million  has  been
           allocated for the Eastern Cape from  the  R6  billion  that  the
           President has set aside over three years.


         * Cashing of cheques
           The  shopkeepers  who  are  charging  beneficiaries   exorbitant
           amounts for cashing cheques, are  not  involved  in  an  illegal
           activity and it is therefore difficult to stop this practice. It
           is hoped that a decision to change the payment system will occur
           within the next few months.


         * Social workers


           In terms of the  disparity  between  private  and  state  social
           workers, it is hoped that the subsidy will be increased by  next
           year in order to close the gap.


         * Vehicles


           The province has not had any money allocated to it for the  last
           five years for vehicles. The initial amount of R20 million voted
           for vehicles for the current financial year was  reduced  to  R4
           million during the budget review process.
         * Welfare forums


           The department is in the process of putting together a framework
           policy document for welfare  forums.  The  legislature  has  had
           public hearings on the policy,  and  it  is  hoped  that  it  be
           finalised soon.


         * Liaison between provincial and national departments


           Although business plans are processed provincially, the decision
           to award funding is done  nationally  and  funds  are  deposited
           directly from the national Department.  The  province  has  very
           little involvement and is not informed about  disbursements  and
           monitoring.


         * Panels


           It has been agreed  that  panels  should  be  operational  by  1
           December 2001, but there is a need  to  identify  infrastructure
           and budgets. Panels are supposed to replace district surgeons.


         * Identity documents


           There are many identity documents that clash  in  the  province,
           and in certain cases people are "made" younger  than  they  are.
           This is a difficult problem to solve - the  Department  of  Home
           Affairs needs to address these issues.


     9.  Acknowledgements


         The Committee would like to thank:


         * Officials of the regional and district  offices  in  Butterworth,
           Idutywa, Tsolo, Umtata and  East  London,  for  their  time  and
           hospitality.


         * NGOs for their  frank  explanations  and  discussions  about  the
           position they found themselves in.


         * Members of the poverty relief  and  departmental  pilot  projects
           for taking the time to show us the work that they have done.


         * Drivers of Imperial Car Hire for their skill  in  getting  us  to
           the remote areas and back safely.


         * The MEC for taking time out of her busy schedule to talk  to  the
           delegation.

     B.  Background


         1.  Amanzi ayimpilo - Water is life. Water is  perceived  to  be  a
              public  good,  but  South  Africa  is  currently  facing  many
              challenges in respect  of  the  provision  of  water  services
              management.


         2.  Many poor people are unable to pay for water; as a result,  the
              South African government introduced a new policy  in  February
              2000.


         3.  This policy stipulates that a basic amount of 6 000  liters  of
              clean water per month be provided to each household.


         4.  The Committee felt that it was helpful to undertake a  trip  to
              Chile.


              * The key objectives of the study tour to Chile were  to  gain
                an international perspective on the Provision of Basic Water
                Services and Sanitation.


              * Observe the interaction amongst spheres of government.


              * Observe and evaluate challenges  to  service  providers  and
                national, provincial and local governments, arising from the
                provision of these services.


              * Observe and evaluate Public and Private Sector Partnerships.


              * Provide the delegation with an opportunity  to  visit  sites
                (projects) that provide these services.


         5.  Water management and service delivery in Chile


              (a) Chile has a water code that governs the use of water.


              (b) The rights in the water code include water as  a  national
                  property for use by the public.


              (c) These rights are also protected by the Constitution.


              (d) Legislation is in place to  ensure  effective,  beneficial
                  and equitable use of water.


              (e) Legislation also covers the  protection  of  the  resource
                  base in terms of quantity and quality.


         6.  Superintendency of sanitary services


              (a) It is a government agency, whose functions include:


                  *    establishing water rights


                  *    controlling and planning  the  utilisation  of  those
                    rights


                  *    investigating and assessing water resources.


              (b) It is part of the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  under  the
                  General Department of Water Resources.
              (c) The SSS is a non-sectoral entity  -  independent  of  user
                  sectors - and does not carry out development work.


              (d) The CEO of the SSS  is  appointed  by  the  President  and
                  remains in that position as long as he or she  enjoys  the
                  confidence of the President.


     C.  Privatisation of water in Chile


         1. Privatisation of water services in Chile started  in  1999.  The
              decision to privatise water was very difficult and complex.


         2. It was observed that the provision of water to  communities  was
              becoming expensive for the government, and financial resources
              were limited. The following was also observed:


              (a) A lack of coverage in Waste Water Treatment.


              (b) State resources would be liberated for other priorities


              (c) Permanent professional development or empowerment.


              (d) Worldwide management experience.


              (e) Continuous investigation and development.


         3. The government engaged private  sector  companies  from  France,
              the United Kingdom and Spain.


         4. Privatisation is twofold:


              (a) Thirty-year contract.


              (b) Evergreen contract.


         5. There is a national independent regulator,  established  by  the
              government,  to  regulate  these  partnerships   and   quality
              continuity of services and to set up tariffs.


         6.  The  government   is   the   biggest   shareholder   in   these
              partnerships.


         The need for regulation  is  underlined  by  the  fact  that  water
         utilities are suppliers of essential and indispensable services  to
         society  and  industry,  and  their  operation   has   far-reaching
         economic and social effects, beyond those  typical  of  most  other
         economic activities.


         The Chilean  experience  has  shown  that  the  private  sector  is
         reluctant to provide services  in  rural  communities.  When  Chile
         privatised its water services, approximately  30%  of  the  workers
         were laid off. Secondly, workers were appointed for short  periods.
         We also observed that the government has a policy to  provide  free
         basic services to the poor.


         *  MAIPU - the municipality  implements  the  policy  and  delivers
           sanitation services to the poorest of the poor.


         *   Government  -  through   Public   Works   it   negotiates   the
           cancellation of debts owed by people living in extreme poverty.


           Municipalities  have  a  wide  degree  of  flexibility  in   the
           selection of contractual arrangements for the provision of water
           supply and sewerage services.


     D.  Rural communities in Chile


         1. They have their own community structure and their  members  work
              on a voluntary basis.


         2. The government provides funding for  infrastructure,  while  the
              private sector is not involved in these areas.


         3.  Households  that  cannot  afford  to  pay  their  tariffs,  are
              subsidised.


         4. The "enviro-loo" is piloted as an alternative for the  provision
              of sanitation services in rural areas.


     E.  Summary of findings


         1. Chile is a country where treatment of water as an economic  good
              has been undertaken most prominently.


         2. Chile has a public and private partnership  in  respect  of  the
              provision of water services.


         3. The State is the biggest  shareholder,  with  44%,  and  56%  is
              divided amongst a number of smaller companies.
         4.  The  partnerships  are  regulated  by  an  independent   agency
              controlled by the government.


         5. The poor who live under  a  certain  standard,  get  free  basic
              services; there is a policy to follow and declare their socio-
              economic status.


         6. People participate in the provision of services  in  rural/urban
              areas - they are organised in water users' organisations.


         7. With a view to sanitation, an "enviro-loo"  in  rural  areas  is
              being tested as an alternative.


     F.  Concluding remarks


         1. Following South Africa's adoption of a new water policy, it  has
              been useful for the Committee to examine the  water  resources
              management system in Chile.
         2. Water distribution in Chile is characterised  by  broad  private
              sector involvement, which is reinforced by the Water  Code  of
              1981, whereby market transactions are encouraged to distribute
              water and sanitation.


         3.  In  the  past,  the  management  of  multiple  water  uses  was
              centralised in State hands.


         4. Hence, private participation implies changes in respect  of  the
              State's role.


         5. The State has had  to  give  up  some  activities  and  take  on
              others, exercising greater regulatory power and promoting  the
              establishment of more participatory systems for multiple water
              use management.


         6.  After  the  local  government  elections   in   South   Africa,
              municipalities have been assigned new roles (previously played
              by the central government). Many of these are directly related
              to water management services.


     G.  Recommendations


         1. The Chilean experience  in  privatising  water  has  shown  that
              there are two policy options  open  to  governments  regarding
              natural  monopolies  in  public  utility  industries:   Public
              ownership,  as  has  traditionally  been  the  case  in   most
              countries, or private  ownership,  in  which  case  government
              intervention in the form of regulation is necessary to provide
              incentives for productive  and  allocative  efficiency,  which
              competition cannot  provide  in  this  naturally  monopolistic
              industry.


         2. The need for regulation is underlined by  the  fact  that  water
              utilities  are  suppliers  of  essential   and   indispensable
              services to society and the industry, and their operation  has
              far-reaching economic and social effects, beyond those typical
              of most other economic activities.


         3. The Committee believes that an appropriate regulatory  framework
              must therefore be in place before private sector participation
              is introduced in the provision of water  supply  and  sewerage
              services.


         4. The Committee would not support evergreen contracts or even  30-
              year contracts.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Fifteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts  on  the
     Joint Investigation  Report  into  the  Strategic  Defence  Procurement
     Packages, dated 11 December 2001:


     A.  Introduction


         1.  In its Fourteenth Report of 2000 to the National Assembly,  the
              Standing Committee on Public Accounts (the  Committee)  raised
              certain concerns  regarding  some  aspects  of  the  Strategic
              Defence Package procurement process.


         2. The Committee recommended an  independent  and  expert  forensic
              investigation to, "prove or disprove once and  for  all",  the
              allegations of corruption relating to the procurement process.


         3. The Joint  Investigation  Report  (the  Report)  was  tabled  in
              Parliament  on  14  November  2001  and  referred   to   eight
              Committees. This Report of the  Committee  must  therefore  be
              read in conjunction with the  reports  of  the  Committees  on
              Defence,  Ethics,  Finance,  Justice,   Public   Service   and
              Administration and Trade and Industry.


     B.     The Committee, having  considered  the  matters  in  the  Report
         falling within its competence, reports as follows:


         1.  Joint Investigation Team


              (a) The Committee expresses  its  appreciation  to  the  Joint
                  Investigation Team (JIT)  for  the  painstaking,  diligent
                  and  thorough  manner  in  which  it  had  conducted   its
                  investigations.


              (b) It further wishes to  thank  the  JIT  for  the  open  and
                  cordial manner in which it interacted with this and  other
                  committees of Parliament.


              (c) The Committee affirms  its  confidence  in  the  capacity,
                  integrity and independence of the three agencies  involved
                  in the investigation.


              (d) The Committee believes that the manner in  which  the  JIT
                  has  conducted  itself,   has   contributed   to   further
                  strengthening  accountability,  transparency  and  respect
                  for the Constitution and the institutions  it  creates  to
                  support democracy.


     C.  Findings and recommendations
         1.   The  Committee  accepts  the  findings   and   recommendations
              contained in the Report of the JIT, in particular the  finding
              that "No evidence  was  found  of  any  improper  or  unlawful
              conduct   by   the   government.   The   irregularities    and
              improprieties referred to in the findings as contained in this
              report, point to the  conduct  of  certain  officials  of  the
              government departments involved and cannot, in  our  view,  be
              ascribed to the President or the Ministers involved  in  their
              capacity as members of the Ministers'  Committee  or  Cabinet.
              There  are  therefore  no  grounds   to   suggest   that   the
              Government's contracting position is flawed".


         2.  The Committee  notes  that  the  government  has  accepted  the
              findings and recommendations made by the  JIT  in  the  Report
              without reservation.


         3. The Committee further notes and supports  the  ongoing  criminal
              investigations that are being conducted, and urges  that  they
              be concluded speedily.


         4. The Committee commits itself to  monitor,  through  its  ongoing
              oversight role, the implementation of recommendations  falling
              within its area of competence. In this regard,  the  Committee
              wishes  to  draw  particular  attention   to   the   following
              recommendations:


              (a) With regard to acquisition  policy,  the  Committee  notes
                  ACQ1/98, and suggests further refinement in line with  the
                  recommendations contained in  paragraphs  14.2.1,  14.2.2,
                  14.2.4, 14.2.9, 14.2.10 and 14.2.11 of the Report.


              (b) The Department of Defence, Armscor, the National  Treasury
                  and the Department of Public  Service  and  Administration
                  (DPSA),   in   conjunction   with   the   Public   Service
                  Commission, should take the  necessary  steps  to  develop
                  the  rules  and  guidelines,  referred  to  in   paragraph
                  14.2.12 of the  Report,  to  address  the  issues  brought
                  about by conflicts of interest. The DPSA and the  National
                  Treasury should ensure that  these  rules  and  guidelines
                  are implemented in  acquisition/procurement  processes  at
                  all government departments and state-funded institutions.


              (c) In supporting the recommendation  contained  in  paragraph
                  14.2.15 of the Report, the Committee recommends  that  the
                  DPSA give consideration to, and  explore  the  development
                  mechanisms to ensure,  the  declaration  of  interests  by
                  senior  officials  of  the  government  and   state-funded
                  institutions.


              (d) The Report of the JIT makes  mention  of  instances  where
                  officials failed to comply with established guidelines  or
                  deviated  from  prescribed   frameworks.   The   Committee
                  recommends  that  the  conduct  of  these   officials   be
                  subjected to internal investigations to establish  whether
                  disciplinary action is necessary.  The  Committee  further
                  recommends that the relevant departments should report  to
                  Parliament in this regard by March 2002.


              (e) The Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  should  expedite
                  implementation  of  the   recommendations   contained   in
                  paragraph 14.2.14 of the Report, and  should  take  urgent
                  measures to comply with the  recommendation  contained  in
                  paragraph 14.2.5 of  the  Report.  The  Committee  further
                  recommends  that  these  measures  be  extended   to   all
                  industrial   participation   offers   submitted   to   the
                  department.


              (f) The Committee further recommends that matters of  internal
                  controls, proper financial management  and  accountability
                  be  followed  up   urgently   and   implemented   by   the
                  departments   or   parastatals   concerned.    Procurement
                  processes  have  to  be  clearly  defined   and   properly
                  implemented. With this in mind, the  Committee  recommends
                  that the refined policy (as referred to above)  should  be
                  supported by detailed  control  measures  and  procedures,
                  which should give effect to the  recommendations  made  in
                  paragraphs 14.2.3, 14.2.6, 14.2.7, 14.2.8 and  14.2.13  of
                  the Report. The Committee  draws  attention  to  the  fact
                  that the Public Finance  Management  Act,  1999,  requires
                  Accounting  Officers  and  officials  of  departments   to
                  ensure   that   proper   financial   and    accountability
                  arrangements are in place, and where  these  are  lacking,
                  they must ensure that appropriate corrective measures  are
                  taken as a matter of urgency.


     D.  Concluding comments


         1. The Committee, in accepting the Report  of  the  JIT,  concludes
              one aspect of the process initiated in its  Fourteenth  Report
              of 2000.


         2. The Committee, together with  other  committees  of  Parliament,
              will now interact, on an  ongoing  basis,  with  the  relevant
              departments and parastatals to monitor  proper  implementation
              of the recommendations made in the Report of the JIT.


         3. Ongoing criminal investigative work is being  conducted  by  the
              relevant agencies that  will  report  to  Parliament  in  this
              regard in terms of their  legal  mandates  and  through  their
              normal lines of accountability.


         4. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts  recommends  that  the
              National Assembly accept the report of the Joint Investigating
              Team.


         Report to be considered.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:
National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the  Constitutional  Review  Committee,  dated  14  November
     2001:


     The Constitutional Review Committee reports as follows:


     1.     As a result of a very full parliamentary programme and  members'
         many other duties and commitments, the  Committee  met  only  three
         times. The subgroup, whose task it was to consider the  submissions
         received and to plan  the  Constitutional  Literacy  Campaign,  met
         twice only. The result was that the  Committee  did  not  have  the
         time to consider the submissions it had received, as it would  have
         liked to.


     2.     The Committee received 328 submissions. Because no due date  had
         been indicated in  the  advertisement,  submissions  were  received
         throughout the year.
     3.     Issues raised in the  submissions  included  the  following,  in
         order of numbers:


         (a)     Right to possess, bear and use firearms.


         (b)     Death penalty.


         (c)     Rule of Law and fitting punishment for criminals.


         (d)     Electoral system.


         (e)      Chapter  Nine  bodies  -  appointment  of  members,  size,
              performance and efficacy.


         (f)     Multilingualism.


         (g)     Rights and powers  of  local,  traditional  and  indigenous
              leaders.


         (h)     Bill of Rights.


         (i)     Accountability of public representatives.


         (j)     Separation of powers.


     4.     It was apparent from the submissions received that most  members
         of the public did not have a clear understanding of what should  be
         enshrined in the Constitution, and what should be provided  for  in
         legislation. The Committee was very aware of this fact, and  tasked
         its  subgroup  to  investigate  the  possibility  to   initiate   a
         Constitutional Literacy Campaign, to  be  run  countrywide,  before
         the next general election.


     5.     The Committee realised that, when formulating advertisements  in
         future, it would be wise to focus  on  certain  issues  each  year,
         without precluding submissions from the public on  general  issues.
         Political parties should submit representations  on  constitutional
         matters which they regard in need of attention.


     6.     The Committee is of the view that there is a need to clarify its
         role in relation to other parliamentary committees,  which  propose
         and effect amendments to the Constitution.  The  Committee  further
         deems  it  desirable  that  all   envisaged   amendments   to   the
         Constitution also be referred to it for input. The Committee  deems
         it important that there  should  be  a  clear  understanding  among
         parliamentary  committees  about  their  individual  functions  and
         powers. This matter needs to be pursued in 2002.


     Report to be considered.

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises on  Report  of
     Ad Hoc Committee on Report 13 of  Public  Protector,  dated  3  October
     2001:
     A.     Preamble


         The  government  has  a  significant  investment   in   State-owned
         enterprises (SOEs), some of which are of a significantly  strategic
         nature. Shareholding and  corporate  governance  matters  in  these
         enterprises are critical for  the  government,  especially  in  the
         global  and  competitive  environment  in  which   these   entities
         operate. It is essential for the government to  develop  a  focused
         approach in managing its shareholding  portfolio  in  a  consistent
         manner for it to realise maximum value on its investment.


         Report 13 of the Public Protector, as contained in  the  Report  of
         the Ad Hoc Committee's Report, which is the subject matter of  this
         Report to the  House,  highlights  pertinent  corporate  governance
         issues which demand urgent government attention.


         The government's approach to corporate governance is  reflected  in
         the  protocol  on  corporate  governance   for   public   entities,
         published in October 1997. This protocol  encapsulates  global  and
         international corporate governance principles consolidated  in  the
         King Report of 1994. The intention of government  in  adopting  the
         protocol was to provide for  an  appropriate  corporate  governance
         framework to be applicable within all SOEs,  entities,  bodies  and
         organs. What the protocol did  not  accomplish,  however,  was  the
         operationalisation and  compliance  mechanisms  of  the  principles
         contained  therein.  Equally,  the  protocol  does  not  provide  a
         vehicle for a uniform, consistent, co-ordinated and  non-fragmented
         approach  towards  the  management   of   government   shareholding
         interest in SOEs.


         The direct consequence of this deficiency in the  protocol  is  the
         divergent   approach   by   different    government    shareholding
         departments  in  the   implementation   of   corporate   governance
         principles and management of shareholding matters.


         Whilst  the  Public   Protector's   Report   highlights   corporate
         governance shortcomings within a specific context of  the  CEF  and
         SFF, in essence it calls  for  remedial  actions  on  the  part  of
         government to avoid a recurrence  of  these  and  of  some  of  the
         corporate governance transgressions  within  the  general  body  of
         SOEs. The purpose  of  this  Report  therefore  is  to  attempt  to
         address the questions the Public Protector's Report poses.


     B.     Purpose


         The purpose of this Report is to report  to  National  Assembly  on
         the following:


         1. Issues of corporate governance in State-owned enterprises.


         2.  An  integrated  approach  to  the  management  of   the   State
              shareholding in State-owned enterprises.


         3. To respond within a broad framework to  questions  arising  from
              the Public Protector's Report and possible responses thereto.


     C.     Background


         The need for this Report arises  from  a  report  referred  to  our
         Committee by the Ad Hoc  Committee  on  Report  13  of  the  Public
         Protector, indicating corporate governance breaches  and  requiring
         that these be addressed. In view of  that  Report,  this  Committee
         was entrusted with a responsibility  to  consider  certain  matters
         and report to the National Assembly.


     D.     Summary


         The current situation is that shareholding in the SOEs  is  located
         in different government departments, and  that  governance  matters
         are handled  in  a  diverse,  varied  and  fragmented  manner  from
         department to department. This leads to uncertainties in both  SOEs
         and  the  departments  themselves,  and   ultimately   results   in
         difficulties in managing governance issues.


         The fragmented approach in  handling  governance  matters  is  also
         experienced with other public entities at national  and  provincial
         level. To this end, some of  the  responsible  departments  at  all
         levels of government, it is submitted, have not even had  sight  of
         the Protocol on Corporate Governance.


     E.     Discussion


         Report 13 of the  Public  Protector  and  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee'd
         subsequent Report clearly indicate the  following  issues  relating
         to Corporate  Governance  within  the  SOEs,  public  entities  and
         government:


         1. The need for a board  with  a  balance  of  Executive  and  non-
              executive directors (refer to  point  9,  page  153,  of  that
              Report). The Report also indicates that  reference  should  be
              made to the King Report on Corporate Governance  for  guidance
              in addressing these matters.


         2. The  Report  indicates  a  need  for  a  uniform  approach  when
              addressing corporate governance matters within the government.
              It indicates that ..."the State Institutions should  form  the
              model for good Corporate Governance" (point 10, page  153,  of
              the Report).


         The Report imposes  an  obligation  on  those  entrusted  with  the
         custodianship of State assets to manage those in a manner  that  is
         in compliance  with  the  principles  of  corporate  governance  as
         espoused in the Corporate Governance Protocol  for  use  in  Public
         Entities, published in October 1997.


         These principles include:


         (a)      Criteria  for  the  appointment   of   boards,   such   as
              appointments, remuneration,  accountability,  ethics,  probity
              and overall performance of the board and public entities.


         (b)      Roles  of  shareholders  in  relation  to  clarifying  the
              multifaceted roles of the Government as  a  shareholder.  This
              includes  clarifying  reporting  by  public  entities  to  the
              respective government departments.


         (c)      Financial  reporting,  transparency  and  auditing,   both
              internal and external. Financial reporting presupposes  having
              proper  business  plans,  strategic  plans  and  restructuring
              plans. Financial reporting also  includes  a  report  on  tax,
              dividends, recapitalisation and other financial matters.


         (d)     Communication and participation by all stakeholders.


         (e)     Technology, risk management and fraud detection plans.


         (f)     Compliance  with  instruments  of  good  governance,  which
              include legislation, memoranda and  Articles  of  Association,
              the Protocol on Corporate  Governance,  Shareholder  Compacts,
              Internal Business Policies and Procedures.


         In giving effect to the  Protocol  and  the  Treasury  Regulations,
         shareholder compacts have been developed for use in the  SOEs.  The
         shareholder compact is  an  annual  performance  agreement  entered
         into between the boards and the shareholder. It  seeks  to  clarify
         the roles and responsibilities  of  the  parties  and  to  set  the
         performance targets to be attained by SOEs annually in  an  attempt
         to achieve long-term targets set out in  corporate  plans.  If  the
         objectives and goals are set out in the  shareholder  compacts  and
         their supporting documents, as well as in the corporate  plans,  it
         is anticipated  that  there  could  be  real  maximisation  of  the
         shareholder  value,  as  envisaged  in  the  Restructuring   Policy
         Framework of Government.


     F.     Recommendations


         In the light of the above, the House is requested to  consider  the
         following recommendations as a way forward in handling the  State's
         shareholding and governance matters:


         1. That government departments  entrusted  with  responsibility  of
              managing shareholder matters, attend to  these  matters  in  a
              uniform manner. This can be  achieved  by  adopting  the  same
              processes  in  implementing  the   principles   on   corporate
              governance as reflected in the Protocol, the King  Report  and
              in paragraph E above. There has to be strict  compliance  with
              these policies as soon as they are adopted.  This will  assist
              in eliminating the fragmented approach in  handling  corporate
              governance matters.


         2. The shareholding of SOEs should be  handled  in  a  manner  that
              allows for growth and prosperity, by defining the  mandate  of
              SOEs and  allowing  the  management  to  give  SOEs  strategic
              direction that will maximise their potential in business. This
              can  be  achieved  by  removing  the  uncertainties  that  the
              management  of  SOEs  encounter  on  a  regular  basis.  These
              uncertainties generally arise from the  multifaceted  role  of
              government as a shareholder, regulator and stakeholder through
              various departments and at  times  one  department  performing
              most, if not all, of these roles.


         3.  A  shareholding  model  will  have  to  be  considered  by  the
              government.  This  model  will  assist   the   government   in
              addressing the fragmentation and  unco-ordinated  approach  in
              handling the shareholding issues.


         4.  While  the  government  is  restructuring  its  SOEs,   it   is
              understood that this is done to achieve maximum  efficiencies.
              It has, however, to be understood that whatever asset has  not
              been restructured such asset,  should  also  attain  the  same
              level of efficiency. This can  be  achieved  where  all  these
              assets are managed through one system of  shareholding,  which
              will  consider  the  investment  possibilities  and   a   full
              realisation of the shareholder value.


              Various models exist in  various  countries,  where  they  are
              being used successfully. In Ghana, for example,  a  Commission
              called the State Enterprises Commission is responsible for all
              state businesses and manages government shareholding  therein.
              In Singapore, a "Holding Company Model" known  as  Temasek  is
              the  shareholding  company  used,  whilst  in  Australia   the
              Treasury and the Auditor-General's Office are used  to  manage
              government shareholding. In New Zealand the  vehicle  used  is
              known as the Crown Company Monitoring and Advisory Unit. India
              has a model akin to our Department of Public Enterprises as  a
              vehicle for managing all State-owned Enterprises' shareholding
              interests. These models have to be investigated further with a
              view to finding a model that will be able to address the South
              African socio-economic requirements.


         5. In the meantime, extensive workshops for departments,  provinces
              and even Parliament are necessary  to  enhance  the  level  of
              awareness and to entrench a culture of good  governance,  both
              in government and in business. These workshops should also aim
              at clarifying the responsibilities of the government as a sole
              or major shareholder, and how it relates to other shareholders
              where it is not the sole  shareholder.  The  workshops  should
              also be extended to all  public  entities,  popularising  good
              governance ethos within the entities.


         6.  Those  departments  that  have  made  significant  progress  in
              developing a culture of corporate governance,  should  take  a
              lead in driving these issues to avoid reinventing  the  wheel,
              whilst others need to be fully capacitated  to  address  these
              issues as a matter of urgency.


         7.  Some  systems  are  already  in  place  and  others  are  being
              developed to ensure that shareholding  of  governance  matters
              are given effect to. These systems include the database of all
              Public Entities,  the  database  of  non-executive  directors,
              board  appointments  and  remuneration  policies   and   board
              selection processes (including  the  induction,  training  and
              monitoring of performance of board members). There is always a
              scope for learning as the processes  unfold,  and  departments
              can learn from each other and can improve  on  what  has  been
              done.


         8. Parliament should take a keen interest and play an  active  role
              in  promoting  corporate  governance.  In   this   regard,   a
              Parliamentary  Committee  on  Corporate  Governance  could  be
              established. Such a step will contribute significantly in  the
              development of  a  culture  of  corporate  governance  in  the
              country and in line  with  international  trends,  namely  the
              promotion of the role of Parliament in corporate governance.

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     The President of the Republic submitted the following letter,  dated  4
     January 2002,  to  the  Speaker  of  the  National  Assembly  informing
     Parliament of the employment of  the  South  African  National  Defence
     Force:


         Dear Madam Speaker,


         EMPLOYMENT  OF  THE  SOUTH  AFRICAN  NATIONAL  DEFENCE   FORCE   IN
         COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF
         SOUTH AFRICA TOWARDS THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY


         This serves to inform the National Assembly that I  authorised  the
         employment  of  South  African  National  Defence   Force   (SANDF)
         personnel to fulfil the international obligations of  the  Republic
         of South Africa towards the OAU  Mission  in  the  Federal  Islamic
         Republic of Comoros (FIRC).


         This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions
         of Section 82(4)(b)(ii) read with Section 227(1)(b) and (c) of  the
         Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 (Act No. 200  of
         1993), [which Sections continue to be in force  in  terms  of  item
         24(1) of Schedule 6 to the Constitution of the  Republic  of  South
         Africa, 1996 (Act No. 108 of  1996)],  read  further  with  Section
         3(2)(a)(v) of the Defence Act, 1957 (Act No. 44 of 1957).


         A total of 4 personnel has been deployed  to  the  Federal  Islamic
         Republic of the Comoros (FIRC) to  act  as  military  observers  as
         part of the  OAU  Military  Observer  Mission  to  the  Comoros  to
         oversee the operation of arms collection on the island of Anjouan.


         The deployment is made up of:


              (a) 1X Colonel - Small arms expert to lead the mission
              (b) 1X Major - Small arms expert
              (c) 1X Warrant Officer - Secretary
              (d) 1X Warrant Officer - Small arms expert


         The SANDF members have been deployed for a total of  21  days  with
         the possibility that members  may  be  required  to  deploy  for  a
         maximum period of up to six months to cover possible  extension  of
         the mission.


         The expected costs for the deployment of personnel for 21  days  up
         to a maximum of 180 days (6 months) to  the  mission  area  are  as
         follows:


              (a) Deployment of 4 personnel for 21  days  (accommodation  in
                  tents)R34 740,30
              (b) Deployment of 4 personnel for 21  days  (accommodation  in
                  hotelR30 064,86
              (c) Deployment of 4 personnel for 180 days  (accommodation  in
                  tents)R222 059,69
              (d) Deployment of 4 personnel for 21  days  (accommodation  in
                  tents)R181 984,49
              (e) Transport and accommodation for mobilisation (two  members
                  to mobilise from Cape Town -  costs  already  included  in
                  the above totals)R10 000,00


         The total cost may thus amount to a total  of  between  R30  064,86
         and R222 059,69.


         The Department of Defence is responsible  for  the  costs  of  this
         deployment.


         I will also communicate this report to the Members of the  National
         Council of Provinces, and  wish  to  request  that  you  bring  the
         contents of this report to the notice of the National Assembly.

         Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), setting  out  reasons  why
         the Annual Report and Financial Statements  of  the  South  African
         Telecommunications Regulatory Authority for 2000-2001 could not  be
         tabled in time:


         Dear Colleague


         ICASA TABLING OF ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR  2000-
         2001


         The 2000 ICASA Act provided for the merger  of  the  South  African
         Telecommunications   Regulatory   Authority   (SATRA)    and    the
         Independent  Broadcasting  Authority.   These   institutions   were
         established under the 1996  Telecommunications  Act  and  the  1993
         Independent Broadcasting Act respectively.


         ICASA was established on 1 July 2000 in terms  of  the  2000  ICASA
         Act.  The  ICASA  Annual  Report  for  2000-2001  was   tabled   in
         Parliament in August 2001.


         The Annual Report for SATRA (1999-2000) was not tabled due  to  the
         delay in the  finalisation  of  the  report  by  the  newly  merged
         regulation and the integration challenges. I regret that my  letter
         of explanation was not filed  at  the  same  time  the  report  was
         filed.


         I trust that the above explanation is satisfactory. Please  let  me
         know if you would like additional information.
         Yours sincerely




         Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri
         MINISTER

         Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), setting  out  reasons  why
         the Annual Report and Financial Statements  of  the  South  African
         Post Office for 2000-2001 could not be tabled in time:


         Dear Madam Speaker


         TABLING OF SAPO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2000/2001


         I  sincerely  apologise  that  the  Annual  Report  and   Financial
         Statements for 2000/2001 of the South African Post Office were  not
         tabled in Parliament  within  six  months  after  the  end  of  the
         financial year as required by the Public  Finance  Management  Act,
         1999 (Act No 1 of 1999). There are a number of  reasons  why  these
         financial statements were not tabled timeously.


         First, there was a senior management vacuum  in  the  Post  Office.
         The Chief Executive Officer was appointed in August  2000.  He  had
         to focus on  recruiting  his  executive  management  including  the
         Chief Financial Officer who was only appointed late 2001.


         Secondly, a new Board was appointed in  January  2001  with  a  new
         Chairperson. They found the state of  affairs  not  acceptable  and
         hence had to scrutinise the finances thoroughly.


         Thirdly, in the  same  financial  year,  new  auditors  had  to  be
         appointed. This process added to the delays.


         Fourthly,  the  Strategic  Management  Partnership  with  the   New
         Zealand Post entered into in 1999 had not been able  to  solve  the
         above-mentioned problems. This partnership had  to  be  terminated.
         This process added its fair share in taking  energies  of  the  new
         management   and   the   Board   away   from   its   day   to   day
         responsibilities.


         We now have a full  compliment  of  Executive  management  who  are
         skilled, and an enthusiastic Board with a range of expertise.


         I would like to assure you that we will endeavour  to  ensure  that
         the  South  African  Post  Office  reports  be  tabled   on   time.
         Meantimee, I have received the statements for  the  financial  year
         under discussion and they will be tabled accordingly.


         Yours sincerely






         Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri
